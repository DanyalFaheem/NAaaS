0,"Article 184(3) invoked in sacking case to protect basic right, says SC","The parliament’s only intent behind restoring the employees was to deliver them of their agony, contends AGP.","ISLAMABAD: Justice Umar Ata Bandial of the Supreme Court observed on Thursday that the proceedings in the sacked employees case had been converted from a review hearing into Article 184(3) jurisdiction in order to safeguard the petitioners’ fundamental right to livelihood.
At the same time, Justice Bandial added, the Supreme Court had a duty to preserve the sanctity of the Constitution and to discourage the recruitment of incompetent persons.
Justice Bandial made these observations during the hearing of a set of petitions seeking review of the court’s Aug 17 judgement that rendered almost 17,000 government employees jobless. The ruling will be delivered on Friday (today).
On the eve of his retirement, Justice Mushir Alam had on Aug 17 declared as illegal and unconstitutional a PPP era law, known as the Sacked Employees (Reinstatement) Ordinance Act 2010 (SERA), under which thousands of people were employed or promoted.
As usual, a large number of sacked employees and their family members, including women and children, waited outside the Supreme Court premises on the Constitution Avenue, steeling themselves to spending yet another chilly night under the skies so that they could hear the court judgement on Friday.
During Thursday’s hearing, Attorney General of Pakistan (AGP) Khalid Jawed Khan said if parliament had no right, what was the need of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in the United States, which prohibited discrimination in public places and held as discriminatory any employment based on race, colour, religion, sex or national origin.
“The SERA should be seen as an aberration,” the AGP argued, saying that “as a nation we’re prone to such aberration after every 10 years”. 
The parliament’s only intent behind restoring these employees was to deliver them of their agony, he said.
Justice Qazi Mohammad Amin Ahmed posed a question whether the parliament could alter the Constitution’s basic structure and whether it enjoyed any adjudicatory authority to create a certain class of citizens.
The AGP replied: “If a law that offers relief to a section of society can cause irreparable damage to the principles of constitutionalism, then go ahead and dismiss these review petitions.”
Rectification of a wrong
The AGP argued that in the parliament’s perception, a wrong was done through en masse termination of thousands of employees by the executive. adding that the court should see SERA as merely the rectification of a wrong done years ago.
He emphasised that contrary to a perception that these employees were appointed in violation of the principles of transparency, all formalities were adhered to. 
Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah conceded that the parliament could create a class in a downtrodden district in the public interest to reach out to affected people by giving certain jobs. 
The weakness in the case was that the majority of the employees were either probationers or employed on contract basis, he said adding neither the employer nor the employee presented any termination letter before the court. 
The AGP pleaded that in case the court was considering the compensation aspect in the matter since many of the employees had performed services for ten or more years, it would amount to losing of their jobs altogether.
When Justice Shah stated that the court had yet to understand the wisdom of the parliament behind enacting SERA, the AGP replied it was equally wrong to terminate such a large number of employees with the stroke of a pen.
The AGP emphasised that maximum deference must be shown to parliamentary decisions, adding that the parliament must get the credit where it is due.
The AGP said the court should maintain that the law was sustainable and met the requirements of Articles 9, 14 and 25 of the Constitution. Such a move would save thousands of jobs, he added. 
Referring to a set of proposals placed before the apex court on Wednesday, the AGP reiterated the employees from Grade 1–7 should be reinstated, but those from Grade 8 and above would undergo the appointment procedure prescribe by the FPSC.

Addressing a press conference along with federal Minister for Defence Production Zubaida Jalal on Thursday, Mr Umar said that to overcome the power supply crisis in Gwadar the government was working on a plan to link Makran division with the national grid.
He said the Frontier Works Organisation had been tasked with completing the project as soon as possible, adding that the Quetta Electric Supply Company had already signed an agreement with the FWO. He hoped that the project would be completed by 2023, adding that Gwadar would get 100MW of electricity from the national grid.
Mr Umar said solar panels would be provided to 3,200 houses in Gwadar with Chinese help and the project would be started in March next year. 
He said since Shadi and Swad dams had been completed, the water problem would be overcome to some extent while the government was also taking steps to remove hurdles in water supply to old settlements in Gwadar town.
He said China had established two vocational centers in Gwadar where local youths would get training in various skills.
He said China was building a 150-bed hospital in Gwadar and 20 per cent of work on the project had been completed.

2,"OIC meeting to help bridge gap between Taliban, world: minister",Qureshi says whole region will benefit if things go right.,"ISLAMABAD: Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Thursday said that with members of the international community and the Taliban at the same platform, the coming meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Islamabad would prove to be a stepping stone in finding solutions to the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan.
The foreign minister, flanked by Information Minister Chaudhry Fawad Hussain in interaction with journalists and anchorpersons, said by hosting the event, Pakistan was playing a positive role by bridging the communication gap between the world and the Taliban.
FM Qureshi confirmed that a Taliban delegation, headed by the interim foreign minister, would participate in the moot, besides special representatives from the United States, Russia and China.
Apart from P5 countries, the representatives of Germany, Canada, Australia and Japan had also been invited, he added.

Qureshi says whole region will benefit if things go right

He said Pakistan wanted the Taliban to listen to concerns of the international community relating to human rights.
He said Pakistan was not the spokesperson for the Taliban, but only wanted to bring the stakeholders to the OIC platform to directly get across their points of view.
The foreign minister said Pakistan’s focus was improvement in the lives of Afghan people who faced conflict for decades.
“We are not limiting ourselves to any particular faction or group in Afghanistan,” he said.
He dismissed the impression that holding of the OIC conference on Afghanistan was a step towards recognising the government.
Mr Qureshi said the moot offered a rare opportunity for peace and stability in Afghanistan.
The whole region would benefit if things go right. But in case the situation moved the wrong way, all gains would come to naught, he warned.
He recalled that during his meetings with his counterparts in New York and the recent meeting with the High Representative of the European Union, Josep Borrell in Brussels, he explained that Afghanistan would be facing a tough situation if the EU did not take any action.
He mentioned that several ambassadors who had served in Afghanistan, including Ryan Crocker, former commander of ISAF Forces General John F. Campbell, Commander US Central Command and Director CIA General David Petraeus, and Secretary State for Economic and Business Affairs Ambassador Earl Anthony Wayne were of the view that international sanctions on Afghanistan should be reviewed immediately.
Mr Qureshi said 75 per cent of Afghanistan’s budget was dependent on external assistance. He pointed out that the country’s monetary reserves of $9.5 billion was frozen.
The foreign minister urged the international community to understand that any chaos and anarchy in the wake of the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan would lead to the strengthening of terrorist organisations.
All the efforts and foreign investment of 20 years in Afghanistan, besides the loss of innocent lives, would prove to be futile with the rise of a new wave of terrorism, he said.
He said the situation would not only affect Pakistan, but also other countries of the region, including Iran and Tajikistan, and even Europe.

3,Man accused of criticising CJP granted bail by IHC,The SCBA had earlier demanded stern action against the man and called for putting him behind bars.,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court on Thursday granted post-arrest bail to an accused facing charges of objectionable and inappropriate utterances against Chief Justice of Pakistan Gulzar Ahmed and the judiciary. 
IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah accepted the post-arrest bail petition of Masoodur Rehman Abbasi against Rs5,000 surety bonds.  
A Supreme Court bench had in June this year taken notice of the matter after the Executive Committee of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) at its meeting demanded stern action against the false accusations made in the video clip and also called upon the federal government and law enforcement agencies to arrest Abbasi and put him behind bars so that he could be made an example for the public at large in such a manner that no one dared to repeat this vulgarism ever against judges.  
He was booked under various sections of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) and the Pakistan Penal Code and subsequently taken into custody and put behind bars.  
Masoodur Rehman Abbasi was a local leader of the Pakistan Peoples Party in Sindh. The SCBA condemned the inappropriate language used against CJP Gulzar.
