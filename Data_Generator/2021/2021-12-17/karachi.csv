0,71 inmates at Karachi's Malir jail found infected with hepatitis,"According to experts, there are between 12 million and 15m people infected with either hepatitis B or C in Pakistan.","KARACHI: Despite having the rules requiring screening of newly incarcerated inmates for major infectious diseases, an alarmingly high number of prisoners at Malir district jail were found to be infected with hepatitis B and hepatitis C during a screening camp. 
According to a press release, 71 inmates at the district jail were found infected with hepatitis B and C at a 10-day vaccination/screening camp, which concluded on Thursday at the prison.
The infected prisoners, it said, were also drug addicts. 
A total of 3,396 inmates were vaccinated against hepatitis B at the camp, which included awareness sessions on the blood-borne viral infection. 
Speaking to Dawn, Dr Zulfiqar Ali Dharejo, additional director of the Hepatitis Programme, Sindh, who led the camp, said the staff carried out PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests of 3,467 prisoners. 
“Hepatitis B and C are common among prisoners. The reason is the use of contaminated syringes that prisoners shared for injecting drugs. Our aim for holding the camp was to protect prisoners and their families,” he said. 
About the relevant prison rules, he said that while there were rules in place requiring screening of new prisoners for infectious diseases, he was not aware of their status of implementation. 
Asked about rehabilitation of drug addicts, he said the focus of his department was hepatitis. 
“It’s the first time we carried out the hepatitis screening of all inmates at the jail in a camp. Now, when these inmates have been identified, we will carry out further investigation into their individual cases to look into their disease status and to provide treatment.” 
In the case of hepatitis C, he said, the medicine was generally given for only three months whereas the treatment of hepatitis B would continue for life. 
Last year, the federal minister for human rights while presenting a report before the Islamabad High Court (IHC) stated that at least 5,189 prisoners housed in jails across the country were suffering from diseases like HIV/Aids, and hepatitis C. 
According to experts, there are between 12 million and 15m people infected with either hepatitis B or C in Pakistan, while at least 150,000 new cases are reported every day. 
Independent data suggests that hepatitis B and C have proved far more lethal than Covid-19 so far, taking between 300 and 325 lives every day in the country. The actual number of infections may be far higher since a large number of cases go unreported.

1,Eve-teasing lands rowdy youth in jail for two months,Court finds accused guilty on the basis of a viral video in which he was seen  harassing a young woman on Sharea Faisal...,"KARACHI: A court sentenced a man to two months in prison for harassing a woman travelling in a rickshaw. 
Muhammad Hamza was found guilty of teasing and annoying Zoya while she was travelling in a rickshaw on Sharea Faisal on July 18 this year. 
A video of the incident had gone viral on social media sparking public outrage and call for an action against the group of motorcyclists seen teasing and harassing the female rickshaw passenger.
Judicial Magistrate (central) Niaz Hussain Kandhro pronounced his judgement reserved after recording evidence and final arguments from both sides. 
The judge noted that neither the presence of the accused at the time and day of the incident was denied, nor he (accused) refuted the video that went viral on the social media. 

Court finds accused guilty on the basis of a viral video in which he was seen  harassing a young woman on Sharea Faisal

The judge handed down one-month imprisonment to Hamza for committing an offence punishable under Section 294 (obscene acts and songs) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and also ordered him to pay Rs10,000 fine. In case of default, he would have to undergo an additional imprisonment for one week. 
The judge also sentenced him to one month in prison for committing an offence punishable under Section 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) of the PPC and also ordered to pay Rs10,000 fine. 
The judge recalled bail of the convict and sent him to prison to serve out his sentences. 
According to the prosecution, the complainant after meeting a friend was going home in a rickshaw on Sharea Faisal when motorcyclist Hamza along with six to seven other motorcyclists started raising voices and shouting. 
They also started making obscene acts/signals and kept shouting improper words saying “come and sit on our bikes etc”. 
The complainant testified that as she started to record their acts with her mobile phone, some of the bikers went away while two motorcyclists said: “You should show this video to your mother at home”. 
“When they saw me recording the video the present accused (Hamza) got annoyed and put his hand on the rickshaw, asking its driver to stop, but the driver did not stop,” she added. 
The complainant said that upon reaching near a traffic police post the rickshaw driver stopped upon which the accused escaped. The complainant said after staying there for some time she left the place in the rickshaw and reached her home. 
She narrated the entire episode to her family members and also uploaded the videos of the accused on the social media. 
She deposed that after two days police officials visited her house and recorded her statement and subsequently an FIR was registered. 
State prosecutor Abdul Hafeez Maitlo said the accused was the real culprit, who was clearly visible in the video footage available on the social media. 
The prosecutor said after this video went viral on social media the police authorities/law enforcement agencies took legal action against the accused and arrested him after proper inquiry. 
He asked the court to punish the accused according to the law. 
On the other hand, defence counsel Ali Akhtar contended that his client was innocent and had been framed in the present case. He pleaded the court to acquit the accused.

4,"Around 500 drug peddlers operating in Karachi, says police report","The majority of drug peddlers in Karachi are involved in street crimes, reveal police.","KARACHI: Amid an alarming rise in the use of drugs, a recent report of the intelligence arm of the Sindh police has revealed that around 500 drug peddlers are operating in different parts of the metropolis, it emerged on Thursday.
The report, prepared by the Special Branch, said that until recently the total number of drug peddlers in Karachi was 1,300 and with the efforts of law enforcement agencies 800 of them had been arrested.
Quoting the report, Additional Inspector General of the Special Branch Ghulam Nabi Memon, who is currently the acting chief of Karachi police, told Dawn that Sindh police chief Mushtaq Mahar had estab­lished ‘inter-district teams’ to launch a crackdown against drug dens and peddlers in Karachi and other parts of Sindh as part of a comprehensive strategy of the provincial government to curb the use of drugs in the society. 
Four rehab centres planned
He said that the Sindh government was planning to set up four rehabilitation centres in the city in the first phase for the rehabilitation of a growing number of drug users as the majority of them were involved in street crime. 
He said the provincial government had recently got passed a law from the Sindh Assembly to amend the existing anti-narcotics law by enhancing punishment and including drugs like ‘ice’, ‘crystal’ etc, in the definition of drugs.
He said ‘ice’ and ‘crystal’ were expensive and consumed mostly by affluent youths. 
Addl. IG Memon said that Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah was spearheading a campaign for elimination of drugs as all law enforcement agencies and federal government had realised that it was a serious issue and concerted and collaborative actions were required to tackle it. 
He recalled that in the past, the performance of the police was assessed on the basis of the quantity of drugs they seized, but that criteria had been changed now. “If the drug seizures are growing, it means there is some weakness or inefficiency on part of the police,” he opined.
He confirmed that 800 drug peddlers, out of total estimated 1,300, in Karachi alone had been arrested. 
Legal flaws
The senior police officer said keeping in view the record that suggested that drug peddlers either easily got bail or handed down minor punishment by courts, a team comprising four SSPs having sufficient legal knowledge was set up to identify possible flaws in the existing laws. 
He said the team had pointed out many things including the absence of any lab to test the seized drugs that resulted in acquittal of many accused. He said that many accused opted to plead guilty before the trial court as they knew judges would take a lenient view in handing down sentence to them if they entered a guilty plea. 
He said these aspects were also taken up by the top authorities before the provincial government and the superior judiciary.
On its part, he said, the Sindh government had amended relevant laws this year to enhance minimum punishment to five years.
Besides, it had also established a lab at the University of Karachi for testing the seized drugs. In the amended law, ‘ice and crystal’ had also been included in the definition of narcotics as previously police had to show seized ‘ice’ as hashish (charas).
The chief of the Special Branch said that his department was submitting ‘regular reports’ about drugs to the Sindh chief minister on his directives as he was personally leading the ongoing anti-narcotics drive.
To a question about involvement of certain policemen in patronising narcotics dens in Karachi, he said ‘actions’ had been taken against those found involved as “some of them were suspended while others were given show-cause notices”.

6,"Pakistan, Bangladesh have much to learn from each other, moot told",Experts discuss future of Islamabad-Dhaka relations at PIIA conference...,"KARACHI: “The independence day of Bangladesh March 26, 1971 and Dec 16 is seen by that country as the day of liberation. In Pakistan around this time the mood is generally sombre with reflection of the past,” said former foreign secretary Riaz Khokhar on Thursday.
He was delivering his keynote address at a conference on ‘50 Years Later: The Future of Pakistan-Bangladesh Relations’ at the Pakistan Institute of International Affairs (PIIA).
“We have to acknowledge that the Bengali leaders made enormous contributions to the making of Pakistan, which was also acknowledged by Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah. The resolution of Pakistan was also moved by A.K. Fazlul Haq. If Jinnah were alive and if he had been asked the worst decisions of Pakistan, he would have said that it was to refuse and deny the results of the 1970 elections along with deploring the action that was taken on March 24, 1971 by West Pakistan,” he said.
The former diplomat said he is often asked about his best assignments during his career to which he has to say from 1986 to 1989 when he served as ambassador of Pakistan to Bangladesh. “It was the best time. I got to meet all leaders, intellectuals, people in the media and civil society. We did discuss serious matters, but objectively and without anger though the differences of 1971 are still there,” he said.
“As a former diplomat, I’m not blaming any political party but every time the Awami League is in power, we have issues. The government under the Awami League has raised serious allegations and questions. They also demand an apology from Pakistan for the atrocities of 1971. But an apology is not that simple. The 1974 documents clearly address deep regret of events and atrocities. Bangladesh demands war reparation, distribution of assets, etc.

Experts discuss future of Islamabad-Dhaka relations at PIIA conference

“While I was the ambassador in Bangladesh, former late prime minister Benazir Bhutto visited Bangladesh in 1989. She had asked for that visit, which the then Bangladesh president Irshad accepted. The issues did come up but such things cannot be decided just like that. Such issues are an impediment to the progress and relations of both countries.
“It is sad that despite sharing the history of 1947, there’s so little interaction with Bangladesh here. The culture of Bangladesh is extremely rich in art, music, dance, etc. Why not have cultural exchanges? Pakistan would be happy to have an exchange programme for students. We can also offer hundreds of scholarships in various fields and Bangladesh, too, can reciprocate,” he said.
‘Let’s resume communication’
“Yes, the impediments are serious but there is no reason why we can’t be talking. There is an absence of debate not at the public and private level or the diplomatic level. But Pakistan and Bangladesh relations do have a future. I appeal, let’s resume communications. We have much to share and much to learn from each other,” he concluded.
Earlier, while reminding the significance of Dec 16, 1971, PIIA’s chairperson Dr Masuma Hasan said that it was when Pakistan was dismembered and Bangladesh formally became an independent and sovereign state. “The date is etched in the minds of millions of people in Pakistan and Bangladesh. History has few parallels to the events of 1971, which led to the second partition of the subcontinent and changed the political landscape of South Asia,” she said.
“In the last 50 years, much water has flown under the bridges of the Indus and Brahmaputra. The global and regional landscape has changed, with a multi-polar world, the phenomenal rise and outreach of China, an assertive India, and the continuing role of the United States. In the regional context, rising from the ashes, Bangladesh has made remarkable economic progress. Whatever the irritants of the past, the people of the two countries share a common historical identity, strive for the same values of democracy, the rule of law, human rights, and freedom of expression. Both countries are members of Saarc and other international organisations and they vote on the same side on many international issues. For the future of Pakistan-Bangladesh relations, there are many positive trends,” she said.
‘We didn’t leave like thieves’
Syed Sikander Mehdi, former Karachi University professor and chairperson of the Department of International Relations, said that the personal memories of West Pakistanis who went to East Pakistan for business and educational purposes are soft. These people still miss Bangladesh. But their memories are not recorded here. “The people from East Pakistan who settled down here before the break-up or after 1971 also have oral memories that have not been published. I did my schooling, college and university education in Dhaka. I was an activist in my student life. I remember us students protesting the Vietnam war, the dictatorship of Ayub Khan. Our family lived in the Bengali area till our migration from Dhaka in late 1972. I had very close relations with my Bengali teachers before and after the military operation. I had a job, my father had a job, too and we had no economic compulsion. When I told my teachers that we were leaving, they hosted a dinner for my family. So we didn’t leave like thieves. But after coming here we saw a headline in the newspaper, which read Bihari na khappay. We cannot wish away the past but we need to write more and talk more about all this,” he said.
Former Professor at the Department of International Relations, University of Dhaka, M Shahiduzzaman said that he was a former student of Sikander Mehdi. “We were sad when he left. Many years later when my students and myself visited the University of Karachi we found him like he has always been, a human being whose soul lies with us,” he said.
Meritorious Professor of International Relations and former Dean, Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Karachi, Dr Moonis Ahmar, observed that Pakistan and Bangladesh relations were seeing a paradigm shift in 1974 with the signing of the agreement in Delhi but then this paradigm shift stopped. 
“We have been moving two steps forward and four steps backward,” he said, while adding that Sheikh Hasina Wajid, the daughter of the man denied premiership here, should be invited over and asked to address a joint session of the Pakistan parliaments. And Pakistani PM Imran Khan can do the same when he visits Bangladesh. 
Ambassador Rafiuzzaman Siddiqui and Dr Raunaq Jahan also spoke.

7,Matters of the soul,"KARACHI: One of the major differences between Eastern and Western cultures, as enunciated by Western scholars, is...","KARACHI: One of the major differences between Eastern and Western cultures, as enunciated by Western scholars, is that the West is known for its material pursuits whereas the East for its spiritual quest. This can be validated from T S Eliot’s iconic poem The Wasteland which basically talks about the spiritual hollowness of Western society. But what does it mean when artists from the Eastern part of the world make the spiritual urge their subject? To find answer to the question a visit to the Art Chowk Gallery where an exhibition of Hira Zubair’s artworks titled Dimensions of Soul is under way.


‘The power of imagination’

 
The artist makes things clear at the outset with her statement, “Sustaining the soil meditates and focuses on our roots. The strength of spirituality involves our capacity to dig deep and find great meanings in life; to align ourselves with a purpose that extends beyond us to find unity within the universe.” 
Now Hira specialises in miniature painting, which implies she has a keen interest in history, particularly the history of the region she belongs to, and has, like all quality artists, finesse in her art. And she emphasises on ‘sustaining the soil’ and ‘focusing on roots’. The point is that in our society there’s a danger of getting rootless, therefore one must stand by what one identifies with. 
In the process putting forward the argument, she comes up with delightful pieces such as ‘The power of imagination’ (gold plated bronze frame, gold leaf, gouache on wasli) and the ‘Growing deeper’ series where history, nature and creativity come together in a seamless manner. To boot, her images, literally and figuratively, speak volumes for the way she has mastered her craft. Hira’s lines are sharp, colours delectable and figures meaningful — hinting at the ‘unity within the universe’. 
The exhibition curated by Humayun Memon concludes on Dec 20.

West SSP Suhai Aziz said that 30-year-old Madiha and her daughter Anam fell down from the building and died.
Quoting witnesses, she added that at first, the child fell and then her mother.
The mother died on the spot while the little girl succumbed to her injuries during treatment at a hospital.
The deceased’s father, Shafiq, as well as neighbours told the police that the couple often quarrelled with each other over domestic issues.
The SSP said the police were investigating the case from different angles and it might be premature at the initial stage to declare it a case of suicide.  
Manghopir SHO Lia­quat Kandhro said the caller who informed Madadgar-15 about the incident claimed that the woman threw her child from the third floor and then she jumped from there.
The bodies were taken to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital to fulfil medico-legal formalities.
Eight held
Police and Rangers on Thursday jointly carried out raids and arrested eight suspects, including five government employees, on allegation of kidnapping a jeweller in Karachi last month.
Speaking at a press conference at a Rangers office in Sultanabad, Colonel Sikander Ali Khan and SSP Anti-Violent Crime Cell Maroof Usman said the held suspects were involved in ‘short-term’ kidnapping.
They said jeweller Hamza was kidnapped by six men in a car and some on a motorbike near Gulshan-i-Maymar Mor on Nov 26. The kidnappers bundled the victim into their vehicle and drove around the city.
Initially, they deman­ded Rs20 million from the father of the jeweller, but subsequently, they red­uced the amount. They were given Rs3.3m for releasing the kidnapped man by the family.  
A joint team of police and Rangers and with the help of ‘modern technology’ traced the Whatsapp call of the kidnappers and arrested eight 
suspects, who were identified as Adnan Akhtar Jan, Hassan Adnan, Zeeshan Qadir, Mohammed Maq­sood, Mohammed Amad, Zohaib Ather, Syed Haris and Umair Mustafa.
Three pistols, a black sedan and one motorbike used in the kidnapping and Rs1,970,000 ransom money were recovered from the kidnappers along with the motorcycle of the victim.  
During the initial inquiry, the suspects revealed that they were also involved in sale and purchase of non-custom paid vehicles. Upon the information obtained from them five such vehicles were also recovered by authorities.
“Most of the held suspects were employees of different government institutions,” said Col Sikander.
They used to take advantage of their official positions to commit crimes, added the officer. 
The AVCC SSP, Maroof Usman, said that the suspects’ criminal records were being checked as they expected more disclosures during the probe.

He said that imposition of governor’s rule was the best option in the province since the PPP government was not allowing centre to work in Sindh and creating hindrances to the federal government’s projects, which had affected development. 
Rahim said at a press conference at a party leader’s residence on Thursday that PPP had claimed to provide Roti, Kapra or Makan to people but people were still waiting for them despite the party ruling over them for the 13 years without break and still continuing. 
He said the federal government provided jobs to people on the basis of merit but in Sindh influential people of the PPP government sold jobs to the highest bidder and still claimed to serve people. It was Sindh government’s duty to control increasing prices of fertilisers in the province, he said.
Rahim said that he would continue to inform people of all issues and problems of Sindh and suggest their solutions. Infrastructure in all towns had crumbled as the local government department had failed to provide basic facilities to people, he said.

11,Vested interests behind conspiracy to reignite ethnic hatred: Khurshid,THATTA: Pakistan Peoples Party’s senior leader Syed Khurshid Ahmed Shah sees hands of vested interests behind...,"THATTA: Pakistan Peoples Party’s senior leader Syed Khurshid Ahmed Shah sees hands of vested interests behind conspiracy to reignite linguistic hatred and revive MQM founder’s ideology in urban centres of the province.
Shah said at a press conference at the residence of a party leader in Makli on Thursday that this country needed a ‘Truth Commission’ to assess performance of all past governments as well as the past one.
The former leader of opposition in National Assembly believed that nation had a right to know the deeds of all ruling parties, including dictatorial regimes right from independence to date. 
He said that Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government had miserably failed to deliver and inflicted unparalleled losses on national economy besides tarnishing the country’s image throughout the world.
Shah regretted that the PTI government had learnt no lesson from two major and unfortunate incidents that took place on Dec 16th. Its unwise foreign and domestic policies had pushed the country to the brink of bankruptcy and earned bad name worldwide, he said.
About persistent water scarcity in Sindh, he contended that the federal government was neglecting smaller federating units, particularly Sindh, and despite repeated demands and reminders by Sindh government it was not ready to release water as per 1990 water accord.
He said that PTI government relied on lies which it kept telling before nation every day. The practice attracted Article 62 and 63 of the constitution, he said, adding this ‘puppet’ prime minister had better resign voluntarily for his unwise policies.
He recalled former governments’ economic performance and said the country was under debt burden of Rs14,000 billion which shot to Rs24,000bn during PML-N government and rose to double its size to Rs41,000bn during current government.
Shah said the opposition was playing a mature role in politics as it never overreacted to harm the country’s image and economy amid critical conditions. He failed to understand how a third world country like Pakistan could be compared with the developed world in terms of its per capita income, he said.
He ruled out midterm elections or premature termination of PTI government and said, however, nothing was predictable in politics and everything was possible in the system.
He said that Pakistan was bound to face shortage of wheat this year and the rates of daily use commodities would also go further up if the PTI government continued to govern this country.
