The development came after the counsel for Mr Qaiser told ECP district monitoring officer for Swabi Sardar Mazhar Hussain during a hearing that the audio clip of his client’s conversation regarding development schemes was recorded before the issuance of the schedule for the Dec 19 LG polls.
The DMO had issued notice to the NA speaker on Dec 11 after the audio clip went viral on social media. In the clip, Mr Qaiser was heard asking the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf leaders and workers in Swabi that tenders of development schemes to the tune of Rs2.5 billion would be soon released as the work orders had already been approved. He also said victory in the tehsil chairman election was of the utmost importance for the ruling party and the defeat would deal a blow to it.
Asad’s counsel Mohammad Ali told the DMO that the conversation, which went viral on social media and was telecast by some TV channels, was an old one and it was not recorded during the ongoing campaign for the local body elections.

Fines provincial minister for attending election meeting in Bajaur

He said his client didn’t violate the code of conduct of the upcoming local body elections in the district and therefore, the notice issued to him should be disposed of without further proceedings.
The DMO accepted his request and disposed of the matter.
Also in the day, Bajaur DMO Fazal Hakeem imposed a fine of Rs30,000 on provincial minister for social welfare Anwar Zeb Khan for violating the election code of conduct.
He had taken notice of the minister attending a meeting of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s workers on Dec 9. The act was against the code of conduct issued for the Dec 19 elections in the district.
The DMP directed the minister to deposit fine by Dec 18 (Saturday) and warned him not to violate the polls code again.
Meanwhile, Bannu DMO Inayatullah Khan Wazir issued the final notice to MNA Zahid Khan Durrani of the opposition Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl for non-depositing Rs50,000 fine imposed on Dec 10 for violating the election code of conduct.
He directed the lawmaker to deposit the fine by Dec 17 (Friday) noon and warned if that didn’t happen, he would refer the matter to the ECP for necessary proceedings against Mr Durrani, including the public office disqualification.
Also in the day, the Tank DMO issued a fresh notice to federal minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Ali Amin Khan Gandapur for allegedly violating the election code of conduct by campaigning for the PTI candidates in the district and directed him to appear before him or send in a lawyer for response on Dec 17.
He warned that if the minister didn’t show up before him on that day, proceedings would be started against him under the Elections Act in his absence.
Earlier, the DMO had issued Mr Gandapur a notice on Dec 14 but he didn’t appear before him.
He also issued notices to MNA Asad Mehmood, who is a son of the JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, and MPA Mahmood Ahmad Khan asking them to appear on Dec 17 (Friday) and explain their respective positions on the alleged violation of election code of conduct by campaigning for their party candidates.
Moreover, Charssada DMO Sahibzada Abbas Bukhari issued notices to local MNA Anwar Taj and MPAs Sultan Mohammad Khan and Khalid Khan of the PTI asking them to appear before him on Dec 17 (Friday) to explain their respective positions regarding the alleged violation of polls code.

5,KP sees slight increase in blood donation this year,Report says lack of awareness main reason for low rate of voluntary blood donation,"PESHAWAR: The people are not ready to donate blood voluntarily due to lack of education and awareness and the myths and misconceptions associated with blood donation, says a health department’s report.
The report compiled by Regional Blood Centre (RBC), Peshawar said that out of the 48,003 blood donations, 43,049 (89.68 per cent) were collected from family replacement donors while 4,954 (10.32 per cent) donations were collected from voluntary blood donors in 2021.
It shows a slight increase when compared to 9.70 per cent voluntary blood donors in 2020.
Out of the total donations collected in the outgoing year, 47,183 (98.30 per cent) were donated by male and only 820 (1.70 per cent) by female donors. This is much lower than the national statistics according to which approximately five per cent of females donate blood. Low blood donation rate among women is a source of concern, although in contrast to 2020, when female donations were only 0.8 per cent.

Report says lack of awareness main reason for low rate of voluntary blood donation 

Out of the total blood donations, 5,888 (12.26 per cent) were collected in RBC while 42,115 (87.74 per cent) were collected at blood camps and collection points. In the previous year, 7.65 per cent units were collected in RBC as compared to 12.26 per cent during 2021. The recruitment and retention of blood donors are a global challenge, says the report.
Blood is a scarce commodity and demand for it is ever increasing. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends that all countries should be self-sufficient in all blood products and that every blood donation should be voluntary, anonymous and non-remunerated.
The collection of blood from voluntary and non-remunerated blood donors is an important indicator of safety and quality.
According to the report, the objective of data collection is to generate credible statistics, compile data and analyse it for improvement in services, policy planning, actionable insights and improved utilisation of the scarce resources.
It said that that during the current year, 48,213 blood donors were attended, out of whom 210 were deferred due to numerous causes. Besides, an additional 208 units of platelet concentrates were collected through aphaeresis mostly to cater the needs of the patients. This is a 2.7 times increase when compared to 2020 when the number of donations collected were 17,793.
The designed capacity of RBC is 50,000 blood donations per year and so far 97 per cent target has been achieved due to the hard work of the staff to sensitise blood donors in the community coupled with increased coordination with the attached hospital blood banks to convert existing family replacement donors into regular voluntary blood donors in line with National Blood Donor Policy, 2011.
The policy calls for sensitisation of university or community-based donor organisations and conversion of family replacement donors into voluntary blood donors.
According to various studies, lack of female-friendly facilities, poor privacy, misconceptions, nutritional status, cultural and social factors contribute to low female donation rates. To understand the existing level of knowledge and awareness regarding blood donation, a nationwide knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) exercise was conducted for blood donors by National Safe Blood Transfusion Programme that identified possible causes of gender discrepancy in blood donations.
The findings suggest a public awareness campaign, which is yet to be launched, to address the issue of female donations as one of the core target areas, among others.
This intervention would strive to reduce prejudices, misconceptions and lower the barriers erected by the gatekeepers of family, community and society for blood donors.
“Unfortunately, voluntary donations are not common in our country. This problem has worsened by the fact that the country has a fragmented demand driven blood system for nearly six decades with a heavy reliance on family replacement donors. However, in times of national crisis, droves of volunteers throng the blood banks for blood donations to save the lives of unknown recipients,” said the study.

7,High court stays closure of two WWB schools in Bannu,Asks board not to shift students to govt schools,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Thursday stayed the closure of two Workers Welfare Board for the children of labourers in Bannu district and directed the board management not to transfer the students to other schools.
A bench consisting of Justice Sahibzada Asadullah and Justice Naeem Anwar issued notice to the WWB management seeking its response to a petition filed by Hafeezullah and several other employees of the two Working Folk Grammar schools for boys and girls against the campus close down orders.
Pir Hameedullah Shah, lawyer for the petitioners, said the board recently notified the shutdown of its two schools in different areas of Bannu district and formed a committee for transferring their assets to itself and adjusting students to the nearby government schools.
He said that the WWB had been closing down its schools on the pretext of implementing a last year judgment of the Supreme Court regarding its schools project.

Asks board not to shift students to govt schools

The counsel contended that the board had been misinterpreting the said judgment of the apex court, which didn’t order it to close down schools, render their employees jobless and shift their students to government schools.
He added that the apex court had ordered the holding of an inquiry into the favouritism during the recruitment of staff members for the schools project so that the officers responsible for the matter should be identified.
The lawyer said instead of fixing that responsibility and taking action against the relevant officers, the board had been closing down schools in the province. 
He pointed out that the curriculum of the Working Folk Grammar schools was different from that of government schools as the textbooks taught there were printed by the Oxford University Press.
The counsel said the students of those schools were the children of labourers and that they should not be punished for the delinquency of any WWB officer.
BAIL GRANTED: A single-member high court bench on Thursday granted bail to a man over Rs25 million worth of bounced bank cheques. Justice Roohul Amin Khan accepted the bail petition of suspect Syed Haris Ali Shah on the condition of furnishing two surety bonds of Rs200,000 each.
An FIR was registered at the Sheikh Maltoon police station on Feb 17, 2021, by a business partner of the petitioner under the Pakistan Penal Code’s Section 489-F (bouncing of bank cheque).
Irfan Yousafzai and Saleem Shah Hoti, the counsel for the petitioner, contended that an offence falling under Section 489-F of the PPC was punishable up to three years imprisonment or fine or both.
They said the offence did not fall in the provision of the Code of Criminal Procedure prohibiting post-arrest bail for certain offences.
The lawyers said investigation in the case had been completed and their client was no further required to the police for probe.
They referred to different judgments of the superior courts and said bail was granted to the accused in similar circumstances.

10,Kohat historical sites need preservation,"KOHAT: People here have demanded preservation and renovation of the historical sites, some of them thousands of ...","KOHAT: People here have demanded preservation and renovation of the historical sites, some of them thousands of years old, which are gradually losing their grandeur due to corrosion, plunder by antiquity smugglers and neglect of the archaeology department. 
Answering a query, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa archaeology department director Dr Abdul Samad, who hails from Kohat, told this correspondent that they could not hire watchmen to stop plundering of the sites unless a museum was constructed as a policy initiative. 
He disclosed that due to this bottleneck the antiques of Kohat had been ignored at the Peshawar Museum. He said that they had their own limitations. 
The sites being ignored for decades include the caves of the Aad-i-Samud dynasty – Raja Aad and Samud who ruled the region 5,000 years ago with their seat five kilometres in the northwest of Kohat in Mian Garhi – which are being robbed by smugglers of Buddha statues, finger rings, coins and old daily-use items. The cave with calcium spikes is also on the verge of destruction. 
The Kohat springs flowing since time immemorial and visited by Guru Nanak and some warriors, the family graveyard of the father of Pakhtuns Ahmed Shah Abdali (Sadozai) known as Durrani Fort at a small hilltop and the 1930 Mir Kheli summer British Dak Bungalow also need attention of the government. 
It is a matter of concern that an old mosque dating back to 1834 in Bahadar Kot had been demolished. 
The people of Kohat have demanded that the lower abandoned portion of the 1905 Khushalgarh rail-and-road steel bridge should be developed for opening food outlets for the tourists to enjoy the mesmerising view of running of the train over the Indus River in the evening. 
Zulfiqar Shah, a historian who penned down a book ‘Kohat in the Mirror of History’, says that by developing the beautiful historical places the district could earn a handsome amount of revenue from the tourism industry.
