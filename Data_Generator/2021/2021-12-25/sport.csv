0,Rahul ready for unique challenges posed by Tests in South Africa,"For all its glorious history, India have never won a Test series in South Africa.","PRETORIA: India vice-captain K.L. Rahul knows all too well the unique challenges batting in South Africa brings but says helping the team to get off to a solid start will be a key ingredient to victory ahead of the first Test in Pretoria on Sunday. 
For all its glorious history, India have never won a Test series in South Africa but after recent successes in Australia and England, Virat Kohli’s top-ranked team are buoyed by their ability to compete on the road in another coronavirus bio-bubble, this time amid the threat of the new omicron variant. 
Rahul concedes South Africa present an altogether different trial though, especially for the batsmen, but believes India are ready. 
“The pace and bounce in the pitches here is very different to every other country,” Rahul told reporters on Friday. “That is why it was important we came here earlier to try to adjust to the conditions. 
“We’ve had a lot of sessions in the middle to create match situations and practiced with a lot of intensity. It has been a great week of preparation. 
“The pitches can be challenging because of the ‘tennis ball’ bounce. When we played in Australia they are fast and bouncy, but here it can be a bit spongy in the first few days and then to starts to quicken up. 
“South Africa is an exciting place to play cricket and comes as a challenge for both batters and bowlers.” 
India did not have an opening stand of more than 30 in their last series in South Africa in 2018, where Rahul averaged only 7.50 in his four innings with a top score of 16. 
“You need to be a lot more focussed and disciplined in your mind here, and be a lot more patient and wait to score your runs,” Rahul said. 
The prospect of making history as the first Indian touring side to win a series in South Africa is a tantalising one for the players. 
“It is a huge series for us as a team,” Rahul added. “We have won in England and Australia, but we have not won a series here and that gives us extra motivation. We need to learn from mistakes in the last tour and do better this time.”

2,Juventus lost their DNA after Ronaldo’s arrival: Buffon,MILAN: Juventus great Gianluigi Buffon said Cristiano Ronaldo’s arrival at the club in 2018 ultimately led to them...,"MILAN: Juventus great Gianluigi Buffon said Cristiano Ronaldo’s arrival at the club in 2018 ultimately led to them losing their  “DNA of being a team”.
Ronaldo, now back at Manchester United for a second spell, scored 101 goals in 135 appearances for Juventus and won Serie A twice but the club did not progress beyond the Champions League quarter-final stage during his three years there.
Buffon returned to his first club Parma in June after nearly two decades at Juventus — he spent the 2018-19 season at Paris St Germain — where he won 10 Serie A titles.
“Juventus had the chance to win the Champions League the first year he arrived, which was the year I was at Paris St Germain, and I couldn’t figure out what happened,” Buffon told American broadcast network TUDN.
“When I returned, I worked with Ronaldo for two years and we did well together, but I think Juventus lost that DNA of being a team.
“We reached the Champions League final in 2017 because we were a side full of experience, but above all we were a single unit and there was this competition for places within the group that was very strong. We lost that with Ronaldo.”
Juventus are fifth in Serie A, 12 points adrift of leaders Inter Milan, and host third-placed Napoli on Jan 6.

3,Covid-19 outbreak claims another Premier League match,LONDON: Burnley’s match at home to Everton on December 26 has become the latest Premier League fixture to be...,"LONDON: Burnley’s match at home to Everton on December 26 has become the latest Premier League fixture to be postponed due to a coronavirus outbreak, it was announced Friday. 
Covid-19 cases within the Everton camp had seen the Merseysiders request a postponement on Thursday. 
But that initial plea was rejected despite Everton manager Rafael Benitez saying he only had nine fit outfield players at his disposal for the fixture on Boxing Day, traditionally one of the busiest days in the English football calendar.
Everton, however, said Friday that the game had been called off, with a club statement saying: “Our Premier League fixture at Burnley on Boxing Day has been postponed due to the number of Covid cases and injuries in our squad.” 
The Premier League added it had taken the “regrettable” decision to postpone the game following a board meeting on Friday. 
“The board reviewed the club’s request today to postpone the match following further injuries to their squad. They concluded that the club will not be able to fulfil their fixture this weekend as a result of an insufficient number of players available to play due to Covid-19 cases and injuries.” 
Both clubs have already had matches postponed this month with Burnley now staring at a fixture pile-up with four games in hand after Boxing Day. 
The East Lancashire club had games against Watford and Aston Villa postponed due to Covid-19 outbreaks while a home clash against Tottenham Hotspur was called off less than two hours before kickoff due to heavy snowfall. 
A total of 13 matches have now been called off in the past two weeks as Britain battles record numbers of positive Covid cases due to the Omicron variant of the virus. 
Benitez said Thursday he was “surprised” that Everton’s game had been expected to go ahead, after two other Boxing Day matches — Liverpool v Leeds United and Wolverhampton Wanderers v Watford — were postponed due to Covid cases. 
Tottenham Hotspur manager Antonio Conte said Thursday’s meeting between the Premier League and all 20 top-flight bosses to discuss the escalating Covid situation affecting English football’s top flight had been a waste of time. 
The virtual meeting was designed to let managers air their concerns over a congested fixture list after Premier League clubs had decided to plough on with the scheduled programme rather than pause the season. 
Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola suggested the only way football authorities would address welfare concerns was if the players went on strike. 
But with industrial action looking highly unlikely, Conte said discussions with the Premier League had been akin to talking to a wall. 
“If I have to be honest, it was a meeting that we tried to speak and some coaches tried to speak, to ask about solutions but I think everything was decided,” Conte said Friday. “I think yesterday [Thursday] it was a wall and for this reason I also prefer to not go into it.” 
The Italian, asked at a news conference if the talks had been a waste of time, replied: “I think so. Because when you have a wall in front of you, you can speak and ask what you want but every decision was (already) taken.” 
Spurs, who have just returned from an enforced two-week break due to a Covid-19 outbreak at the club, are due to host Crystal Palace on Sunday before they visit Southampton on Tuesday. 
Norwich City manager Dean Smith said it was “lunacy” to expect teams to play two matches in 48 hours in the current circumstances, with the relegation-threatened Canaries set to host Arsenal on Sunday before facing Crystal Palace on December 28. 
“We have some fresh cases, but we have got others coming back,” said Smith. “We are not sure how many will miss Boxing Day. 
“It is lunacy that we are having to play two games in 48 hours and there has got to be a question about the integrity of the competition when teams are playing weakened teams against other teams and it is affecting league positions.”

9,Ireland rebound to draw T20 series in US,LAUDERHILL: The United States were unable to repeat their Twenty20 heroics on Thursday night as Ireland fought back...,"LAUDERHILL: The United States were unable to repeat their Twenty20 heroics on Thursday night as Ireland fought back courageously in Florida to draw their series 1-1. 
Monank Patel’s men created history by beating a Test playing nation for the first time on Wednesday and were looking good for more success after a decent bowling display bowled out Ireland for 150 with one ball remaining in the 19th over 
But Lorcan Tucker’s 84 for the Irish and Curtis Campher’s bowling proved decisive for the men in green, who ensured this inaugural Twenty20 series between the sides on American soil ended all square as they edged to victory by nine runs. 
“It was great to get an opportunity to bat that high in the order,” Tucker said. “When its only 150 on the board and a ground with small enough boundaries, you want to take your chances and I think we did that really well in the field. We took wickets at key moments and closed the game out really well.” 
The teams will now play three One-day International matches starting on Sunday in Lauderhill. Ireland then travel to Kingston, Jamaica in January for three one-day games and a Twenty20 match against West Indies. 
Ireland were smarting after losing emphatically in the first Twenty20 match of the series on Wednesday, slumping to a comprehensive, historic 26 run defeat. 
But allied with some excellent bowling and even better fielding, the home side, who opted to send the Irish into bat having won the toss, unleashed another impressive performance which delighted a healthy turn out at the Broward County Stadium even if it ultimately ended in defeat. 
The US catching was superb with almost every chance being held, the best coming when Marty Kain stooped 
low and pulled off a brilliant diving effort to dismiss William McClintock and leave the visitors in deep trouble at 96-6. 
It was proving to be another torrid match for Ireland, who found themselves teetering on 128-8 with three overs left and when US skipper Patel produced an excellent piece of wicket-keeping by running out Barry McCarthy thanks to a classy dive and throw at the stumps, hopes were high of another famous US triumph. 
Yet Tucker, who top scored for Ireland in the first match with an unbeaten 57, was ultimately the match-winner with a fine innings of 84 from 56 balls which included three sixes and helped set what seemed an under-par target of 150.
In reply, the Americans started solidly, recovering from the unfortunate run-out of opener Ryan Scott to reach 34-1 from the first six overs. 
However, Ireland’s bowling was much improved and it wasn’t until Gajanand Singh, who was the American match winner with the bat in the first game, came to the fore again and began to unleash some mighty blows. 
The run-rate however was climbing with Campher the stand-out bowler for Ireland, finishing with four wickets. 
The home team stuck in, but when Singh was trapped LBW by the dangerous Campher, the US were left with too much to do despite the best efforts of Sushant Modani, who smacked 27 from 15 including two maximums before being caught in the deep. 
They needed 17 from the last over but fell just short in an exciting finish. 
Summarised scores: 
IRELAND 150 all out (L.Tucker 84, C.Campher 17, S.Singh 13; S.Netravalkar 3-33) beat UNITED STATES 141-7 (S. Modani 27, M.Patel 26, G.Singh 22; C.Campher 4-25) by nine runs.—

10,Japan will not send government delegation to Beijing Olympics,The decision follows a United States-led diplomatic boycott of the Games over concerns about human rights in China.,"TOKYO: Japan will not send a government delegation to February’s Winter Olympics in Beijing, it said on Friday, a move likely to deepen tension with China. 
The decision follows a United States-led diplomatic boycott of the Games over concerns about human rights in China, although Japan has avoided explicitly labelling its move as such. 
Japan, while a partner of the US, also has strong economic ties to China. 
Tokyo will not send a government delegation to the 2022 Winter Games, but will instead send some officials with direct ties to the Olympics, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told a news briefing. 
These officials include Seiko Hashimoto, head of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee, as well as the heads of the domestic Olympic and Paralympic committees. 
“Japan believes that it’s important for China to ensure freedom, respect for basic human rights and the rule of law, which are universal values of the international community,” Matsuno said. 
Japan was addressing such issues with China directly at various levels he added, saying that this year’s Tokyo Games showed the Olympics and Paralympics were a celebration of peace and sports that give courage to the world. 
“Japan’s government decided on its response to the Beijing Winter Olympics by taking those points into consideration, and deciding on its own,” he said. 
The absence of Japanese officials was not taken under any “specific term” Matsuno said, indicating that the government was not calling the move a boycott. 
In Beijing, a foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, told a regular news conference that China welcomed the Olympic officials and atheletes from Japan. 
China did not send a government delegation to the Tokyo Summer Olympics this year, but only a sports delegation, led by the sports bureau chief. 
Japan has typically taken a softer tone on the issue of human rights in China, reflecting its widespread dependence on China, not only as a manufacturing hub, but as a market for items from automobiles to construction equipment. 
Still, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has faced rising pressure within his ruling Liberal Democratic Party to take a tougher stance on China, public broadcaster NHK said.

11,Harbhajan Singh calls time on career,The feisty 41-year-old brings down the curtain on a 23-year career in the sport.,"NEW DELHI: Veteran India spinner Harbhajan Singh, the first Indian bowler to grab a Test hat-trick, announced his retirement from all forms of cricket on Friday, bringing down the curtain on a 23-year career in the sport. 
The feisty 41-year-old made his international debut in 1998 and played 103 Tests, 236 One-day Internationals and 28 Twenty20 Inter­nationals, taking 711 wickets across the three formats and winning the 2011 ODI World Cup and the 2007 T20I World Cup. 
He last played for India in a T20I in 2016, but has continued to play in the Indian Premier League, turning out for the Kolkata Knight Riders in three matches in the 2021 season. 
The “Turbanator” took the fourth-highest number of Test wickets (417) for an off-spinner behind fellow Indian Ravichandran Ashwin and Sri Lankans Muttiah Muralitharan and Rangana Herath. 
He is also India’s fourth-highest wicket-taker in Test cricket, after Anil Kumble, Kapil Dev and Ashwin. 
“There comes a time in your life when you must take some tough decisions and move ahead,” Harbhajan said in a video message posted on YouTube. 
“I have been meaning to make this announcement for the last few years, but I was waiting for the right moment to share it with all of you. Today, I am retiring from all formats of cricket.”
