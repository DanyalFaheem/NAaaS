The Chief Justice (IHC) passed the remarks while hearing a petition, seeking contempt of court proceedings against the Capital Development Authority (CDA) over construction of Margalla Avenue, which according to the petitioner disturbing national park area.
The petitioner, through his counsel pleaded that despite the court had stayed construction activity in national park area, the CDA is constructing road over there, which is a violation of court order, the petitioner’s lawyer asserted.
The IHC chief justice remarked that if the road is part of the master plan, then its construction could not be stopped, he said and directed CDA to submit its reply by Jan 11.
The 35-km-long Margalla Road is part of Islamabad’s master plan. However, CDA has divided it in three phases.  Under first phase, the road is being constructed from Sangjani area to sector D-12.  While in the second phase, Bhara Kahu bypass will be constructed and in future the road from D-12 to close to Quaid-i-Azam university will be constructed.
Recently environment body objected to the alignment of under construction road, stating that a portion of road falls in the limit of national park area. However, in its response to environment body, CDA has been stating that a small portion of one kilometer falls in national park area, but under zoning regulation of 1992, the CDA could construct the road in the said portion as the master plan was prepared in 1960 and national park in 1979, the civic body said.
The under construction portion of the road will provide an alternative route to motorists coming from G.T. Road, M-I and the airport side. It also provides access to seven residential sectors. CDA officials said that sizeable portion of the road has already been constructed and work is in progress to complete it by June. However, work on Bhara Kahu bypass has not been started as yet and facing delay testing the nerve of thousands of people who faced routine traffic jam on Murree Road near Bhara Kahu.

1,IHC suspends FBR order to deduct tax amount from ICT admin’s accounts,ISLAMABAD: Islamabad High Court (IHC) Chief Justice Athar Minallah on Friday suspended the Federal Board of...,"ISLAMABAD: Islamabad High Court (IHC) Chief Justice Athar Minallah on Friday suspended the Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) notification to the National Bank of Pakistan (NBP), asking it to recover tax from the district administration’s accounts which it had defaulted on.
The capital administration, through Advocate Danyal Hassan, had filed a petition with the IHC against the notice.
The FBR’s regional tax office on Dec 22 had issued a notice to the NBP for recovery of Rs2.38 billion in tax from the accounts of the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT)administration after it failed to pay the dues.
It stated that the administration had defaulted on over Rs2.38 billion in tax.
The notice asked the bank management to “remit or send the money to the commissioner inland revenue, withholding zone, regional tax office, Islamabad, through pay order/demand draft or through banking transfer or cheque for payment to the government, treasury under income tax head of account.”
The FBR warned the bank management that “in case of failure to comply with, the amount shall be recovered from you [the bank]”.
The district administration’s counsel argued that the liabilities had not been determined in accordance with law and the notice was issued without any lawful authority.
He told IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah that if the accounts of the ICT administration were forfeited it would not be able to disburse salaries to its Christian workers on the occasion of Christmas.
Justice Minallah therefore suspended the FBR’s notification for a fortnight and adjourned the hearing.
It may be mentioned that the district administration collects revenue under various heads and a major chunk comes from excise and taxation and sale, purchase and transfer of properties.
In some recent cases, big housing societies and real estate developers deliberately kept the mutation of purchased land incomplete to avoid payment of taxes.
In addition to the incomplete mutation of over 1,200 kanals near Koral since January this year, transfer of 889 kanals in village Phulgaran could not be completed since 2019.
As a result, the additional deputy commissioner (revenue) issued instructions that the patwari of each revenue estate was responsible for collecting taxes and applicable fee at the time of registration of properties or should file a report in case of non-deposit of the fee.

4,"Revenue dept told to recover Rs197m from former PTV chairman, two ex-ministers","Supreme Court in 2018 declared Ataul Haq Qasmi’s appointment illegal, directed recovery of amount paid to him.","ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has directed the revenue department to recover Rs197 million from former ministers Pervaiz Rashid, Ishaq Dar, ex-principal secretary to the prime minister Fawad Hassan Fawad and Ataul Haq Qasmi in connection with the latter’s appointment as the PTV chairman which the apex court declared illegal.
The Supreme Court in November 2018 held as illegal Mr Qasmi’s appointment as the chairman and director of Pakistan Television (PTV).
The verdict not only termed Mr Qasmi’s appointment illegal but also held the appointing authorities — then information minister Pervez Rashid, finance minister Ishaq Dar and Mr Fawad — guilty of making the appointment. It also ordered that Rs197.8m be recovered from them.
The court said 50pc or about Rs98.9m of Rs197.8m would be recovered from Mr Qasmi. 

Supreme Court in 2018 declared Ataul Haq Qasmi’s appointment illegal, directed recovery of amount paid to him

The former ministers would make payments of 20pc each (about Rs19.7m) for ignoring the law while Mr Fawad would pay 10pc or about Rs0.98m for his failure to act in processing the appointment summary which was person-specific.
Kashif Ali Malik, the counsel for Mr Qasmi, contended before IHC Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, who was hearing execution petitions filed by the PTV management, that the apex court had passed the judgment with the direction to recover the amount from the responsible persons and the IHC could initiate the proceeding for the recovery.
A PTV counsel, on the other hand, contended that the apex court in para-35 of the judgement had directed to recover the amount through the Land Revenue Act 1967 and as such this court had not been directed to get the order executed.
The court noted that the apex court had directed PTV to recover the amount from them in the stated ratio as per the procedure in practice for the recovery of dues.
Advocate Malik contended that the IHC can only exercise the jurisdiction in terms of Article 187. 
However, the court noted that SC directions conveyed different meanings as the PTV like any other institution can recover its dues under the law as per Sections 81, 82, 83, 84 of the Land Revenue Act.
Subsequently, the court disposed of the petition with the observations that “all these execution petitions be transmitted to the district collector, ICT, who shall proceed with the recovery of amount as per the directions of apex court by adopting the procedure provided under the law and shall submit report before this court within three months.”

This was pointed out in a statement issued by the All Pakistan CNG Association (APCNGA) on Friday.
The desire of these departments is resulting in production and export losses to the tune of billions, while hundreds of thousands of people are losing their jobs in this era of double-digit inflation, it added.
Because of these factors, agas crisis occurs every winter so much so that it has become a common occurrence even during summer, further putting pressure on the already fragile economy, said group leader of APCNGA Ghiyas Abdullah Paracha.
Due to shortage of gas in the country and mismanagement in gas imports, the country’s economy loses billions while investors receive a negative message, he said, adding despite the government’s desire to liberalise the gas sector, certain elements are not allowing the private sector to start cheap gas imports.
Mr Paracha added that the same elements are obstructing the construction of new terminals, expansion of existing terminals and construction of the gas pipeline, which is badly needed.
He said the gas bureaucracy has failed to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) on time and at reasonable prices and presently expensive gas was being imported to sell cheaply to influential sectors.
Gas supply to the CNG sector has been discontinued as mismanagement in the gas sector has reached its peak, which has severely affected its performance, he highlighted, adding because of rampant mismanagement in the gas sector, circular debt is increasing rapidly resulting in troubles.
Pakistan bought the most expensive LNG cargoes due to wrong planning of officials concerned, the entire burden of which is being shifted to the people, he said, adding summaries of the Ministry of Petroleum have not been approved since the last three years and if a summary is approved by chance, it is not allowed to be implemented. This is destroying the energy sector.

9,Ordinance transferring CDA wings to MCI challenged,"It seems to be an attempt to make authority’s mandate subservient to local govt, counsel argues","ISLAMABAD: The presidential ordinance that has transferred major directorates of the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to the Municipal Corporation of Islamabad (MCI) has been challenged in the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
Through an ordinance, over 40 wings of the CDA are to be transferred to the MCI along with thousands of employees in a period of one year.
The petitioner, CDA Mazdoor Union’s general secretary Chaudhry Mohammad Yaseen, filed the petition through Advocate Kashif Ali Malik. IHC Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani heard the petition.
During the course of hearing, Mr Malik pointed out that the CDA board was reconstituted under an ordinance that had lapsed after completing its constitutional term. Justice Kayani questioned how the board could remain functional after this development.

It seems to be an attempt to make authority’s mandate subservient to local govt, counsel argues

Advocate Malik argued that the recent ordinance provided for transfer of different formations of the civic body to the MCI as it stated: “All wings of the CDA shall be transferred to MCI, except the Chairman Secretariat, Planning Wing and Estate Wing”. As a result, the mandate of the CDA to prepare a master plan under section 11 of the CDA Ordinance, 1960 has been made subservient to the local government of Islamabad.
He recalled that the ordinance laid down charter of the fledgling organisation, defined its jurisdiction, powers, duties, functions and responsibilities, adding that its legislative intent was to establish an independent and autonomous authority, independent in its affairs and administration.
According to the counsel, CDA is vested with certain powers including acquiring of land, undertaking development work and performing revenue functions. Under Section 37 of the ordinance, the authority is empowered to appoint officers, servants, experts or consultants as it may consider necessary for the performance of its functions on terms and conditions as it may deem fit.
The petition stated that the working of CDA comprises of six board members, one each for planning, finance, administration, estate, environment and engineering, and chairman. Furthermore, it added that the business of the authority is distributed among different directorates in the manner given in the CDA Conduct of Business, Regulations, 1985.
The petition stated that after promulgation of the above CDA Amendment Ordinance, 2021 on March 3, the CDA board was constituted and notified accordingly, adding that the president recently promulgated Islamabad Capital Territory Local Government Ordinance, 2021 which is inconsistent with the CDA ordinance and seems to be an attempt at rendering provisions of the latter, ineffective. 
“That impugned Ordinance is also in derogation of and infringes the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution of Pakistan; including but not limited to the violation of Art 4 (Right of individuals to be dealt with in accordance with law), Art 9 Security of Person and Article 14 Inviolability of dignity of man, etc. and Art 25 (equality of citizens)”, the petition added.
It requested the court to set aside the said ordinance.

They expressed resentment over the move and said the cantonment boards was taking action only against private educational institutions and had so far spared commercial outlets, including shops, beauty parlours, boutiques, gyms and private offices. 
It may be noted that the civic body has issued eviction notices to 469 educational institutions and 2,880 commercial outlets in residential areas. 
The cantonment boards in Rawalpindi have so far sealed over 30 educational institutions. 
“My three children are studying in a private school near my house but the school administration told me that they would discontinue their service from January if the Supreme Court rejected their review petition,” said Iqbal Munir, a resident of Allahabad. 
He said he was unable to bear the expenditure of schools in other areas as vans offering pick and drop service charged Rs1,500 per child.  
Mohammad Riaz, a resident of Lalazar, said it was difficult for him to bear school and transport expenditures when inflation was rising. He said private schools in residential areas suited everyone as parents had no difficulty to pick and drop their children there. 
On the other hand, female teachers and school staff are also worried about their future.  
“I have been working with a school as a teacher for over five years. Though I was not getting high salary, the school is located near my house,” said Shaiza Mujtaba of Sarwar Road. 
“If schools are shifted to commercial areas, they would raise their fees. The transport charges will put an extra burden on teachers and staff,” said Irfan Imtiaz, another teacher. 
On the other hand, All Pakistan Private Schools and Colleges Association President Malik Ibrar said they held a meeting with National Assembly members who promised to take up the issue in the parliament.  
“We are trying to approach policymakers to save the future of children, teaching staff and school owners.” 
When contacted, Rawalpindi Cantonment Board (RCB) spokesman Qaiser Mehmood said no action had been taken against private educational institutions in the last two days. However, he said the RCB would implement the court decision and private schools had to shift their outlets form the residential areas.
