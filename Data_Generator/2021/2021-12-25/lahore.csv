0,Opposition will not allow mini-budget: Shehbaz,"“The government’s policy of relying on foreign banks for US dollars is like playing with fire,” he says.","LAHORE: National Assembly opposition leader Shehbaz Sharif says the PTI government is falling back on global commercial banks to avoid depletion of foreign exchange reserves which confirms the concerns and alarm expressed by the opposition.  
“The government’s policy of relying on foreign banks for US dollars is like playing with fire. The opposition will not let the government approve a mini-budget,” he said in a statement on Friday.  
The PML-N president hoped the conscientious members of the government and its allies would take a bold stand to stand by truth. “If the government’s allies join the oppression of the people they will also be seen by the nation as accomplices in destruction of the national economy along with the PTI,” he said.
Shehbaz said that since 2018, the government had reached a debt level of $40 billion which was alarming to say the least.  
“During the first five months of the current financial year, the government borrowed $4.96bn out of which $3.45bn were for non-developmental purposes. Out of the $14bn budget estimate, only $4.699bn have been raised so far,” he said and added debt money could not sustain the economy and nor was it a wise policy in favour of the country.  
“With the entire economy, national defence and government system on debt, the philosophy of geoeconomics will become a joke,” he lambasted.  
“The US dollar is at an all-time high of Rs180.7 and the government is creating more instability by saying the country is running out of dollars,” Shehbaz said.

2,Consumers face gas crisis,Arrival of LNG cargo in January may ease pressure,"LAHORE: Domestic consumers across the province are either experiencing extremely low pressure or no gas at all in peak hours these days. 
The situation may improve if an LNG cargo ordered by the Pakistan LNG Limited is received by Jan 10, Dawn has learned. 
“The Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) wants to provide gas uninterruptedly to domestic consumers,” says an official. “To meet the demand, three LNG cargos are required, but orders for two of the three cargoes were delayed. So, keeping in view the situation, it seems that only one cargo may arrive on Jan 10. And if it is also delayed, the situation may get out of control.”  
According to another official source, the domestic sector’s demand in Punjab alone is 950MMCFD that includes over 500MMCFD of Regasified Liquefied Natural Gas (RLNG) and 450MMCFD of system gas (Indigenous gas). Under the constitution, Punjab is supposed to use the indigenous gas that is surplus of the gas-producing provinces. 

Arrival of LNG cargo in January may ease pressure

“The problem was created by those who failed to import LNG on time to meet consumers’ demand in winter,” he said, adding that the company (SNGPL) recently suspended RLNG supplies to captive power-run export industry and diverted the same to domestic consumers. “And if the domestic consumers’ demand increases, the company may suspend supplies to non-export industries.” 
On the other hand, domestic consumers have been facing extremely low gas pressure or no gas in peak hours across the province. “Most of the time, we have no gas these days,” said a resident of Township. “So, when we have no gas, why we are being served heavy bills.”
The consumers residing in other localities also complained about the severe shortage of gas, low gas pressure, or no gas. 
“The situation has been worst for the last couple of years, as, we have no gas in peak hours (especially after 9pm) in winter,” complained another consumer. 
However, the official dispelled the impression, stating that the problems existed in the tail-end area alone. 
He admitted the fact that most areas were experiencing gas shortages after 9pm. 
“Actually, it’s due to the gas pressure-building activities that are supposed to be carried out by the SNGPL’s teams for normal gas supplies to the consumers,” he clarified.

3,Pindi Ring Road scam resonates in Punjab Assembly,PML-N’s Samiullah Khan alleges the government deliberately delayed answering the question for eight months.,"LAHORE: The Rawalpindi Ring Road project scandal resonated in the Punjab Assembly on Friday as the treasury and opposition members leveled allegations of corruption against each other.
Not satisfied with the answer given to a written query during the Question Hour, PML-N’s Samiullah Khan alleged that the government deliberately delayed answering the question for eight months.
He challenged the authenticity of the details related to the scandal given in the house and said that action was taken only against the bureaucrats involved in the multi-billion rupees scam, while the political figures like federal ministers Ghulam Sarwar Khan and Zulfi Bukhari were given a clean chit.
He also alleged that both the prime minister and Punjab chief minister were aware of the wrongdoings committed in the ring road project and sought details of the meetings presided over by them pertaining to the project.
Parliamentary Secretary Taimur Masood said the prime minister had himself exposed the scandal and naming Imran Khan in the case would be unfair.
He said a transparent inquiry had been conducted into the case registered with the Anti-Corruption Establishment. He vowed to take the case to its logical end.

4,Govt asked to allow LNG imports by private sector,"LAHORE: Blaming the mismanagement on the part of relevant ministers and departments for the ongoing gas crisis, the...","LAHORE: Blaming the mismanagement on the part of relevant ministers and departments for the ongoing gas crisis, the All Pakistan CNG Association has asked the government to immediately allow the private sector to import Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) to meet the growing demand of various sectors.
“Despite the government’s desire of liberalising the gas sector, some elements are not allowing the private sector to start cheap gas imports. This is the only reason behind the gas crisis emerging every year in winter,” the association’s group leader Ghayas Piracha told Dawn on Friday.
“We firmly believe that some departments are ruining the economy in a bid to continue their monopoly over the troubled gas sector. And the desire of these departments is resulting in production and export losses, while hundreds of thousands of people are losing their jobs in this era of double-digit inflation,” he alleged.
Mr Piracha said the association had earlier planned to start LNG imports from August after the government (the then secretary and the minister) gave us a go-ahead in this regard in March. But unfortunately, they were removed from the posts and the matter lingered on again.
After posting of the new minister and the secretary, the association approached them to accord certain approvals in this regard. They worked, enabling the association to start imports and receive its first LNG cargo on Jan 21, 2022.
“But recently, the petroleum secretary was transferred and it, again, delayed the works underway to accord approvals. And if the new secretary, even, quickly removes bottlenecks, we may not be able to receive the first cargo before Feb 10, 2022, since the whole process (approvals, import orders, receipt of cargo, etc) requires at least 45 days,” he explained.
Because of these factors, a gas crisis occurs every winter and now even it has also become a routine during the summer, costing the battered economy dearly, deplored Mr Paracha.
He also accused the SNGPL of delaying getting the agreement (for LNG imports by CNG and other sectors) approved by its board of directors.  
“We request the government to intervene in the matter immediately and enable the private sector including CNG to import LNG to meet the growing demand.”
Earlier in a statement, he said the bureaucracy has also failed to make timely LNG imports at reasonable prices as a result expensive gas is being imported to sell it cheaply to influential sectors.

As Presiding Judge Tahir Sabir resumed the hearing, a lawyer told the court that lead defence counsel Amjad Pervez was not available due to his appearance before the high court. The lawyer sought a short adjournment.
The judge allowed the request and adjourned the hearing till Jan 4 with a direction to both sides to come up with arguments on the point of court’s jurisdiction.
The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) had challenged the court’s jurisdiction to hold trial in the inquiry wherein a challan had also been filed by the agency.
The FIA had booked Shehbaz and his sons Hamza and Suleman in November 2020 under sections 419, 420, 468, 471, 34 and 109 (financial fraud, impersonation and forgery) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and 5(2) and 5(3) (criminal misconduct) of Prevention of Corruption Act and r/w 3/4 of THE Anti Money Laundering Act.

Arabic teachers: The Lahore High Court on Friday sought a report from the Punjab government about the progress on the recruitment of teachers for Arabic language in order to implement teaching of the Holy Quran in schools.  
A division bench headed by Justice Shahid Waheed was hearing an appeal seeking teaching of the Quran in schools.  
An official of the education department told the bench that 7,000 teachers were being given training in the first phase. He said a total of 60,000 Arabic language teachers were required in the province. He said there were financial constraints but the process of appointment of the teachers would start soon.  
The bench adjourned further hearing till Jan 3 and directed the education department to submit a progress report.  
In this case, the bench had earlier directed the sessions judges of all the districts in Punjab to check in their relevant territories whether the Holy Quran was being taught as a separate subject as claimed by the education department.  
The school education department in a report had confirmed that the chief executive officers of the district education authorities visited all the schools (public, private, madressahs) in their respective areas and confirmed that the Holy Quran was being taught in every school as a separate subject.
The judge had ordered that the D&SJs or their nominees would not only check whether Quran was being taught as a separate subject but also counter-verify that the facts narrated by the education department were correct in all respects.

“On Jan 4 (next court hearing in the FIA’s money laundering case against Shehbaz), Khan and Akbar must come to the court with a box of evidence to support the false allegations being peddled for the past three and a half years. The people of Pakistan will find out who is actually on the run,” she said in a statement on Friday.
She said there was no point in responding to anything Mr Akbar said because the adviser, like his “master” Imran Khan, was a “pathological liar” who had been embarrassed by the courts, yet he continued to lie because that’s what he was hired for.
“The PML-N president faced false cases and allegations on a daily basis, now it is Imran Khan and his tout’s turn. Imran had been disgraced for three years with the so-called files of cases against Shehbaz. Imran should also appear in the defamation suit filed by Shehbaz and bring evidence instead of running away,” she said.
She said it had been over a year since the “false” FIR of money laundering was filed against Shehbaz, but so far no evidence had been furnished. Evidence supporting Imran’s allegations against Shehbaz had been missing from day one, she said and added there was no evidence of corruption and corrupt practices in the FIA’s challan.
“Daily Mail and its tout Shahzad ran away from the London court when it came to [presenting] evidence. After the failure of NAB, FIA is being used only to fulfill Imran’s desire for political revenge,” she said.

These days he was working as the chief World Trade Organisation under Industries, Commerce, Investment And Skills Development Department. 
As per the power-sharing formula agreed upon by the PTI and the PML-Q in Punjab, the recommendations of the latter would prevail in the administrative affairs of Gujrat, Mandi Bahauddin, Chakwal, Bahawalpur districts and Daska tehsil of Sialkot district.
