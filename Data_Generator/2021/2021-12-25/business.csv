0,SBP injects another Rs382bn for 63 days,Banks have enough cash to bid for treasury bills in the Dec 29 auction at a lower rate than before.,"KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) injected Rs1.08 trillion into the money market on Friday in yet another open market operation (OMO), which included around Rs382 billion for an unusual 63-day period.
The SBP injected Rs701 billion at 9.82 per cent for seven days in addition to providing  Rs381.75bn at 9.85pc for 63 days through the OMO, which is a tool that the central bank uses to fine-tune interest rates in the short-term by trading government debt securities with commercial banks.
The latest OMO follows the injection of Rs1.77tr a week ago in which the SBP offered money to banks for a unique 63-day tenor for the first time in recent years.
“It can now be safely assumed that the cut-off rate in the next treasury bill auction, due on Dec 29, will significantly be lower than that in the last auction,” Ismail Iqbal Securities Head of Research Fahad Rauf said while speaking to Dawn.
Treasury bills became expensive in the secondary market after the monetary policy announcement in November. In its subsequent monetary policy statement on Dec 14, the SBP called the significant rise in secondary market yields unwarranted while increasing the policy rate by 100 basis points. But the yields stayed at the same level in the next auction of treasury bills held on Dec 15.
“The SBP then introduced the 63-day tenor to reassure the market that the central bank wasn’t going to increase the policy rate in the near term,” said Mr Rauf.
In simple words, the SBP has provided banks with total liquidity of Rs1.07tr through two 63-day OMOs held one week apart. As a result, banks have enough cash to bid for treasury bills in the Dec 29 auction at a lower rate than before. The cut-off yield for three-month treasury bills in the Dec 15 auction was 10.78pc.
“We expect the cut-off rate for the three-month paper to go down about 50 basis points to 10.25pc,” he said, adding that the drop in the six-month paper is likely to be 75-100 basis points from the preceding auction.
“We expect heavier participation in the three-month paper since more liquidity is available under the 63-day OMO,” said Mr Rauf.

1,Hammad Azhar blames legal hitch for inability to meet domestic gas need,Says costly LNG won’t help govt to ensure proper supply to domestic consumers.,"• Says costly LNG won’t help govt to ensure proper supply to domestic consumers
• SSGC chief hopes half of gas shortfall in Karachi to be covered if other sectors support      
ISLAMABAD: Federal Minister for Energy Hammad Azhar has said that domestic consumers’ gas needs in winter are met by curtailing supply to non-export general industries and captive power plants, but this year the Sindh High Court (SHC) issued a stay order on the curtailment.  
Speaking at the PTV on Friday, the minister said since the next hearing regarding the stay order was scheduled for Dec 30, he had directed the Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) to request the court for an early hearing and plead against the stay order so that needs of the domestic consumers could be met in an efficient manner.  
He said there were some complaints of low gas pressure at the tail end of the transmission network, but there were certain reasons for shortage of the commodity supply to domestic consumers in Karachi. He told the media that Sui Southern and Northern Gas companies had been making all-out efforts to ensure good management of gas supply to domestic consumers despite serious constraints such as depletion of existing natural gas reserves and high demand in the peak winter season.  
He was of the opinion that gas demand of domestic consumers had increased by 3 to 5 per cent in the winter season, which was met by curtailing the supply to other sectors as per the priority list set by the cabinet due to shortage of the commodity.  
About the existing natural gas reserves, the minister said they were depleting by at the rate of nine percent every year. During the past two years, the gas reserves had depleted by 18pc, he added. Besides, the demand had increased manifold, he said. In this situation, adding the imported, costly Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) did not suit the government to supply to domestic consumers.  
“The government gets only Rs1 billion from domestic consumers in return if an LNG cargo of Rs8bn to Rs10bn is injected into the system to supply the commodity to domestic consumers.”  
The minister said the next hearing before the SHC regarding the stay order was scheduled for December 30 and expressed the hope that the court would set aside the stay order and grant the permission to curtail the supply to the general industry and captive power plants to meet needs of the domestic consumers. 
While sharing ground realities of the prevailing gas supply issue through a video message, SSGC Managing Director Imran Maniar said the domestic consumers had the highest priority for the gas supply according to official load management plan and the gas utility was making all-out efforts to mitigate their sufferings. 
Referring to the press conference by the minister, Mr Maniar shed light on the reasons of gas shortage in Karachi. He explained all possible steps being taken to resolve the issues of customers in Karachi and how gas supply would be maintained / improved for the metropolis. 
250MMCFD shortfall expected
Mr Maniar said domestic customers had the highest priority in government’s gas load management plan. Currently, the shortfall was 200 million cubic feet a day (MMCFD) but it was expected to rise to 250MMCFD in January 2022, he said. In this scenario, the SSGC was putting its best efforts to route the gas, which was earlier being supplied to other sectors, to its domestic customers by curtailing gas supplies to CNG sector along with the non-export industrial sector and its captive power plants.  
Just two days back, a plan had been discussed with industries to limit the curtailment of gas supply to the non-export industrial sector through a mandatory shutdown of 36 hours a week in order to ensure building good pressure of gas. “We expect the industry to honour this agreement and support SSGC in these difficult times,” the MD said. 
According to him, this plan will be executed from December 27 and it is expected that between 70 and 80MMCFD gas will be available this way. Through this initiative, he said, 50 per cent of the “150MMCFD gas shortfall currently being experienced by Karachi customers” could be covered.  
The MD requested the industrial customers to comply with this understanding and not to take stay orders from honourable courts; rather they should sit together with the SSGC to discuss possible solutions for solving this prevailing issue.

2,"Urea price down to Rs1,768 a bag, govt body told",Meeting reviews supply-chain situation and production trajectory of fertiliser plants.,"ISLAMABAD: The weekly fertiliser review meeting on Friday noted that punitive measures undertaken against hoarders and profiteers had resulted in significant reduction in urea price close to notified rate of Rs1,768 per bag. 
The provincial departments informed the meeting presided over by Minister for Industries and Production Khusro Bakhtyar about punitive steps undertaken against hoarders and profiteers, said a press release. 
The committee noted that not only adequate fertiliser stocks were available to meet the requirements of Rabi season, but its price has also declined significantly. 
Adviser to the Prime Minister on Commerce and Trade Abdul Razak Dawood, officials of the fertiliser industry, provincial departments and the petroleum division also attended the meeting. 
The meeting reviewed the supply-chain situation and production trajectory of fertiliser plants. 
Representatives of the Fertiliser Manufacturers of Pakistan Advisory Council -- a collective forum of all the fertiliser manufacturers in Pakistan -- informed the meeting that the output of plants has been increased, and up to 20,000 tonnes of urea was being produced daily. 
Mr Bakhtyar asked the industry to increase urea supplies by 30 per cent i.e. about 3,000-5,000 tonnes countrywide to ease down the market.  He said Fatima Fertiliser based in Sindh and Agri Tech units would be made operational in full capacity by January and February next year.

3,Gepco fined Rs21m for fatal incidents,Regulator says it received reports about 13 deaths in different electrocution incidents.,"ISLAMABAD: The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Friday imposed Rs21 million fine on the Gujranwala Electric Power Company (Gepco) on a charge of negligence, resulting in fatal incidents from July 2019 to May 2021. 
The regulator said in a statement that it received reports about 13 deaths in different electrocution incidents during this period.  
It constituted a two-member committee under Section 27A of the Nepra Act, 1997, which visited the relevant areas, conducted investigation and ascertained the facts and identified possible violations of laws, rules and regulations. 
The committee’s report revealed that eight out of 13 fatalities occurred due to Gepco’s negligence. The deaths included one Gepco employee and seven people from the general public. 
Therefore, the regulator issued a show-cause notice to Gepco on September 2, 2021, under Section 27B of the Nepra Act, 1997, and later provided an opportunity of hearing to the Gepco management on October 13. 
Based on the evidence available on record, submissions of Gepco and relevant provisions of the laws, rules and regulations, Nepra concluded that Gepco had failed to discharge its statutory obligations to maintain safety standards as laid down in the relevant laws, code and manual. 
The regulator noted that Gepco had given a compensation of Rs4m to the family of its employee who lost his life in electrocution, but gave no compensation to the heirs of seven deceased persons from the general public. 
Therefore, Nepra directed Gepco to compensate the families of the deceased from the general public equal to the amount given to the heirs of its deceased employee i.e Rs4m and share with it documentary evidence of payment. The authority has also directed Gepco to provide a job to the next of kin of each of the deceased family. 
In another statement, Nepra said its Indicative Generation Capacity Expansion Plan approved in September this year envisaged a significant policy shift from dependence on ‘dirty and imported’ fuels to ‘clean and indigenous’ resources. 
It said the plan required a total capacity addition of 32,477MW in the country over the next 10 years. Out of this, 11,203 MW of the capacity will be based on power plants driven by Solar and Wind Energy, including 7,533 MW (23.2pc of the total) of Solar projects and 3,670 MW (11.3pc) of Wind Power Projects. 
Another 13,445 MW (41.4pc) capacity will be based on hydropower -- another renewable source of low-emission electricity -- besides the critical role these facilities play in irrigation, flood control and water supply. Bagasse-based power plants are expected to contribute 491 MW (1.5pc) to the planned generation mix. 
The K-3 Nuclear Power Plant accounts for 1,145 MW (3.5pc) of the envisioned capacity addition which was also a unique source of electrical energy that does not release greenhouse gases into the environment. Finally, 1,000 MW (3.1pc) of electricity is set to be imported under the CASA-1000 project. This electricity is also based on clean hydropower.

4,FBR claims 11pc growth in collection from sugar sector,The bureau linked this increase to the introduction of the track-and-trace system (TTS) in November.,"ISLAMABAD: The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) on Friday claimed that revenue collection from the sugar sector posted growth of 11 per cent from Rs29.3 billion a year ago to Rs32.43bn in the first six months of this year. 
The bureau linked this increase to the introduction of the track-and-trace system (TTS) in November disregarding the impact of the increased prices of the commodity on the revenue. The price of sugar is still over Rs100 per kilogram across the country. 
An official announcement from the FBR claimed the “encouraging outcome” of the digital monitoring of the sugar sector showed that the TTS was contributing significantly to the prevention of revenue loss and resulting in increased profits. 
The TTS equipment was installed in October and November, and all sugar mills were delivered the paraphernalia along with tax stamps to be affixed on each sugar bag. The FBR had through a sales tax general order notified that no bag of sugar would be allowed to leave a production site or a manufacturing facility without affixation of the stamps and Unique Identification Marking (UIM). 
Prime Minister Imran Khan had formally inaugurated the TTS for the sugar sector on Nov 23. The Inland Revenue Enforcement Network (IREN) was entrusted with the task to combat tax evasion in the sugar sector in order to ensure enforcement of movement of sugar bags with tax stamps. Regional enforcement hubs across Pakistan were tasked with conducting raids on the unstamped/non-tax paid sugar. 
As a result, all IREN hubs intensified their operations against the supply chain operators to ensure implementation of the TTS in letter and spirit. 
Subsequently, the Hyderabad Directorate of Intelligence and Investigation (Inland Revenue) visited various sugar dealers in the city on Nov 27 and found a stock of 172 sugar bags manufactured by M/s Chamber Sugar Mills lying on the premises of M/s Gulzar and Co without tax stamps. The bags were seized by an IREN team, which created deterrence in the market. 
Since then, more than 65 raids have been conducted by regional IREN hubs of Rawalpindi, Lahore, Faisalabad, Multan, Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, Quetta and Peshawar in various cities and towns across the country, but no sugar bags were found without tax stamps. 
The FBR initiated implementation of the TTS in September from the tobacco sector immediately after the vacation of a stay by the Sindh High Court on Aug 20. Keeping in view the approaching crushing season, the bureau decided to implement the system in the sugar sector in order to digitally monitor production by the entire industry. 
Site surveys/factory visits were completed by a third party private licencee of the FBR in September and tripartite agreements signed with all the 79 operational sugar mills of Punjab, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in October resulting in 100pc coverage of the sector.

6,Inflation to ease by middle of next year: AHL,AHL expects the policy rate to increase from the current 9.75 per cent to 10pc by June.,"KARACHI: Arif Habib Ltd (AHL), which is the investment banking arm of the eponymous industrial conglomerate, said on Friday it expects inflation will be back in single digits in the second half of the next calendar year because of the high base effect, currency stabilisation, monetary easing and a slowdown in global commodity prices.
Speaking to the press at the launch of a report titled “Pakistan Investment Strategy 2022,” Arif Habib Ltd CEO Shahid Ali Habib said the inflation outlook depends on the pace of domestic demand, fuel and electricity rates besides global commodity prices.
“As the year progresses, we expect aggregate supply (is) likely to catch up with demand and bottlenecks in global commodities and other goods markets (will) be resolved,” he said, adding that commodities prices are likely to “moderately slow down” in the middle of 2022 with a pick-up in supplies.
AHL expects the policy rate to increase from the current 9.75 per cent to 10pc by June. With inflationary pressures likely to subside in the second half of 2022, the benchmark interest rate will decline and close the calendar year at 9.25pc, he said.
The brokerage house expects the country’s external account will remain under pressure in the near term and recover in the second half of 2022. “Despite challenges on the external front, the current account deficit is expected to be fully financed from external inflows and the foreign exchange reserves are expected to remain at adequate levels through the rest of the fiscal year,” he said.
As for the fiscal side, he said the revenue collection is expected to improve with the government intending to eliminate certain tax exemptions while curtailing current and development expenditures.
“Over the next few quarters, our base-case foreign exchange outlook is less pessimistic than initially feared. We expect the rupee to reach Rs178 by June and Rs183 by December,” he said, adding that the Financial Action Task Force is likely to upgrade Pakistan’s status from the grey list to the white list by the end of 2022.
Stock market forecast
Mr Habib said he expects the KSE-100 index to reach 55,000 points by the end of the next calendar year, an upside of roughly 25pc.
“Our forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple for 2022 comes out to 4.9, which is lower than the last 10-year P/E of 8.3... earnings growth is expected to clock in at 12.4pc,” he said.
Mr Habib said he foresees an increase of 12.4pc in the earnings of the constituent companies of the KSE-100 in 2022. The estimate is based on a likely jump of 18.3pc in banks’ earnings and a 29.8pc increase in the profits of energy exploration and production companies.
Given the swings in the market during the last six years, the index underwent a broad sell-off worth $2.3bn from foreign investors. Foreign ownership as a percentage of free-float market capitalisation dropped to a 10-year low of around $2bn, he said, noting that the number will further come down to $500 million after excluding the foreign strategic holding.
“We believe the recent (MSCI) reclassification to the frontier from the emerging market is likely to regain the attention of foreign participants,” he said.
