1,JCP to debate Justice Ayesha Malik’s elevation to Supreme Court on Jan 6,PBC’s vice chairman expresses reservation and concern on what he called an attempt to violate seniority principle.,"ISLAMABAD: The Judicial Com­mis­sion of Pakistan (JCP) will meet on Jan 6 to complete an unfinished agenda as Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Gulzar Ahmed has proposed once again the name of Justice Ayesha A. Malik of the Lahore High Court for elevation as a judge of the Supreme Court, an informed source confided to Dawn on Friday.
A lack of consensus during an extended meeting on Sept 9 had forced the JCP to reject the elevation of Justice Malik — the fourth most senior judge of the LHC — to enter the Supreme Court as the first-ever woman judge in the country’s judicial history.
Reacting swiftly, the Pakistan Bar Council’s (PBC) Vice chairman expressed reservations and concern over the move to what he called an attempt to violate the seniority principle for elevation of judges to the Supreme Court and the high courts.
In a statement, Khush Dil Khan emphasised that it was a consistent stance of the legal fraternity that judges should be elevated on the basis of seniority in all the courts and that the practice to “pick and choose” should stop.
Khush Dil Khan was of the view that if the seniority principle was violated for elevation to the apex court, the high courts and lower courts, as well as the legal fraternity, would resist it forcefully.
Four members of the eight-member JCP had opposed the proposal to elevate Justice Ayesha Malik when it met on Sept 9, while an equal number supported it. 
Justice Maqbool Baqar, Justice Sardar Tariq Masood, former judge Dost Mohammad Khan and a representative of the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC), Akhtar Hussain, had opposed the idea whereas the CJP, Justice Umar Ata Bandial, Federal Law Minister Barrister Dr Farogh Naseem and Attorney General (AGP) Khalid Jawed Khan had favoured Justice Malik. 
Justice Qazi Faez Isa — another JCP member — was unable to take part in the proceedings as he was out of the country.
While the JCP was holding its session on Sept 9, lawyers had arranged a protest and convention in a nearby office of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA). They accused the judiciary of favouritism in the appointment of superior court judges and thus harming its image.
Through a resolution, the convention asked the JCP to adhere to the seniority principle in appointments to the apex court from the provincial high courts until such time as fair, transparent and objective criteria for appointment of judges at all levels were framed in consultation with all stakeholders and appropriate amendments to the Judicial Commission Rules.
But during the JCP meeting on Sept 9, Chief Justice Gulzar Ahmed had described the event as a historic day when a woman judge had been nominated to the apex court.
Justice Umar Ata Bandial observed that the legal fraternity had to progress and decide whether “we had the courage and strength to take a step in favour of a woman”, emphasising that a uniform standard be applied for men and women for selection. “The woman judge cannot be stopped on the basis of seniority or lack of it if she meets the standards of competence or capacity or independence.”
Justice Bandial said the nominee (Justice Malik) was known to be fiercely independent and probably that was the reason why the Bar was opposing her elevation and stalling the process.
Justice Sardar Tariq Masood, also a member of the JCP, observed that whenever the seniority principle was ignored for the appointment of judges, the judiciary’s independence stood compromised and its fallout derailed democracy.
Justice Masood, who had opposed the appointment of Justice Malik, said it was unfortunate that “without valid reasons”, the three judges of the LHC senior to Justice Ayesha Malik were being ignored.

Dr Awan urged both the opposition and the treasury to make a joint effort to improve the penal laws of the country so that culprits behind such heinous crimes could be punished in time. 
He said that the Sri Lankan manager’s lynching and burning of his body has bowed the head of the entire nation in shame. “This incident has brought a bad name to the country in the entire world,” he said. 
He requested NA Deputy Speaker Qasim Suri, who was presiding over the session, to suspend the agenda of the day and confine proceedings of the house only to the Sialkot tragedy.

3,Maulana Fazlur Rehman lauds establishment for ‘keeping aloof’ from KP local govt polls,JUI-F has grabbed the highest number of mayor and chairman seats in the polls for 39 tehsils of KP.,"KARACHI: After years of confrontation with it, the chief of the opposition Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) alliance Maulana Fazlur Rahman on Friday came up with “appreciation” for the military establishment, saying its recent role had led to fair local government elections in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’ where his party Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) has grabbed the highest number of mayor and chairman seats in the polls for 39 tehsils of the province.   
In a confident tone, the Maulana admitted his “serious complaints” against the military establishment in the past but in the same breath appreciated its role for staying detached from the recent electoral process unlike 2018 general elections.  
“Let me explain one thing and it’s very crucial,” he said while talking to reporters after chairing a meeting of the PDM Sindh chapter which was called to review arrangements for its planned march to Islamabad against price hike in the country on March 23.  
The Maulana sounded eager to make a point of what he said after a brief pause.  
“We had serious complaints against the establishment in the past. Everyone knows this fact. But this time we have witnessed no interference from the establishment in the local bodies’ elections of KP. We appreciate this [strategy]. Since there’s no interference, you have seen the results. This [results of KPK general bodies’ elections] is the true reflection of the people’s opinion. It’s not like the one which we had seen in the 2018 general elections when an artificial impression was presented as public opinion.”  
He termed the results of KP LG elections an “encouraging beginning” and was confident that the trend would sustain.
“The credit for this achievement goes to the PDM. Our workers and support from the people. It’s just a beginning and we hope that this [movement] would end with the same results,” he said, vowing that the coming march to Islamabad of the opposition parties would lead to end of “unjust and incompetent government” of Prime Minister Imran Khan.  
The Maulana nominated Allama Rashid Mahmood Soomro as chairman of the committee for the PDM’s Sindh chapter to supervise the arrangements for the March 23 march to Islamabad.  
“In today’s meeting we discussed all possibilities and timelines for our preparation with representation from all parties in the PDM. The Pakistan Day reminds us of our commitment to our country and our march to Islamabad would manifest that commitment and our loyalty with the country,” said the PDM chief.

Speaking at a rally staged by BNP-M workers and leaders in the Sarona area of Khuzdar district on Friday, Mr Mengal said his party would continue its struggle for the rights of the people of Balochistan. 
He said it was General Ayub Khan’s dictatorship and later the so-called democracy, which always made attempts to spread fear and panic among the people just to rule over them. 
The BNP-M chief said that some elements had been trying to pit the people in Wadh against each other and they had started such efforts during the first martial law, but failed. 
He said: “We are not against development, but believe in practical work and not just in lip service.”

6,Pakistan for accountability in Afghanistan,Such accountability must take into account all the crimes committed by anybody in Afghanistan over the last two decades: envoy.,"UNITED NATIONS:  Pakistan supports a comprehensive and equitable accountability in Afghanistan, says the country’s envoy to the United Nations, which recently adopted a resolution to allow humanitarian and financial assistance to Kabul.
Although the UN Security Council (UNSC) unanimously adopted the resolution moved by the United States, some council members suggested holding the Taliban responsible for the current situation in Afghanistan. The UNSC resolution also cautioned that the assistance sent to Afghanistan must not benefit individuals and entities sanctioned by the United Nations. Several Taliban leaders are on the sanction list.
When asked at his latest news briefing if Pakistan supports the demand for acc­ountability, Ambassador Munir Akram said: “There have obviously been violations of human rights and criminal beha­vior, but we must see that this accountability is comprehensive and equitable.”
Such an accountability, he said, must “take into account all the crimes committed by anybody in Afghanistan over the last two decades”.
“So that is at least our approach. We don’t know whether the process will start or not. But if it does start, we hope that it will be equitable and comprehensive.”
The UNSC resolution does not call for accountability, but it does remind the Taliban of their responsibilities as the de facto rulers of Afghanistan.
The United Nations does not recognise the Taliban government and earlier this month, the UN General Assembly delayed a decision on who will represent Afghanistan at the world body.
At Ambassador Akram’s news briefing, a journalist noted that the Taliban had greatly restricted the freedom of the Afghan women and therefore could not be trusted with protecting the rights of all Afghan citizens.
Mr Akram acknowledged that the Taliban “have not fully satisfied the international community as yet,” but said that “the steps they have taken are in the right direction”.
He urged the international community to stay engaged with Afghanistan and help its current rulers in bringing peace and stability to the war-ravaged country.
