According to tracking website Flightaware.com at 1540 GMT on Friday, a total of 2,118 flights had been cancelled worldwide, including 500 flights originating from or headed to US airports, and over 5,700 delayed.
Pilots, flights attendants and other staff have been calling in sick or having to quarantine after exposure to Covid, forcing Lufthansa, Delta, United Airlines and many other airlines to cancel flights.
According to Flightaware, United cancelled more than 170 flights on Friday, or nine per cent of those that were scheduled.
“The nationwide spike in Omicron cases this week has had a direct impact on our flight crews and the people who run our operation,” United said in a statement.
“As a result, we’ve unfortunately had to cancel some flights and are notifying impacted customers in advance 
of them coming to the airport,” the airline said, adding that it was working to rebook passengers as quickly as possible.
Similarly, Delta cancelled over 145 flights, saying it has “exhausted all options and resources — including rerouting and substitutions of aircraft and crews to cover scheduled flying.” 
“We apologise to our customers for the delay in their holiday travel plans,” the company said.
More than 10 Alaska Airlines flights were axed, after employees said they were potentially exposed to Covid-19 had to self-isolate in quarantine.
The cancellations added to the pandemic frustration for many Americans who were eager to reunite with their families over the holidays, after last year’s Christmas was severely curtailed.

The latest maritime tragedy to hit the impoverished low-lying nation saw a fire burn through the three-storey vessel in the early hours while passengers slept on board.
As light broke, rescue workers combed through the still-smoking and charred remains of the vessel, removing dead bodies wrapped in white plastic as distraught relatives waited on the muddy riverbank for news. “I have just found the body of my mother-in-law. 
She jumped in the river and died of drowning. I don’t know what happened to my wife and children,” said Mohammad Russell from the riverbank near Jhalkathi, 250 kilometres south of Dhaka.
“I searched the hospital. My wife and children weren’t there. I hope they survived by jumping into the river. Oh, Allah, save them,” he said.
Mohammad Ismail, 48, said that he threw his mother overboard into the “very cold” river and dragged her to the shore, but when he returned on a fishing boat his wife and daughter were nowhere to be seen.
“I saw a person burning in flames,” he said by phone. “My other daughter survived after someone threw her in the river.” 
“My father, me, my six-month-old nephew and my sister were travelling together. When the fire broke, I gave the baby to a man. He was trying to save the baby. But now we cannot find them,” one woman survivor said.
Witnesses said the blaze originated in the engine room, which may already have been on fire when the vessel left Dhaka late on Thursday.
It had a licence to carry 420 people but survivors said it was overcrowded.
One official estimated that up to 700 passengers were on board when it left Dhaka. “We were sleeping on a mat on the ground floor deck. All the passengers were sleeping. My nine-year-old grandson, Nayeem, was with me, he jumped into the river. I don’t know what happened to him,” said an elderly grandmother.
Local police chief Moinul Islam said that with an unknown number of people having jumped overboard, the death toll may rise further.
“We have sent some 100 people with burn injuries to hospitals in Barisal,” Islam said.
“The fire went on for four or five hours before it was doused. The entire [ferry] has been gutted. But they managed to bring it to the shore,” local district administrator Johar Ali said. 
“It is a new ship. It was constructed in 2019 and it has its fitness cleared until 2022,” Golam Sadek, head of Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority, said. Experts in the South Asian nation of 170 million people blame poor maintenance, lax safety standards at shipyards and overcrowding for the all-too-frequent such tragedies.
In August, at least 21 people were killed when a boat packed with passengers and a sand-laden cargo ship collided. In April and May, 54 were killed in two separate accidents.
Fires are also a regular occurrence. In July, 52 people perished in a blaze in a food factory in an industrial town outside Dhaka. In February 2019, 70 died in another blaze.

2,Delhi probes event calling for mass killing of Muslims,NEW DELHI: Indian police said on Friday they have launched an investigation into an event where Hindu hardliners...,"NEW DELHI: Indian police said on Friday they have launched an investigation into an event where Hindu hardliners called for mass killings of minority Muslims.
A speaker at the gathering earlier this month told the crowd that people should not worry about going to jail for killing Muslims. 
“Even if just a hundred of us become soldiers and kill two million of them, we will be victorious... If you 
stand with this attitude only then will you able to protect sanatana dharma (an absolute form of Hinduism),” the woman said.
The meeting in the northern holy city of Haridwar was attended by at least one member of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
The party stands accused of — but denies — encouraging the persecution of Muslims and other minorities by hard-line Hindu nationalists since coming to power in 2014.
Prominent Muslim MP Asaduddin Owaisi tweeted that the comments in the video were a “clear case of incitement to genocide”.
Modi’s government has not commented on the event.
The woman in the video reportedly added that Indians should “pray to Nathuram Godse”, the Hindu extremist who assassinated Indian independence icon Mahatma Gandhi in 1948.
‘Cleansing’ 
Another delegate, Prabodhanand Giri — the head of a fringe Hindu group who is often photographed with senior BJP members — called for a “cleansing” and for those present to be “ready to die or kill”.
“Like Myanmar, the police, politicians, the army and every Hindu in India must pick up weapons and do this cleansing. There is no other option left,” he is heard to say.
A military crackdown in Myanmar on the heavily persecuted Muslim Rohingya minority is thought to have killed thousands and has forced huge numbers to flee.
A third speaker is heard to say that he wished he had killed Modi’s predecessor, the main opposition Congress party’s Manmohan Singh, who was the first Sikh Prime minister of India.
Another said he had asked hotels from his state not to allow Christmas celebrations. The statement was met with cheers from the audience.
The BJP denies accusations that its agenda is to turn officially secular and pluralistic India into a pure Hindu nation.
Many in the Muslim community say they have been increasingly subject to attacks and threats since Modi, a lifelong member of a hard-line Hindu group, came to power. 
Christians have also been subject to violence and harassment, with the BJP government in the southern state of Karnataka this week becoming the latest to introduce legislation outlawing “forceful” religious conversions.
Police in Uttarakhand state, where the controversial gathering took place, told AFP they are “investigating the matter and strict action will be taken against the guilty.” 
Michael Kugelman from the Wilson Center hit out at the Indian government over its silence. “...not a peep, much less a condemnation, from the gov’t. Sad truth is that this deafening silence isn’t the least bit surprising,” he tweeted Thursday.

3,Iran diplomats get Saudi visas for OIC posts,The countries have held several rounds of talks since April aimed at improving relations.,"TEHRAN: Three Iranian diplomats have received visas from rival Saudi Arabia allowing them to take up posts at the headquarters of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Jeddah, officials said Friday.
Shia-majority Iran and the Sunni Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, both members of the pan-Islamic body, have held several rounds of talks since April aimed at improving relations. In 2016, the kingdom’s execution of revered Shia cleric Nimr al-Nimr saw protesters attack Saudi diplomatic missions in Iran. Riyadh responded at the time by cutting ties with Tehran, while OIC foreign ministers condemned the violence.
Riyadh and Tehran support opposite sides in several conflict zones across the region, but Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and officials in Saudi Arabia confirmed visas had been approved for the diplomats.
“Saudi Arabia has agreed to grant visas to three Iranian diplomats as part of a routine procedure for representatives of a member state of the OIC,” a Saudi foreign ministry official said Friday.

4,South Korea’s former president Park Geun-hye gets pardon,She was impeached and ousted after a graft scandal sparked huge street protests.,"SEOUL: South Korea’s ex-president Park Geun-hye received a pardon on Friday, cutting short a jail term of more than 20 years for corruption with her successor saying he granted it in the interest of national unity.
Park became South Korea’s first woman president in 2013, but less than four years later she was impeached and ousted after a graft scandal sparked huge street protests.
The 69-year-old was serving a 20-year prison sentence for bribery and abuse of power, with another two years after that for election law violations.
“We must overcome the pain of the past and move forward into the new era,” said President Moon Jae-in, who was propelled into power in 2017 following public backlash against Park and her conservative party.
“Considering the many challenges we face, national unity and humble inclusiveness are more urgent than anything else.” 
Moon said Park’s deteriorating health after serving almost five years in jail was also a factor in the decision to pardon her.
Park has been hospitalised several times this year. She is currently receiving treatment at a facility in the capital Seoul.
The amnesty will take effect on Dec 31, the justice ministry said.
“I express my deep gratitude to President Moon Jae-in and the government authorities who decided to grant amnesty despite many difficulties,” Park said through an aide, according to the Yonhap news agency.
Her corruption scandal exposed shady links between big businesses and politics in South Korea, with Park and her close friend Choi Soon-sil accused of taking bribes from conglomerates, including Samsung Electronics, in exchange for preferential treatment.
The amnesty decision marked a shift in Moon’s position from January, when at the end of her trial process, she became eligible for a pardon from the president.
His office had said at the time that it was a “historical lesson” that a former president had committed acts that led to a prison sentence. “This should never happen again.” 
Dramatic fall
The scandal marked a dramatic fall for Park, who grew up in the political spotlight and enjoyed a pampered life as the eldest daughter of Park Chung-hee — a dictator who ruled South Korea for nearly two decades until his assassination in 1979.
It shattered the image she had tried to create, of an incorruptible conservative icon who was beholden to none. In addition to her prison sentence, Park was also hit with hefty fines.

5,World’s first ‘dual-mode vehicle’  to be launched in Japan today,"“This (DMV) can reach the locals (as a bus), and carry them onto the railway as well,” says CEO.","TOKYO: It’s a bus, it’s a train, it’s a DMV! The world’s first dual-mode vehicle, equally at home on road and rail, is set to make its public debut on Saturday in the town of Kaiyo in Japan’s Tokushima prefecture.
The DMV looks like a minibus and runs on normal rubber tyres on the road. But when it arrives at an interchange, steel wheels descend from the vehicle’s underbelly onto the rail track, effectively turning it into a train carriage.
The train wheels lift the front tyres off the track while the rear wheels stay down to propel the DMV onto the railway.
The CEO of Asa Coast Railway company, which operates the DMVs, said the vehicles could help small towns like Kaiyo with an ageing and shrinking population, where local transport companies struggle to make a profit. “This (DMV) can reach the locals (as a bus), and carry them onto the railway as well,” CEO Shigeki Miura told Reuters on Friday. “Especially in rural areas with an ageing population, we expect it to be a very good form of public transport.” 
The DMV can carry up to 21 passengers and runs at a speed of 60km/h on rail tracks and can go as fast as around 100km/h on public roads, Asa Coast Railway said.
Powered by diesel fuel, the small fleet of vehicles, which come in different colours, will run along part of the coast of Shikoku island in southern Japan, connecting several small towns and offering passengers attractive seaside scenery.
Miura said he hoped the project would encourage railway fans from around Japan to visit.
