0,Border spat with Taliban resolved: official,Says talks with TTP continuing and effort being made to reach settlement.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Afghan Taliban authorities have overcome the recent row over border fencing by agreeing that further fencing would be done through consensus, a senior official said on Friday.  
The official, who spoke to a group of journalists on the background, said: “It has been decided at a senior level that fencing-related issues would in future be dealt with through mutual agreement.”  
The official, however, did not exactly specify at which level the talks between Pakistan and de facto Afghan government were held after Wednesday’s incident in which Taliban fighters disrupted border fencing and took away spools of barbed wire. The fighters had then also warned Pakistani soldiers against resuming fencing.  
The incident led to a tense situation in the area where it occurred. Defence ministries of the two sides later held talks on the issue. Taliban ministry of border and tribal affairs also reportedly took part in the parleys.  

Says talks with TTP continuing and effort being made to reach settlement 

The official said Taliban Defence Minister Mullah Yaqoob visited the area on Wednesday and defused the situation. “The dispute has been quietly and calmly settled,” he maintained.  
Pakistan has been fencing the 2600-kilometer-long border with Afghanistan since 2017 to end terrorist infiltration and smuggling despite very intense opposition from Afghanistan. Besides erection of fence, the project also includes the construction of border posts and forts, and raising of new wings of Frontier Corps, the paramilitary force that guards the border.  
The official said 90 per cent of the fencing had been completed. A large part of the fence has been constructed in inhospitable terrain and in some places at very high altitudes. The fencing is expected to be completed at a cost of about $500 million.  
Fencing has been a contentious issue in Pakistan-Afghanistan ties because the Afghans dispute the border demarcation done during the colonial period. Pakistan, however, insists that the line separating the two countries, also called Durand Line, is the valid international border.  
The differences over the status of the border have been so intense that they have in the past resulted in several fatal clashes between the troops of the two countries. Moreover, Pakistani construction teams installing the fence have on a number of occasions endured cross-border attacks by terrorists.  
Islamabad had always hoped that Afghan Taliban would help in settling the longstanding matter. However, that has not been the case. Taliban did not resolve the issue when they were in control of Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 and have not done anything substantive to address it this time either so far.  
Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid, who is currently the acting culture and information minister, had in an interview days after the takeover of Kabul by the group in August, rejected the fencing of the border by Pakistan. “The Afghans are unhappy and oppose the fencing. … The fencing has separated people and divided families,” he had said.  
The official at the background briefing downplayed Taliban’s opposition to the fencing project. “Fence is a reality. Nearly 90 per cent of it has been installed. Not agreeing with it is not an option,” he emphasised.  
Talks with TTP
Responding to a question about talks with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which were being held in Afghanistan through Afghan Taliban’s facilitation, the official said the dialogue is still continuing despite TTP’s announcement about not extending the ceasefire.  
“The talks are continuing and an effort is being made to reach a settlement. There are differences over TTP’s demand for release of prisoners. The dialogue has, however, not reached a dead end,” he maintained.  
The TTP had on December 9 refused to extend the month-long ceasefire that started after accusing Pakistani authorities of not fulfilling their commitments. The ceasefire had begun on November 9 after initial progress in talks and it had largely held. The TTP resumed attacks soon after ending the truce.  
The official sounded a bit disappointed with the Afghan Taliban on the TTP issue. “They have always asserted that they would not allow the use of Afghan soil against Pakistan, but practically we have seen no action,” he regretted.

• Special panel to decide award of tickets
• Fawad asks opposition for alternative to finance bill     
ISLAMABAD: Just a few days after the shocking defeat of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) in the local government elections in its stronghold of Khy­ber Pakhtunkhwa, Prime Minister Imran Khan on Friday dissolved the party’s organisational structure across the country. 
During a meeting with senior PTI leaders, Prime Minister Khan constituted a 21-member committee to form a new structure of the party organisations.  
“The prime minister dissolved Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s all organisations from Centre to tehsil level across the country after consultation with the senior leadership of the party,” announced Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry at a press conference. 
He said all the office-bearers of the PTI’s organisational setup had been removed from their posts. 
The minister said the meeting had decided that a special committee would be formed to look into the matter of giving tickets to relatives of PTI leaders and in future such cases would not be decided at the local level, rather they would be sent to the committee for a final decision. 
Mr Chaudhry said KP Chief Minister Mahmood Khan had been given responsibility for the second phase of local bodies elections in KP and a ticketing mechanism for the elections would be set up, with the approval of the prime minister. 
The decision on tickets for local government elections in Punjab would come to a committee comprising PTI’s senior members, he said, adding that the committee would decide the candidates at the central level so that no issues such as resentment come up at the local level. 
The minister said the meeting discussed KP’s LG elections and the general situation of the country. He said: “A 21-member constitutional committee comprising the national PTI leadership had been formed which was working on the new constitution of the party.”  
The committee comprises Pervez Khattak, Mahmood Khan, Murad Saeed, Asad Qaiser, Ali Amin Gandapur from KP, and Fawad Chaudhry, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Hammad Azhar, Khusro Bakhtiar, Chaudhry Mohammad Sarwar, Saifullah Niazee, Amir Kayani and Sardar Usman Buzdar from Punjab. 
Mir Jan Mohammad Jamali and Qasim Suri would represent Balochistan while Imran Ismail and Ali Zaidi from Sindh and Asad Umar from the federal capital were part of the committee. 
Mr Chaudhry said after the approval of the committee comprising senior members, new organizations of the PTI would be constituted. 
A day after the first phase of LG polls in the KP in which Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) clinched top slots, Prime Minister Khan had expressed displeasure and grilled KP Chief Minister Mehmood Khan on the party’s defeat. 
Mr Khan had blamed selection of wrong candidates for the defeat in the first phase of the local government elections in KP province. “Selection of wrong candidate, was a major cause, however, in the second phase of LG polls, PTI would bounce back with strength,” he had announced. He also had claimed that he would himself monitor all LG polls to be held in the country in future. 
Mr Chaudhry told the presser that the PTI was still the largest political party in Pakistan whereas Mr Khan was the leader of the federation and his vote bank was present everywhere from Gwadar to Khyber and from Karachi to Lahore. “No party other than the PTI is capable of fielding candidates for 1,100 to 1,200 seats of the national and provincial assemblies in the general elections. The PPP is now the party of Sindh whereas the PML-N is confined to Punjab only,” he added. 
“As members of PTI, we have to fulfill the responsibilities of the federation diligently considering them as national responsibilities,” he maintained. 
If PTI’s politics was affected, it would affect the politics of Pakistan badly, he believed. 
The minister told the media that Prime Minister Khan had expressed dissatisfaction over the PTI performance in the first phase of local body elections in the KP.  
He said there was no concept of family politics in his party as Mr Khan never allowed personal relationships to dominate in his political career. “If the culture of PPP and PML-N comes to the PTI, there will be no difference between them and us,” he remarked. 
The minister said Mr Khan expressed displeasure over the distribution of party tickets against which many complaints had been received. The way the PTI should have played its role as a major party was not witnessed in the KP’s local body elections, he added. 
‘Not a personal bill of PTI’
Replying to a question, Mr Chaudhry said the finance bill was “not a personal bill of the PTI” and if the opposition did not want to go to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, they should come up with an alternative solution. 
He reminded that billions of dollars had been borrowed by the past regimes of the PPP and PML-N which had to be paid back by the present government. “If they have any alternative proposal or agenda, they should bring it in the parliament,” the minister suggested to the opposition parties.

3,Process to use EVMs on right track: ECP,Official warns against meddling in the affairs of the ECP and attempting to pressurise it.,"ISLAMABAD: Days after an official of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) said he was not sure whether the electronic voting machines (EVMs) would be used in the next general elections, the ECP clarified that it was not neglecting its duties on deploying voting machines during the polls. 
In a statement issued on Friday, the ECP spokesman said the commission had been working on putting into use technology even before legislation was carried out on EVMs, adding that after the law was passed, it formed three committees, which were performing their tasks and had apprised the ECP of their work. 
The statement said procurement of EVMs involved many steps, including designing of scope of work for automation of electoral processes, finalisation of general requirement and specifications, preparation of technical specifications as per international standards, identification of required function, features and business process flows to handle EVM- preparation of vendor and platform Neutral Request for Proposal (RFP). 
It further said that the commission also had to consider selection of the best evaluated bids, award of contract, manufacturing of EVMs, setting up of testing and certification labs and engaging third party consultants. 
The spokesperson said arrangements also had to be made for customised and secure warehouses to store EVMs (200,000 to 350,000 sft), safe and secure transportation of voting machines, hiring of technical human resource for managing EVMs, configuration and deployment of machines, training of staff and poll day support and maintenance. 
He said the ECP was ensuring that tendering was not vendor specific and a third party testing was carried out to ascertain if the machines could be used for conducting free and fair elections. 
He said certain individuals having no clarity on EVMs were making baseless statements which amounted to misleading people, civil society and media, and warned against meddling in the affairs of the ECP and attempting to pressurise it. 
He reiterated that the commission would continue discharging its constitutional and legal responsibilities.

4,"How can a convict become PM, wonders PM Imran",Expresses surprise over reports on Nawaz Sharif’s return.,"• Expresses surprise over reports on Nawaz’s return
• Ceremony held to mark approval of over Rs100bn house loans
ISLAMABAD: Expressing surprise over media reports that self-exiled former prime minister Nawaz Sharif is returning home as his (Nawaz’s) conviction could be withdrawn, Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Friday: “How can a convicted person become prime minister of the country for a fourth time?”  
Mr Khan was talking to a group of ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf leaders to discuss political developments in the country.  
When contacted, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said the prime minister was surprised as to how a convicted man (Nawaz) could return to the country to become prime minister for the fourth time.  
Mr Chaudhry said the prime minister also wondered how the Supreme Court, after disqualifying a person (Nawaz), could allow him to contest election.  
Interestingly, former National Assembly speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq said in a statement on Friday that he was going to London to take Nawaz Sharif back to the country.  
The information minister quoted the prime minister as saying Mr Sharif had failed to give money trail of their assets to the courts.  
Meanwhile, Minister of State for Information Farrukh Habib said in a tweet that the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) had submitted a challan in a court in the corruption case involving Rs16 billion kept in the accounts operated in the names of certain employees of Ramzan Sugar Mills.  
Mr Habib said after submission of the challan by the FIA, PML-N leader Shehbaz Sharif had started hiding behind adjournments.   

 



 
House building loans
Speaking a ceremony marking the approval of over Rs100bn housing loans by private banks under Mera Pakistan Mera Ghar Scheme, Prime Minister Khan said the government’s scheme of subsidised loans for house construction would not only help the low-income group to own a house but also boost the national economy through enhanced construction activity.  
“This is a great moment for Pakistan because we are heading on the path which we should have opted way earlier,” he said.  
The prime minister lauded the banks for mending their attitude towards the common man who otherwise used to consider himself an alien in the westernised atmosphere of banks.  
The PM said the government was not only extending housing loan facilities to the low-income group but had also introduced single national curriculum to provide quality education to their children.   
Citing the success of the Chinese model, he said China had steered its 700 million people out of poverty by uplifting its low-income group. Mr Khan said by adopting that approach, Pakistan — with a 220 million population — should have been a very strong country and powerful economy. “No country with a very low ratio of people with buying power can excel,” he added.  
The prime minister said it was pleasing that the banks had approved over a Rs100bn loans for the low-income group and hoped that more people could be attracted if the scheme was properly marketed citing its ease and incentives.  
He said as another incentive, the government had introduced a subsidy on the housing loan which he promised to increase with the improvement of economic situation.  
Earlier, the prime minister distributed house keys among the beneficiaries of the loan scheme and shields among three private banks which have showed impressive performance during the process.  
Finance Adviser Shaukat Tarin said in the past the banks never extended loans to the low-income group but the current volume of Rs260bn loan applications and approval of over Rs100bn loans manifested a remarkable change.  
He said if it desired to take the mortgage ratio to 10pc, the country should provide around Rs5.5 trillion loan within 10 years. He said the target of loans equaling 1-1.5pc of GDP a year would lead the country to development.  
Chairman of the Naya Pakistan Housing and Development Authority retd Lt Gen Anwar Ali Hyder appreciated the approval and disbursement rate of the housing loans.  
He said six months ago, there was no concept of providing housing loans to the low-income group as no one ever paid attention to this segment of the society.  
State Bank Governor Raza Baqir told the gathering that loans of Rs109bn had been approved while the banks had so far disbursed Rs32bn as housing loans among the applicants. He said on average, the banks were approving Rs4.2bn loans and disbursing Rs1.7bn a week.  
Saarc secretary general
In a meeting with Secretary General of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc), Esala Ruwan Weerakoon, Prime Minister Khan said Saarc could provide a conducive and beneficial atmosphere to build economic synergies, transforming the quality of life of people in South Asia.  
He reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to the mutually beneficial goals and objectives embodied in the Saarc Charter.  
As the SAARC secretary general hails from Sri Lanka, the prime minister strongly condemned the Sialkot incident and expressed condolence on the death of Priyantha Kumara who was tortured to death by a mob.  
He said there was no justification whatsoever for such acts and all necessary steps had been taken to speedily bring the perpetrators of this crime to justice.  
He emphasised strengthening cooperation on issues of common interest, including climate change, education, poverty alleviation, energy integration, and health challenges.  
He expressed the hope that Pakistan would host Saarc summit when “artificial obstacles” created in its way would be removed.  
The secretary general thanked the prime minister for his guidance on Saarc-related issues and assured him that he would make determined efforts to strengthen the collaboration among member states in different fields for the benefit of all South Asian countries.  
Hiking trail restored
The prime minister said in a tweet: “Under our vision of promoting Eco tourism the historic Monroe hiking trail has been restored in KP. Under our 10billionTreeTsunami - traversing 50 km of pristine natural forest with two overnight camping sites.”
