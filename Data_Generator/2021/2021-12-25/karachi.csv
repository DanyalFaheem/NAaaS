0,Sindh govt hands over KMC-run cardio hospital to NICVD,Murtaza Wahab inaugurates chest pain unit at KIHD.,"KARACHI: The Sindh government-run National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD) took a major step to make the Karachi Institute of Heart Diseases (KIHD) one of its satellite centres when it opened a chest pain unit on its premises on Friday.
The move was in line with the last month’s announcement by Karachi Administrator Murtaza Wahab, who had said that the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation-run KIHD would start functioning as a satellite centre of the NICVD from Dec 25.
However, almost all opposition parties, including the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan, Jamaat-i-Islami, Pak Sarzameen Party, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, had opposed the plan and termed it an attempt by the Pakistan Peoples Party government to snatch health facilities of the KMC. They had vowed to use all legal and democratic means against the move.

Murtaza Wahab inaugurates chest pain unit at KIHD

The provincial government has already taken back the health and education functions from the local government organisations under the Sindh Local Government (Amendment) Act 2021.
Speaking to Dawn, an official of the NICVD said that it’s the first step to take over the KIHD. “The KIHD doesn’t have an outpatient department for children. The government plan is to provide all heart-related facilities to patients free of cost.”
Wahab inaugurates new unit
The inaugural ceremony of the chest pain unit was performed by Administrator Wahab, who is also the spokesperson for the provincial government and chief minister’s law adviser.
At the ceremony, Mr Wahab said: “I had a dream that KIHD in Federal B. Area becomes a centre for NICVD so that residents of districts Central and East could also be provided modern cardiac care facilities near their area of residence, free of cost.”
He appreciated services of NICVD and said it was a flagship programme of the Sindh government through which state-of-the-art healthcare facilities were being extended to the entire province, including the remotest areas such as Mithi and Tharparkar.
“Now people from not only entire Pakistan, including Balochistan, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Kashmir, but also from abroad are arriving at the NICVD Karachi and Sukkur to avail top of the line cardiac-care facilities,” he claimed.
Sharing the health facility’s progress in recent years, NICVD Executive Director Prof Nadeem Qamar said over 675,604 patients had been examined at chest pain units over the last five years. Of them, 246,228 were cardiac patients and 14,331 people had heart attacks, whose lives were saved in time by providing them proper medication.
17th facility in Karachi
He said that the chest pain unit at the KIHD was 17th facility of the NICVD in Karachi. He said one each unit had been set up in Tando Bago, Ghotki, Jacobabad, Umerkot and Tando Allahyar. “The units are functional and providing state-of-the-art cardiac care and treatment to patients at their doorstep totally free of cost.”
“When a patient comes to our health facility, we ensure that each patient gets the required treatment. This is the most successful healthcare programme across the world, which has saved countless lives and helped thousands of people to live a healthy life,” he said. 
The NICVD, he said, in collaboration with the Sindh government was providing free-of-cost quality care at its satellite centres and chest pain units in the province. 
“From a hospital, NICVD has been transformed into a large network in a short span of five years. Today, it has 10 fully fledged hospitals and 22 chest pain units in the province,” he said. 
Prof Riffat Sultana, the KIHD executive director, Dr Zair Hussain heading emergency services at NICVD, senior cardiologists and local government representatives also attended the event.

1,‘PTI man standing against land-grabbers’ gunned down,Police have started gathering evidence to find out the exact motive and people behind the deadly attack.,"KARACHI: Assailants shot dead a 46-year-old man and wounded his friend in Quaidabad on Friday, police said.
The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf claimed that the victim was a party worker and he was getting death threats for putting up resistance to ‘land mafia’ over its plans to occupy a graveyard land in Landhi to build a commercial project.
The police believed that the killing of Haider Swati was a result of some ‘property dispute’. But, they didn’t clarify the dispute between the victim and the land-grabbers continuing for the past few months.
“Two men on a motorbike intercepted a car carrying two people near Murghi Khana bus stop in the second half of the day,” said an official at the Shah Latif Town police station.
“They fired multiple shots and sped away. The driver of the car died on the spot while his aide 52-year-old Umar Zada, who was sitting beside him, suffered serious bullet wounds. Both were taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) where the wounded was said to be out of danger,” the official said.
He said the victim was a resident of Landhi and going to meet a common friend with the wounded man when they came under the attack.
The police had registered a case against unidentified suspects and started gathering evidence to find out the exact motive and people behind the deadly attack.
Minutes after the incident, PTI leaders and workers reached the JPMC and home of the victim where they condemned the incident and criticised the police for their failure in providing security to a man, who was “already under a threat”.
“There’s a graveyard in a residential area of Landhi,” PTI MPA Saeed Afridi told the media. “For the past few months, there was a move from land and builder mafia to encroach upon the land of the graveyard. The area people have serious reservations and Haider had led the community against the move. He had been getting threats and the area police knew this. We want a thorough investigation and arrest of the killers at the earliest.”

2,Christmas festivities in full swing in Karachi,"City’s Christian community has decorated houses with Christmas trees, displayed big stars in neighbourhoods.","KARACHI: With the country is still reeling from fears of the coronavirus pandemic, the Christian community hope to celebrate Christmas on Saturday (today) with a ‘somewhat’ sense of freedom after two years of confining their celebrations indoors.
“For the last two years there have been problems with regard to worship. We were asked not to physically come to the church to attend Christmas mass,” says Sheryl D’Souza, a Goan Christian woman.
As part of the national policy to control the spread of Covid-19, churches had been strictly following the guidelines issued by the government to ensure safe distance and a complete lockdown of public activities.

City’s Christian community has decorated houses with Christmas trees, displayed big stars in neighbourhoods 

Like the churches in the rest of the country, the management of the St. Patrick’s Cathedral had stopped holding the routine masses as well as those on the special occasions like Christmas and Easter for around two years.
With the lockdown no longer in place, the Christian community believes that this year they would be able to hold and enjoy the celebrations in the absence of stricter restrictions.
“We are hearing about the outbreak of a new variant called Omicron, but since there is no lockdown-like situation in the city, we hope we can enjoy the celebrations amid necessary precautions,” says 41-year-old Sheryl, who is buying traditional Goan eatables for Christmas.

Shopping spree
Her young daughter, Ashita D’Souza, has bought new clothes and shoes to wear on Christmas Day.
The markets, mostly in the downtown Saddar, are bustling with life as families are out on a shopping spree. Children and women as well as youngsters are seen buying gifts and other items at shops.
As the metropolis is supposed to experience a cold wave in the last week of this month, the winter clothing of different styles and designs and bright colours are in fashion.
During the evening hours, families head to the markets mostly located in Saddar or close to their localities.
Similarly, shops selling colourful glass bangles and henna are also the focus of women.
But, Christmas preparations are not just limited to buying personal belongings. It’s beyond that.
Decorating houses is also considered as important as buying personal belongings.
People are buying Christmas trees, mostly artificial ones, decorated with lights, stockings, buntings, etc.
Since there is no specific species of the tree to be decorated on this annual religious eve, those who chose to have the original one either buy the conifer or cypress. But, of course, this is going to be a hectic exercise of visiting the nurseries to find the trees.
Children are also busy buying gifts to be exchanged with their cousins or friends on the day.
Also, buying Santa Claus dresses is an important part of the shopping.
Traditional food
Bakeries are all set to sell special cakes on the occasion of Christmas. It has become a tradition to either serve the guests with cake or exchange cakes on the eve.
In the surroundings of Empress Market, where mostly the Goan Christians live, the traditional food is ready to be sold at specific shops. Amchem Goa is one such shop located in a street where many arms’ shops are located.
“Sorpotel is a beef curry dish, which is a must on the eve of Christmas at every Goan’s house,” Sheryl told Dawn, as she buys eatables at the Amchem Goa shop along with her young daughter.
“But, cooking sorpotel is not an easy task”, she says, adding: “It takes almost a month to prepare meat and other items to be used in it.”
“This is so tough that I cannot cook the sorpotel at home,” she says, smilingly. “That’s why we have come here to buy it.”
There is a list of the eatables hanging in the shop.
It includes traditional sweets and food including kulkul, chana dosa, Benica, Neuris, Bolinas, Batica, fruit cake, Cheese Straws, Vorahs, roast beef and chorics mas.
The aging saleswoman, who is also a Goan Christian, says it is becoming difficult these days to cook the food since there was a shortage of natural gas in winter.
Decorating the neighbourhoods The largest St. Patrick’s Cathedral has been decorated with a big star hanging above the iron gates.
Big stars have also been displayed in the streets of the Christians’ localities.
Other neighbourhoods including Essa Nagri, Azam Basti, Akhtar Colony, Pahar Ganj, Drigh Road and others are also witnessing the same hustle and bustle of shopping-goers.
A number of Christians, who hail from Punjab, are leaving the metropolis to celebrate Christmas with their families in their cities.
A visit to the Cantonment Railway Station revealed that seats in all the trains running between Sindh and Punjab have already been reserved in advance.
“There is not a single available seat in any of the trains because of Christmas,” a ticket-seller told Dawn. “The seats will be available from Dec 30,” he repeatedly told the crowd.
Some passengers complained that while the Pakistan Railways runs special additional trains on the occasions of of Eidul Fitr and Eidul Azha, they should also run additional trains on the eves of Christmas and Easter.
Many said they preferred trains to travel because flights as well as buses were getting behind their scheduled time due to fog or smog in the upcountry.

3,"Body to regulate groundwater extraction, KWSB tells court",KARACHI: The Karachi Water and Sewerage Board has informed the Sindh High Court that a licensing committee has been...,"KARACHI: The Karachi Water and Sewerage Board has informed the Sindh High Court that a licensing committee has been constituted to review, regulate and monitor the business of subsoil water in the metropolis.
The KWSB in its comments, filed in response to a petition against extraction of subsoil water for commercial purposes, submitted that the committee was recently constituted in pursuance of an order of the Supreme Court issued in December 2018.
Without providing further details, the water utility maintained that in the light of the apex court’s order the Sindh government had issued a notification in September this year after which the KWSB constituted the subsoil water licensing committee vide an order dated Nov 16 to deal with all matters relating to subsoil water for industrial/commercial use.
A two-judge bench headed by Justice Aftab Ahmed Gorar took the statement of the KWSB on record and again issued notices to some private respondents running the businesses of subsoil water for Feb 7.
Over 30 petitioners filed a petition before the SHC stating that extraction of subsoil water for commercial purposes and its supply through waterlines and tankers without obtaining a licence in term of Subsoil Water (Extraction and Consumption) Regulation 2018 were being made in different parts of provincial metropolis.
They further submitted that instead of taking any action against the persons involved in illegal extraction of subsoil water, the KWSB and other official respondents were issuing permissions and no-objection certificates for road cutting to lay subsoil water pipelines and supply of illegally extracted water.
They argued that the extraction of subsoil water and its supply through pipelines to industries was in violation of the apex court’s order that had directed the government to regulate and price the groundwater be it industrial or agriculture use.
Referring to a judgement of the SHC handed down in January this year, the petitioners said the court had held that if the extraction of subsoil water in huge quantity was allowed the same will certainly disturb aquifer and environment of the area concerned. They sought directives for competent authorities to look into the gravity of the situation and take appropriate action.
They pleaded to declare extraction of subsoil water for commercial purposes without obtaining a licence illegal, all NOCs/permissions issued by the respondents in contravention of law be declared unlawful and also sought restraining order against private respondents from extracting subsoil water for commercial purposes and official respondents to take strict action against extraction and supply of such water for commercial purposes.

The incident came as a grim reminder of the killing of 18 people in a similar blast in the Shershah area.
“The blast occurred in a sewerage line at Parsi Gate due to accumulation of gases,” said Inspector Ejaz Pathan, the SHO of the Mahmoodabad police station. 
“A motorcycle mechanic shop situated on the sewerage line also collapsed. Three people suffered minor injuries and they were shifted to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for treatment. A bomb disposal team was also summoned and an investigation was under way,” he said.
A health official said the injured were identified as Muhammad Bilal, 17, Dilawar, 20, and John, 11. All of them worked at the mechanic’s shop.
The injured, he said, suffered wounds due to fall of concrete structure with the force of the explosion. “They were released from hospital after initial treatment,” he added.

5,Google pays tribute to Moin Akhtar,"The legendary artist was born on Dec 24, 1950","KARACHI: He brought smiles to people’s faces. He did dozens of characters, perhaps more than that, in just one show to prove what a versatile actor he was. He gave the art of improvisation a distinct flavour that elevated the quality of the scripts, which he would be asked to follow as an actor, a couple of notches. He was, of course, none other than Moin Akhtar — the artiste who passed away in 2011 of a heart attack at the age of 61.
Friday, Dec 24, was Akhtar’s 71st birth anniversary. To pay tribute to him Google celebrated his life with a nice little doodle. Describing his contribution to his chosen field of work, the website wrote, “A champion of everyday people, Akhtar is widely regarded as one of Pakistan’s greatest comedic actors. He was born in Karachi, Pakistan on this day in 1950. He began his stage career at 16 years old and quickly became known for his masterful impersonations and side-splitting skits. After a breakout 1966 appearance on a popular Pakistani talk show, Akhtar became a household name.”

The legendary artist was born on Dec 24, 1950 

It’s a fair description, although one is not sure he was that young when he first appeared on the showbiz horizon. Still, what he went on to achieve — by starting out as a stand-up, then graduating into a top-drawer actor and a variety show host who to date has no parallels — is astounding. In his mid-fifties, he was already one of the most influential artistes of the country.
Visually, Google’s doodle is spot-on in quite a few ways. First up, it shows Akhtar in a suit, something that he was very particular about. He was a well-dressed, cultured man. In his regular, away-from-showbiz, life he spoke eloquently in Urdu. He can also be seen, in the image, having a firm grip on the microphone. He was meticulous about voice projection. Finally, his gaze typifies the confidence that he exuded when he interacted with his guests or interviewees.
An apt doodle!

Fashionably attired in kurta, pyjama and brightly-coloured waistcoats, most rally participants were riding motorbikes while several were using four-wheelers and other modes of transport to reach their destination. 
During their way to Mazar-i-Quaid, the rally participants, including women and children, made several brief stopovers at different points where the organisers addressed the participants and chanted slogans. 
Among others, the rally was also attended and addressed by senior politician Dr Farooq Sattar, MPA Muhammad Hussain of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan, MNA Dr Aamir Liaquat Hussain of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) and Dr Saleem Haider of the Mohajir Ittehad Tehreek.
Addressing the rally, Dr Sattar said that a unity among Mohajirs was the need of the hour. 
“We know our strength. We know our expertise. The people who call us minority are in fact those who are living in s state of denial. But they also admit the talent, merit and honesty of this community. And these are our strength,” he said. 
Zohaib Azam, one of the organisers of the event, said that the need of the hour was to disassociate or detach political affiliations from the word Mohajir and celebrate the community’s culture like any other cultural celebration that took place in the country. 
Hassan Khan, another organiser, said that the event had been organised by the young ones belonging to the middleclass segment of society and those who belong to working class. “It has nothing to do with any political party, nor does it have any political agenda.”

The chief of the outlawed Peoples Amn Committee has been facing dozens of criminal case pertaining to murder, kidnapping, extortion and terrorism.
He has been indicted for ordering his accomplices to kill the paramilitary personnel in March 2013.
On Dec 18, the ATC-XVI judge, who is conducting the trial in the judicial complex inside the central prison, reserved his verdict for today after recording evidence and final arguments from both sides.
However, on Friday the court deferred its verdict till Jan 4
Earlier, the court had recorded the testimony of Judicial Magistrate Syed Imran Imam Zaidi, who had purportedly recorded confessional statement of Uzair Baloch in the present case in 2016.
According to the prosecution, Uzair disclosed in his statement that two Rangers personnel, Muneer Ahmed Bhutto and Aijaz Ahmed Baloch, who were on intelligence duty, were kidnapped from the Lyari area and later killed on his orders in March 2013.
The accused pleaded innocence claiming that he never made any confession, thus the alleged statement attributed to him was an attempt to harm his reputation as well as of the PPP.

9,People’s protest will force PPP to withdraw LG law: Siraj,"Holds PPP, MQM, PTI equally responsible for city’s destruction","KARACHI: Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) chief Sirajul Haq on Friday called for restoration of Karachi which, he said, had equally been ruined by the interest-based and flawed policies of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM) and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI).
“People across Sindh, including Karachi, are hopeless of the ruling regimes in the province and at the Centre,” he said while addressing a press conference at the party’s Idara Noor-i-Haq headquarters along with JI city chief Hafiz Naeemur Rahman.
“The PPP, MQM and PTI have ruined Karachi and unfortunately the city has lost its leadership,” he said. 

Holds PPP, MQM, PTI equally responsible for city’s destruction

“Each and every individual in Karachi wants the city to be saved. So we [the JI-Karachi] have launched ‘Save Karachi Movement’ after the PPP government in Sindh had bulldozed the local government bill. But we firmly believe that with the support of people, our movement and agitation by the masses will compel the rulers to withdraw the controversial bill,” he said.
Sit-in outside PA on Friday
He said the masses would be demonstrating a strong protest against the controversial bill outside the Sindh Assembly building on Dec 31. 
All the three parties, he said, had enjoyed the ‘politics of interests’ in the city.
“The PPP doesn’t deliver anywhere in the province,” said the JI chief. “The PTI has also announced packages worth more than Rs1,100 billion for Karachi, but nothing has changed on the ground. The outgoing year proved to be the year of inflation for the people of Karachi.”
He said the MQM on the other hand in 2013 had gifted 15 local government departments to the provincial government of the PPP while in 2021 the same party has snatched 14 more departments of the government.
Speaking on the occasion, Hafiz Naeem said the incompetence of the PPP government had made Karachi a least liveable city. 
“The city, which had been the centre of hope for millions of people across the country, offering them shelter and employment, has now made like hell for its own people,” he said.
“The PPP is playing the politics of hatred and ethnicity in Karachi,” he said. “The people of this city have already suffered a lot due to such mindset, but now they will not allow anyone for another such experience just for the vested interests and political gains of a particular party.”
Earlier on Wednesday night, Sirajul Haq had attended the 75th foundation day ceremony of the Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba (IJT) at the University of Karachi.
Addressing the ceremony attended by a large number of student workers, he congratulated the IJT for maintaining its tradition and lauded its role in creating political and social awareness among the youngsters of the country.

10,Removal of ophthalmology executive director ordered,High Court orders observance of all legal formalities,"HYDERABAD: The Hyder­abad circuit bench of the Sindh High Court on Friday ordered Sindh government to denotify reappointment order of Sindh Institute of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences’ (SIOVS) executive director Prof Dr Khalid Talpur, and fill the post after observing all formalities under relevant law.  
The order passed on a constitutional petition filed by Dr Arshad Lodhi through his lawyers Sarmad Hani and Jawad Ahmed Qureshi said the respondent executive director was free to compete with other candidates for the post.  
The bench comprising Justices Adnanul Karim Memon and Adnan Iqbal Chaudhry had heard the parties on Dec 14 and reserved the verdict which it announced on Friday, allowing the petitioner’s request for declaring the reappointment of the respondent as illegal. 

High Court orders observance of all legal formalities  

The petitioner had cited Sindh government functionaries, including chief secretary Sindh, registrar of Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences and SIOVS executive director, Dr Khalid Talpur, as respondents. 
“Primarily, the appointment in public sector is a trust in the hands of public authorities and it is their legal and moral duty to discharge their function as a trustee with complete transparency as per requirement of law so that no person, who is eligible to hold such post, is excluded from the process of selection and is deprived of his right to appointment in service,” read the order. 
He had prayed the court to declare the Nov 26, 2020 notification for the reappointment of Mr Talpur as executive director as illegal and mala fide, and that the office had been vacant since the respondent’s retirement, which would be filled after advertisement. 
The petitioner said that the institute was established under SIOVS Act 2013 and under July 22, 2013 notification Dr Talpur, who was serving as professor in ophthalmology department, was appointed as its director. 
The respondent retired on Dec 31, 2020 after attaining the age of superannuation but prior to his retirement, the SIOVS Act was amended and Dr Talpur was reappointed as executive director for four years which ended till December 2024 in violation of the directions of Supreme Court, he said. 
The judgment said: “We have noticed that while section 11 of the Act 2013 confers powers on the board of directors to appoint executive director for the institute, it does not expressly empower it to reappoint executive director for another term”. 
“Songs of praise showered by counsel for the respondent and additional advocate general Sindh are meaningless when his appointment had been made on contract for four years without a competitive process,” read the order. 
Advocate Yousuf Leghari, who represented the respondent, quoted examples of Dr Adeeb Rizvi and Dr Rahim Bux Bhatti who were still serving in their respective departments after retirement.  
AAG Sindh Abdul Jalil Zubedi argued that the court lacked jurisdiction in the case. The SIOVS’s board of directors had exercised its power and continued services of the respondent in public interest, he said.

11,"PTI failed to fulfil any commitment made in election manifesto, says Khursheed",Repeats proposal to disqualify any such party,"SUKKUR: Veteran Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) stalwart and former leader of the opposition in the National Assembly Syed Khursheed Ahmed Shah on Friday observed that the Pakisan Tehreek-i-Insaf had utterly failed to deliver as per its manifesto, and repeated his proposal of disqualifying any party that failed to implement at least 50pc points of its election manifesto.  
Mr Shah was speaking at a ceremony held at labour department for the handing over of ownership documents of flats to workers. He said a total of 14,000 flats had been allotted to labourers by the PPP government so far. It was in line with PPP’s promise to give roti, kapra aur makan to all deserving people and part of the party’s manifesto, he added. 
He said PPP during is tenures at federal and provincial levels always worked for the welfare and benefit of the poor masses. In this regard, he pointed out that hundreds of thousands of people were provided jobs and other livelihoods, shelter, income support and other financial relief, heavy increments in salary and pension, besides health and education facilities. 

Repeats proposal to disqualify any such party

He said PPP believed that if workers were made financially strong, this would ultimately make the country and its economy stronger. 
Contrary to that, the PTI government snatched people’s jobs and livelihoods, rendered thousands of people homeless and decreased workers’ salaries.  
Criticising the federal government’s policy, the veteran PPP leader pointed out that an unprecedented rise in US dollar’s rate over the last four years and a constant fall of the country’s economy reflected PTI’s performance. The poor masses were facing backbreaking price spiral, he said, and noted that prices of flour, sugar, edible oil, ghee and all other essential food commodities, as well as fuel prices and gas and electricity bills, had become absolutely unaffordable to them.
Referring to PTI government’s promise of providing millions of jobs and houses to people, Mr Shah said the ruling party failed to fulfil any of the promises it had made to seek vote. He said political parties must not be allowed to deceive the masses through hollow slogans and that was why he had floated the idea of disqualifying any party that would fail to implement at least 50pc of its manifesto points during its rule.
He said he would appeal to people not to vote for the party that failed to deliver as per its manifesto.
He also noted that blackmarketing of fertilizer was becoming yet another scam after wheat, sugar, petroleum and gas crises. The fertilizer shortage, he warned, was bound to devastate not only the provincial and national economy of this agricultural country but also the huge lot of growers, farmers and peasants.

He said the Sindh government wanted to run affairs through one-window operation under the ‘black’ LG law. The last remaining thing the Sindh government needed now was a minister for corruption, he said in a sarcastic tone.  
Sheikh said later at a press conference that Murad Ali Shah had become a security risk as his government was violating the constitution. 
A plan had been made under the ‘black’ LG law to occupy cities of the province and bring them under the total control of Zardari, allowing him to rule as he wished, he said.

This would also lessen financial cost of different schemes, he said.
The leading economist was speaking at the local press club on Friday. Giving a presentation on Chuhar Jamali town of Sujawal district, he said this area had been selected as one of such RGCs being set up under the European Union-sponsored project, of which he was serving as the consultant.
He described Sindh as “Pakistan’s OPEC (Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries)” pointing out that the province contributed the country’s 70pc gas and 80pc coal. 
Once Sindh used to provide resources to Middle East but now it is faced with poverty and this is too evident. Sindh government had approved PRS under which this pilot RGC project at Chuhar Jamali is being executed.
Dr Bengali said that as per the poverty chart, Hyderabad being an urbanised centre has the lowest poverty score of 36.62pc and Thatta has the highest score of 72.97pc followed by Tando Mohammad Khan’s 70.43pc. There are many small villages in the province which were scattered and almost every village has a school. As per one study, [an average] seven students study in a class. “We are working to provide all amenities at a point which will save government’s money,” he said. Clusters of villages where RGCs are to be set up have been selected. Chuhar Jamali with a population of 18,000 people is Sujawal district’s RGC where road, drainage, sewerage, drinking water, health and education schemes are being executed in collaboration with the provincial planning & development board (P&DB). The RGC will have houses, walkways and commercial, social and educational facilities within its 30km radius. 
Dr Bengali said all these schemes had been approved by the P&DB and designed, for the first time, by experts as per international standards.
Dr Bengali proposed that government should plan 3,000 small cities instead of improving 350,000 villages.
