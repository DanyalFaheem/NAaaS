Biden, who took office in January amid the biggest US political crisis for decades, said trends were “largely pointing in the wrong direction” and that “more than ever, democracy needs champions”.
“We stand at an inflection point,” he said. “Will we allow the backward slide of rights and democracy to continue unchecked?”
The two-day event, held by video link because of the coronavirus pandemic, was billed by the White House as US leadership in an existential struggle between democracies and powerful autocracies or dictatorships.
“Make no mistake, we’re at a moment of democratic reckoning,” said Uzra Zeya, the Under Secretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights. “Countries in virtually every region of the world have experienced degrees of democratic backsliding.”
The summit featured opening remarks from Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, with representatives from some 100 governments, as well as NGOs, private businesses, philanthropic organisations and legislatures attending.
Biden went into the summit with the United States facing criticism over the foreign guest list and deep trouble on the domestic political front, with Donald Trump pursuing his shocking attempt to discredit the 2020 election in which he lost.
There was also tension simply over who should be on — and off — the list of invitees. China and Russia, which Biden describes as leaders of the autocracies camp, were demonstratively excluded, prompting scathing complaints.
“No country has the right to judge the world’s vast and varied political landscape by a single yardstick,” wrote ambassadors Anatoly Antonov of Russia and Qin Gang of China in a joint essay last month.
Deciding which other countries should be barred from the summit for human rights abuses or vote rigging was also fraught.
For example, Pakistan and the Philippines were invited, while EU member Hungary’s nationalist government was out. Brazil’s right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro was invited, while the leader of Nato member Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, was shunned. Biden called on world leaders to make concrete pledges during the summit and the United States kicked off with a promise of $424 million worth of programmes to help protect media freedoms, combat corruption and support free elections around the world. These include millions of dollars in US funding for strengthening election integrity and $30m for an international fund for supporting independent media in “resource-poor and fragile settings”.
The most awkward element of the summit, however, was the fact that Biden is struggling to restore faith in democracy at home, let alone on the other side of the world.
Trump refuses to recognise the results of the 2020 election. With the help of sympathetic media outlets, including the powerful Fox News, the former Republican president continues to spread lies about fraud to his tens of millions of supporters.
And with shockwaves from the January 6 storming of Congress by Trump supporters still reverberating, there are growing fears over the 2022 legislative elections and the 2024 presidential vote in which Trump may seek a comeback.
Bruce Jentleson, who teaches political science at Duke University, said the summit was “never a good idea”. “Our problems here are much worse than in any other Western democracy. We had our Capitol building attacked, an attempted coup. We haven’t seen that happen in Paris, or at the Bundestag, or at the EU headquarters in Brussels,” he said.

1,Indian farmers end year-long protests against Modi reforms,NEW DELHI: Indian farmers formally ended year-long mass protests on Thursday after Prime Minister Narendra Modi...,"NEW DELHI: Indian farmers formally ended year-long mass protests on Thursday after Prime Minister Narendra Modi abandoned his push for agricultural reforms, defusing one of the biggest challenges faced by his government.
Thousands of people have been camped on the outskirts of the capital New Delhi since last year to campaign against laws they said would have led to a corporate takeover of the sector.
Modi’s administration rushed through a repeal of the laws last month in a rare backdown, and farmer representatives said they agreed to stand down after the government agreed to other demands.
“Farmers’ unity, peace and patience has been the key to the victory and this will not be allowed to erode in any circumstance,” said Samyukta Kisan Morcha, a coalition of farmers’ unions, in a statement.
Protesters began disassembling their makeshift camps on the highways leading into the capital on Thursday.
They plan to wait until after a funeral for India’s defence chief General Bipin Rawat, who died in a helicopter crash on Wednesday, before returning to their homes on the weekend. Protests had carried on in smaller numbers after the repeal of the laws, with farmers seeking additional concessions including compensation for the families of the more than 700 farmers they say died during the protests.
The government agreed to that demand and also pledged not to prosecute those using fire to cheaply clear their fields — a practice that regularly shrouds Delhi in smog each winter.
About two-thirds of India’s 1.3 billion population draw their livelihood from farming and the sector has long been a political minefield.
Thousands of Indian farmers die by suicide every year because of poverty, debt and crops affected by ever more erratic weather patterns caused by climate change.
The three agricultural laws passed in September 2020 aimed to deregulate farm produce markets, where state bodies have for decades set guaranteed minimum prices for crops.
But the reforms became a lightning rod for opposition to Modi’s administration by farmers, who said the changes would have left them at the mercy of big business.
The protest sites on highways leading into Delhi turned into colourful, semi-permanent camps, with volunteers providing food, sanitation and even dentist surgeries and foot massage parlours.
One rally turned violent in January when a tractor convoy transformed into a rampage that embarrassed the government on Indian Republic Day, leaving one farmer dead and hundreds of police injured.
Modi’s reversal came ahead of important elections for his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh states, both home to huge numbers of farmers.
Economists however said the decision to repeal the laws doomed any prospect of fixing the agricultural industry’s underlying problems.
“The government will always put political considerations such as state elections over sensible economic policy or environmental considerations,” economist Mihir Swarup Sharma of the Observer Research Foundation think-tank said.
“The failure to impose penalties for stubble burning is a serious setback to attempts to improve North India’s air quality, which is the worst in the world by far.”

2,"WHO warns against vaccine hoarding, says Omicron ‘mostly mild’","UN health body’s Africa branch says detections of new cases have almost doubled over the past week to 107,000.","THE HAGUE: The EU medicines watchdog said on Thursday the Omicron variant of Covid-19 may cause milder disease, as the World Health Organisation warned against a re-run of vaccine hoarding by rich nations as the new strain spreads.
The tentative judgement from the European Medicines Agency comes after the WHO said this week there was some evidence that Omicron causes less severe disease than Delta, the currently dominant variant.
The EMA echoed the finding, but said more investigation was being done.
“Cases appear to be mostly mild, however we need to gather more evidence to determine whether the spectrum of disease severity caused by Omicron is different (to) that of all the variants that have been circulating so far,” said Marco Cavaleri, EMA’s head of biological health threats and vaccines strategy.
The highly mutated variant first detected in South Africa sparked global panic when it emerged last month, prompting fears it could be more contagious, cause more severe illness or evade vaccines.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Wednesday said that “emerging data from South Africa suggests increased risk of reinfection with Omicron”.
Cavaleri said that early data suggested Omicron is more infectious than Delta, but it was not year clear whether it would replace the older dominant strain.
He also stressed that there were better means of prevention and treatment available than last winter.
The comments come after Pfizer and BioNTech said Wednesday that a third dose of their vaccine was effective against the variant, and that it was developing an Omicron-specific jab that should be available by March.
Some wealthy countries like Germany and Britain are already hard-hit by a winter wave of infections, imposing new measures to control its spread, and fears of the economic impact have been dogging financial markets.
That prompted the WHO on Thursday to caution against the restrictions on vaccine supply seen earlier this year.
“As we head into whatever the Omicron situation is going to be, there is a risk that the global supply is again going to revert to high-income countries hoarding vaccine to protect (their populations)... in a sense in excess,” said WHO vaccines chief Kate O’Brien.
O’Brien said the WHO was examining data from Pfizer and BioNTech about the booster shot, and that it may turn out that “additional doses have benefit to provide added protection against Omicron”, but stressed it was still “very early days”.
The EMA’s Cavaleri also said that “at this stage we do not have enough data. The agency said later Thursday that Covid boosters “safe and effective” three months after last jab.
The UN health body’s Africa branch said meanwhile that detections of new coronavirus cases had almost doubled over the past week, to 107,000, as the new variant “is reaching more countries in Africa”.
The biggest surge in numbers — 140 percent on average — was in the south of the continent.
However, in South Africa, which discovered the new variant last month, “severe cases remain low,” the WHO said.
It nevertheless called on countries to step up vaccinations — only 7.8 percent of the continent’s roughly 1.2 billion people have been jabbed.
That compares with over 600 million doses administered in Europe alone, according to EMA figures.

3,Media mogul Jimmy Lai among three HK activists convicted over Tiananmen vigil,Amnesty International describes verdicts as the latest “attack on the rights to freedom of expression and assembly” in Hong Kong.,"HONG KONG: Jailed Hong Kong media mogul Jimmy Lai was among three democracy campaigners convicted on Thursday for taking part in a banned Tiananmen vigil as the prosecution of multiple activists came to a conclusion.
Lai, the 74-year-old owner of the now-shuttered pro-democracy Apple Daily newspaper, was found guilty of unlawful assembly charges alongside former journalist Gwyneth Ho and prominent rights lawyer Chow Hang-tung.
Authorities had charged more than two dozen pro-democracy politicians and activists over a vigil last year, which commemorated the victims of Beijing’s deadly Tiananmen crackdown in 1989 despite a police ban.
The trio were the only ones to contest their charges in court, meaning they were the last to receive their verdict.
They argued they went to light candles in a personal capacity and had not “incited” others to join an outlawed rally.
At one point, Chow, a trained barrister who represented herself in court, likened her actions to “tank man” — the figure who famously stood in front of a Chinese tank during the Tiananmen crackdown and became an icon.
But District Court judge Amanda Woodcock dismissed those arguments as “frankly nonsensical” and convicted them of charges including inciting and taking part in an unauthorised assembly.
“The reality was, any intention to come out and participate in the candlelight vigil in Victoria Park that night was an act of defiance and protest against the police,” Woodcock ruled.
Amnesty International described the verdicts as the latest “attack on the rights to freedom of expression and assembly” in Hong Kong and said authorities had criminalised a “peaceful, socially distanced vigil”.
The convictions come as authorities crack down on dissent in Hong Kong and remould the once outspoken finance hub in the mainland’s authoritarian image after huge and often violent democracy protests two years ago.
In practical terms, the latest verdicts make minimal difference to the convicted. Lai, Chow and Ho are among dozens of activists already behind bars facing separate prosecutions under a strict national security law that Beijing imposed on Hong Kong last year.
But their prosecution illustrates how much the gap has narrowed between Hong Kong and the mainland, where authorities have long sought to scrub memories and official records of Tiananmen.
For three decades, Hong Kong’s annual June 4 candlelight vigil would attract tens of thousands of people, which — with its slogans for democracy and ending one-party rule in China — became a symbol for the political freedoms enjoyed in the city.
But Hong Kong authorities have banned the last two vigils citing both the coronavirus pandemic and security fears.
This year, Beijing made it clear it will no longer tolerate Tiananmen commemorations in Hong Kong or Macau, the only two places within China where public remembrance could take place.
Multiple organisers of the annual vigil — including Chow — were charged with the national security crime of subversion while a June 4 museum they ran was closed by authorities and its exhibits carted away.

4,"Israel’s top diplomat in Egypt for talks on Gaza, Iran",Security coordination has been at an all-time high between the regional heavyweights.,"

CAIRO: Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid met President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Thursday during a rare visit to Egypt for talks on the blockaded Gaza Strip and Iran’s nuclear programme, the two sides said.
Egypt was the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with the Jewish state in 1979, after decades of enmity and conflict.
“I thank President Sisi, whose contribution to the region and the relations between us is of historic proportions,” Lapid tweeted. “I presented the president my ‘economy for security’ programme for Gaza and the steps taken by the Israeli government with regards to the Palestinian issue,” he added.
Egypt’s presidency also said the Pales­tinian issue was a key priority.
In his meeting with Sisi, Lapid noted “Iran’s attempts to become a country with a military nuclear capability as well as its continued use of terrorism, and the threat this poses to the Middle East”.
His visit comes a month to the day after both countries struck a security deal to boost Egyptian troop numbers around the border town of Rafah in the restive Sinai Peninsula.
Egypt’s Rafah crossing is the only passage to Gaza not controlled by Israel.
Militants in the Sinai have multiplied their attacks since the army’s 2013 ouster of then Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood.
Operations have been conducted against Islamist militants across Egypt since February 2018. They have mainly focused on North Sinai and the country’s Western Desert. Around 1,073 suspected militants and dozens of security personnel have been killed in the operations, according to official figures.
In a 2019 interview on US television network CBS, Sisi acknowledged Egypt’s army was working closely with Israel in combating “terrorists” in North Sinai.
Security coordination has been at an all-time high between the regional heavyweights, with Cairo playing a key role in negotiating a ceasefire in May between Israel and Gaza’s Islamist rulers Hamas to end 11 days of fighting.

5,Biden orders ‘preparations’ in case Iran nuclear-talks fail,"Bilateral meetings, as well as expert working groups, are expected to continue this week.","WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden has ordered his staff to prepare “additional measures” if troubled talks over Iran’s nuclear programme, which resumed on Thursday in Vienna, fail to reach a resolution.
“The president has asked his team to be prepared in the event that diplomacy fails and we must turn to other options,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.
“We will have no choice but to take additional measures,” she added.
The latest round of talks began last week and were paused on Dec 3 after Western participants accused Iran of going back on progress made earlier this year.
International diplomats restarted the talks on Thursday for what the chair of the negotiations called the “difficult endeavour” of reviving the 2015 deal between Iran and world powers.
The heads of delegations from the parties to the 2015 deal -- Britain, China, France, Germany, Iran and Russia -- were present at the talks in Vienna.
An American delegation plans to take part indirectly in the coming days.
The heads of delegations from the parties to the 2015 deal — Britain, China, France, Germany, Iran and Russia — were present at Friday’s talks, which began at the Palais Coburg luxury hotel at around 12 pm (1100 GMT) and lasted a little more than an hour.
An American delegation plans to take part in the talks indirectly in the coming days.
“Delegations took a stack of the different consultations among capitals and they have come with a renewed sense of purpose to work hard,” Enrique Mora, the EU official chairing the talks, told the press after Thursday’s meeting.
Bilateral meetings as well as expert working groups are expected to continue this week.
Mora admitted that the negotiations were “a very difficult endeavour”, adding: “There are still different positions that we have to marry”.
Russia’s ambassador to the UN in Vienna Mikhail Ulyanov told the TASS agency that Thursday’s talks had “removed a number of misunderstandings that had created some tension,” but did not elaborate. The current round of talks is the seventh since they started in April. In June, Iran suspended them following the election of ultraconservative President Hassan Rouhani and they were only restarted on November 29.
US envoy Rob Malley “will plan to join the talks over the weekend,” said US State Department spokesman Ned Price on Wednesday.
“We should know in pretty short order if the Iranians are going... to negotiate in good faith,” Price told reporters, warning that “the runway is getting very, very short for negotiations.” For their part Iranian officials have insisted they are “serious about the talks”.
“The fact that the two sides are continuing to talk indicates that they want to narrow the gaps,” said Iran’s chief negotiator Ali Bagheri.
The EU’s top foreign policy official Josep Borrell spoke to Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian on Wednesday.

The “healthy baby girl” was born at a London hospital in the early hours and “both mother and daughter are doing very well”, a spokeswoman for the couple said.
“The couple would like to thank the brilliant NHS (National Health Service) maternity team for all their care and support,” she added. Johnson is believed to have been present at the birth. The announcement comes as he faces backlash over the imposition of new coronavirus restrictions designed to curb the spread of the new Omicron variant.
He is also under pressure from the public after claims that Downing Street staff held a Christmas party last year in defiance of restrictions on social gatherings.
His spokesman said Johnson would “take some time” off but the “particularly challenging time for the country” meant he would continue to lead the government.
“You can expect the prime minister to take some time with his family,” he told reporters.
“As ever he needs to balance that with his responsibilities as prime minister and leading the country, which he will continue to do.” Johnson, 57, has been married three times.
