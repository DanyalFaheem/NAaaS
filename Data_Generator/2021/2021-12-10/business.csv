0,"Pakistan’s economy did not overheat, says Shaukat Tarin",Says ease in prices of global commodities will minimise external sector vulnerability of country in the next few months.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s economy did not overheat as commonly believed but faced challenges due to international commodity prices that are now coming down, Finance Adviser Shaukat Tarin said on Thursday.
This ease in the prices of global commodities will minimise external sector vulnerability of the country in the next three to four months, said Mr Tarin while speaking at the concluding session of SDPI’s 24th Sustainable Development Conference titled ‘Beyond the Pandemic: Leaving No One Behind’.
Mr Tarin said the economy is already growing between five per cent to 5.5pc in the current fiscal year. “However, the increase in international commodities prices caused pressure on the external sector of the country. As a result of this increase, inflation in Pakistan also increased along with costly imports,” he said.
Both these factors contributed to rising trade deficit, he said. The adviser noted that prices of gas, petrol and other commodities were already on downward trajectory. “Imports are increased by three to four commodities including petroleum products, steel products and raw materials. This increase is mainly led by an increase in prices and not an increase in quantity,” he added.
Improving revenues
The finance adviser said that one of the indicators of growth in economy was the substantial increase in revenue collection. On the issue of impact of lower and upper-middle classes in urban areas, the adviser admitted the stress of rising prices on these people. We are working on various proposals to minimise it, he stressed.
For sustainable economy, the government is working on improving revenue collection, increasing agricultural productivity and increasing industrial production, the adviser said, adding that the government was working on various proposals in this regard.
Ahead of the finance adviser’s speech, a video message of Prime Minister Imran Khan was run on the screen. The premier said development should be inclusive and must demonstrate trickle-down effects with the aim to empower lower strata of society.
Welfare state model
The PM said the first Muslim state, which was a true welfare state it used to invest in the wellbeing of the poor, including orphans, widows, and daily wagers. He further said it proved the best model of development because it led to the cornerstone of one of the best civilizations.
“I believe that any nation that follows this model will rise. China is the best example of this, which in a very short period alleviated 700 million people from poverty. China exactly followed the model of Riasat-e-Madina by bringing meritocracy and investing in the weaker segment of the society which made their development more inclusive and left no one behind.”
“During the times of Covid-19, there was great pressure on our government to announce a complete lockdown, but keeping in view the vulnerabilities of our people, we choose to go on smart lockdown,” PM Khan said.
Like the developed nations, he added, we have no capacity to feed people at their homes during the lockdown. “Because of the smart lockdown, our food supply chains, agriculture and infrastructure sector did not affect, the premier said, in this way we not only saved our poor people from further economic stress, but also saved our economy,” he added.
Afghan humanitarian crisis
Earlier, at an evening plenary on ‘CPEC in the Emerging Regional Scenario’, National Security Adviser to the Prime Minister Dr Moeed Yusuf said Pakistan did not have the kind of resources to cater for the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, whereas to receive international humanitarian aid, the country has no operational banking channels. However, Pakistan would allow every aid to pass on to Afghanistan. He added.
To a question of hosting the brunt of more Afghans, he said: “We are not in a position to host more refugees, though we are now hosting their third generation.”
He said that the real issue is that how we can prevent the forthcoming humanitarian crises.
On the Sialkot incident, Dr Mooed said that intolerance in any form should not be tolerated and it must be ensured that the writ of the state should not be challenged. He said the entire nation has to stand up against such heinous crimes.
Dr Mooed said the issue of intolerance and mob violence in our society needs to be resolved permanently so that such incidents might not happen in future.

1,"Refineries, suppliers in quandary as power sector reneges on promises",An official says the refineries are currently operating on average 60-65 per cent capacity.,"ISLAMABAD: The Oil Companies Advisory Council (OCAC) and the Directorate General of Oil of the Petroleum Division have warned of supply chain challenges and great financial loss to the oil refineries and state-run oil suppliers because of acute refining and storage capacity constraints as power sector backs off commitments.
The rare warning by the DG Oil came a day after the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) claimed before a parliamentary panel on Wednesday that major reason behind surge in import bill was increase in the import of refined petroleum products which could not be curtailed because of higher demand despite price hike.
The DG Oil alerted relevant government authorities in an urgent warning that OCAC and refineries had repeatedly been highlighting their difficulties including through written communications on Nov 16, 22 and 24 that refineries were heading towards closures.
He said the local refineries were supplying over 11 million tonnes per annum of various petroleum products. However, “due to non-upliftment of furnace oil, owing to limited storages, the refineries are forced to reduce throughput and close the crude processing which will affect the availability of all the other petroleum products eventually disturbing the already fragile supply chain”, he wrote.
An official said the refineries were currently operating on average 60-65pc capacity and full capacity utilisation could significantly increase the production of refined products like petrol, diesel and jet fuels. Energy Minister Hammad Azhar had told Dawn on Wednesday that appropriate payments had been made to IPPs and power plants with the directions to uplift furnace oil from refineries and build stocks at their own storages.
However, the situation had not changed. The DG Oil said the OCAC in its letters had highlighted that OMCs were allowed to import light sulphur furnace oil (LSFO) and high sulphur furnace oil (HSFO) during July-November on the firm demand placed by Power Division but non-upliftment of the committed quantities by the Gencos/IPPs ensued stock build up at OMCs storages. Consequently, the upliftment of furnace oil from refineries was limited and stocks continued to buildup at refineries.
He said substantial payments were released to IPPs this year and one of the conditions was that power plants will keep mandatory stocks as required by their Fuel Supply Agreements with the OMCs. “Today (Thursday), all the storages of power plants are empty and IPPs are maintaining 2-3 days stocks in storages and on the other hand the refineries are planning to export FO at great financial loss. This export will cripple the already overburdened port infrastructure and industry will face huge demurrages as well”, the DG warned.
It reminded that at a recent meeting on fuel position presided over by Minister for Energy Hammad Azhar it was decided that the power plants will uplift FO for stock buildup and for consumption in case of exigencies. However, this has not happened so far.
It called upon the Power Division which also operates under the energy minister to direct the power plants to uplift furnace oil through Pakistan State Oil and Oil Marketing Companies “immediately for stock buildup and provide payments and letters of credit (LCs) to PSO”.
Interestingly, Member FBR Saeed Jadoon on Wednesday told the Senate Standing Committee on Finance that some of the big ticket imports were inelastic and unavoidable despite regulatory duties.

2,Profit rates up for all savings schemes,The new rates will be applicable to deposits and investments made on December 10.,"ISLAMABAD: In line with recent hike in the central bank’s policy rate rate, the Central Directorate of National Savings (CDNS) on Thursday increased profit rates on all national savings schemes by up to two per cent.
The new rates would be applicable to deposits and investments made on December 10. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) had increased its discount rate by 1.5pc to 8.75pc in November and 0.25pc in September.
The return on savings accounts and bonds are linked with the central bank’s policy rates and are normally kept slightly higher to ensure better returns to small savers without drastically affecting the government budget.
According to notifications issued here, the CDNS, working under the Ministry of Finance, increased the profit rate of Defence Savings Certificate (DSC) to 10.98pc from 9.37pc, showing an increase of 161 basis points (bps). It stood at 9.29pc in May this year.
Likewise, the returns on Behbood Savings Certifi­cates, Pensioners’ Benefit Account and Shuhada Family Welfare Account were jacked up to 12.96pc from 11.04pc, up 192bps.
The return on Regular Income Certificates was increased to 10.80pc of total investment compared to existing rate of 8.78pc, up 204pbs. The profit margin on Special Saving Certificates and Special Saving Accounts were also raised to 10.60pc from 8.20pc at present, showing an increase of 161bps.
Also, the return on savings account has been increased to 7.25pc from 5.5pc at present, up 175pbs.
The CDNS has dispatched revised rates sheets to all the regional offices with instructions that existing stock of blank special savings certificates, regular income certificates and defence saving certificates would now be used by affixing rubber stamps with Issue48, Issue45 and Issue44, respectively, along with revised rates before issuance.
Officials said the profit rates were revised owing to 150 basis point increase (from 7.25 pc to 8.5pc) in benchmark interest rates announced by the SBP on Nov 19.
The rates of national savings schemes are announced after every two months and are linked to cut-off yield of the long-term Pakistan Investment Bonds. As of the last auction a few days ago, the return on PIBs range between 9.4pc on three-year paper going up to 12.4pc on 30-year bond.
An official said the rates had been revised upwards due to the rising secondary market yields on long-term PIBs and Treasury bills in line with the increasing policy rate of the SBP.

3,Regulator unearths cartelisation in day-old chicks market,Inquiry finds price collusion of Pakistan Poultry Association and eight hatcheries.,"ISLAMABAD: An inquiry by the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) has found collusion and price fixing of day-old broiler chicks by Pakistan Poultry Association (PPA) as the hatcheries shared rates with competitors through SMS and WhatsApp on a daily basis.
The inquiry has reported a prima facie cartel of eight hatcheries from 2019 to June 2021.
The CCP initiated an inquiry after receiving several concerns from broiler farmers through Pakistan Citizens Portal, alleging a cartelisation in the sector behind the rising prices of day-old broiler chicks.
In this connection, the CCP conducted search and inspections on the premises of the PPA and a company involved in the sale of day-old broiler chicks in June.

Inquiry finds price collusion of PPA and eight hatcheries

A forensic analysis of the evidence impounded from these premises revealed that an official of the said hatchery played a lead role in the cartel by working as the focal person to announce mutually agreed prices of day-old broiler chicks.
Evidence available with the inquiry team shows that the rate announced after mutual discussion between the competitors is the one that actually prevails in the market and that the rate of day-old broiler chicks is the same for all hatcheries.
It has been reported that the official appointed as the focal person for coordinating rates on April 26 messaged to another hatchery “Rs82.5 for three days”.
“When checked, market information on day-old broiler chicks rates showed that the actual rate was Rs82.5 for the next three days,” the inquiry found.
It added that the PPA was also found in prima facie violation of Section 4 of the act as its official was also a part of the WhatsApp group and announcement of rates through SMS and is aware of the pricing discussions and announcements.
The report added that apparently the companies were making a collective decision on prices which culminates in the announcement of a single price by a designated official.
“This prima facie price fixing arrangement between competitors clearly violates Section 4 of the Competition Act 2010,” the inquiry report said.
It is observed that month-wise average day-old broiler chick prices fluctuated widely during the year (2020-21) between the range of Rs20.46 to Rs79.74 per chick, and the share of day-old broiler chicks in total cost changed accordingly.

4,Budgetary borrowing doubles in five months,The government has accumulated most of the liquidity from domestic sources like treasury bills and Pakistan investment bonds.,"KARACHI: The government’s borrowing for budgetary support surged 108 per cent to Rs104 billion during the first five months of the current fiscal year to bridge the widening fiscal gap, showed data released by the State Bank of Pakistan.
Since the spending remains at lower side during first half of the current fiscal year, the budgetary borrowing does not reflect the actual growing need for liquidity.
The government borrowed Rs50bn in the same period of last fiscal year but the fiscal deficit remained high at 7.5pc of GDP or Rs3.41 trillion at the end of FY21.
The fiscal deficit for FY22 has been projected at 6.8pc of GDP but the macro indicators suggest it could be much higher than the target. In the budget FY22, the fiscal deficit was projected at Rs3.99 trillion. The sources of financing were Rs1,246bn from net external financing, Rs2,492bn from net domestic financing and Rs252 as privatisation proceeds.
The government has accumulated most of the liquidity from the domestic sources like treasury bills and Pakistan investment bonds while the net outflow from National Savings Schemes (NSS) reduced the chance to borrow any higher amount.
For the last two years the NSS showing net outflow due to absence of institutional investments.
The government has banned institutional investments in NSS to keep the financial market liquid for advances to private sector.
So far the central government borrowed Rs1,580bn during FY22 as the total debt reached Rs40.279tr in October compared to end of June.

5,Brokers call for doing away with eligibility criteria for GEM board,Representative body says there should be “no disparity between ready and GEM boards” to enable hassle-free trading.,"KARACHI: Stockbrokers have asked the regulator to do away with the investors’ eligibility criteria for trading on the newly launched Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) board.
In a recent letter to Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) CEO Farrukh H. Khan, the representative body of stockbrokers said there should be “no disparity between ready and GEM boards” to enable hassle-free trading.
GEM is a newly launched counter reserved for “growth companies” carrying higher investment and liquidity risks than mature companies listed on the main board. Only institutions or accredited individual investors with net assets of at least Rs5 million can buy and sell stocks on the GEM counter. Trading on GEM began on Nov 26. Two listings have so far taken place on the new counter.
“How can a broker be [held] financially responsible for misdeclaration by its customers?” said the letter by the Pakistan Stockbrokers Association.

Wonder why a broker should face penalty if an investor is taking a risk

According to the notified rules, the PSX mandates relevant broker to obtain a “self-declaration” from an investor if it places a bid for a GEM-listed company without being already marked as an accredited individual. Furthermore, the rules say the broker must honour such a transaction from its own account by rectifying the underlying trade.
“Why should a broker be penalised if the investor is taking the risk?” it said, noting that the regulator should eliminate the requirement of Rs5m net assets because “disclaimers have been given by both the regulators [PSX and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan] to invest at own risk”.
The association said the regulators have not offered an exact definition of net assets. In addition, they’ve not given any cut-off date for assessing the net assets of clients, it said. “There’s no reliable document to ascertain their net assets except wealth statement... which is also prepared by the individual itself,” it stated, adding that obtaining a declaration is a “very time-consuming exercise” requiring constant follow-ups.
Speaking to Dawn, Arif Habib Ltd CEO Shahid Ali Habib said the eligibility criteria mean only 25 per cent of roughly 250,000 stock investors are able to trade shares on the GEM counter.
