As per earlier court directive, the government was supposed to furnish the report, signed by Prime Minister Imran Khan, by Dec 10.
A three-page report submitted by Additional Attorney General Sajid Ilyas Bhatti before the Supreme Court said the prime minister had constituted a four-member cabinet committee to meet aggrieved parents of slain children of the APS to hear their grievance, as earlier suggested by the Supreme Court.
The committee comprises federal Minister for Human Rights Dr Shireen Mazari, Economic Affairs Minister Omar Ayub Khan, Inter-Provincial Coordination Minister Dr Fehmida Mirza and Minister for States and Frontier Regions Sahibzada Mohammad Mehboob Sultan.

Cabinet panel formed to meet parents of martyred schoolchildren, SC told

Attorney General of Pakistan (AGP) Khalid Jawed Khan or his nominee and the additional secretaries of defence and interior ministries would attend the committee meetings as special invitees.
At the last hearing of the case on Nov 10, a three-judge Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Gulzar Ahmed had ordered that the parents of the martyred children should be heard by the government within four weeks and a report signed by the prime minister be placed before the apex court for consideration.
The application moved under Order 33, Rule 6 of the Supreme Court Rules 1980 for extension of time also sought permission to incorporate outcome of the cabinet committee’s meeting with the parents of the APS children in the report to be filed before the court.
In its last order, the Supreme Court had noted that the prime minister had made a statement before it that the government was conscious of its responsibilities and taking all possible steps and actions to ensure that the bereaved parents got proper justice and those people who were responsible for the attack or those who had failed to perform their responsibilities were taken to the task and dealt with in accordance with law.
Moreover, the AGP had told the apex court that the government would ensure dealing with all the culprits and those who did not perform their duties which had led to so much bloodshed, the order had stated.
It had observed that the parents of the APS students were unable to accept the deaths of their children and squarely blamed certain individuals for dereliction of duties.
The earlier order of Oct 20 had recalled that the mothers of the deceased children complained that no FIR had been registered against the persons, who were responsible to ensure security of the APS, Peshawar. They said that persons sitting in high offices had not been taken to task nor they had been declared responsible for neglecting their duty resulting into the death of 147 innocent schoolchildren.
The mothers said the then army chief retd Gen Raheel Sharif, the then interior minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, the then chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Pervez Khattak, the then corps commander of Peshawar Hidayatur Rehman, the then director general of the Inter-Services Intelligence retd Lt Gen Zaheer-ul-Islam and the then interior secretary Akhtar Ali Shah were the people who were at the helm of the affairs and ought to have known about the happening of the incident but they neglected in performance of their duty to the extent that the massacre of the school children happened.

1,New Zealand to ban cigarette sales for future generations,WELLINGTON: New Zealand plans to ban young people from ever buying cigarettes in their lifetime in one of the...,"WELLINGTON: New Zealand plans to ban young people from ever buying cigarettes in their lifetime in one of the world’s toughest crackdowns on the tobacco industry, arguing that other efforts to extinguish smoking were taking too long.
People aged 14 and under in 2027 will never be allowed to purchase cigarettes in the Pacific country of five million, part of proposals unveiled on Thursday that will also curb the number of retailers authorised to sell tobacco and cut nicotine levels in all products.
“We want to make sure young people never start smoking so we will make it an offence to sell or supply smoked tobacco products to new cohorts of youth,” New Zealand Associate Minister of Health Ayesha Verrall said in a statement.
“If nothing changes, it would be decades till Mori smoking rates fall below 5 per cent, and this government is not prepared to leave people behind.”
Currently, 11.6pc of all New Zealanders aged over 15 smoke, a proportion that rises to 29pc among indigenous Maori adults, according to government figures.
The government will consult with a Maori health task force in the coming months before introducing legislation into parliament in June next year, with the aim of making it law by the end of 2022.
The restrictions would then be rolled out in stages from 2024, beginning with a sharp reduction in the number of authorised sellers, followed by reduced nicotine requirements in 2025 and the creation of the “smoke-free” generation from 2027.
The package of measures will make New Zealand’s retail tobacco industry one of the most restricted in the world, just behind Bhutan where cigarette sales are banned outright. New Zealand’s neighbour Austra­lia was the first country in the world to mandate plain packaging of cigarettes in 2012.
The New Zealand government said while existing measures like plain packaging and levies on sales had slowed tobacco consumption, the tougher steps were necessary to achieve its goal of fewer than 5pc of the population smoking daily by 2025.
The new rules would halve the country’s smoking rates in as few as 10 years from when they take effect, the government said.
Smoking kills about 5,000 people a year in New Zealand, making it one of the country’s top causes of preventable death. Four in five smokers started before age 18, the country’s government said.
Vaping, often seen as a safer alternative to smoking and a useful aid to quitting, is also tightly regulated with sales only allowed to over 18s.
Health authorities welcomed the crackdown, while retailers and tobacco companies expressed concern about the impact on their businesses and warned of the emergence of a black market.

2,Imran seeks report on ‘missing’ journalist’s whereabouts,"Assures Mudassar Naaru’s family of thorough probe, all-out support","

ISLAMABAD: Family members of Mudassar Naaru meeting Prime Minister Imran Khan.—APP

 
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Thursday assured the family of Mudassar Naaru of a thorough investigation and all-out support in locating the ‘missing’ journalist and blogger.
The prime minister made this commitment while meeting Naaru’s family members, including his minor son, at the Prime Minister Office (PMO).
According to the PMO, the premier ordered the officials concerned to submit a “complete report” on the whereabouts of Naaru, who has been missing since August 2018.
During the meeting, Naaru’s parents “gave details of what they were going through” since their son went missing more than three years ago, Federal Minister for Human Rights Dr Shireen Mazari, who was present in the meeting, tweeted.

Assures Mudassar Naaru’s family of thorough probe, all-out support

The prime minister met with Naaru’s family after the Islamabad High Court (IHC) last week directed Dr Mazari, in the missing journalist’s case, that the PM and cabinet members meet the family for his early recovery.
“[The] PM reassured them and immediately issued orders for [a] complete report on Naaru’s whereabouts and on exactly what happened,” she wrote.
In a statement, Ms Mazari added “the family felt reassured by the PM, who also said he would ensure the welfare of the young child”.
In August 2018, Naaru had gone on a vacation to Kaghan valley, but did not return. He was last spotted near the Kaghan river. Initially, his family and friends thought he might have accidentally fallen into the river and drowned, but his body was never recovered. Speculations were also rife that Naaru had killed himself, a claim instantly rejected by the family, saying he had no signs of despair.
As per media reports, his family tried to lodge a first information report (FIR) against “unidentified persons”. When the police refused to cooperate, they were forced to approach civil rights organisations, but to no avail. A few months following the disappearance, one of his friends said he had spotted Naaru at a ‘missing persons’ detention centre. That was the last time anyone had heard of him.
In a petition being heard by the IHC seeking the journalist’s recovery, it has been asserted that Naaru, who was also an activist and a human rights defender, had been receiving threats allegedly from officials of state institutions before he went missing on Aug 19, 2018.
In October 2018, his father, the petitioner, approached the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances. The initiation of proceedings by the Commission led to the registration of a criminal FIR followed by the formation of a Joint Investigation Team (JIT).
The petitioner stated that he was not kept informed about the JIT’s proceedings nor was its report shared with him. From 2018 till the filing of the petition this year, the Commission has reportedly held several meetings/hearings. According to the JIT, the journalist has gone ‘missing’ on his own.
While taking up the petition last Wednesday, IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah had asked Dr Mazari to suggest to the cabinet to consider the proposal of imposing a cost on the respective chief executive in whose tenures a citizen went missing.
“The practice of enforced disappearances has existed in Pakistan over a considerable time. The existence of this phenomenon is intolerable in a society governed under the Constitution,” the court noted.
It further observed that enforced disappearance was “a crime against humanity and one of the most detestable manifestations of violation of fundamental rights”.
PM advises civil servants: Vowing to make Pakistan a regional economic leader, Prime Minister Khan came down hard on the previous governments over “faulty long-term planning”.
Criticising what he called the “lack of long-term planning by previous governments”, the prime minister said: “The present government has initiated work on the construction of 10 dams in order to meet the energy and water requirements of the country. Our government inherited huge fiscal debts due to corruption and malpractices of the previous regimes,” he added.
He gave these remarks while addressing officers of the 115th National Management Course. “As decision makers, there will always be two choices: the easy way of earning money and corruption that leads to destruction, and the other is to earn respect and growth which is slow and full of challenges,” he said, adding that civil servants bore a huge responsibility of serving the public and striving for welfare of the masses.
Discussing the need for a single national curriculum, the prime minister said parallel education systems had led to class distinctions.
While answering a question about extremism and the rising number of crimes against women and children, Prime Minister Khan said the main objective of establishing the Rehmatul Lil Alameen Authority was to raise the moral standards of society. “The authority will conduct research and provide guidance based on the life of our Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH),” he said, adding that children had access to every kind of material through mobile phones and for an immature mind such content gave way to misconceptions and extremism.
PM Khan said using force was not a solution to eliminate extremism, rather instilling moral and ethical values in the young generation would create a moderate, tolerant and progressive society.
Achieving economic growth and prosperity was a gradual process, he further said, but the government was committed to implementing long-term reforms in all sectors that would lead to Pakistan becoming a regional leader as it was in the 1970s.

3,Anti-IS coalition ends combat mission in Iraq,"“Relationship with coalition continues in areas of training, advising and capacity building” of Iraqi forces, says NSA.","BAGHDAD: The US-led coalition against the militant Islamic State (IS) group has ended its combat mission in Iraq and will shift to a training and advisory role, Iraq’s national security adviser said on Thursday.
The change in the mission of around 2,500 US troops stationed in the war-battered country by the end of the year was first announced in July by President Joe Biden, during a Washington visit by Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhemi.
The Iraqi government has been under pressure from powerful pro-Iranian political groups with armed wings that have vehemently demanded all US troops leave the country.
“We are officially announcing the end of the coalition forces’ combat mission,” National Security Adviser Qassem al-Aaraji wrote on Twitter.
“The relationship with the international coalition continues in the areas of training, advising and capacity building” of Iraqi forces, he added.
Mr Aaraji was speaking after a meeting between the coalition and the Joint Operations commanders of the Iraqi security forces.
In effect, the about 2,500 US and 1,000 coalition troops deployed in Iraq will remain there. They have been acting as advisers and trainers since mid-2020.

4,Faisal Vawda to face ECP as intra-court plea dismissed,PTI senator is battling a tough situation over dual nationality.,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Thursday dismissed the appeal of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Senator Faisal Vawda and directed him to appear before the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in connection with his dual nationality issue.
An IHC division bench comprising Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb dismissed the intra-court appeal filed against the ECP’s ongoing proceedings on an application seeking disqualification of Vawda for concealing his US nationality at the time of filing of his nomination papers to contest the National Assembly’s election.
Vawda quit the National Assembly to contest the Senate elections.
Hasnain Ali Chohan, Vawda’s counsel, argued that he had challenged an order of the ECP before the IHC’s single-member bench. However, he said, the single-judge bench even added such information to the verdict which was not relevant to the case.

PTI senator is battling a tough situation over dual nationality

IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah on Nov 12 disposed of Vawda’s petition with a direction to the ECP to conclude the proceedings on the application to ascertain as to whether the lawmaker was a dual national at the time of filing of nomination papers for National Assembly.
Justice Minallah observed that in case the ECP found anomalies in Vawda’s declaration, he might be proceeded against for contempt of court since the five-member bench of the Supreme Court had declared that filing a fake affidavit before the returning officer would be contemptuous and besides disqualification it would entail penal consequences.
Justice Farooq perused the said order. He observed that the single-member bench only referred the Supreme Court’s judgement which had introduced conditions for filing of nomination papers.
The counsel was of the view that Vawda could only be proceeded against had the applicant approached the Election Tribunal within specified timeframe.
According to him, after the lapse of the deadline, the ECP could not entertain the application.
Moreover, the counsel objected to Justice Minallah’s verdict and termed the observations illegal that linked Vawda’s case with the verdict of the Supreme Court. Justice Farooq reminded the counsel that his client should not need to be worried if he had tendered accurate information in the affidavit.
Justice Aurangzeb remarked that the court may ask the ECP to conclude the proceedings within a month and advised Vawda to face the inquiry before the ECP.
A contestant against Vawda for the Senate seat, Dost Ali, had filed an application in the ECP against Vawda, seeking his disqualification for hiding information pertaining to his dual nationality.
The petition was filed in 2020 challenging his election as a member of the National Assembly. The petition stated that when Vawda filed his nomination papers for contesting elections, he held dual nationality as he was a US citizen as well.
The petition stated that since Vawda had furnished an affidavit to the ECP declaring at the time of contesting elections that he was not a national of any other country, he had made a false statement on oath, hence he was disqualified under Article 62 (1)(f) of the Constitution.
