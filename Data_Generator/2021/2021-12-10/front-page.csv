0,First suspected case of Omicron reported in Karachi,Health department collects 51 samples in contact-tracing process; large number of people in neighbourhood of suspected patient,"


 
KARACHI: Sindh health department officials collected 51 blood samples in the contact-tracing process on Thursday after reporting the country’s first suspected case of Covid-19 variant Omicron in a female patient residing in Karachi, sources told Dawn.
These samples, they said, would be first tested for Covid-19 and later for genome sequencing, if needed. The samples were also collected from two male members of the suspected patient’s family, who tested positive for Covid-19 and were under treatment at the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), they added.
The sources said the sampling process was carried out in the presence of a team representing the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC), World Health Organisation (WHO) and health department, and the samples were sent to the National Institute of Health (NIH) in Islamabad for genome sequencing.
The sources said the female patient ‘highly suspected of having Omicron variant’ had been discharged from AKUH on Dec 8 and isolated at home along with a female family member in her 80s. Her Covid-19 test results are awaited.

Health department collects 51 samples in contact-tracing process; large number of people in neighbourhood of suspected patient found unvaccinated

The sources said no person of the four-member family had a travel history and three of them, including the suspected patient, were not vaccinated against Covid-19.
“Today, the health department officials visited the neighbourhood of Jamshed Town where the family lives and found that a large number of people residing in the same locality are not vaccinated, prompting the department to immediately start a drive for vaccination,” said Atif Vighio, an official of the health department, adding that people’s movement in the area had been restricted and a vaccination camp would be set up there.
Confusion over case
Initially, the health department officials confirmed detection of the first case of Omicron variant in Karachi. In this respect, a letter written by the health officer of East district to the provincial director general of health was widely shared on social media, according to which the first case of Omicron was reported at 7pm on December 8.
The letter, a copy of which is available with Dawn, stated that the woman, who is 65 years of age, was unvaccinated and did not have a travel history. The rapid response team was “taken on board immediately” for tracing, testing, quarantining, vaccination and other preventive measures to control the infection’s spread as per the guidelines of the NCOC, the letter stated. The district’s deputy commissioner was also requested to take necessary action (micro smart lockdown), according to the letter.
Hours later, Sindh Health Minister Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho in a video statement clarified that a genomic study was being carried to confirm the case of Omicron in a 57-year-old woman. “The genomic study of the coronavirus patient’s sample hasn’t yet been completed but the way the virus is behaving, it seems like it is Omicron,” she said, adding that there was no cause for concern and that the study would take one or two weeks.
Highlighting the threat posed by the new Covid-19 variant, the minister said Omicron was very transmissible but deaths or serious [illness] had not been seen in recent reports coming from South Africa (where the variant was first detected).
“The virus also spreads because people are not vaccinated. This woman was not vaccinated either. I am appealing to you to get fully vaccinated as soon as possible or get the booster dose, if you have already received both doses. It can protect you,” she stressed.
The NIH also stated in a Twitter post that the sample of the coronavirus patient was “not yet confirmed to be Omicron via whole-genome sequencing” which would be performed after the institute received the sample.
It might be recalled that the WHO designated B.1.1.529 a variant of concern and named it Omicron. It has several mutations that may have an impact on how it spreads and the severity of illness.
However, it is not yet clear whether Omicron is more transmissible (e.g. more easily spread from person to person) compared to other variants, including Delta. The number of people testing positive has risen in areas of South Africa affected by this variant, but epidemiologic studies are under way to understand if it is because of Omicron or other factors.

1,"Record has gone missing in Asif Zardari case, NAB tells IHC",“Do you know how the NAB’s actions adversely affected the national economy?” IHC chief justice asks prosecutor.,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Thursday observed that the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has challenged the acquittal of former president Asif Ali Zardari without obtaining the original record of the case, and directed its prosecutor general to review the pending appeals to ascertain whether they are proceedable or otherwise.
A division bench of the high court comprising Chief Justice Athar Minallah and Justice Aamer Farooq was hearing the NAB’s appeal against the acquittal of Mr Zardari in the Ursus tractor reference. An accountability court had acquitted Mr Zardari in the reference in 2014.
The reference pertains to alleged misappropriation of funds in the purchase of 5,900 Russian and Polish tractors at a cost of Rs150,000 each for the Awami Tractor Scheme. Mr Zardari was one of the main suspects along with his wife, slain former prime minister Benazir Bhutto. However, her name was later removed from the reference. According to the charge-sheet, the then government had launched the scheme in 1994 for import of tractors.
The tractor purchase deal allegedly caused a loss of Rs268.3 million to the Agriculture Development Bank of Pakistan — now called Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited — and Rs1.67 billion to the State Bank of Pakistan.
NAB Additional Prosecutor General Jahanzaib Khan Bharwana informed the bench that the original record of the reference had gone missing.
The court noted that it took the NAB seven years to realise that the appeals were filed without possessing the original record, and asked how it happened and warned of penalising the bureau for wasting the court’s time.
Bharwana told the court the record had gone missing while it was being transported from Lahore High Court to the Supreme Court.
Justice Minallah pointed out that the accountability court had acquitted the former president of the charges on merit, adding that it strengthened the perception that the NAB’s references were politically motivated.
“The NAB held others accountable but there is no mechanism of the bureau’s accountability,” the chief justice remarked.
“Do you know how the NAB’s actions adversely affected the national economy?” he asked the prosecutor. Besides, it also defames a citizen of Pakistan by filing references on flimsy reasons, he remarked.
The court issued directions to the NAB prosecutor general to examine the pending appeals and references and only those be kept in courts where the prosecution believed sufficient evidence was available to connect the suspect with the allegations.
Further hearing in the case was adjourned till a date to be fixed by the registrar’s office.

2,Consumers to pay Rs4.7 per unit extra for October power usage,Reports suggest adverse generation mix resulted in Rs44bn higher fuel cost than estimated.,"ISLAMABAD: The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Thursday formally allowed ex-Wapda distribution companies (Discos) to charge their consumers an additional fuel cost of Rs4.74 per unit during the current billing month to mop up about Rs60 billion additional funds.
“Adjustment of an increase of Rs4.7446/kWh shall be applicable to all the consumer categories except lifeline consumers of all the XWDISCOs,” said a notification issued by Nepra. The adjustment, it added, should be shown separately in consumers’ bills on the basis of units billed in the month of October 2021.
The regulator said it observed that prima facie certain efficient power plants were not fully utilised and instead energy from costlier RFO/HSD-based power plants was generated to the tune of over Rs27.521bn in October. The regulator said it also noted violation of economic order, examined the evidence and deducted Rs63.4 million on this count on a provisional basis.
The Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) had demanded that Discos be allowed to charge Rs4.75 per unit additional fuel cost to consumers to raise Rs61bn next month. It said Discos had charged a reference fuel cost of Rs5.173 per unit to consumers in October, but the actual fuel cost turned out to be Rs9.93, an increase of 58pc.
Hence an additional cost of Rs4.75 per unit should be charged to consumers. After some adjustments, Nepra worked out additional fuel cost at Rs4.74 per unit.
Furnace oil-based generation stood at about 11pc of total power supply against just 0.2pc estimated in reference price for October because some coal-based power plants, including Hub Power, had been on outage for over six months and hence coal-based generation stood at 15pc of total generation instead of 25pc projected in reference price.
It was reported that adverse generation mix resulted in Rs44bn higher fuel cost than estimated while the remaining was on account of higher international fuel prices. Power generation was almost 18pc higher in October 2021 than reference estimate and 11pc higher than the same month last year.
It was reported that the share of inexpensive hydropower in the overall power generation was slightly lower than estimated but an increase in prices of imported fuels — coal, LNG and furnace oil — had necessitated additional burden on consumers. The higher electricity rates would be recovered from all consumers this month, except those using less than 50 units per month.
The share of hydropower supply stood at 23.26pc in October instead of 25.48pc estimated in reference tariff. However, hydropower was significantly lower than 36.24pc in September, 35pc in August and had no fuel cost. On the other hand, LNG-based power contribution stood at 23.93pc in October against 25.4pc estimated. It was, however, higher than 18.9pc in September and 18pc in August.
The CPPA reported that total energy generation from all sources in October stood at 11,296 gigawatt hour at a cost of Rs105.06bn or Rs9.3 per unit. Of this, about 10,98GWh were delivered to Discos at Rs109bn, at an average rate of Rs9.93 per unit.
Power generation from furnace oil-based plants stood at 11pc in October against 7.1pc in September and 10.12pc in August. The share of RLNG-based power generation to the national grid stood at about 24pc in October against 19pc in September and 18pc in August. The share of local gas-based generation slightly increased to 9.67pc in October from 8.9pc in September and 8.17pc in August. On the other hand, the share of nuclear power increased to 12.33pc in October from 9.13pc in September and 10pc in August.
The coal-based fuel cost also increased to Rs11.37 per unit in October from Rs10.1 in September and Rs9 in August. The nuclear energy fuel cost stood at Rs1.01 per unit in October against 98 paisa in September. Power produced from local gas slightly dropped to Rs7.8 per unit from Rs8.3 in September. Furnace oil-based generation stood at Rs21.3 per unit and RLNG at Rs16.75 per unit.

3,TTP declares end to ceasefire,Group’s 12 ‘de-radicalised’ foot soldiers released.,"PESHAWAR: The banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on Thursday declined to extend the month-long ceasefire with the government, accusing it of failing to honour the decisions reached earlier. The announcement has put the nascent peace efforts into the doldrums.
A statement issued by the TTP late in the evening gave out details of the six-point agreement that it said it had reached with the government under the aegis of the “Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan” (IEA) on Oct 25, 2021.
The two sides, according to the agreement, had accepted that the IEA would play the role of a mediator and that both sides would form five-member committees each which, under the supervision of the mediator, would discuss the next course of action and demands of each sides.
Both sides, it said, had also agreed to observe a month-long ceasefire from Nov 1 to Nov 30, 2021 and that the government would release 102 “imprisoned mujahideen” and hand them over to the TTP through the “IEA and that both sides would issue a joint statement regarding the ceasefire on Nov 1, 2021”.

Group’s 12 ‘de-radicalised’ foot soldiers released

According to the statement, the government not only failed to implement the decisions reached between the two sides but to the contrary, the security forces conducted raids in Dera Ismail Khan, Lakki Marwat, Swat, Bajaur, Swabi and North Waziristan and killed and detained militants.
“Under these circumstances, it is not possible to extend the ceasefire,” the TTP said.
Earlier in an audio, Mufti Noor Wali Mahsud announced an end to the ceasefire and asked his fighters to resume attacks past 12am. The ceasefire had come into effect on Nov 9.
In the audio, Mufti Noor can be heard as saying that since the TTP has not heard back from the mediators or the government, therefore, past midnight, his fighters reserve the right to resume attacks wherever they were.
The TTP decision to end the ceasefire is a big setback to the government efforts to secure a peace agreement with the militants waging war against the state for decades.
Read: Making peace with militants
Official sources had earlier said that both sides had agreed to initiate “formal talks” and had finalised five names of negotiators each. The government negotiating team included two senior civil officers with good experience of having served in conflict zones. While the TTP said it had formed a five-member committee for negotiations, the government, it appears, took time to notify the committee.
A lot of informal discussions had taken place between the two sides before and during the ceasefire and certain confidence-building steps had been agreed upon to reassure each other, these sources said.
Afghan Taliban are playing the role of principal mediator between Pakistan and the outlawed militant conglomerate comprising several factions.
Government officials say Afghan Taliban have offered Pakistani authorities several options but that they prefer that the TTP be engaged through negotiations and persuaded to return to their country in a peaceful manner.
Ceasefire impact
Ceasefire or cessation of hostilities has remained enforced with no major violations. TTP-led militant attacks inside Pakistan which had seen a dramatic spike in the immediate aftermath of Afghan Taliban’s takeover in mid-August have seen a steady decline, according to data available with Dawn.
These attacks saw a further decrease of 28 per cent since October, when the ceasefire came into effect, according to official statistics of the government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The only notable exception to the ceasefire violations have been 24 attacks mounted by Hafiz Gul Bahadar (HGB) and TTP-affiliated Aleem Khan Khushali (AKK) in North Waziristan. HGB is not part of TTP and had reached a separate ceasefire agreement.
Release of de-radicalised militants
One particular step was the release of some foot soldiers. The government has agreed to release close to one hundred militants being held at ‘de-radicalisation centers’. The first batch of around 12 has already been released. The second batch is expected to be freed in the next few days, to be followed by more in the days and weeks to come.
The ‘de-radicalised’ militants have been screened and made to report to police stations of their areas every two weeks while their movement would be monitored “to ensure they don’t return to what they have been doing in the past”, another source said. “No hard core militant will be released,” this source insisted.
Red lines
The sources say that during the informal talks, it has been made clear to the other side that there are certain redlines which are not open to negotiations. “Pakistan is a constitutional democracy and they have to accept it and abide by it. There will be no grouping or re-grouping, safe-havens, movement of armed troupes or carrying weapons.”
The TTP, however, has set its own conditions which among other things include enforcement of Shariah and restoration of tribal areas to their pre-merger status.
“They know it and they understand it. Tribal areas are now merged districts and they know that there is no going back and that much water has flown under the bridge. Conditions are no longer conducive for them to operate, survive and sustain,” the sources maintain.

4,"Talks with BJP-led India not possible, says PM Imran",Fears US-China confrontation moving ‘towards new Cold War’.,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Thursday said that Kashmir dispute could only be resolved through dialogue, but meaningful engagement with the current government in India was not possible because of its religious nationalism.
Speaking at the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad’s (ISSI) ‘Islamabad Conclave-2021’, PM Khan recalled that South Asia had been held back by political differences and conflicts and listed the Kashmir dispute as the “biggest problem” holding the region back.
He said progress in relations between Pakistan and India had been halted because his government had to deal with RSS’s extremist ideology currently dominating Delhi. “Meaningful negotiations with India are impossible as long as the government there is inspired by this ideology,” he said, hoping that one day India could have a rational government with which resolution of disputes could be sought through logical and sane discussions.
The prime minister expected that once the two arch rivals resolved the core dispute of Kashmir they could then go ahead to jointly fight emerging threats like climate change. He regretted that all of his government’s peace overtures to India had so far been seen in Delhi as its sign of weakness.

Fears US-China confrontation moving ‘towards new Cold War’

PM Khan said he firmly believed that those seeking to resolve disputes through war were mistaken. “They are either unaware of history or they are too proud of their weapons,” he said, adding that they certainly had no consideration for humanity. This, he warned, led to grave miscalculations.
He underscored the need for resolving disputes till the last moment through dialogue.
The prime minister also touched upon the aggravating humanitarian situation in Afghanistan and the growing US-China rivalry. He feared that the US-China confrontation was moving “towards a new Cold War” and foresaw formation of blocs. “Pakistan should try its best to stop the formation of these blocs because we should not become a part of any bloc,” he maintained.
Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi also highlighted this concern in his remarks. “There is accelerated competition between major powers, and a drift towards confrontation. This can lead to new rivalries and push the world again into ‘bloc’ politics. A new Cold War seems to be taking shape,” he observed.
He said Pakistan’s primary interest was in seeking a peaceful and stable international order that takes everyone on board. “Pakistan will remain committed to peaceful coexistence, cooperative multilateralism and consensus-driven outcomes,” he added.
ISSI Director General Ambassador Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry, in his introductory remarks, outlined the objectives of ‘Islamabad Conclave’, especially saying it is for narrative building, global engagement and bridging gaps.
