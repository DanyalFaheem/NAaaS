0,Secret ballot clause withdrawn from LG bill: CM Murad,Says functions of education and health have been withdrawn from local councils after detailed deliberations.,"KARACHI: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Thursday said that the provincial government had decided to do away with the provisions of ‘secret ballot’ and election of ‘any person’ as mayor, deputy mayor, chairman and vice-chairman of a council instead of elected member in the newly passed local bodies amended law as the government was committed to strengthening local council. He welcomed input from the opposition. 
Speaking to the media after a cabinet meeting at CM House, he said that town municipal committees (TMCs) or towns were created on the recommendation of opposition members, including Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan and Jamaat-i-Islami.
“When towns are created, they are opposing them, which is surprising to me,” he said.  
The CM said that TMCs were being introduced in the metropolitan and municipal corporations. “This will help devolution of service delivery at the lower and manageable level. It was a longstanding demand of all major political parties,” he added.  
He said that keeping in view rapid urbanisation in Karachi and Hyderabad it was proposed that there would be no rural area or district councils in Karachi and Hyderabad.  
The chief minister said that the provincial cabinet decided to reserve one per cent or one seat of membership for transgender and differently-abled persons in each local council.  
He said that reserved seats for these segments in local bodies would help bring the marginalised members of society in the mainstream.  
The CM said that in 2013, Naimatullah Khan from Karachi, Nasir Shah from Sukkur, Kanwar Naveed Jameel from Hyderabad and many others were not councillors, but they were elected as nazims and now the beneficiaries of that system, MQM, Jamaat-i-Islami, etc were opposing it.  
“Therefore, the cabinet accepted the observation of the governor and decided that mayors and chairmen would be councillors,” he added.  
On secret balloting and horse-trading, he said: “As per Article 226 of the Constitution ‘all elections under the Constitution, other than those of the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister, shall be by secret ballot.” 
The provincial cabinet had decided that election of mayors/chairmen would be held through show of hands, he added.  
The CM said that after detailed deliberations the functions of education and health were withdrawn from local councils.

1,PM Imran to inaugurate Karachi's Green Line bus service today,Planning Minister Asad Umar vows to move every forum against amendments to Sindh local government law.,"KARACHI: Federal Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Asad Umar has said that no major contribution was made by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz government to the Green Line bus service in Karachi after groundbreaking of the project in February 2016.   
He was speaking to reporters after visiting the route of Green Line on Thursday, a day before formal inauguration of the project by Prime Minister Imran Khan.
“There was only the track but no operation plan, buses procurement policy and business execution in place,” he said. “It was in May 2020 when the federal government finally decided to not only complete the project but also make it functional. So despite the delays caused by the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions, the project has been completed and Prime Minister Imran Khan is going to inaugurate it tomorrow,” he added.

Asad vows to move every forum against amendments to Sindh LG law

About the Karachi Transformation Plan, Mr Umar announced that good progress had been made on all its components for which the federal government was doing the needful. Work was under way at a fast pace on the K-IV project and two other projects -- Karachi Circular Railway (KCR) and freight corridor from Karachi Port to Pipri, he pointed out.
“The good thing is that things have finally started moving for the K-IV water supply project. It has been handed over to Wapda and by August/September 2023, the supply of 260 million gallon to Karachi would finally begin from this scheme,” said the federal minister.
Amendments to LG law
Mr Umar declared in unequivocal terms that the federal government would not accept the recently-passed Sindh Local Government (amendment) Bill 2021. “We will challenge it at every forum – from parliament to courts –  and may also hold street protests if the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) doesn’t agree to withdraw the controversial amendments or incorporate the suggestions proposed by the opposition in the Sindh Assembly,” he said.
No one should have any doubt about a future course of action by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government, which had already moved the Supreme Court for the implementation of the Article 140-A of the Constitution.
“Imran Khan probably is the only prime minister in the history of Pakistan who has approached the SC for the true and effective devolution of powers to grass root level,” said the federal minister.
“So how can we allow such [Sindh Local Government (amendment) Bill 2021] which negates every aspect of the Constitution over devolution of power. As I told you, the PM has already taken up this issue with the judiciary. Now we will be taking it up in both the National Assembly and Sindh Assembly,” he argued.
Sindh Governor Imran Ismail, who was accompanying Mr Umar, seconded his stance. The governor, in reply to a question, explained why he had refused to give his assent to the controversial bill and returned it to the Sindh Assembly for a reconsideration.

2,Rangers given three months to vacate hostel in Hyderabad,Court order says it is for the government to make arrangements for accommodation of Rangers.,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Thursday directed Pakistan Rangers, Sindh, and the provincial authorities to ensure that the hostel of the historical Noor Mohammad High School in Hyderabad be vacated within three months as the building was meant for education purpose.
A single-judge bench of SHC headed by Justice Salahuddin Panhwar said that possession of the hostel, currently being used to accommodate the paramilitary force, be handed over to the management of the school.
The Rangers may need accommodation but such need alone can’t be a reason to occupy such buildings. It is for the government to make arrangement for their accommodation, if needed, according to the court order.
The bench further directed the culture secretary to depute a team to inspect the Noor Muhammad School, Muslim Degree College and Makhdoom Bilawal Hostel within the scope of heritage and all three buildings be notified, if they qualify the required criterion, and be maintained and preserved at the expenses of the state. 
In the light of the last order of the bench about inspection of Noor Muhammad High School, an assistant commissioner of Hyderabad submitted in court an interim compliance report while a deputy director of education also filed a report. The bench was informed that an area of 14,550 square yards (around three-and-a-half acres) of the school’s land was entered in the city survey record in the name of Muslim Education Society in the year 1934 after it was donated by Noor Muhammad Lakhiar Advocate after disposing of all his assets, including his house. 
The reports further said that the buildings of school, hostel and college were of unique in nature having historical value and architecture site as well, adding that the hostel was occupied by the Rangers.
The bench in its order said that the admission regarding historical value and architectural substance of such buildings, prima facie, required that such valuable architectural building must be preserved while keeping the educational institutions’ value thereof.
“Accordingly, issue notice to home secretary, Government of Sindh, Director General, Pakistan Rangers, commissioner Hyderabad as well as chief secretary Sindh with direction that they shall ensure that hostel which is meant for education purpose is vacated within three months. They shall ensure that possession should be given to Noor Muhammad High School’s management”, it added.
Regarding 21 tenants of the shops owned by Noor Muhammad High School, the report said that the tenants were depositing rent with a rent controller. The bench directed the rent controller to ensure that the rent amount was transferred into the account of school and the same must be utilised by the committee as notified by the government. 
The headmaster of school contended that the shops’ spaces were required for education purposes. The bench said they would be at liberty to approach civil court/rent controller for possession of such shops in accordance with law while pleading ground of bona fide need for educational purpose. 
The assistant commissioner sought time to place on record final reports of the deputy commissioner and director education. 
In pursuance of last order, the bench also directed secretary school education to notify the Sindh Education Policy Oversight Council within a week to monitor the public-sector education to overcome the shortcomings pointed out by an SHC-mandated education committee.

3,"Dairy farmers reject official price of fresh milk, allege duress",KARACHI: Consumers on Thursday continued to buy fresh milk at the rate of Rs140 per litre despite the fact that the...,"KARACHI: Consumers on Thursday continued to buy fresh milk at the rate of Rs140 per litre despite the fact that the official price was fixed at Rs120 per litre by the commissioner of Karachi on Wednesday evening.  
The commissioner has raised the official retail price by Rs26 per litre to Rs120 per litre, from Rs94 per litre fixed in March 2018.  
The rates at dairy farmer and wholesale levels have now been fixed at Rs105 and Rs110 per litre, against the earlier official rates of Rs85 and Rs88, respectively.  
It is interesting to note here that consumers have never purchased fresh milk at the official rates because of a lack of enforcement of the government’s writ and ineffective price checking mechanism.  
Retail prices had already been raised before the announcement of the new official prices.  
Speaking to Dawn, many consumers said that official prices fixed by the commissioner’s office did not hold any significance as the price fixing announcement had become a routine official exercise with no practical purpose providing no relief to the masses.  
In March 2021, fresh retail milk price went up to Rs130 from Rs120 per litre, while it further rose to Rs140 per litre in the second week of November 2021 despite no change in official rate at Rs94 per litre fixed in March 2018.  
The spokesperson for milk retailers association Abdul Waheed Gaddi said it would be difficult to sell milk at the controlled rate until the administration ensured milk supply from wholesalers at the new official rate fixed at Rs110 per litre.  
He said he had informed the commissioner in the meeting on Wednesday that retailers were getting milk at Rs130-131 per litre from wholesalers. “We cannot suffer loss by getting milk at higher rates and sell them at reduced rate,” he added.  
President of the Dairy Cattle Farmers Association (DCFA) Shakir Gujjar said the commissioner of Karachi had issued a price notification without taking the stakeholders into confidence in the Wednesday meeting.  
“The notification has been issued without signatures of the stakeholders,” he claimed.  
He claimed that the commissioner and DC Malir had threatened the dairy farmers in the meeting of dire consequences for not signing the notification. 
‘Dairy farmers shifting business’ 
“We reject the commissioner’s decision ... we will go to the high court and also stage a peaceful protest,” he said adding that the commissioner was not realising that the dairy farmers were becoming defaulters and many of them had moved their business to the interior of Sindh and Punjab. “Some 200 dairy farmers have gone to Lahore for dairy farming,” he added.  
Farmers could not survive if they did not get a price above the cost of production, he said while referring to the production cost prepared by the DC Malir which was Rs128 per litre.  
He added that the department looking after the milk sector had prepared production cost at Rs133 while dairy farmers had calculated the cost at Rs155 per litre.  
He claimed that the price gap of Rs20 per litre had been kept between the official retail rate and current market rate only to harass retailers; otherwise fixing retail price at Rs140 per litre would close the door on corruption.

4,Dawn photographer beaten up by Rangers in Karachi,PFUJ and KUJ have condemned the “high handedness of Sindh Rangers against the photojournalist” and demanded action.,"KARACHI: Faysal Mujeeb, a photographer working for Dawn-White Star was manhandled by Rangers personnel while he was covering a Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) event in Azizabad on Thursday evening.
The event, ‘Yaum-i-Shuhada’ was held near ‘Nine Zero’, formerly the headquarters of the MQM led by its founder leader, Altaf Hussain.
Mr Mujeeb said he was doing his professional duty to cover the event. He said relatives of slain MQM activists had started arriving at the venue, ‘Yaadgar-i-Shuhada’ since the morning and were laying floral wreaths and rose petals on their symbolic graves. 
“Media personnel were present at various spots at Yaadgar-i-Shuhada to cover the event. I was also standing at one of the spots, near Tabba Hospital’s gate, where many Muttahida workers were present. Some of them started raising slogans in favour of Altaf Husain prompting Rangers personnel on duty there to start detaining them. I and another media worker, Mehboob Ahmed Chishti, were also picked up,” he said.
Mr Mujeeb said he proved his identity as press photographer and tried his best to make them believe that he was on the duty assigned to him by Dawn. However, he said, the Rangers personnel did not listen to him and started beating him up. “They kept me in detention for about an hour and subjected me to severe thrashing. I was set free only after a Rangers officer came and got my identity verified from his sources,” he added.
He said his camera and mobile phone also got smashed during the episode. Pakistan Federal Union of Jouranlists (PFUJ) and Karachi Union of Journalists (KUJ) have condemned the “high handedness of Sindh Rangers against the photojournalist”. They demanded action against the personnel responsible for the act under the journalists’ protection law.

5,14th International Urdu Conference gets under way,KARACHI: The four-day 14th International Urdu Conference organised by the Arts Council of Pakistan began here on...,"KARACHI: The four-day 14th International Urdu Conference organised by the Arts Council of Pakistan began here on Thursday evening with the usual fanfare.
Two keynote speeches were made in the inaugural session. The first was by distinguished scholar Dr Jaffer Ahmed. The central idea of his paper was the relation between literature and culture. He said that in the last 75 years, the literature and culture symbiosis nurtured literature and enriched our culture. The need to understand this relationship has assumed importance because today we face a crisis in which cultural space is shrinking rapidly, which means we are faced with a huge paradox. We are celebrating culture at a time when it’s confronted with myriads of doubts in society. The need of the hour is that we analyse that how in the nurseries where literary works bloom, aspects such as militarism and intolerance are being watered.
Dr Ahmed said if we look back at the evolution of our literary journey then we will see that without doubt in different periods of the past our cultural space was wide enough to provide writers and thinkers with the right kind of atmosphere to create in. Although writers never get a completely free environment, they somehow find ways to express themselves. In the last more than seven decades our literature has been associated with a variety of schools of thoughts. There has been a battle of ideas in every period. But it had meaningful dynamics. Literature could not progress without culture.
He lamented that these days, things are different and attributed it to three factors. One, the state’s role in trying to confine writers’ scope. Two, encouraging militarism (askariyat pasandi) through curricula and the media. Three, intolerance which is a result of government or official policies.
Eminent scholar and academic Dr Tariq Rahman delivered the second keynote address. He said he would present three aspects about the identity of the Urdu language. The first was about Urdu’s Sanskrit phase. It used to be a language which Hindus and Muslims understood and spoke. The phase ended in the 18th century because of attempts made by individuals such as Shah Hatim, since it had Sanskrit words in it. This meant that Urdu became an elitist language from which people were excluded.
Urdu’s second identity, Dr Rahman said, was to do with Islam, that it is the language of Muslims. There was a period when it was being taught at madressahs. The third exclusionary facet of the language did not just have to do with Hindus or non-Urdu speakers, but it also related to those whose mother tongue was not Urdu – Punjabis, Bengalis, Sindhis etc – who had to face linguistic purism. “Was it an imperialist thing or was it particular elite which now didn’t have power [the British were in power] and in its defence was behaving like that.”
He claimed Urdu was supported by the British. There was an elite group above the Urdu elites, which were the British. They used to keep themselves enclosed from others. So they turned Urdu into an elitist language by emphasising on the right ‘sheen’ and ‘qaaf’. If your sheen qaaf wasn’t right, you would be out of that magic circle. In Pakistan, this language was used in order not to give Bengali, Sindhi and Pashto languages their share. “Urdu is the national language. Why not six national languages?” he asked.
Noted scholar Gopichand Narang, who spoke online from India, said he was born in Balochistan and Pakistan is his real country. His mother tongue is Saraeki but he can speak Balochi, too. However, it is Urdu whose magic work wonders for him. For him, Urdu is a bag of secrets because it’s become part of his very being. Just like the Taj Mahal is the building of buildings, Urdu is the language of languages.
President of the council Ahmed Shah while welcoming the guests stressed on the need for having an intellectual war against those who oppose culture.
Karachi Administrator Murtaza Wahab said language and culture are the most important part of any society. He also recited a poem by Habib Jalib.
Sindh Minister for Culture Syed Sardar Shah said the state instead of having a dialogue with Saad Rizvi should have a dialogue with writers such as Noorul Huda Shah and Kishwar Naheed. He argued Urdu should broaden its horizon to accept other languages. It should play the role of a mother.
Chief Minister Sindh Syed Murad Ali Shah said that it was in 2008 that the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) formed its government in Sindh and it’s also since 2008 that the Urdu conference is being held. After underlining the importance of literature in society, he bemoaned what has recently happened in Sialkot and asked what kind of environment we are leaving for our children. He suggested that the mainstream media should come up with literary programmes and requested the intellectuals and writers of the country to play their part in the effort. He pointed out that encouraging regional languages will increase love and affection amongst people. He added there’s a need to have libraries in every district in order to develop the younger generation’s interest in books.
The session was moderated by Dr Huma Mir.
In the second half of the opening day, Shaam-i-Faiz was on the programme’s list. It was arranged to pay tribute to the legendary poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz.

6,Sulagta Balochistan launched,"KARACHI: Sulagta Balochistan, a collection of Aziz Sanghur’s columns, was launched at the Karachi Press Club (KPC)...","KARACHI: Sulagta Balochistan, a collection of Aziz Sanghur’s columns, was launched at the Karachi Press Club (KPC) on Thursday. 
Introducing the book and its author, academic Dr Tauseef Ahmed Khan said Balochistan, the biggest province of the country, had always been overlooked. “Still the youth of this province are aware and educated. They like to read and write. Aziz Sanghur, one of them, has captured different aspects of Balochistan through his columns,” he said. “I’m all in favour of publishing collections of columns in book form because the collection tells you about all that is happening in Balochistan today and can also help researchers,” he added.  
Senior journalist Saeed Sarbazi said that discussing Balochistan in “this China culture” can be problematic. “So much has happened in Balochistan in the past and there is scope for more research to understand the current affairs of this troubled province,” he said.  
Journalist Saeed Jan Baloch remarked that the title of the book Sulagta Balochistan means ‘Simmering Balochistan’, “but it is really the book’s author who is simmering inside.” 
Another senior journalist Ashraf Khan said that it was not easy to write about Balochistan in that day and age, especially so boldly as Sanghur had done. “It is like he has himself collected all the proofs against himself,” he joked.  
Yet another senior journalist Saeed Usmani said the issues that Sanghur wrote about had put his life in danger. “But he is a whistle blower on the many wrongs happening in Balochistan today, especially in Gawadar. People will read this book as the ‘Red Book’ one day,” he said.  
Writer and researcher Akhtar Baloch said the book was like an encyclopaedia of the races and tribes of Balochistan.  
Senior journalist Maqsood Yousufi said he got an inkling of Sanghur’s potential when he had seen his early documentaries. “They contained all the relevant facts. Similarly, his columns also go into detail of the facts. May God keep him safe as people have little tolerance for truth,” he remarked. 
Journalist and documentary maker Shireen Jami remembered how as a co-worker she had conflicting points of view with Sanghur. “But as we clashed with each other, we also understood each other. While working on various topics, we would also help each other. He is an honest and humble person when it comes to his work,” she said.  
Senior politician Jan Mohammed Buledi said Sanghur had a nice writing style. “He uses simple language to express himself and that is how he lays before you the bare facts. And he does this by also giving the background of issues,” he observed. 
Senior journalist Nazeer Laghari said the book was like a first information report of crimes done against the people of Balochistan.  
Senior journalist, analyst and anchor Mazhar Abbas said that compromises of the people of Balochistan, especially their parliament, had let the people of Balochistan down. “Not taking a political stand has made the Balochistan parliament give strength to the policies that go against the people of Balochistan,” he said.  
The author said: “I am a professional journalist. My kitchen runs on journalism. I have written for several top newspapers including Dawn, The News and The Nation. But for these columns, I would give all credit to my publisher at the Azaadi Akhbar Arif Baloch.   
“My book here is a document for different institutions here to know Balochistan better, to understand why Balochistan is worried. So do read it to see how you can resolve our issues,” he said.  
KPC president Fazil Jamili said the press club upheld human rights and freedom of speech. He also said Balochistan Assembly was not expected to raise its voice as the political parties in that province were made by design. “Then the parliament cannot be expected to take a stand. Therefore, it is for us journalists to fight for the rights of missing people from Balochistan. This event today is more a sit-in for the rights of the people of Balochistan than the launch of a book,” he concluded.   
Journalist and human rights activist Dr Jabbar Khattak, senior reporter and author Shahid Husain and journalist Arbab Chandio also spoke.

The remarkable action, distinguished in the naval history as the first successful kill by any submarine after WW-II, had been taken south east of ‘Diu Head’ on the west coast of India 50 years ago. 
The golden jubilee of the sinking of the Indian navy ship ‘Khukri’ involved an impressive ceremony at Karachi. Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Mohammed Amjad Khan Niazi graced the occasion as the chief guest. Retired vice admiral Ahmad Tasnim, the then commander, was the guest of honour.
Admiral Niazi told the audience that the Pakistan Navy was ready to respond to any threat and misadventure posed by any adversary. ‘Hangor’s triumph serves as a lesson to the enemy and a testimony of highest standard of professionalism and selfless devotion of our veteran submariners,” he said. 
The naval chief highlighted Hangor’s valour during the 1971 war saying that the action was not only a spectacular tactical battle executed perfectly, but it was also in the strategic domain that Indian aggressive designs were effectively neutralised. 
He said that the sinking of ‘INS Khukri’ plummeted the morale and will of the Indian navy to engage further in the battle. He also underscored the inspirational role to the veterans’ dauntless sacrifices and daring acts that helped transform PN into a “force to be reckoned with”.
The ceremony was attended by Hangor’s veterans and a large number of senior serving and retired naval officers. The valiant hero, retired vice admiral Ahmad Tasnim who had led the intrepid action, also spoke. He attributed the success to the entire team and crew members who formed the stepping stones to achieve the final kill. 
Commemorating the Golden Jubilee of Hangor Day, steel cutting of the 5th Hangor class submarine, the first to be built indigenously in Pakistan, was also held at the Karachi Shipyard and Engineering Works (KS&EW). 
The submarine would be named as ‘PNS Tasnim’ upon its commissioning. The naval chief expressed his gratitude to all those involved in the construction activities and termed the steel cutting ceremony another event of deepening relation between Pakistan and China. 
The ceremony was attended by representatives of DA China and other high-ranking officials including distinguished guests from the embassy of China in Islamabad.
On the 50th Hangor Day, the promo of a special telefilm ‘Hangor S-131’ was also released. Besides, a submarine seminar on ‘Technological Advent in Artificial Intelligence: Impact On Sub-Surface Domain’ was also held at the Jauhar Auditorium, Karachi. Other major features of the celebration included the launch of a book, Story of PNS Hangor, authored by retired rear admiral Mian Zahir Shah, along with issuance of a commemorative stamp and a coin.

He said at the launching ceremony of a book Covering agriculture compiled by agricultural experts Naveed Ahmed Abbasi and Prof Dr Aijaz Ali Khoonharo at the university’s campus in Tandojam on Thursday that economic conditions in Sindh were precarious with 70 per cent population living below poverty line even this day.
He said that government bore 67pc cost on higher education and students had to share 33pc. Only 10pc of youth were pursuing higher education while 90pc were deprived of it, he said.
Ali Hassan Bhutto, chairman of Sindhi Skilled Development Programme of Sindhi Association of North America (SANA), said that fewer students from Sindh were getting education in the United States institutions when compared with students from other provinces of Pakistan. SANA was striving to enroll more Sindhi students in the US educational institutions and in this regard scholarship opportunities and training were being imparted to them, he said.
Dr Aijaz Ali Khoonharo, dean of Faculty of Social Sciences, said that books were best friends of students, researchers and agricultural experts. The book Covering agriculture preserved latest information about basic aspects of agriculture and agricultural sector, he said.
Naveed Ahmad Abbasi, compiler of the book, said that modern knowledge from crop production technologies up to basic aspects of fertilisation had been collected in this book which would be helpful for agricultural experts as well as graduates. 
The valuable information gathered in once place would be easily accessible to experts as well as novices and indeed go a long way in the development of much neglected farm sector in the province, he said.  
Dean of Faculty of Crop Production, Dr Qamaruddin Chachar; Prof Amin Mohammad Soomro, Dr Velo Soothar and others also attended the programme.

Workers in other towns of the district also staged demonstrations in solidarity with their colleagues. 
Special Assistant to Prime Minster on Sindh Affairs Dr Arbab Ghulam Rahim said while speaking to the protesters that they would continue the protest on the road till their demand for immediate removal and expulsion of Mithi SSP Hassan Sardar Niazi was accepted.
He said that police officials posted in Tharparkar had let loose a reign of terror on his supporters and PTI workers for the past many months. They would continue the protest at the same venue for an indefinite period, he said.
He informed the protesters that he was leaving for Karachi to meet Prime Minister Imran Khan and apprise him of the situation in Tharparkar and other districts. Mr Khan had asked them to carry on with the protest, he said and asked leaders and workers of PTI from other parts of the province to join their protest and expose PPP rulers. 

Arbab demands immediate removal of Mithi SSP

He said that SSP Niazi was responsible for registration of dozens of cases against their supporters at the behest of PPP leaders. The SSP ordered SHOs of different police stations of the district to register FIRs against their supporters and voters on flimsy charges soon after he was posted in the district, he said, adding that the workers were subjected to inhuman torture during detention. 
He said that they were forced to ask their supporters and PTI workers to take to the streets against such brutalities. PTI workers were directly targeted when they protested against the murder of Dodo Bheel allegedly by the security guards of a mining firm, he said. 
He said that Thar had always been a peaceful region where people had lived peacefully despite political differences but over the past few years PPP leaders had spread terror across the area with the help of police. 
Dr Rahim claimed that Asif Ali Zardari sent him an invite through Chaudhry Pervez Illahi, Rehman Malik and some common friends to join PPP but he refused and rather preferred to join PTI in the best interests of the country. 
He said the PPP was no longer a political party, it had become a bunch of corrupt and criminal men, who wanted to perpetuate their rule in Sindh by committing criminal activities and looting public money. 
He lashed out at PPP MNA Dr Mahesh Kumar Malani and warned him to mend his ways and stop doing dirty politics. “Dr Malani and his cronies are using police force to silence their political opponents,” he said. 
PTI leaders MNA Lal Malhi, Krishan Sharma, Khan Sahib Togachi, Arbab ahsan and others also spoke on the occasion.

They said that in other districts of the province, the process of verification, interviews and submission of papers had already started.
The protesters demanded Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah and Education Minister Syed Sardar Ali Shah they should order the officers concerned to begin  recruitment process of the IBA test passed candidates in the district immediately. 
They urged the chief minister and the minister for education  to take stern action  against the officers of  Dadu education department who were deliberately dilly-dallying on the recruitment and unnecessarily causing them stress. The uncertainly was killing them, they said.

Provincial secretary of Public Health Engineering Department, PPP MNA Sikandar Ali Rahpoto and officers of various departments arrived in Sehwan and set up a camp to seek proposals from general public on how to resolve all issues. 
The town, which falls within constituency of Syed Murad Ali Shah and is considered a stronghold of Pakistan Peoples Party, faces numerous problems, major among them acute shortage of drinking water, faulty drainage system and potholed roads.
Recently, citizens and social workers launched a consistent drive on social media besides holding protests on roads about the worsening state of affairs in the chief minister’s hometown to attract attention of authorities concerned.  
The campaign finally achieved its target on Thursday when the chief minister took its notice and sent the officers concerned and elected representatives to the town to hold meetings with people and resolve their problems. 
In a meeting with PHED secretary, PPP district president raised objections over the town’s existing drainage system and suggested constructing underground drainage from Dhamal Chowk to Dadeji bridge at Khosa Mohalla. 
MNA Rahpoto warned local officer of PHED Jamshoro to improve the drainage and water supply schemes and ensure supply of drinking water to all parts of the town. If they failed punitive action would be recommended against them, he said. 
The secretary said that proposals would be submitted to the chief minister for improving the drainage and water supply systems in the town and launch new schemes. 
Officials of various departments like works and services, buildings, highways, roads, irrigation, health, education and district administration of Jamshoro also visited different parts of the town to learn about the problems and address them.  
Sindh United Party’s secretary general Roshan Ali Buriro said that PPP rulers were only interested in minting money, they had no interest in developing the town. Heaps of garbage were lying about the town, which might cause diseases among devotees of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar who frequented the town from different parts of the country and abroad, he said.
