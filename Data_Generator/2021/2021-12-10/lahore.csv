Among them, Rs800,000 were taken away from Asif Razzaq, executive member of the local chamber.
Dwellers are living in a sense of insecurity as Dera Ghazi Khan city has been in the grip of dacoities, vehicle snatching and theft incidents.  
In Dera Ghazi Khan city are six police stations – City, B-Division, Civil Lines, Saddar and the CIA staff – to maintain the law and order of the city.
Other than robberies, 96 cases of vehicle snatching were registered under section 381-A of the PPC. Up to 20 incidents of theft were registered too.
The month of December started with a Rs70 million robbery in the Gaddai police area where gunmen stole medicines from a multinational’s warehouse, owned by Sheikh Naqeeb, on Dera-Quetta Road. 
The footage of at least 70 CCTVs installed in and around the warehouse show 11 robbers spent more than four hours at the warehouse pinning three guards. They loaded medicines worth Rs70 million on three trucks and fled.
City president of the Traders Association Jan Alam Leghari and Dera Ghazi Khan Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Dr Shafique Pitafi demanded immediate arrest of robbers and recovery of the looted items.
District Bar President Azmat Islam Ghilzai said the main cause of the alarming increase in robberies, vehicle theft and street crime was the side effects of posting of non-resident station house officers who did not know about the area and localities of the city circle.
He demanded withdrawal of the policy regarding the appointment of non-resident police officers in the district.
District Police Officer Muhammad Ali Waseem told Dawn that different teams were working to trace the criminals.

2,Shehbaz asks Zardari not to target Nawaz,"""Zardari's statement about Mian Nawaz Sharif is unfortunate. We should refrain from such remarks,"" says Shehbaz.","LAHORE: Putting his weight behind his elder brother, PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif has advised PPP Co-Chairman Asif Ali Zardari not to target former premier Nawaz Sharif the way he (Zardari) did during his stay in Lahore.
The Pakistan Peoples Party, according to one of its leaders, has made it clear that it will no longer be friendly with PML-N, however, its cooperation with it being an opposition party in parliament will continue.
“Zardari Sahib’s statement about Mian Nawaz Sharif is unfortunate. Zardari sb knows the conditions in which MNS had to go abroad. We should refrain from such remarks & work for the greater good of the country,” the opposition leader in the National Assembly said in a tweet on Thursday.

 



 
Mr Shehbaz’s statement came three days after Mr Zardari took on Nawaz Sharif for ‘fleeing’ the country.
“He (Nawaz) who does not wish to die on the soil of the homeland can do nothing for the country. The PML-N is against the homeland,” Mr Zardari had said while speaking at Bilawal House in Bahria Town on Monday last to celebrate the party’s ‘rebirth’ in the Punjab capital.
He also said Nawaz Sharif got demarcation of constituencies on the basis of biradaris (castes) after the 1977 polls and pledged to reshape these constituencies as per the original blueprint after winning next elections.
Shehbaz Sharif reminded Mr Zardari of Nawaz’s unwavering commitment to the country. “Mian Sahib’s unwavering commitment to Pakistan has always been unquestionable,” he said.
Nawaz Sharif has been in London since November 2019 for his ‘medical treatment’.
A PML-N leader told Dawn that Mr Zardari was not expected to get that much harsh on Mr Nawaz. 
“After deliberations for a few days, the party leadership finally decided to give some response to Mr Zardari,” he said.
Earlier, Maryam Nawaz and some of her group issued harsh statements against the PPP leadership for its decision not to resign from assemblies.
The PPP thinks that the PML-N leadership has got panicky after seeing its (PPP) comeback performance in NA-133 by-poll. PPP’s Chaudhry Aslam Gill secured over 32,000 votes against PML-N’s Shaista Pervaiz who bagged 46,000.
“The PML-N’s uneasiness after the PPP’s comeback in Lahore seems obvious. Some of its leaders even had started using harsh language and levelling baseless allegations against the PPP after the result (in NA-133) shows that it (PML-N) is feeling the pain of its return. PPP was founded in Lahore and Punjab remained its stronghold. It was our strategy that produced a good result and unnerved the PML-N,” PPP senior leader Chaudhry Manzoor told Dawn.
Mr Manzoor said the PPP was doing its own politics but in Punjab, it would take on the PML-N. “We will no longer be friendly with the PML-N, however, our cooperation with it being an opposition party in the parliament continues,” he said.
Meanwhile, opposition leader in Punjab Assembly Hamza Shehbaz chided Prime Minister Imran Khan for his “irresponsible” statement in which he said that the inflation rate in Pakistan was much less than the world. “Time has come to use all options available to rid of Imran Khan,” he said while talking to reporters here on Thursday.

3,Lahore again tops list of world’s most polluted cities,The city’s air quality index was 443 that put it in the hazardous category.,"LAHORE: Lahore again topped the list of the most polluted cities of the world on Thursday with hazardous air quality levels.
The city’s air quality index was 443 at 10am that put it in the hazardous category with regard to PM2.5 (particulate matter) level. At the time of filing of this report at 10:25pm, Lahore was still at the top of the list of world’s most populated city with air quality index of 270 (very unhealthy), followed by Hanoi (Vietnam) whose index was 209.
On the other hand, the district administration demolished two more pyrolysis plants on Thursday as it continued its operation against such plants in an effort to control smog.
The number of such demolished plants has now reached 20.
The city district teams raided the plants and demolished them for different violations, including unsealing the plant without permission, erecting different structures without approving maps from the authorities and causing pollution.
The plants were extracting furnace and crude oil from wires and used tyres to sell it in at a low rate. The demolished plants included Mohsin and Iqbal plants in Shalimar tehsil.
Earlier, DC Umar Sher Chattha visited three development schemes where he was briefed about various projects.
Meanwhile, on the direction of Chief Minister Usman Buzdar, ‘Diwar-e-Ehsaas’ has been set up in Multan after Ehsaas Bazaar. DC Amir Kareem inaugurated the ‘Diwar-i-Ehsaas’ and distributed clothes among the needy.

“This increase is a record increase in the history of the province, which was approved on the recommendations of various departments.

The minister said most of the additional funds would be spent on health, education and infrastructure projects.
“The Punjab Special Health and Medical Education Department will receive additional funds of Rs18.526bn for the completion of 22 health schemes across the province while the Punjab Primary and Secondary Health Department will receive Rs7.5bn for the completion of six schemes. The Lahore Development Authority will receive additional funds of Rs7bn,” he explained.

Justice Jawad Hassan passed the stay order on a petition filed by M/s Superior Connections Pvt Ltd challenging the tender notice issued on Nov 24, 2021 published in the national as well as international newspapers by the PMC.
At the outset of the hearing, the petitioner’s counsel, Saad Rasool, sought the court’s permission to implead M/s SOAR Testing Pvt Ltd, which had won the previous bid for the tests, as respondent in the petition. The permission was granted.
The counsel argued that the petitioner/company had been providing facilities in the fields of education, media, healthcare and information & technology and being aggrieved, it knocked the door of the court against action of the PMC of issuing the impugned tender document in favour of the respondent (SOAR Testing). He said the PMC had previously procured the services from the respondent company without adopting the principle of transparency in the bidding process.
The counsel pointed out that educational career of a number of students, who had to appear in the MDCAT, was involved and the petitioner was the only company which met the conditions mentioned in the impugned evaluation criteria. He said the National Assembly, after discussing in detail on current issues of the PMC and MDCAT in a meeting held on Nov 11 also rendered the view that the firm previously providing the services should be blacklisted and the PMC should reconduct the MDCAT through renowned universities.
Advocate Rasool submitted that the criteria given in the tender was harsh in nature and sufficient to oust all the competitors providing the services.
Justice Hassan issued notices to the respondents for Dec 20 and directed a law officer to seek instructions from the relevant quarter(s) and also ensure submission of report and parawise comments by the respondents.
The PMC had invited the tender documents on or before Dec 9, which were to be opened on the same day.

6,Wheat price: Punjab passes on farmers’ concerns to Islamabad,LAHORE: The Punjab government has conveyed the concerns of wheat growers on minimum support price to the federal...,"LAHORE: The Punjab government has conveyed the concerns of wheat growers on minimum support price to the federal authorities, though without offering its own recommendations on the matter.
Agriculture Secretary Asad Rehman Gillani says some representatives of farmers called on Chief Minister Sardar Usman Buzdar and Agriculture Minister Syed Hussain Jahania Gardezi recently and expressed their worries about the rising cost of production of the wheat crop as rates of fertilizers, particularly phosphate-based compost, have shot through the roof at the time of wheat plantation.
Farmers believed that the Rs1,950 per 40kg minimum wheat support price announced by the federal government a few weeks ago was unable to meet the higher cost of production of the crop, Mr Gillani says.
They argued in the meetings that diammonium phosphate (DAP) fertilizer used to be sold at Rs3,300 per bag at the time of wheat sowing last year, but its rate has gone up to Rs8,500 this season besides increase in prices of other farm inputs, he says.
The secretary says that the provincial government decided to convey these concerns to the federal authorities and accordingly his office wrote a letter, containing reservations of the farming community about the support price, to Islamabad.
An official related to ascertaining the production cost of various crops, however, says that the higher rates of fertilizers had been accommodated to some extent in the wheat cost of production for the 2021-22 season. According to him, the relevant agriculture wing had considered the DAP rate at Rs6,500 per bag while calculating the production cost of the crop. With 25 percent of profit margin, the indicative price of wheat has been suggested at Rs2,085 per 40kg, he says, claiming the farmers will not be in loss and only their profit margin will reduce even if the government does not revise upward the minimum support price.
Kisan Ittehad president Khalid Mahmood Khokhar, however, is upbeat that the federal government will give a positive response to the plight of wheat growers.
He warns of wheat smuggling out of the country if the government does not increase the support price because the rate of grains in the international market is ranging between Rs2,500 and Rs2,600 per 40kg at present.

7,Afghanistan offers security to railway project,"The access to Pakistan’s ports will enable Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Russia to export their goods to several countries.","LAHORE: Afghanistan has offered Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Russia complete security and safety to the rail service envisaging access to various Central Asian states up to Karachi and Gwadar ports.
The access to Pakistan’s ports will enable the countries, especially Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan, to export their goods to several countries through sea routes, according to a senior official of the Pakistan Railways.
“Under the Trans-Afghan Railways’ plan devised by the authorities in Pakistan and Afghanistan, two routes are being considered to connect Mazar-i-Sharif (Afghanistan) with Peshawar (Pakistan). One route is 700km long and another 900km. Besides this, four proposals related to financial arrangement, feasibility, etc., regarding these routes are being worked out,” Pakistan Railways’ chairman Dr Habibur Rehman Gilani told Dawn on Thursday.
Pakistan believes that easy communication, swift transportation and minimised trade barriers are key to economic growth, as these measures lead to comprehensive and inclusive growth of the whole region. Thus, regional connectivity is inevitable to attain economic growth. Keeping in view the situation, the federal government started working on increasing the regional connectivity through rail network.
A two-day conference of the multilateral Joint Working Group was held through a video link a couple of days ago to discuss the flagship project of Mazar-i-Sharif-Kabul-Peshawar rail corridor. Representatives of Pakistan, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Russia, and Kazakhstan attended it.
The conference, presided over by Secretary/Chairman of Railways Habibur Rehman Gilani, was attended by the representatives of various ministries of Pakistan.
The project, which strongly supports the 2017-30 Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation region railway strategy, intends to equip the region’s railways to better capture evolving trade flows and contribute to regional economic development by improving rail and multimodal infrastructure and commercialising and reforming railway activities.
Uzbekistan is already connected through rail network with Afghanistan and Central Asian countries, including Kazakhstan.
Mr Gilani said all participants of the virtual conference were unanimous to speed up the process for laying track from Mazar-i-Sharif to Peshawar via Kabul.
“During the conference, a work plan / line of action and protocols to proceed further were also signed by the respective countries’ representatives,” he said, adding that Kazakhstan had also expressed its interest in financing the Rs30bn project for rehabilitation of the decaying up /down railway track from Khanpur to Kotri (over 850km) -- a portion frequently witnessing accidents since long.
In December last year, Pakistan had signed a letter with Afghanistan and Uzbekistan and sent it to international funding institutions reportedly seeking $4.8 billion loan for trans-Afghan rail project.

S.W Sugar Mills, Gojra Samundari Sugar Mills and others challenged the legality of the notices and the jurisdiction of the CCP.
Advocate Sultan Ali Awan contended on behalf of the mills that the impugned notices had been issued on the basis of an illegal inquiry report prepared under a redundant law of 2007. He further stated that petitions against previous notices were already pending before the Supreme Court and the commission issued the fresh impugned notices to the petitioners.
The counsel also questioned the existence of the CCP saying the commission, under the law, shall consist of not less than five members and not more than seven. However, he said, at present there were only four members of the commission in utter violation of the mandatory provisions of the Competition Act 2010. He argued that the entire composition of the CCP was neither in accordance with law nor it fulfilled the mandatory statutory requirements.
The counsel asked the court to set aside the impugned show-cause notices and also declare the CCP a non-existent, invalid and illegal for being not in consonance with the law.
The court suspended the operation of the impugned notices and sought replies from the respondents by Dec 15.

A number of statements from Indian prime ministers Indra Gandhi and Narendra Modi and some diplomats were shown on the slides with their claims and plan about dismembering Pakistan and also helping the Awami League and training Mukti Bahini guerrillas.
Dr Junaid said he carried out in-depth research on the creations of the 1971 incidents.
He said a myth was created that the government had ignored East Pakistan which was not true. Efforts for industrialisation, development of infrastructure, including airlines, ports, oil fields/ refinery and hydroelectric projects showed that significant attention was paid to East Pakistan’s progress.
He said the first issue surfaced when Urdu was declared as a national language and East Pakistan people did not support it. Some policemen in misadventure shot some students dead on Feb 21, 1952, and later the day became the Mother Language Day.
He said it was propaganda that Operation Searchlight (March 25, 1971) was launched against innocent civilians. After Chief Martial Law administrator Yahya Khan’s announcement to postpone the National Assembly session, the Awami Leaguers took to the roads. They were armed and started vandalism, arson, loot, and killings.
He said from the National Assembly session postponement till the start of Operation Searchlight thousands of innocent people had been killed, the national flag was desecrated every day, and jailbreaks occurred regularly. Due to this lawlessness, Operation Searchlight was launched against Awami League leaders and its militant supporters.
Mr Ahmed rejected the figure of the genocide of three million Bengalis, saying that there were no official data to prove it. Only Sheikh Mujibur Rehman announced this figure after he returned to Bangladesh and several investigative accounts had rejected these fictitious claims.
He also argued the number of soldiers who surrendered and called it exaggerated and false. The actual number was 34,000 troops, and 11,000 police, rangers, scouts and militia. This made the total number of combatants 45,000.
Accordingly, the number of 93,000 as conjured by Indians is ill-founded.
He was of the view that the current government also had sentenced a number of people to death, forgiven by her father after the creation of Bangladesh. Pakistan and Bangladesh could become friends and the governments of both sides should cooperate with each other. The only threat to peace in the region is India.

The show, titled ‘The Fragmented Whole’, features more than 40 paintings by the artist.
According to a statement, the highly personal visions communicated in Lubna Jehangir’s paintings are steeped in Sufi tradition, inspiration drawn from Sufi thought, folklore and mythology. Her work has a dream like quality. The flowing lines and her colour application technique are stylised and have a rhythmic flow. Minuscule dots, that require a high degree of concentration, heighten the delicacy and intricate detail in her work. She defines the technique she employs as; “Miniaturist Pointillism” - an amalgamation of the west and east. Once when asked by a fellow artist “why the dots?” Her response was “I fragment the line as I don’t like walking the straight and narrow!” Each dot is unique in shape, form and in intensity of its colour, mimicking the stars that fill the night skies.
Lubna sees herself as someone who has survived difficult professional and personal emotional journeys, which many women find themselves entangled in as they try and negotiate their way in an overwhelmingly patriarchal society. Refreshingly, she does not subscribe to the subjectivity of a victim. If anything, she feels that she has shed a lot of negativity and emerged a stronger individual.
Lubna prefers to remain ‘backstage’ so to speak. Thus, at one level, as she says, “the entwined flowers and twigs, the colours alongside monochromatic treatment, represent the deceptiveness of my mannerism. It all looks colorful and attractive; yet there are barriers that protect from complete exposure.”
The show would continue for a week.

A person called police on their helpline but a team reached there quite late despite the fact that the Saddar police station is located at a stone’s throw from the college.  

A private college held function after getting special permission

The event was arranged on the special permission of the Director Colleges, Bahawalpur division, who issued a letter DIR(C)BWP/REG/28368 on Wednesday last to Deputy Director Colleges RYK. 
“It is submitted that the submission of undertaking of the College RYK for the youth festival is considered with the condition that no immoral activities will be done in the function.”

Sources told Dawn that 147 lecturers had been absent since 2013, seven since 2014, 22 since 2015 and 14 since 2017. The notices have been issued to them under Section 7(b) of The Punjab Employees Efficiency, Discipline and Accountability Act 2006. The absent lecturers have been asked to inform the HED about their whereabouts within “seven days”.  
Dr Ashiq Hussain, DPI Colleges, told Dawn over phone that the absence of 190 lecturers from duty for more than one year was a “misconduct”. He said most of them either went abroad, joined another job/career or probably died “but in either case, they did not inform HED”.  
He said that at the time of promotion, cases of absent lectures got “deferred” which means even after absence of more than one year, the department is bound not to declare “deferred seats” as vacant. He said the purpose was to keep 190 seats vacant for overdue promotion of those who are working as regular employees in the college cadre.  
The department is not holding any inquiry against absent lectures because under Section 5 (1) (a) of PEEDA Act -2006 it is not required if absence is more than one year.  
RAPE: The Fatehsher police have arrested a prayer leader for raping his 12-year-old student at a seminary.
