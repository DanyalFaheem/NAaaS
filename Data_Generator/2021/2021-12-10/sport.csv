The West Indies will play three Twenty20 and as many One-day Internationals -- all in the port city of Karachi -- starting on Monday, their first visit since 2018.
A Pakistan official said a 26-member party had flown to Karachi early on Thursday before being escorted by heavy security to the team hotel.
The series comes three months after New Zealand quit their first tour to the country in 18 years shortly before the opening match in Rawalpindi was due to start following a security alert. That was followed by England’s decision to withdraw visits by their men’s and women’s teams scheduled for October.
Pakistan officials were furious with the cancellations, arguing security measures were lock-tight.
The cricket-mad nation endured a long spell without a visit from an international team following a terror attack on a bus carrying the Sri Lankan team in Lahore in 2009.
Pakistan were forced to play their home international matches abroad -- mostly in the UAE -- until 2015, when normal service tentatively resumed.
This West Indian squad is somewhat under-strength, with regulars Evin Lewis, Shimron Hetmyer, Andre Russell and Lendl Simmons all opting out for personal reasons.
Former skipper Jason Holder is being rested, while Fabian Allen and Obed McCoy are out because of injuries.
Last week, captain Kieron Pollard also withdrew through a hamstring injury, leaving the Twenty20 leadership to Nicholas Pooran and ODIs to Shai Hope.
Four players — Akeal Hosein, Sheldon Cottrell, Dominic Drakes and Odean Smith — were to join the team later Thursday.
The three T20Is are on Dec 13, 14 and 16, while the ODIs will be held on Dec 18, 20 and 22.
Squads
T20: Nicholas Pooran (captain), Shai Hope, Darren Bravo, Roston Chase, Sheldon Cottrell, Dominic Drakes, Akeal Hosein, Brandon King, Kyle Mayers, Gudakesh Motie, Romario Shepherd, Odean Smith, Oshane Thomas, Hayden Walsh Jr, Rovman Powell
ODI: Shai Hope (captain), Nicholas Pooran, Darren Bravo, Shamarh Brooks, Roston Chase, Justin Greaves, Akeal Hosein, Alzarri Joseph, Gudakesh Motie, Anderson Phillip, Raymon Reifer, Romario Shepherd, Odean Smith, Hayden Walsh Jr, Devon Thomas.

1,"Centurion Head, lucky Warner put Aussies in command at Gabba",BRISBANE: David Warner set up the innings with a chance-filled 94 and Travis Head took over with an unbeaten century...,"BRISBANE: David Warner set up the innings with a chance-filled 94 and Travis Head took over with an unbeaten century after a mini-collapse in the middle order to guide Australia to 343-7, giving the hosts a 196-run lead, in the Ashes series opener at stumps on the second day here at the Gabba on Thursday.
Warner had a big reprieve on 17 off a no-ball from Ben Stokes, one of the many times the England all-rounder overstepped but one of the few he was called for. Warner was also dropped in the slips on 48 and narrowly avoided being run out as he scrambled back to his crease on 60.
But he ran out of luck after sharing partnerships of 156 with Marnus Labuschagne (74) for the second wicket and 23 with Steve Smith (12) for the third, finally out just after the tea interval when Ollie Robinson took two wickets with consecutive deliveries.
Robinson had Warner caught in the covers by Stokes and then bowled Cameron Green, who didn’t play a shot to a ball that hit his off stump, during a period when Australia slid from 189-2 to 195-5.
New wicket-keeper Alex Carey successfully blocked the hat-trick ball, his first delivery in Test cricket, but was out for 12 as England clawed back to have the Australians at 236-6.
Head and captain Pat Cummins combined in a 70-run stand that restored Australia’s dominance and accelerated the scoring as England’s fielding got ragged.
The partnership ended when England skipper Joe Root picked up the wicket of his counterpart, having Cummins caught at leg slip.
Head continued with Mitchell Starc and was on 96 when he attempted a sweep to Root, was hit on the arm and Burns couldn’t reach as the ball ballooned down the leg side.
He reached his century from 85 deliveries with a driven boundary off Chris Waokes, ending any uncertainty over his selection with the third-fastest Ashes century an innings containing 12 fours and two sixes.
Head was felled by a full-toss from Mark Wood when he was on 105, hit on the glove and helmet before falling to the ground, but recovered to finish unbeaten on 112 at stumps.
“Today it went my way, but a lot of the work was done by the top order,” Head said. “England got on a little bit of a run. I just tried to get some momentum back and once we got that, try to take advantage of it.”
Warner’s survival and Stokes’ delivery stride were the two main talking points on Thursday.
Warner got his first reprieve from the TV umpire after being beaten by Stokes, bowling his first over in a Test match since March.
TV broadcaster Channel 7 showed Stokes had also overstepped the crease on his previous three deliveries and not been called by the umpires. The Ashes broadcaster later revealed Stokes had overstepped the front crease 14 times in the opening session on the second day and had only been called twice for a no-ball.
Cricket Australia said a technology problem at the Gabba meant that the third umpire, Paul Wilson, couldn’t review TV replays of every delivery to check if bowlers were over-stepping the crease, leaving it to the on-field umpires to make the calls.

Later, asked about getting bowled off a no-ball, Warner said:  “You’ve  got to try and keep your feet behind the line as a bowler.”
Meanwhile, the International Cricket Council (ICC) said it expects technology that  enables the third umpire to check for no-balls to be available for the  remainder of the Ashes series.
The ICC said that the England and Australia teams had  been informed before the match at the Gabba that an equipment  malfunction would mean a return to protocols used before the technology  was introduced last year.
“We will continue with the old protocols  during this match but expect the technology to be available again from  the next Test,” an ICC spokesperson said.
Robinson returned the best figures for the England bowlers, taking 3-48 from 18 overs on an extended second day, and also having a chance put down.
Left-arm spinner Jack Leach picked up the key wicket of Labuschagne, but was otherwise punished by the Australian batting line-up and and returned 1-95 from 11 overs.
Stokes was restricted to just nine overs and conceded 50 runs, appearing to be struggling with his fitness when he bowled late with the old ball.
England bowling coach Jon Lewis said Stokes would have been able to fix up his bowling run-up if he’d been called for no-ball earlier by the umpires.
Lewis also defended the make-up of the bowling attack, despite veterans Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad missing selection and spinner Leach struggling against the Australians.
“If we’d all bowled to the best of our ability, we would have put Australia under more pressure,” he said. “We took seven Australian wickets, were still behind in the game but there’s still three days left in this test match. I’m sure were going to come back strong.”
On Stokes’ no-balls, Lewis said the bowler could have mended his run-up with an early no-ball call.
“What a fast bowler needs is some sort of understanding of where his feet are,” Lewis told a news conference. “It  would’ve been nice for his first ball to be called a no-ball, so he  could then have made an adjustment, and from then he would’ve been  behind the line because he then knows where his feet are.”

2,Siegfried Aikman named Pakistan hockey team’s coach,Khawaja Junaid to remain coach for Asian Champions Trophy.,"LAHORE: In a bid to revive the flagging fortunes of the national hockey team, the Pakistan Hockey Federation has turned to Dutch coach Siegfried Aikman. 
Aikman was unveiled as the team’s new head coach on Thursday, a day before its departure for Bangladesh to take part in the Asian Champions Trophy. 
The head coach at the Asian Champions Trophy, though, would be Khawaja Junaid while Aikman will travel as part of the team management. Aikman will take full charge following the Asian Champions Trophy, which begins Dec 14. 
“Aikman will be coach the team for the next five years, till the 2026 FIH World Cup,” PHF secretary Asif Bajwa said at a news conference, flanked by both Aikman and Junaid. 

Khawaja Junaid to remain coach for Asian Champions Trophy

Aikman, who has Indian-Surinamese roots, was previously coach of the Japanese team, taking them to the Asian Games gold medal in 2018 before leaving following this year’s Tokyo Olympics. 
“With Aikman’s appointment, the PHF has filled all its bases to bring Pakistan back to the top table of world hockey,” Bajwa said, with the PHF having also appointed former Olympian Ahmed Alam as the team’s goalkeeping coach. 
Aikman informed that he had met with the national team players on the last day of the training camp on Thursday. 
“The boys have the potential but it’s about harnessing that in the right way,” Aikman said. “We will move ahead in future through short and long term plans to improve Pakistan hockey and bridge the gap between Pakistan and the top teams in the world.” 
Aikman, who acted as a consultant for the Pakistan team at the recently-concluded FIH Junior World Cup in India where the team finished 11th, said his main focus would be to improve players’ fitness levels. 
“We also need to make the boys mentally strong and work on improving their technique,” he added. 
Junaid said that he welcomed Aikman as head coach and they would “work as one team” at the Asian Champions Trophy. 
A reunion with Japan comes quickly for Aikman with Pakistan facing his former side in their opener on Dec 14. Pakistan will then face Malaysia on Dec 15, two days before their clash with arch-rivals India. Pakistan will face South Korea on Dec 18 and will finish their round-robin campaign against hosts Bangladesh the following day. 
The final is set for Dec 22. 
“I can’t predict what will happen at the Asian Champions Trophy but we will work hard to give our best,” Aikman said.  
Pakistan were declared joint-winners with India in the last edition of the Asian Champions Trophy in Oman in 2018 after the final could not be played due to a thunderstorm.

3,Cricket Australia chief backs Tim Paine to make Test return,"“We want to see him back out there, playing and performing, as quickly as possible,"" says CEO Nick Hockley.","MELBOURNE: Cricket Australia (CA) chief executive officer Nick Hockley hopes Tim Paine returns to country’s Test side  “as quickly as possible” after the wicket-keeper resigned from the captaincy because of his involvement in a  “sexting” scandal.
Paine disrupted Australia’s Ashes preparations weeks before the start of the series when he stepped down as captain before it was announced he would take an indefinite break from the game, citing mental health issues.
“Would love to see him play again, for both his state and for Australia,” Hockley told SEN. “We want to see him back out there, playing and performing, as quickly as possible.”
Hockley added that the CA had sought to support Paine through the situation.
“The head coach has been down to see him. We’ve had members of our high-performance set-up go down to [Tasmania]. The Tasmanian cricket community have put their arms around him,” Hockley said.
“We are all very, very concerned ... a lot of respect for Tim for owning his mistake and our job now is to really support him.”
Paine has also received support from Australia coach Justin Langer, who did not rule out a potential return to the international side for the 37-year-old.

4,Shahid Afridi to represent Gladiators in his last PSL,LAHORE: Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi will represent Quetta Gladiators in what will be his farewell HBL...,"LAHORE: Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi will represent Quetta Gladiators in what will be his farewell HBL Pakistan Super League 7 after participating for Multan Sultans last year, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) announced here on Thursday.
Also moving from Sultans to Gladiators is England’s James Vince and, as part of this blockbuster trade, Multan Sultans will take Quetta’s Diamond and Silver round picks, respectively.
In another major trade, player of the National T20 Iftikhar Ahmed has joined Quetta after being part of Islamabad United for the 2021 season. He has swapped teams with wicket-keeper/batter Azam Khan, who has moved to Islamabad United from Quetta Gladiators.
Afridi, the big-hitting all-rounder, said he would like to end his PSL career with victory.
“I am excited to join Quetta Gladiators, a side that has had a roller-coaster ride in the past few events despite winning the title in 2019. In my final HBL PSL event, it will be my dream and wish to sign off with another HBL PSL trophy after tasting success with Peshawar Zalmi in 2017,” the 44-year-old veteran said.
“The HBL PSL is an event that encourages and inspires a player to give his very best. I will use the same motivation to help my team and put up performances that can help us achieve our event objectives.”
Meanwhile, Iftikhar said: “It has been a difficult decision to move from Islamabad United, but looking ahead to my future in T20 cricket that is linked to the Pakistan team, I thought this was the best move. I am grateful to the Islamabad United management for their support and understanding, as they have continued to stand behind me in all my decisions.
“I am thrilled to be rejoining Shahid Afridi at Quetta Gladiators after 2017, when we last played together in HBL PSL. Quetta Gladiators include a number of my contemporaries with whom I have played a lot of cricket. I am sure the HBL PSL 7 will be an exciting and entertaining event, and I can make a positive impact through my batting, bowling and fielding,” Iftikhar added.
The HBL PSL draft 2022 will be held at the High Performance Centre in Lahore on Sunday, with the event to kick-off at 3pm. Each side will come to the draft with a maximum of eight player retention from the last event.

5,"Barca out of Champions League, snow extends group stage",LONDON: Barcelona’s 17-year streak of advancing to the Champions League knockout rounds each season ended on...,"LONDON: Barcelona’s 17-year streak of advancing to the Champions League knockout rounds each season ended on Wednesday with an exit from the group stage that failed to finish on time because of snow in Italy. 
Barcelona fell to a 3-0 loss at Bayern Munich that dumped the five-time European champions into a dismal and deserved third place in Group ‘E’. 
“We start a new era, from zero, from here,” Barca coach Xavi Hernandez, who rejoined a club in crisis last month, told broadcaster DAZN. 
Bayern’s perfect six straight wins started with a 3-0 win at Camp Nou in September, and a repeat result at home let Benfica rise above Barca and into the round-of-16 draw on Monday by beating Dynamo Kiev 2-0 in Lisbon with first-half goals by Roman Yaremchuk and Gilberto. 
Only 15 of the 16-team lineup in the knockout stage were known on Wednesday night. 
The Atalanta-Villarreal game to decide who will finish runner-up in Group ‘F’ was postponed by heavy snow in the northern Italian city of Bergamo. The group was already won by Manchester United before they drew 1-1 on Wednesday with last-place Young Boys at Old Trafford. Mason Greenwood’s acrobatic effort putting Ralf Rangnick’s side ahead before Fabian Rieder equalised. 
UEFA later asked Atalanta and Villarreal to try again on Thursday evening. 
A grim evening for Spanish sides saw Sevilla join Barcelona in being eliminated, failing to advance from the wide-open Group ‘G’ where all four teams kicked off in contention. 
Lille, the team lowest-ranked by UEFA in the group stage, seized top spot by beating VfL Wolfsburg 3-1 in Germany. Salzburg beat Sevilla 1-0 to advance to the round of 16 as runners-up. The consolation for third-placed Sevilla is a switch across to the second-tier Europa League where they are the record six-time title-holders. 
Defending champions Chelsea and Juventus had already sealed their round-of-16 places from Group ‘H’ but first place in the group was in play on Wednesday. 
Chelsea were stunned by Zenit St. Petersburg’s leveller deep into stoppage time for a 3-3 draw in Russia that let Juve secure top spot with a 1-0 win at home to Malmo. 
Juve will be in the pot of seeded teams with the other group winners in Monday’s draw, where the unseeded pot now includes Chelsea and Paris St Germain. 
Before Lionel Messi left for PSG, in all 17 years of his first-team career at Barca the club took its place among the elite in the round of 16 each February. They won four Champions League titles in that era. 
In the club’s first post-Messi season, the Europa League playoffs now beckon after a group-stage campaign that brought more 3-0 losses (three) than goals scored (two). 
The decline also extends at home and to the club’s finances. A current seventh place in La Liga is outside the European qualification spots and years of big spending on wages mean there is no quick fix for the prodigal son who returned last month to coach the club. 
“We need to work hard, many things that put Barcelona in this situation. But this is our reality. I cannot say anything else,” Xavi said. 
Bayern won the group with a 22-goal tally that was more than twice as many as the other three teams combined. 
Goals from Thomas Mueller, Leroy Sane and Jamal Musiala against Barca ensured Bayern matched Ajax and Liverpool who completed their six straight wins on Tuesday. 
SALZBURG, LILLE ADVANCE 
Bayern were joined by Salzburg in playing in empty stadiums — just like 2020 in European football — during the first waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Salzburg’s first entry into the knockout rounds, with Noah Okafor scoring the only goal before Sevilla had Joan Jordan sent off, follows several years as junior partner to fellow Red Bull affiliate Leipzig, who placed third in their group on Tuesday and will switch to the Europa League. 
Lille are through to the knockout stages for the first time in 15 years after their win in Germany. 
Burak Yilmaz gave Lille an early lead and Canadian striker Jonathan David made it 2-0 in the 72nd minute before Angel Gomes got their third. Renato Steffen got a late consolation. 
Chelsea were on course to top their group as they led 3-2 away to Zenit going into injury time. 
But then Magomed Ozdoev’s stunning strike earned Zenit a 3-3 draw, allowing Juventus to snatch first place as Moise Kean’s goal gave them victory against Malmo. 
Timo Werner had tapped in to put Chelsea ahead in the second minute, but Claudinho and Sardar Azmoun both scored before the break for Zenit. 
Romelu Lukaku’s first goal in nearly three months made it 2-2, and Werner’s second of the night looked to have won it for Chelsea before Ozdoev struck. 
“My analysis is very clear: our behavior changes when we have a lead and this is something we never did and we should never do,” said Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel.

“Thanks to our discreet diplomacy, the Taliban accept and support the delivery by the IOC of humanitarian aid to members of the Olympic community who still live in Afghanistan,” said Thomas Bach, the IOC president.
He was speaking after the second day of an Executive Board meeting at which the IOC earmarked $560,000 (493,000 euros) in aid for about 2,000 Olympic and Paralympic athletes to be distributed by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Following the return to power of the Taliban in mid-August, 300 Afghan athletes, coaches and officials were evacuated on humanitarian visas obtained by National Olympic Committees from their governments.
“This is a work in progress,” Bach said.  “It has become more difficult to get a humanitarian visa for people from Afghanistan than at the very beginning of this evacuation, nevertheless we are in talks with a number of governments and we hope that one or the other will come to fruition.
“Because this has slowed down we have reinforced the humanitarian community to overcome the very harsh winter in Afghanistan.”
On Tuesday, Bach said the IOC had begun discussions with the Taliban on Nov 18 in Qatar about those who remained behind, especially women and girls.
“We have clearly explained to them that free access to sport, without any gender, ethnic, religious or other discrimination, is fundamental for the respect of the Olympic Charter,” he said.

11,‘No medical exemptions granted to Australian Open players’,"“To be clear upfront, no one can play the Australian Open unless they are vaccinated,” says tournament director Craig Tiley.","SYDNEY: No tennis players hoping to compete at the Australian Open have yet been granted medical exemption from vaccination, tournament director Craig Tiley said on Thursday, as he reiterated that everyone at Melbourne Park would need to be fully inoculated.
Tiley also said that Novak Djokovic being named on the Australian Open entry list on Wednesday implied nothing about his Covid-19 vaccination status, which the world number one has declined to disclose, citing privacy.
“To be clear upfront, no one can play the Australian Open unless they are vaccinated,” Tiley told the ABC.
“The only condition at which, outside of being vaccinated, that you could compete is if you receive a medically approved exemption from Australian authorities ...
“I’ve seen reports this morning. There’s been no medical exemptions that have been granted at this point.”
Tiley added that appearing on the entry list had no bearing on whether Djokovic would actually be in Melbourne from Jan 17-30 seeking a 10th Australian Open title and a record 21st men’s Grand Slam singles title.
“Everyone goes on the entry list,” Tiley said.  “It’s not a commitment list about exactly who’s in the draw. That comes in several weeks’ time when the actual list and draw gets finalised for the Australian Open.”
Serena Williams was not on the list, having decided not to compete on advice from her medical team, and neither was Roger Federer, who is still recovering from a series of knee operations.
Djokovic said last week that he would be making a decision  “very soon” about whether to travel to Australia.
