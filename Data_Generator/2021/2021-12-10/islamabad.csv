0,"NOC sought for linking Leh Expressway with I.J.P. Road, 10th Avenue","Design for bridge will be simplified to minimise land acquisition in Pindi, CDA officials...","ISLAMABAD: The Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) has sought a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to connect Leh Expressway with I.J. Principal Road and 10th Avenue.
The Leh Expressway is a project of RDA while the I.J.P. and 10th Avenue projects are being constructed by the CDA.
Officials said recently RDA had requested CDA to issue an NOC for connecting Leh Expressway with 10th Avenue.
A few days ago, a meeting was held at the CDA headquarters, attended by CDA’s engineers and consultant Zeeruk International (PVT) and the consultant of RDA, Nespak, to review the design of the proposed overhead bridge which will link Leh Expressway with 10th Avenue.
CDA officials said during the meeting the consultant of the RDA mentioned that the proposal had been prepared in consultation with CDA’s consultant and the design was being simplified in order to minimise land acquisition on Rawalpindi side.
An engineer of the CDA said: “The plan envisages linking the Leh Expressway with I.J.P. through simple at-grade slip lanes and linking the 10th Avenue with Leh Expressway through an overhead bridge over I.J.P road.”
It was also discussed that traffic generated from 10th Avenue will make the Leh Expressway project more feasible as it will be a tooled road. Therefore, construction charges of the overhead bridge, whether through Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) or under the public private partnership, should be borne by the RDA.
“It was also decided that issues as elaborated above need to be discussed in the next higher forums – Ecnec and CDWP,” read minutes of the meeting, adding a representative of the RDA requested for issuance of conditional NOC as the Capital Development Working Party (CDWP) had instructed RDA to get the NOC from CDA.
The consultant of RDA was asked to verify the grades of linkages and mark the coordinates of start point of 10th Avenue and Leh Expressway along with costing of the overhead bridges and additional works for linking the expressway with 10th Avenue for further action, read the documents.
It was also decided that the design of Leh Expressway should be implemented till 10th Avenue by RDA. 
The issue of toll sharing and cost of land to be paid to the CDA shall be taken up in CDWP and Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) for a decision.
Leh Expressway is the pet project of Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed and is said to be a major road project in Rawalpindi that will cater to the needs of a large number of people. Recently, RDA started demarcation of land which will be acquired for the project.
The rehabilitation of I.J.P. Road and 10th Avenue are CDA’s projects. Currently, the project of overhauling and rehabilitation of I.J.P. Road is in progress while a few days ago CDA awarded contract of 10th Avenue to the lowest bidder, National Logistics Cell (NLC), which submitted a bid of Rs10.2 billion.
According to CDA officials, 10th Avenue will be constructed in two phases. In the first phase, a five-km-long road will be constructed from I.J.P. Road/Katarian Bridge to Srinagar Highway near the edge of G-9 and the starting point of G-10. Once started, work on the project will be completed in 21 months.
The officials said in the second phase, the road will be constructed from Srinagar Highway to Margalla Road.

1,Cold wave forecast from next week,"RAWALPINDI:As the temperature dropped to 4°C in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, the Meteorological Department said the...","RAWALPINDI:As the temperature dropped to 4°C in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, the Meteorological Department said the mercury will further drop next week as cold winds will be entering the country.
December and January are the coldest months in the twin cities during which the temperature usuallydrops to -1 to -2°C .
“A cold wave in Rawalpindi and Islamabad and upper parts of the country is expected in mid-December as cold winds from the north will enter the country,” said Met Office spokesman Rashid Bilal while talking to Dawn.
He said there would also be chances of light rain in scattered areas of the Potohar region and upper parts of the country.
When his attention was drawn to social media reports that a cold wave may hit the country at the end of this month which will break the record of the last 50 years, he said such predictions were fake as “we cannot predict the intensity of the cold wave.”
On the other hand, the Met Office issued an outlook for the season from December to February which said currently a La-Niña condition was prevailing and likely to continue with moderate intensity in December-February while the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) condition was expected to approach towards a neutral state during the forecast period.
Based on the global and regional circulation patterns, a tendency for normal precipitation is predicted over most parts of the country during the period.
Gilgit-Baltistan, Kashmir and northern parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are expected to receive slightly above-normal precipitation while the southern belt, comprising the adjacent parts of Sindh and Balochistan, will receive slightly below-normal rainfall.
The central parts are likely to receive near-normal precipitation from December to February.
Dry and stable atmospheric conditions during the current season may cause thick foggy conditions in plain areas.
The dry conditions are likely to adversely impact the air quality index in urban (southern and central Punjab) areas, resulting in smog development.
The mean temperatures are likely to remain below-than normal due to the prevailing dry conditions during the forecast season, it added.

2,Works show evolution of artistic process,ISLAMABAD: Light gives art life. It directs the gaze and is the main tool of an artist while he or she creates...,"ISLAMABAD: Light gives art life. It directs the gaze and is the main tool of an artist while he or she creates. 
This was pointed out by organisers of an exhibition titled Lumieres arranged at the Pakistan National Council of Arts (PNCA). The theme of the show brought attention to the importance of light for art. Works made by six female artists identified as Marium Agha, Farida Batool and Risham Syed from Pakistan, Safaa Eruass from Morocco, Christine Ferrer and Genevieve Gleize from France have been put on display.
Supported by the French Embassy in Pakistan and PNCA, the project was conceptualised over a year ago amid various lockdowns due to the Covid-19 pandemic.



 
Christine Ferrer’s installation showed the connection between the human body and the mind.
Farida Batool is an independent artist who explores Pakistan’s political upheavals and tumultuous history through her work. She used virtual reality (VR) to transport the viewer inside another space that was a mixture of visuals.
Trained in visual communication at the École Supérieure d’art d’Épinal, Genevieve Glieze, said, “Time is at the heart of my research as a photographer, especially in the almost obsessive exploration of neglected universes. If it is true that absence is one of my main subjects and that photography consists in capturing the fleeting, that a lens seizes a place, an object, a being with acuity, I wish that my photography contributes to animate the seized moments in their paradoxical immobility, faithful at the same time to their portion of second and to the parts of real and imaginary stories which it conveys”.
Marium Agha said her impressions were a result of words.
Risham Syed collected ordinary images to tell stories in her work. “These for me are symbols, symbolic of the present times. I turn these symbols into paintings, which is a deliberate act of participation. Now this ‘the painting’ I juxtapose with objects that are reminiscent of a certain time in history. Past provides a context for viewing the present. Curious objects, symbols of class, power, taste, knowledge and advancement in an ordinary arrangement mimic the museum curio cabinets creating historic fictional narratives,” she said.
Based in Morocco, Safaa Erruas said the white in her work symbolises absence, immateriality, transparency, fragility and even the possible. Her work, both delicate and powerful, is characterised by the conjunction of fine and sharp materials including fabrics, cotton, paper, gauze, pearls, needles, glass and razor blades. She used the absence of colour to attract attention and communicate with the viewer.
The exhibition shall be on display and open for public viewing till Dec 20.

“This revealed that the POS system installed by Metro Shoes was made to be compromised intentionally so that transactions can be skipped from the POS real-time reporting eventually resulting into tax evasion.”
Criminal proceedings have been initiated by LTO against the proprietor of Metro Shoes under the Sales Tax Act 1990 in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Code 1898.

He said the academia can play a pivotal role in spread of awareness on the miserable conditions the Kashmiri prisoners are kept in Indian jails.
He said the United Nations was formed to ensure justice to the oppressed nations but it has badly failed in doing so.
He said the world silence over Indian steps taken after Aug 5, 2019, have totally exposed the double standards of the global community.

He said that the Parliamentary Committee on Kashmir was working to preserve, promote and protect the Kashmiri culture. He said that the successful holding of Kashmir Premier League (KPL) has proved to the world that in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, tyranny and oppression is order of the day while Azad Kashmir is a developing and thriving part of Kashmir.

8,Stars urged not to become part of tobacco industry’s tax relief campaign,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan National Heart Association (PANAH), in an open letter, has urged political personalities,...","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan National Heart Association (PANAH), in an open letter, has urged political personalities, sportsmen and showbiz stars to avoid becoming part of the tobacco industry campaign for tax relief.
In the letter it has been mentioned that prominent personalities of Pakistan, whose words count, were unknowingly becoming part of the campaign: Ab Khasara Bas Khudara which is launched by the tobacco industry.
“It is a pity that these innocent friends of ours are being provided with untrue information. And under a well-conceived conspiracy, the tobacco industry is making them part of its propaganda campaign to avoid increase in tobacco taxes, and the children of Pakistan continue to be addicted to it,” letter states.
“Now, in the name of Khasara Bus Khudara, the tobacco industry has launched a campaign justifying illegal trade, in which it was stated that the country is facing tax evasion of Rs70 billion due to illegal trade, which does not involve any credible investigation,” it stated.
Letter states that “on June 6, a report was issued stating that the illicit trade in cigarettes in Pakistan’s cities was much lower than the increase in cigarette taxes imposed on the government by the tobacco industry. The illicit trade in cigarettes in the country is less than 9pc, according to a certified research study by the Tobacco Control Journal.”
PANAH General Secretary Sanaullah Ghumman, while talking to Dawn, said that the tobacco industry used baseless propaganda in the name of illicit trade only to save itself from taxes.
“Now celebrities from reputable circles are being used because they have tens of thousands of followers and people listen to them,” he said.
“We request our friends/celebrities to pay attention to the opinions of medical and economic experts who have repeatedly stated from their experiences that Tobacco is harmful to health and is one of the major causes of many deadly diseases including heart attack and cancer.
Since Pakistan is facing an annual loss of over Rs615 billion due to health burden and more than 170,000 people lose their life every year, the opinion of health experts should be considered,” he said.

9,"Sindh govt’s policies hurting people, says Fawad","Flour and sugar prices highest in Sindh as compared to rest of the country and people are deprived of health cards, he says.","ISLAMABAD: Minister for Information and Broadcasting Chaudhry Fawad Hussain said on Thursday that Sindh was being ruled by a government that had nothing to do with the welfare of people.
Addressing a press conference along with Minister for National Food Security and Research Syed Fakhar Imam, he said the policies of the Sindh government were badly hurting the people of the province.
Flour and sugar prices were the highest in Sindh as compared to the rest of the country and people were deprived of health cards, he said, adding people were deprived of this facility due to anti-people policies of the PPP.
Flour is being sold at Rs1,100 per 20 kilogrammes in the whole country except Sindh as people of Karachi and Sindh were forced to purchase it at Rs1,460 per bag. 
The price of sugar across the country is Rs90 per kg but in Sindh it is being sold between Rs97 and Rs100, he added.
He said Transparency International’s post-Covid-19 survey was encouraging because for the first time, there was no evidence of corruption committed by the political government. 
The people of Pakistan have a government after a long time which was not accused of any type of corruption, he said, adding even the opponents of the prime minister in Pakistan believed in his uprightness.
Trust in the political government is being restored today, 89 percent people have expressed confidence on the performance and initiatives of the government after outbreak of Covid-19 which was big achievement, Mr Chaudhry said.
There were very few examples in the world where the economy was developing at 5 per cent per year after the pandemic. Our economic growth figures are also being acknowledged by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and there is likelihood that Pakistan will go beyond the 5pc growth rate, he said.
The agricultural sector due to policies of the government earned an additional amount of about Rs400 billion last year, he said, adding farmers earned Rs118 billion through sale of wheat, Rs138 billion through cotton, Rs46 billion through rice, Rs3 billion through maize and Rs96 billion through the sale of sugarcane.

12,President Alvi urges judiciary to promptly dispose of white-collar crime cases,Lauds NAB for taking action against corruption.,"ISLAMABAD: President Dr Arif Alvi on Thursday urged judiciary for prompt disposal of white-collar crime cases and that a combined action of relevant quarters could eradicate the menace of corruption from the country.
“Prompt decisions by the judiciary on the cases of corruption is required because delays caused dispensation of justice,” the president said while addressing at the seminar on ‘Corruption Free Pakistan: Pride of Nation’, held at the Presidency.
The president also stressed the need for respective roles of parliament and executive in making strict laws and their implementation to check corruption.
Terming corruption an impediment to the country’s growth, he said: “It is the collective responsibility of all tiers of the state and society to ensure its eradication. Strict laws, effective prosecution, and prompt dispensation of justice besides societal pressure are the important factors in checking corruption,” he added.
The event organised by National Accountability Bureau (NAB) was held in connection with the International Anti-Corruption Day aimed at creating awareness among the people to fight corruption in society.
President Alvi said allowing greed to take over morality results in the adoption of corrupt practices and put a detrimental impact on society. He condemned the abuse of entrusted power for private gains and emphasised self-accountability to eliminate corruption.
The president lauded NAB for taking action against corruption, however, pointed out that the efforts of the anti-corruption watchdog alone could not prove effective unless supported by all segments of society.
The president said the pressure of society, and religious and spiritual beliefs also helped a person not to get deviated from the righteous path.
He said media, through whistle-blowing about corruption, could play a positive role, however, stressed that it should be about the actual exposure of fraud rather than pursuing out-of-context journalism.
The president said Pakistan was taking effective steps against corruption and appreciated NAB for making a huge recovery of Rs821 billion. 
Speaking on the occasion NAB Chairman retired Justice Javed Iqbal said NAB was committed to ending corruption in the country and had carried out 1,194 convictions with a total recovery of Rs821 billion, including the Rs538 billion in the last four years.
He said NAB also took action against its 200 officials on charges of corruption in four years.
He mentioned that foreign anti-corruption organisations had acknowledged the efficiency of NAB and had sought training on its ‘factum of deterrence’ methodology.
Country Representative United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Jeremy Milsom said extensive work had been taken up in Pakistan to fight corruption.
By preventing corruption and returning stolen assets, he said, the UNODC was unlocking resources for growth and new jobs, building resilience to future emergencies, empowering women and young people, and laying the foundations for a fairer future.
Later, President Alvi distributed certificates of appreciation among the NAB officers who had done a commendable job in the areas of investigation and prosecution.

The walks titled: “Anti-Corruption Awareness” were organsied by the Sustainable Social Development Organisation (SSDO) on the occasion of International Anti-Corruption Day.
Addressing the gathering Excecutive Director of SSDO, Syed Kausar Abbas, said that the motive of organising this walk was to give the citizens visibity in public spaces to highlight their opinions.
“It was equally imperative for civil society organisations, youth groups and all other stakeholders to also acknowledge and organise events that promote transparency and accountability,” he said.
The SSDO mobilised citizens from an array of diverse backgrounds such as civil society organizations, members from the transgender community, journalists, lawyers, public policy professionals, students, activists and from the informal sector.
The participants carried placards articulating messages against corruption, bringing to attention the utter destruction corruption brings to society, with its far-reaching effects that destroy institutions, legal processes and public trust.
The participants raised slogans against corruption such as “Corruption free is the way to be” and “Corruption aik lanat hai [Corruption is a curse]”, to express the disdain they felt at the intense permeation of corruption into many of Pakistan’s institutions and decision-making bodies, hampering development and suppressing common citizens.
It has been decided by the participants would hold similar events in future, so that citizens could once again gather together and provide a collaborative and united front to demonstrate their power in numbers and initiate public policy dialogue.
