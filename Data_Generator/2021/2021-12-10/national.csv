The observations came during the hearing of a set of petitions seeking review of the Supreme Court’s Aug 17 judgement which rendered almost 17,000 government employees jobless.
On the eve of his retirement, Justice Mushir Alam had on Aug 17 declared as illegal and unconstitutional a PPP-era law, the Sacked Employees (Reinstatement) Ordinance Act 2010 (SERA), under which hundreds of individuals were either employed or promoted.
A five-judge SC bench, headed by Justice Umar Ata Bandial, has been hearing the petitions.

Attorney General given a ‘set of questions’, asked to address them on the next date of hearing

Raza Rabbani, who is representing the sacked employees from the Intelligence Bureau (IB) in the case, said the government was being virtually run through ordinances.
As if this were not enough, Mr Rabbani added, ordinances were not being placed before parliament — a requirement under Article 89 of the Constitution.
“It amounts to denying parliament an opportunity to reject temporary laws,” the former Senate chairman contended.
In his observations, Justice Shah said if the legislature votes against an ordinance, the law stands repealed and no protection is available under Article 264 of the Constitution, according to which the repeal of an ordinance would have no effect on any right, privilege or obligation accrued under it.
The Supreme Court gave a set of questions to Attorney General (AGP) Khalid Jawed Khan and asked him to address them on Monday (Dec 13), the next date of hearing.
The bench said its priority in the present case was to uphold a fundamental guarantee under Article 25 of the Constitution, which stipulates that all citizens are equal in the eyes of the law. The reinstatement of a “particular group of people” has created a special class of individuals in violation of Article 25, according to the bench.
The court sought the AGP’s assistance on a question whether the court could explore avenues to trim down the illegalities committed in SERA.
The questions framed by Justice Bandial required the government to explain how many of the individuals sacked through the Aug 17 judgement were government employees and how many of them were on the payroll of autonomous or semi-autonomous organisations and corporations.
The Supreme Court also wanted to know whether these employees were inducted on merit or not.
The AGP will also have to explain whether the ordinance or the Sacked Employees (Reinstatement) Ordinance Act overrides the previous decisions of the courts, including the Supreme Court, since some of the employees were reinstated or their cases rejected through previous court orders, Justice Bandial observed.
The attorney general was asked to explain what benefit these employees could claim for the period they worked for the government before their services were terminated.
On Monday, the government will have to come up with an explanation about its change of heart — when the case was being heard earlier by a bench headed by Justice Mushir Alam, the government had opposed the law, but now it was supporting it.
Earlier, senior counsel Hamid Khan, who is representing 1,121 employees of the Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC), argued that the Supreme Court had to look into the fact that a sizable number of people had suffered and to alleviate their sufferings, the legislation was brought for valid purposes.
He further argued that the court should treat the case of these employees as a “past and closed transaction” since they served for some time and then suffered for another length of time.

1,"PML-N leaders, Rangers scuffle at symbolic opening of Karachi bus project","Party claims Ahsan Iqbal, a female worker injured during baton-charge","

KARACHI: PML-N leader Ahsan Iqbal and other members of the party being stopped by the Rangers personnel from moving towards the main track of Green Line Metro project on Thursday.—PPI

 
KARACHI: Several Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) workers, led by its senior leader Ahsan Iqbal, and Rangers personnel came face to face on Thursday when the paramilitary troops prevented the former from performing ‘symbolic opening’ of the Green Line bus service at the project site, leading to brawl and scuffle between the two sides a day before Prime Minister Imran Khan is scheduled to open the much-awaited transport scheme.
It all began when a number of workers of PML-N’s Karachi chapter in line with the plan to hold a symbolic opening of the project started converging at one of the bus stations in North Nazimabad and were later joined by senior leaders, including former interior minister Ahsan Iqbal, former Sindh governor Mohammad Zubair and former federal finance minister Miftah Ismail.
Amid slogans and charged atmosphere, the PML-N leaders and workers, however, were stopped by a heavy contingent of Pakistan Rangers from advancing to the pedestrian bridge where the party had arranged a stage for the ceremony.
Led by their leaders, the PML workers faced resistance from the Rangers personnel carrying sticks. The situation turned tense when Mr Iqbal came forward and started arguing with a paramilitary officer insisting on exercising his democratic and legal rights. At this moment the scuffle between the two sides further intensified and amid slogans and noise of the workers, the paramilitary troops stopped them forcefully.

Party claims Ahsan Iqbal, a female worker injured during baton-charge

In the process, the PML-N claimed, Rangers also resorted to baton-charge that left Mr Iqbal and a female worker injured. The party workers dispersed and the ceremony was formally called off, but the PML-N leaders addressed the media at the site. They called the Rangers’ move state terrorism and demanded that the military leadership take notice of the paramilitary force’s action.
“We came here to organise a peaceful and simple symbolic opening ceremony of Green Line which everyone knows is a project of Nawaz Sharif,” said Mr Iqbal.
“But we don’t know under which law we were stopped by the Rangers. It didn’t end here. When we questioned their move, they restored to the worst state terrorism. I hope that military leadership would take notice of the Rangers action,” the PML-N leader added.
Showing brusises over his left hand due to the baton-charge, he called it political vendetta of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government which had ordered the paramilitary force to attack PML-N workers and media.
Spokesman for Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nzwaz and former Sindh governor Muhammad Zubair said the Green Line bus project was a gift from the former prime minister to Karachiites and advised PM Imran Khan that he didn’t need to visit Karachi.
“It’s a project of the PML-N and workers of the party have inaugurated this project today. You [PM Imran Khan] don’t need to come to Karachi,” he said.

2,Baloch leader Mir Yousuf Masti held for making ‘anti-state’ speech in Gwadar,Protest by the residents of port city for rights has been going on for the last 22 days.,"GWADAR: Police on Thursday arrested veteran politician and Baloch Muttahida Mahaz (BMM) president Mir Yousuf Masti Khan on the charge of making a “provocative and anti-state” speech at a protest sit-in staged by the people of Gwadar.
The residents of Gwadar have been staging the sit-in for the past 22 days in support of their demands under the banner of Gwadar ko haq do movement launched by Balochistan general secretary of Jamaat-i-Islami Maulana Hidayat-ur-Rehman.
Police registered cases against the BMM president under sections 121, 123-A, 124-A, 153, 109 and 34 of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Police arrested Yousuf Masti Khan from a hotel where he was staying and later produced him before a sessions court. The court remanded him in police custody for one day.

Protest by the residents of port city for rights has been going on for the last 22 days

The Baloch leader reached Gwadar to express solidarity with the people of Gwadar staging the protest sit-in.
The organisers of the sit-in claimed that police had also registered cases against Maulana Hidayat-ur-Rehman.
They said that police also attempted to arrest the leader of the movement but could not do so due to the presence of thousands of people at the sit-in.
A heavy contingent of police and other law-enforcement agencies was present in the sit-in area, but took no action against the participants of the protest.
Speaking at the sit-in, Maulana Hidayat-ur-Rehman, while condemning the arrest of the BMM leader, declared: “We are not afraid of arrests and attitude of Gwadar police. Our peaceful sit-in is being pushed towards violence”.
He said the people of Gwadar had decided to lay siege to the police station against the arrest of Mr Yousuf, but the decision had been postponed on the appeal of the Gwadar deputy commissioner.
“What does it mean to arrest an 80-year-old man?” the Jamaat leader asked. “We are already condemning the FC and others for violating the sanctity of chador aur chardiwari, but today Gwadar police played the role of the FC.
He said that Pervez Musharraf and other generals were violating the Constitution of the country, but they were not declared rebels and traitors.
“We are demanding a ban on foreign trawlers fishing in Balochistan’s waters and opening of border trade with Iran and Afghanistan to ensure livelihood of the people of Balochistan, but we are declared rebels and traitors by the government,” he added.
Meanwhile, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has condemned the arrest of veteran Baloch leader Yusuf Masti Khan in Gwadar.
In a statement issued here on Thursday, the HRCP said: “Mr Khan has done nothing more than demanding of the state to give Gwadar residents civil, political and economic rights to which they are entitled to.
“To charge Mr Khan under archaic and repressive colonial laws is undemocratic.
He must be released immediately and unconditionally, especially given his poor health condition.”
