0,Another suspected case of Omicron variant identified in Karachi,Patient has recovered and is under observation at Qatar Hospital.,"KARACHI: A suspected case of Omicron variant of coronavirus was reported on Friday, health department sources told Dawn.
They said the patient, a 35-year-old man, had no signs or symptoms of the illness when he arrived in Karachi from the United Kingdom on Dec 8.
They said he had apparently recovered from the illness and was currently under observation at the Qatar Hospital.
“His genome sequencing report stating that the infection appeared to be of Omicron has been sent to the National Institute of Health for further confirmation,” said an official on the condition of anonymity.

Patient has recovered and is under observation at Qatar Hospital

The passenger was suspected to have coronavirus infection in random sampling being carried out at Karachi Airport with the help of a rapid antigen test.
Source said the passenger was quarantined at an airport hotel from where he escaped on Dec 10 when his PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test of coronavirus infection came positive. His samples were sent for genome study.
“His genome sequencing report came positive on Dec 13 and subsequently a search was launched for him. He was located two days later. He is now coronavirus negative and under observation at the Qatar hospital,” he said.
About the standard operating procedure in place at the airport, health department sources said all passengers coming from Category C countries had to go through a rapid antigen test.
“In case the test comes positive, the patient is quarantined till he/she is negative. Since, we don’t have any direct flights from South Africa [which first reported the Omicron variant] right now, we check the travel history of passengers and carry out random tests.”
Pakistan had reported its first confirmed case of Omicron variant a few days back.
“The National Institute of Health, Islamabad has been able to confirm that a recently suspected sample [of a female patient] from Karachi is indeed the ‘Omicron variant’ of Sars-CoV2,” the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) had said in a tweet.
“This is the first confirmed case but continued surveillance of identified samples is in place to identify trends,” the NCOC added.
It has also allowed Pakistanis to travel inbound from category C countries; the Netherlands, Hungary, Ukraine, Ireland, Zimbabwe, Slovenia, Vietnam, Poland, Croatia, South Africa, Mozambique, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini and Botswana.

2,SHC upholds life term for mugger in murder case,Appellant had killed a Suparco employee when he resisted a robbery bid in 2016...,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court (SHC) has upheld the life term handed down by the trial court to a man for killing an employee of the Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) during an attempted robbery in 2016. 
A two-judge bench of the SHC headed by Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha dismissed an appeal of the convict against the judgement of the trial court and also turned down a revision application of the complainant party seeking enhancement of the sentence.  
An antiterrorism court had sentenced Ali Hassan to life in jail for killing driver Mohammad Idress and wounding security guard Faisal Abbas of Suparco for resisting a cash-snatching bid near the Suparco office building when they were returning with over Rs600,000 withdrawn from a bank on Sharea Faisal in July 2016. 
The convict through his lawyer challenged the conviction order before the SHC while the complainant also approached the high court, seeking enhancement of the awarded sentence. 

Appellant had killed a Suparco employee when he resisted a robbery bid in 2016

After hearing arguments and examining the record and proceedings of the case, the division bench maintained the order of the trial court and dismissed both peals. 
The bench in its order said that in the face of reliable and confidence inspiring evidence of eyewitnesses and other corroborative evidence, the prosecution proved its case against the appellant for being involved in the attempted robbery and murder. 
About the defence plea of the appellant that he was going to hospital when caught in the crossfire and implicated in the case, it observed that the convict had admitted his presence at the crime scene and also sustained three firearm injuries fired by the trained security guard and not hit by any stray shot. 
The appellant also did not give evidence under oath to disprove the case of the prosecution and remained unable to produce any evidence about his checkup at a hospital, it added. 
Regarding revision application for the enhancement of the sentence, the bench said the trial court had rightly sentenced to the appellant to the life term instead of death penalty on mitigating circumstances as it could not sure whether the appellant or his absconding accomplices fired the fatal shot which lead to the death of the victim. 
According to the prosecution, the driver and security guard along with an official of the finance department of Suparco, who was also the complainant in the case, were returning to the office after withdrawing money. Three armed men on two motorcyclists intercepted them and opened fire because the driver tried to speed away the vehicle while the security guard also retaliated that left the appellant wounded and his two accomplices managed to flee the crime scene. 
In the exchange of fire, the driver was killed while the guard sustained injuries, it added.

Addressing the workshop, SSUET Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Vali Uddin said according to the WHO data published in 2018, road traffic accidents deaths in Pakistan reached 30,046, or 2.42 per cent of the total deaths.
Pakistan stands 95 in the world in the ranking of road safety measures. The economically productive age groups (15-64 years) in Pakistan are involved in 75pc of road crash fatalities and injuries. As a result, 1,461 people got affected due to road crash injuries and suffer disabilities per 100,000 people.
He advised the road users to avoid reckless driving and also avoid using mobile phones and playing loud music during driving.
While speaking about the Karachi road safety scenario and efforts for reducing crash burden, neurology and trauma expert Prof Dr Rashid Juma said 90pc of traffic deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. A majority of road accidents are caused by careless and incautious driving, he said and advised pedestrians that they should also know the road rights and responsibilities of other road users as well. 
He further highlighted the need for policy dialogue between all stakeholders affected by road crashes.
ITS expert from NED University Dr Afzal Ahmed said public transport is safer than private transport and 52pc of total road accidents are caused by motorbike riders. A good public transport system could reduce accidents, he added.
He shared the results of using drone technology in road safety research.

In Karachi, the party staged demonstrations in all six districts where the leaders accused the PTI government of causing a human crisis by toeing the line of International Monetary Fund amid growing inflation and declining business.
In Karachi east district, Sindh Minister for Information Saeed Ghani led the protest and said in his speech that PTI government had broken a 70-year record of inflation within just three years. 
“Amid growing crisis, we recall the words of Imran Khan when he was in opposition. He used to say that inflation, rise in food prices and devaluation of rupee against US dollar in fact reflected dishonesty of sitting prime minister. We agree with his thoughts,” he said.
HYDERABAD: Senator Moula Bux Chandio, who led the protest here, said that people should take to the streets and send this government packing for back-breaking inflation.
He said the PTI government did not take advice of opposition seriously because Imran Khan was an immature politician who lacked ability to run government. Sindh and Balochistan were producing bulk of the gas still both the provinces were facing its shortage, he said. 
LARKANA: PPP Sindh president Nisar Ahmed Khuhro and political secretary to Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari Jamil Soomro led main sit-in and gathering at Jinnahbagh and said that Sindh produced major portion of gas but the government had denied it gas supply. 
They said that PTI government was imposing unconstitutional decisions on the country and advised the prime minister to read the constitution first and treat Sindh as a province of Pakistan.
They said that thanks to a ‘confused’ opposition Imran Khan had secured time to rule and accused MQM of intending to reignite ethnic hatred. 
SUKKUR: Hundreds of PPP workers took out a procession in Jacobabad against federal government’s policies and price hike.
The protesters’ leaders including PPP MPA Suhrab Sarki and others said that PTI ministers were busy boasting on TV channels that inflation was a global phenomena. 
They demanded the PTI government immediately resign. 
MIRPURKHAS: PPP workers, office bearers and legislators held a demonstration outside local press club to protest against shortage of gas and rise in inflation.
Former MNA Pir Aftab Hussain Shah Jilani, MNA Shamim Aara Panhwer, MPAs Syed Zulfikar Ali Shah and Mir Tarique Ali Khan Talpur, who led the protest, slammed the PTI government for depriving people of gas and raising its price as well.
UMERKOT: Workers of PPP staged a sit-in against federal government at Allah Wala Chowk where MPA Syed Ameer Ali Shah, adviser to chief minister advocate Poonjo Bheel and others said that gas and power loadshedding had multiplied difficulties of common man. Time had not come for the prime minister to step down, they said. 
BADIN: A large number of PPP workers led by provincial minister Mohammad Ismail Rahu, MNA Mir Ghulam Ali Talpur and others staged a sit-in at Pir Chowk on National Highway.
The leaders said that rulers had proved their anti-Sindh attitude and now people of Sindh would never trust them.
DADU: PPP activists took out a procession and marched on different roads before arriving at local press club where party leaders made speeches and slammed federal government’s ‘anti-Sindh’ policies. Similar rallies were staged in Mehar, Khairpur Nathan Shah, Johi, Sehwan, Kotri and Jams­horo.

6,Sexual assault suspect sent to jail,UMERKOT: The court of civil judge on Friday sent a suspect to jail after he confessed to subjecting an ...,"UMERKOT: The court of civil judge on Friday sent a suspect to jail after he confessed to subjecting an eight-year-old girl to sexual assault six days ago in Aadityo Water village, 10 kilometres from here.
According to police, Chandiyo Bheel snatched the victim off a street when she was returning home after buying some goodies from a grocery shop and took her to a deserted place in an empty watercourse, where he subjected her to sexual assault and then attempted to kill her. As the girl fell unconscious, the suspect though she had did and fled away, said police. 
The girl’s heirs mounted a search for her after she took too long to return and found her lying unconscious at the crime scene. She was taken to Umerkot Civil Hospital and was later referred to Hyderabad in a critical condition where she was still under treatment.
The girl’s father had registered a case against an unidentified man at Umerkot police station after which police arrested three suspects, whose samples were collected and sent to laboratory for DNA testing.
The CIA and investigation police finally succeeded to nab the main accused Chandiyo Bheel in the same village on Thursday. 
CIA In-charge Khalil Kunbhar told Dawn that they solved the case with the help of a torn off button of the suspect’s shirt found at the crime scene. They found soon that the boy had gone missing since the day the girl was assaulted and furthermore a number of villagers informed police they had noticed blood stains on the suspect’s pant that day, said the official. 
He said that after accumulating enough evidence they arrested Chandiyo and interrogated him. He had no recourse but to confess to the crime, he said.
Police produced the suspect in the court of civil judge Rasool Bux Dars where he confessed to the crime while recording his statement under section 164 CrPC and the judge sent him to jail.

7,SSGC stopped from cutting off supply to non-export industries,KARACHI: The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Friday restrained the Sui Southern Gas Company from disconnecting the supply...,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Friday restrained the Sui Southern Gas Company from disconnecting the supply of natural gas to non-export industries till Jan 11.
A single-judge bench headed by Justice Zulfiqar Ahmad Khan suspended the impugned notice issued by the SSGC on Dec 10 till the next hearing, putting the gas utility, petroleum ministry, attorney general and other defendants on notice.
In two suits filed by local industries, the plaintiffs’ lawyers submitted that their clients were leading general/non-export industries based in Karachi and other parts of Sindh.
They said the SSGC issued a notice for complete closure of gas supply to all general industries (non-export including captive power units) from Dec 11 till further notice.
They argued that the impugned notice was issued in utter violation and utmost disregard to the framework laid down by the Constitution and it also aimed at disturbing inter-provincial harmony.
They stated that such abrupt and uncertain closure of gas would not only bring the business sector to a halt, but would also result in joblessness as well as pushing the plaintiffs into defaulting on the investment made in their business.
The counsel further submitted that Sindh was producing around 72 per cent of the natural gas while total consumption of gas within the province did not exceed more than 46pc i.e., the province produced more gas than it consumed.
While referring to Article 158, they argued that the framers of the Constitution envisaged that provinces in which wellheads of natural gas were situated should have precedence over other parts of the country in meeting their own requirements of gas.
They maintained that the SHC in 2017 had declared the earlier notices of the SSGC for “Sunday closure” as illegal and ultra vires to the Constitution.
The lawyers also cited some judgements of other high courts stating that the policy about supply and distribution of natural gas came within constitutional framework.
“Contentions raised by the learned counsel merit considerations. Issue notice to the defendants as well as Attorney General for 11.01.2022, in the meanwhile the defendants are restrained from giving any effect to the impugned notice dated 10.12.2021 (annexure P-2) till the next date of hearing, as well as, they are restrained from disconnecting gas being supplied to the plaintiffs subject to payment of current monthly bills by the latter,” the bench in its order said.

8,Four get life term for aiding TTP in Perween Rahman’s murder,Court sentences fifth accused to seven years in prison for concealing evidence...,"KARACHI: An antiterrorism court on Friday sentenced four accused to life in prison on two counts for facilitating, aiding and abetting the outlawed Terheek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in assassinating renowned rights activist Perween Rahman in 2013.
The four accused — Muhammad Raheem Swati, Ayaz Shamzai, Amjad Hussain Khan and Ahmed Khan aka Ahmed Ali aka Pappu Kashmiri — were found guilty of facilitating, aiding and abetting with common intention TTP commanders Mehfuzullah alias Bhalu, who had been killed in a police encounter, and Moosa for the murder of the rights activist.
However, Swati’s son Mohammad Imran, the fifth accused, was sentenced to seven-year imprisonment on the charge of concealing evidence.
Ms Rahman, the then head of the Orangi Pilot Project (OPP) who devoted her life to the development of the impoverished neighbourhoods across the country, was gunned down near her office in Orangi Town on March 13, 2013.

Court sentences fifth accused to seven years in prison for concealing evidence

On Friday, the ATC-VII judge, who conducted the trial in the judicial complex inside the central prison, pronounce his verdict reserved after recording evidence and final arguments from both sides.
The trial took around eight years during which some five joint investigation teams were constituted by the provincial and federal governments on the directives of the Supreme Court to probe the high-profile killing.
The judge sentenced the four accused to life imprisonment ‘twice’ and ordered to pay a collective fine of Rs300,000 each. On default to payment, they would have to undergo an additional imprisonment of one year each.
The judge ruled that accused Imran, Shamzai, Hussain and Khan were found guilty of disappearing/concealing evidence of the offence. They were sentenced to seven-year imprisonment and ordered to pay Rs75,000 fine each.
However, the judge while extending them the benefit of Section 382-b (period of detention to be considered while awarding sentence of imprisonment) of the criminal procedure code ruled that all the sentences would run concurrently.
The judge noted that the overall attending circumstances and material collected by the investigation agency, the interview recorded by Ms Rahman, the confession of accused Raheem Swati and findings of the JIT supervised by the Federal Investigation Agency, established that the prosecution succeeded to unearth all such material facts of the case and accusation against the accused is well founded.
“The accused at no stage succeeded to dislodge the material placed on record; neither they failed to cause dent in the case of prosecution in any way, thus the defence agitated by the accused is hereby discarded,” the verdict reads.
The judge noted that the prosecution established that by getting Ms Rahman murdered the accused created terror, fear, a sense of insecurity and panic among the staff of the OPP and other NGOs, besides the surrounding area, to get them realise that there should be nobody to stand in their way.
The prosecution also proved that accused Imran misguided and concealed the whereabouts of his father Raheem Swati to get the investigating agency bluffed and linger on the investigations so that the evidence could not be gathered.
Complainant’s counsel Faisal Siddiqi and Salahuddin Panhwar argued that Swati in his confessional statement before SSP Akhtar Farooqui disclosed that local leaders of the Awami National Party (ANP) had hired Taliban militants to kill Ms Rahman.
The confessional statement added that Shamzai and Swati, said to be the local leaders of the ANP, were living near the OPP office and tried to obtain a designated area to build a karate centre, but Ms Rahman had refused to allow it, the counsel added.
The counsel said all the accused persons were present in a meeting held in January 2013 at Swati’s residence in which they planned Ms Rahman’s murder, adding that they hired a local TTP commander for the murder.
Special Public Prosecutors Neel Parkash and Ali Raza argued that there was sufficient evidence to establish the role of each accused with the commissioning of the offence.
On the other hand, defence counsel Shah Imroz Khan, Ajab Khan Khattak and Abid Zaman claimed innocence on the part of their clients, saying they were framed in the present case and pleaded the court to acquit them of the false and fabricated allegations.
Initially, a case was registered under Sections 302 (premeditated murder) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code at the Pirabad police station on the complaint of the victim’s sister, Aquila Ismail.
Later, Section 7 (punishment for acts of terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 was incorporated in the case on the basis of a judicial inquiry conducted by then district and sessions judge (west) Ghulam Mustafa Memon on the orders of the SC.

KARACHI: An elderly woman, who was a former resident of 15-storey Nasla Tower, died after suffering from “sheer depression,” the Association of Builders and Developers (Abad) said on Friday.
Shamim Usman, 65, was among scores of residents who were ordered by the Supreme Court to vacate their apartments in Nasla Tower so it could be demolished for partly encroaching upon the land meant for a service road.
The Abad said she was a retired employee of the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and was suffering from depression after she had forced to vacate her flat in the multi-storey building last month.
“Shamim Usman resided in flat No 104 of Nasla Tower,” said a statement. She was a retired employee of PIA who had invested all her money earned through hard work and service benefits on retirement. She was in sheer depression after she and all residents of Nasla Tower were forced to leave their homes on the order of Supreme Court.”
The demolition of Nasla Tower is currently under way and a large numer of labourers are busy in razing the building.

11,Rescued eagle released with GPS tracker reaches Balochistan,Wildlife dept had rescued two eagles in a raid on Empress Market six months ago.,"KARACHI: A female steppe eagle that received a solar-powered satellite tracking device after being rehabilitated at a private conservation facility in Karachi last month has reached Balochistan.
So far, the endangered species named ‘Sadoori’ (lucky) has travelled more than 330 kilometres and soared to a height of 460 feet.
The bird, along with its male partner ‘Sadoor’, was rescued by the wildlife department in a raid on an Empress Market shop in June this year where they were illegally caged for months.
Speaking to Dawn, Kamran Yousufzai, head of the Raptor Centre for Conservation where the eagles were shifted for rehabilitation by the wildlife department following their seizure, said the eagles were in poor condition when the team received them.
“They were injured and their feathers were broken. So, we took good care of them as they needed to be 100 per cent fit to be in the wild where their survival was directly dependent on their ability to hunt,” he said.

Wildlife dept had rescued two eagles in a raid on Empress Market six months ago

Wildlife officials collaborating with the centre decided to attach satellite tracking devices to the birds in an effort to map their movement and get information about their resting places, speed, temperature, food etc.
The devices costing Rs100,000 each were donated by the centre.
Contact with male eagle lost
“We lost contact with both of them for a few days. Luckily, it has resumed with the female recently but there is no clue to the male yet,” said Yousufzai, adding that the loss of contact might be due to some technical issues.
According to Sindh wildlife conservation official Javed Mahar, it’s the first time that a tracking device has been attached to any confiscated animal.
“The centre is communicating to us the latest information about the birds. We have lost contact with the male bird when it was flying at a height of 300 feet,” he said, hoping that the contact would resume soon.
Sharing how the experience would help conservation efforts, experts said it’s a unique experience to get real-time information about the birds’ movement, behaviour and habitat that would help build local data about these winter visitors.
“They are three years old and mature to breed. If they find a partner, they will look for nesting places and breed around June-July. In August-September, they will return to colder regions,” said Yousufzai.
Asked about the population of migratory species over the years, he said it appeared healthy but there was a need for scientific studies to have data on their population and migration pattern.
A large bird of prey, the steppe eagle (Aquila nipalensis) in many ways is a peculiar species of eagle. They are the only eagle to nest primarily on the ground. Usually, one to three eggs are laid and, in successful nests, one to two young eagles fledge.
In Pakistan, these eagles have been recorded from the lowland areas of Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh and Punjab. 
Wetlands have been reported as their preferred sites, presumably due to the abundant food supply (birds, rodents and reptiles) available there.

12,"Art, life and light","KARACHI: In a world of binaries, light symbolises life — as opposed to darkness which has negative connotations. ...","KARACHI: In a world of binaries, light symbolises life — as opposed to darkness which has negative connotations. It means it’s also a sign of cheerfulness and progress. Painters and cinematographers use light for two reasons: one, they create the right ambience for the subject being painted or screened; two, they sometimes employ it as a metaphor for something important which characters can’t fully do justice to. A two-person show titled Breathing Light that can be seen at the Koel Art Gallery has both the above-mentioned features.
The participating artists — Khadija S Akhtar and Rabia S Akhtar — are sisters. This, in a way, implies that there may be an overlap of ideas. Not at all. Both are distinctly different, content and technique-wise, and brilliant at what they do. Here’s a bit of its evidence from the statements that the gallery has provided which will help us understand the artists better. “Like water, the ebb and flow or memory remains in a state of continuous transformation. As recollections of the past are altered by contemporary circumstances, they grow increasingly fragile and precious. With this knowledge artist Khadija S Akhtar attempts to chase and re-imagine the ephemeral joy of what once was.”


‘Quiet pathways to eternity’ by Rabia S Akhtar.—Fahim Siddiqi / White Star

 
For Rabia: “As history indicates, human mythologies, language and aesthetics are shaped by our connections and interactions with the animal kingdom. Over the centuries, animal presence in visual culture demonstrates the dynamic relations between man and beast, which exist in perpetual modes of flux, simultaneously forming and disintegrating with the passage of time.” 
These are two entirely different topics: memory, which is intangible, and the man-animal relation which is tangible. The former is a singular exercise and the latter indicates a collective behaviour. And yet, they somewhere carry a degree of lamentation. For instance, memory can hurt, so can our inhuman attitude to a natural habitat. But there can be moments of mirth as well. The impressive thing is that Khadija and Rabia make their paintings with the kind of abandon that can only be driven by a consuming passion for art. This can be gauged from Khadija’s ‘Red Box’ (acrylic on canvas) and Rabia’s ‘Passing Tempest’ (gouache on wasli). And the passion illuminates — or lights up — their artworks.  
The exhibition concludes on Dec 22.
