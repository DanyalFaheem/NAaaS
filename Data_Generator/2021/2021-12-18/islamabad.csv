12 educational institutions, 27 shops closed; school owners vow to continue protests

On the other hand, All Pakistan Private Schools and Colleges Association Punjab chapter President Ilyas Kiani said sealing private educational institutions before the deadline of Dec 31 was tantamount to instigating the owners, teachers and parents to take to the streets. The cantonment authorities had earlier issued notices to the owners and directed them to shift the schools and colleges from residential areas by Dec 31.
He said the association had decided to continue its protests against the decision of the cantonment authorities to close private educational institutions in residential areas. The decision will affect four million students and 400,000 teachers across the country, he added.
On the call of the Joint Action Committee, teachers and children staged a protest demonstration in front of their institutions against the eviction of private educational institutions from cantonment residential areas on Friday.
“Peaceful protests will be recorded from 10am to 10:30am daily and protests will continue,” Ibrar Ahmed Khan, a member of the Joint Action Committee, told Dawn.
Mr Khan said the cantonment administration had started sealing hundreds of educational institutions, adding that administrations of all private institutions would show unity and continue their struggle for their rights.
Meanwhile, the Joint Action Committee met under the chairmanship of Chaudhry Nasir Mahmood. The meeting was attended by Malik Azhar Mahmood, Ibrar Ahmad Khan, Chaudhry Mohammad Tayyab, Mohammad Usman, Malik Naseem Ahmed, Mohammad Asif, Raja Naseer Ahmad Janjua, Hafiz Mohammad Basharat, Shahbaz Qamar, Chaudhry Amjad Zeb, Nadeem Shiraz and Jameel Ahmed.
The participants said the cantonment administration was misinterpreting the decision of the Supreme Court.
They demanded that the sealed educational institutions be de-sealed immediately otherwise they would be forced to take to the streets.
They also urged the chief justice of Pakistan, the chief of the army staff and the prime minister to take immediate notice of the issue.

5,"13 years on, CDA still has not announced BuP awards for land acquired for seven sectors",ISLAMABAD:  The Capital Development Authority (CDA) has failed to announce the built-up property (BuP) awards of...,"ISLAMABAD:  The Capital Development Authority (CDA) has failed to announce the built-up property (BuP) awards of seven residential sectors, land for which was acquired in 2008. 
The land awards of D-13, E-13, F-13, C-13, C-16, I-17 and H-16 were announced in 2008-9 but in a highly dubious move the CDA did not announce their BuP awards that time which resulted in the growth of houses on the land which technically belonged to the civic agency. 
Still, the CDA has failed to announce the BuP awards to get possession of the land from the locals. 
“Technically, both land and BuP awards should have been announced the same day to avoid financial loss to the CDA,” said an official. 
He said it was strange that the CDA acquired the land and kept the BuP awards pending which helped local people to construct houses on the land. 
On November 2 this year, the federal cabinet directed the CDA to announce the BuP awards of the sectors but the land directorate has so far not completed the task. 
When contacted, Director Land Afnan Alam said a survey in one of the sectors was in final stage and soon the CDA will move to other sectors. He said after completion of the survey, the CDA will announce the BuP awards. 
Asked about the delay in implementation of the cabinet’s directive, he said the CDA will comply with the directive. 
“Following the directive of the cabinet, we are going to hold balloting for the stalled E-12 sector on December 29. Meanwhile, we are also taking steps to announce the pending BuPs,” he said, adding the task required time. 
“The pending works should have been completed years ago. So, there is no fault of my team but we are taking steps to resolve the pending issues,” he said. 
In addition to the seven sectors, the BuP awards of C-14 and C-15 were announced by the CDA some years ago but the civic agency failed to issue allotment letters to people to get possession of the land. 
The federal cabinet last month also directed formation of a committee to investigate failure of the authorities to clear dues of residents whose land had been acquired by the CDA. 
According to minutes of the cabinet meeting held last month, “for immediate purpose a committee having representation of Ministry of Interior, CDA and ICT might be constituted to cause a probe regarding failure on part of the concerned authorities who violated the power of eminent domain resulting in the denial/delay of the citizens’ right to be compensated which had been acknowledged.” 
The probe would be headed by a retired judge of the high court or equivalent.  
The cabinet decided that the board of the civic agency as per section 5 of CDA Ordinance 1960 will act as the apex body for redress of grievances.

6,Low gas pressure forces people to turn to firewood in Gujar Khan,"GUJAR KHAN: Low gas pressure in urban and rural areas of Gujar Khan, Kahuta, Kallar Syedan tehsils of Rawalpindi...","GUJAR KHAN: Low gas pressure in urban and rural areas of Gujar Khan, Kahuta, Kallar Syedan tehsils of Rawalpindi district and several areas of district Jhelum hasincreased consumerdependence onwood.
According to people of theseareas, drastically low gas pressure this winter has disturbed not just kitchen budgets in their homes but their domestic routines. As per a survey conducted by Dawn, a large number of people have established make-shiftwoodcutting stalls as theunprecedentedsurge in the demand forwood has increased which will most definitely accelerate deforestation.
Consequently, elimination of trees on a massive scale is going to reverse the government’s objective of a clean and green Pakistan, a number of conscientious residents pointed out.
Gul Sher Khan said that he was doing good business this year, adding, consignments ofwoodfrom Chakwal, Jhelum and Gujar Khan regions were being broughtat these open air stalls and being sold at Rs500 to Rs600 per mound. He said office going customers, whose gas-fitted kitchens haveturned cool were main customers at the stalls. Zahid Mehmood, a resident of Thakra Mohra village who was there to buy wood, said the roof of his house has turned black with smoke from burning wood but he was left with no other option as he cannot afford a liquified petroleum gas (LPG) cylinder, which costs around Rs2,400.
Another consumer, Mohammad Bashir said that he had no option but to buywood forcooking. He said that his children had to go to school and he himself was an office going employee and cooking breakfast and other meals had become impossible without burningwood. He also disclosed that he had resorted to covert means of using a compressor to get sui gas into his kitchen but everyone around was using this device and it was just like pumping empty air into the kitchen so the ultimate source to fall back upon was wood,a primitive source of fire.
Residents of Daultala town said their town was in the vicinity of one of Pakistan’s major gas producing oil and gas fields yet they were not getting sui gas in their homes. They urged elected representatives of their areas to highlight the issue. They said that they would resort to protests if this situation persisted.
According to another survey by Dawn, most of the peopleliving in the rural settings who cannot afford wood and LPG cylinders have started to use cattle waste to cook meals. This used to be an old practice among villagers but the method was abandoned after gas connections were installed in their houses, however, they have resorted to it again. Many who do not have their own cattle have started purchasing cattle waste.On the other hand, people living in urban areas are using the same means to produce fire in their homes as LPG cylinders are costly amid skyrocketing inflation.

RCCI President Nadeem Rauf in a statement said the government, in order to meet the conditionalities of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), is preparing a Rs360 billionmini-budget by imposing 17pc sales tax on about 140 essential consumable and industrial goods, in addition to increasing the income tax rates on phone calls by 50pc.
Terming it a negative move, he said the mini-budget would further increase the cost of doing business, give rise to inflation, badly affect the business growth and damage the confidence of potential investors. 
The prices of goods, including milk, cereals, bakery items, meat, chicken, gold, bicycles, cars including electric cars, mobile phones will rise, unleashing another wave of inflation in the country, he added.
He said the major chunk of the revenue, around Rs300 billion will be generated by slapping 17pc tax at the import stage on nearly 80 items. The majority of these items are essential goods and do not fall in the category of luxury goods.
He further added that it was very unfortunate that the government was imposing 17pc GST on raw materials of the medicines, this will add more misery and might create unrest in the society.
He said that a 17pc sales tax is being imposed on the import of machinery for renewable energy including solar, wind and nuclear power generation. 
This is contradicting the government’s policy on renewable energy as well as contrary to the global direction.

According to sources, a simple ceremony of acquiring the flight simulator was held in Islamabad on Monday which was attended by the United Kingdom’s ambassador in Pakistan, regional director of L3 company and secretary aviation.
The PIA had signed an agreement with L-3 UK Ltd to provide an A320 flight simulator for pilots’ training. Currently the national flag carrier operates 11 Airbus A 320 aircraft, while that number of A320 aircraft is expected to increase to 15 by April 2022.
The usage of a simulator for Pakistani airline pilots would result in safer training and cost savings for the operators, as the airlines had to spend a significant amount of money to train their pilots overseas.
When a pilot was sent abroad for training, a representative from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) accompanied him, which cost the airline. 
However, after the acquisition of a simulator by the airline, it will be able to save a large amount of money.
The multimillion-dollar of A320 simulator will also assist the PIA in imparting training to pilots from other countries. It is most likely to be installed at PIA’s training centre Jinnah International Airport.
The purchase of a simulator, according to sources, will be a landmark achievement for the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA).
A senior aviation official of aviation said that flight simulators were so accurate that a student pilot can learn to fly from scratch in the virtual world. It makes the training of pilots efficient and affordable and important to train student pilots.
He said that training pilots is costly and time consuming, so a simulator would be an efficient and affordable solution to the looming pilot shortage and training.
