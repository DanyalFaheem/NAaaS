It comes as the country is mired in economic crisis and faces a looming humanitarian catastrophe that the United Nations has called an “avalanche of hunger”. 
Finance ministry spokesman Ahmad Wali Haqmal did not disclose the size of the draft budget — which runs until December 2022 — but said it would go to the cabinet for approval before being published. 
“We are trying to finance it from our domestic revenues — and we believe we can,” he told state television in an interview shared on Twitter. 
Global donors suspended financial aid when the Taliban seized power in August and Western powers also froze access to billions of dollars in assets held abroad. 
The 2021 budget, put together by the previous administration under IMF guidance, projected a deficit despite 219 billion Afghanis ($2.7 billion at the time) in aid and grants and 217bn from domestic revenue. 
At that time, the exchange rate was around 80 Afghanis to the dollar, but the local currency has been hammered since the Taliban’s return to power, particularly in the past week, slumping to 130 on Monday before recovering on Friday to around 100. 
Haqmal accepted that public servants are still owed several months of wages, saying “we are trying our best” to make good on overdue pay by year-end. 
He warned, however, a new pay scale had also been prepared. The new government’s revenue department said last month that it had collected 26bn Afghanis in the previous two and a half months, including 13bn in customs duties.  It also announced a new ‘Islamic tax’ to fund aid projects for poor people and orphans. An Afghan economist who asked not to be named said on Friday the new budget would likely end up being only a quarter of that for 2021.

1,Arson suspected in Japan clinic blaze with 27 feared dead,"The fire was largely extinguished within 30 minutes, reports state broadcaster.","OSAKA: At least 27 people were feared dead after a fire swept through a psychiatry clinic in the Japanese city of Osaka on Friday, and police were investigating possible arson after reports a man had spilled liquid that fuelled the blaze.
The fire broke out at the clinic on the fourth floor of an office building in a busy district of the western city at around 10am, public broadcaster NHK said.
A man who looked to be in his 50s or 60s was seen carrying a bag filled with liquid into the building, where he set it down near a heater and knocked it over, spilling the liquid and starting the fire, Kyodo News reported.
Other media said the man was believed to be a patient of the clinic and that he carried a bag leaking liquid into the reception area before the fire started.
“Most of the people who lost their lives could be medical workers or patients at the clinic. This is unbearable,” Yumiko Inoue, a doctor from a nearby hospital, told Reuters as she looked up at the building’s charred windows from across the street.
Twenty-four people were confirmed dead, NHK said. An official at Osaka city’s fire department earlier told Reuters that 27 people had suffered from cardiopulmonary arrest, the term used in Japan before a death is officially confirmed.
The fire was largely extinguished within 30 minutes, according to NHK, after engulfing a narrow, 20-square metre room. Footage showed smoke pouring out of the windows of the building’s fourth floor and roof.
Police had set up a special team to investigate whether it was arson, NHK said. It was not clear if the man had also died in the blaze.
Located in a shopping and entertainment district not far from Osaka’s main train station, the building also houses a beauty salon, a clothing shop and an English-language school, NHK said.
“People who are struggling with illness have suffered this out of the blue,” said 37-year-old Yukari Tanaka, speaking to Reuters not far from the fire-stricken building.  “It makes me feel very sad to think about their situation and their families.”

2,US Senate approves setting up Afghan war commission,"A previous version of the bill also proposed probing Pakistan’s role in the Afghan war, but that provision has now been dropped.","WASHINGTON: The US Senate approved a defence bill on Friday, which calls for establishing an independent commission to scrutinise the Afghan war and to probe options for combating terrorism in the region, including Pakistan.
The proposed 16-member Afghanistan War Commission will produce a report within three years. The members would be selected in equal measure by Republican and Democratic lawmakers. Current and former members of Congress dating to 2001, as well as Cabinet-level and high-ranking defence officials involved in planning US policies on Afghanistan are excluded.
A previous version of the bill also proposed probing Pakistan’s role in the Afghan war, but that provision has now been dropped.
The commission, however, can examine how regional countries influenced the Afghan war and the role they can play in peacefully ending the Afghan conflict.
The summary of the bill states that the bipartisan panel will “examine” the 20-year conflict and will prepare “in-depth” reports on the US ability to counter terrorism in the Pakistan-Afghanistan region.
The commission will also do the “accountability” of the military equipment left in Afghanistan after the US withdrawal and will devise plans for evacuating American citizens and “Afghan allies” still there.
The defence authorisation bill — passed with 88 to 11 votes in the Senate — approved a record $770 billion for America’s defence. It earned the support of more than 80 per cent of the House last week. In both chambers, Republicans supporting the bill outnumbered Democrats, although Democrats control both the House and Senate.
Underlining America’s continued focus on China, the bill includes $7.1bn for the Pacific Deterrence Initiative and a statement of congressional support for the defence of Taiwan that Beijing claims as its own territory. It also includes a ban on the US Department of Defence procuring products made with forced labour in China’s western Xinjiang region.
The bill includes $300 million for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which provides support to Ukraine’s armed forces, $4bn for the European Defence Initiative and $150m for Baltic security cooperation.

3,EU regulator rejects Biogen’s Alzheimer drug,Notes the link between the effect and clinical improvement in the disease had not been established.,"AMSTERDAM: The European Union’s drug regulator on Friday rejected Biogen Inc’s controversial Alzheimer’s drug, Aduhelm, dealing a blow to the US drug maker after a panel voted against the treatment last month.
The drug, the first new treatment for the memory-robbing disease in nearly 20 years, has been battling slow uptake since its approval in the United States in June as experts have questioned the rationale for greenlighting it without more definitive proof of benefit.
Aduhelm works by removing sticky deposits of a protein called amyloid beta from the brains of patients in earlier stages of Alzheimer’s in order to stave off its ravages.
The European Medicines Agency noted that although Aduhelm reduced amyloid beta in studies, the link between this effect and clinical improvement in the disease had not been established.
The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company’s shares fell 4.2% in premarket trading on the news. Biogen said in a statement it would seek a re-examination of the agency’s opinion.
The results from the main studies of the drug were conflicting and did not show that Aduhelm was effective in treating adults with early stage Alzheimer’s, the EMA said.

4,Iran nuke talks adjourn as pause disappoints Europeans,"Participants said they aim to resume quickly, though they haven’t yet firmed up a date.","VIENNA: Talks aimed at salvaging Iran’s tattered 2015 nuclear deal with world powers adjourned on Friday to allow the Iranian negotiator to return home for consultations after a round marked by tensions over new demands from Tehran.
European diplomats said it was a disappointing pause and that negotiators in Vie­nna are rapidly “reaching the end of the road”. How­ever, they did point to some technical progress so far.
Participants said they aim to resume quickly, though they haven’t yet firmed up a date. China’s chief negotiator, Wan Qun, said the talks will resume hopefully before the end of the year. Enrique Mora, the European Union diplomat who chaired the talks, echoed that, saying: “I hope it will be during 2021.”
The current talks in Vienna among the remaining signatories to the 2015 nuclear agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA opened on Nov 29, after more than five months, a gap caused by the arrival of a new government in Iran. There was also a short break last week as delegations returned home to consult with their governments.
The United States has participated indirectly in the ongoing talks because it withdrew from the accord in 2018 under then-President Donald Trump. President Joe Biden has signalled that he wants to re-join the deal.

5,British PM under fire after by-election disaster,Conservative Party faces crushing defeat in a constituency never previously lost by it.,"SHREWSBURY: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday faced questions about his leadership after weeks of controversy culminated in a crushing by-election defeat in a constituency never previously lost by his Conservative Party.
His ruling Tories had held the seat in North Shropshire, central England, by a massive majority just two years ago, but saw that wiped out by the Liberal Democrats in a vote on Thursday, a historic defeat set to intensify the mutinous mood among Conservative MPs.
Johnson, 57, was already reeling from a series of scandals and setbacks and around 100 of his lawmakers rebelled in parliament Tuesday against the government’s introduction of vaccine passes for large events.

Conservative Party faces crushing defeat in a constituency never previously lost by it

The UK leader’s authority has also been hit repeatedly in recent weeks by claims of corruption and reports that he and his staff broke coronavirus restrictions last Christmas, while a new surge in Omicron cases have added to a sense of crisis.
The government reported nearly 89,000 new infections Thursday, the second consecutive record daily tally.
The Tories lose the safe rural seat, won by 23,000 votes in 2019, by almost 6,000 votes, as the Lib Dems mustered a swing of 34 percentage points — the seventh biggest in by-election history.
“The people of North Shropshire have spoken on behalf of the British people,” winning candidate Helen Morgan said in her victory speech.
“They have said loudly and clearly: ‘Boris Johnson, the party is over’.
“Your government, run on lies and bluster, will be held accountable. It will be scrutinised, it will be challenged and it can and will be defeated.”
The shattering defeat drew an immediate backlash from some Tory MPs and predictions that letters of no-confidence in their leader could be dispatched to trigger an internal party vote to remove him.
The same process saw his predecessor Theresa May ousted in mid-2019 after MPs, including Johnson, voted against her Brexit deal in parliament.
“The Conservative Party has a reputation for not taking prisoners. If the prime minister fails, the prime minister goes,” long-serving lawmaker Roger Gale told BBC Radio.
“Mr Johnson has to prove that he’s capable of being a good prime minister and at the moment it’s quite clear that the public don’t think that that’s the case.” However, others cautioned that surging Covid infections could buy the prime minister time to turn around his fortunes.
“It doesn’t meant the end, and it certainly doesn’t mean leadership challenges,” said Charles Walker, the vice-chairman of the party’s 1922 Committee which collates no-confidence letters and manages any leadership contest.
“The Conservative Party is not going to have a leadership challenge as we are heading into potential further restrictions around Covid, and difficulties around Covid.” Party chairman Oliver Dowden, also a government minister without portfolio, said North Shropshire’s voters were “fed up and they gave us a kicking” but that “we’ve heard that loud and clear”.
“The prime minister is an electoral asset for the Conservative Party,” he insisted to Sky News.
“On the big calls, (he) has the vision and the direction to get us through this difficult period.”
The atmosphere before the North Shropshire vote was a far cry from May, when the Conservatives swept to their own unprecedented by-election victory in the northeast England seat of Hartlepool on the back of a successful vaccine rollout.
But the virus is once again dominating British life and the arrival of the Omicron variant has again deepened the gloom before Christmas, just when the prime minister’s authority has been weakened.
Britain is also suffering spiralling inflation as a result of big borrowing during lockdowns, high energy prices and bottlenecked supply chains. Tax rises also loom from next April.

6,Russia sets out tough demands for security pact with Nato,Nato official says any dialogue with Moscow will also need to address Nato’s concerns about Russia’s actions.,"MOSCOW: Russia on Friday published draft security demands that Nato deny membership to Ukraine and other former Soviet countries and roll back the alliance’s military deployments in Central and Eastern Europe, bold ultimatums that are almost certain to be rejected by the US and its allies.
The proposals, which were submitted to the US and its allies earlier this week, also call for a ban on sending US and Russian warships and aircraft to areas from where they can strike each other’s territory, along with a halt to Nato military drills near Russia.
The demand for a written guarantee that Ukraine won’t be offered membership already has been rejected by the West, which said Moscow doesn’t have a say in Nato’s enlargement.
The Nato secretary-general responded on Friday by emphasizing that any security talks with Moscow would need to take into account Nato concerns and involve Ukraine and other partners. The White House similarly said its discussing the proposals with US allies and partners, but notes that all countries have the right to determine their future without outside interference.
The publication of the demands contained in a proposed Russia-US security treaty and a security agreement between Moscow and Nato comes amid soaring tensions over a Russian troop build-up near Ukraine that has raised fears of an invasion. Moscow has denied it has plans to attack its neighbour, but is seeking legal guarantees precluding Nato expansion and deploying weapons there.
Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Russia’s relations with the US and Nato have approached a dangerous point, noting that alliance deployments and drills near Russia have raised unacceptable threats to its security.
Moscow wants the US to start talks immediately on the proposals in Geneva, he told reporters.
Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance had received the Russian documents, and noted that any dialogue with Moscow would also need to address Nato’s concerns about Russia’s actions, be based on core principles and documents of European security, and take place in consultation with Nato’s European partners, such as Ukraine.
He added that the 30 Nato countries have made clear that should Russia take concrete steps to reduce tensions, we are prepared to work on strengthening confidence building measures.

7,Giant Swedish Yule goat torched again after five-year respite,STOCKHOLM: A giant straw Yule goat in the Swedish town of Gavle was set ablaze on Friday for the first time in five...,"STOCKHOLM: A giant straw Yule goat in the Swedish town of Gavle was set ablaze on Friday for the first time in five years, reviving a long-running tradition of locals illegally attempting to torch it and authorities scrambling to stop them.
Police said they had arrested a man in his 40s who witnesses said had been acting suspiciously before the blaze in the early hours of Friday.
The Gavle Yule goat, a 42-foot high statue made of wood and straw erected every year before Christmas, has become famous nationwide since one was first installed on a town square in 1966 as a marketing ploy. It was burned down on New Year’s Eve that year.
Small Yule goats made of straw are traditionally placed around Swedish homes during the festive season. Their origin has been traced to ancient pagan festivals.
The Gavle Yule goat, which features in the Guinness Book of Records, is famed not for its size but for the often elaborate schemes dreamt up to destroy it.
Authorities over the years have hired guards and deployed around-the-clock video surveillance and vast quantities of flame retardant to protect the statue, but it has been torched or otherwise destroyed at least 35 times.
Two assailants — one dressed as Santa Claus and one as a gingerbread man — set it on fire with bows and burning arrows in 2005. The culprits were never caught.
It has also been run over by cars, set ablaze by fireworks and simply smashed with clubs. The webcam has been hacked and the local tourism administration says there was once a botched plan to kidnap it using a helicopter.
British bookies have even offered betting on the likelihood of it surviving the festive season.
