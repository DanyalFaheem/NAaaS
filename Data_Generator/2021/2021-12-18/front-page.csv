• Dissenting Justice Mansoor urges judiciary to recognise central role of legislature    
ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Friday reinstated sacked government employees in their positions from Aug 17, causing the employees, who had gathered on Constitution Avenue, to heave a sigh of relief and disperse while raising slogans in favour of the judiciary.  
With a majority of four to one, the five-judge bench threw away petitions seeking review of the Aug 17 judgement that had rendered almost 16,000 government employees jobless though it restored the employees with conditions.   
On the eve of his retirement, Justice Mushir Alam on Aug 17 had declared as illegal and unconstitutional a PPP-era law called the Sacked Employees (Reinstatement) Ordinance Act 2010 (SERA) under which a number of people were employed or promoted.  
However, Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah in his note of dissent accepted the petitions and reinstated the employees with certain conditions while emphasising that parliamentary sovereignty or legislative supremacy was the cornerstone of a strong democracy and therefore the judiciary must recognise the central role of the legislature.  
The short order, the reasons of which will come later, was announced by Justice Umar Ata Bandial in a packed to capacity Courtroom No. 1.   
Outside the Supreme Court premises a large number of the employees and their family members, including women and children, spent the previous chilly night in the hope that the dawn may herald some good news for them. And they took a sigh of relief when they were told about the verdict by their fellow members.   
The majority judgement dismissed the petitions and held the Sacked Employees (Reinstatement) Act, 2010 to be violative of Article 25 (equality of citizens), 18 (that ensures freedom of trade, business or profession, 9 (security of person) and 4 (rights of individuals to be dealt with in accordance with the law) of the Constitution. “Thus the SERA is void under Article 8 (laws inconsistent with or in derogation of the fundamental rights to be void),” the short order said.  
Invoking the original jurisdiction under Article 184(3) of the Constitution read with Article 187, the court while considering the services rendered by the reinstated employees held that the employees who were holding posts on the date of their initial termination of service -- from Nov 1, 1996 to Oct 12, 1999 -- did not require any aptitude, scholastic or skill test for appointment and they would be reinstated from the date of the judgement under review (Aug 17) in their posts on the same terms and conditions of service applicable on the date of their termination pursuant to the Aug 17 verdict.  
Likewise, the employees who require the passing of any aptitude, scholastic or skill test for appointment will also be reinstated from Aug 17 in their posts on the same terms and conditions of service applicable on the date of their termination.

The majority judgement however emphasised that any improvement in the terms and conditions of service of all the reinstated employees would be granted strictly in accordance with the laws and rules.  
The short order made it clear that the relief of reinstatement will not be given to those employees whose were sacked on grounds of absence from duty, misconduct, corruption, misappropriation of money/stock or unfitness on medical grounds if such termination was not set aside finally by a court of law.  
Meanwhile, in his note of dissent, Justice Mansoor Shah emphasised that the parliamentary sovereignty or legislative supremacy was the cornerstone of a strong democracy. “We must, therefore, recognize the central role of the legislature,” he observed adding that undermining the legislature undermined democracy.  
Justice Shah observed that both the legislature and the judicature must play their role in the spirit of profound respect for each other and within the limits set out in the constitution. “The rule of law is not merely public order, it is social justice based on public order,” Justice Shah observed adding that the law existed to ensure proper social life by balancing the needs of the society and the individual and the courts must protect this rich concept of rule of law.  
Under Article 8 of the Constitution, any law enacted by the legislature was void only to the extent it took away or abridged fundamental rights of the people, Justice Shah explained.  
The minority judgement of Justice Shah accepted the review petitions and held as ultra vires Sections 4(a) and 10 of the SERA to the extent of reinstatement and regularisation on “one scale higher,” which gave an undue advantage to the reinstated employees to the detriment of the rights of the already working regular employees and thus violated their fundamental rights.  
The provisions of these sections, except the words “one scale higher,” would however remain operative with effect from the date of enactment of the SERA and be read to mean the reinstatement and regularisation in the same or restructured scale, grade, cadre, group, post or designation, Justice Shah wrote.  
According to the judgement, sections 2(f)(vi), 11, 12 and 13, which deal with and provide for reinstatement and regularisation of the sacked employees who had been dismissed from service on account of absence from duty, misconduct, misappropriation of government money or stock, or unfitness on medical grounds, and the determination of their guilt or medical unfitness attained finality by being unchallenged or unsuccessfully challenged. Such employees fall outside the class of sacked employees who suffered “political victimisation,” envisaged by the SERA for a beneficial treatment, and they by themselves do not constitute a distinct class having an intelligible differentia, which bears a reasonable relation to the object and purpose of the SERA.  
All employees whose service was terminated on the basis of the judgement under review stand restored in the service with effect from the date they were so terminated and will be paid the pay of the intervening period treating the period as an extraordinary leave with pay.  
The cases decided by the judgement under review, which now stands recalled, will be deemed pending and decided on their own merits by the regular benches of the Supreme Court in accordance with the provisions of the SERA.

1,PM Imran testifies online in case against PML-N leader Khawaja Asif,Demands Rs10bn damages for Shaukat Khanum Memorial Trust’s fund misappropriation allegations.,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Friday testified before an additional district and sessions judge through video link from his office in a defamation suit he had filed against Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Khawaja Mohammad Asif nine years ago. 
While recording his statement before the digitally connected court, which was presided over by additional district and sessions judge Mohammad Adnan, Prime Minister Khan said the allegations levelled by the PML-N leader about misappropriation of and money laundering through the funds of Shaukat Khanum Memorial Trust (SKMT) caused a loss of at least Rs10 billion to him. 
Mr Asif had made the allegations at a press conference at Punjab House before repeating them in the evening during a TV programme. 
In his suit, PM Khan referred to the August 1, 2012 press conference at which the PML-N leader had alleged that PTI chief had lost in ‘real estate gambling’ a huge amount of fund donated to the SKMT in the form of Zakat, Fitrana or other kinds of donations. 

Demands Rs10bn damages for SKMT’s fund misappropriation allegations  

Terming the allegations “false and defamatory”, the PM said decisions on the SKMT hospital’s investment schemes were made by an expert committee without his interference. 
During his presser, the PML-N leader had stated that $4.5 million funds of SKMT had been invested abroad. 
“If the investment was safe, then why Mr Khan had not invested his own money in the ventures,” wondered Mr Asif, demanding a response from him to clear the allegations. 
In his plea, Mr Khan contended that the PML-N leader had made false statements “deliberately and maliciously” intended to cause harm to his reputation within and outside Pakistan. The plea mentioned that Mr Asif during the presser had compared petitioner with “Double Shah”, a notorious fraudster who had deprived people of their hard-earned savings by extracting funds on the basis of false representations. 
While testifying before the court through a video link from his office, the PM on Friday stated he was the biggest individual donor of the SKMT from 1991 to 2009 and the investments, against which allegations had been made, were fully recovered by the SKMT without any loss. 
Senator Waleed Iqbal, counsel for the premier, was present in the courtroom. 
Mr Khan through an affidavit stated that fabricated and baseless allegations were used to undermine the confidence of the people in the SKMT. “I conservatively estimate that, for purpose of money compensation, the extent of the damage, injury and loss caused to me due to above-mentioned defamatory statements by the defendant [Khawaja Asif] is Rs10 billion. As a result of the false, misleading and highly defamatory statements made by the defendant, a large segment of the population was misled into believing these false allegations. Many people contacted me and others entrusted with the affairs of SKMT, and expressed their reservations and concerns,” the affidavit said. 
“The SKMT donors started seeking clarifications from me regarding the allegations. These false and defamatory statements lowered my reputation in the estimation of many people, who were misled into believing these statements…it created doubt in the minds of people about my financial integrity and the dealings of SKMT,” added Mr Khan’s affidavit. 
PM Khan apprised the court that the SKMT was running a “unique and the only free cancer treatment hospital” in the world. “It is unfortunate to make baseless and fabricated allegations against a welfare body,” he added. 
He expressed confidence that the court would pass an exemplary verdict on the baseless case and set a precedent.

2,FM urges world to revisit policy of shunning Taliban,ISLAMABAD: Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Friday warned of catastrophic consequen­ces if the world failed...,"ISLAMABAD: Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Friday warned of catastrophic consequen­ces if the world failed to assist the struggling Afgh­ans and called upon the international community to revisit the policy of not engaging with the Taliban regime.  
Mr Qureshi was talking to journalists at the Foreign Office ahead of the 17th extraordinary session of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation’s (OIC) Council of Foreign Ministers (CFM) that begins in Islamabad on Saturday with the senior officials’ meeting. The foreign ministers would meet on Sunday.  
A delegation of the Taliban government led by its foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi will also attend the meeting.  
The CFM meeting is being held to discuss rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation in Afghanistan and formulate a strategy for providing humanitarian assistance to it.  
United Nations’ agencies estimate that nearly 22.8 million Afghans face crisis level hunger. The World Food Programme has, furthermore, warned that 3.2m children are at the risk of acute malnutrition.  
The humanitarian crisis caused by years of conflict and drought in Afghanistan has been exacerbated by economic sanctions and freezing of $9.5 billion of Afghan reserves by the United States following the Taliban takeover.  
“If immediate attention is not paid to the humanitarian crisis and the country collapses economically, there could be the biggest humanitarian crisis in the world and all progress made over the past 20 years could be reversed,” Mr Qureshi said.  
Missing this opportunity to help Afghans, he said, would lead to exodus of refugees, instability and increased terrorism threat, which would affect not only Afghanistan’s immediate neighbours but also other countries, especially the West.  
The participants of the conference, besides, expressing solidarity with Afghanistan are also expected to make pledges of financial and in-kind support. Pakistan, which has been the biggest proponent of world’s engagement with the Taliban, wants the conference to develop “a comprehensive and concerted political approach” to the Afghanistan crisis.  
The foreign minister asked the world to revisit its approach of disengagement with the Taliban and weigh the benefits of engaging with the group that currently controls the entire Afghan territory, but lacks international recognition.  
He said that he was already seeing signs of an impending thaw between international community and the Taliban regime. “We have travelled to a certain extent from Aug 15 (when Taliban took over Kabul),” he said.  
International community engaging with the Taliban on humanitarian assistance, Mr Qureshi emphasised, was the need of the hour.  
On the absence of banking channels and sanctions complicating the relief efforts, the foreign minister said a special financial vehicle should be developed to transfer relief money to Afghanistan.  
This is one the major expectations from the conference.  
The foreign minister asked the OIC to help Afghanistan reboot its financial system, build capacity, and achieve stability.  
Arrivals 
Delegations have begun arriving in the federal capital for attending the OIC CFM session.  
OIC Secretary General Hissein Brahim Taha, after reaching here on Friday, said it was high time to think how Muslim countries could help their Afghan brethren at this critical juncture.  
He later met with FM Qureshi at the Foreign Office.  
President of the Islamic Development Bank Dr Mohammad Sulaiman Al-Jasser, on reaching Islamabad, said participation of OIC ministers in the conference was an expression of their resolve for peace in Afghanistan and Afghan people would soon get the fruits of peace.  
Besides OIC members and observers, the Foreign Office said, the UN system, international financial institutions, international and regional organisations and non-OIC members, including P-5 countries, European Union and countries like Japan, and Germany have also been invited.

3,ECC okays Rs106bn food subsidy to help 20m families,"The programme will be implemented in Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan.","ISLAMABAD: The Eco­nomic Coordination Commi­ttee (ECC) of the cabinet approved an amount of Rs106.1 billion on Friday to subsidise three essential food items — flour, pulses and cooking oil or ghee. 
The subsidy — to be available for six months from Jan 1 to June 30 at registered grocery shops — is likely to benefit at least 20 million families. 
At a meeting chaired by Federal Minister for Econo­mic Affairs Omar Ayub Khan, the committee appro­ved the Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety (PASS) division’s Ehsaas Rashan Riayat (ration concession) subsidy programme. 
The programme will be implemented in Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan. Sindh and Balochistan have declined to be part of the targeted subsidy programme. 
According to official estimates, out of the total programme’s budget of Rs106.012bn, the federal government’s share was supposed to be Rs46.987bn. However, after the exclusion of Sindh and Balochistan, the federal share would come in at Rs32.055bn. 
Special Assistant on Social Protection and Poverty Alleviation Dr Sania Nishtar told Dawn that the programme would mainly benefit families and registered retailers. She said talks over the implementation of the programme were at advanced stages with Sindh and Balochistan. 
The programme will cover subsidies for beneficiaries, incentives for kiryana stores (small- and mid-sized mom-and-pop groceries), SMS charges for telecom operators, verification charges to the Pakistan Mobile Number Portability Database company, and National Database and Registration Authority, mobilisation charges, National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) costs, and other operational expenditures. 
Under the programme, a subsidy of Rs1,000 a month will be granted to 20m eligible families on the purchase of flour, pulses and cooking oil. The subsidy amount will be Rs22 per kg on flour, Rs55 per kg on pulses, and Rs105 per litre on cooking oil or ghee, Ms Nishtar said. 
Ms Nishtar said individuals are being registered online against their CNICs through a toll number 8171. Each person’s data will be verified through the Ehsaas National Socio-Economic Registry Survey to identify deserving cases. The drive will continue until Dec 30, and those finalised will be informed through an SMS on their registered mobile numbers. 
A similar registration exercise is under way for kiryanas. It will be mandatory for these grocery stores to have a bank account to avail the programme. Ms Nishtar said the authorised grocery merchants who have bank accounts would install a mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) application on their cell phones to track the eligibility of eligible buyers and pass on the subsidy. 
She said the subsidy programme on utility stores would continue but the focus would be on mPOS, which has a wider reach to the public. 
According to the Kiryana Incentive Scheme, approved by the ECC, stores located in communities with an average monthly income of less than Rs30,000 per family will be registered for the targeted subsidy. Ms Nishtar said it would be an indicative benchmark for selecting the right stores to avail the incentives and avoid misuse of the facility. 
Under the scheme, a subsidy amount of eight per cent of the transaction value will be offered to these registered stores as commission so that shopkeepers and sellers are encouraged to serve more and more beneficiaries under the programme. 
An ECC announcement said that in pursuance of the cabinet’s decisions, extensive efforts were undertaken, including field visits, market surveys, and meetings with local shop owners and traders’ associations in several cities. 
In addition, wide-ranging consultations were held with relevant provincial and federal stakeholders. Resultantly, the program design document has been amended to ensure compliance with the cabinet’s decisions and address the concerns of stakeholders. 
Further, the PASS division and the NBP have also started mobilising efforts to register beneficiaries and merchants. 
To implement this program, the PASS division will sign a memorandum of understanding with the NBP and will reimburse all relevant costs incurred by the bank on a monthly basis, subject to an independent audit and authorisation by the programme’s steering committee. 
The PASS division will hire one of the top accounting firms as an external auditor to review all transactions, including subsidy and vendor payments, processed on a monthly basis. The three items covered under the program are essential commodities with inelastic demand, and therefore the adoption of local prices will be allowed for the disbursement of the fixed per-unit subsidy.

4,"Govt team attacks Shehbaz, family over FIA probe",PML-N claims Shahzad Akbar planning to flee abroad.,"LAHORE: The federal government on Friday deployed a battery of its spokespersons in an effort to draw attention to the alleged corruption of Opposition Leader in the National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif and his family after the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) submitted a challan a few days ago against the junior Sharif and his sons for allegedly laundering Rs16 billion in the sugar scam case. 
Firing a salvo from Lahore, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Accountability and Interior Shahzad Akbar said Shehbaz and family “captured” state institutions and misused them to launder over Rs16bn. 
“After capturing state institutions, those sitting in high political offices committed crimes that landed Pakistan on the Financial Action Task Force grey list,” Mr Akbar claimed while speaking at a presser here. 
He said the FIA challan contained 43,000 documents of evidence over seven volumes and over 100 witnesses were also available against Shehbaz. 
“The challan clearly explains that Shehbaz Sharif is the ringleader and mastermind of mega money laundering with Hamza Shehbaz, Salman Shehbaz and others as his accomplices who laundered Rs16bn through 28 secret benami accounts during his chief ministership spanning 10 years,” he said. 

PML-N claims Shahzad Akbar planning to flee abroad 

The adviser said the family had opened bank accounts in the names of low-paid employees of Ramzan Sugar Mills and all the money transferred and laundered through these accounts had nothing to do with the sugar business. 
Providing details of the low-paid employees, Mr Akbar cited an example of the bank account of a peon, Gulzar Ahmad Khan, wherein one Aurangzeb Butt deposited a cheque of Rs5 million in 2013-14. Soon afterwards, he said, Butt was appointed as chief of the Gujrat Beautification Committee on the orders of Shehbaz Sharif’s personal staff officer Attaullah Tarar. The peon died in 2015, but his account remained functional till 2017-18, he claimed. 
He, however, said the low-paid employees were not defaulters, but had been mentioned in the FIA challan. They could become approvers in the case subject to the prosecution’s decision, he explained. 
Meanwhile, Information and Broad­casting Minister Fawad Chaudhry said after the availability of the supposed evidence in the money laundering case, PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif cannot escape punishment, reported APP. 
Addressing a press conference in Islamabad along with Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting Farrukh Habib, Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid and Special Adviser to the PM on Political Communication Shahbaz Gill, the information minister said Shahzad Akbar had during a meeting of spokespersons given a detailed briefing on the alleged corruption of Shehbaz and family. 
About a year ago, he said, it had come to light that the former chief minister and his son, Hamza, were involved in money laundering and operated (benami) accounts directly in which 17,000 transactions by 18 individuals were detected. These accounts were used to launder Rs16bn by only one factory owned by Shehbaz and family. 
He alleged that this corruption was just the tip of the iceberg and asked the media to examine the case documents and bring facts before the people. Shehbaz can only escape punishment if no hearings in the case were held. He hoped the court would hear the case daily for its early disposal. 
He further told the media that during the Punjab committee meeting, the premier expressed dissatisfaction over the Khanewal by-election. He said deficiencies should be rectified and the election commission take steps accordingly as there were reports of money laundering and horse trading during the by-elections. 
He also said a high-level committee had been formed in Punjab to finalise the candidates for district mayor for the upcoming local body elections in the province. 
Furthermore, he said Energy Minister Hammad Azhar briefed the spokespersons meeting on the gas issue, saying it was not possible for the government to provide costly imported gas to industries at cheaper rates. 
Reacting to the government’s tirade, the PML-N alleged Shahzad Akbar is planning to leave the country sensing difficult times ahead for the PTI government. 
“Prime Minister Imran Khan has admonished Mr Akbar for causing troubles for him as at the end of the day nothing has been proven against opposition leaders. There are reports that Akbar has decided to move abroad as he knows the Imran Khan government’s days are numbered,” said PML-N deputy secretary general Attaullah Tarar at a presser in Lahore. 
Also, Shehbaz Sharif’s spokesperson Malik Ahmad Khan said it was unprecedented that an adviser was controlling investigations by institutions — a reference to the NAB and FIA. “The Sharif group of industries should take legal action against Shahzad Akbar,” he suggested.
