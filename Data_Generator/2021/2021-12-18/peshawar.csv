0,KP Assembly employees draw millions as honorarium for prolonged sitting,"Speaker doesn’t know why house in session for five months, says his press secretary.","PESHAWAR: For the last five months, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly has been paying its 500-plus staff members a hefty sum of over Rs6 million as monthly honorarium for a long-drawn session with lawmakers from both sides of the aisle, including the speaker, knowing little about the reasons for the prolongation of the sitting.
The session, which was called on July 29 by the provincial government and is still under way, is apparently becoming one of the longest in the parliamentary history of the assembly. Sources said that more than 500 employees of the assembly secretariat were being paid an additional basic salary, as notified by the finance committee of the assembly, as honorarium whenever the house was in session.
The amount totals over Rs6 million a month, an official told Dawn requesting anonymity.
He said that all staff members of the provincial assembly were entitled to get “session allowance”, which was equal to one basic salary paid in addition to the monthly pay, until the session was prorogued.

Speaker doesn’t know why house in session for five months, says his press secretary

“Apart from payment of the session allowance to staff of the secretariat, officials of other departments and its attached directorates also claim transport and daily for attending the sittings, adding to burden on the exchequer,” he said.
Significantly, lawmakers and relevant officials are clueless about the reasons why the government has kept the assembly in session for such a long period. Even Speaker Mushtaq Ahmad Ghani, custodian of the house, does not know reasons and intentions of the government for prolonging the session for five months.
“Mr Speaker does not know about the reasons,” said Raja Usman, press secretary to the speaker.
He said when the government summoned the session, the speaker couldn’t prorogue the sitting and that he could only adjourn it.
Details available on the assembly’s official website show that the house has met for just 22 days during the course of five months long session.
An official source said it had become something of a trend with the assembly to be in session for two days, only to be adjourned for 15 to 20 days.
However, even when the house has been in session, its proceedings have been marred by a lack of interest from both sides of the aisle. Throughout the summer season, Speaker Mushtaq Ghani struggled with the bureaucracy, ministers and members of the treasury benches to improve their attendance.
Annoyed with the low attendance of members earlier last month, Mr Ghani warned he would issue notices to lawmakers absent from the house for more than six days without notice and inform the Election Commission of Pakistan about the matter.
Earlier, Mr Ghani had hinted at the installation of a biometric system to check the attendance of the assembly members.
Opposition leader in the provincial assembly Akram Khan Durrani also expressed reservations about the prolonging of the session and a lack of interest on part of the members as well as bureaucracy.
Another official told Dawn on condition of anonymity that the speaker, instead of hurling empty verbal threats at absent members, could direct the assembly secretariat to prevent them from drawing salaries.
He said the “Salaries and Allowances of Members Act” declared, “If a member fails to attend at least three-fourth of the total number of meetings held on a month, or if elected during the course of a month, fails to attend at least three-fourth of the total number of meetings held in that month subsequent to the date on which he makes an oath, shall be ineligible to draw salary for that month.”
A lack of seriousness in the ongoing session could be gauged from the fact that house was scheduled to meet on Dec 21. However, on Thursday, the assembly secretariat issued a notification changing the date to Dec 27. However, the notification did not offer any specific reason for the change of date.
MPA of the opposition Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal Inayatullah Khan said there was no such provision in the “Procedure and Conduct of Business Rules of the Assembly”, which restricted the government from keeping the house in session for a long time.
“This is against parliamentary ethics and norms to continue a session for months without a specific agenda,” he said, adding that the government had clear majority in the assembly and could convene the session any time if necessary, instead of dragging it for five months.
Parliamentary affairs minister Shaukat Yousafzai did not respond to a Dawn request for comments on the matter.

Accompanied by members of the association, Mr Khan said the meeting expressed concern about assigning of duties for teachers, including women, in far-flung areas away from their native localities despite commitment by the local election commissioner and the education department that the teachers would be assigned election duties in their native areas in order to avoid any inconvenience.

8,Petition for women polling station’s relocation rejected,PTI candidates from Nowshera had filed plea with high court...,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has rejected a petition seeking the transfer of a women polling station from a government school to another for the upcoming village council elections in Nowshera district.
The petition was filed by Niaz Ali Shah and three other Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf candidates for general seats and those reserved for youth and peasants in the Wali village council.
A bench consisting of Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Justice Syed Arshad Ali rejected it after the counsel concluded arguments for and against it.
The petitioners had said they had submitted an application with Nowshera’s district returning officer, who was also the local deputy commissioner,to shift a women polling station from Government Primary School, Wali, to Government Girls High School, Gulabad, (Wali) with census block code 39011412 and the application was accepted.

PTI candidates from Nowshera had filed plea with high court

They added that the polling station was also reproduced in the final list of polling stations for local council polls to be held on Dec 19 under Form 319/ Wali polling station.
The petitioners said as they and other people were busy with their election campaign, the DRO again shifted the polling station without giving any cogent reason.
They said they were aggrieved by that decision and therefore, they formally moved the Election Commission of Pakistan for its redressal, but to no avail.
The petitioners said there was no provision of appeal or revision for the purpose in the Local Government (Conduct of Election) Rules, 2021, to approach any particular forum and therefore, the petitioner had to approach the high court.
Advocate Syed Azizuddin Kakakhel appeared for an independent candidate, Mian Abid Kakakhel, and said the petitioners belonged to the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf.
He argued that historically, the women polling station was set up at the Government Primary School Wali and the petitioners had intentionally been trying to get it shifted to a far-flung area for the polling of bogus votes without difficulty.
The counsel said the polling station was shifted to another school but the returning officer cancelled it after holding an inquiry into a complaint.
He argued that the women polling station at the Government Primary School, Wali, was the most suitable premises and shifting the same to a faraway area was not in favour of the voters.
The lawyer said there was no legal justification for the relocation of the polling station.

9,Businessmen oppose changes to Customs Act,Fear Pak-Afghan trade will be badly affected...,"PESHAWAR: The local businessmen have rejected the recent amendments to the Customs Act for the restoration of the powers of the Karachi customs director-general to determine the valuation of fresh and dry fruits imported from Afghanistan and said the move would badly hit the Pak-Afghan trade.
They demanded the immediate withdrawal of the changes.
The matter was discussed during a meeting chaired by Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Hasnain Khurshid Ahmad at the Chamber House here on Friday, according to a statement.
The participants included SCCI senior vice-president Imran Khan Mohmand, vice- president Javed Akhtar, former senior vice-president Engineer Manzoor Elahi, Pak-Afghan Joint Chambers of Commerce and Industry vice-president Ziaul Haq Sarhadi, importers and exporters.

Fear Pak-Afghan trade will be badly affected

They were informed that a large number of traders were associated with the import and export of  fresh and dry fruits from Afghanistan and their valuation was done by a committee formed by the customs authorities in Peshawar and Quetta.
The valuation carried out by the Karachi customs DG was withdrawn after the inclusion of Section 25-A in the Customs Act in the last fiscal.
The meeting was told that the valuation of dry and fresh fruits imported from the European Union and US was higher due to their high quality, while the fresh and dry fruits imported from Afghanistan were natural and of low grade and therefore, their value was low. The quality of the EU-US and Afghan goods differ greatly and therefore, they have different values.
The participants feared that determination of the same valuation for both fruits imported from EU-US and Afghanistan would prove disastrous for Pak-Afghan mutual and transit trade.
They said the valuation increased by Pakistan for Afghan fruits increased valuation of imports from Pakistan rendering Pakistani products noncompetitivein the Afghan market, which won’t suit them.
The meeting was informed that Section 25-A was inserted to the Customs Act to facilitate trade from Afghanistan, while collectors were empowered to determine the value of imported goods from land border stations after consultation, including relevant chambers of commerce and trade bodies. 
However, the section has been deleted causing severe problems for Afghan exporters and Pakistani importers.

She said that Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf had this time even failed to find suitable candidates in the local government elections. The main reason for the PTI’s unpopularity, she said, was the unprecedented price hike and unemployment in the country. 
Asma Alamgir claimed that her party’s popularity was going up in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and as such it was contesting the LG election without striking alliance with any other party. 
“We will continue our efforts for strengthening the democratic institutions,” she said and urged the people to support PPP candidates.
