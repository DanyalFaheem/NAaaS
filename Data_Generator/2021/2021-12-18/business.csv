0,Engro seeks to expand LNG terminals,Need stressed to remove hurdles in way of operationalisation of terminals’ additional capacity.,"KARACHI: Apparently opposing the setting up of more offshore terminals of Liquefied Natural Gas (RLNG) to enhance growing gas demand in the country through Floating Storage and Regasification Units (FSRU), Engro Corporation is seeking expansion of existing terminals followed by development of onshore terminal to resolve the gas crisis. 
Briefing journalists on Friday, Chief Executive Officer of Engro Elengy Terminal (EETL) Yusuf Siddiqui confirmed that the company was planning an onshore terminal for which space has been allocated at its existing venue, close to its FSRU — commonly known as Terminal-1— that would also help create land-based storage for LNG, direly needed to support gas supplies and address fragilities. 
To curtail the gas crisis, Pakistan must prioritise the expansion of existing terminals under the approved Third-Party Access (TPA) rules on an immediate basis, while eventually transitioning towards onshore terminals for greater energy security, he said. 

Need stressed to remove hurdles in way of operationalisation of terminals’ additional capacity

Highlighting the achievements of EETL, Mr Siddiqui said the company has set new industry benchmarks in over five years of its safe and essentially non-stop operations with an availability factor of around 98pc. EETL now contributes around 15 per cent gas supplies to Pakistan and can be considered the country’s largest “gas field” (630-690 mmscfd). 
Head of Commercial & Business Development Syed Ammar Ali Shah agreed that the proposed onshore terminal may not remain viable or will be at least delayed in case the two merchant FSRUs taken in hand by two parties -- Tabeer and Energas -- are completed. 
Responding to a question, he said his company believed an integrated LNG terminal was necessary to be up and running before 2030 when the country’s gas shortage would surge beyond three billion cubic feet per day. He said unlike the existing EETL, the future facility would be without any government involvement. 
Mr Siddiqui said that as the most utilised regasification terminal in the world, Terminal-1 had enabled Pakistan to save more than $3bn through import substitution of furnace oil. 
Since its inception, the EETL has achieved send-out of more than 1,200bn cubic feet (BCF) of RLNG/natural gas. Further, its partnership with world-class organisations like Royal Vopak of the Netherlands has brought global expertise and foreign investment to Pakistan for the development of the LNG sector. 
He said that LNG imports, which now constitute around 30pc of the total gas supply mix, have been instrumental to bridge energy shortages as the production of indigenous gas continues to decline drastically. 
To mitigate gas shortfall in future, the government has adopted a favourable policy of encouraging private sector involvement in the LNG sector, but there is a need to remove any roadblocks that impede operationalisation of additional capacity of existing LNG terminals under TPA rules, as allowed under the LNG Policy 2011 and LNG Supply Agreement (LSA) with the Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC). 
The TPA will allow private players to have access to the terminal capacity and bring LNG in the country, with no guarantee or liability required by the Government or state-owned entities. This step will facilitate LNG market development as a whole and mitigate circular debt in the gas sector. 
While the expansion of existing terminals offers a short-term and quickest possible solution to bridge the supply-demand gap, Pakistan must eventually shift its focus from FSRU-based terminals to onshore LNG terminal. Based on global experience, Mr Yusuf stated that the deployment of first or second FSRU is followed by an onshore terminal to ensure energy security, longevity of gas market and creation of a strategic national asset for the country. 
With an expected capital outlay of $500-600 million, Engro Corporation and Royal Vopak are evaluating the development of Pakistan’s first multi-functional onshore LNG terminal that will offer regasification, bunkering and LNG trucking services. 
If approved, the project will be built in a phased approach on open access terminal concept. The onshore terminal would result in reduced foreign exchange outflow compared to FSRUs, create greater market competition and help optimise the LNG supply chain. 
Mr Shah said the government had also asked the company to consider expanding its existing terminal by about 150mmcfd, a proposal Engro had been advocating without any success because of hesitance shown by the SSGC to overcome legal challenges.

5,Rare SBP move causes money market rates to decline,"Central bank conducts unusual 63-day open market operation, injects Rs1.77tr into banking system through two OMOs.","KARACHI: In an unusual open market operation (OMO) that included the injection of liquidity for a 63-day period, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) provided the money market with total funds of Rs1.77 trillion on Friday.
The central bank buys and sells government debt papers almost every week to control short-term interest rates in the money market. However, funds injection through liquid assets for a tenor of more than two months is out of the ordinary given that OMOs are typically held for much shorter tenors.
“Yields in the secondary market had become too unrealistic. The SBP has injected liquidity for a longer period to give confidence to the market that the policy rate isn’t going up anytime soon,” said Samiullah Tariq, head of research at Pak-Kuwait Investment Company, while speaking to Dawn.
Yields on treasury bills in the secondary market should typically be 20-25 basis points higher than the benchmark interest rate. However, they significantly exceeded the policy rate of 9.75pc in spite of the SBP’s unambiguous “forward guidance” that no rate hike was expected in the short run.
In the latest OMO, the SBP injected Rs1.09 billion at 9.82pc for seven days and Rs689bn at 9.9pc for 63 days. The regulator’s move bore fruit immediately. Interest rates in the money market came down by 34-40 basis points to 10.27pc and 11.07pc for three-month and six-month papers, respectively, according to a research note by Topline Securities.

Similarly, Pakistan Investment Bonds also witnessed a fall in yields by 10-13 basis points on their three- and five-year papers to 11.53pc and 11.58pc, respectively.
The latest OMO is the manifestation of the SBP’s forward guidance, said Mr Tariq, as banks can keep this liquidity for an extended period of time without having to worry about an interest rate hike.
In its monetary policy statement on Dec 14, the SBP had called the significant rise in secondary market yields unwarranted. But the yields stayed at the same elevated level in the subsequent auction of treasury bills on Dec 15. In fact, yields on the same instruments in the secondary market further rose by 20-30 basis points following the Dec 15 auction.
“Banks tried to extract maximum benefit for themselves. The government had to borrow in the last auction to meet its rollover target. But the next auction will likely be at a lower rate,” he said about the Dec 29 auction of treasury bills.
Meanwhile, SBP Governor Reza Baqir told Bloomberg TV on Friday the central bank will “take a pause” before going for any further hikes in the key interest rate. 
The SBP has increased the policy rate by a total of 275 basis points in three steps since September to control inflation. It resulted in the depreciation of the rupee that, according to Bloomberg, has been the worst performer for the past six months among 13 Asian currencies.
The dollar closed at Rs178.04 in the interbank market on Friday, which shows the rupee lost 1.46pc from the beginning of December when the parity stood at Rs175.47.

6,"Textile, clothing exports jump 28pc to $7.8bn in 5MFY22",Falling rupee one of the reasons behind the boost in demand for Pakistani products.,"ISLAMABAD: Textile and clothing exports grew 28 per cent year-on-year to $7.75 billion in the first five months (July to November) of this fiscal year, mainly on the back of a massive depreciation in the rupee’s value and a steady rise in global demand. 
The year-on-year growth in November was even higher at 35pc, data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics showed on Friday. 
The government has yet to announce the much-awaited textile and apparel policy pending for the last few years. Several drafts have been presented before the Economic Coordination Committee, but the policy has yet to be approved. 

Falling rupee one of the reasons behind the boost in demand for Pakistani products

However, in the budget 2021-22, the government drastically reduced duty and taxes on the imports of several hundred raw materials to bring down the input cost of exportable products. Liquidity issues were also resolved to a considerable extent by a timely release of refunds and the payment of cash subsidies. 
Data showed that ready-made garments exports jumped 23.4pc in value and 23.6pc in quantity during July-November, while the exports of knitwear edged up 36.6pc in value but dipped 14pc in quantity. Bedwear exports grew 23.6pc in value and 23.9pc in quantity. 
Towel exports were up by 18pc in value and 9.4pc in quantity, whereas those of cotton cloth rose by 22.3pc in value and 16.2pc in quantity. 
Among primary commodities, cotton yarn exports surged 65.5pc and those of yarn made from material other than cotton by 118.8pc. The exports of made-up articles — excluding towels — rose by 15pc, while those of tents, canvas and tarpaulin dipped by an equal percentage during the period under review. The export of raw cotton declined by 100pc, which means there were no exports of the commodity during the period. 
The import of textile machinery jumped 97.9pc in July-November, reflecting expansion or modernisation in the textile industry. 
To bridge the shortfall in the domestic sector, the industry imported 313,729 tonnes of raw cotton in July-November compared to 239,111 tonnes a year ago, an increase of 31.2pc. 
Similarly, the import of synthetic fibre dropped 4.7pc as the industry imported 195,504 tonnes this year compared to 205,241 tonnes. The import of synthetic and artificial silk yarn fell 3.2pc to 164,834 tonnes from 170,313 tonnes in the year-ago period. 
The import of worn clothing recorded a growth of 110.4pc to 428,419 tonnes from 203,648 tonnes last year. 
During the five-month period, the country’s overall exports posted a year-on-year growth of around 27pc to reach $12.36bn from $9.74bn in the same period last year.
