0,Ravi project environment-friendly: counsel,Argues land acquisition proceedings on behalf of Ruda were in accordance with the law.,"LAHORE: Senator Barrister Ali Zafar on Friday explained to the Lahore High Court that the Riverfront Urban Development Project (RRUDP) was environment friendly and would ensure conservation, clean air for Lahore and include within it a massive forest.
In his concluding arguments on behalf of the Ravi Urban Authority (Ruda), Mr Zafar argued that the Punjab Assembly had deemed it necessary to create Ruda as an authority over a specified area contiguous to existing Lahore city so that the increasing population could be accommodated in a sister city in a planned manner.
He said the project would ensure compliance with all environmental protocols for battling against climate change. He pointed out that the project included a mechanism for water conservation, groundwater recharge, flood protection and innovative approaches to mitigate pollution.
Defending the acquisition of land for the project, Barrister Zafar argued that according to many judgements of the superior courts, the acquisition for the purpose of housing projects or other such developments had been declared valid.
Therefore, he said, the land acquisition proceedings on behalf of Ruda were in accordance with the law. He alleged the petitions against Ruda had been filed by certain vested interests and private housing schemes who did not want the planned city to come into existence.
He also rejected an argument of the petitioners that the Ravi Urban Development Act 2020 had taken away the powers of the local government. He argued that any local government having any objection to the master plan could challenge the same before the court.
The counsel also defended acquisition of agricultural land for the project and relied upon judgements of the courts in support of his argument. He also pointed out that the land would not be compulsorily acquired but on a voluntary basis people had been offered compensation in the shape of developed plots in addition to monetary compensation.
He said the court may direct Ruda to increase the forested area and make a green buffer zone to protect environment and air of Lahore. He said Ruda was ready to appoint consultants approved by the court and conduct another environment study in order to ensure all environmental aspects were catered for.
Justice Shahid Karim adjourned the hearing till Dec 20 for the arguments of the advocate general of Punjab and other counsel.
In this case, the judge had already stayed the process of land acquisition for the project for not meeting the legal requirements and environmental laws.

1,Shahzad Akbar wants Pakistani team to raise Nawaz extradition at FATF meet,Says Pakistan government has also filed an extradition request for former finance minister Ishaq Dar.,"LAHORE: Adviser to Prime Minister on Accountability and Interior Shahzad Akbar says the Pakistan’s technical committee attending the next FATF meeting should raise concern that a convict (former premier Nawaz Sharif) is residing in the UK and needs to be extradited as per the Pakistan government’s request. 
“Mr Sharif neither has UK citizenship nor a valid passport which has already expired during his stay in London, where he had actually gone to get medical treatment,” Mr Akbar told media at the chief minister’s secretariat on Friday. 
The prime minister’s adviser said Nawaz Sharif had been cornered in the UK as the Pakistan government was actively pursuing his extradition case. He said Mr Sharif was a convict and was not even entitled to get a visit visa as per UK’s immigration laws. 
“When Mr Sharif applied for second extension in his stay, Pakistan filed an objection with the UK home secretary and the extension request was rejected. “Now Nawaz Sharif has challenged the home secretary’s decision in the immigration tribunal,” he said and added that Mr Sharif would immediately be required to leave the UK in case the home secretary’s decision was upheld. 
“Since Mr Sharif’s passport has expired and the renewal application rejected (for he being a proclaimed offender), the former prime minister will be issued one-time travel documents when he would be extradited or he himself planned to return to Pakistan,” he said and quipped that the Kot Lakhpat Jail was awaiting him. 
The PM’s adviser said the Pakistan government had also filed an extradition request for former finance minister Ishaq Dar, former chief minister Shehbaz Sharif’s son Salman Shehbaz and son-in-law Ali Imran.  
He said Ishaq Dar’s extradition case was pending because he had filed an asylum request in the UK, while Salman Shehbaz and Ali Imran’s cases were also being pursued actively.

2,PM Imran will decide on alliance with TLP: minister,Says federal govt is taking steps to bring Nawaz Sharif back from London.,"LAHORE: Punjab Law Minister Muhammad Basharat Raja says any decision on political alliance with the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan will be made by Prime Minister Imran Khan. 
Responding to a question about his personal opinion on alliance with the TLP, he said: “There is no worth of personal opinion of an individual who is affiliated with a party and is a part of the cabinet. But he can say with clarity that any decision on the subject will be made by none other than Prime Minister Imran Khan.” 
Mr Raja was talking to reporters at the Punjab Assembly on Friday and briefing them on the performance of the government regarding lawmaking. 
He said the federal government was taking steps to bring back Nawaz Sharif from London where he had gone for his medical treatment in November last year. He said the former PM was involved in active politics while sitting in London but would pretend to be ailing when asked to return home. 
Commenting on the Khanewal by-polls result, the law minister termed election a political game and that the PML-N won its own seat. He said the N-Leaguers would claim the win of the narrative of ‘Respect for Vote’ in case of victory but raise allegations of rigging in case of loss.  
He said no clause of the Punjab Local Government Ordinance 2021 was in conflict with the Constitution. He said at least 20 bills had been passed in four months of the fourth parliamentary year while 40 more bills were in the pipeline.

7,LHC rejects pleas for LG tenure extension,"Mayor, reps from different cities were petitioners","LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Friday dismissed petitions by the representatives of the local government seeking the provision of a time period excluded from their tenure due to the suspension of the system by the Punjab government.
Lahore’s lord mayor retired Col Mubashir Javed and representatives from different cities were the petitioners.
The counsel for the petitioners argued that the representatives were aggrieved of the illegal dissolution of the local government without following the procedure of the succeeding legislation in 2019 by which they were deprived of representing the electorate for almost 22 months.
They said the petitioners were denied the legitimate expectation to serve the public interest of their constituents, which was not only against the doctrine of democracy but also an infringement of their fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 17 of the Constitution.

Mayor, reps from different cities were petitioners

They asked the court to direct the government to issue a notification in respect of the period the petitioners remained out of their offices. They also urged the court to restrain the government from holding LG elections expiry of the petitioner’s tenure.
An additional advocate general opposed the petitions, saying the matter was not maintainable before the high court. He said the Supreme Court in its decision regarding the restoration of the suspended local government system declared that the Punjab Local Government Act of 2019 was lawfully passed, however, nullified its section 3 only that was about the dissolution of the government.
The law officer argued that the petitioners should have a review petition before the apex court.
A counsel for one of the petitioners had earlier urged the court to declare that the transition should be done from the government to government without the appointment of the administrators.
Announcing a short order, Justice Jawad Hassan dismissed the petitions.

8,Community takes up cudgels against smog by monitoring air quality in Lahore,It was shown as the most polluted city of the world on Wednesday.,"LAHORE: Being on the top of the list of the most polluted cities of the world for Lahore is not uncommon these days in the ranking of the IQAir, a Swiss company that monitors air quality across the globe.  
It was shown as the most polluted city of the world on Wednesday. While on Thursday, Lahore was on the top of the list again with 362 AQI, followed by Bishkek in Kyrgyzstan.  
IQAir collects data of air quality of the city from various independent sources that keep an eye on air pollution levels in various areas of the city. The website gives the real-time air quality index. It shows pollution levels in Lahore and other cities of Punjab and Pakistan. The other city that witnesses air pollution like Lahore’s is Faisalabad that sometimes show air quality even worse than that of the provincial metropolis. 
The monitoring of air quality offended the authorities so much that the Punjab minister for environment protection last month sought action of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) against these monitors under the cyber crime laws, accusing them of misleading and disinforming the public.  
“During the smog season, some unscrupulous elements with mala fide intention are trying to damage the image of Pakistan by reporting misreading/false reading of Air Quality Index (AQI) from different unauthorized sources in Lahore.”  
The Environment Protection Department top officials still claim that it’s fog that the Lahorites in particular and the people of central Punjab in general breathe in.  
One of the initiatives monitoring the air quality of Lahore is the Pakistan Air Quality Initiative (PAQI) that claims to provide community-driven air quality data and resources to increase social awareness. The initiative was launched in 2016 by installing very first monitors. 
“Two monitors were installed in Lahore, as many in Karachi and one each in Islamabad and Peshawar. Now we have approximately 50 monitors across Pakistan and about 30 of them are in Lahore and all of them are working,” Abid Omar, the founder of PAQI, told Dawn. 
PAQI bought the monitors on its own while some of them were bought by individuals and companies, he says. After installation of monitors, he adds, they go through two weeks remote validation process using artificial intelligence and comparing it with the satellite data.  
Regarding the quality of data and the monitors, Mr Omar says that he had presented his findings about two years back in a conference at the Sustainable Development Policy Institute, Islamabad about the data quality.  
“There are more questions about the data quality of the government monitors as even in one city two different monitors give varying readings and it’s often unbelievable what the EPD is putting. Our monitors have been validated by various international organisations. The ones we are using are a part of UN’s environment programme for air quality monitoring. The question is really not of their quality but of the government monitors, which lack in many aspects.” 
Abid Omar says the government has not provided the real-time data as ordered by the Lahore High Court. Real-time data is needed to make timely decisions such as closure or opening of schools and monitoring of results of any action government takes to control smog, he stresses. 
The EPD website gives AQI of the last 24 hours of different areas of Lahore but not real-time reading; however, even its own figures of monitors from four sites of Lahore paint a horrific picture. According to its website, the PM2.5 levels at the National Hockey Stadium, Gulberg on Wednesday was 401 and it was 420 at DHA, Phase 6. However, it did not show the PM2.5 levels at other two stations of Town Hall and Township Block 1 where CO2 (carbon dioxide) or NOx (nitrogen dioxide) levels were shown.  
Environmental lawyer and activist Ahmad Rafay Alam has himself installed a monitor at his house. Talking about the letter of the minister seeking action, he says, “I don’t know what the minister was talking about. The cyber laws are implemented when there is crime. Installing air quality monitors at one’s home by any citizen is not a crime.”  
He further says: “The US consulate has installed a monitor, which is expensive as it costs around USD100,000. People have installed monitors across the city, which check the PM2.5 levels and they are not too expensive”. His own monitor cost him USD250. He says the government monitors (of EPD and Urban Unit) actually show a worse situation compared to private ones.  
He says the data is collected through crowd sourcing, which happens across the world, information is no more a domain of the governments only.  
The PAQI in its report, presented in the Sustainable Development Policy Institute, shows that lockdown implemented in the wake of the Covid-19 in Lahore has had telling effects, which could be a way out for the policymakers. As a result of the lockdown, NO2 levels saw a drop of 49pc from March 1 to April 15, 2020. “The large drop in central and peripheral regions appears linked to traffic emissions and power generation (particularly in NW and South).” 
Regarding the impact of the lockdown on Lahore, it further says “the particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution shows a sharp drop since the start of lockdown on March 23, 2020. PM2.5 pollution reached Punjab’s Environmental Quality Standards of 15 for one day on April 6, 2020.”
During the period of two months, the PM2.5 level reduced by 63pc while NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) reduced by 33pc. According to the report, during the whole year of 2018, Punjab’s environmental quality standards of upper limit of ambient air was there just for 17 days, and in 2019, the air was safe for just 18 days while it was safe for 71 days due to the lockdown when there was almost no traffic on roads and industrial activity was zero.  
For solution to the problem, the PAQI suggests the model of China, which launched a 12-year-plan to improve air quality and reduced PM2.5 levels by 30pc. It revised laws on environmental and atmospheric pollution, implemented stricter emission standards, upgraded fuel standards for transport, promoted cleaner use of coal and made a transition to cleaner energy. It suggests five categories of solutions to resolve Pakistan’s air pollution problem. The categories are industrial emission, agriculture, urban waste, transportation and monitoring and action.  
The steps include post-combustion controls at power stations and large-scale industry; advance emissions standards at industry and brick kilns; crop residue management, regenerative agriculture; urban waste management and dust control; improved quality of diesel and fuels; better public transport, rationalization of cargo transport; nationwide air quality monitoring, education on air pollution, establishment of emission control zones around big cities and capacity building of EPD/EPA. 
Besides the monitors of PAQI and US Department of State (Consulate), IQAir on its website identifies 12 monitors working in Lahore under various categories like government, educational (Beaconhouse) and corporate (private companies) categories. There are 14 anonymous monitoring stations mentioned on the website which have been installed by individuals.  
Instead of living in a state of denial and proving the monitors wrong, the government should take them on board and make solid policies to curtail pollution levels and smog.

9,Minister seeks PA attention towards population control,LAHORE: Provincial Minister for Population Welfare Hashim Dogar has urged the Punjab Assembly to immediately frame a...,"LAHORE: Provincial Minister for Population Welfare Hashim Dogar has urged the Punjab Assembly to immediately frame a policy to control ever-increasing population.
During the Question Hour related to his department on Friday, Mr Dogar told the house that increasing population was the major issue of the country.
Regretting that no government took care of the issue since the Ayub Khan era, he said Pakistan was the 12th largest populous country at present and by 2047 its population was projected to touch 500 million and that of Punjab to 250 million.
It would be hard to provide food, housing and employment to such a large population, he said, urging both the treasury and opposition members to give their suggestions for devising a concrete policy on the issue.
He also proposed a serious threadbare discussion on the issue in the house.
The minister said that his department had engaged 1,400 religious leaders to build awareness among public that family planning was not prohibited in Islam.
PTI MPA Ayesha Iqbal termed the rapid increase in the population a time bomb for the country and urged for joint efforts to tackle the issue.
PML-N’s Zakiya Shahnawaz asked the minister as well as the government to pay attention to the issue, saying there’s no dearth of funds for family planning as many NGOs were ready to finance the campaign.
Law Minister Raja Basharat laid an audit report of the Lahore Waste Management Company for the year 2018-19, whereas PML-N’s Iftikhar Hussain Chachhar tabled an adjournment motion against shortage of diammonium phosphate (DAP) fertilizer. It was accepted and referred to a committee by the Panel of Chairman Mian Shafi.

10,Freight container price raise contributes to inflation,LAHORE: An abnormal increase in the freight container prices globally has not only caused surge in cost of ...,"LAHORE: An abnormal increase in the freight container prices globally has not only caused surge in cost of production but also increased prices of several items for the end consumers. The situation has also impacted the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector adversely as the people associated with various small businesses have no option but to bear three-time rise in the freight charges.  
“It is a global phenomenon that emerged in the post-Covid situation and it caused a massive surge in the rates of shipping containers. The situation still persists,” said Moin Malik, the chief executive officer of the Agility Logistics.  
“It started happening during the pandemic when the freight sector attracted a negative growth, forcing 30 companies to go for merger. During the post-Covid situation, it led to disturbing the entire supply-chain sector, especially in the United States,” he explained.  
Mr Malik was of the view that the shipping companies, which used to make investments in vessels, didn’t do in the last and current years.  
To a question, he said the rise in the shipping cost (both imports and exports) and production was surely being passed on to the end-consumers, affecting the common man financially.  
“I am not seeing any decline in the freight charges in the near future since it is a global issue,” he added.  
According to Pakistan Textile Exporters Association (PTEA), the monopoly of few business groups after merger of various companies involved in the shipping and freight business worldwide had adversely affected several businesses.  
“The SME sector became the main victim of the global surge in the freight charges as it did not have the capacity to bear the skyrocketed containers’ charges, which were three times more than the last year. Large-scale manufacturing units too are facing impact of this situation but not to the extent the SMEs’,” explained PTEA Secretary Azizullah Goheer.  
He said that before pandemic there were nine shipping lines that had now reduced to only five. “To ease the international market, I would suggest that the Pakistan National Shipping Corporation (PNSC) should immediately intervene and take effective measures,” he opined.  
Talking to Dawn, Malik Shafqat, engaged in the containers sale/purchase & rent business in Lahore, termed deterioration due to severe shortage of containers in most countries of the world, except China.  
“During Covid-related lockdowns and restrictions, China purchased the maximum number of containers in the world, especially those countries bordering it by land and maritime. So when the businesses resumed gradually, China was didn’t face any issue related to supply chain internally or externally. Rest of all faced issues due to severe shortage of the containers that led to increasing freight charges three to four times,” Shafqat explained. 
He said the sale price of a 20 and 40 feet container ranged from PKR300,000 to PKR400,000 and PKR600,000 to PKR800,000, respectively. “It is too much now as it, about one and half year ago, was just PKR100,000 to PKR150,000 and PKR300,000 to PKR400,000, respectively.” 
When contacted, Minister for Maritime Affairs Syed Ali Haider Zaidi said the government had found a right path to get rid of the situation permanently.  
“We have established Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier (NVOCC), a subsidiary of the Pakistan National Shipping Corporation, Ministry of Maritime Affairs. The core objective of the NVOCC is to work closely with the private sector to get the containers manufactured to meet our country’s own demand,” he said.  
“The company will also be responsible to have advance booking of adequate space at vessels for our exports and imports in collaboration with the private sector,” he maintained. He added that he was also in discussions with the foreign investors seeking investments in the businesses related to shipping lines, containers manufacturing, supply chain etc to deal with the situation.

The villagers, belonging to Chak 441 to Chak 443 of Faqirwali, alleged the irrigation officials up to the office of the sub-divisional officer (SDO) were involved in selling the farmers’ share of water from the 6/R Canal to influential landowners by taking bribe. As a result, thousands of acres of land of the tail-end farmers were deprived of the canal water or they were getting insufficient water to irrigate their lands, they added. 
The protesters, including All Pakistan Kisan Ittehad Haroonabad chapter general secretary Tariq Javed, told the media the excesses of the corrupt irrigation officials, including a sub-engineer, had left no other option for the hundreds of families of farmers without a drop of canal water. 
The farmers kept the road block for hours. They warned of blocking all roads leading to Bahawalnagar if the irrigation officials did not mend their ways and restored normal water supply to the tail-end areas.  
The Irrigation Department Exen and SDO were not available for their comments. 
BAIL: An anti-corruption court of Bahawalpur dismissed the post-arrest bail plea of a tehsildar of Bahawalnagar, a week after his pre-arrest bail was rejected by the Multan ACE in another corruption case. 
Tehsildar Zafar Mughal was arrested red-handed by the ACE on Dec 6 with a bribe amount of Rs100,000 at his office. He was charged with receiving the bribe from a citizen, Ali Khan of Bahawalnagar, in exchange of giving him favours in an inquiry against a patwari launched on complaint of Ali. The Board of Revenue, Punjab (Field Establishment Branch) had suspended tehsildar from service on Dec 8, two days after his arrest. 
On Friday, Mughal was sent to the district jail after his post-arrest bail plea was rejected by the special judge of ACE Bahawalpur Chaudhry Muhammad Tariq Javed. 
The revenue sources told Dawn that nine corruption cases had been registered against Mughal during his tenure in Multan, Khanewal, Vehari, Muzaffargarh and Bahawalnagar from 2015 to 2021. 
A corruption case was registered against him during his posting as tehsildar in Multan on June 26, in which he was already on interim bail. Despite that case, he had got the post of Bahawalnagar tehsildar in the mid of July because of backing of some ruling party legislators, the sources alleged.

16,Minister criticises Aptma for ‘distorting’ facts on gas cuts,LAHORE: Federal Minister for Energy Hammad Azhar has criticised the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (Aptma)...,"LAHORE: Federal Minister for Energy Hammad Azhar has criticised the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (Aptma) for distorting facts on the gas curtailments to Captive Power Plants (CPPs) and said the government cannot bow to the wish or ego of anyone.
“A majority of industry (94 per cent), including cement factories, glass factories, etc., are being operated on electricity (power connections). But why not the textile exports industry that claims to produce efficiently on captive power. They (the textile industry) are the only sector being given subsidised gas and power tariff. But despite all this, they are complaining,” the minister said in a TV talk show on Friday.
“The industry (through Aptma) had in February, this year, pledged to not receive subsidy after June 30, this year and switch on operation of mills through electricity. But they didn’t fulfill their promise and took the matter to court,” he explained while responding to queries related to gas cut to the CPP-run industry.
The minister said the government couldn’t provide Re-gasified Liquefied Natural Gas to the textile export industry on cheaper rates after purchasing it on higher rates.
Aptma, besides raising the issue in media, also wrote a letter recently to Prime Minister Imran Khan and stated that most of its member mills are co-generation and use gas to produce electricity as well as steam and hot water used in the process.
Even if the additional electricity load could be accommodated, the mills cannot generate steam and hot water from electricity. “As most of the mills (80pc) will not be in a position to operate, the impact on employment would be extremely detrimental. As a consequence, a large number of workers would be laid off in Punjab leading to many social and political consequences,” Aptma warns.
The minister said all mills have electricity connections and if some of them are yet to be provided electricity on increased load through applications they submitted already, it doesn’t mean that they are unable to run their mills on the existing electricity connections.
