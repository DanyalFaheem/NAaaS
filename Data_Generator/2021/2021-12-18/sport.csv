0,"Steve Smith, bowlers put England in trouble at Adelaide Oval",Australia declared their first innings on a commanding 473 for nine.,"ADELAIDE: England were battling to stay in the second Ashes Test on Friday after Australia removed both openers in a fiery spell under lights on day two to leave the visitors reeling.
The home team declared their first innings on a commanding 473 for nine at the Adelaide Oval, leaving England to face a trying 40 minutes against a swinging pink ball.
They didn’t fare well with under-pressure Rory Burns lasting just three balls against a rampant Mitchell Starc, edging a rising delivery to Steve Smith at second slip after making just four.
Haseeb Hameed hung on slightly longer before Michael Neser, in for skipper Pat Cummins — who pulled out of the Test at the last minute over a Covid scare — bagged his maiden Test scalp.
Hameed, on six, chipped to Starc at mid-on with Neser mobbed by his team-mates.
Once again, England’s fate rests with skipper Joe Root, who was unbeaten on five alongside Dawid Malan on one as they reached stumps at 17 for two after lightning forced an early halt.
England crashed by nine wickets in the first Test at Brisbane and if they go 2-0 down in Adelaide the Ashes are as good as gone, with Root’s men needing to win all three remaining Tests.
“It’s been a tough two days obviously, we’ve spent a lot of time out in the field,” said England all-rounder Ben Stokes.
“But we get to turn up tomorrow in the natural light [which] I think most people agree is the easiest and best time to be a batter out in the middle.”
He added:  “We don’t believe we’re beaten already.”
Earlier, Marnus Labuschagne top-scored with a magnificent 103 while David Warner (95) and Smith (93) provided vital support after Australia resumed from their overnight 221-2.
Stokes was the pick of the England attack with 3-113, while Jimmy Anderson took 2-58.
Number three Labuschagne completed his epic century after setting himself up by batting almost all day on Thursday, bringing up his sixth Test ton and first in an Ashes series off a dogged 287 balls.
But he struggled when Ollie Robinson was brought into the England attack and he was trapped lbw, adding just eight runs to his overnight 95.
“It was nice to get that hundred, obviously got a few chances there but that’s how it goes sometimes, you ride your luck,” Labuschagne said. “It feels like you have to grind for every run that you’re out there.”
Labuschagne in the process also became the first player to hit three centuries in  day-night Test matches. Of the  3,068 players in Test cricket’s 144-year history, only Don Bradman,  George Headley, Herbert Sutcliffe and Mike Hussey have reached 2,000  runs faster than Labuschagne’s total in 34 innings.
Bradman achieved his 2,000 runs in 22 innings, Jamaican Headley in 32 and England’s Sutcliffe and Australia’s Hussey in 33.
Labuschagne  has now scored centuries in three consecutive day-night Tests at the  Adelaide Oval, averaging almost 100 and with just one score below 40.
Smith struck a fine 93 to help Australia reassert control after Travis Head and Cameron Green were out in quick succession after Labuschagne departed.
The stand-in captain was England’s key tormentor at the last Ashes in 2019, on his return from a ball-tampering ban, and he kept his cool in sweltering Adelaide.
He was ably supported by Alex Carey, who is in the team as replacement wicket-keeper for former skipper Tim Paine, who quit on the eve of the Ashes over a text-message scandal.
Smith came to the crease when Warner was out and barely put a foot wrong, dishing out particular punishment to Chris Woakes, crunching three boundaries in one over then smacking him for a big six.
He looked destined for a 28th Test century but was dismissed lbw to an Anderson ball that pitched up — the English veteran’s first wicket of the tour.
Carey fell soon after for 51, his maiden Test half-century, chipping to Hameed at cover off Anderson.
Temperatures in Adelaide peaked at 37 degrees Celsius (99 Fahrenheit) as England toiled, desperately needing wickets to stay in the game.
They were rewarded for their persistence by getting not only Labuschagne but Head, who was high on confidence after an impressive 152 in the first Test at Brisbane.
But he was undone by Root’s part-time spin, with the England captain finding turn and bounce, beating Head with a delivery that left him sprawled on one knee in disbelief, out for 18.
Green only lasted five balls, undone by a fuller delivery from Stokes that clattered into his stumps.
Tailenders Starc and Neser rubbed salt into English wounds in a quickfire 58-run stand before the declaration.

The world’s number one Test bowler was ruled out of the second Ashes Test against England just hours before it started on Thursday for being in close contact with a positive Covid-19 case.
Under South Australia state’s strict bio-security rules he was required to isolate for seven days but has now been permitted to head home, where he must remain until the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne.
“Under the plan approved by SA Health, he will self-drive from isolation and then, with the appropriate PPE [personal protective equipment] and hygiene controls, take a single charter flight,” Cricket Australia said.
“He will continue to observe all isolation requirements in New South Wales.”
Cummins was at an Adelaide restaurant on Wednesday evening when a person at the neighbouring table was identified as positive for coronavirus.
He isolated when he became aware of the situation and has since returned a negative Covid test.
Australian players are permitted to dine out in small groups under Covid rules in place for the Ashes in Adelaide, but should steer clear of densely populated places.

David Becker, former International Cricket Council (ICC) head of legal and Smith’s personal lawyer, issued a statement on Friday in which he disputed findings by Advocate Dumisa Ntsebeza, who headed a Social Justice and Nation Building Commission (SJN) to investigate allegations of racial discrimination in South African cricket.
In a report issued on Wednesday, Ntsebeza found that Smith  “failed to rebut the presumption of unfair discrimination” in appointing former Test wicket-keeper and long-time team-mate Boucher as head coach of the national team ahead of Enoch Nkwe, a black coach who served briefly as national team director.
“Some of the findings are entirely questionable and without any basis,” said Becker, who claimed that lawyers for  “various respondents” had raised  “material concerns” about the integrity of the SJN process.
“Important parts of the evidence are simply not dealt with in the report,” said Becker.
“For example, the ombudsman states that Smith did not explain why he appointed Boucher in his evidence. However, the reasons are clearly addressed by Smith and [former CSA president] Mr [Chris] Nenzani in their affidavits submitted to the SJN.”
Ntsebeza also found that Smith’s appointment was irregular and that a refusal to report to then chief executive Thabang Moroe, who was later dismissed for misconduct, was evidence of  “racial bias against black leadership”.
Becker pointed out that Smith did not appoint himself and that his appointment was approved by the national selectors, the entire board of CSA and senior executives of the organisation.
He had worked happily with Moroe’s acting successor, who was black, and three black presidents.
Becker did not directly address an accusation of racial bias in the decision when Smith was captain to use star batsman A.B. de Villiers as wicket-keeper in a Test series in England in 2012, ahead of black reserve wicket-keeper Thami Tsolekile.
But Becker said CSA would have to consider  “a number of fundamental flaws” in the process of the hearings.
“For instance, how do you make far-reaching and public findings of racial prejudice against certain people and in the same breath say that they are ‘tentative’, as the ombudsman has done?
“How is CSA expected to implement those findings when the ombudsman has said, by his own admission, that he ‘cannot make definitive findings in an instance where the evidence of both the so-called victims and the alleged perpetrators was not tested’?
“Why wasn’t the evidence properly tested? The ombudsman had the opportunity to cross examine the witnesses under the terms of reference and didn’t take that opportunity,” said Becker.

The PCB in this regard has issued an advertisement inviting applications for the posts of batting, bowling, fielding besides High Performance Coach, and Power-hitting Coach.
Though Pakistan great Mohammad Yousuf and Abdul Majeed are already working at the NHPC as batting and fielding coaches, the PCB has decided to hire more coaches.
There were speculations that the PCB may replace Yousuf as batting coach. However according to a PCB official, no one currently on the PCB payroll will leave to adjust  any new individual as PCB’s move is aimed at further strengthening coaching resources for players, especially the juniors.
Interestingly, the PCB advertisement does not include the position of wicket-keeping coach, which fell vacant after Atiq-uz-Zaman resigned early this month. Atiq was working as wicket-keeper-cum-fielding coach.
“As part of its key strategic objective of achieving cricketing excellence by strengthening the foundation of Pakistan cricket through investment into pathways cricket, the Pakistan Cricket Board today launched its search for highly qualified and skilled coaches, who will be based at Lahore’s state of the art National High Performance Centre,” a PCB press release stated on Friday.
“In this relation, the cricket board on Friday posted advertisements for the High Performance Coach as well as batting, bowling, fielding and power-hitting coaches, who, among other qualifications, must boast a minimum experience of five years.
“The High Performance Coach will be required to provide integrated and holistic coaching support to the players across all formats and levels, including life and mental preparedness. He will also be responsible for identifying talent and defining objectives for individual players that would facilitate excellence and augmentation in the players’ game, personalities and leadership, following in the PCB’s vision, Philosophy and approach,” the release added.
“The batting, bowling, fielding and power-hitting coaches, among other qualifications, will lead PCB’s development programmes. They will also be responsible for identifying objectives for individual players within their areas of responsibilities that would facilitate excellence and augmentation in skills enhancements.
“While advertisements for the national team coaches will be posted in due course, the last date for submission of applications for five the National High Performance Centre coaches is Jan 17, 2022. The shortlisted candidates will be interviewed by a panel of experts before the candidates are finalised,” it concluded.
The PCB has to appoint coaching staff for the national team, which is working under head coach Saqlain Mushtaq on interim basis, since Misbah-ul-Haq (head coach) and Waqar Younus (bowling coach) stepped down in September this year in the backdrop of Ramiz Raja coming as new PCB chairman in place of Ehsan Mani.
According to sources, the PCB may not give heavy-duty team management to the national team as it is focussing more to give best coaching facilities to the juniors.

Tennis Australia said the panel would consist of doctors from the fields of immunology, infectious disease and general practice and that the move had been agreed in conjunction with the Victoria Department of Health.
Tiley had previously said all players must be inoculated against Covid-19, with the move throwing the involvement of defending champion Novak Djokovic into doubt as the world number one has yet to disclose his vaccination status.
“We’ve worked closely with the Victorian government to establish fair and independent protocols for assessing medical exemption applications that will enable us to ensure Australian Open 2022 is safe and enjoyable for everybody,” Tiley said.
“Central to this process is that the decisions will be made by independent medical experts and that every applicant gets due consideration.”
The Melbourne Park tournament, the first Grand Slam of the year, is due to begin on Jan 17.
Applicants that pass an initial stage will be subject to a second review conducted by a government-appointed panel of medical experts before the application is submitted to the Australian Immunisation Register.
All submissions will be confidential, Tennis Australia said. Martin Pakula, Victoria state’s sports minister, said the process could set a precedent for other big events.
“We are happy there is some rigour around the process, we think it leads to the best possible outcomes,” he added.
“They want the safest possible event for players and fans. That involves having the most rigorous medical exemption process.”

9,Liverpool shrug off Covid outbreak to beat Newcastle,LONDON: Liverpool shrugged off a coronavirus outbreak to keep their Premier League title challenge on track with a...,"LONDON: Liverpool shrugged off a coronavirus outbreak to keep their Premier League title challenge on track with a 3-1 win over Newcastle that was lit up by Trent Alexander-Arnold’s wonder goal.
The Reds lost Virgil van Dijk and Fabinho to positive cases of Covid before kick-off as a surge of infections across Britain threatens to bring the season to a temporary halt.
Liverpool were further rocked when Jonjo Shelvey opened the scoring against his old club after just seven minutes.
But Newcastle remained mired in the bottom three for a reason as goals from Diogo Jota and Mohamed Salah turned the game around before half-time.
Alexander-Arnold’s thunderbolt four minutes from time rounded off an eighth consecutive win for Jurgen Klopp’s men as they close to within one point of leaders Manchester City.
Klopp spoke out to encourage people to ignore the  “lies and misinformation” around vaccination from coronavirus before kick-off and get their jabs or boosters.
Curtis Jones was also absent for the Reds due to a positive test for Covid.
But Klopp confirmed on Thursday that his squad are fully vaccinated and therefore did not lose any other players due to being close contacts of those with the virus.
Anfield hosted the final top level game in England in front of a full crowd before the pandemic shut football down for three months in March 2020.
History could be repeating itself as five of the 10 Premier League games scheduled for this weekend have already been called off.
Liverpool’s trip to Tottenham is one of those still going ahead for now, but much will depend on how well the outbreak is contained over the coming days.
On the field, Klopp’s men had to respond to City’s 7-0 hammering of Leeds on Tuesday.
And they got off to the worse possible start when Thiago Alcantara’s wayward pass fell perfectly for Shelvey to curl home a wonderful strike from outside the box.
However, a clash between the league’s best attack and worst defence quickly showed.
Newcastle felt aggrieved about the source of Liverpool’s equaliser as referee Mike Dean did not stop the play after a clash of heads between Isaac Hayden and Fabian Schar.
Jota took full advantage as he was completely unmarked at the back post and after Martin Dubravka’s stunning save to deny his first effort, the Portuguese slammed home the rebound.
That goal saw Liverpool break a club record by scoring in a 32nd consecutive game stretching back to April.
Newcastle had a huge chance to retake the lead when Allan Saint-Maximin could not beat Alisson Becker when one-on-one with the Brazilian.
Shelvey then undid much of his good work by gifting Liverpool the chance to go in front.
His backpass played in Sadio Mane and again Dubravka got no help from his defence after saving from the Senegalese as Salah followed up to score his 22nd goal in 23 appearances this season.
Dubravka kept Newcastle in the game during the second period with saves from Mane and Jota.
But there was no stopping Alexander-Arnold’s stunning drive to ensure the Magpies remain in 19th, three points adrift of safety.
CHELSEA STRUGGLES
Everton were missing as  many as 12 players because of injury and illness, forcing manager Rafa  Benitez to start a makeshift lineup containing three youngsters. Two of  them combined for the 77th-minute equaliser. 
Jarrad Branthwaite, a 19-year-old defender who has had loan spells  at Carlisle and Blackburn in recent seasons, poked in at the far post  from a free kick from 20-year-old winger Anthony Gordon. 
That canceled out a goal scored seven minutes earlier by Mason Mount, who has now netted in four straight league games. 
Chelsea have won just  two of its last five league games, having coincided with the absence of  star midfielder NGolo Kante because of injury, and he was only fit  enough to take his place on the bench as an unused substitute. 
Thomas Tuchel admitted Chelsea’s coronavirus outbreak has taken a  toll on his Premier League title chasers.
“We  didn’t have anyone on the bench. We put the last guys in that were  available and we are missing big personalities and quality.” 
Kante is likely to make his return when Chelsea visits Wolverhampton on Sunday. Provided, of course, the league hasn’t been shut down by then. 
The Premier League has postponed five games  that were scheduled for the weekend due to Covid outbreaks at  various clubs. Nine games have been postponed since last week. 
Having led  the table for several weeks, Tuchel’s third placed team are now four  points behind leaders Manchester City.

15,England drawn against Italy and Germany in Nations League,"NYON: England, Italy and Germany were placed in the same group in the draw for the next edition of the UEFA Nations...","NYON: England, Italy and Germany were placed in the same group in the draw for the next edition of the UEFA Nations League on Thursday, a competition in which France will defend their title.
Hungary will complete Group A3, the pick of the groups for the competition which will be played between June next year and June 2023.
The draw means England will renew acquaintances with two sides who they faced at this year’s European Championship -- Gareth Southgate’s team defeated Germany 2-0 at Wembley in the last 16 before losing to Italy on penalties in the final.
England also played Hungary twice in qualifying for the 2022 World Cup earlier this year, winning 4-0 in Budapest and drawing 1-1 at home.
“It’s a good group, it will certainly be fun,” remarked Italy coach Roberto Mancini in comments to the Italian Football Federation website.
Germany and Italy have met at nine major tournaments, most recently at Euro 2016 when the Germans won on penalties in the quarter-finals.
Italy, who must come through play-offs next March to avoid missing a second straight World Cup, are also due to go to London on June 1 to face Copa America winners Argentina in a new intercontinental final.
The fixtures are not yet known but Hungary are due to play their next two home UEFA competition games behind closed doors as a punishment following  “discriminatory behaviour” by supporters at Euro 2020, when incidents of homophobic chanting and racial abuse were alleged to have occurred during several of their group games.
France won the last edition of the Nations League, beating Spain 2-1 in the final in Milan in October.
The reigning world champions were drawn to face Denmark, Croatia and Austria in Group A1.
Portugal, victorious as hosts in the inaugural Nations League finals in 2019, will come up against Spain, Switzerland and the Czech Republic in Group A2.
Belgium, who are the top-ranked team in the world, will play neighbours the Netherlands, Poland and Wales in Group A4.
The Nations League, introduced to replace meaningless friendly matches with more competitive games, splits all of Europe’s 55 member nations into four leagues.
The tournament will be played either side of next year’s World Cup, with group matches from June to September and then the four-team finals -- featuring the winners of the four groups in League A -- in June 2023.
This edition may also offer a path to qualification for Euro 2024, which will be held in Germany, although that has not yet been confirmed by European football’s governing body.
The first Nations League included play-offs that allowed one nation from each league to qualify for Euro 2020, resulting in minnows North Macedonia coming out of League D to play at the finals.
The most recent edition saw the best two group winners from across all leagues who did not finish in the top two of their World Cup qualifying groups earn places in the play-offs for a berth in Qatar.
Austria and the Czech Republic were the two teams who went through in that way and will compete with 10 other teams for three places at the World Cup in play-offs next March.
Scotland and the Republic of Ireland were drawn together in League B, Group 1 alongside Ukraine and Armenia.
The Scots are already due to play Ukraine in Glasgow in the World Cup qualifying play-off semi-finals.
