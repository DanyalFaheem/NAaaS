Reigning champions Inter moved a point ahead of local rivals AC Milan with a statement performance at the San Siro against the Sardinians who had goalkeeper Alessio Cragno to thank the hosts didn’t run up double figures.
Lautaro Martinez’s brace and two more superb goals from Hakan Calhanoglu and Alexis Sanchez extended Inter’s domestic unbeaten run to nine matches and allowed Simone Inzaghi’s team to take charge in Italy following Milan’s draw at Udinese on Saturday.
Inter, who racked up 15 shots on target, hit the bar and missed a penalty, are also four points ahead of former leaders Napoli who slipped back to fourth following a shock 1-0 home defeat at the hands of surprise team Empoli. Atalanta moved above Napoli into third, three points behind Inter, with a 2-1 win at Hellas Verona.
We saw a lot of good teams struggle after their European matches so we knew we needed to be focused. The boys were brilliant right from the start,” said Inzaghi to DAZN. We’re top of the league and in the Champions League last 16 after 11 years, it’s hard to do much better.”
Cagliari are second-from-bottom and their supine performance, even with a number of absences, so angered manager Walter Mazzarri that he left his post-match interview with DAZN after answering just one question.
Inter broke the deadlock at San Siro in the 29th minute whenMartinez headed in Calhanoglu’s corner.
Martinez had a chance to double Inter’s lead moments before halftime after Cragno brought down Sanchez but the Cagliari goalkeeper atoned for his error by saving the penalty and Calhanoglu sent the rebound over the bar.
Inter did get their second goal five minutes after the break as a throw-in from the right was controlled by Nicolo Barella and then crossed in for Sanchez to volley into the bottom left corner.
Calhanoglu added a third in the 66th when he cut inside from the left and curled the ball into the bottom corner, and Martinez put Inter out of sight two minutes later. The Argentina forward controlled Barella’s ball over the top on his chest and then lifted it past Cragno with a delicate volley.
Napoli were on the receiving end of a bizarre goal.
Empoli scored the only goal of the match in the 70th minute. A corner was floated in from the left, Napoli midfielder Andre Anguissa headed it onto the back of Patrick Cutrone’s head at the near post and the ricochet took the ball into the back of the net.
It was an unfortunate way to lose for Napoli who had 30 shots, struck the bar through Eljif Elmas in the first half and had a Juan Jesus goal ruled out for offside nine minutes before Cutrone’s winner.
Atalanta came back from Giovanni Simeone’s 12th goal of the season with strikes in either half from Aleksei Miranchuk and Teun Koopmeiners at Verona.
A sixth straight league win on the road also has Gian Piero Gasperini’s side seven points above fifth-placed Fiorentina in the race for the Champions League.
Two Sassuolo goals in six second-half minutes from Domenico Berardi and Giacomo Raspadori saw the home side fight back to beat Lazio 2-1. Mattia Zaccagni had got Lazio off to a great start by scoring in the sixth minute.
Torino beat Bologna 2-1 to inch further away from the relegation zone.

MADRID: Karim Benzema and Marco Asensio inflicted the latest blow on Atletico Madrid’s title defence after leading Real Madrid to a 2-0 win Sunday to keep their team comfortably at the top of La Liga.
Vinicius Junior again proved to be the difference for Real, setting up Benzema and Asensio in each half of the capital derby.
Diego Simeone’s Atletico entered the Santiago Bernabeu needing a win to rekindle their hopes of getting back in the title race, seven months after they beat out Real and Barcelona in a thrilling finish to the 2020-21 season.
But the commanding win by Carlo Ancelotti’s side opened a 13-point gap for Real over fourth-placed Atletico, who have a game in hand over their rivals. There is still more than half the season left, but the chances of Simeone’s team repeating as champions are fading fast.
“Real are in a ruthless mode right now. They reach your area, and they score,” Simeone said. “They deserved to win the game. I like how they play. They have strong defence, get out quickly on attack and are effective up front. They are having a great season.”
The leading threats to Real are now the pair of rivals from Seville. Sevilla are second at eight points back and having played a game fewer, followed by Real Betis nine points adrift.
“We are on a good run, the only problem we have is that the league is far from over. We have 21 more games to go,” Ancelotti said. “But I am happy with how we are playing. I don’t rule any [rival] out. Atletico have talent, commitment and character.”
Barca, the team that traditionally shares the majority of La Liga titles with Real, suffered another setback in their post-Messi era. A 2-2 draw at Osasuna left them in eighth place, 18 points behind Real. Barca have long known that a fourth-place finish to secure a berth in the Champions League is their realistic goal this season.
Benzema put Real on their way to a 10th straight victory overall in the 16th minute after Luka Modric intercepted a pass by Koke to start a counterattack. Vinicius set up Benzema by stretching Atletico’s defence with a run down the right before finding his unmarked striker with a cross. Benzema did the rest with a superb sweep of his right leg to drive the ball under Jan Oblak for his league-leading 13th goal.
Vinicius, the league’s breakout player, forced Oblak to make a one-handed save to parry a chip shot shortly after Antoine Griezmann generated Atletico’s only shot on target of the first half. Griezmann’s curving free kick in the 35th was saved by Thibaut Courtois.
Benzema, who was doubtful after missing Real’s last match due to a leg injury, was substituted by Luka Jovic at halftime.
Atletico improved after Simeone sent on Joao Flix and Thomas Lemar for Griezmann and Yannick Carrasco for the second half. But another counterattack driven by Vinicius settled the contest when the Brazilian found Asensio all alone to rifle the ball just inside the post in the 57th.
Barca’s nightmare week, meanwhile, ended in more disappointment as they conceded in the 86th minute to draw away at struggling Osasuna.
After losing at home to Betis last weekend and being dumped into the Europa League by Bayern Munich on Wednesday, Barca could only muster a point against Osasuna, who sit 10th and are now winless in eight league matches.
The deflation for Xavi Hernandez’s team will be heightened by the manner of Osasuna’s equaliser, coming so late in the game after two 19-year-olds, Nico Gonzalez and Abde Ezzalzouli, had set them on course for victory.
Instead, Chimy Avila drove into the corner to secure a draw for Osasuna that was as dramatic as it was deserved. David Garcia had earlier levelled for them two minutes after Nico’s opener.
Betis maintained their impressive run after a 4-0 rout of Real Sociedad, who remained fifth after a third consecutive loss.
Left back Alex Moreno scored twice and assisted Juanmi Jiminez for the striker to net his 10th league goal of the season and his sixth in the last four games. Nabil Fekir chipped in with another goal.
Villarreal beat Rayo Vallecano 2-0 at home.

2,Palace pile pressure on Benitez,"LONDON: Demarai Gray won a game for Everton on Monday. He was partially to blame for a defeat on Sunday.

Gray’s...","LONDON: Demarai Gray won a game for Everton on Monday. He was partially to blame for a defeat on Sunday.
Gray’s sloppy pass back into his own penalty area led to Conor Gallagher scoring the first of his two goals for Crystal Palace in their 3-1 Premier League victory over Everton. James Tomkins added the other for Palace while Salomon Rondon netted for the visitors.
Everton’s performance was lacklustre at Selhurst Park, so the 2-1 comeback win over Arsenal six days ago sealed by Gray’s stoppage-time wonder goal proved to be something of a false dawn.
Palace moved above Everton into 12th place, piling the pressure on Everton manager Rafael Benitez as his side lost for the seventh time in their last nine league games.
On-loan Chelsea midfielder Gallagher put Palace ahead in the 41st minute with his fifth goal this season. Gray gave away possession on the edge of his area and Jordan Ayew was first to the loose ball, squaring for Gallagher to fire home.
Benitez, already disliked by Everton fans after his spell in charge of Merseyside rivals Liverpool, saw his plunging popularity dip even further in the second half when he was booed for sending on Rondon to replace Richarlison.
The mood grew even more toxic among Everton’s travelling fans after Tomkins doubled Palace’s lead in the 61st minute. Tomkins poked in from close range after Everton made a hash of clearing Will Hughes’ corner.
Rondon got one back with his first Everton goal in the 70th minute, the striker slotting home after Joel Ward deflected Abdoulaye Doucoure’s shot into his path.
But Gallagher’s 20-yard curler in stoppage-time left Everton languishing seven points above the relegation zone.
“You cannot explain that all the time when the people are disappointed,” Benitez said of the angry Everton fans.
“It was a strange game. When we had control they scored. At the start of the second half another mistake from a corner. You cannot do that in the Premier League.”

Barca, who crashed out of the Champions League after finishing third in their group, will host Napoli in the first leg on Feb 17 before playing away a week later.
I’d say that our glass is completely full: Barcelona v Napoli and then Napoli v Barcelona will be two great matches at Champions League level!” tweeted Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis.
Napoli and Barca met in the last 16 of the 2019-20 Champions League, with Barca advancing 4-2 on aggregate.
The away goals rule has been removed from this season’s European competitions, so ties level after 180 minutes will go to extra time, and then penalties if needed.
Barca’s fellow LaLiga team Sevilla will face Croatia’s Dinamo Zagreb, while Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund will play against Scottish champions Rangers after the draw took place on Monday.
RB Leipzig will face Real Sociedad, Zenit St Petersburg will play Real Betis, while Moldovan minnows Sheriff Tiraspol were drawn against Sporting Braga.
Italian side Atalanta will take on Greek club Olympiakos Piraeus and Porto will face Lazio.
The winners of the eight ties will join the eight Europa League group winners in the last 16, the draw for which will be held on Feb 25. West Ham United, Monaco, Olympique Lyonnais and Bayer Leverkusen are among those teams.
In the third-tier Europa Conference League, English Premier League club Leicester City will face Danish side Randers and Scottish club Celtic will take on Norwegian champions Bodo/Glimt in the knockout playoff round.
Austrian club Rapid Vienna will face either England’s Tottenham Hotspur or Dutch team Vitesse Arnhem, depending on which one of the two teams advance.
Tottenham’s further participation in the competition is yet to be decided by European soccer governing body UEFA after their game against Stade Rennais was called off due to Covid-19 cases in the club. UEFA has said the game cannot be rescheduled. Vitesse are currently second in Group ‘G’ on 10 points after playing all six games, while Tottenham are third on seven points after five matches.
French club Olympique de Marseille will face Azeri side Qarabag, Dutch team PSV Eindhoven will take on Israeli club Maccabi Tel-Aviv and Turkey’s Fenerbahce will play Czech side Slavia Prague in other ties, which feature the group runners-up of the new competition against the eight third-placed teams dropping down from the Europa League.
The winners of the fixtures played over two legs on February 17 and 24 advance to the last 16, where they will be drawn against the eight Europa Conference League group winners.

4,Mbappe double gives PSG win over Monaco,"PARIS: Kylian Mbappe scored his 100th goal for Paris St Germain, netting a brace as the Ligue 1 leaders beat Monaco...","PARIS: Kylian Mbappe scored his 100th goal for Paris St Germain, netting a brace as the Ligue 1 leaders beat Monaco 2-0 on Sunday.
The France star, who scored twice midweek in the Champions League in a 4-1 win against Club Brugge, gave PSG the lead from the penalty spot and doubled his tally just before halftime from Lionel Messi’s assist.
At the age of 22 years and 357 days, Mbappe is the youngest player to score 100 goals for a single team in the French top flight, according to Opta’s analysis of statistics since 1950.
The comfortable win allowed PSG to extend their lead at the top of Ligue 1 to 13 points from Olympique de Marseille, who won 2-0 at Strasbourg earlier on Sunday and have a game in hand.
PSG had only a couple of chances in the first half and converted both as Mbappe showed no mercy for the club he helped to the league title in 2017.
The hosts were awarded a penalty after Djibril Sidibe fouled Angel Di Maria. Mbappe took the penalty and beat Monaco goalkeeper Alexander Nubel to break the deadlock in the 11th minute.
Messi initiated the counterattack that led to PSG’s second goal. The seven-time Ballon d’Or winner intercepted a pass, ran past defenders before setting up Mbappe, who curled a shot into the back of the net.
Marseille moved back up to second as their win at Strasbourg took them above Stade Rennais, who lost at home to Nice.
Young Senegalese striker Bamba Dieng put Marseille ahead in Alsace with an acrobatic volleyed finish just after the hour. Duje Caleta-Car headed in a Dimitri Payet corner late on to seal the points.
Kasper Dolberg scored one goal and set up another as Nice won 2-1 at Rennes in a clash between two clubs with Champions League ambitions.
Nice started the campaign strongly before stumbling in recent weeks but they went ahead in Brittany when Dolberg converted a 19th-minute penalty awarded for a foul on Dante.
Denmark striker Dolberg then teed up Youcef Atal to score the second in the 51st minute.
Benjamin Bourigeaud pulled one back for Rennes but Nice held on to close to within a point of Rennes in the table.
Reigning champions Lille, fresh from qualifying for the last 16 of the Champions League, were held to a 0-0 draw at home by Olympique Lyonnais, a result which leaves both clubs in mid-table.
Metz secured an emphatic 4-1 win over fellow strugglers Lorient to leapfrog their rivals in the relegation zone.
Metz’s first win at home this season lifted the club to 18th in the standings, level on points with Lorient.
Angers were upset 1-0 at home by Clermont while Girondins Bordeaux won 2-1 at Troyes.

BERLIN: Bayer Leverkusen threw away a two-goal lead to lose 5-2 at Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday and miss the chance to put pressure on the Bundesliga leaders, while Greuther Fuerth celebrated a historic 1-0 win over Union Berlin.
Leverkusen’s defeat is another boost to table-topping Bayern Munich, who extended their lead to six points on Saturday when they beat Mainz 05 and second-placed Borussia Dortmund drew at Bochum.
Two early goals from Patrick Schick briefly seemed to have put Leverkusen in control but Brazilian defender Tuta soon responded with a volleyed goal for Eintracht before Jesper Lindstrom equalised on a counterattack.
Evan Ndicka gave Eintracht the lead for the first time in the 50th minute on a rebound before Kristijan Jakic and Djibril Sow extended their lead. Leverkusen stay third after missing a chance to move to within a point of Dortmund, while Frankfurt rose three places to ninth.
Promoted Fuerth finally achieved a historic win in the Bundesliga, but no fans were there to see it.
Norwegian striker Havard Nielsen’s goal was enough for Fuerth to beat Union for their first win of the season, though they stay last. They remain 12 points adrift of safety at the bottom of the table, while high-flying Union missed the chance to leapfrog Freiburg into fifth.—Agencies

6,"Rizwan, Haider inspire Pakistan to big win over West Indies in first T20","KARACHI: It proved to be a mis-match in the end. Just as it had looked on paper.

A second-string West Indies...","KARACHI: It proved to be a mis-match in the end. Just as it had looked on paper.
A second-string West Indies couldn’t really put any resistance to a high-flying Pakistan, who made it a fourth straight Twenty20 International victory since losing to Australia in the semi-finals of the Twenty20 World Cup.
Opener Mohammad Rizwan continued his rich vein of form with a 52-ball 78 and Haider Ali hit 68 off 39 as Pakistan pulverised the West Indies by 63 runs to the joy of their home crowd at the National Stadium in their three-match T20 series opener here on Monday. Haider for his powerful batting was named man-of-the-match.
Put into bat, Pakistan amassed 200-6 before the West Indies, forced to draft in two players from their ODI squad after losing three of their players due to positive Covid-19 tests, were dismissed for 137 with pacer Mohammad Wasim Jr claiming a career-best 4-40.
On a nippy winter evening, Pakistan got off to the worst possible start when skipper Babar Azam was caught behind off Akeal Hossain on a delivery that turned sharply and got the edge on its way to Shai Hope on the fourth ball of the innings.
It was a start for the tourists that seemed to justify Nicolas Pooran’s decision to field after winning the toss and Pakistan’s first boundary only came on the final delivery of the second over; Fakhar Zaman cutting Oshane Thomas over point.
That saw Rizwan cut loose and put away debutant Dominic Drakes for four in the next over before hitting Thomas for successive boundaries in the following over.
Fakhar tried to keep up that momentum in the fifth over but was caught at long-on off the bowling of Romario Shepherd for 10.
Rizwan, though, continued to saunter on and drove Drakes through covers for another four before pulling Odean Smith for another boundary. Haider got his first boundary in the same over by Smith and the partnership was on.
Rizwan completed his half-century in the 10th over — his 12th in T20s overall and 11th in this calendar year — and celebrated it with a boundary through backward point as Pakistan reached 75-2 at the halfway point of their innings.
He then got a lucky boundary in the 11th over, this time his one-handed shot slicing over short third man and going all the way to the fence.
It was in the 12th over bowled by Smith where the ball was hit to all parts of the ground. 
The first ball, a yorker, got an inside edge and went through Haider’s legs and beyond the reach of short fine leg.
Rizwan’s leading edge of the third ball flew over backward point and to the boundary before Haider got the first six of the innings over the mid-wicket boundary on the fifth and finished off the over with a four thanks to an outside edge that evaded short third man.
Runs were coming freely for Pakistan and Rizwan pulled Thomas for four on a free-hit to start the 12th over.
At the other end, Haider cut Drakes over point for his second six and then slashed over the point fielder for another boundary. He reached his fifty with his third six — powering the ball over deep mid-wicket — in the 15th over.
Rizwan, though, went in the next over after he couldn’t get his full blade on Romario Shepherd’s delivery and ended up hoisting it towards deep mid-wicket where Smith claimed it on the run.
It ended a partnership that yielded 105 runs off 63 balls, setting Pakistan on their way to a score in excess of 200.
With Asif Ali at the crease, the sparse home fans were expecting more fireworks especially after the power-hitter had shown his prowess at the recent Twenty20 World Cup in the UAE.
But he departed without troubling the scorers much and Iftikhar Ahmed soon followed.
Haider got his fourth six to end the 18th over before Mohammad Nawaz (30 not out) got on the act in the penultimate over, hitting boundaries through the offside off the first, fourth and fifth deliveries before hitting a six straight down the ground off the final ball with Pakistan at 189 at that point.
Haider was dismissed in the final over, finding Smith on long-on as he tried to push Pakistan to 200. But that was never in doubt with Nawaz at the crease. A flat six over long-off took Pakistan to 199 and they finished on 200 when Nawaz collected a single off the last ball.
Hope gave the West Indies some hope in their chase when he drove Pakistan’s ace pacer Shaheen Shah Afridi for four with a cracking cover drive in the first over but Nawaz had his fellow opener Brandon King caught off the very next ball by Babar at cover.
Captain Pooran came to the crease and hit two sixes and a four in an 18-run knock before seeing his stumps uprooted by a yorker from Wasim.
Wasim got his second wicket when he caught Devon Thomas plumb in front of his wicket before Shadab Khan ended West Indies hopes with two wickets in four balls in the 10th over.
Hope went for a sweep but the ball hit him just below the knee roll and he was gone for 31 before debutant Shamarh Brooks was bowled as West Indies struggled to 60-5 in the first 10 overs.
Powell tried to give the West Indies some hope when he hit Shadab for a four and a six in the 12th over and was lucky to survive when Babar dropped him at first slip. 
Having seen Drakes dismissed off the first ball of the 13th over, Powell hit Haris Rauf for a six in the same over before being sent to the pavilion by Shadab.
With the asking rate climbing. Shepherd hit Wasim for two boundaries and a six in the 15th over but West Indies still needed 95 off the last five overs.
Shepherd and Smith hit a few lusty blows but it was not enough as Waseem and Shaheen had stumps flying late on.

7,Mahela Jayawardene appointed Sri Lanka's consultant coach,"Jayawardene’s one-year contract will begin on Jan 1, according to Sri Lanka Cricket.","COLOMBO: Sri Lanka has appointed former captain Mahela Jayawardene as a consultant coach for its national cricket teams of different levels after his impactful role during the first stage of the recently-concluded T20 World Cup, the cricket board said on Monday.
Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) said Jayawardene’s one-year contract will begin on Jan 1 and he will work with players and coaches for both the senior team and youth teams at the national high performance center.
“We are extremely happy that Mahela is joining the national team for an extended role, especially given the context that Sri Lanka has a heavy international calendar during the year 2022,” the SLC quoted its chief executive, Ashley De Silva, as saying.
“Mahela’s contributions during the first round of the ICC T20 World Cup became invaluable for the overall performances of our team in the concluded event,” de Silva said.
Sri Lanka’s low ranking meant the team had to play a qualifying round just to reach the T20 World Cup that concluded last month in the UAE, despite having won the tournament in 2014.
Sri Lanka played against Namibia, Ireland and Netherlands in qualifying and won comfortably and Jayawardene, who worked as a consultant during that stage, was credited with boosting the team’s low confidence levels.
Sri Lanka also surpassed expectations in the main tournament, defeating the West Indies and competing well with leading teams like England, South Africa and eventual champions Australia.
Jayawardene played for Sri Lanka in 652 international matches across three formats and scored 25,957 runs. He was reputed as a strategic captain and a thinker.
He captained Sri Lanka in the 50-over World Cup in 2007, when the team lost to Australia in the final. 
He was part of the 2011 World Cup team which again finished runners-up, and the team that won the T20 World Cup in 2014.

“I am very passionate about Sri Lankan cricket and believe that with a coordinated and focused team effort, taking a holistic approach working across all age groups, we can achieve consistent success in the future,” Jayawardene said.

Faisal will formally assume charge in January 2022.
According to the PCB, Faisal is the UK-qualified chartered accountant holding a professional career of over 35 years in high-profile finance and sports administration roles with some of the world’s leading blue-chip organisations. This includes his role in Monaco and Dubai as the chief financial officer of the International Cricket Council (ICC) and as the managing director of Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC).
As ICC’s chief financial officer, Faisal managed an overall financial portfolio of around $3 billion and was also involved in the sale of ICC’s commercial rights for the 2007-2015 and the 2016-2023 commercial cycles. With Zimbabwe Cricket, he was instrumental in the refinancing of their commercial debts, arriving at the financial arrangements between ZC and the ICC, securing ZC’s funding and status within the ICC and securing hosting rights for the ICC World Cup Qualifier 2018 — Zimbabwe’s first global event in 15 years.
PCB chairman Ramiz Raja welcomed Faisal’s appointment.

9,IBA pledges reform to win back Olympic spot for 2028,The International Olympic Committee is concerned by allegations of widespread fixing in Olympic bouts and other IBA events.,"LAUSANNE: Boxing will reform a judging system tainted by manipulation to regain its place on the programme for the 2028 Olympics, the president of the newly renamed International Boxing Association (IBA) said on Monday.
Boxing, weightlifting and modern pentathlon were all left off the initial list of sports for the 2028 Los Angeles Games last week and were asked to make changes by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The IOC is concerned by allegations of widespread fixing in Olympic bouts and other IBA events, as reported by an investigation conducted at the IBA’s request over the last two years. The IOC organised this year’s Olympic boxing tournament itself in Tokyo after excluding the IBA.
“We have nothing to hide,” IBA president Umar Kremlev said of the investigation’s findings, which said referees and judges were pressured to manipulate Olympic bouts in 2016 but couldn’t be certain which specific fights were fixed.
“We need to deal with this and draw up a plan of action which will help lead to our reinstatement at the IOC session in 2023 [when the 2028 programme will be decided]. We need to continue to improve our administration. We implemented new forms of administration less than 72 hours after the IOC told us about [removal from the 2028 programme].”
An IBA congress voted on Sunday to change the association’s branding from its old initials AIBA, give member federations a say more often, and to set up an independent integrity unit.
Kremlev said of suspect judges and referees: “If their guilt is proved they will be banned for life and not even allowed to attend boxing as spectators.”
Boxing was first on the Olympic programme in 1904 and has featured in every edition of the Summer Games since 1920.

10,Rohit Sharma ruled out of Test series against South Africa,Rohit picked up an injury to his left hamstring during a training session in Mumbai last week.,"NEW DELHI: India batsman Rohit Sharma has been ruled out of the three-Test series against South Africa due to a hamstring injury and will be replaced by Priyank Panchal, the country’s cricket board (BCCI) said on Monday.
Rohit, who replaced Virat Kohli as India’s white-ball skipper last week, picked up the injury to his left hamstring during a training session in Mumbai on Sunday.
Panchal, 31, was part of the India ‘A’ side that played in a three-match unofficial test series in South Africa earlier this month.
The first Test is scheduled to start in Pretoria from Dec 26.
Meanwhile, the home team’s wicket-keeper/batter Quinton de Kock could also miss the second and third Test matches, with his wife expecting the birth of their child in early January, ESPN Cricinfo website reported on Monday.
The second Test is set to start on Jan 3 in Johannesburg while the final Test is scheduled for Jan 11 in Cape Town. The teams will then play three ODIs.
De Kock last featured for South Africa at the T20 World Cup in the UAE, where he opted to sit out their second group game following a board order to take a knee in support of the  “Black Lives Matter” movement.
He later apologised for his decision and took a knee in the following three matches as South Africa were knocked out in the Super 12 stage of the competition.

11,"Goalkeepers Amjad, Mazhar reach Dhaka one day before Pakistan’s opening match",The Asian Champions Trophy commences in the Bangladesh capital on Tuesday.,"LAHORE: Just one day before their first match against Japan in the Asian Champions Trophy, Pakistan hockey team’s senior goalkeepers Amjad Ali and Mazhar Abbas joined the national squad in Dhaka on Monday after getting their visas late on Sunday.
According to the Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF), both the players left for Dhaka in the wee hours of Monday soon after getting the visas late on Sunday and had reached Dhaka.
The Asian Champions Trophy commences in the Bangladesh capital on Tuesday.
First, the national selection committee headed by Manzoor Junior had included two goalkeepers of the national junior team —  Waqar Ahmad and Abdullah — who participated in the Junior World Cup in Bhubaneswar, India where Pakistan earned a poor 11th place.
But the below-par performance of the two junior goalies forced the PHF  to apply for the visas for the senior goalkeeping duo.
However, the participation of the senior goalkeepers in Dhaka depends on the permission from the technical officials of the tournament whose meeting was going on when this report was being filed.
It may be mentioned here that the PHF could not get the visas of goalkeeping coach Ahmad Alam, trainer Abid Amin and physio Aslam due to which the Pakistan squad may face problems during the event in Dhaka.
Moreover, two Pakistan officials for the Dhaka tournament — Haroon Rasheed (umpire) and Hasan Akhter (technical official) — could not get visas too. It is also learnt that assistant coach Ajmal Khan Lodhi did not accompany the Pakistan squad.

12,"PSG get Real, United to face Atletico in revised CL last-16 draw",PSG’s initial draw with United was a highly anticipated battle between Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.,"NYON: Paris St Germain will face Real Madrid in a titanic clash in the last 16 of the Champions League while Manchester United take on Atletico Madrid after UEFA declared the original draw void due to a technical error in the process on Monday.
Earlier, United were mistakenly drawn with Villarreal, even though both teams had already faced each other in the group stage while the Premier League side’s ball was not added to the bowl as a potential opponent for Atletico Madrid.
United were eventually drawn with PSG while Atletico drew Bayern Munich before the draw was scrapped after the Spanish side complained and UEFA admitted the error.
PSG’s initial draw with United was a highly anticipated battle between Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi — the competition’s two top goal scorers.
The pair have won 12 of the last 13 Ballon d’Or awards for player of the year — with Messi leading 7-5 after victory in 2021.
Instead, Messi will now face a familiar opponent in Real Madrid, against whom he has scored 26 times in all competitions when he was at Barcelona.
Real Madrid had also attempted to prise French forward Kylian Mbappe from PSG in the close season but ultimately failed after the Ligue 1 side rejected their bids.
United’s Ronaldo, meanwhile, will relish a tie against Atletico having scored 25 goals against them for Real and Juventus.
Liverpool take on Inter Milan with another trip to the San Siro after Jurgen Klopp’s side beat AC Milan twice in the group stage.
“I had to wait 54 years to play at the San Siro for the first time... and now it’ll be twice in three months, so that’s good news,” Klopp told the Liverpool website.
“Of course, it is a tough draw, definitely. They are the league leaders in Italy; a good team in a good moment.”
Klopp added UEFA did the right thing in redoing the draw.
“I saw it live and I thought, ‘You cannot let it stand like this, there’s no chance.’ Definitely, they had to do it again.”  
Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola also agreed a redraw was the right course of action.
“I think it’s fair,” he said.  “It was a mistake and these kind of things sometimes happen... [a redraw] makes sense so there are no suspicions.”
Last year’s runners-up City face Sporting Lisbon while Juventus, who topped their group above Chelsea, face Villarreal.
Holders Chelsea will face French champions Lille, just as they were drawn in the original draw, while six-times champions Bayern Munich will now face RB Salzburg — the first Austrian side to qualify for the knockout stages.
Benfica, who initially drew Real Madrid, will now play high-flying Ajax Amsterdam who impressed in the group stage by winning all six matches.
UEFA also experienced technical issues while conducting the third-tier Conf­erence League draw later.
The first legs are scheduled to take place on Feb 15-16 and Feb 22-23  while the second legs will be played on March 8-9 and March 15-16.
