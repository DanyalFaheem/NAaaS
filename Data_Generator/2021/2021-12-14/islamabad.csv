0,Wasa asks Punjab to bear only 25pc cost of Ghazi Barotha water project,"Rawalpindi to get 25pc share of water with 50pc going to Islamabad and remaining to cantonment boards, says official.","RAWALPINDI: The Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) has recommended that the Punjab government bear only 25 per cent cost of construction, feasibility study and land acquisition of the Ghazi Barotha project to bring water from Indus River to Rawalpindi and Islamabad.
A senior official of Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) told Dawn that Wasa had sent a summary to Chief Minister Usman Buzdar through the RDA with a recommendation to share only 25pc cost of the project. He explained that the city under the administrative control of the provincial government will get only 25pc share of water with 50pc going to Islamabad and the remaining 25pc to the cantonment boards.
He said the Capital Development Authority (CDA) had asked the Punjab government through Wasa to equally share the project cost as 100 million gallons daily (MGD) each would be provided to Islamabad and Rawalpindi.
Accordingly, PC-I for land acquisition amounting to Rs3.154 billion was prepared by the CDA which was considered by the Central Development Working Party (CDWP) on June 6, 2020, and cleared in principle with certain directions, including the finalisation of financing mechanism with stakeholders.

City to get 25pc share of water with 50pc going to Islamabad and remaining to cantonment boards, says official

Since the project cost as well as the water is to be equally shared by the federal and the Punjab governments for Rawalpindi, the CDA requested provision of funds amounting to Rs1.577 billion for land acquisition.
However, the CDA was told that 100 MGD share proposed for Rawalpindi city was further distributed between the cantonment boards and Rawalpindi city (Wasa service area) at the 50:50 ratio.
The cantonment boards are administratively controlled by the federal government and funds to them are also provided by Islamabad. Therefore, the Punjab government through Wasa will only contribute 25pc cost of the project.
In April 2005, the CDA assigned a study to MS MM Pakistan and MS Mott MacDonald, UK. This scheme was principally approved by the Punjab chief minister in 2006.
The consultants studied seven locations for abstraction of water and construction of intake structure. The conduction of water from Ghazi Barotha Lake was found as the most optimal choice to meet the present demand and future requirements of the twin cities.
The Council of Common Interest (CCI) in June 2011 approved the water allocation for Rawalpindi for Phase-l of the project out of the share of the Punjab. The water allocation for Islamabad was approved by the CCI on March 29, 2016.
All efforts have been made by CDA as well as Wasa and RDA in the past for arranging foreign as well as local funding for the project considering its cost. However, by one reason or the other, none of them got success. The federal government has now revived the project on the directions of Prime Minister Imran Khan.
A senior official of Wasa told Dawn that the present water supply to the Wasa service area was 51 MGD from all sources - Rawal Dam (10 million gallons), Khanpur Dam (six million gallons) and 480 tubewells (35 million gallons).
“The present sources are not enough to cater to the future requirement of the growing population of Rawalpindi city which is presently more than two million. Drinking water availability position in Islamabad and Rawalpindi cantonment boards is also very alarming. They are mainly dependent on Simly and Khanpur water reservoirs,” he said.
When contacted, Wasa Managing Director Raja Shaukat Mehmood said the only solution to the water shortage in Rawalpindi and Islamabad was a project to bring water from the Indus River.
He said Wasa had informed the CDA that the city area will get 25pc share of water so the provincial government will share 25pc cost of the project. However, he said the government would make a decision in this regard soon.

RAWALPINDI: Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmad on Monday said the Federal Investigation Agency’s Cyber Crime wing will be strengthened to meet the challenges while 509 people would be recruited out of the 1.2 million applicants and 2,000 people for the Capital Police.
The federal minister was talking to media persons during his visit to under-construction Mother and Child Hospital (M&CH) on Monday.
“Recruitments would be made on merit,” said the interior minister, adding that the recruitment process would take time.
He said Prime Minister Imran Khan would inaugurate Mother and Child Hospital on February 28, 2022 which was being completed at the cost of Rs6 million.
The minister said that M&CH, Ring road and Nullah Leh Expressway would be completed during the tenure of PTI’s government, adding that 90 per cent of work on the hospital had been completed.
Sheikh Rashid further said the Provincial Central Development Working Party (CDWP) had approved the Leh Expressway project at Rs150 billion, on which work would be started after the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) approval.
Replying to a question about the PDM long march on March 23, the minister said that everybody knew that on March 23, the national parade was to be held in Islamabad and before the parade; roads were to be closed for preparation.
Rashid said that he had asked the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) to come to the federal capital on March 30, adding no one would be allowed to take the law into hands, and if they did, the law would take its course.
He further said that only those who come under the flag of Pakistan and take responsibility for living in peace can be talked to. But at this stage the talks have not reached any decisive stage.
“We are moving towards e-passport. All corruption online visas have been eliminated,” he claimed.
He said that the opposition alliance should have remembered that Pakistan Day parade is being held on March 23 in Islamabad and they will not allow anyone take the law into their own hands.

3,Education ministers to decide date of winter vacations today,A ministry official said government wanted to defer winter vacation till January so ongoing vaccination drives could be completed.,"ISLAMABAD: The education ministers of the country will decide the date of winter vacations and implementation of political map in educational institutions on Tuesday (today).
According to a notification issued by the education ministry, the 34th meeting of Inter Provincial Education Ministers Conference (IPEMC) will be held on Tuesday to discuss several things including vaccination of children between the age group of 12 to 18 and shifting of winter vacations to January 2022.
An official of the ministry said that the government wanted to defer the winter vacation till January so that ongoing vaccination drives could be completed. However, he said that the final decision will be taken up by education ministers.
It is relevant to note here that the Sindh government has already announced winter vacations in educational institutions from Dec 20 to Jan 3. Participants of the said meeting will also discuss full enforcement of political map in provincial educational setup.
Educational institutions have already been teaching using the new political map of the country, which was introduced by the federal government, a couple of years ago.
“But, the ministers will discuss if the political map is completely enforced in all provincial educational setups”, the officer said.
The government had on Aug 4 last year unveiled the country’s new political map, essentially asserting its longstanding position on the Kashmir and Sir Creek disputes.
Prime Minister Imran Khan, while introducing the map at a ceremony had pointed out that it reflected the national aspiration and supported principled stance on the Kashmir dispute.
The new map was made public a day before Pakistan observed the first anniversary of annexation of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK). India annexed the held territory on Aug 5, 2019 by revoking articles 370 and 35A of its constitution, which had provided special status to occupied Kashmir and rights and privileges to Kashmiris.
The prime minister had pointed out that it would now be the official map after being approved by the federal cabinet and would be the one used in schools and colleges.
The map clearly identifies occupied Kashmir as a disputed territory and states that the final status will be decided in line with relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions.
The map rejects illegal steps taken by India, PM Khan said, adding that the federal cabinet and the country’s political leadership had supported it.

4,SC continues hearing on review petitions of sacked employees,"Court to hear other lawyers after AGP’s arguments, says Justice Bandial","

ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Monday adjourned till Tuesday the hearing of review petitions filed by the federal government and the sacked employees against its judgement declaring the Sacked Employees (Reinstatement) Act 2010 ultra vires of the Constitution.
A five-member larger bench, headed by Justice Umar Ata Bandial and comprising Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Sajjad Ali Shah, Justice Qazi Mohammad Amin and Justice Aminuddin Khan, heard the review petitions.
During the course of proceedings, Justice Bandial said the court would hear other lawyers after hearing the arguments of Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Khalid Jawed Khan.
The AGP said he had submitted written synopsis in the case. These employees were fired under a letter dated Nov 7, 1996, from the Establishment Division.

Court to hear other lawyers after AGP’s arguments, says Justice Bandial

Justice Mansoor asked employees of how many departments had been affected by the decision of the Supreme Court?
The AGP said around 16 departments’ 16,000 employees had been affected while the Establishment Division claimed that the number of affected employees was 5,000.
He said the employees were recruited between 1993 and 1996 and fired at different times until 1999.
When Justice Bandial asked did the law entitle the employees to pension, the AGP responded that according to his opinion they would not be entitled to pension.
Justice Bandial asked whether the employees recruited under the ordinance and the Act were permanent or daily wagers. The AGP replied that most of the employees were permanent.
He said the employees had challenged their seniority in courts.
The Supreme Court issued notice to the attorney general on the petitions but it was not a notice under Article 27-A.
Justice Mansoor said the high court had not ruled on the ordinance or the Act.
Justice Bandial said issuance of a notice was a formality but the court decided the case after hearing the attorney general’s office. The Constitution empowers the apex court to deliver justice, he added.
He said the affected employees were not recruited under any procedure and the apex court in its decision had also examined the recruitment procedure. He said there should be a criterion for recruitment on government posts.
Justice Mansoor said all the employees were not fired under a letter or a government order. It was true that the employees had no role in the unconstitutional legislation, he added.
He said the restoration law could not be re-enacted as the court had ruled over the matter. Parliament could give any relief to the employees on 10 years of service, he added.
The AGP said parliament was defending the Act through the government and him (AGP).
Justice Qazi Amin asked could there be a system of governance beyond the Constitution? The government had earlier opposed the reinstatement of the employees while in the review petition it wanted to reinstate the employees, he added.
The AGP said three daughters of a sacked employee were expelled from school for non-payment of fees. He said he knew that courts took decisions based on the law, not popularity. If the same case had come up in 2010, he would have opposed the reinstatement of the employees, he added.
Upon this, Justice Sajjad said he (AGP) was acknowledging that the reinstatement law was unconstitutional.

6,Hassanabdal villages lack basic health facilities,"BHU set up over 30 years ago without sufficient staff and medicine, say locals","TAXILA: Despite the much-publicised health reforms claimed by the PTI government, paucity of medicines, facilities, staff and poor infrastructure are taking its heavy toll on the health of people in rural area of Hassanabdal.
The residents of more than nine villages in the Kot Sondkai union council in Hassanabdal tehsil do not have access to basic healthcare facilities. The Basic Health Unit (BHU) established in 1989 was supposed to meet the basic healthcare requirements of the general population.
But one male medical officer, a lady health visitor, a dispenser and a watchman deputed at the centre are unable to meet the over 45,000 population.
Most of the villagers cannot afford taking their ailing family members to major hospitals located in Attock, Wah and Rawalpindi.

BHU set up over 30 years ago without sufficient staff and medicine, say locals

Asghar Ali, a resident of the area, said it is a lifeline for thousands of nearby residents, many of whom cannot afford expensive treatment. Since the centre lacks facilities, people have to visit the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital located 25 kilometres away, he said. With the provision of medicines, staff and ambulances, the centre could address the needs of the population.
Sultana Shaheen, a teacher, said the much publicised Chief Minister Punjab Health Reforms Programme seemed a distant dream for the residents of this area as the health unit lacked basic facilities and medicines. She said a female medical officer should be appointed at the health facility to save the lives of hundreds of pregnant women.
Dr Ikram Ullah Khan, the incharge of the health unit, said that with one male medical officer, one dispenser, one lady health worker and one watchman, the BHU is supposed to cater to the basic healthcare requirements of the general population, which consists mostly of agricultural labourers, and provide a safe delivery centre for pregnant women. He said since its construction no maintenance or renovation work had been carried out. He said upgrading the BHU to the rural health centre (RHC) would benefit the residents.
He said that if the rehabilitation of the adjacent accommodation of the unit was made, it would prove better for the residents as trained staff would be available.
Munnaza Peerzada, President of a local NGO, said that a survey of the villages showed that maternal mortality and morbidity rate is high and even deaths from preventable diseases were common.
Dr Saeed Ahmed, chairman of another NGO, said the pandemic exposed the healthcare system in rural areas. He said the pandemic exposed the deteriorating condition of health centres and lack of medical infrastructure in villages.
When contacted, Chief Executive Officer District Health Authority Dr Mohsin Ashraf confirmed the poor condition of the health unit. He said issues related to the health unit were under the notice of the district health department and repair as well as rehabilitation work would be carried out when adequate funds are made available.
He added that a proposal to rehabilitate the centre had been forwarded to the provincial authorities and it will be made operative for round-the-clock healthcare services after sanction of staff and funding.

11,PTI lawmakers in AJK deny rifts in party,Clarification comes a day after luncheon hosted by AJK President Sultan Mahmood invited 30 out of 32 parliamentary party members.,"MUZAFFARABAD: In what appeared to be a damage-control attempt, ten members of the parliamentary party of PTI in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) asserted in a joint statement on Monday that there was no friction in the ruling party and all were unitedly working under the leadership of Prime Minister Sardar Abdul Qayyum Niazi.
The clarification was issued a day after a luncheon meeting was hosted by AJK President Barrister Sultan Mahmood for the PTI parliamentary party at his camp office in Kashmir House.
The presidency had extended the invitation for the midday meal to 30 out of 32 parliamentary party members, while leaving out PM Niazi and senior minister Sardar Tanveer Ilyas, but only 17 had made it to the event, including 10 ministers and one adviser.
A press release issued by the presidency following the meeting had claimed that the participants had complained, among other things, about being ignored by the prime minister in affairs related to their respective constituencies.
On his part, President Mahmood had also expressed dissatisfaction over the government’s performance by observing that neither it could create goodwill among the masses nor were the PTI workers satisfied with it.
He had particularly stressed upon PM Niazi to fulfil his responsibilities for the improvement in the working of his government so as to make headway in accordance with the vision of PTI chairman and Prime Minister Imran Khan.
However, on Monday, the Press Information Department released a joint statement by 10 out of the 17 participants of Sunday’s event in which they asserted that they had attended the luncheon meeting with the permission of Prime Minister Niazi.
Those who had purportedly issued the joint statement included seven ministers, one adviser and two parliamentary secretaries.
“Prime minister [Niazi] is our team captain and the entire parliamentary party stands behind him like a solid rock. We are utilising all resources under his [Mr Niazi’s] leadership for development of the [AJK] territory and implementation of the vision of Prime Minister Imran Khan.”
The PTI lawmakers further clarified that yesterday’s event was not a “meeting against the government” but a formal lunch arranged by the president “where discussions on AJK’s development, local body elections and the situation in India occupied Kashmir were held.”
“There is no divide whatsoever in the ranks of PTI.. Media reports to this effect are baseless,” they said.
They said Mr Niazi was a seasoned politician and their foremost priority under his command was to “develop AJK , point out public issues and accomplish under-construction projects.”

He was told that two slip roads (one from Park Road to Faizabad side) and one which goes towards the roundabout have already been slightly opened for traffic.
The chairman told officials that all four slip roads should be carpeted and opened for traffic this month.
According to a press release issued by the authority, the chairman also directed officers concerned to install reflectors around the interchange site to facilitate commuters.
It added that the due date for completion of this project is October 2022 but it is likely that this project will be completed earlier by June 2022 whereas the flyover part of the interchange will most probably be completed by January/ February 2022.
The CDA chief also inspected the under-construction 7th Avenue project, which according to PC-I, is supposed to be completed in October.
“Chairman directed the departments concerned to complete the bridge (a component of the project, which will be an elevated bridge on Srinagar Highway) by February 2022 and open it for traffic while he also directed to complete the construction of 7th Avenue Interchange by August 2022,” the press release said, adding October 2022 is the original date of completion of this project.
This interchange is being executed at the junction of 7th Avenue, Srinagar Highway, Khayaban-i-Suharwardi and Garden Avenue. The junction was considered one of the busiest junctions, where traffic jams are common.
“In order to maintain the flow of traffic, instructions were issued that CDA and traffic police officers should work out a traffic diversion plan so that citizens do not face any difficulty and also save the citizens from wasting precious time. Instructions were also issued to display traffic diversion signs at prominent places for public guidance and alternative routes,” the press release said, adding that the chairman has directed the Environment Wing to select suitable sites and plant as many trees as possible.
Furthermore, the statement said, the CDA administration directed the departments concerned to expedite work and use all resources to complete both projects on time so that citizens do not face traffic congestion.

Accountability judge Mohammad Bashir will announce the decision on December 17.
According to the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) record, National Crime Agency, UK, through the regional manager of the National Crime Agency, British High Commission, Islamabad, in a letter dated Aug 7, 2017, asserted that Nisar Ahmad Afzal and his brother Saghir Ahmad Afzal were involved in the £60 million mortgage fraud in UK in 2004-06.
It was alleged that Saghir dishonestly obtained mortgages secured on six pieces of real property. These properties were purchased at arm’s length for a total of £6,885,625.
Each was then transferred between, or by use of, companies controlled by Saghir and Nisar at prices inflated to between five and 16 times the original price.
NAB earlier stated that on the basis of the grossly inflated prices, Saghir and Nisar applied for, and obtained, mortgage advances totaling £49,276,250.
The accused controlled all the relevant transactions, directly or through agents and intermediaries, and gave instructions as to the distribution of the fraudulently obtained money.
According to the UK authorities, the evidence was so compelling that Saghir pleaded guilty on January 17, 2011, (the first day of his trial) whereby he was sentenced by a UK court on June 14, 2011, to undergo 13 years in prison.
Nisar fled to Pakistan along with part of the proceeds (around £26 million), the application said.
After receipt of complaint and information from UK authorities, an inquiry was authorised by the competent authority against the accused persons in terms of offences of corruption and corrupt practices, it added.
However, Raja Aleem Abbasi, the counsel for the accused persons, argued before the court that the British authorities had cleared the two brothers.
He said the warrants issued against them had already been withdrawn.
He argued that since the cause of action in the case was no more, the court may order to unfreeze the properties of the accused persons.

He was addressing the swearing-in ceremony of the newly-elected officials of the Employees Welfare Association of the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (BISE), Rawalpindi.
The minister said instead of taking a test of the students’ memory, the examination process should be of checking creativity, decision making and critical thinking of the students.
He said at present, the information technology industry in Punjab needed 30,000 professionals, but graduates of required qualifications were not available and keeping these realities in mind, plans were being made to reform the education and examination system.
No examination fee would be levied on students of government schools while workshops would be organised to train teachers of private educational institutions affiliated with examination boards.
Mr Humayun lauded the BISE for overcoming the financial deficit by improving administrative matters. Speaking on the occasion, Rawalpindi Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education Chairman Dr Ghulam Dastgir said students’ problems were being solved at the earliest and one-window operation had been introduced for this purpose.
He noted that the Rawalpindi board was number one in Punjab from 2019, while more than 250 private educational institutions have been affiliated with the board. He said tickets would be affixed for verification of credentials in the style of Higher Education Commission (HEC).

PMC says results of foreign graduates highlight concerns about education quality in non-English speaking countries

“A complete list of national and international medical colleges with the number of graduates attempting the NLE step 1 (medical) from each institution and the number of candidates passing the exam is now available on the PMC website,” he said.
“The results of the Pakistani graduates are heartening and qualifying the NLE is a fair indicator of the level of clinical training imparted in the colleges, producing a high percentage of successful results,” he said.
“The result of foreign graduates has once again highlighted concerns of the commission as to the quality of education and especially clinical training being offered by many foreign medical colleges especially in the non-English speaking countries where there has been a mushroom growth of medical colleges offering offshore medical programmes based on a curriculum which does not follow the locally recognised qualification for obtaining a licence in these foreign countries.”
The spokesperson said the PMC had time and again stressed the importance of quality education and proper clinical training to pursue a career in medicine.
He said the NLE highlights the standard of national and international colleges and the steps that need to be taken to improve the standard of medical education by promoting meritocracy and transparency.
