0,No decline in Sindh's dengue cases despite drop in temperature,"""I think there will be a visible drop in cases as the city’s temperature drops further,” says a health department spokesperson.","KARACHI: Dengue fever remains a serious public health concern in the province despite the onset of winter as the mosquito-borne viral disease claimed three lives in five days with 441 new cases in less than two weeks, sources told Dawn. 
Two deaths were reported in Karachi while one in Hyderabad.
The victims include a 44-year-old doctor of the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, a 23-year-old man whose death was reported at Liaquat University Hospital in Hyderabad and a five-year-old girl, resident of Karachi.
An analysis of the health department data showed that there was no significant drop in dengue cases since October.
There were 2,065 cases reported in October, 1,887 in November and 441 dengue cases this month till Dec 12. Four deaths were reported in November.

Five-year-old among three dead in five days 

In Karachi, the districts which reported a high number of cases last month were district East with 327 cases, district Central 304 and district Korangi 247 cases.
In other parts of Sindh, Hyderabad reported 403 cases followed by Tharparkar 95 and Umerkot 43 last month.
Speaking to Dawn, health department spokesperson Atif Vighio admitted that the number of dengue cases had been consistent over the past two months.
“I think the reduction in cases is slow, particularly in Karachi. I think there will be a visible drop in cases as the city’s temperature drops further,” he said, insisting that the department did intervene on a case-to-case basis and had also initiated a public awareness drive on dengue fever threats.
Sudden drop in platelet level
“The virus has mutated over the years that explains why we are still seeing so many dengue fever cases despite change in the weather. Unfortunately, people are not taking this fever seriously,” said Dr Abdul Ghafoor Shoro, a senior general physician practicing in Korangi.
He pointed out that the illness was more severe now than before and needed immediate medical attention.
“Earlier, there had been a gradual drop in platelet level. But, now there is a sudden drop that endangers life. In a recent case, I saw platelet level in a patient reduced from 258,000 to 41,000 in three days,” he said, adding that the JPMC doctor went through the same condition and died a few days back.
Dr Shoro emphasised the need for public awareness and action. 
“People must get tested for dengue if they develop a sore throat and fever and take their illness seriously. Second, improving the hygiene condition of the area you live in is a shared responsibility. We must take ownership of our localities and ensure that there are no mosquito breeding grounds.”
He warned that poor patient management by any (unqualified) doctor as well as self-medication, including use of antibiotics, steroids and even some common medicines, which in fact lowered platelet level, might complicate the case, causing death.
Dengue mosquitoes, according to experts, are generally active between the time period of August-October, and cases decline with the advent of winter.

2,"23 briefly  detained as protesting doctors, nurses baton-charged in Karachi",The young doctors and nurses have been protesting for regularisation of their jobs.,"KARACHI: Police on Monday baton-charged protesting doctors and nurses and took into custody over 23 of them, including females, to prevent them from marching on the Chief Minister House.
The young doctors and nurses have been protesting for regularisation of their jobs as they were appointed by the provincial government to deal with Covid-19 pandemic and resolution of issues being faced by Karachi Metropolitan Corporation-run hospitals.
On Monday, the doctors and paramedics began their march from the Karachi Press Club and when they reached near Arts Council traffic intersection, a heavy contingent of police stopped them from moving further by placing barricades on the main roads.
The protesters staged a sit-in there for a considerable time due to which Din Mohammed Wafai Road and Sarwar Shaeed Road were closed for vehicular traffic.
A traffic mess was witnessed on I. I. Chundrigar Road, Abullah Haroon Road, Dr Ziauddin Road, etc because of the protest as traffic was diverted to alternative routes.
Saddar SP Zahida Parveen and other officials held talks with the protesters near YMCA Ground in a bid to convince the doctors to end their protest. However, the talks did not yield any positive results and several doctors and paramedics resumed their protest and started march on the CM House upon which the police used force to stop them.
“The police resorted to baton-charge and manhandled the protesting doctors and nurses,” said Dr Umer of the Young Doctors Association-Sindh.
He said 23 doctors and healthcare workers, including YDA office-bearers Dr Faisal, Dr Roshan, Dr Husain and Dr Shahzad, were taken into custody. 
The doctors and paramedics staged a sit-in near the YMCA ground on Deen Muhammad Wafai Road and it was ended late in the night after the police released the held doctors and nurses.
Dr Faizan Memon of the YDA-Sindh said that the protesters had returned to their camp outside the press club after ending their sit-in near YMCA Ground. 
He said on Monday night that the general council of YDA-Sindh decided to observe a ‘black day’ on Tuesday (today) across the province against the arrests and police action.
He said a two-hour token boycott of all out-patient departments would be carried out and all Covid vaccination centres would remain closed. He said if their demands were not fulfilled within the next week, they would resume their march on the CM House.

4,Gen Bajwa briefed on army’s role in Rs1.1tr Karachi uplift plan,"Army chief visits police head office, meets martyrs’ families.","KARACHI: Chief of the Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa on Monday appreciated the role of armed forces supporting the civil administration for execution of the Rs1.1 trillion Karachi Transformation Plan announced by Prime Minister Imran Khan in September 2020.
During a visit to the headquarters of Corps V, the army chief also lauded the performance of law enforcement agencies for bringing down the crime rate and terrorism activities in the metropolis. 
Corps Commander Lt Gen Muhammad Saeed received the army chief who was given a briefing about different jobs of the force in the city.
“The COAS was also briefed on formation’s support to civil administration in implementation of the Karachi Transformation Plan (KTP) including FWO [Frontier Works Organisation], NLC [National Logistic Cell] and NDMA’s [National Disaster Management Authority] efforts for improvement in existing infrastructure to safeguard against urban flooding in Karachi and uplift of relevant civic facilities,” said a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).

The army chief appreciated synergised efforts of all stakeholders in implementation of the transformation plan, it added.
Last year, Prime Minister Imran Khan had announced the ambitious uplift package for the development of the country’s financial capital. Several projects relating to water supply, solid waste management, storm water drains clearance and resettlement, sewage treatment, road infrastructure and mass transit are part of the KTP and different military organisations have been working on many of these projects.
Sacrifices of police, Rangers for peace lauded

5,Bilawal rejects Sindh’s participation in health insurance scheme,Alleges centre is diverting govt hospitals’ funds to private ones,"KARACHI: Days after Prime Minister Imran Khan “requested” the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) government of Sindh for its participation in the federal health insurance scheme, the party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Monday rejected the proposal saying public hospitals of the province were serving the people much better and alleged that the centre’s policy “favoured” private hospitals. 
In a strong, blunt and convinced way, the PPP chairman was sure about the ineffectiveness of the centre’s health insurance scheme and efficiency of free treatment policy of Sindh government hospitals, saying the health card scheme could not even cover single day expenditure of expensive treatments of different life threatening diseases at the hospitals. 
“We [Sindh government] are not only offering those expensive free treatments but also ensuring lifetime care and medication to the patients,” he said while addressing a press conference at Bilawal House.  

Alleges centre is diverting govt hospitals’ funds to private ones  

“Khan Sahab (PM) puts out feelers to the people about the health insurance scheme and praises it. But it’s not a system of care. This system cannot even afford single day treatment of Covid-19 patients. It has certain limits. It can’t afford open heart surgeries (carried out in Sindh government hospitals) in a single day. I challenge Punjab. I challenge KP. I challenge Balochistan and Kashmir. Show me one hospital of the standard being maintained by NICVD [National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases] and JPMC [Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre].” 
He claimed that the people from all over Pakistan were coming to Sindh for liver and kidney transplants and insisted that the provincial government’s model for free treatment at government hospitals was not only effective but also helping capacity building of the public sector health facilities.  
Mr Bhutto-Zardari said he had reason to raise doubts over the centre’s health insurance scheme. “This move benefits private hospitals. You are diverting government funds to private hospitals,” the PPP chairman said. “It’s a kind of robbery on resources of public sector hospitals. You are taking money from government hospitals and diverting it to private hospitals. It’s not justified by any means.” 
Only last week, striking a tone of reconciliation for second consecutive time during his visit to Karachi, Prime Minister Imran Khan had called for better coordination between Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf-led federal government and the Sindh administration for Karachi’s development and “requested” again the provincial government for its participation in the health card scheme and its approval of Bundal Island development. 
The PM while mentioning benefits of the health insurance scheme had referred to its launch in Punjab where by March 2022 it would cover every family in the province while it had already been extended to every corner of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir governments were ready to launch the initiative.  
The PPP chairman’s categorical stance, however, has ruled out the possibility of the Sindh government’s participation in the scheme. 
LG law
Mr. Bhutto-Zardari reiterated that the recently-passed local government law would empower local bodies politically and financially. He said that the Sindh Local Government Act was being called a black law by those who had unilaterally imposed a local government ordinance on Punjab. 
“Property tax will directly be given to local bodies, and when they start collecting the taxes themselves, they will have finances to help the people,” he said. 
He said that the local bodies would be strong politically too as education, health and law departments of towns would be answerable to the elected bodies. They will have to submit a report every two weeks. 
“The only reason other political parties are opposing the law is that they know they will lose local body polls to the arrow [electoral symbol of the PPP]. It’s about time that all of PPP’s political opponents accept the success of the party and realise that it is stronger than ever.” 
In the coming local body elections, he said, people across the country, including Karachi, would prove that the PPP was the only party that had solution to their problems. 
“The PPP is the only party which speaks the truth and has good intentions,” Mr Bhutto-Zardari said.

Based on a book Nomadland: Surviving America in the 21st Century, it tells the tale of a woman who dwells in a van and who, after her husband’s passing, travels across the US. Although it’s a common phenomenon, the idea sounds a trifle outlandish in the digital age. 
A group show — participated by 22 artists — having the name Nomad that’s under way at the Full Circle Art Gallery doesn’t wholly subscribe to the meaning of the word. It investigates the extremely important and timeless issues of ‘identity, freedom and resistance’. 
How so? The curator Shanal Kazi’s statement gives answer to the query but by raising many other questions: “[With] the advent of social media, art can transcend everywhere. Identity — is it regressive, and how does one unleash freedom? If so, how does one represent the resistance? Is [it] the resistance to ourselves, within ourselves or collective? Is the freedom within ourselves a pact we make or is in a collective [sense]? The identity of our nation has been fraught with tumult, much of the history written or re-written to suit the writer. Much of the notion of our ‘self’ is undoubtedly fraught with a similar tumult — how do we decide what self to embrace?” 
These questions and many more represent the kind of unease that the artist community feels about contemporary life. They can be categorised as existential inquiries aimed to extract meaning out of mostly disturbing round-the-clock goings-on. The works on display in the gallery do indicate that the creative souls of our time try not to lose sight of both the aesthetics involved in creating art and the issues that lend meaning to their aesthetic sense. 
The names of those whose works are on view in the show are: Anushka  Rustomji, Faizan Reidinger, Zoila Brenna Solomon, Zaam Arif, Raheela  Abro, Erum Akhtar, Yusra Taqi Allawala, Syed Faraz Ali, Ramsha Rabbani,  Anya Akhtar, Changez Khan, Areeb Tariq, Sundeep Kumar, Laiba Abid,  Mahnoor Salman, Ahsan Memon, Mehreen Fatima, Imran Nafees, Hiba Karim,  Kiran Waseem, Anaab Z Hamid and Beygum Bano. The exhibition concludes on  Tuesday (today).

8,Seven-day anti-polio drive launched across Sindh,Sindh CM Syed Murad Ali Shah says authorities must also deal with childhood immunisation to prevent childhood diseases.,"KARACHI: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Monday said it was due to the political commitment and focused efforts of the Pakistan Peoples Party particularly in the high-risk union councils of the province that no new case of polio had emerged since July 2020. 
He was talking to reporters after inaugurating a seven-day province-wide polio campaign at Sobhraj Hospital where children would be administered oral drops.
Sindh Health Minister Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, parliamentary secretary on health Qasim Siraj Soomro, health secretary Zulfiqar Shah, Karachi Commissioner Iqbal Memon and others were present on the occasion. 
“The Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) for polio has launched a province-wide polio campaign from Dec 13 to 19 as part of the national immunisation days to give oral polio drops to over nine million children of under five years across the province,” the CM said. 

Murad says no new polio cases reported since July 2020

The drive would be conducted in all the 30 districts of the province, he said, adding that out of the targeted children, more than two million lived in Karachi. 
Mr Shah said that because of the coronavirus pandemic, anti-polio campaigns, including routine immunisation could not be carried out for a considerable period of time, therefore, an immunity gap in children had developed. 
“The gap is being addressed through back-to-back monthly polio campaigns since Aug 2020 and we have controlled the spread of the virus throughout 2021,” he said. “Thanks to these campaigns that Sindh has not reported a single new case of polio since July 2020 and environment samples are also coming in negative, which is quite encouraging,” he said. 
The CM said the communities living in the super high-risk union councils [for polio] needed more services through new initiatives. “We have installed water filtration plants, experimental dispensaries, model EPI centres, mother and child health facilities, among other initiatives in such union councils,” he said. 
He said that while dealing with the pandemic of coronavirus, the authorities must also deal with childhood immunisation to prevent childhood diseases.“Children can be saved from diseases like polio through vaccination,” he said, urging media to raise awareness among the people. 
He said the Pakistan Paediatric Association, Pakistan Medical Islamic Medical Association, medical experts across the world, as well as prominent religious scholars in Pakistan and across the region endorsed the oral polio vaccine as the safest and most effective for not only preventing polio, but also eradicating it from the environment, 
“During the polio campaign launched in September, the government has achieved more than 98 per cent coverage,” he added. 
Meanwhile, the CM met assistant superintendents of police (ASP) of Specialised Training Programme at National Police Academy, on Monday at the CM House.

9,"Appeals against acquittals should not be filed in routine, rules SHC",Court warns of action if appeals challenging acquittals of 14 MQM workers found frivolous,"KARACHI: While hearing a set of appeals filed against the acquittal of 14 workers of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, the Sindh High Court has noted that countless frivolous appeals against acquittals were being filed either by the office of the prosecutor general or on Rangers’ recommendations.
A two-judge bench headed by Justice K. K. Agha warned that the bench would take action against the person who has authorised filing of the latest appeals against the MQM workers if the same found as frivolous.
When the bench took up the appeals for hearing, it was informed that the special public prosecutor of the Rangers, who has been assigned to plead the matter, was out of the province and time was sought for his appearance.

Court warns of action if appeals challenging acquittals of 14 MQM workers found frivolous 

“It is well known that appeals against acquittal are on narrow basis and they should only be filed if there are good reasons which justify the appeals,” the bench observed in its order.
Such appeals should not be filed in a routine and mechanical manner unless there was some legal basis, it said.
“If we come to the conclusion that appeals are being filed on frivolous basis, this court might take necessary action against the person who is authorising to file such frivolous appeals which unnecessarily clog up the work of this court. Furthermore, in most of the cases compliance is not made on time and these appeals are clogging the system for years,” it added.
The bench directed its office to send the copy of this order to the prosecutor general and DA JAG, Rangers for information and compliance.
In April, an antiterrorism court had acquitted 26 MQM workers in 52 cases pertaining to possession of explosive material and illicit weapons for want of evidence. They were arrested during a pre-dawn raid by Rangers at the Nine Zero headquarters of the MQM on March 11, 2015.
After the trial court’s verdict, the appeals were filed in SHC against the acquittal of 14 workers.

“For two whole months, the students carried out extensive research, photo documentation, drawing and drafting of the original landmarks. After rigorous finishing and minute detailing, the students finally put up these miniature models for display,” explained Tania Nasir, the in charge of the visual studies department.
Each student group was first tasked with selecting a landmark and then recreating it on a scale of 1/8th, she added.

“Our goal this semester was to push the students to experiment with an array of mixed media and create real-life architectural landmarks of Karachi as miniature models. The foundation year consisted of architecture, industrial design, and graphic design students who were split into seven groups,” she said.
Co-instructors Asim Mehdi Kazmi and Muhammad Owais assisted students in considering their major options, sharing a breadth of experiences while promoting in-depth thinking and skill development.
“Each year, the course ends with a final project which incorporates skill, technique, and understanding of the material/media learned over the semester with students putting up their finished work for the public showcase,” said Mr Kazmi.
Appreciating students’ efforts, Mr Owais said students tried their best to recreate these architectural landmarks as close to real as possible using various textures and techniques such as sand, clay, metal wires, cement, plaster of Paris, play dough, woodwork, laser cutting, etc.

14,Works on revival of old courses of natural waterways on the anvil,"HYDERABAD: Works on the revival of natural waterways, Dhoro Puran and others, in Mirpu­rkhas and Badin districts...","HYDERABAD: Works on the revival of natural waterways, Dhoro Puran and others, in Mirpu­rkhas and Badin districts estimated to cost Rs2 billion will be carried out to help the waterways run along their old courses and offload into spinal drain of Left Bank Outfall Drain (LBOD) that falls into sea. 
The works to be executed by Sindh irrigation department’s deve­­l­op­ment wing would become part of an already approved sche­me worth Rs4,788.223m whose total cost would then rise to over Rs6bn, said officials. 
The LBOD dissects Dhoro Puran at four locations, RD-276, RD-261, RD-238 and RD-211 due to what irrigation experts believe its faulty design and propose underpasses for the drain. 
Sindh Minister for Irrigation Jam Khan Shoro recently visited the marked locations that fell within Mirpurkhas and Badin districts where he was briefed about issues arising out of the construction of the LBOD. He inspected different sections of the drain to understand the problem and come up with its solution. 
LBOD was built by Wapda in 90s and handed over initially to Sindh Irrigation and Drainage Authority (SIDA) and then to Sindh irrigation department.  
The minister was accompanied by Sindh Assembly members, whose constituencies were hard hit by heavy rains that led to breaches in the LBOD last year and inundated large swathes of farmland.  
The blocked sections of natural waterways including Dhoro Puran, Hakro Dhoro and old left-over drainage pockets that were to be connected with the LBOD caused accumulation of rainwater in the areas and exacerbated the conditions. 
Dhoro Puran is considered to be an old channel of the Indus river, which has functioned as a drain while receiving runoff of monsoon rains and other natural waterways.  
Irrigation officials told Dawn that Hakro Dhoro fell into Dhoro Puran near Naukot and then they fell together in spinal drain of LBOD at RD-261. Dhoro Puran’s issue had been longstanding since the construction of LBOD in 90s, they said. 
In 2011 rains, LBOD had also caused massive devastation due to blockage of old waterways including Dhoro Puran and Hakro Dhoro, which had been blocked by encroachments and human settlements at different locations.  
The Sindh government had at that time spent around Rs5bn but failed to achieve desired results.  
The old course of Dhoro Puran was intersected by spinal drain between RD-305 to RD-211. “Dhoro Puran originates from the north of Mirpurkhas city and after passing through the city it runs parallel to left bank of MMD (Mirpurkhas Main Drain). 
“The MMD’s wastewater falls in spinal drain at RD-297 that has first engineered deviation under LBOD Stage-I Project from its natural course in 90s,” said chief engineer of development region-II, Zarif Khero.  
He said that spinal drain intersected Dhoro Puran at RDs 297, 276, 251, 238 and 211. From RD-211 of teh spinal drain, the Dhoro takes its natural course towards south-east and falls at its ultimate destination into the sea. 
The irrigation minister and MPAs discussed problems faced by people in monsoon rains and flooding caused by LBOD over the years. They shared their views on possible solutions to make the system efficient and avoid rain related damage exacerbated by LBOD.  
According to Khero, it had now been decided to revive natural routes of old waterways, especially Dhoro Puran, hence the works needed to be executed urgently. 
An old scheme titled “Restorat­ion/rehabilitation of LBOD & Kotri drainage network system including activation of Dhoras” (phase-II) was executed to restore natural routes of waterways, he said.  
He said that some works were pending execution owing to issues with land acquisition and litigation. Underpasses needed to be built with escape regulator along spinal drain for which a spot had been identified between RD-238 to RD-211. “The underpasses were not originally part of the old scheme,” he said. 
He said that underpasses would be included in the Rs2bn scheme now in addition to the already approved scheme of Rs4,788.223m. A proposal was being sent to the government for inclusion of the Rs2bn works in the approved scheme, he said.

Terming him an “icon of achievement” of the province, they paid glowing tributes to Dr Baloch who was an intellectual, author, researcher and former vice chancellor of Sindh University (SU).
They were addressing a seminar titled “Dr Nabi Bukhsh Khan Baloch: As a Researcher and Expert of Latif’s Poetry” held on his 104th birth anniversary at Shaikh Ayaz Auditorium of Arts Faculty Building, SU, organised by Dr N.A Baloch Chair.
The speakers called for including his works in universities’ syllabus.
Kazi Khadim Hussain observed that Dr Baloch was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth; he achieved greatness through sheer hard work and dedication. He did not create space for himself at the cost of others, he added.
He lauded that born to a farmer on Dec 16, 1917, in the village of Jaffar Khan, Dr Baloch contributed to education, literature, folklore and history. He said the scholar also wrote books in Arabic, Persian, English and Urdu.
“He visited every nook and corner of Sindh to preserve its history and culture,” Mr Khadim said and added that Dr Baloch worked hard all his life to document everything about Sindh. His major contribution, according to him, was work on folk literature and Sindhi language dictionary.
Prof Dr Arfana Mallah said the literary and research work of Dr Baloch must be included in universities’ syllabus for teaching so that the youth might benefit from his work.
She said Dr N.A. Baloch produced work of international standards as he was a man who kept researching on a variety of subjects round the clock and throughout the year.
Sindhi Language Authority chairman Dr Noor Muhammad Jhinjhi said Dr Baloch had worked on heritage, lexicography, language and places of Sindh to come up with his research. “Dr Baloch had in fact reincarnated Sindh,” he said.
Dr Ishaque Samejo termed Dr Baloch the pioneer of teachers’ education as he was a staunch supporter of teachers’ education. Baloch had worked hard to produce a collection of Sindh’s folklore, riddles, archaeological heritage etc.

17,PPP plans to hold protests against gas loadshedding across Sindh,LARKANA: Pakistan Peoples Party Sindh president Nisar Ahmed Khuhro on Monday announced his party would hold protests...,"LARKANA: Pakistan Peoples Party Sindh president Nisar Ahmed Khuhro on Monday announced his party would hold protests against gas loadshedding across the province on Dec 17. 
Khuhro said in a press statement that PPP MNAs, MPAs, Senators, party leaders and workers would lead demonstrations in all district headquarters throughout the province.
He said that Sindh produced 70 per cent of the total gas produced by the country still rulers were depriving the province’s population of its just share in gas. The centre’s move to cut down on the province’s share was unconstitutional and it would further deepen sense of deprivation among people, he said. 
He said that Article 158 of the Constitution ensured first right on the gas of people of the area from where it was extracted. If it was still in excess after meeting requirements of that particular province, then it could be provided to other provinces, he explained.
Khuhro accused the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government of not only enhancing the gas tariff but also snatching away the province’s right on the gas. It was an ‘anti-people’ policy, he said. 
He said that it was incomprehensible that the federal government was holding Sindh responsible for all the ills although both the electricity and gas came under the centre’s domain. How a province could be held responsible for the gas crisis, he asked.
He said that by creating shortage of gas from Kashmore to Karachi, the government was deliberately pushing people towards starvation. The centre was punishing people and casting negative impact on industrial growth as well on the pretext of power and gas loadshedding and low pressure of gas, he said. 
He wondered why the PTI leadership was tight-lipped when stoves in peoples’ homes had stopped burning. The federal government’s policy was an attack on provincial autonomy, which had been deliberately adopted to do away with 18th Amendment which was a thorn in the centre’s side, he said.
He said that his party would easily thwart federal government’s move against the 18th Amendment. The province-wide protest on Dec 17 would prove to be a strong voice against federal government’s anti-people polices, he said.
