4,‘Farmers being supplied fertiliser after verification’,"The measure was taken after reports of shortage, price hike and hoarding of fertiliser.","RAHIM YAR KHAN: After the reports of the shortage, price hike and hoarding of fertiliser, the district administration has taken several measures to ensure urea availability at government notified rates, says a handout by the deputy director of the public relations on Monday.
A meeting was called by Deputy Commissioner Nouman Yousuf to address the complaints about the overcharging, hoarding and black marketing of fertilisers. Additional Deputy Commissioner Dr Sidra Saleem told the meeting that complaints were being dealt with without any exception. She said that genuine farmers were being facilitated to the maximum extent and were being supplied fertilizer as per their requirement after verification by Agriculture Department teams.
Furthermore, the sale of urea in large quantities was being discouraged, except for the genuine farmers, as there were reports of further sale of these bags by middlemen at higher rates. Certain pressure groups have been pushing the dealers and the Agriculture Department in Sadiqabad for purchase of large quantities which has been discouraged.
The handout says the same groups are spreading disinformation through the media, whereas the Agriculture Department and the district administration are working in close liaison with the Special Branch to identify any hoarding and black marketing or overcharging and immediate actions are taken on violations.
She added the closure of the Fatima Fertilizers Plant for annual maintenance contributed to the shortage of urea supply to the district.
The plant has recently resumed its operations. District and tehsil control rooms have been established to monitor the prices of fertilizer and complaints received are strictly being dealt with. She said inspection of godowns was being carried out by joint teams of the revenue and agriculture department.

A report issued by the DC on Oct 28 revealed that people had established illegal shops at Ford Wah Canal on Head Sulemanki link road at McLeod Ganj.
The report said the last anti-encroachment drive failed to retrieve the land due to the unavailability of enough police force.
Petitioner Muhammad Ramzan told Dawn that he first approached DC Shoaib Judoon in December 2020 after the assistant commissioner (AC) did not get vacated the land despite the orders of Lahore High Court, Bahawalpur Bench, issued on Nov 14, 2020.
He said the DC office started the operation on Feb 28 after it received a contempt of court notice on Jan 20. The operation, however, lasted a few hours due to unknown reasons and the officials submitted a report of the completion of the operation to the court.
He said afterwards, the administration remained quiet for months until the court served a show-cause notice to former DC Shafqatullah Mushtaq in May.
He said that on May 20, the officials after demolishing a few encroachments again left the operation incomplete and submitted a report of retrieving the state land to the high court to save their skin.
He said the administration broke their silence after receiving another court direction to vacate the state land on Sept 17. He said this time, DC retired Capt Muhammad Waseem after hearing parties regarding the matter and checking the revenue record, issued instructions to the Minchinabad AC on Oct 28 to get the land vacated within 30 days.
He said the tehsil administration neither obeyed the court orders nor followed DC’s instruction as usual.
Citizens demanded higher-ups to take strict action against the land mafia.
When contacted for version on Nov 30, newly-appointed AC Ahmad Javed Cheema said it was the responsibility of his predecessor, who was transferred a few days ago, to implement the DC order. He, however, vowed to take action against the land grabbers at his earliest convenience.

13,PR mulling Kazakhstan’s $300m offer for track rehabilitation,LAHORE: Pakistan is considering an offer of a soft loan worth $300 million from Kazakhstan for rehabilitation of the...,"LAHORE: Pakistan is considering an offer of a soft loan worth $300 million from Kazakhstan for rehabilitation of the decaying 860-kilometre up/down track from Kotri to Khanpur -- the most critical portion on the entire rail network. Kazakhstan has also offered to execute the project itself since it has the required expertise and technology.
“Kazakhstan has offered us $300 million soft loan for rehabilitation of the 860km long up/down decaying railway track (Khanpur-Kotri-Khanpur). Along with the funding, it has also asked us to execute this project,” Pakistan Railways Chairman Dr Habibur Rehman Gilani told Dawn. “Their offer is under consideration. And if it is accepted, we will give them a go-ahead.”
Kazakhstan has an advanced rail system with the capacity to manufacture locomotives, rail and other equipment and instruments. Four years ago, Russia’s top business group, Transmashholding, reportedly entered into two agreements with the General Electric to work together in Kazakhstan in various rail-related fields.
“Kazakhstan is a developed country having a modern railway transport system (subways etc). The country’s interest in rehabilitating our most critical Khanpur-Kotri section will be a great help for Pakistan Railways,” the chairman said, adding the GE-Transmashholding joint venture contributed greatly to advancing Kazakhstan’s railways.
Dr Gilani said that Kazakhstan, besides Afghanistan, Uzbekistan and Russia, was actively in touch with Pakistan for initiation of rail services envisaging access of various Central Asian states up to Karachi and Gwadar ports for exports.
The PR, under an estimated Rs30 billion project, had planned to rehabilitate 15km to 25km of critical stretches on the 860km Khanpur-Kotri-Khanpur up/down portion by replacing them with new tracks, while maintenance of the less-dangerous portions is also part of the project.
The PR had taken the decision after it felt that approval for the ML-1 project was continuously facing delays, so it should start rehabilitation of the critical portions of the track (mainly in Sukkur and Karachi divisions) on its own in funding collaboration with the federal government in a bid to avert accidents.
A majority of the 200 fatal and non-fatal accidents, including several derailments, have occurred on this portion in the last three years.

The suspects will be handed over to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Lahore Cyber Crime wing to conduct the forensic examination of the audios and videos.
On Dec 6, a woman had lodged a complaint with the Millat Town Police Station of Faisalabad, stating that she was collecting solid waste with three other women companions around 10:30am at the Bawa Chak Market, Yousaf Chowk, when she felt thirsty and went inside a shop — Usman Electric Store — owned by Saddam and asked for a bottle of water. She said the owner alleged that they had entered his shop to steal money and electronic appliances. They called other shopkeepers and helpers and beat them.
“The suspects also stripped us and dragged us in the market,” she alleged.
Five of the 10 suspects, allegedly involved in assault on the scavenger women after accusing them of theft, are already in custody. The suspects were handed over to police on physical remand to complete investigation.
Later, a CCTV footage of the shop emerged on social media, showing the women entering the shop and picking up something. A man standing in the shop tried to stop one of the women and after failing to stop her, he came out of the shop. The man tried to lock the shop but the women resisted and came out where the man grabbed two of the four women and beat them. He called other people as was seen in the CCTV footage.
The video clip showed that the women were removing their clothes and two others tried to run away but were later captured by the people. It also showed that the women were stripping themselves before the crowd and one of them was weeping in the shop while another was dragged into the shop by the men.
A police officer, on condition of anonymity, told Dawn forensic examination of the audio and video of the incident would be conducted to complete the investigation. He said the suspects would be taken to Lahore Forensic Science Agency for the examination and it would reveal whether the audios and videos were original or not.
While commenting on the arrest of the remaining suspects, he said they were conducting an investigation into the videos and would try to identify the suspects and would also arrest them soon.

17,Tenure security again ignored: IGP handpicks officer for Lahore operations DIG slot,"As a result, Ahsan Younus could stay on the post for a month against the three-year tenure security provided for by procedure.","LAHORE: The new head of the Lahore operations police was appointed ‘purely’ on the recommendation of Punjab Inspector General of Police Rao Sardar Ali Khan, replacing Ahsan Younus, who could stay on the post just for a month, against the three-year tenure security provided for in the Police Order 2001.
Dr Mohammad Abid Khan assumed his charge as 9th Lahore police operations wing deputy inspector general (DIG) during over three-year rule of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government in Punjab. He was serving as Faisalabad CPO (city police officer) and was transferred and posted in Lahore on Sunday.
An official privy to the information told Dawn that the IGP had moved a summary comprising names of some police officers to Chief Minister Usman Buzdar for the appointment of one of them as new operations DIG of Lahore. However, the IGP had given preference to BS-20 officer Dr Mohammad Abid Raja for the post among the recommended officers.
The CM, however, held the appointment process for a week or so when he was informed by his advisers that Dr Abid had not been “accommodating” the PTI leaders and workers when he was serving as Faisalabad CPO, the official said.
The advisers also told Mr Buzdar about the specific complaints of some party parliamentarians from Faisalabad against Dr Abid, he added.
He said the IGP, however, defended the officer’s appointment in Lahore, saying he was one of the “finest” officers available in DIG rank in the province, the official said.
He said other competitors for the slot included Sajid Kiani and Jehanzeb Nazir Khan.
However, he said, the chief minister picked Dr Abid for Lahore operations DIG slot on the ‘personal guarantee’ of IGP Rao Sardar Ali Khan.
Mr Kiani, who was serving as Punjab operations DIG, has been transferred and posted as Rawalpindi CPO on his own wish as his family was living close to his place of posting.
Meanwhile, Lahore continues to be one of the most vulnerable districts with regard to security of tenure for police officers given the frequent and premature transfers, since the PTI came into power.
The section 15 of the Police Order 2002 categorically provides for three-year posting period for city police officer (CPO) and the district police officer (DPO) so that the officers could have ample time to understand the local law and order issues, crime pattern etc for better policing.
The section 15 (2) of the Police Order 2002 says, “The term of office of City Police Officer or District Police Officer, as the case may be, shall be three years from the date of his posting.”Contrary to the legal provision, none of the police officers earlier appointed head of the Lahore police operations wing during the last three and a half years could complete his tenure as per the Police Order 2002.
Dr Abid replaced Ahsan Younus who remained Lahore operations DIG only for one month -- from Nov 5 to Dec 7. Mr Younus has been posted as Islamabad IGP.
The other BS-20 police officers who could not stay as Lahore operations DIG for even a year included Shahzad Akbar, Waqas Nazir, Ashfaq Ahmad Khan, Rai Babar Saeed and Sajid Kiani, the officer said. Of them, Ashfaq Ahmad Khan was twice posted as Lahore operations DIG, but each time he was transferred prematurely.

According to a news release, at a meeting on the SNC at the Quaid-i-Academy, they were told that the government would reverse the SNC and divide the schools and syllabus into two categories -- core and core-plus groups.
Rejecting their their claim, NCC director Maryam Chughtai told Dawn that all the apprehensions of the publishers had been addressed in the meeting and there were no changes in the curriculum till 2023.
She said they were fixing typo errors in the curriculum and would not update it till 2023 and to fix errors the government did not ask the publishers for another NOC.

TPA says govt promoting class-based education

She said the curriculum was not divided into any core and core plus group. “Only teacher’s recommendations were included in the curriculum as some of the classes were assigned curriculum of higher classes and also some have extra material,” she said.
She said the publishers were twisting the facts and all their grievances were addressed in the meeting conducted on Monday.The TPA said private publishers had developed books in accordance with the SNC after hectic efforts and they were not yet on the market when the NCC director announced changing the books and policy.
It states the publishers were called to discuss the issue, but they were only directed to implement the new orders without any consultation. The publishers would not surrender before Ms Chughtai and would protest against her decision.
“In the past, Ms Chughtai acted as a spokesperson for the SNC and spoke in its support on different news channels, but now she was calling the SNC a trash,” the statement reads.
The publishers alleged that the government was rolling back the SNC and divided the students into core and core-plus groups and two different curriculums were being implemented for them.
They said the government was facilitating the foreign publishers to add or remove any material from the syllabus.
TPA president Fawaz Niaz said a class-based education system was being implemented in the country.
He said the poor children would have to study in the core group, while the rich would be taught in the core plus group. “The essence of the SNC for all the children of the country has died,” he said.
He said the private publishers were supporting the SNC for ending the class based-education system, but the foreign publishers had won and the government and its officers were following their directions.
Mr Niaz said that local private publishers would face billions of rupees loss if the SNC was changed without an audit.
He said they paid millions to get no-objection certificates (NOCs) to print the SNC, but the government’s new policy to change the SNC would incur losses on them.
He said the government should have first completely implemented the SNC in all schools and later get it evaluated. “Without implementing the SNC and reviewing its material, the government and its officers were changing the SNC and also calling it a ‘trash’ on the pressure of the foreign publishers,” he said.
He said they did not know from where the government was getting feedback on the SNC and they would have to face losses because the publishers were asked to get another NOC for the core group syllabus.
Mr Khalid Pervaiz said that private publishers were facing discrimination and would have to face the loss of billions of rupees.
He said the SNC was implemented in the schools in August 2021 and they had deposited Rs1 million to get a NOC and without receiving it, the government was now changing the SNC and asking for another NOC.
He said the publishers did not accept the policy of the government and announced a countrywide protest campaign against it. “We will close markets, hold sit-ins outside national and provincial assemblies and if the government did not stop changing its policy, we would observe a hunger strike,” he said.
He demanded that the government consult stakeholders on bringing or adding anything to the SNC.

PAC Chairman Sajid Ahmed Bhatti wondered how the department would remove the objections within 10 days when it could not do the job during the last five years.
However, the department was given time until Jan 3, 2022, to file its explanation afresh.

20,Admission forms: LHC issues notice to govt on plea for transgender column,Plea seeks direction to education authorities to add column of “transperson” in the gender section in forms of all institutions.,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Monday issued a notice to the Punjab government on a civil miscellaneous application seeking a direction to the education authorities to insert column of “transperson” in the section of gender in admission forms for all educational institutions.
Muhammad Nawaz alias Ashi Jan, a member of the transgender community, filed the application in a pending main petition, seeking implementation of various provisions of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act 2018.
Advocate Shahbaz Akmal appeared before the court on behalf of the petitioner and contended that the admission forms of the colleges/universities mentioned “male” and “female” options in the gender column, but did not mention “transperson”.
He said the act amounted to discrimination against an already marginalised community.
Justice Shujaat Ali Khan issued a notice to the respondents (Punjab government) on the application for Dec 21 when the main petition would be heard.
In this case, the court had already sought reports from the provincial government about allocation of job quota for the transgender community members in all departments and to mention eligibility for the members of the community in the job advertisement.
The petitioner submitted that the government authorities had been violating the provisions of the relevant laws by not recruiting members of the transgender community in police. He said the inspector general of police also admitted that no transperson had been appointed in the region.
The petitioner asked the court to order the chief secretary and social welfare department to ensure the implementation of the Act as even after three years transpersons did not get their right of employment.
He asked the court to seek an explanation from the IGP office, as to why it did not recruit even a single transperson during the last 10 years in police.

Screening of ‘Separation of East Pakistan – The Untold Story’ held
LAHORE: The first screening of Javed Jabbar’s documentary, ‘Separation of East Pakistan — The Untold Story’ at the Cinepax Packages Mall on Monday left the audience amazed at the ways how history had been manipulated against Pakistan, purposefully creating issues between Bangladesh and Pakistan to ensure continued regional unrest.
It was attended by eminent leaders, intellectuals and celebrities.
In the documentary, experts and intellectual leaders address the false information and share little-known facts about 1971, according to a press release. The documentary claims how the plight and insecurities of the vulnerable people of the then East Pakistan were misused by the international community to promote a separatist movement when they, including Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, did not necessarily want an independent nation. It poses the question how it is even possible that those who created Pakistan would want to break it. The documentary unfolds the reality and full extent of India’s involvement in the region, which is not limited to 1971 but, actually started years before.
Most importantly, it clarifies the fake news spread by those against Pakistan of the number of people killed and raped and clears the misnomers of the supposed, non-violent movement. The documentary also outlines the misjudgments made by those in power at the time, which created conducive environment for regional powers to play politics and break up a nation.
The documentary is an important step to clarify what really happened, to move towards improving relationships between Bangladesh and Pakistan. It is a time we told the true story so that we can build stronger ties with our Muslim brothers.
Speaking on the occasion, former senator and federal information minister Javed Jabbar said that 1971 was the source of an enduring pain and melancholy. Throwing light on the documentary, he said he had found many well-written books and vast amount of literature on 1971 tragedy but could not find even a single documentary on the subject that’s why this documentary was produced. He held in high esteem the team behind the documentary, especially the producer Iram Shahid.
Mr Jabbar said the documentary would be dubbed into Urdu for making it understandable for more people. The documentary also featured interviews of eminent scholars who all had endorsed its edited version, he said and added that making of the documentary would not have been possible without the military-civil cooperation for the archival material. The documentary screenings would also be held in Islamabad and Karachi.
