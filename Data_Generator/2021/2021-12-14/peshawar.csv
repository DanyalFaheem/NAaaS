During a visit to Sidr (Ber) fields in Takht-i-Nusrati area of Karak district on Monday, Governor Shah Farman was informed that Karak, Kohat, Lakki Marwat and Dera Ismail Khan districts were suitable for production of Sidr honey.
An official statement said that the officials told the governor that Rs200 million had been approved in the current Annual Development Programme for the honey production initiative in the province and an accredited honey quality testing laboratory would also be established in the province.

Governor inaugurates Sidr plantation drive in Karak

However, honey producers rejected the claim of the agriculture department and said that the department had no contribution towards their capacity building or giving them facilities to increase the production.
“The claim by the officials of the agriculture department is restricted to briefings, while on the ground they have done nothing for this vital sector,” Asadullah Khan, a member of All Pakistan Beekeepers, Exporters and Honey Traders Association, told Dawn.
He said that officials of the agriculture department had been talking about establishing a laboratory in Peshawar and provision of other facilities to the beekeepers and honey producers, but they did nothing on the ground.
“The association’s members had met Prime Minister Imran Khan, former chief minister Pervez Khattak and other officials, but in vain,” he said, adding that now Governor Shah Farman was taking interest for increasing honey production and building capacity of the beekeepers.
Mr Khan said that Small and Medium Enterprise Development Authority (Smeda) had recently provided honey heat processing machine to keep honey unfreeze in winter or low temperature.
According to local traders, around 300 containers, each containing 20 tonnes of honey, are exported to the Gulf States mostly Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates (UAE). They said that Karak district produced the world best quality of Ber honey after Yemen and its production could be enhanced if the government grew Sidr forests in the area.
They said that despite substantial production of different variety of honey, the province was unable to capture international market because of lack of state-of-the-art packing and processing facilities, forcing traders to export honey to Gulf States in plastic cans.
Governor Shah Farman, according to the official statement, said that high potential of Sidr honey was a great blessing for the province.
He said that barren land at large scale in southern districts was very suitable for Sidr cultivation and for this purpose all resources would be provided to the local landowners for the production of honey.
The governor formally inaugurated Sidr plantation initiative by planting a sapling. He also distributed beekeeping tool kits among farmers and representatives of Bee Keepers Association.
Talking to the locals, he said that the province had huge potential for production of Sidr honey, which was considered one of the best and most favourite honey in the entire world due to its good taste and the quality to remained liquid even in minus temperature.
The governor said that government was serious to make the initiative successful because it would make it capable to generate approximately Rs10 billion annually.

Divisional wildlife officer, Kohat, Samad Wazir told this correspondent on Monday that many species of native birds were also disappearing due to change in weather as they could not bear the harsh summers amid water scarcity.
Only small flocks of migratory birds had starting arriving in the Kohat’s four wetlands daily, he said, adding 30 to 40 waterfowls were arriving daily in the major wetlands of Tanda Dam, Dhoda, Dharwazai, Ghurzandi and Darmalak and some other lakes and streams compared to their high numbers in the past.
Mr Wazir said climate change, industrialisation, emission of sulphur dioxide from oil and gas wells and cutting of forests had led to a drop in migration of birds, which only made stopovers in Kohat while on their way to Iran and Central Asian Republics.  He said geese, swans, cranes, mallard ducks, ruddy shelducks, common teal, and shoveller ducks had started arriving here from Siberia, but they were very few in numbers.
Mr Wazir said the migration period would complete in December after which the birds would start their journey back for nesting in January.
The wildlife officer said to discourage indiscriminate hunting of birds the government had raised the hunting licences’ fee from Rs2,000 to Rs3,000 per gun per day. He said the hunting period picked up during November and continued till January. He said they had to cut the hunting bag quantity from 20 to 10 so as to stop killing of migratory birds.

Condition of the Basic Health Unit in Hassanabdal has deteriorated due to absence of staff and lack of maintenance for years. — Dawn

 
PESHAWAR: The health department has warned seven private hospitals of cancellation of their contracts for free treatment of the people under Social Health Protection Initiative over violation of the agreement.
“Authorities have received various complaints against the hospitals for charging or mistreating the patients, which is against the rules under the SHPI which ensures cashless treatment of all the residents of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” sources told this scribe.
According to them, the concerned hospitals have been warned to mitigate the grievances of patients otherwise their contract agreements would be cancelled.
Currently, there are 166 public and private hospitals in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa that are providing free treatment to the patients for which they are paid by the government through State Life Insurance Corporation.

Official says cancellation of contracts of empanelled hospitals continuous process

Dr Mohammad Riaz Tanoli, the chief executive officer of SHPI Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said that there were 524 hospitals countrywide that had been empanelled for the free treatment of the people.
“We have 7.6 million registered families in the province who are entitled to seek free health services in any hospital in any city of the country. Each family is eligible to get free treatment up to Rs1 million,” he said. He added that selection of hospitals for the programme was a long process during which their infrastructure and human resources were assessed and those fulfilling the criteria were selected.
“There is a continuous check on the performance of the hospitals and a complaint cell has been established to look into the problems of the patients at the designated hospitals. Last year, we suspended the contracts of six hospitals and some of them were allowed to work when they returned the money to the patients,” said Dr Riaz.
He said that that an assessment exercise would start in February next year to ascertain about the standard of services being provided to the patients by the hospitals. “All the hospitals, which have been empanelled for the last few years since the inception of the programme, will be subjected to inspection to see if they have the desired facilities in line with the agreements,” he added.
Dr Riaz said that they awarded different contracts and gave different rates for different diseases and surgeries to hospitals on the basis of their infrastructure and human resources. He said that some of the hospitals were eligible for chronic diseases while others were meant to carry out minor surgeries and procedures and those violating the contracts would be shown the door.
He said that cancellation of contracts of the already empanelled hospitals and taking new ones on the panel was a continuous process.
“We are going to assess the facilities at 28 new hospitals for the programme because we require more hospitals after extension of the free health initiative to the entire population of the province in November last year,” he said. He added that there were standard operating procedure (SOPs) for the empanelled hospitals and those desisting from the terms of the contract would no longer remain on the panel.
Dr Riaz said that the health facilities were issued a warning to mend their ways and satisfy the patients and if they failed to do so their contract would be cancelled.
He said that during the past few years, the hospitals upgraded their services to be able to get on the panel of SHPI and earn money. The public and private sector hospitals in many districts improved their services due to which people got treatment in their native areas, he said.
“The government wants to increase number of hospitals but provision of quality treatment is pre-requisite to get empanelled,” said Dr Riaz.

The family has a strong vote bank in the PK-91 constituency and parts of PK-92 constituency.
The family remained active in the electoral politics till the death of former provincial minister Anwar Kamal Khan Marwat. After his death, his sons and younger brother, Akhtar Munir Marwat tried their luck in the electoral politics but they could not grab any provincial or National assembly seat.
Late Mr Kamal had twice won elections to the PK-91 consisting of the Lakki city and rural areas. He remained a provincial minister and a senator.
One of the factions led by Mr Kamal’s sons, Nasir Kamal and Mansoor Kamal, is supporting independent Shafqatullah Khan Khoidadkhel, also backed by Saifullah brothers and former provincial minister Dr Hisham Inamullah Khan.
The other faction is led by Mr Munir Marwat, the younger brother of late Anwar Kamal. Mr Munir, also former federal secretary, is currently a member of the Marwat Qaumi Jirga. His faction consists of former tehsil nazim Faridullah Khan Meenakhel Advocate and other elders of the family.
Mr Munir has launched the campaign to muster people’s support for Zafrullah Khan, another independent aspiring for Lakki tehsil chairman’s slot.
The elders of both the factions organised public meetings in the Lakki city and rural areas last week to show their strength.
Former federal minister Anwar Saifullah Khan also addressed a meeting in Lakki city to win over voters for Shafqatullah Khan.
On the other hand, Mr Munir said the support by his family would prove helpful for Zafrullah Khan to win elections for the seat of tehsil chairman with a big margin. He said alliance between Meenakhel and Ahmadkhel families would have a far-reaching impact on future electoral politics of the district.

A total of 24 candidates, including two women, are in the field for the three tehsil chairmen slots.
Ten candidates including former woman MPA and nominee of Qaumi Watan Party, Dr Faiza Rasheed, are running for Haripur tehsil chairman’s seat. Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl, Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan and Jamaat-i-Islami have fielded their candidates for the seat, besides six independents.
However, PTI’s Akhtar Nawaz Khan, independent Samiullah Khan and PML-N’s Sardar Haroonur Rasheed are likely to make the contest more interesting.
Akhtar Nawaz, who also served as district nazim, enjoys the support of Ayub Brothers -- federal minister Omar Ayub Khan, provincial minister Arshad Ayub Khan and his brother MPA Akbar Ayub Khan.
Known as an honest politician, Mr Nawaz belongs to the Jadoon tribe and brings with him a predominantly clan-based strong vote bank.
Though PTI’s plummeting popularity graph owing to inflation could negatively impact his vote count, the traditional clan and personality-based voting pattern coupled with support of the Ayub Brothers could come in handy for him. Ayub Brothers claim to have approved uplift projects worth billions of rupees for Haripur. For reaping benefits of their services, the Ayub Brothers are eagerly pursuing their election 2023 agenda by ensuring continuity of their development projects.
Mr Nawaz has also expressed his resolve to support the development narrative of the Ayub Brothers.
Being the youngest among all the contenders, independent Samiullah Khan is an educated scion of Utmanzai tribe of Khalabat Township. He relies on the vote bank of his paternal uncle and two-time MPA Gohar Nawaz Khan, and his first cousin, former PML-N MNA Babar Nawaz Khan, as he claims the two former lawmakers had launched many development projects in Haripur during their tenures.
Babar Nawaz is also playing the PML-N’s card in support of his cousin despite the fact that his party has nominated Sardar Haroonur Rasheed, brother of former PML-N MNA Sardar Mushtaq, as party’s candidate, ignoring his (Babar Nawaz’s) request.
Sardar Haroon is also actively pursuing his affiliation with PML-N coupled with the largest Gujjar vote bank of their tribe. But analysts believe the divided house of PML-N will likely benefit the PTI candidate.
The contest for Khanpur tehsil chairman seat is also very interesting as Raja Shahab Sikandar and Raja Haroon Sikandar, the paternal grandsons of former caretaker chief minister and federal minister, late Raja Sikandar Zaman, are pitted against each other. Both are making their debut in the politics of Haripur.
Raja Shahab, a PTI nominee, is a law graduate from London and has active support of Ayub Brothers. While his first cousin, Raja Haroon, a PML-N contestant, and son of former PTI MNA Dr Raja Amir Zaman, is also an educated young man. 
Raja Shahab takes credit for his personal social activities and development projects of his grandfather and the Ayub Brothers. While Raja Haroon impresses the voters with the projects of his grandfather and his father, Dr Raja Amir Zaman, and uncle Raja Faisal Zaman, also a former MPA.
Many believe the Ayub Brothers have played a good stroke by picking Raja Shahab as a future ally from the archrivals, Rajgans of Khanpur, and would make their best efforts for ensuring the success of young Shahab to firm up their grip over the vote bank of Khanpur, once the stronghold of Rajgans.
But the Rajgans have taken the election for tehsil chairmanship slot as their last chance for political survival, and have got united for the first time behind Raja Haroon.
Though there are 10 candidates vying for Ghazi tehsil seat, PML-N’s Syed Qassim Shah, nephew of party Senator Pir Sabir Shah, PTI’s Naveed Iqbal and independent Khayam Islam, a nominee of Jehazan Wala group of philanthropists, are in close contest.
Mr Islam is a cousin of independent MPA Faisal Zaman, who is behind bars in the murder case of PTI leader Malik Tahir Iqbal and his friend.
Naveed Iqbal is younger brother of slain leader Malik Tahir Iqbal.
