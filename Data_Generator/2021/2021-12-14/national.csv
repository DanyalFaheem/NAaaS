0,"BJP distorting history, threatening Pakistan: FO",Indian minister had hurled terrorism accusation on Islamabad,"ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office on Monday accused the Indian ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of distorting history and threatening Pakistan for gaining political advantage and said it was reckless.
“Pakistan strongly condemns the unwarranted, gratuitous and provocative comments made by the Indian defence minister at an event in New Delhi on December 12, 2021, questioning established historical facts, levelling unfounded allegations in the context of terrorism, and hurling threats against Pakistan,” Foreign Office spokesman Asim Iftikhar said in a statement.
He was responding to remarks by Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on the occasion of a 1971 war commemoration.
Singh had said that the 1971 war “tells us that the partition of India on the basis of religion was a historic mistake. Pakistan was born in the name of one religion but it could not remain one. After the defeat of 1971, our neighbouring country is constantly waging a proxy war in India”.

Indian minister had hurled terrorism accusation on Islamabad

The Indian defence minister further accused Pakistan of indulging in “terrorism and other anti-India activities” in an attempt to break India. Indian forces, he claimed, “foiled its plans in 1971 and now work is going on to eliminate roots of terrorism by our brave forces. We have won in the direct war, and will achieve victory in the proxy war as well”.
The FO spokesman, in his response, said it was “the BJP’s special forte to misrepresent history, resort to revisionism and delusional thinking, and indulge in false bravado”.
He said the timing of Singh’s latest statement showed that it was made in view of upcoming state elections in Uttar Pradesh and other states.
“The timing of the Indian defence minister’s provocative rhetoric is, therefore, not surprising, as the BJP-RSS combine is desperate to win elections in Uttar Pradesh and other states, typically inciting hyper nationalism and seeking to advance the extremist Hindutva agenda,” he said.
“The Indian defence minister’s chest-thumping and war-mongering are nothing but further evidence of India’s irresponsible behavior and its relentless belligerence towards Pakistan,” he added.
Rejecting Indian allegation of terrorism, Mr Iftikhar said the world was aware of the fact that the Hindutva-inspired regime in India was carrying out sate-terrorism against Kashmiris in Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK).
He said that Pakistan had last year presented “a comprehensive dossier” with “irrefutable evidence” of the Indian government’s planning, aiding, abetting, financing and executing terrorist activities in Pakistan.
Pakistan, the FO spokesman said, was fully capable of thwarting India’s aggressive designs.
“We have demonstrated our resolve and capability in this regard, including in the recent past,” he said in reference to the 2019 military standoff between the two neighbouring arch rivals.
“The BJP leaders will be well-advised to desist from any ill-conceived misadventure and also stop dragging Pakistan in India’s domestic politics for electoral gains,” he underscored.

ISLAMABAD: Japan has announced $4.35 million grant to procure essential oral polio vaccines as part of its continued support to Pakistan for eradication of the crippling disease.
The latest grant will be utilised for procurement of 24 million oral doses of vaccines. It will allow the programme to reach around 21 million children under five years of age with focus on the high-risk districts with persistent poliovirus transmission. The vaccines will be used during vaccination drives.
The notes of the grant were signed and exchanged between Japan and Unicef and the grant agreement was signed and exchanged between Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and Unicef.
“The polio eradication efforts made substantive progress this year, limiting the virus circulation which resulted in a significant decrease in polio cases despite challenges posed by Covid-19. The programme is confident to permanently interrupt all types of poliovirus by the end of 2023,” said Dr Shahzad Baig, the national coordinator for Pakistan Polio Eradication Programme.
Appreciating the support from the government of Japan, Dr Shahzad Baig said: “We are grateful to the people and the government of Japan for their unwavering support for the children of Pakistan. The new funding will enable us to reach every child with the essential polio vaccine.”
Ambassador of Japan WADA Mitsuhiro appreciated the progress made this year in controlling the spread of poliovirus, saying that “we are now only one step away from the goal, a polio-free Pakistan”.
He reiterated his support to the initiative of eradicating all types of poliovirus by the end of 2023 and noted that “Japan has provided assistance in maternal and child health, polio eradication, and routine immunisation in Pakistan for decades and it will continue its support that will directly benefit vulnerable people”.
“We are glad to witness collaborative effort between polio programme and expanded programme on immunisation, represented by recently conducted measles rubella and polio campaign. We are also honoured that numerous polio programme experiences are utilised to fight against Covid-19 such as 1166 helpline, PCR test capacity at polio laboratory and vaccinators’ trainings under JICA project. We have a strong desire to witness all types of poliovirus interruption by the end of 2023 as suggested by the government of Pakistan.
“We appreciate the unwavering leadership of the government of Pakistan, with the highest respect to the frontline health workers,” said Shigeki Furuta, the chief representative of JICA.
“Pakistan has achieved tremendous success against interrupting poliovirus this year. From 84 reported polio cases in year 2020, the incidence has come down to one case over the last 11 months,” said Aida Girma, the Unicef representative in Pakistan, highlighting consistent efforts of the government of Pakistan and partners.
“The last mile towards eradication, however, will be tough and requires continuous support from partners like the government of Japan to achieve a polio-free status,” said Girma while acknowledging the Japanese support.
The new funding is part of the continuous support by the Japanese government in the polio eradication programme since 1996. To date, the grant and loan contribution from Japan has amounted to $230.497 million to support the polio programme in Pakistan through Unicef.

2,IHC questions publication of ‘privileged document’ in Shamim’s case,Defers framing of charges against former GB judge till Dec 20,"ISLAMABAD: Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Athar Minallah, while hearing a contempt of court case against former chief justice of Gilgit-Baltistan Rana Shamim and three others on Monday, asked the amicus curiae to respond to the question whether a ‘privileged document’ could be published as a news item.
However, the court deferred the framing of charges till Dec 20 and again directed Mr Shamim to submit the original affidavit.
The court had previously directed him to submit the same during hearings on Nov 30 and Dec 7.
The contempt of court case against Rana Shamim, Jang Group’s editor-in-chief Mir Shakeelur Rehman, resident editor Aamir Ghouri and editor investigation Ansar Abbasi relates to the publication of an affidavit attributed to Mr Shamim in which he accused former chief justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar of manipulating judicial proceedings to deny bails to the top PML-N leadership prior to the 2018 general elections.

Defers framing of charges against former GB judge till Dec 20

During the proceeding, Justice Minallah pointed out that Mr Shamim had in a written reply to the show-cause notice contended that his affidavit was a privileged document and was not meant for publication. He wondered how a media house could publish a story based on a privileged document.
When Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists secretary general Nasir Zaidi, who is an amicus curiae (friend of the court) in the case, tried to divert the court’s attention to the overall political scenario, Justice Minallah said that he would not listen to any “political speeches” and remarked that he was only responsible for the Islamabad High Court.
The IHC chief justice said publishing such a news item gave an impression that the judges passed judgements on the directive of a former CJP, which was incorrect. Such a news item attempted to erode the confidence of the public and litigants in the IHC, he added.
The court asked Mr Zaidi to suggest any international journalist body and the court would appoint it as an amicus curiae to solicit a response on the issue of publishing a privileged document.
During the proceedings, Justice Minallah conveyed to Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Khalid Jawed Khan that Rana Shamim informed the court through an application that his grandson had despatched the original copy of the affidavit through a courier service on Dec 9.
On Dec 7, the IHC had directed Mr Shamim to produce the original affidavit and warned of framing charges in case of failure.
The AGP informed the court that the reply of Mr Shamim to the show-cause notice was self-explanatory in which the former GB chief justice admitted to executing the ‘contemptuous’ affidavit.
He, however, suggested that since Mr Shamim had termed the affidavit a privileged document and contradicted the reply submitted by Ansar Abbasi, the journalist and the media house might be asked to submit a counter-reply.
The court then adjourned the hearing till Dec 20.

4,Govt asks ECP to set timeline for implementation of law on EVMs,PM’s adviser says the cabinet will approve today a bill to curb the sale-purchase of votes in Senate polls.,"ISLAMABAD: The government on Monday asked the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to set a timeline for implementation of the latest legislation on the use of electronic voting machines (EVMs) in the next general elections and voting rights to overseas Pakistanis.
“The government wants the Election Commission to set a timeline for implementation of new legislation regarding EVMs and voting rights to overseas Pakistanis,” said Adviser to the Prime Minister on Parliamentary Affairs Dr Babar Awan in a media talk.
He said President Dr Arif Alvi would summon fresh sessions of the Senate and National Assembly on December 20 and 22, respectively, so that the pending legislation could be made.
“We hope that the Election Commission will show seriousness and set timelines for implementation of electoral reforms-related legislation,” he said, adding that EVMs would be purchased by the ECP, and not by the government, so the commission should tell what specification it required in the voting machines.

PM’s adviser says cabinet will approve today a bill to curb sale-purchase of votes in Senate polls

Babar Awan said the ECP should also give a timeline to overseas Pakistanis to get themselves registered as voters so that they could take part in the next general elections in the country.
On November 17, the government managed to bulldoze amendments to the Elections Act 2017 in a joint session of parliament, thereby allowing the use of EVMs and granting voting rights to overseas Pakistanis.
However, before that legislation the ECP had expressed dissatisfaction over the use of EVMs in the next polls. Later, the ECP formed three separate committees to ascertain how the commission could use EVMs in the 2023 general elections by addressing its own concerns.
On the other hand, the opposition is bent upon its stance to block the use of EVMs in the next polls.
Babar Awan said the government planned to further make some important legislation in the current parliamentary year. “The NA will remain proactive for future legislation in the current parliamentary year,” he added.
The PM’s adviser revealed that the federal cabinet in its meeting on Tuesday (today) would approve a government bill aimed at curbing sale and purchase of votes in the Senate elections. He said Prime Minister Imran Khan would be briefed on the legislation during the cabinet meeting, adding that the Parliamentary Affairs Division in collaboration with the ECP was also in the process of making such a legislation.
It has been observed that selling and purchasing of votes has become a common phenomenon in all Senate elections and Prime Minister Imran Khan has vowed to eliminate this culture in his many speeches.
Responding to a question, Babar Awan said the president had already sought opinion from the Supreme Court regarding rechecking of “doubtful” votes in the Senate polls and the apex court had ruled that such votes could be rechecked. “The Supreme Court ordered that a curtain on the [doubtful] votes can be removed,” he added.
The PM’s adviser said the opposition had rolled back its long march plan against the government because of lack of unity and harmony in its ranks. He said the leaders of opposition parties were not on the same page and thus had no agenda of long march, but to save their corruption money. “They [opposition leaders] had failed in the past and they will have the same fate in future as well,” he added.
