0,Two arrested after fatal ship collision in Sweden,"One of those arrested was a British citizen born in 1991 and the other a Croatian citizen born in 1965, authorities say.","STOCKHOLM: Sweden on Monday arrested two people after a fatal early morning collision between a Danish and British ship off the southern Swedish coast. Sweden’s prosecution service said in a statement that an investigation into  “aggravated drunkenness at sea,”  “gross negligence in sea traffic,” and  “gross causing of death by negligence” had been opened.
One of those arrested was a British citizen born in 1991 and the other a Croatian citizen born in 1965, the Prosecution Service said.
Nine boats and a rescue helicopter scoured for two missing crewmembers for hours following the early morning collision in the waters between the Swedish city of Ystad and the Danish island of Bornholm, the media spokesman at the Swedish Maritime Administration said.
“One of the ships has capsized and is upside down,” Carl-Johan Linde said.
Around 10:30 am the maritime authority cancelled the search at sea as the overturned Danish ship was towed closer to shore to enable divers to search inside.
Shortly after 3 pm, authorities decided to cancel the rescue operation, after divers had found a body in the wreck.
“The person is deceased, but the next of kin have not yet been informed yet,” police spokeswoman Evelina Olsson said.
Mats Kellerman, captain of one of the rescue boats, had already told reporters that  “the chance of finding survivors is small,” noting the time that had passed and the cold water.
“The Scot Carrier released a smaller boat and looked for people and they heard screams from the water, but couldn’t find anyone,” Jonas Franzen, communications director at the Swedish Maritime Administration, said.
Emma Valhem, spokeswoman for the Swedish Sea Rescue Society, said she did not want to speculate on the chances of finding the sailors alive.
She said with water temperatures around four degrees Celsius (39.2 Fahrenheit) at this time of year, the  “situation is critical, right from the start.” Soren Hoj, manager for the Danish shipping company operating the vessel, said there were two people in the crew and they were believed to be the ones missing.
Operations to prevent oil or other hazardous materials from being released into the water were also under way.
“There is currently no ongoing oil spill,” Sweden’s coastguard said in a statement.
The waters around Sweden’s southern coast see heavy traffic, as all ships going into the Baltic Sea from the Atlantic need to pass through the strait between Sweden and Denmark.

1,Man held in India over plot to fake own death,NEW DELHI: An Indian man was arrested after he tried to fake his death by murdering a builder and passing the body...,"NEW DELHI: An Indian man was arrested after he tried to fake his death by murdering a builder and passing the body off as his own, police said on Monday.
He did it to avoid being tried for another alleged murder, they added — Sudesh Kumar was charged with but not convicted of the 2018 killing of his daughter who had eloped.
Kumar was released last year as authorities tried to prevent coronavirus outbreaks by decongesting overcrowded prisons.
Police last month found a body in Ghaziabad, on the outskirts of the capital New Delhi, wearing Kumar’s clothes and carrying his ID card.
“The body was partially burnt and its face was beyond recognition,” police superintendent Iraj Raja said.
“We traced it back to (Kumar’s) home and got his wife to identify the body. She promptly identified it as her husband’s body. However, we were not convinced.” Police got a tip-off that Kumar was still alive and caught him outside his home on Friday.
“Upon being interrogated, he spilled the beans,” Raja said.
Kumar had befriended a mason and invited him to his house on the pretext of doing some repair work, giving him a set of clothes to wear and plying him with alcohol before beating him to death.
Raja said both Kumar and his wife have been charged with murder.

2,Moscow vetoes resolution at UN casting climate change as threat to world peace,"Some 113 of the UN’s 193 member countries supported the proposal, including 12 of the council’s 15 members.","NEW YORK: Russia on Monday vetoed a first-of-its-kind UN Security Council resolution casting climate change as a threat to international peace and security, sinking a years-long effort to make global warming more central to decision-making in the UN’s most powerful body.
Spearheaded by Ireland and Niger, the proposal called for incorporating information on the security implications of climate change” so the council could pay due regard to any root causes of conflict or risk multipliers.
The measure also asked the UN secretary general to make climate-related security risks a central component of conflict prevention strategies and to report on how to address those risks in specific hotspots.
Prior council resolutions have mentioned destabilising effects of climate change in specific places, such as various African countries and Iraq. But Monday’s resolution would have been the first devoted to climate-related security danger as an issue of its own.
Some 113 of the UN’s 193 member countries supported the proposal, including 12 of the council’s 15 members. But India and veto-wielding Russia voted no, while China abstained.
Russia and India’s envoys said that the issue should remain with such UN groups as the Framework Convention on Climate Change. Adding climate change to the Security Council’s agenda would only deepen global divisions that were pointed up by last month’s climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland, the opponents said.
Positioning climate change as a threat to international security diverts the attention of the council from genuine, deep-rooted reasons of conflict in the countries on the council’s agenda, Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said, adding that the resolution would turn a scientific and economic issue into a politicised question and give the council a pretext to intervene in virtually any country on the planet.
The measure’s supporters said it represented a modest and reasonable step to take on an issue of existential importance.
Today was an opportunity for the council to recognise, for the first time, the reality of the world that we are living in and that climate change is increasing insecurity and instability, Irish Ambassador Geraldine Byrne Nason said. Instead, we have missed the opportunity of action, and we look away from the realities of the world that we are living in.
Niger’s Ambassador Abdou Abarry added: The force of the veto can block the approval of a text, but it cannot hide our reality.

3,French forces preparing to pull out from Mali,"GAO: After nine years deployed in Mali, France is organising a drawdown, with troops preparing to leave the last of...","GAO: After nine years deployed in Mali, France is organising a drawdown, with troops preparing to leave the last of three bases in the far north of the insurgency-hit and poverty-wracked country.
French troops were sent to Mali in 2013 by then-president Francois Hollande to tackle the rebels affiliated to Al Qaeda or the militant Islamic State group in the arid north.
Paris has since deployed around 5,100 troops across the Sahel region, which includes Mali, helping to support local governments and their poorly-equipped forces fight an ever-growing Islamist insurgency that has left thousands dead.
But after leaving the Kidal and Tessal bases in north Mali, French troops are now packing up in Timbuktu.
“We’re training Malian forces in holding their ground and in guiding air support before they take over from us,” a commander in charge of the withdrawal in Timbuktu said giving only his rank, captain, and first name, Florian.
Around him, several dozen soldiers could be seen packing boxes, taking down a basketball hoop, or sorting through medical supplies and tents. All the material is being sent south by road to the French base in Gao.
“Everything is being sorted, labelled, then either destroyed, re-used here or sent back to France,” Major Christelle explained, surrounded by piles of camp beds as well as spare parts for vehicles.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced a major drawdown of French troops in June and is hoping other EU forces will step up to support what he sees as an essential counter-terror mission keeping Europe safe.
“We were around 5,000 soldiers in the Sahel in summer 2021. We will be around 3,000 in summer 2022,” said General Laurent Michon, who commands the French military mission in the Sahel known as Barkhane. New reductions are expected by 2023.
The focus of French operations will now be a particularly volatile and strategic zone known as the  “three borders” where the frontiers of Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso meet.
And French forces will no longer patrol to secure ground areas, instead focusing on providing air support to local soldiers and carrying out targeted anti-terror raids.
In September, Macron announced that French troops had killed the head of IS in the Greater Sahara (ISGS), while the head of Al Qaeda in the IS Maghreb (AQIM) was reportedly killed last year.
Macron declared the  “profound transformation” of France’s military presence in the Sahel in June amid questions over both the financial cost of the nearly decade-long mission and its rising human toll.
The anti-insurgency effort has claimed the lives of 52 French soldiers in combat.
But Paris also faces increasing difficulties on the ground including with local people who resent the presence of soldiers from the former colonial power, as well as new regimes in partner countries.
Protests that were once isolated to urban centres have spread to rural areas, fanned by social media and anger at the ever-worsening violence, as well as highly-publicised incidents of troops mistakenly killing civilians.
In November, protesters in Burkina Faso and Niger hampered a large French military supply convoy travelling from Ivory Coast to Mali. Some threw stones and held signs saying  “Down with France”.
Relations are also tense with some partner governments in the region, particularly with the new leaders of Mali after two military coups since August 2020.
Interim prime minister Choguel Kokalla Maiga accused France of a  “sort of abandonment” at the UN general assembly in September, leading Macron to brand the comments  “a disgrace” and say French troops would not compensate for the  “non-work” of the Malian state.

4,Time names Elon Musk as  ‘Person of the Year’,WASHINGTON: Time magazine on Monday named Tesla founder and space entrepreneur Elon ...,"


 
WASHINGTON: Time magazine on Monday named Tesla founder and space entrepreneur Elon Musk as its person of the year, capping a roller-coaster 2021 for the technology magnate.
The brash South African-born 50-year-old with grand ambition overtook space race rival and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to become the world’s richest person this year.
In October his electric car company’s valuation soared above a trillion dollars, and throughout the year his company SpaceX has teamed up with US space agency Nasa to launch various missions including smashing a rocket into an asteroid in a test run for redirecting any future Earth-bound space rock.
“Person of the Year is a marker of influence, and few individuals have had more influence than @elonmusk on life on Earth, and potentially life off Earth too,” tweeted Time editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal in announcing the winner.
Musk has appeared ever-present in American culture in recent years. He has amassed 66 million Twitter followers and guest-hosted the famed late-night comedy show Saturday Night Live in May.
He speaks ambitiously about his interest in colonising Mars, and plans orbital flights next year as part of SpaceX’s planned American return to the Moon.
And he is known to move markets and the value of cryptocurrencies with a single tweet.
But his main socio-economic influence for now is with his groundbreaking electric vehicles.
“Our intent with Tesla was always that we would serve as an example to the car industry, and hope that they also make electric cars so that we can accelerate the transition to sustainable energy,” Musk told Time in an interview released with the Person of the Year announcement. But outer space is at the forefront of Musk’s ambitions as well.
“His goal is to make humanity a multi-planet species,” Time contributor and author Jeffrey Kluger said in the video. Time first presented its Person of the Year award in 1927.

5,Russian teenager ‘blows himself up’ at Orthodox school,SERPUKHOV: A Russian teenager tried to blow himself up at an Orthodox school in a 14th century convent outside ...,"SERPUKHOV: A Russian teenager tried to blow himself up at an Orthodox school in a 14th century convent outside Moscow on Monday, wounding ten children.
The attacker, an 18-year-old former student of the school, survived. He was taken into intensive care and had his leg amputated after suffering injuries, authorities said.
“The person who tried to commit suicide is in intensive care,” a representative of the Investigative Commi­ttee, Olga Vradiy, told journalists.
Police and ambulances lined the red-coloured medieval walls of the convent, founded in 1360.
Russia has seen a rise in attacks on schools in recent years but incidents at religious premises are rare. The interior ministry said the teenager entered  “the Orthodox gymnasium next to the Vvedenskiy Vladychniy convent and blew himself up.” The convent is in the city of Serpukhov, 100 kilometres south of Moscow.
Ten children were wounded, said Ksenia Mishonova, the children’s rights ombudswoman for the Moscow region.
“One teenager was hospitalised. The rest of the children are in hospitals in the Moscow region,” she said on Telegram. “There is no threat to their lives”.
The Investigative Committee, which probes major crimes, said it opened a criminal case into attempted murder and the illegal handling of explosives.State news agency TASS, citing a police source, said that the teenager wanted the device to go off during morning prayers, but it detonated at the entrance to the school.
Authorities said they were working to establish the motives behind the attack.
The Interfax news agency said the teenager could have wanted to take revenge for being bullied by nuns in the convent.
Vladimir Legoida, a Russian Orthodox Church spokesman, said the church will provide assistance to  “all those affected.”  “Wherever such attacks take place, they cause the same grief and desire to prevent this from happening in the future,” he said in a statement on messaging app Telegram.

6,Israel frees Islamic leader jailed for incitement,"Salah was greeted with fireworks and a crowd of some 1,000 supporters who were chanting  “Raed as he arrives in his home city.","UMM FAHM: Israeli authorities on Monday released from jail Islamic cleric Raed Salah, a rival of the first Arab party leader to support an Israeli government, who was imprisoned for incitement to terrorism.
Salah was greeted with fireworks and a crowd of some 1,000 supporters who were chanting  “Raed, the sheikh of Al-Aqsa” as he arrived in his home city of Umm el-Fahm, in northern Israel.
Last year, an Israeli court convicted him of  “incitement to terror” for  “praising, sympathising or encouraging terrorism” in remarks made after attackers from his home city killed two policemen in Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa Mosque compound three years earlier.
Salah, who walked free after serving a 16-month sentence, heads a group known as the northern branch of the Islamic Movement in Israel.
Also read: Israel sentences Islamic leader to jail for incitement
The political wing of the movement’s southern branch, called Raam, is headed by Mansour Abbas, who in June agreed to support a government headed by right-wing Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, backing that enabled Bennett to form a government.
The Islamic movement in Israel split in 1996.
Salah’s group was outlawed in 2015 for incitement linked to the Jerusalem holy site.
His supporters say his sermons are within the bounds of free speech and that his arrests constitute political intimidation intended to silence dissent.
Salah served a nine-month sentence on similar charges in 2017. Salah’s movement calls for the boycott of Israeli elections by Palestinian citizens of Israel on the grounds that they give legitimacy to the institutions of the Jewish state.
Before Israel’s March election, Abbas said his party was willing to work with any Israeli government that would take steps to improve the lives of Arab citizens, who have long complained of unequal treatment compared to Jewish Israelis.
Abbas then emerged as a surprise kingmaker and joined the coalition in a historic deal that included a multi-billion dollar pledge to tackle some of the problems experienced by Palestinian citizens of Israel, who constitute more than 20 percent of the country’s population.

7,Britain records world’s first known death from Omicron,"LONDON: At least one person has died in the United Kingdom after contracting the Omicron coronavirus variant, Prime...","LONDON: At least one person has died in the United Kingdom after contracting the Omicron coronavirus variant, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday, the first publicly confirmed death globally from the swiftly spreading strain.
Since the first Omicron cases were detected on Nov 27 in the United Kingdom, Johnson has imposed tougher restrictions and on Sunday cautioned that the variant could overcome the immune defences of those inoculated with two shots of vaccines.
Britain gave no details on the death or whether the patient had been been vaccinated or had underlying health issues. Deaths from Omicron may have occurred in other countries but none has been publicly confirmed yet outside Britain.
“Sadly at least one patient has now been confirmed to have died with Omicron,” Johnson told reporters at a vaccination centre in London.
The variant now accounted for around 40pc of infections in the capital, he said.
“So I think the idea that this is somehow a milder version of the virus — I think that’s something we need to set on one side - and just recognise the sheer pace at which it accelerates through the population.”  Before the death was announced, Britain said 10 people had been hospitalised with the Omicron variant in various parts of England. Their ages ranged from 18 to 85 years and most had received two vaccination doses.
The UK Health Security Agency said Omicron — first detected in South Africa, Botswana and Hong Kong in late November — can overcome the immunity of those who have had two shots of vaccines such as AstraZeneca or Pfizer-BioNTech .
South Africa’s health ministry said it was unable to say with certainty if any of its Covid-19 deaths were caused by Omicron as deaths were not broken down by variant.
Johnson, who is grappling with a rebellion in his party over measures to curb Omicron and an outcry over parties at his Downing Street office during last year’s lockdowns, said people should rush to get booster vaccines to protect  “our freedoms and our way of life”.
After Covid-19 was first detected in China in late 2019, he faced criticism for initially resisting lockdown.
He has also been criticised for overseeing mistakes in transferring patients into care homes, and for building a costly test-and-trace system that failed to stop a deadly second wave.

The previously reigning Miss Universe, Andrea Meza of Mexico, crowned her successor, a Bollywood actress, in the Israeli Red Sea resort town of Eilat. The pageant was held in the middle of the night, wrapping up at 5am local time to accommodate the primetime schedule in the US.
Sandhu said she was feeling overwhelmed because it’s been 21 years since India got Miss Universe crown.
The pageant included traditional displays of national costumes, swimwear and a series of interview questions to test contestants’ public speaking skills. The top 10 showed off intricately bedazzled full-length gowns in either gold, silver or bronze. 
The Philippines’ Beatrice Luigi Gomez wore an asymmetrical cut dress with one sleeve, highlighting a new tattoo she said celebrates her womanhood.
The contest suffered a last-minute hiccup with the arrival of the omicron variant, which forced Israel to close its borders to foreign tourists late last month.
Most of the Miss Universe contestants were already in the country before the new regulations came into effect. But those who came afterward were given special permission to enter, albeit with a mandatory 72-hour quarantine period.
Throughout the run-up to the contest, all contestants were tested for the coronavirus every 48 hours and required to obey strict mask requirements.
Amid all the safeguards, Clemence Botino of France tested positive for Covid-19 shortly after arriving in Israel. After 10 days in quarantine, she was declared  virus-free last week and allowed to rejoin the competition. Last year’s pageant was delayed due to the pandemic.

9,Two Indian cops killed in Srinagar ambush,SRINAGAR: Two Indian police officers were killed and 12 others wounded in occupied Kashmir on Monday when their bus...,"SRINAGAR: Two Indian police officers were killed and 12 others wounded in occupied Kashmir on Monday when their bus was ambushed by militants, officials said — just hours after the occupation forces killed two militants in a shootout.
Shortly after darkness fell, militants sprayed the bus — which was transporting an unknown number of personnel from the police headquarters in a high-security area of  Srinagar — with automatic weapons fire. 
The area was sealed off as reinforcements searched for the assailants.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his condolences and “has sought details” of the attack, his office said on Twitter.
Hours before the attack, police killed two militants  during a brief “chance encounter” at a checkpoint near Srinagar’s military airport.
Witnesses said the `encounter’ ended within minutes and accused the police of killing the two without justification, saying they never fired at the officers.
Police fired tear gas shells as angry residents, including women, took to the street near the site of the incident, throwing stones at them amid chants of “We want freedom”. 
Last week, militants had shot dead two police officers in the northern Bandipore area of the Kashmir valley.
Anger has simmered in India-occupied Kashmir since August 2019 after New Delhi cancelled its partial autonomy and brought it under direct rule.
Officials say that since then, around 370 militants, 96 civilians and 83 Indian security personnel have died.

10,Call from Pakistan preceded Ghani’s flight from Kabul: magazine,"Hamdullah Mohib received a call from Khalil Haqqani, a leader of the Taliban faction, who asked the Afghan NSA to ""surrender""","WASHINGTON: A text message and a call from a Pakistani number persuaded Afghan National Security Adviser Hamdullah Mohib to leave Afghanistan with former president Ashraf Ghani and his family, says a report in The New Yorker magazine on Monday.
The message came around one O’clock on Aug 15, the day Taliban fighters seized Kabul. Khalil Haqqani, a leader of the Taliban faction named for his family, wished to speak with Mohib. He took the call from Haqqani who asked him to “surrender.”
Haqqani said they could meet after Mohib issued an appropriate statement. When Mohib proposed that they negotiate first, Haqqani repeated himself and hung up. “Mohib called Tom West, a deputy to (Ambassador Zalmay) Khalilzad in Doha, to inform him of the call West told him not to go to any meeting because it might be a trap,” the report added.

Earlier that day, Mohib joined President Ghani and a diplomat from the UAE on a lawn beside the President’s office to discuss a possible evacuation plan.
As they discussed the plan, they heard gunshots coming from somewhere outside the palace grounds and Ghani’s bodyguards hustled him inside.
At noon, Mohib joined Ghani in his library and agreed that Rula, Ghani’s wife, and nonessential staff should leave for the UAE as soon as possible.
Mohib’s UAE contacts offered seats on an Emirates Airlines flight scheduled to depart Kabul at four that afternoon.
President Ghani asked Mohib to escort Rula to Dubai, then join the negotiating team in Doha, to finalise talks with Khalilzad and Mullah Baradar, the Taliban leader in Doha, about the handover of Kabul.
Mohib returned to Ghani’s residence at around two, escorted Rula to a helipad behind the Dilkusha palace. They were to fly to Hamid Karzai International Airport, to make the Emirates flight.
Also read: Ghani pledged to fight till death but fled, says Blinken
By then, three of the President’s Mi-17s were at the Arg Palace and the fourth was at the airport. Mohib learned that the pilots had fully fuelled the helicopters because they wanted to fly directly to Tajikistan or Uzbekistan, as soon as possible. Other Afghan military pilots seeking refuge had already used this route to escape.
According to the New Yorker report, pilots refused to go to the airport with Rula as they had heard that rogue Afghan soldiers were seizing or grounding helicopters there.
While they were still discussing these options, Qahar Kochai, the head of the Presidential guard, approached Mohib and said: “If you leave, you will be endangering the President’s life.”
Mohib asked Kochai if he wanted him to stay. “No, I want you to take the President with you,” Kochai replied.
“Mohib doubted that all of Ghani’s bodyguards would remain loyal if the Taliban entered the palace grounds, and Kochai indicated that he did not have the means to protect the President,” the magazine reported.
“Mohib helped Rula onto the President’s helicopter and asked her to wait. With Kochai, he drove back to the residence,” found Ghani standing inside and said: “Mr. President, it’s time. We must go.”
Ghani wanted to go upstairs to collect some belongings, but Mohib “worried that every minute they delayed they risked touching off a panic and a revolt by armed guards. Ghani climbed into a car, without so much as his passport,” the report added.
As the staff and bodyguards saw the president leaving, they scuffled and shouted over who would fly. The pilots said that each helicopter could carry only six passengers.
Along with Ghani, Rula, and Mohib, nine other officials squeezed aboard, as did members of Ghani’s security detail and they flew to Uzbekistan.
In Doha that morning, Ambassador Khalilzad was discussing a surrender plan with Mullah Baradar at the Ritz-Carlton. Mullah Baradar “agreed that they will not enter Kabul” and would withdraw what Baradar described as “some hundreds” of Taliban who had already entered the capital.
Ambassador Khalilzad was in WhatsApp contact with Abdul Salam Rahimi, an aide to President Ghani, and informed Rahimi of this plan. Rahimi told Ghani that the Taliban had pledged not to enter Kabul. 
“Yet this was based on assurances from Khalilzad and the Taliban, and Ghani regarded both as unreliable sources,” the report noted.
As Ghani flew to Uzbekistan, Rahimi and dozens of other Arg palace staffers — who had no idea where Ghani or Mohib had gone — were left behind, while still negotiating a deal with the Taliban.

General Bipin Rawat, who was killed along with his wife and 11 others in last week’s accident, was seen as close to Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 
But he also courted controversy, in one instance presenting an award to an officer who tied a civilian in occupied Kashmir to the front of his military vehicle in a show of force. One man was arrested within hours of the chopper crash for posting to Instagram that Rawat had “burnt alive even before entering Jahannum”, the Muslim word for hell. 
He was arrested along with two others in Rajasthan state for “hurting public sentiment”, police said. 
Five other arrests across India were reported by local media outlets on the weekend. A bank staffer in India-held Jammu was suspended from work after accusations she had reacted to a Facebook news post of Rawat’s death with an emoji of a laughing face.
