0,PM likens inequality to security threat,Maintains pro- and anti-US lobbies in Pakistan did great injustice to country,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan has said national security is all about human security, directly associated with inclusive growth, and not just a military subject.
No country could be secure where a small segment kept getting rich and those at the bottom were left behind and the same applied to certain localities and cities that continued to develop while other areas were left behind, said Prime Minister Khan while opening The Margalla Dialogue-2021: Breaking Past, Entering Future on Monday.
Addressing the event, organised by the Islamabad Policy Research Institute (IPRI) in collaboration with National Security Division, PM Khan said inequality and disparity in development became the basis for a discord in society. “It is a very important issue of national security that how can we have equitable [and] inclusive development,” he pointed out.
Mr Khan called for strengthening national security through an indigenous course of action by exploring the tangibles of society, but regretted that society was unable to build a narrative of its own due to lack of interest in research and reliance on second-hand research from abroad.

Maintains pro- and anti-US lobbies in Pakistan did great injustice to country

Referring to the national security, the prime minister said in the changing environs, national security is “all about human security, and it is not merely a military subject. It is directly related to inclusive growth, as disparity in development leads to a sense of neglect.”
Mr Khan highlighted the need for focus on human development, lamenting that three parallel systems of education were running in the country: English-medium schools, Urdu-medium schools and religious seminaries. “Do we think there will be no fallout of this?” the PM asked.
He said English-medium schools were subject to further segmentation, while Urdu-medium schools had seen a decline in quality and there was a lack of job opportunities for students of religious schools. He attributed this imbalance to lack of research in the country and reliance on second-hand research from abroad. “This is why it is important to have an all-encompassing national security dialogue,” he asserted.
Think tanks
He also lamented that since the Salman Rushdie affair, foreign media and think tanks concentrated on Pakistan’s extremes and generalised the whole society. “If you concentrate on any society’s extremes then you will speak a lot of bad things about it,” he observed.
Holding the ‘unjust three-tier education system’ as being majorly responsible for the extremes in Pakistani society as it produced three groups that had no connection with each other, the PM said: “I expect that now the time has come to research, bring original thought and define our country instead of someone from outside doing it [for us].
“The more the credibility of your think tanks increases, the easier it will be for us to define ourselves in the world,” he said.
The problem of a lack of state narrative was not unique to Pakistan, the PM said, adding out that the rest of the Muslim world also lacked think tanks with the result that it could respond to western criticism or Islamophobia. The Muslim population in the West had to face hardships due to lack of response from the Islamic world’s leadership, he added.
“If there were think tanks in the Muslim world, then they would have taken up the issue.
“It is our misfortune the kind of racist government that is there [in India] and the fascist policies it has and what it is doing with its minorities and especially in Kashmir. Unfortunately there are no think tanks in our Muslim world that can project this issue,” he said.
In the context of Afghanistan, the premier said despite becoming the worst victim of decades-long civil strife, Pakistan was blamed for all that had gone wrong. “Pakistan is the biggest victim in the decades-long civil strife, and had to bear the collateral damage. Yet we were blamed for double standards, and this is all owing to our policy of appeasement,” he noted.
State narrative ‘defaced’
Regarding the US aid received by Pakistan for ‘war on terror’, Mr Khan explained: “The miniscule aid that came our way was nothing as compared to the sacrifices and services that Pakistan had rendered. We lost 80,000 people, 40 million people displaced and a suffered loss of around $100 billion. This is what we had to pay and yet Pakistan was blamed for all that went wrong.”
He also hinted at pro- and anti-US lobbies in Pakistan who did a great injustice to the country, and its narrative was defaced.

1,First Omicron case in Pakistan confirmed,ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Monday reported its first confirmed case of the Omic­ron variant of Covid-19. The virulent strain was found,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Monday reported its first confirmed case of the Omic­ron variant of Covid-19.
The virulent strain was found in a female patient from Karachi and was confirmed by the National Institute of Health (NIH) through whole-genome sequencing.
In an official statement, the NIH said it was the first confirmed case and that continued surveillance of suspected samples was in place to identify the trends.
It highlighted the importance of getting vaccinated to protect oneself from serious effects of the various prevailing strains.
“Get yourself vaccinated according to guidelines issued by the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC),” the NIH said in its statement.
It is worth mentioning that on Dec 8, the Sindh government had claimed that although genomic study had to be done for confirmation, the way the virus was behaving in the female patient showed that it was Omicron.
The matter was widely circulated in media which was reporting it as the first case of the virulent strain. However, the very next day, the NIH issued a clarification, stating that the sample was yet to be confirmed as Omicron via whole-genome sequencing.
Following the confirmation, the NCOC once again called on people to get vaccinated to avoid chances of serious infection.
“In wake of recent confirmation of Omicron in Pakistan, the importance of getting vaccinated to protect from serious effects of existing and new variants is further highlighted. Please get yourself completely vaccinated,” the forum tweeted.
Omicron has spread to over 60 nations due to which several countries have imposed travel curbs.
Talking to Dawn, University of Health Sciences (UHS) Vice Chancellor Dr Javed Akram said Omicron had 50 variations/mutations and was reported in Africa where the vaccination ratio was just 6 per cent.
“People should get themselves vaccinated to create herd immunity, reduce chances of variation and eradicate the virus so that we can start living a normal life again. The most virulent variant of Covid-19 is still Delta, which is infecting 95pc of the people across the globe, including Pakistan, Dr Akram said, adding that Omicron can be more transmissible but it is showing mild symptoms, especially among vaccinated people.
Meanwhile, the NCOC data recorded six deaths and 244 new cases during the last 24 hours, with the national positivity rate calculated at 0.61pc.
The number of active cases was 9,048 as of Dec 13, with 766 patients under treatment in hospitals.

2,Centre to stop financing provincial uplift projects,Wants provinces to take full fiscal responsibility of all devolved subjects.,"ISLAMABAD: With increasing resource crunch, the Centre has decided in principle to stop financing provincial development projects, particularly those relating to devolved subjects, to shift to the federating units the financial burden that now stands at above Rs320 billion.
This is part of a new National Development Framework (NDF) under which the federal government wants to restrict its investment priorities to the areas of federal responsibilities and ensure that the provinces take full fiscal responsibility of all devolved subjects. The issue was discussed at a special meeting of the Central Development Working Party (CDWP) on Monday. It was presided over by Deputy Chairman of Planning Commission (DCPC) Mohammad Jehanzeb Khan.
A senior Planning Commission official told Dawn that 16 federal ministries had been devolved along with development projects to the respective provinces following the 18th Constitution Amendment and abolition of Concurrent List. The financing of projects of provincial nature was discouraged through the Federal Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) except for core vertical projects of health and population till 2017.
The financial burden on the federal budget, however, kept on increasing despite the fact that its fiscal share in divisible pool is shrinking from over 57 per cent to about 45pc under the 7th National Finance Commission (NFC) award almost at the same time. The provincial projects have since then crept back into the federal PSDP, leaving a limited fiscal space for projects of national importance.

Wants provinces to take full fiscal responsibility of all devolved subjects

“In PSDP 2021-22, about 331 are provincial nature projects worth Rs1.151 trillion (among about 1,190 total PSDP projects),” said the official, adding that about Rs345bn had already been spent by the Centre on these projects with an allocation of Rs330bn. These projects should be financed by the provinces themselves, he added.
Reviewing the policy guidelines during the CDWP meeting, the “DCPC highlighted that Planning Commission is in the process of developing an NDF which will guide priorities for investment by the federal government”, said an official statement, adding that “there are overlaps in rules of business and there is a need to carve out roles and responsibilities at the federal and provincial levels”.
The NDF will also be presented to the provinces for feedback before taking it to the National Economic Council, said the statement.
The meeting noted that because of provincial burden the federal mega projects of national importance were suffering on account of cost overruns and delays. It said the NEC had already decided in principle at the time of budget for this year that it was becoming impossible for the Centre to finance provincial projects, except for social sector projects under SDGs.
Under the existing policy approved by the NEC in June, the provinces are required to bear the cost of land acquisition, resettlement, provincial taxes and cost of project monitoring units and ensure their sustainable operation and maintenance.
The meeting proposed a review of SDG-related projects to rationalise their fiscal burden on the Centre and the provinces would not, by policy, demand financing projects of provincial nature through the PSDP.
The prime minister will also be requested to approve a policy under which schemes proposed by the parliamentarians be referred to the provinces for inclusion in the provincial annual development plans.
The official statement said the CDWP discussed the policy guidelines for “financing of provincial nature projects through federal PSDP, allocation of a percentage of total outlay in PSDP for running an effective media campaign for PSDP projects, draft of the gender policy framework, pilot research study on making public sector workplaces conducive for women and voluntary national review (VNR)”.
Discussing the “draft of the gender policy framework”, the chair emphasised the need for creating opportunities for girls and women to empower them in the process of decision-making and recognise their representation in all spheres of life.
He said the national outlook on gender was needed. The importance of gender needs to be understood across ministries and in provinces as indicators on gender are not very good. Action plans to be developed for gender programming and showing their commitment towards the is important aspect.
A yearly report on ‘status of gender’ in Pakistan will be issued by the Planning Commission. For making the workplace conducive for women reviews will be held quarterly and surveys carried out to determine progress.
Jehanzeb Khan stated that guidelines and ministry-wise sectoral guidelines should also be developed, adding that clarity is needed under various areas and the nature of projects.

3,IHC suggests treason trial over enforced disappearances,AG seeks time to share with govt the proposal of officials’ trial in missing person cases,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday proposed that state functionaries responsible for providing protection to citizens should be tried on a high treason charge for enforced disappearances.
IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah, who made the observation during the hearing of a petition seeking safe recovery of ‘missing’ journalist Mudassir Mehmood Naaru, observed enforced disappearances gave the impression that state was behind such a heinous crime.
Since the buck stops at the federal government, the head of government should identify those individuals in the institutions under his command who are found to be behind enforced disappearances, the chief justice said. Summoning officials of subordinate departments answerable to the prime minister and federal cabinet would be a futile exercise, he added.
Attorney General Khalid Jawed Khan assured the court of extending full cooperation for strengthening the democratic government and upholding the rule of law. He, however, sought time from the court to communicate the suggestions to the federal government.

AG seeks time to share with govt the proposal of officials’ trial in missing person cases

Subsequently, the court adjourned further hearing for four weeks.
Imaan Zainab Hazir-Mazari, counsel for the family of the missing journalist, argued that officials of the spy agency should be held responsible for enforced disappearance of any citizen from their respective jurisdiction.
However, Advocate retired Lt Col Inamur Rahim argued that the PM and federal cabinet were responsible for the safety and security of citizens and if they would fail to protect the life of a citizen, then they were liable to be tried for subversion of the Constitution under the Rules of Business 1973.
Justice Minallah observed that even the media was not independent to cover miseries of ‘missing’ persons and their families. According to him, media in civilized societies gives vast coverage to such cases of enforced disappearance but Pakistani media seemed reluctant to carry even a photo of the children of a ‘missing’ person.
Referring to the ‘abduction’ of Assistant Director of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) Sajid Gondal, the IHC chief justice remarked that a young man had illegally been taken into custody and was forced to give the statement that he had gone “to the Northern Areas on his own”.
Justice Minallah then appreciated Prime Minister Imran Khan for holding a meeting with the family of the ‘missing’ journalist. The premier had met the aggrieved family last week.

4,"FIA charges against Shehbaz, Hamza in Rs16bn graft case",Claims it has unearthed the role of a Bahraini woman in the saga at the behest of former finance minister Ishaq Dar.,"LAHORE: The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) submitted the challan against PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif and son Hamza Shehbaz to a special court on Monday for their alleged involvement in laundering an amount of Rs16 billion in the sugar scam case.
In another development, the agency claimed it had unearthed the role of a Bahraini woman in the saga at the behest of former finance minister Ishaq Dar.
“The investigation team has detected 28 benami accounts of the Shehbaz family through which money laundering of Rs16.3bn was committed during 2008-18. The FIA examined the money trail of 17,000 credit transactions,” according to an FIA report.
The amount was kept in “hidden accounts” and given to Shehbaz in a personal capacity, the report added.
This amount (Rs16bn) has nothing to do with the sugar business (of Shehbaz family).The money received from the accounts of low-wage employees by Shehbaz was transferred outside Pakistan via hundi/hawala networks, ultimately destined for beneficial use of his family members, the FIA alleged.
The report further said that in 1998 Sadiqa Syed, a Barhrain national, had helped Shehbaz Sharif (then chief minister of Punjab) in laundering $5 million with the help of Ishaq Dar (then federal finance minister).
The FIA has nominated Shehbaz Sharif and his sons — Hamza and Suleman — as the principal accused in the case. Fourteen others have been named in the FIR under sections 5(2) and 5(3) (criminal misconduct) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, read with 3/4 of the Anti-Money Laundering Act.
“Eleven low-paid employees of the Sharif group who ‘held and possessed’ the laundered proceeds on behalf of the principal accused, are found guilty of facilitating money laundering. The three other co-accused of the Sharif group also actively facilitated the money laundering,” the agency said.
The benami accounts, which had deposits totalling Rs16.3bn, were not declared by the principal accused, according to the FIA.
“The onus of proving pecuniary resources disproportionate to known sources of income and acquired ostensibly through improper means, lies on public servants,” it said.
“Shehbaz Sharif, then CM of Punjab and Hamza, then an MNA, were given ample opportunities during investigation to explain the same. However, due to their persistent evasive attitude and total non-cooperation, they missed the opportunities.
“The exact role and guilt of Suleman will be determined upon his arrest/surrender, but the evidence suggests that he aided and abetted his brother Hamza and thus found guilty of same offence.”
The investigation agency further said Mr Shehbaz was so “non-cooperative” during questioning that when he was asked which of his sons controlled the Sharif group and Ramzan Sugar Mills (RSML), he expressed his ignorance.
“He said he did not know the reasons behind Suleman’s absconding to the United Kingdom. Similarly, Hamza’s non-cooperation with FIA was such that he even denied having knowledge of who deposited funds into his personal accounts.
“As CEO of the Sharif group/RSML, all record was under Hamza’s custody, but he extended no cooperation, purposefully, to frustrate the investigation.”
The report said Suleman Shehbaz, who had left the country for Britain in October 2018, was served three notices but he did not respond.
“The investigation of this case entails unwinding of a complex financial matrix of layering/mega money laundering of billions of rupees. Hence it was very time-consuming and wide in scope.
“Despite the evasive and non-cooperative attitude of the accused, the investigation team detected 57 very high turnover fictitious ID/benami bank accounts in the name of individuals and fictitious business entities having over 55,000 inward (credit) and outward (debit) transactions between 2008 and 2018,” the agency said.
Shehbaz Sharif and Hamza have secured pre-arrest bail in the case till Dec 16.
Earlier, the FIA had accused the prime suspects of money laundering worth Rs25bn, but in the final report it said it was able to collect evidence for Rs16.3bn.
In a press release, Marriyum Aurangzeb, the PML-N’s information secretary, accused the Imran Khan-led government of trying to send Shehbaz Sharif to jail.

5,CAA hopes to resume licensing in February,Nine-member ICAO team carried out an audit in Pakistan for 10 days that concluded on Friday.,"KARACHI: Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA) hopes it can resume licensing pilots in February with the release of an International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) audit report after a scandal over fake licenses, an authority official said.
The ICAO, the UN Aviation body, advised Pakistan in September 2020 to undertake immediate corrective action and suspend the issue of any new pilot licences after false licences came to light following the crash of a Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) plane in May that year, in which 97 people were killed.
A nine-member ICAO team carried out an audit in Pakistan for 10 days that concluded on Friday.
“We are hopeful we will resume issuance of licensing following the release of the ICAO audit report expected in February,” Khaqan Murtaza, director general of the PCAA, told reporters on Monday.

ICAO told Pakistan in Sept 2020 to suspend issue of any new pilot licences after false licences came to light

The pilot licence scandal tainted Pakistan’s aviation industry and hurt flag carrier PIA, which was barred from flying to Europe and the United States.
In June last year, Pakistan grounded 262 airline pilots suspected of dodging their exams following checks of their qualifications.
The action was prompted by the preliminary report on an airliner crash in Karachi last year, which found that the pilots had failed to follow standard procedures and disregarded alarms.
The situation is that they have cleared us but a final report is awaited. The report is expected any time after mid-February, Murtaza said.
The audit was carried out in six areas airworthiness, flying standards, personal licensing and examination, air navigation services, aerodromes and aircraft accident.
The ICAO team visited Pakistan aeronautical complex, PIA offices and offices of other airlines.

6,Health card in Punjab termed a ‘defining moment’,• Each family allowed to spend Rs1m on healthcare  • Buzdar says 25 hospitals being set up,"

LAHORE: Prime Minister Imran Khan addresses the inauguration ceremony of Naya Pakistan Sehat Card here on Monday.—PPI

 
• Each family allowed to spend Rs1m on healthcare
• Buzdar says 25 hospitals being set up
LAHORE: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Monday launched the ‘Naya Pakistan Sehat Card’, calling it a defining moment and a big leap towards the creation of a welfare state on the lines of the state of Madina.
Speaking at the launching ceremony of the health card at the Governor House here, the prime minister said it would be handed out to some 30 million families to avail health insurance for 115 million people across Punjab. Each family in the province would be able to spend up to Rs1 million on quality healthcare from designated public and private sector hospitals. “The process of delivering health cards to everyone in Punjab will be completed by March,” he added.
Mr Khan said the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government would inject Rs440 billion into this health insurance scheme in three years. “This is not a mere health insurance but a system that will drive the private sector to establish hospitals in the peripheries and far-flung areas to offer quality healthcare,” he said and acknowledged that public hospitals and basic health units were deserted because no doctor was willing to go and serve in far-off areas.
“Since the death of my mother from cancer, I always wanted to establish a system where a financially poor person felt confident in receiving quality healthcare,” Mr Khan said and added that the health card facility would go a long way in boosting the confidence of the under-privileged across Punjab.
The prime minister said prosperity knocked at the doors of a state that inculcated humanity in its population, adding that the state of Madina had risen from abject poverty. However, he said, successive governments and rulers in Pakistan during the past 74 years continued waiting for prosperity and never took a step to create a welfare state.
Talking about his journey to establish Shaukat Khanum Cancer Hospital, he said he started with no money in his hands and was now able to build two hospitals in Lahore and Peshawar while a third was being established in Karachi. He said 75 per cent of the patients were being offered costly cancer treatment for free.
Referring to the coronavirus pandemic and inflation hitting the country, the premier said the opposition continued criticising him for at least three months for not imposing a complete lockdown. “I kept asking them who will feed the venders and daily-wage earners if a lockdown is imposed,” he remarked, adding that the opposition didn’t have an answer.
He said the opposition cited examples of Indian premier Narendra Modi, and demanded lodging of cases against him if a person died of coronavirus. Now, he claimed, Pakistan’s actions during the pandemic were being viewed as examples for the rest of the world and an international magazine had lauded the country for saving people and the economy.
Earlier, Chief Minister Usman Buzdar said the Punjab government was establishing 25 new hospitals in the province besides nine others under the social welfare department.
Health Minister Dr Yasmin Rashid said the provincial government had already delivered health cards to 5.2 million families living below poverty line. Later, she said, the cards were handed over to 3.3 million families in poorer divisions of Sahiwal and Dera Ghazi Khan.
