Umair Naseer of Topline Securities attributed a drop in November sales to rising financing rates, stringent financing requirements by the central bank, and the year-end phenomenon when car sales tend to slow down in general.

2,Remittances rise 10pc to $13bn in five months,"Analysts believe increasing inflow is normal because of tight rules, vigilance against transactions through illegal channels.","KARACHI:  Remi­ttances sent by overseas Pakistani workers fell 6.6 per cent on a  month-on-month basis in November but grew by almost 10pc in the first  five months of the current fiscal year.
The  State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) data issued on Monday showed that the inflow of  remittances was $2.35bn in November against $2.517bn in  October. The country had received $2.7bn remittances in September. 
However, during  July-November the remittances increased by 9.7pc to $12.9bn  against $11.7bn in the same period of FY21. The SBP noted that workers’ remittances continued their strong streak of remaining above $2bn since June 2020.
Due  to the tremendous pressure of rising import bill the country has been facing a tough time from the lenders while the continuous depreciation of the  rupee against the US dollar is a reflection of the weak position of the  economy, particularly on the external front.
The  goods import bill on average per month is about $6.5bn in FY22  indicating a difficult situation for the country to meet the increasing  gap between inflows and outflows. The country is expecting to receive  about $1bn from the IMF while planning to raise $1bn-$1.5bn through the issuance of sukuk  (Islamic bonds).
However, the widening trade gap could further  increase the current  account deficit (CAD) which has been a burning issue for the government.  It succeeded to bring down the CAD from  $20bn in 2018 to $1.9bn in FY21 but once again it has started crawling  up reaching $5bn in the first four-month (July-October) of 2021-22.
The  details of the  remittances showed that the highest inflow was from Saudi Arabia at  $3.271bn in the July-November period with a negative growth of 1.8pc  compared to $3.33bn in the same period of last fiscal year.
Saudi Arabia also placed $3bn in the  account of State Bank recently to strengthen the foreign exchange  reserves that have been declining since July.
Surprisingly,  the inflows from the European Union countries jumped by 41pc to  $1.442bn in 5MFY22 against $1.02bn in the same period of last year.
Remittances  from the United Arab Emirates rose just 0.4pc to $2.453bn in the period under review.  The inflows from the United Kingdom and the United States were $1.768bn  and  $1.3bn, registering a growth of 14pc and 30pc respectively.
Overseas Pakistani workers from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries remitted $1.452bn  during the July-November period, posting a growth of 8.5pc over the same period last year.
Some  analysts believe the increasing inflow of remittances is normal because  of tight rules and strict vigilance against transactions through  illegal channels. However, they also believe the higher import bill was  also normal because smuggling has been controlled so the importers are  billing officially.

3,Asaan Mobile Account to bring 50m under banking net: SBP chief,Customers will have choice to choose from any of the 13 branchless banking service providers that are currently offering the AMA.,"KARACHI: The Asaan Mobile Account (AMA) with its ease of use will be instrumental in bringing the next 50 million Pakistanis under the banking ambit, said State Bank of Pakistan Governor Dr Reza Baqir at the launch ceremony on Monday.
“The AMA will particularly help low-income segments with non-digital phones and no access to internet to enjoy financial services as accounts can now be opened simply by dialing a USSD [Unstructured Supplementary Service Data] code *2262# from any mobile phone (smart or simple feature phone) through any mobile network, without requiring internet connectivity,” Mr Baqir explained.
Customers will have the choice to choose from any of the 13 branchless banking service providers that are currently offering the AMA.

Customers can avail financial services by dialing *2262#

The SBP governor said that the AMA would play an important role in enhancing digital access and the use of formal financial services. “Pakistan has over 187 million biometrically verified mobile phone subscribers with teledensity of around 85 per cent. However, there are only 106 million 3G/4G subscribers with mobile internet penetration standing at 48pc,” he added.
“This gives us the potential market of around 81m mobile subscribers which don’t have access to the internet and could become users of AMA if provided with the right value proposition,” said the governor.
Moreover, AMA will be a highly suitable platform to onboard Pakistani women customer segments as well since they face greater obstacles in accessing formal financial services due to mobility, cultural and documentation issues, he added. This initiative is also in line with the government’s holistic approach of Digital Pakistan to enhance access and connectivity, digital infrastructure, and innovation. Now, the government will also have the option to use this channel for disbursing money under the flagship poverty alleviation Ehsaas Programme to reach 15 million beneficiaries.
The AMA allows the opening of a branchless banking account by dialing *2262# and the account holder can then deposit money in his or her account at any branchless banking agent and use the same for transactions through mobile phone. The AMA is an initiative of SBP to achieve the National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) target of promoting digital financial inclusion.
The AMA has been launched with the key support of various stakeholders including the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), National Data Registration Authority, branchless banking providers, cellular mobile operators and Virtual Remittance Gateway (VRG).
The VRG has been licensed jointly by the SBP and PTA under the regulations for mobile banking interoperability.
The ceremony also witnessed the signing of a memorandum of understanding among 13 branchless banking service providers.

This has been made possible by the hard work of our exporters, the adviser said, adding that they deserved praise for this accomplishment. 
Meanwhile, Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has clarified that service charge of Rs1 is collected on all invoices issued by Tier-1 Retailers integrated with FBR’s electronic system of real-time reporting of sales. It is only Rupee 1 per invoice, the FBR said.

5,Fertiliser Review Committee takes note of urea shortages,Federal Minister Khusro Bakhtyar directs provincial authorities to carry out vigilant border monitoring.,"ISLAMABAD:  As wheat-growing areas are facing urea shortages despite 11 per cent  higher production, the Fertiliser Review Committee on Monday directed  the interior  ministry to check if the fertiliser is being  smuggled to Afghanistan  due to a massive price differential between the locally manufactured and the imported urea.
Chairing the committee meeting Minister for Industries and Production Makhdum  Khusro Bakhtyar directed  that provincial authorities carry out vigilant border monitoring to avoid  inter-provincial supplies anomalies and rationalise urea supplies as  per the wheat production in the districts.
He also directed the  manufacturers to check their Punjab-based dealers whether they were  supplying urea to their counterparts in other provinces. The  committee also decided that all the vehicles involved in  inter-provincial movement needed to have active tracker systems to  locate the exact movement of the trucks.
The fertiliser industry  assured the committee of operating the manufacturing units at full  capacity to meet the monthly needs of soil nutrients during the ongoing  rabi season.
However, the  manufacturers welcomed the committee’s actions that have brought down  urea prices to around Rs1,800 and Rs1,900 per bag from Rs2,500 to  Rs2,800 at the start of the current month. “Timely action by the  government has ensured adequate availability and a significant reduction  in urea prices which have come close to the prescribed rate of Rs1,768,”  Imran Ahmed, CFO Engro Fertiliser, said representing the manufacturers.
He  added that black marketing and profiteering by hoarders have largely  been controlled due to restrictions on the movement of urea to  non-wheat-producing areas.
He told the committee that the urea sales were  high this year due to the agriculture-friendly policies and  significantly lower prices.
The committee was informed that a  record volume of 5.76 million tonnes was sold in the first 11 months of  calendar 2021, which is 11pc higher than the same period last year. “It  was unusual as urea consumption in India dropped by 5pc,” he added.

6,"New terminals, more LNG cargoes to address crisis: Ogra","Ogra chairman Masroor Khan says government machinery is fully aware of issues faced by industrialists, domestic consumers.","KARACHI: Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) chairman Masroor Khan on Monday said that setting up of two liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and increasing the number of cargoes in next few years would help address the issue of gas shortage in the country.   
Speaking at the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) at the Federation House, he said the government machinery was fully aware of the issues faced by industrialists and domestic consumers. The Ogra chief said he was addressing all the 15 to 20 LNG associations and alliances of the country through the apex platform of FPCCI and they can be rest assured that their voice is being heard. 
Ogra Member Gas Muhammad Arif discussed the grave issues of safety and irregularities at the end of smaller retailers in the LNG and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) distribution and sales network across the country. He admitted that it would take some time to implement the standards at the small shops selling gas for the domestic and small-scale commercial consumption. 
He added that Ogra was working towards a system where every gas cylinder in the country would have a National Serial Number for safety, standardisation, certification, recertification and tracking.
