0,Australian Test skipper Paine steps down amid ‘sexting’ scandal,MELBOURNE: Tim Paine took over the Australian test cricket team captaincy following one of the country’s biggest...,"MELBOURNE: Tim Paine took over the Australian test cricket team captaincy following one of the country’s biggest and most embarrassing international scandals. 
He’s lost it following a more personal indiscretion. 
Distraught and in tears, Paine quit as Test captain on Friday in a bombshell announcement just weeks before the Ashes series against arch-rivals England after revelations he had been investigated and cleared by Cricket Australia over sexually explicit text messages sent to a female colleague four years ago. 
Veteran wicket-keeper Paine was named in a News Corp. report as being at the center of the sexting scandal. The 36-year-old appeared before media on Friday in Adelaide to announce he was resigning the captaincy but wanted to remain a member of the Test squad. 
The announcement comes less than three weeks before the Dec 8 start in Brisbane of the five-Test Ashes series against England. 
Paine, who underwent surgery in September to repair a pinched nerve in his neck and isn’t a certainty to be a starter in the Ashes series, became Test captain in March 2018 after Steve Smith lost the role following the sandpaper ball-tampering scandal in South Africa. 
During the third test match against South Africa at Newlands in Cape Town, Cameron Bancroft was caught by television cameras trying to rough up one side of the ball with sandpaper. Smith and vice-captain David Warner were found to be involved and all three received sanctions from Cricket Australia, and when Smith was dumped as captain, Paine took charge. 
Until Friday. 
Breaking down while reading from a statement, Paine admitted he had been investigated by the sport’s national integrity unit over messages he sent to a former Cricket Tasmania staffer in 2017, months before he was recalled to the Test team after a seven-year absence. 
Though cleared of wrongdoing, the husband and father-of-three said, on reflection, his actions had not met the standards of an Australian cricket captain or the wider community. 
“I’m deeply sorry for the hurt and pain that I have caused to my wife, my family, and to the other party,” Paine told reporters. “I’m sorry for any damage that this does to the reputation of our sport and I believe that it is the right decision for me to stand down as captain, effective immediately.” 
Cricket Australia’s statement said its board had accepted Paine’s resignation and will look to appoint a new Test captain. 
“Tim felt it was in the best interests of his family and Australian cricket to take this decision to step down as captain,” CA board chairman Richard Freudenstein said. “While the board acknowledges an investigation cleared Tim of any breach of the code of conduct regarding this matter some years ago, we respect his decision. 
“CA does not condone this type of language or behavior. Despite the mistake he made, Tim has been an exceptional leader since his appointment and the board thanks him for his distinguished service.”  
Cricket Australia said Paine “will continue to be available for selection in the test team through the Ashes summer. He was among the 15 players named earlier this week for the Ashes. 
Paine said at the media conference that he thought the matter had been dealt with several years ago. 
“I spoke to my wife and family at the time and am enormously grateful for their forgiveness and support,” Paine said. “We thought this incident was behind us and that I could focus entirely on the team, as I have done for the last three or four years. However, I recently became aware that this private text exchange was going to become public.” 
Paine said he didn’t want the scandal to become “an unwelcome disruption to the team ahead of what is a huge Ashes series.” 
The series is one of the most anticipated in world cricket. After the opening Test in Brisbane, further matches are scheduled for Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney and Perth. 
“I have loved my role as captain of the Australian cricket team,” Paine said. “I’m grateful for the support of my team-mates and proud of what we’ve been able to achieve together. To them, I ask for their understanding and forgiveness. To Australian cricket fans I’m deeply sorry that my past behavior has impacted our game on the eve of the Ashes.” 
Cricket Tasmania released a statement Friday saying the allegations against Paine were only raised when the female employee was charged with theft. Chairman Andrew Gaggin said no complaint was made until mid-2018 following the message exchanges in November 2017. 
“As soon as Cricket Tasmania was made aware, it undertook an investigation that determined the interaction was consensual, private, occurred on the one occasion only, was between mature adults and was not repeated,” Gaggin said. 
When Paine took the captaincy in 2018, he was perceived as a cleanskin in a tainted outfit. 
He became the face of a campaign to win back trust, and to replace the laddish, hard-charging culture of Australian cricket with one of “elite honesty.” 
Some eighteen months into his captaincy, he was hailed a national hero as Australia retained the Ashes in England for the first time in nearly 20 years. 
Paine’s leadership lost some of its lustre as Australia succumbed to a depleted India 2-1 on home soil last summer. But the chance remained to redeem that loss against England in the Ashes. 
He resigns after 23 Tests as captain, with 11 wins, eight losses and four draws. 
Vice-captain Pat Cummins will be expected to take the captaincy, making him only the second specialist fast bowler in the role since Ray Lindwall led in one Test against India in the mid-1950s. 
Paine’s place in the dressing room, however, remains on far shakier ground.

1,WTA threatens to pull events out of China over Peng,Former doubles world number one Peng has not been seen or heard from publicly since Nov 2.,"BEIJING: An outcry over the whereabouts of Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai escalated on Friday as the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) said it was prepared to pull its tournaments out of China over the issue, prompting an influential Chinese state media editor to criticise the organisation for using a  “coercive tone”.
Former doubles world number one Peng has not been seen or heard from publicly since she said on Chinese social media on Nov 2 that former vice-premier Zhang Gaoli coerced her into sex and they later had an on-off consensual relationship.
Neither Zhang or the Chinese government have commented on her allegation. Peng’s social media post was quickly deleted and the topic has been blocked from discussion on China’s heavily censored internet.
Concern among the global tennis community and beyond has grown over Peng’s safety and whereabouts since her allegation, with the WTA calling for an investigation. Some of the world’s top tennis players, including Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka, as well as the German Olympic Committee, have tweeted.
The issue has also emerged as China prepares to host the Winter Olympics in Beijing in February amid calls from global rights groups and others for a boycott over its human rights record. The International Olympic Committee has declined to comment on Peng’s matter, saying it believed  “quiet diplomacy” offered the best opportunity for a solution.
WTA chief executive Steve Simon told CNN and other US media outlets on Thursday the tour would consider pulling tournaments worth tens of millions of dollars out of China.
In a statement to Reuters on Friday, Simon said the WTA was  “at a crossroads” with China.
“We continue to call for independent and verifiable proof that Peng Shuai is safe and that her sexual assault allegation will be investigated fully, fairly and without censorship. If not, the WTA is prepared to do what is right,” he said.
Hu Xijin, the editor of the Global Times, responded to Simon’s comments to CNN on Friday on Twitter, saying  “don’t use a coercive tone” when expressing any concern to China.

2,A.B. de Villiers announces retirement from all cricket,"JOHANNESBURG: A.B. de Villiers retired from all cricket on Friday, ending a career that saw him flourish into one of...","JOHANNESBURG: A.B. de Villiers retired from all cricket on Friday, ending a career that saw him flourish into one of his generation’s most gifted batsmen in any format, whether in test matches for his country or Twenty20 games for club teams across the world. 
De Villiers had retired from all international cricket with South Africa in May 2018 but was in talks about a return to the limited overs side for the Twenty20 World Cup before deciding against playing for the Proteas again. 
The 37-year-old remained a highly-sought after commodity and continued playing in various domestic T20 leagues, most noticeably with Indian Premier League’s Royal Challengers Bangalore, who described his retirement as the “end of an era” after a decade with the south Indian side. 
“It has been an incredible journey, but I have decided to retire from all cricket,” de Villiers said on his official Twitter account.  “Ever since the back yard matches with my older brothers, I have played the game with pure enjoyment and unbridled enthusiasm. 
“Now, at the age of 37, that flame no longer burns so brightly. That’s the reality I must accept — and, even if it may seem sudden, that is why I am making this announcement today. I’ve had my time. Cricket has been exceptionally kind to me.” 
Praise poured in for de Villiers, with former South African captain Graeme Smith calling him  “probably the best player across all three formats that I played with or against in my career”. 
An explosive and entertaining batsman who also kept wickets, de Villiers has often been referred to as “Mr 360” for his wide range of shots. 
He holds the record for the fastest ODI century, reaching triple figures in just 31 deliveries in a knock of 149 against the West Indies in Johannesburg in 2015, smashing 16 sixes and nine boundaries. 
De Villiers gave up playing for his country three years ago while still at the top of his game and after being pivotal in a Test series victory over Australia. Then, he spoke about the demands playing placed on him and his family, particularly for a player who was one of the first names on South Africa’s team-sheet in every format and for every series. 
The first signed for Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2011, and had three years to concentrate on playing for them after giving up internationals. There, he struck up a close friendship and highly productive on-field partnership with India captain Virat Kohli. 
Kohli, who once described de Villiers as the IPL’s “most impactful match-winner”, said his decision to retire “hurts his heart” but knew it was made keeping the South African’s family in mind. 
“To the best player of our times and the most inspirational person I’ve met, you can be very proud of what you’ve done and what you’ve given to RCB, my brother,” Kohli said on Twitter. “Our bond is beyond the game and will always be.” 
De Villiers also played T20 cricket for teams in Australia, Pakistan and Barbados toward the end of his career. 
“I am aware that nothing would have been possible without the sacrifices made by my family ... I look forward to the next chapter of our lives when I can truly put them first,” de Villiers said.

3,England’s Stone considering retirement from Tests,LONDON: England fast bowler Olly Stone is considering retirement from test cricket due to his latest back injury ...,"LONDON: England fast bowler Olly Stone is considering retirement from test cricket due to his latest back injury that ruled him out of the upcoming Ashes in Australia, the 28-year-old said.
Stone underwent surgery for a stress fracture in his back in July, which kept him out of England’s squad for the five-test Ashes series that begins in Brisbane on Dec. 8.
“I’ve given myself the best possible chance of doing everything I can to play test cricket, and if it means I can’t, it would sit right with me if I have to call it a day in the longer format,” Stone told the BBC on Thursday.
A succession of injuries throughout his career has stunted Stone’s progress, with the paceman having played three tests for England after his debut in July 2019.
“If I’m being honest, I’ve had to properly think hard about whether I want to try and get back out there and do it again,” he added.
“This time I felt like I’d done everything I can off the field: diet, nutrition, even just getting fitter and stronger. In the past I thought it might have been a factor to why [the injury] was happening.”

4,India seal T20 series win over New Zealand,"India crossed the line in the 18th over having lost only three wickets, avenging their hammering by Black Caps in the World Cup.","RANCHI: India cruised to a second straight victory over World Cup runners-up New Zealand on Friday, giving new coach Rahul Dravid and new T20 captain Rohit Sharma their first series win.
Set 154 in front of a packed crowd in Ranchi, India crossed the line in the 18th over having lost only three wickets, avenging their eight-wicket hammering by the Black Caps in the World Cup.
India got off to a slower start than New Zealand, making 45 in the power play compared to the visitors’ 64.
But K.L. Rahul and Rohit, who took over as T20 captain from Virat Kohli after the World Cup, turned up the volume after the 10th over off some lacklustre bowling from Mitchell Santner and Trent Boult.
Rahul, who moved to his half-century in style with a low-trajectory six off Adam Milne, departed for 65 off 49 balls to a Glenn Philipps catch off the bowling of stand-in captain Tim Southee.
Rohit was dropped by Boult in the 10th over and went on to secure his 25th T20I half-century before handing a dolly catch to Martin Guptill to give Southee his second.
Suryakumar Yadav then chopped on for 1 to make it three wickets for Southee before Rishabh Pant finished the job with two successive sixes off Jimmy Neesham.Earlier, New Zealand’s openers got off to a flyer but tight Indian bowling restricted the visitors to 153-6.
World Cup runners-up New Zealand, put into bat, racked up 64 in the power play for the loss of just Martin Guptill.
But they struggled to score off the spin duo of Axar Patel and Ravichandran Ashwin and debutant seamer Harshal Patel. Guptill smashed 31 off 15 — despite a bouncer to the head — before skying a slower Deepak Chahar delivery into the gloves of Rishabh Pant.
Mark Chapman, coming off an impressive 63 in the first game, made 21 off 17 before being caught on the boundary by Rahul trying to direct a full Axar Patel delivery over the ropes. Shortly afterwards Daryl Mitchell went for a maximum off Harshal Patel but was snapped by Yadav having made 31 off 28.
Tim Seifert managed only 13 of 15 before hitting a reverse-scoop off Ravichandran Ashwin straight to Bhuvne­shwar Kumar on the edge of the ring.
Glenn Philipps briefly got the scorecard moving with 34 off 21 including three sixes before being caught at deep square leg off Harshal Patel.
Neasham departed for 3 and Mitchell Santner and Adam Milne struggled to score in the death overs against clever bowling from Chahar and Harshal Patel who finished with 2 for 25.

Third-ranked Alexander Zverev joined world number one Novak Djokovic and second-ranked Daniil Medvedev in the last four at the season-ending event for the top eight players by beating Hubert Hurkacz 6-2, 6-4 on Thursday.
Having qualified second in the Red Group behind Medvedev, Zverev’s semi-final opponent will be Djokovic, who won the Green group. 
Zverev lost to Djokovic at the Australian Open and US Open this year but beat the Serb at the Tokyo Olympics en route to the gold medal. 
“We played basically every single big event this year on hard court against each other,” Zverev said. “So it’s only right that we play each other here as well. ... It’s always close when we play each other, so I’m looking forward to hopefully another tough one.”
Zverev, the 2018 champion at the finals, didn’t face a single break point against Hurkacz, a first-time qualifier. 
Both players served 11 aces amid quick conditions inside the Pala Alpitour. 
“There is going to be a lot more long rallies [against Djokovic],” Zverev said. “I think we are going to run a lot more. I think we are going to suffer, in a way, a lot more, as well. 
“Every single match that we played we both needed to be at our best. One or two points decided the matches. I expect no different here.” 
Zverev’s victory meant that Medvedev’s final group match later against Jannik Sinner an alternate who replaced the injured Matteo Berrettini was largely meaningless. Still, Medvedev won 6-0, 6-7 (5-7), 7-6 (10-8) saving two match points in the third-set tiebreaker. 
Sinner put on a show for his fans in the stands despite eventually falling to a tight defeat after two and a half hours to end his first participation in the Finals. 
“I think if the season had gone on a bit longer he would have had a chance to come here straight, rather than as an alternate,” said Medvedev. 
“Hopefully next time if I win I can make it just a little bit shorter because I put on a show but I want to rest a little bit.”

11,English cricket racism row takes new turn with Hales blackface photo,LONDON: The racism crisis tearing through English cricket took yet another turn late Thursday following the ...,"LONDON: The racism crisis tearing through English cricket took yet another turn late Thursday following the emergence of photographs of Alex Hales in blackface, with the batsman saying it had been a “tribute” to the late US rapper Tupac Shakur. 
The pictures were published by Britain’s The Sun newspaper hours after former player Azeem Rafiq — whose revelations of the career-ending racism he suffered have sent shockwaves through the English game — admitted he had sent anti-Semitic messages as a teenager. 
In a statement, Hales told The Sun: “In 2009, I attended a New Year’s Eve musical tribute fancy dress party. I dressed in tribute to my musical hero, Tupac Shakur, someone who I’ve admired from childhood and, at the time, did not realise the offensive nature of this. 
“I echo my statement from earlier in the week and stress how much I deplore racism and discrimination in all its forms,” added the 32-year-old batsman, who now faces a fresh investigation after being suspended by England for a second positive drugs test in 2019. 
This week Rafiq told a parliamentary committee that Hales named his black dog ‘Kevin’ due to cricketer Gary Ballance’s use of the name as a derogatory term for people of colour, an accusation that prompted a  “categorical” denial from Hales. 
Hales’ statement on Thursday regarding the photographs led Julian Knight, the MP who chaired Tuesday’s committee hearing, to label the images “incredibly disturbing and offensive” as he warned “the very soul of English cricket is now at stake”. 
Rafiq was widely praised for giving a disturbing account of the racism he suffered during two spells with Yorkshire to Knight’s committee, having previously said the abuse had led him to contemplate taking his own life. 
The former off-spinner, whose case has led to further revelations at other English counties, told the committee: “Do I believe I lost my career to racism? Yes, I do.” 
But earlier on Thursday, The Times newspaper uncovered messages from Rafiq sent to former Warwickshire and Leicestershire player Ateeq Javid, in which Rafiq is seen to make disparaging comments about an unnamed Jewish person. 
Rafiq responded by tweeting: “I have absolutely no excuses. I am ashamed of this exchange and have now deleted it so as not to cause further offence. 
“I was 19 at the time and I hope and believe I am a different person today,” the 30-year-old Pakistan-born Rafiq added. “I am incredibly angry at myself and I apologise to the Jewish community and everyone who is rightly offended by this.” 
Board of Deputies of British Jews president Marie van der Zyl responded by saying: “Azeem Rafiq has suffered terribly at the hands of racists in cricket so he will well understand the hurt this exchange will cause to Jews who have supported him. 
“His apology certainly seems heartfelt and we have no reason to believe he is not completely sincere.” 
The consequences of Rafiq’s revelations for Yorkshire, one of English cricket’s oldest and most prestigious counties, have been devastating, with sponsors making a mass exodus and the club barred from hosting lucrative international matches. 
Both Yorkshire’s chairman and chief executive have resigned, with head coach Andrew Gale himself currently suspended pending investigations over a historical anti-Semitic tweet. 
Such is the dismay at how English cricket authorities have dealt with Rafiq’s case, the UK government threatened them with the  “nuclear option” of independent regulation on Thursday. 
England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chief executive Tom Harrison, who also testified to Knight’s committee on Tuesday, insisted his organisation was “fit for purpose” as both the promoter and regulator of the game.
But sports minister Nigel Huddleston warned that if the ECB “don’t get their act together, then we have the nuclear option of legislating in order to potentially bring in an independent regulator”. 
Harrison’s position has been called into question, with the Rafiq scandal and its fallout likely to dominate Friday’s all-game gathering of the ECB’s 41 constituent members at the Oval.
Were Harrison to be ousted now, however, it would leave a leadership vacuum following the resignation of ECB chairman Ian Watmore last month after the controversial decision to call off an England tour of Pakistan scheduled for October.

12,"PCB has 23 over-age employees, IPC Minister tells Senate","A senator said that while employment of former cricketer Wasim Bari could be justified, there was no justification for the others.","ISLAMABAD: At a time when unemployment is rife among the youth, the Pakistan Cricket Board has 23 over-age employees who are all contractual.
The matter came to light after Senator Irfan Siddiqui posed a question to Federal Minister for Inter-provincial Coordination Dr Fehmida Mirza, asking her about the number of employees over the age of 60 as well their salaries and the perks and privileges they enjoy. 
In a written response, Fehmida told the Senate that there are 23 employees of PCB, who are over 60 years of age.
“All such appointments are made in accordance with the applicable PCB rules regulations approved by Board of Governors,” she wrote. “Among the lists, there are some who were born in 1948, 1952, 1954 ans so on....”
A senator said that while the employment of former Pakistan Test cricketer Wasim Bari could be justified, there was no justification for the 22 others.
In response to another question, the IPC minister said that it would be incorrect to state that the PCB has done away with department cricket resulting in the unemployment of more than 2000 cricketers.
In her written reply, she said that after replacing department cricket with teams representing six Cricket Associations, a total of 192 players have been handed domestic contracts through which they are earning mounts raging from Rs2.5 million to 3.9 million per annum.  Whereas, the PCB introduced match fee for City Cricket Association, which is a source of income for approximately 1400 players.
She further said that over 200 coaches and support staff have been given contract under the current domestic structure while more than 20 umpires and match referees have been handed out contracts.
“PCB has taken unprecedented measure to create opportunities for and cater to welfare of all personal involved in domestic cricket,” she wrote.

13,Pakistan rally from 24-4 to beat Bangladesh in series opener,DHAKA: Pakistan recovered from a precarious 24-4 to beat Bangladesh by four wickets in the first Twenty20...,"DHAKA: Pakistan recovered from a precarious 24-4 to beat Bangladesh by four wickets in the first Twenty20 International of their three-match series on Friday. 
The match was in the balance with three overs to go at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium, then Shadab Khan and Mohammad Nawaz hit two sixes each and Pakistan reached 132-6 in 19.2 overs, knocking off Bangladesh’s 127-7. 
Fakhar Zaman and Khushdil Shah launched Pakistan’s recovery with a 56-run partnership for the fifth wicket. They scored 34 each, removed in quick succession when Fakhar chased a wide delivery of fast bowler Taskin Ahmed to edge to wicketkeeper Nurul Hasan, and Khushdil was undone by a slower ball outside off by pacer Shoriful Islam.
With the visitors needing 32 runs in the last three overs, Shadab and Nawaz pulled off a blitz to break Bangladesh’s stranglehold. 
It was Shadab who struck the winning six, leaving him unbeaten on 21 runs off 10 balls. 
“Credit to the middle order, the way they showed the skills. Fakhar, Khushdil, the way Nawaz finished,” said Pakistan captain Babar Azam. 
Nawaz was unbeaten on 18 off eight and Shadab struck an unbeaten 21 off 10, hitting the winning six by slog-sweeping leg-spinner Aminul Islam over deep midwicket. 
“We played like a unit,” Pakistan fast bowler Hasan Ali said. “Khushdil and Nawaz got the opportunity today and both delivered.”

Aminul, one of the home team’s specialist bowlers, came to bowl only in the last over when Pakistan needed two runs for the victory. 
“Since two left-hand batsmen were batting, we didn’t bring our leggie but it would have been better to get 140, Bangladesh captain Mahmudullah Riyad said. 
Pakistan made a cautious start on the slow pitch before Mohammad Rizwan’s stumps were rattled on 11 by fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman. 
Taskin removed Babar for seven as Bangladesh put Pakistan under pressure at the start of their innings. 
Haider Ali and Shoaib Malik both went for ducks, the former plumb leg before and Nurul showing presence of mind to run out the latter. 
Malik was strolling outside his crease after conceding a dot ball when Hasan threw it back onto the stumps, and replays showed the veteran campaigner was late to ground his bat. 
But Fakhar Zaman and Khushdil Shah put Pakistan back on track as Bangladesh failed to keep up the pressure to the end. 
The damage was ultimately done when they were restricted to 127, continuing a poor batting record that haunted Bangladesh in the T20 World Cup. The team has lost six straight T20s. 
Pakistan pacers Hasan, with 3-22, and Mohammad Wasim, 2-24, triggered a collapse, leaving Bangladesh at 40-4 in the ninth over. 
“I have been here during the BPL [Bangladesh Premier League] and I know it’s generally a slow pitch, Ali said. “So I bowled stump to stump and got wickets. 
Afif Hossain top-scored for the side with 36 and Mahedi Hasan was unbeaten on 30 to help them get past 100. 
Mahmudullah was sanguine about his choice to bat first. 
“When we chose to bat, it looked a good wicket. But there was help for the bowlers as well. It’s not an excuse,” he said. 
The second match of the series will be held at the same ground on Saturday.
