0,Thousands take to streets after river dries up in Iran's Isfahan,Energy minister apologises to farmers for being unable to provide water for their crops.,"TEHRAN: Thousands of protesters converged on Isfahan in central Iran on Friday to voice their anger after the city’s lifeblood river dried up due to drought and diversion.
The massive protest, which drew in farmers and other people from across Isfahan province, was the biggest since demonstrations over the water crisis started on November 9.
“Thousands of people from Isfahan, farmers from the east and west of the province, have gathered in the dry Zayandeh Rood riverbed with one key demand: let the river run,” a state television journalist in Isfahan reported, broadcasting live images of Friday’s rally.
“For years, there has been no will to resolve the problems of this important river,” the journalist said.
Footage aired on the channel showed men and women in a crowd spanning the riverbed clapping in unison.
“Plundered for 20 years” and “the water must return”, they chanted.
Others were seen holding up banners that read “East Isfahan has become desert” and “Our water is being held hostage”, in pictures published by Iranian media outlets.
The city of Isfahan is Iran’s third largest, with a population of around two million.
It is a tourist magnet due to its heritage sites, including a historic bridge that crosses the Zayandeh Rood river — which has been dry since the year 2000 apart from brief periods.
Drought is seen as one of the causes, but farmers also blame the authorities’ diversion of the river water to neighbouring Yazd province.
The Iranian government has promised to come to the aid of farmers and resolve the crisis.
“I have ordered the ministers of energy and agriculture to take immediate steps to deal with the issue,” Iran’s First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber said on television.
Energy Minister Ali-Akbar Mehrabian apologised to farmers for being unable to provide water for their crops.
“We hope to fill these gaps in the coming months,” he said.
Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi had already met with representatives from the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd and Semnan on November 11 and promised to resolve water issues.
Largely arid Iran has been suffering chronic dry spells for years.
In July, deadly protests broke out in the southwestern province of Khuzestan after drought led to widespread water shortages.
Iran is one of the most water-stressed countries in the world.
Water levels in the country’s lakes and reservoirs have halved since last year due to the severe drought affecting the country and the wider region, a report from Iran’s space agency said in October.

1,US indicts two Iranians for ‘poll meddling’,WASHINGTON: The US Justice Department has announced indictments of two Iranians who allegedly took part in an online...,"WASHINGTON: The US Justice Department has announced indictments of two Iranians who allegedly took part in an online “disinformation and threat” campaign to influence American voters in the 2020 presidential election.
Mohammad Hosein Musa Kazemi, 24, and Sajjad Kashian, 27, conducted a cyber campaign “to intimidate and influence American voters, and otherwise undermine voter confidence and sow discord,” the department said Thursday.
In parallel, the US Treasury announced sanctions on the two men and three others who ran the cybersecurity company they worked for, Emennet Pasargad.
The Treasury said the company was formerly known as Net Peygard Samavat, which was hit with sanctions in 2019, and the Justice Department gave its former name as Eeleyanet Gostar.
Iran hit back in a statement, saying “such accusations addressed by the US government, who itself has a long history of meddling in other countries’ affairs in different shapes and forms, are baseless”.
Such actions, foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said, aim to “deceive (American) public opinion.” Kazemi and Kashian allegedly obtained confidential voter information and sent menacing emails, pushing out false information to influence both Democratic and Republican voters, and attempting to hack into state voting-related websites, the department said.
In one case, they sent out mass emails claiming to be from the far-right Proud Boys militia group that threatened people to change political parties.
In another, they created and disseminated a video that purportedly showed a person hacking state voter websites and creating fraudulent ballots.
The indictment did not tie the two directly to the Iranian government, but noted that the company had done work for the government.
In 2019 the Treasury said Net Peygard Samavat worked with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
And in March 2021 US intelligence released a report that said the Iranian government was behind a multi-pronged influence campaign aimed at hurting former president Donald Trump’s reelection chances. Kazemi and Kashian are charged in federal court in New York with conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse for trying to intimidate voters, voter intimidation, and transmission of interstate threats.

2,US senators move to block $650m arms sale to Saudi Arabia,"“This sale could accelerate an arms race and jeopardise the security of our military technologies,” says Senator Rand Paul.","WASHINGTON: A group of US senators are opposing the Biden administration’s first major arms sale to Saudi Arabia over Riyadh’s role in the conflict in Yemen, three senators announced on Thursday.
A joint resolution of disapproval to block a proposed $650 million in US arms sales to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was introduced by Republicans Rand Paul and Mike Lee, as well as Bernie Sanders who caucuses with Democrats.
While many US lawmakers consider Saudi Arabia an important partner in the Middle East, they have criticized the country for its involvement in the war in Yemen, a conflict considered one of the world’s worst humanitarian disasters. 
They have refused to approve many military sales for the kingdom without assurances US equipment would not be used to kill civilians.
Activists have said Saudi Arabia has lobbied heavily against extending a mandate of United Nation investigators who have documented possible war crimes in Yemen by both the Riyadh-led coalition and the Houthi movement.
The package which was approved by the State Department would include 280 AIM-120C-7/C-8 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM), 596 LAU-128 Missile Rail Launchers (MRL) along with containers and support equipment, spare parts, US government and contractor engineering and technical support.
In a statement Paul said, “this sale that could accelerate an arms race in the Middle East and jeopardize the security of our military technologies.” 
“As the Saudi government continues to wage its devastating war in Yemen and repress its own people, we should not be rewarding them with more arms sales,” said Sanders in the joint statement.
Raytheon Technologies makes the missiles.
The Biden administration has said it adopted a policy of selling only defensive weapons to the Gulf ally.
When the State Department approved the sale a spokesman said the sale “is fully consistent with the administration’s pledge to lead with diplomacy to end the conflict in Yemen.” The air-to-air missiles ensure “Saudi Arabia has the means to defend itself from Iranian-backed Houthi air attacks,” he said.
State Department approval of a sale is not necessarily the indication of a signed contract.

3,Ex-lawmaker arrested in Myanmar for ‘masterminding’ anti-junta attacks,YANGON: Myanmar security forces have arrested a former lawmaker and prominent hip-hop artist accused of ...,"YANGON: Myanmar security forces have arrested a former lawmaker and prominent hip-hop artist accused of masterminding a string of attacks targeting regime forces and officials, the junta said on Friday.
Self-declared civilian “people’s defence forces” have sprung up to fight for democracy since the generals seized power in a February coup, with dissidents targeting officials perceived to be working with the junta.
Maung Kyaw, 40, was arrested from an apartment in the commercial hub Yangon following a “tip-off and cooperation from dutiful citizens,” the junta’s information team said.
The former lawmaker — who also goes by the name Phyo Zeya Thaw — was in possession of two pistols, ammunition and an M-16 rifle, it added.
Maung Kyaw had been accused of orchestrating several attacks on regime forces, including the brazen shooting on a commuter train in Yangon in August that killed five policemen.
A hip-hop pioneer in Myanmar whose subversive rhymes irked the previous junta, he was jailed in 2008 for membership in an illegal organisation and possession of foreign currency.
He was elected to parliament from Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party in the 2015 elections that ushered in a transition to civilian rule.
The Southeast Asian country has been in turmoil since the coup sparked massive protests and a bloody military crackdown on dissent, which has killed more than 1,200 people according to a local monitoring group.
The junta has stepped up arrests of dissidents in Yangon, which has been rocked by near-daily bomb blasts and shootings.
Earlier this month, a top executive from a major military-backed Myanmar telecoms firm was gunned down outside his home.

4,UN urges release of China journalist jailed over Covid reports,GENEVA: The United Nations on Friday urged China to release a citizen journalist jailed for her coverage of the...,"GENEVA: The United Nations on Friday urged China to release a citizen journalist jailed for her coverage of the country’s Covid-19 response and who is reportedly close to death after a hunger strike.
The UN rights office voiced alarm at reports that 38-year-old Zhang Zhan’s health was deteriorating rapidly and that her life was at serious risk from the hunger strike in detention.
“We call on the Chinese authorities to consider Zhang’s immediate and unconditional release, at the very least, on humanitarian grounds, and to make urgent life-saving medical care available, respecting both her will and her dignity,” spokeswoman Marta Hurtado said in a statement.
Zhang, a former lawyer, travelled to Wuhan in February 2020 to report on the chaos at the pandemic’s epicentre, questioning the authorities’ handling of the outbreak in her smartphone videos.
She was detained in May 2020 and sentenced in December to four years in jail for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” — a charge routinely used to suppress dissent.
She has conducted several hunger strikes to protest against her conviction, sentencing and imprisonment, and her family recently warned that she had become severely underweight and “may not live for much longer”.
Hurtado said the UN rights office had repeatedly raised concerns over Zhang’s case with the Chinese authorities since her arrest last year.
It had sought “clarification on the criminal proceedings taken against her as a consequence of what appear to have been her legitimate journalistic activities”, she said.
China has revelled in its success in keeping domestic Covid infections down to a trickle of sporadic outbreaks.
The government has put forward a narrative crediting the Communist Party with returning life almost to normal even as death tolls and infections continue to explode in the rest of the world.
But those who threaten the official version by raising questions about the government’s early handling of the Wuhan outbreak face the party’s wrath.
Zhang is among a group of four citizen journalists — along with Chen Qiushi, Fang Bin and Li Zehua — detained after reporting from Wuhan.
Hurtado stressed that “the free flow of relevant information is of particular importance in the early stages of crisis situations such as public health emergencies”.

5,Digging for gold in DR Congo: a desperate enterprise,"BUKAVU: “We enter the mine like animals, on all fours, and if we get tired, we slide down on our bums,” says...","BUKAVU: “We enter the mine like animals, on all fours, and if we get tired, we slide down on our bums,” says Hardy Bisi­mwa, a gold miner in DR Congo.
The 22-year-old toils away at a mine in Luhihi in South Kivu province without any kind of protection, his hands bare, a torch on his head.
Around two years ago, the area started attracting diggers when locals discovered a hill where they said you could “pick up gold from the ground”.
Since then, close to 200 families have set themselves up near the mine, living in makeshift wooden structures covered with blue tarpaulin.
Artisanal diggers have been recognised by law since December 2018, allowed to mine as long as they belong to a cooperative and pay their dues to the state.
The law though is rarely enforced and in Luhihi, police are nowhere to be seen. In the absence of the state, popular justice is meted out.
Didier Ciza, a civil society representative in Luhihi, complains that “all thieves are lynched”.
In just five months, seven miners have died in Luhihi, either following communal conflicts or asphyxiated underground.
And the gold itself remains elusive, as do the miners’ rewards.
“We don’t even have the means to find soap to wash ourselves,” says Bisimwa, his body covered in yellow dust from the clay soil.
In seven months, Bisimwa only found gold once.
But he says he’s not losing hope.
“With God’s help, I will still find some to provide for my wife and three children.” 
DR Congo’s soil is full of mineral wealth, be it gold, coltan, or cobalt.
Yet a large majority of the population lives on less than $1.90 a day, the international poverty rate, according to the World Bank.
Bertin Muruha, a 19-year-old who failed his final year school exam in 2019, also works in the underground labyrinth without a mask or helmet.
He toiled away for more than a year before bringing any gold back.
Carrying a bag full of stones that he dug up underground, he heads to the crusher, an old machine that smashes up the rocks.
In a little canal of water nearby, a man is already busy washing through his crushed mass to remove any impurities, without any gloves.
Any gold found is given to the local owners of the shafts who sell it to traders in Bukavu, capital of South Kivu.
In Luhihi, a kilo of gold fetches $450 — far below the global price for the precious metal. And 
even then, it’s unclear what the diggers themselves get for the few grams they find.
And local communities complain they are not seeing any of the benefits of the mining.
“This quarry no longer has enough gold,” says Sifa Nshobole, a local resident in Luhihi.
“If they find any, it doesn’t help us at all because the miners take all their production back to Bukavu.
“We... don’t benefit from anything at all.”

6,Hundreds try to cross EU border despite easing of crisis,"Council of Europe human rights commissioner calls the humanitarian situation along the border ""alarming"".","SOKOLKA: Hundreds of migrants have again tried to cross the border from Belarus into Poland, Warsaw said on Friday, despite signs of the crisis easing after migrants left a makeshift encampment.
Polish border guards said there were attempted crossings by two groups on what is the eastern border of the European Union and Nato — one involving 500 migrants, some of whom threw rocks and tear gas canisters.
The border guards said they had detained 45 migrants.
Belarusian state news agency Belta said 2,000 migrants who had been camped out in freezing conditions on the border spent the night in a nearby warehouse after clearing out of their camp.
Belta published photos of the migrants lying on mats in the facility and wrote that “for several it was their first warm night”.
The West accuses Belarus of artificially creating a crisis by bringing in would-be migrants and taking them to the border with promises of an easy crossing into the EU.
Belarus has denied this and urged the EU to take them in.
On Friday, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko spoke to his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, with the allies stressing “the importance of the establishment of cooperation between Minsk and the EU to resolve the problem,” according to the Kremlin.
‘Pushbacks must end’
The Council of Europe human rights commissioner Dunja Mijatovic called the humanitarian situation along the border “alarming” and demanded an end to Poland’s controversial returns of migrants back to Belarus.
“I have personally listened to the appalling accounts of extreme suffering from desperate people... who spent weeks or even months in squalid and extreme conditions in the cold and wet woods due to these pushbacks,” she said in a statement after a four-day mission to Poland.
“All pushbacks must end immediately.” She also called on Poland to allow rights activists and media “immediate and unimpeded access to all areas along the border”.
Belarus said Thursday that there were a total of around 7,000 migrants in the ex-Soviet country.
It said that it would take responsibility for sending around 5,000 of those migrants home and claimed that the EU would create a “humanitarian corridor” to Germany for around 2,000.
But Germany swiftly shot down that claim, saying it was not true that it would take in 2,000 migrants.
Meanwhile hundreds of Iraqis who had failed to cross into the EU from Belarus returned home on Thursday on the first repatriation flight organised by Baghdad.
Despite the repatriations, Poland said pressure on the border was continuing.
“There are still attempts by migrants to cross the border illegally,” said Marek Pietrzak, spokesman of Poland’s Territorial Defence Force, which has soldiers on the border.
Border guard spokeswoman Anna Michalska told AFP on Friday about an incident late on Thursday involving around 500 migrants.
“People in the largest group... threw rocks and someone also hurled tear gas at Polish officials. At the same time the Belarusian personnel were using lasers to blind them,” said She said four Polish soldiers had sustained injuries that did not require hospitalisation.

7,Harris becomes first woman to hold US presidential reins,Biden undergoes colonoscopy,"WASHINGTON: US Vice President Kamala Harris has become first woman in the American history who held presidential reins, although very briefly. She held presidential powers for a total of one hour and 25 minutes while President Joe Biden was under anesthetic, the White House said on Friday.
The White House press office said that official letters to Congress declaring the temporary transfer of power were sent at 10.10am. “The president resumed his duties at 11.35am,”, the White House said in a statement.
Biden is undergoing his annual physical at the Walter Reed military hospital outside of Washington. Harris is the first woman to serve as vice president of the United States; no woman has ever been president in the country’s nearly 250-year history.
“Following the process set out in the Constitution, Pres­ident Biden will transfer power to the Vice President for the brief period of time when he is under anesthesia,” White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said in a statement.

Biden undergoes colonoscopy

“The Vice President will work from her office in the West Wing during this time,” Psaki said.
Presidential power has been transferred to the vice pre­sident before, when Pres­ident George W. Bush had colonoscopies in 2002 and 2007.
Biden, who turns 79 on Saturday, is the oldest person to take office as U.S. president. Although speculation has persisted about whether he will run for re-election in 2024, he has said he expects to seek a second four-year term alongside Harris.
Biden has pledged to be more transparent about his health than predecessor Donald Trump. The Republ­ican visited Walter Reed in 2019 for an undisclosed reason that a former press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, later revealed was for a colonoscopy.
Biden, 78, had his last full exam in December 2019, when doctors found the former vice president to be healthy, vigorous and fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency,” according to a doctors report at the time. Biden, who turns 79 on Saturday, is the oldest person to serve as president, and interest in his health has been high since he declared his candidacy for the White House in 2019.
Dr Kevin OConnor, who has been Bidens primary care physician since 2009, wrote in a three-page note that the then-presidential candidate was in overall good shape.
In that report, OConnor said that since 2003, Biden has had episodes of atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heartbeat thats potentially serious but treatable. At the time, OConnor cited a list of tests that showed Bidens heart was functioning normally and his only needed care was a blood thinner to prevent the most worrisome risk, blood clots or stroke.
Biden had a brush with death in 1988, requiring surgery to repair two brain aneurysms, weak bulges in arteries, one of them leaking. Biden has never had a recurrence, his doctor said, citing a test in 2014 that examined his arteries.

8,France warns Iran against ‘sham’ negotiating stance,Tehran slams Western statement on its regional actions.,"PARIS: France’s foreign minister warned Iran on Friday not to come to the next round of talks on reviving the 2015 nuclear deal with a “sham” negotiating stance, a day after Paris urged the board of the UN atomic watchdog to send Iran a tough message.
Tehran had earlier responded to Paris by saying the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which verifies Tehran’s compliance with the 2015 deal with world powers limiting Tehran’s nuclear programme, must be “free of any political conduct”.
According to Reuters, the statements highlighted rising tension before the United States, Iran and world powers resume indirect negotiations on reviving the deal on Nov 29, five days after a meeting of the IAEA’s Board of Governors.
Western diplomats say time is running low to resurrect the pact, which then-US President Donald Trump abandoned in 2018, angering Iran and dismaying the other world powers involved — Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia.

Tehran slams Western statement on its regional actions

Six rounds of indirect talks were held between April and June. The negotiations were interrupted after the election of a new Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi, who has said Iran will not back down in the talks.
Paris warned Tehran over what US and European diplomats view as unrealistic demands, including a call for all US and EU sanctions imposed since 2017 to be dropped.
Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told Le Monde newspaper Paris wanted first to establish whether talks would resume where they ended in June.
Under the 2015 deal, Iran limited its nuclear programme in exchange for relief from sanctions. Trump’s 2018 decision to reimpose US sanctions prompted Tehran to begin breaching its nuclear restrictions.
Iran’s neighbours
In Tehran, according to AFP, the Iranian government on Friday criticised as “illegitimate” a Western statement that assured Arab allies their security interests would be taken into account during talks aimed at reviving the Iran nuclear deal.
Iran’s neighbours are concerned about concessions that could be made to the Islamic republic in the negotiations that are due to resume in the Austrian capital Vienna on November 29.
In a joint statement issued after talks on Thursday with Gulf states, Egypt and Jordan, the United States and the so-called E3 of Britain, France and Germany welcomed their “efforts to de-escalate tensions”.
They condemned Iran’s “destabilising activities in the region” including the use of ballistic missiles and drones, while affirming “their determination to continue to address broader security concerns of the region”.
Iran’s foreign ministry dismissed the statement on Friday.
“This spectacle of a meeting and statement are so fabricated and illegitimate that they are not worth responding to,” said its spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh.
“The US government, which is responsible for the current situation after withdrawing from the nuclear deal, is once again trying to provoke a crisis and conduct a propaganda campaign against Iran,” he said in a statement.
In 2018, under then president Donald Trump, the United States unilaterally pulled out of the deal that gave Iran relief from sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.

9,Key aid group says Afghanistan’s most pressing need is cash,The country is on brink of a humanitarian catastrophe.,"DUBAI: Afghanistan is facing a looming humanitarian crisis as aid organisations struggle with ways to pay doctors, nurses and others on the ground because there is currently no way to transfer salaries to bank accounts there, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross said.
ICRC President Peter Maurer’s comments echo those of the UN’s special representative for Afghanistan, who warned this week that the country is on the brink of a humanitarian catastrophe and that its collapsing economy is heightening the risk of extremism. The country’s economy is estimated to have contracted by 40 per cent since the Taliban took control in August.

The country is on brink of a humanitarian catastrophe

The Geneva-based ICRC, which has operated in Afghanistan for over 30 years, is temporarily carrying in bags of cash to the impoverished nation and converting dollars into the local currency, the afghani, in order to pay some of its staffers. The ICRC has been able to do this with regulatory approval by the US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. The ICRC also has an agreement with the Taliban-run Health Ministry that allows donor-funded payments to pass through the ICRC and bypass the Taliban, who have yet to be officially recognized by any nation.
“The main problem in Afghanistan is not hunger. The main problem is the lack of cash to pay salaries to deliver social services which have existed before,” Maurer told The Associated Press in an interview Thursday during a visit to Dubai.
“Let’s not forget that most of these medical doctors, nurses, operators of water systems and electricity systems are still the same people. It is the leadership which has changed, but not these people,” he added.
Afghanistan’s aid-reliant economy was thrown into deep turmoil following the Taliban takeover of the capital, Kabul, in August and the collapse of the US-backed Afghan government just weeks before the US withdrew its last troops.
The Taliban leadership, which recently banned all foreign currency transactions, has urged the US Congress to ease sanctions and release Afghanistan’s overseas assets in order for the government to be able to pay teachers, doctors and other public sector employees. After the Taliban takeover, the US froze nearly $9.5 billion in assets belonging to the Afghan Central Bank and stopped shipments of cash.
Since the Taliban’s ascension to power this past summer, it’s not been possible for international aid organizations to wire transfer payments to accounts in Afghanistan as currently international currency cannot be changed into local currency by a network of banks in the country.
Maurer said humanitarian organisations cannot fix an implosion of a whole country. He said what’s needed is an agreement on a sufficient injection of liquidity something he believes is possible without formally recognizing the Taliban.

For the last three decades, Lal carted passengers along bumpy thoroughfares to temples, markets and offices in New Delhi, working every day through the winter months when a pall of toxic smog settles over the sprawling megacity.
“The pollution causes a lot of problems for my throat,” the 58-year-old told AFP, after a morning spent in the driver’s seat of his motorised three-wheeler.
“My eyes sting... My lungs are affected, which creates breathing problems.
Mucus builds up and collects in my chest.” Delhi is consistently ranked the world’s worst capital for air quality and on its most polluted days the smog can cut visibility on the roads to barely 50 metres.
Levels of PM2.5 pollutants -- the microparticles most harmful to human health, which can enter the bloodstream through the lungs — last week reached more than 30 times the maximum daily limit recommended by the World Health Organization.
“I feel so sorry looking at children and their health,” said Lal. “They are already getting sick.” Lal’s business suffers and he sometimes drives around the streets for an entire day without finding passengers, who prefer paying extra to sit through their commutes inside a cab.
