• NAB had earlier challenged FIA’s jurisdiction
ISLAMABAD: The law ministry has given a go-ahead to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to proceed against the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) over its alleged negligence in the Broadsheet saga.  
The federal cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Imran Khan, had formed a one-man commission comprising retired Justice Sheikh Azmat Saeed in January this year to probe the execution of contract and payments to Broadsheet LLC in connection with investigation into the offshore properties of Pakistani politicians.  
The commission completed the probe in March and submitted its report to the Prime Minister Office. 
The federal cabinet in a subsequent meeting referred the matter to the FIA for thorough investigation. 
NAB, on the other hand, challenged the FIA’s jurisdiction and initially wrote to the agency, asking it to stop the probe until the cabinet reconsidered its decision on assigning the Broadsheet case to the investigation agency. 
The matter was then referred to the law ministry which opined that pursuant to the decision of the federal cabinet, the FIA had the authority to investigate the anti-graft watchdog. 
When contacted, Law Secretary Raja Naeem confirmed that the ministry had furnished an opinion in this matter. 
A member of the federal cabinet, on condition of anonymity, told Dawn that since the Broadsheet case was related to NAB, its investigation could not have been assigned to the bureau. 
He said the FIA had been asked to probe any negligence on the part of the anti-graft watchdog and also fix responsibility on the negligent officials. 
It may be mentioned that Pakistan made a payment of $28.706 million to the British firm, Broadsheet LLC, after losing the long-running litigation in the London High Court. 
The amount was transferred from the Pakistan High Commission on behalf of NAB to the assets recovery firm — 21 years after it was hired to trace the alleged foreign assets of dozens of Pakistanis which it failed to find. 
Broadsheet, which was owned by Iranian-born former Oxford University academic Kaveh Moussavi since the mid-2000s, now stands liquidated.  
Moussavi, who was not initially involved with the company when it entered into an agreement with the Musharraf government, later funded the arbitration.  
He also served a year-long prison sentence in England for contempt of court in unrelated proceedings. 
Broadsheet maintains that it was created as a company specialising in the recovery of assets and funds, and was therefore engaged to trace, locate and transfer such items back to the state. 
In December 2018, former English court of appeal judge Sir Anthony Evans QC, as sole arbitrator, issued an order for payment of $22m to Broadsheet by the Pakistani government. 
In July 2019, the government appealed the arbitration, but was unsuccessful in its bid. 
The arbitrator found that Pakistan and NAB had wrongfully repudiated an asset recovery agreement with Broadsheet and ruled that the company was entitled to damages. 
Since then, the asset recovery firm has attempted to secure the payment for its services by targeting several entities in the UK with purported links to the Pakistani government. 
Broadsheet laid a claim to four Avenfield flats, though the claim was later discharged by the court. Broadsheet LLC also wrote to the Pakistani government and threatened to “seize the assets of the Pakistani cricket team” to recover the outstanding funds owed by anti-graft watchdog.

1,Modi backs down on farm reforms in victory for protesters,"GHAZIABAD: In a surprise announcement on Friday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he would repeal ...","GHAZIABAD: In a surprise announcement on Friday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he would repeal agriculture laws that farmers have been protesting against for more than a year, sparking celebrations for what farmers called a hard-fought victory. 
Modi’s decision is a significant climb-down for the combative leader and comes as state elections in politically important grain-belt states loom. 
The legislation — three laws introduced in September last year — was aimed at deregulating the sector, allowing farmers to sell produce to buyers beyond government-regulated wholesale markets where growers are assured of a minimum price. 
Farmers, fearing the reform would cut the prices they get for their crops, staged nationwide protests that drew in activists and celebrities from India and beyond, including climate activist Greta Thunberg and pop singer Rihanna. 
“Today I have come to tell you, the whole country, that we have decided to withdraw all three agricultural laws,” Modi said in an address to the nation. 
“I urge farmers to return to their homes, their farms and their families, and I also request them to start afresh.”  The government would repeal the laws in the new session of parliament, starting this month, he said. 
The concession on laws the government had said were essential to tackle chronic wastage and inefficiencies comes ahead of elections early next year in Uttar Pradesh (UP), India’s most populous state and long a key political battleground, and two other northern states with large rural populations. 
Modi’s capitulation leaves unresolved a complex system of farm subsidies and price supports that critics say the government cannot afford. It could also raise questions for potential investors. 
Protesting farmers, who have been camped out in their thousands by main roads around the capital, New Delhi, celebrated Modi’s back-track. 
“Despite a lot of difficulties, we have been here for nearly a year and today our sacrifice finally paid off,” said Ranjit Kumar, a 36-year-old farmer at Ghazipur, a major protest site in Uttar Pradesh. 
Jubilant farmers handed out sweets in celebration and chanted “hail the farmer” and “long live farmers’ movement”. 
Rakesh Tikait, a farmers’ group leader, said the protests would only be called off when parliament repealed the laws. 
Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government said last year there was no question of repealing the laws. It attempted to break the impasse by offering to water down the legislation but protracted negotiations failed.

2,Deforestation in Amazon up by 22pc in 12 months,Environment minister insists data “does not exactly reflect the situation in the last few months”.,"BRASLIA: Deforestation in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest rose by almost 22 per cent in one year, the highest level in 15 years, according to figures released on Thursday that cast doubt on promises by President Jair Bolsonaro’s government to reverse the trend with “forceful” action. 
The 13,235 square kilometres of forest lost from August 2020 to July 2021 period was the largest swath since 14,286sq-kms were cleared in 2005-06, according to an estimate by Brazil’s national space research institute INPE. 
It is the third time in a row that annual Amazon deforestation has increased under Bolsonaro, whom the opposition blames for the spike due to his encouraging of farming and mining activity. 
Environment Minister Joaquim Leite admitted the figures represented “a challenge” and vowed to be “more forceful against environmental crimes”. He also insisted the data “does not exactly reflect the situation in the last few months”. 
However, last week INPE said it had registered the worst October on record for deforestation, with an area more than half the size of the city of Rio de Janeiro cleared. 
The government says it has intensified its attempts to combat illegal deforestation by deploying more troops on the ground. 
“To those who still insist on these environmental crimes, [we warn] that the Brazilian state will enter the Amazon with full force,” said the Minister of Justice and Public Security Anderson Torres. 
Brazil was among the signatories to an international pledge made at the COP26 summit in Glasgow to end deforestation by 2030. 
Bolsonaro went even further by pledging to eliminate illegal deforestation in the giant South American country — home to 60pc of the Amazon — by 2028, pulling forward a previous target by two years. 
The far-right president came to power in January 2019 with a strong anti-environmentalist message and has been accused by NGOs, indigenous groups and the political opposition of weakening environmental safeguards. 
Between August 2018 and July 2019, 10,129sq-kms of the Amazon were cleared, a spike of 34pc over the same period in the previous year, according to INPE. 
In the following period, from 2019-2020, 10,851sq-kms were lost, an increase of seven per cent, despite the deployment of costly military operations to the jungle to confront illegal loggers, miners and ranchers during the most intense periods of Amazon deforestation and fires.

3,"Austria to impose partial lockdown, mandatory jabs",VIENNA: Austria on Friday became the first EU country to announce it would make coronavirus vaccinations mandatory...,"VIENNA: Austria on Friday became the first EU country to announce it would make coronavirus vaccinations mandatory and will next week impose a partial lockdown in the face of spiralling infections. 
The lockdown, which comes into effect on Monday, constitutes the toughest restrictions introduced in Europe in recent weeks as Covid-19 cases surge continent-wide, fuelled by vaccine resistance. 
Austrians will not be allowed to leave home except to go to work, shop for essentials and exercise. The restrictions will initially last 20 days with an evaluation after 10 days, Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said. 
Schools will remain open, although parents have been asked to keep their children at home if possible. Working from home is also recommended. 
Vaccination against Covid-19 in the Alpine nation will be mandatory from February 1 next year, Schallenberg said. So far, the Vatican alone in Europe has imposed a vaccination mandate. 
“Despite months of persuasion, we have not succeeded in convincing enough people to get vaccinated,” Schallenberg told a press conference, calling vaccinations the only “exit ticket” out of the pandemic. 
Austria has already imposed movement restrictions on those not vaccinated or recently recovered from the virus, ordering them to stay at home since Monday, becoming the first EU country to do so. 
But infections have continued to rise. On Friday, a new record of more than 15,800 new cases was recorded in the EU member of nearly nine million people. 
“I was hoping that there wouldn’t be a general lockdown,” said Markus Horvath as he prepared to shut from Monday his stall selling wooden jewellery at a Christmas market in Vienna. 
Christian Edlmayr, selling glass ornaments at another Vienna Christmas market, said he would lose half his yearly revenue. “This will be very, very bad for me,” he said. 
Under the partial lockdown, only outlets deemed essential will remain open such as supermarkets, banks, pharmacies and post offices.

4,Millions enthralled by longest partial lunar eclipse since 1440,"There will be a longer total lunar eclipse on November 8 next year, according to Nasa.","LOS ANGELES: The longest partial lunar eclipse in nearly 600 years, which bathed the Moon in red, was visible for a big slice of humanity on Friday. 
The celestial show saw the lunar disc almost completely cast in shadow as it moved behind the Earth, reddening 99 per cent of its face. 
The spectacle was visible for all of North America and parts of South America from 0602 GMT on Friday, and was later seen in Australia and northeast Asia. 
By 0750 GMT, sky-watchers with a cloud-free view in those regions saw the Moon half covered by the Earth’s penumbra — the outer shadow. 
Space scientists said on Thursday that by 0845 GMT the Moon would appear red, with the most vivid colouring visible at peak eclipse 18 minutes later. 
The dramatic red is caused by a phenomenon known as “Rayleigh scattering”, where the shorter blue light-waves from the Sun are dispersed by particles in the Earth’s atmosphere. Red light-waves, which are longer, pass easily through these particles. 
“The more dust or clouds in Earth’s atmosphere during the eclipse, the redder the Moon will appear,” a NASA website explained. “It’s as if all the world’s sunrises and sunsets are projected onto the Moon.” 
From the moment the eclipse began — when the Moon entered the Earth’s shadow — to when it ended took more than three hours and 28 minutes. 
That is the longest partial eclipse since 1440 — around the time Johannes Gutenberg invented his printing press — and won’t be beaten until the far-off future of 2669. 
But Moon watchers won’t have to wait that long for another show — there will be a longer total lunar eclipse on November 8 next year, according to NASA. 
Even better news for anyone wanting to watch was that no special equipment was necessary, unlike for solar eclipses. Binoculars, telescopes or the naked eye gave a decent view of the spectacle — as long as there was good weather.
