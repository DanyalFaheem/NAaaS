0,Weekly inflation sees sixth consecutive increase,SPI driven by sharp rise in prices of essential food items.,"ISLAMABAD: Inflation measured through the Sensitive Price Index (SPI) posted an increase of 1.07 per cent for the week ended on November 18 driven by a sharp rise in the prices of essential food items, data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) showed on Friday. 
The PBS data showed that this is the sixth consecutive week where inflation witnessed an upward increase. In November, the highest jump of 1.81pc in weekly inflation was recorded. 
For the lowest income group earning below Rs17,732 per month, the SPI increased by 0.39pc. For the group earning above Rs44,175, it rose by 1.44pc. 

SPI driven by sharp rise in prices of essential food items

This was mainly due to an increase in prices of essential items including chicken 8.26pc, cooking oil 5 litre 4.72pc, bananas 4.18pc, washing soap 3.94pc, vegetable ghee 2.5 kg 3.15pc, vegetable ghee 1 kg 2.38pc, rice irri 1.76pc, pulse moong 1.62pc, eggs 1.52pc, fire wood 1.24pc and tea prepared 1.21pc. 
The items whose prices decreased during the week included tomatoes 5.77pc, sugar 4.25pc, onions 2.14pc, gur 1.48pc, potatoes 1.36pc, pulse masoor 0.43pc, garlic 0.13pc, wheat flour 0.08pc, LPG 0.08pc and pulse gram 0.02pc. 
During the week, out of 51 items, prices of 27 items incr­eased 10 items decreased and 14 items remained constant.
Analyst Fahad Rauf at Ismail Iqbal Securities said SPI has remained above one per cent level for the past four out of five weeks, which is not a usual phenomenon. 
“It indicates a sharp rise in Consumer Price Index (CPI) in coming months,” he said, adding that the headline inflation would reach 10.3pc this month.
He believed that commodity prices would remain under pressure during January to March 2022 in view of rising transportation cost on account of soaring diesel prices in the last few months, the impact of rupee’s devaluation of over 13pc against the dollar since July, and high energy prices.

1,"Profit margins of petroleum dealers, OMCs may be deregulated",They have been seeking increase in their sales and distribution margins by around 50pc.,"ISLAMABAD: The government is considering complete deregulation of profit margins of petroleum dealers and oil marketing companies (OMCs) with upper caps and initial increase of 15-20 per cent.  
This is based on the advice of state-owned Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (Pide) but a final decision is expected to be taken by the Cabinet Committee on Energy (CCOE) or the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet next week. 
The OMCs and petroleum dealers have been seeking increase in their sales and distribution margins by around 50pc to the premise of increase in the costs of doing business and inflation. 
The dealers had threatened to go on countrywide strike with effect from November 5 in protest against the government’s dilly-dallying on increase in their margins. On November 3, they withdrew their protest strike call after a government team led by Minister for Energy Hammad Azhar agreed to increase their margins on sale of petroleum products by 6pc within a few days. The meeting had also constituted a committee led by Petroleum Secretary Dr Arshad Mahmood and comprising stakeholders to ensure implementation of the agreement for increase in the margins through approvals from the ECC and the federal cabinet by November 15. The government team also included the chairman of the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) and the Director General Oil. 
The dealers announced on November 3 that they were calling off their protest but would go on a strike from November 20 if agreed increase in margins was not notified.
Informed sources said that about 15-20pc increase in dealers’ margins and OMC’s commission had been finalised in a summary to the cabinet committees. The summary had proposed increasing dealers commission by about 85 paisa and 60 paisa per litre on petrol and diesel respectively and about 60 paisa per litre increase for both petrol and diesel for OMCs. At present, the OMCs are allowed Rs2.97 per litre commission on both products and dealers get Rs3.90 and Rs3.30 per litre on petrol and diesel, respectively. 
The summary was held back at the last moment on the receipt of an independent study submitted by Pide. The study proposed deregulation of margins for dealers and OMCs with an upper cap at about Rs4 and Rs4.50 per litre, respectively or as percentage of sale price of petroleum products, starting with the same range of impact. 
Pide advised that best option would be complete deregulation for which the current market situation was the most opportune as various cost elements were fixed and enough players were in the market for fair competition. At the same time, Pide also called for facilitation of a fresh category of petroleum dealers alongside two existing categories for competition but did not suggest if regulatory environment was conducive. At present, retain pumps are of two categories including “company owned and company operated” and “company owned, dealer operated”. The new category should be of “dealer owned, dealer operated” on the pattern of the United States and the Philippines. 
It said country had 66 licences OMCs and 34 of them were actively operating in the market – an ideal situation for competition. On top, there were about 10,000 petroleum pumps – one third of whom belonged to state-run Pakistan State Oil which can act as price leader with overall market share of close to 50pc. 
Since, the ex-refinery or import parity price was well known along with federal excise, customs duty, inland freight equalisation margin, petroleum levy and sales tax, the margins for OMCs and dealers could be ascertained by Ogra in case these go beyond upper cap. 
It also offered another option of partial deregulation with upper cap of margins either by merging margins both the dealers and OMCs or without merger. The upper cap could be in the shape of fixed margin or up to 13pc on total capital employed on arranging product supply which worked out to be 6.5pc to 7pc of sale price of petroleum products. At this rate, per litre margins ranged between Rs7 and 8 per litre each to dealers and OMCs on both products. This also involved the cost for maintaining mandatory stocks.

2,"Punjab faces  fertiliser shortage, centre told",ISLAMABAD: Minis­ter for National Food Security and Research Syed Fakhr Imam on Friday presided over a meeting of...,"ISLAMABAD: Minis­ter for National Food Security and Research Syed Fakhr Imam on Friday presided over a meeting of provincial counterparts to monitor the ongoing sowing of wheat in the country. 
Punjab Minister for Agriculture Hussain Jahania Gardezi informed the meeting that his province was facing shortage of fertiliser. 
Mr Imam said immediate steps would be taken to ensure that all that’s needed for production are available in ample supply. 
He said the federal government in the meantime has no worries about the availability of urea as the gas companies have been directed to streamline supply of gas to the fertiliser plants for smooth production of fertiliser. 
A recent meeting on fertiliser held at the finance ministry was informed that the supply of gas to SNGPL-based urea plants will assure production of additional 300,000 tonnes of fertiliser till January 2022. At the same time, tender for import of 100,000 tonnes of urea has also been floated, the meeting was informed. 
Mr Imam praised the efforts of Punjab agriculture minister in ensuring that the farmers sow wheat seeds timely. 
The Punjab minister informed the meeting that the provincial government has conducted numerous seminars to create awareness in addition with partnering with five agricultural universities to mobilise agricultural students in ensuring proper sowing of wheat seeds. 
The meeting was inf­o­r­med that 51 per cent of wheat sowing in Pun­jab, 42pc in Sindh and 40pc each in Khyber Pakh­­tunkhwa and Balo­chistan has been completed.
Mr Imam told the prov­incial representatives that the purpose of the meeting was to ensure that “we are on track to meet the assigned wheat targets”. 
The government has fixed wheat production target of 28.9 million tonnes from a sowing area of 9.2m hectares for the Rabi season 2021-22. 
During the meeting, the federal minister discussed the outstanding issues that the provincial agriculture departments are facing in order to meet the assigned targets. 
Mr Imam was briefed that the certified seed of wheat is sufficiently available with all provinces. He, however, emphasised that a ‘track and trace system’ is established to ensure maximum productivity of wheat in the country.

3,Egypt to import meat from Pakistan,Commerce adviser says move is a part of the government’s policy of geographical and product diversification.,"ISLAMABAD: Egypt has approved 10 slaughter houses of Pakistani companies for import of meat. 
An official announcement of the commerce ministry said that Egypt’s Veterinary Quarantine Department had given approval to these Pakistani slaughter houses for export of meat to Egypt.

4,Underutilised cement plants likely to pay more tax,Units going to raise output may be exempted.,"KARACHI: The government plans to impose a higher tax rate on underutilised cement plants, according to Muzzam­mil Aslam, spokesperson for the Ministry of Finance. 
“The government is considering a revision in tax rates related to capacity utilisation to bring down the price of cement. Those who increase production will be exempted from it,” he tweeted on Friday while noting that the ministry will soon send a summary to the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC). 

 



 
Speaking to Dawn, Mr Aslam said cement-makers are keeping the retail price at an elevated level by controlling the industry output. “They go to court and get stay orders when the Competition Commission of Pakistan takes action against them,” he said. 

Units going to raise output may be exempted

At the end of the last fiscal year, the country’s cement-making capacity was 69.3 million tonnes. The industry used almost 84 per cent of its available capacity to produce cement.
“Underutilised plants will have to pay a higher federal excise duty (FED). The ECC will decide the extent of the increase in its rate,” he added. 
The industry currently pays the FED of Rs1,500 per tonne or Rs1.50 per kilogram of its output. 
According to AKD Securities research analyst Shahrukh Saleem, local cement despatches dropped 5pc in October from a year ago but increased 15pc on a month-on-month basis. “Overall, we expect the local demand to remain strong for 2021-22 as economic activity continues to pick up.” 
As for raising the FED rate at a time when input costs are on the higher side and the exchange rate is volatile, Mr Aslam said plants that are sufficiently utilising their production capacities won’t get affected by the proposed tax hike. 
“Who should we protect: consumers or cement makers? Isn’t it harmful for the country that they’ve joined hands and set a higher market price?” he said. The industry-wide capacity has grown at an annualised rate of 8.6pc in the last five years. The level of capacity utilisation has been in the range of 74pc and 91pc during these years. 
Speaking to Dawn, Arif Habib Ltd Head of Research Tahir Abbas said determining its optimum level of production is every company’s prerogative. “I don’t think the government will collect a lot of revenue by increasing the tax rate on underutilised plants. The government’s focus should be on promoting the free-market economy rather than introducing price-setting mechanisms,” he said. 
Mr Abbas insisted that rising raw material prices and depreciation have mainly been contributing to the 15-20pc increase in the retail price of cement during the preceding 12 months. 
Many cement-makers, including Lucky, Attock, D G Khan, Bestway, Fauji, Flying, Cherat, Kohat and Maple Leaf have already announced capacity expansion plans, according to data compiled by BR Research. These companies will add a total capacity of 30m tonnes and bring the industry-wide output potential to 100m tonnes by 2024-25, it said. 
“Utilisation levels come down after every round of capacity expansion as the base gets bigger. The government should realise that a variety of factors, including seasonality, drives capacity utilisation,” said Mr Abbas.

5,LCCI condemns increase in discount rate,LAHORE: The Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) on Friday said the State Bank of Pak­istan’s (SBP)...,"LAHORE: The Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) on Friday said the State Bank of Pak­istan’s (SBP) latest move is totally against the business community’s expectations as the stage has been set for cost-push inflation. 
“Increasing the discount rate by 150 basis points would correspondingly jack up the cost of doing business that would ultimately hit the economic growth that has just started showing signs of recovery,” a joint statement issued by LCCI president Mian Nauman Kabir, senior vice president Mian Rehman Aziz Chan and vice president Haris Ateeq said.  
The LCCI office-bearers said the SBP’s decision would not help curtail fiscal deficit nor control inflation as it had not served the purpose in the past and instead would create trouble for new investors. They said that at this point in time when both the trade and industry were in dire need of some special package, the increase in interest rate will prove only counterproductive to economic recovery.
“The cost of doing business in Pakistan is already the highest in the region. The business community has been demanding lowering of interest rate for the sake of new investments that are going down with every passing day,” the LCCI representatives said.  
“Pakistani businessmen need cheaper money as on the one hand it would facilitate him while on the other it would help ensure economic growth, which is at the moment much below the target. The SBP should focus on reducing the banking spread to control inflation instead of jacking up the discount rate by 150 basis points,” the LCCI statement added.

6,Remittances to remain flat in 2022: World Bank,"Govt’s proactive ‘Pakistan Remittance Initiative’ was successful in attracting large inflows in 2021, notes report.","ISLAMABAD: Remittances in Pakistan are likely to remain flat at the presently high levels in 2022 as the one-off effect of government incentives to attract them fades, says a new World Bank report. 
The latest issue of ‘Migration and Development Brief’ says Pakistan had another year of record remittances with growth at 26 per cent, and levels reaching $33 billion in 2021. 
In addition to the common drivers, the government’s proactive ‘Pakistan Remittance Initiative’ to support the transmission of remittances through formal channels was successful in attracting large inflows in 2021. 
The report which focused recovery from Covid-19 crisis through a migration lens, says Afghanistan’s fragile economic and political situation emerged as an unexpected prompt of remittance inflows into Pakistan in 2021. 
Afghanistan’s fragile economic and political situation gave a special impetus to remittance inflows in Pakistan. Following the breakdown of official channels of money transfers to Afghanistan, remittances intended for Afghan refugees in Pakistan, as well as for families in dire stress in Afghanistan, flowed into Pakistan. According to one report, about 50,000 Afghans crossed the border into Pakistan and Iran some weeks before Pakistan temporarily closed its borders. 
Although South Asia still has the lowest average remittance costs of any world region, at 4.6pc, the cost of remitting money to South Asia through official channels is high, and informal channels remain popular. 
The report says the remittance outlook for South Asia in 2022 is uncertain. On the positive side, forecasts of a robust recovery in the US offer good news for India but will benefit other South Asian countries less as they have fewer skilled migrants there.
