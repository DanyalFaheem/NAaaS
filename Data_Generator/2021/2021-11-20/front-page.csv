0,Indian contempt move in Kulbhushan Jadhav case averted: govt,Law minister Naseem Farogh says ICJ bill passed recently is not person-specific.,"ISLAMABAD: Federal Minis­ter for Law and Justice Barrister Dr Farogh Naseem has said that the government has averted the Indian move to file a contempt petition before the International Court of Justice against Pakistan for non-compliance with the ICJ decision on Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav.  
Addressing a press conference on Friday, he said the bill passed by the joint sitting of parliament and related to Jadhav was not person-specific rather it was a national security issue.  
The parliament had passed the International Court of Justice (Review and Reconsideration) Bill, 2021 on Wednesday to provide for the right of review and reconsideration in the Jadhav case in line with the judgement of the ICJ.  
“This was the red line for Pakistan. India would have gone to the ICJ and filed a contempt case against us if we have not enacted this law,” the law minister said.  

Farogh says ICJ bill passed recently is not person-specific      

He said that Pakistan had prevented India from filing a contempt case which was called defiance in the ICJ, adding that India could have moved the United Nations Security Council for imposing sanctions on Pakistan.  
Mr Naseem criticised the opposition parties for politicising the issue and said they lacked vision to differentiate between right and wrong.  
Anti-rape law
Meanwhile, parliamentary secretary for law and justice Maleeka Bukhari, who also spoke at the presser, congratulated the nation on the adoption of the landmark anti-rape legislation by the parliament.  
However, she said that the proposal of chemical castration of sex offenders had been dropped in the criminal law amendments after the Council of Islamic Ideology declared it against Islamic injunctions, adding that the constitution barred any un-Islamic legislation.  
She lamented the lowest conviction rate of sex offenders saying that it was about one or two per cent. Besides other issues, she explained, out of court settlement in rape cases was a major reason for the lowest conviction and higher acquittal rate. Ms Bukhari expressed hope that the new legislation would discourage out of court settlement.   
She said that the law had abolished unnecessary procedures, making it simple for a rape victim to proceed against the offender.  
She further said that the legislation also provided for registration of sex offenders and the National Database and Regis­tration Authority would make arrangements for this purpose.

1,Four govt bills passed in stormy Senate session,Opposition piqued by last-minute presentation of two bills through supplementary agenda.,"ISLAMABAD: Torn-up copies of the agenda flew in the Senate on Friday as four government bills were passed by the otherwise opposition-dominated house.  
The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) Amendment Bill, Protection of Journalists and Media Professionals Bill, Higher Education Commission (HEC) (Amendment) Bill and HEC Second Amendment Bill were passed without being referred to the standing committees concerned amid the opposition’s protest.  
The last-minute landing of two of these bills through supplementary agenda was particularly slammed by the opposition, prompting Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani to observe that the opposition had fallen into the habit of blaming him whenever it suffered a defeat on account of its own failure to bring its members to the house.  
He insisted that the decision on taking up a bill for “consideration at once” had to be taken by the house and he had no role to play in this process.  

Opposition piqued by last-minute presentation of two bills through supplementary agenda

The protesting opposition lawmakers assembled near the chairman’s podium tearing up copies of the supplementary agenda and hurling them at the chair. Former chairman of Senate Mian Raza Rabbani held an argument with the chair over taking up the bills directly for voting. “Do not tell me this please. It has frequently happened in the past as well,” Mr Sanjrani told Mr Rabbani. “You did it a million times during your days as chairman.”  
A highlight of the day was criticism of the chair from both sides of the aisle.   
Earlier, several bills introduced in the house — including some concerning human rights — were referred to the standing committees concerned, despite insistence of the treasury benches that these contained minor procedural changes and be taken into consideration at once and passed.  
“It appears as if you (Sanjrani) are chairman of the opposition only” Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Mohammad Khan said.  
He said all decisions were being taken as per wishes of the opposition and the bills requiring immediate consideration of the house were also being referred to the standing committees.  
The chairman said he had equal respect for members from both the sides and advised the minister of state not to target the chair.  
Leader of the House Dr Shehzad Waseem said the opposition claimed to respect the chairman but their respect was selective.  
“They are respectful when the decision is in their favour, but term all things won through a majority ‘bulldozing’,” he remarked.  
But the scene shortly changed when the government sensing thin presence of the opposition insisted on voting to decide whether the HEC amendment bill should be taken up for consideration.  
The house allowed immediate consideration with a 34-28 majority vote and subsequently the two bills seeking to amend the HEC act were passed.  
Before moving the second bill, Ali Mohammad Khan disclosed that supplementary agenda was also there.  
The presentation of supplementary agenda sparked uproar in the house.  
Upon receiving copies of the agenda, members of the opposition ripped them apart and flung them towards Mr Sanjrani.  
Under the amendment to the NAB ordinance, the prosecutor general accountability will hold office for three years and will be eligible for re-appointment for a similar term or terms.  
The journalists and media workers’ protection bill is meant to promote, protect and effectively ensure independence, impartiality, safety and freedom of expression of journalists and media professionals.  
Both the bills were passed by a 35-29 majority vote. A six-member group led by Senator Dilawar Khan also voted in the government’s favour.  
Talking to reporters later, Parliamentary Leader of the PPP in the Senate Sherry Rehman regretted that instead of sending bills to committee as per the norm, the government introduced a 
“sneaky” supplementary agenda right before Friday prayers.  
She said it was clearly pre-planned and in direct contradiction to the assurances given to the leader of oppositions office that all bills would be tabled as per the agenda and that they would go to standing committees.  
She said the treasury introduced a supplementary agenda at 12.35pm, without laying bills, and summoned members they had kept back to bulldoze a person-specific HEC bill and then introduced the NAB bill, despite absence of certain members due to Friday prayers.  
Clearly pointing fingers at the chairman, she said the pre-planned and malicious move went against all parliamentary norms according to which business was conducted in the house.  
“It is clear that by attacking the Senate the government is not ready to allow the provinces to speak and breathe, nor is it giving us the right to ask questions about Pakistan’s sovereignty, whether it is about the IMF or amnesty agreements. We are not allowed to question the government’s position on issues which have significant consequences for the future of our country,” she said. “Sindh is being marginalised and its grievances are not being addressed. The government is evading its responsibilities as they are unwilling to hear us on vital issues of the census, water or any resource shared among the provinces. What is happening in the National Assembly and during joint sessions is worse than the kind of ‘martial law assemblies’ we have seen”.  
Ms Rehman said: “They are trying to make the Senate ineffective. The bills bulldozed today were not even circulated among the members. Even the IMF has asked for bills to be passed, and is no more accepting legislation passed through ordinances. Unfortunately, this is the only way this government knows how to govern the country. Their mala fide intent is obvious by how they tried to convert the opposition’s majority into minority but we will fight back on the floor of the Senate.”   
She said the government was bulldozing bills in the Senate and was trying to bring the National Assembly’s chaos here. She rejected what she called the treasury’s artificial majority.  
“We will not let them pass bills without consultations, especially the bill regarding the State Bank’s autonomy,” she said.

2,PM Imran asks provinces to get land data verified in two months,Mapping work on 88pc of government lands has been completed.,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Friday instructed the provinces to complete with help of the Survey of Pakistan department verification of mapping data within two months to get state land rid of illegal occupation.  
Provinces were also urged to complete the legislative process against encroachments on public land at the earliest.  
Prime Minister Khan issued the instructions while presiding over a meeting of the National Coordinating Committee for Housing, Construction and Development.  He ordered an effective follow-up of pending cases against encroachments by provincial governments and the Islamabad Capital Territory and called for carrying out plantation on the land rid of encroachments.  
The Surveyor General of Pakistan gave a detailed briefing on cadastral mapping (maps showing ownership of land) in the country.  
The meeting was informed that mapping work on 88 per cent of government lands had been completed, which had revealed that thousands of acres worth trillions had been encroached upon. It was also told that cadastral mapping would help digitalise the ownership of government lands.  
Most of the encroachments have been made on forest lands, in addition to those of Wapda, the National Highway Authority, the Civil Aviation Authority and Pakistan Railways.  
The meeting was told that in the next phase of the project, the process of digitalisation of private lands would be completed with the help of provincial governments.

Housing project
Prime Minister Khan also visited the site of over 4,000 under-construction housing units being built under the Naya Pakistan Housing Project.  
During the visit, he said it was for the first time that people who could not afford their own houses could now own them. “No government in the past cared for the low-income segments of society, who had no shelter,” he said during his visit to Farash Town, in the suburbs of Islamabad.  
A total of 4,400 apartments are being constructed there in collaboration with the Capital Development Authority, Naya Pakistan Housing and Development Authority (NPHDA) and Frontier Works Organisation. Mr Khan had performed the ground-breaking of the project in April this year.  
The 4,400 apartments are being constructed on 70 kanals of land and out of them 2,000 units have been reserved for low-income groups registered under the Naya Pakistan Housing, 400 for slum dwellers and 2,000 for middle-income and salaried people. The project will cost Rs15.3 billion.  
In his address on the occasion, the prime minister said his government, besides building the housing units, was also providing a subsidy of Rs300,000 for each house and providing loans at a very small markup. “A sum of Rs30bn has been allocated for this purpose,” he added.  
Mr Khan said that banks had applications amounting to around Rs226bn under processing, while those working out to a total of Rs90bn had already been approved.  
Currently 100,000 houses were under construction, he said, adding that it took almost two years to put in place a structure that could take up the difficult task.  
However, the NPHDA was fully functional now to plan and execute projects involving low-cost housing.  
Chairing a separate meeting, Prime Minister Khan said the objective behind establishing the Rehmatul-lil-Alameen (PBUH) Authority was to eliminate moral evils and train children and youths to promote the teachings of Holy Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him).  
The meeting discussed the methodology for consultation with ulema about the authority’s proposed measures at the international level.

3,SBP lifts interest rate to 8.75pc,KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan raised the policy interest rate by 150 basis points...,"• Central bank surprises market by hiking policy rate by 150 basis points
• Says goal of ‘mildly positive real interest rates’ remains unchanged    
KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan raised the policy interest rate by 150 basis points to 8.75 per cent on Friday, as “the balance of risks has shifted away from growth and towards inflation and the current account faster than expected”. 
The central bank announced its monetary policy a week earlier than the scheduled date in an attempt to address the situation going out of control with higher inflation, rising current account deficit, disrupted exchange rate and negative real interest rate. The quantum of the hike also surprised the market.
The new policy interest rate is 8.75pc, close to October’s inflation of 9.2pc. 
Interest rates are used by the central bank to control inflation, regulate unnecessary movements in currency rates and guide the national economy. 
Since the last meeting held in September, “risks related to inflation and the balance of payments have increased,” the SBP said in a statement. 
With respect to the balance of payments, the current account deficits in September and October have been larger than anticipated, reflecting both rising oil and commodity prices and buoyant domestic demand, the bank said. “The burden of adjusting to these external pressures has largely fallen on the rupee.” 
Across the world, price pressures from Covid-induced disruptions to supply chains and higher energy prices are proving to be larger and longer-lasting than previously anticipated, it said. “In Pakistan, high import prices have contributed to higher-than-expected CPI [consumer price index], SPI [sensitive price indicator], and core inflation outturns.” 
The SBP stressed the need to proceed faster to normalise monetary policy to counter inflationary pressures and preserve stability with growth. “The interest rate increase is a material move in this direction,” it said. 
It said the end goal of mildly positive real interest rates remains unchanged and, given today’s move, expects to take measured steps to that end. 
The SBP said the economic recovery underway since the start of the 2020-21 fiscal year continues, as reflected in most high-frequency indicators of domestic demand  including automobile sales, POL (petroleum, oil and lubricants) sales, and electricity generation  as well as the strength of imports and tax revenues. 
The LSM registered a broad-based growth of 5.2pc year-on-year in the July-September quarter, led by production of consumer goods (both durable and non-durable), allied construction, and export industries, it added. 
“In agriculture, production levels of all major Kharif crops except cotton are estimated to have reached all-time highs,” said the SBP. 
The SBP said economic recovery appears increasingly durable and self-sustaining overall against the backdrop of rapidly falling Covid-19 cases and the government’s vigorous roll-out of the vaccination. 
Looking ahead, rising input costs and the normalization of macroeconomic policies are likely to lead to some moderation in the growth of industrial activity, it added. 
“This could be more than offset by the improved outlook for agriculture, such that risks to the growth forecast of 4-5pc in FY22 are tilted to the upside,” said the SBP. 
As a result of these developments, the balance of risks has shifted away from growth and towards inflation and the current account faster than expected, it added. 
There was also a moderate month-on-month decline in exports and remittances, it said adding that the current account deficit for FY22 is expected to modestly exceed the previous forecast of 2-3pc of GDP. The current account deficit has already exceeded the forecast as it reached 4.1pc in the first quarter of the current fiscal year. 
The SBP defended the market-based exchange rate and said it has played its due role as a shock absorber while it has borne a considerable burden in terms of adjusting to the widening current account deficit. 
“The fall in the value of the rupee since May has been comparatively large. As other adjustment tools normalize, including interest rates and fiscal policy, pressures on the rupee should abate,” the SBP said. 
The overall fiscal deficit improved to 0.8pc of GDP in the July-September quarter from 1pc in the same period a year ago but non-tax revenue fell by 22.6pc year-on-year due to a sharp decline in petroleum development levy collection. 
A higher-than-planned primary fiscal deficit would likely worsen the outlook for inflation and the current account, and would undermine the durability of the recovery, the central bank said. 
It added that the primary surplus was 28.6pc lower than in the first quarter of previous fiscal year due to a 33pc growth in non-interest spending. 
The SBP said that in the last two months inflation significantly increased by 2pc while the core inflation has also risen to 6.7pc in both urban and rural areas on the back of house rents, cloth and garments, medicines, footwear, and other components.

4,"UK, Pakistan finalise accord to repatriate illegal migrants","Unlike past practice, UK will now share data of people being repatriated.","ISLAMABAD: The federal government on Friday finalised negotiations on a bilateral readmissions agreement with the UK under which former prime minister Nawaz Sharif could also be repatriated for staying illegally in Britain. 
Earlier in August, Mr Sharif had filed an appeal with the British immigration tribunal after the country’s Home Department refused to extend his stay in the UK on medical grounds any further. 
To reach a new arrangement after Brexit, the permanent secretary of the UK’s Home Office, Matthew Rycroft, paid a two-day visit to Pakistan that was capped off on Thursday with finalisation of an agreement to tackle illegal migration. 
Mr Rycroft and Adviser to the Prime Minister on Interior and Accountability Shahzad Akbar finalised the negotiations on UK-Pakistan Readmissions Agreement, which would ensure the return of illegal migrants who had no lawful basis to remain in the country. 

Unlike past practice, UK will now share data of people being repatriated 

A statement issued by the British High Commission in Islamabad said it had been decided that the agreement would be presented to the Pakistani federal cabinet in the coming weeks to be implemented by the end of the year, subject to the cabinet’s approval. 
The agreement would enable the sharing of criminal records between the UK and Pakistani authorities to support effective law enforcement cooperation between the two countries. 
The high commission said the UK was committed to working with Pakistan to develop an effective partnership on migration as part of a deep and mutually beneficial relationship. 
During his visit, Mr Rycroft also spoke about the UK Home Office’s new immigration system that would level the global playing field to those wishing to travel to the UK. Pakistani students would benefit from new graduate routes providing them an opportunity to enter into skilled roles in the UK job market, the high commission said. 
Shahzad Akbar told Dawn that it took a year and a half of inter-ministerial meetings between the two countries to finalise the agreement. Previously, the British government did not share data and other records of people being repatriated to Pakistan. 
“Under the new agreement, the British authorities will share such information,” he added, citing an example of people charged with sexual offences and deported to Pakistan, with data of their offences and other critical information being shared with Pakistani authorities. 
Under the new agreement, those whose visas had expired, who had overstayed illegally and who were charged as sex offenders to mention some, would be repatriated to Pakistan and their details shared, the adviser explained. 
In December 2020, a chartered flight carrying Pakistani immigrants from London landed in Islamabad, nearly two months after it was refused permission at the last minute by the government on Oct 20.
