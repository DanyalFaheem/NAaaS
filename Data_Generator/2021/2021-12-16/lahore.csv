0,Smart water meters in city from January,"LAHORE: The Punjab government will start installation of 711,362 smart water meters for residential and commercial...","LAHORE: The Punjab government will start installation of 711,362 smart water meters for residential and commercial consumers in Lahore from the next month (January 2022).
The meters will be installed under public private partnership, covering 93 per cent residential and 7pc commercial consumers of the city. The meters would be installed by a company consortium at a cost of Rs11.22 billion.
According to officials, the meter installation would save the Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) officials from the hassle of going from door to door for reading as bills would be sent after electronic reading.
This was stated at a joint press conference held by Wasa Managing Director Syed Zahid Aziz and Punjab Public Private Partnership Authority Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Amjad Ali Awan at the authority’s office on Wednesday.
Mr Awan said the smart water metering project was launched to increase Wasa resources, adding that under the new arrangement the private companies would spend money, but the revenue would be shared with the agency.
“The private companies will also establish a factory to locally manufacture the meters and related tools,” he said, adding that the the project would also be replicated in other cities of the province as well after its launching in Lahore.
“Rs11.22 billion would be spent on the project and it would work under private partnership for 10 years and the private companies would also maintain and govern it,” he said, adding that after 10 years, Wasa would either take over the charge or the contract with the private partners would be extended.
“All the assets [of the project] would belong to Wasa and the consortium of the companies starting the project would have nothing to do with it,” he said.
Counting the financial benefits for the consumers after installation of the digital meters, Mr Aziz said presently the agency was sending bills based on the measurement of the consumers’ houses, but after meter installation they would be charged for the their water usage and no one would have to pay extra bill.
He said the new system would also help check water theft and wastage.
Earlier, the agency was sending 10,000 gallons bill to a three-marla house, 12,500 gallons to five-marla house, 15,000 gallons to 10-marla house and so on, but now the meter would record the exact water usage and the consumers would be charged accordingly.
He claimed the initiative would result in saving of Rs600 for a 20 to 40 marla house, Rs208 for 10 marla, Rs170 for 5 marla house and so on.
Replying to a query about the quality of water, he said meters installation would stop wastage of water and also maintain its quality as people would be conscious about any leakage and report it. It would also stop the practice of extracting more ground water and help maintain its level.
He said the system would also help the agency save 20 per cent in electricity bills and enable it to easily detect any theft.
Mr Aziz said the digital meters would work under automated process and connected to the main office, eliminating manual reading for billing.

2,Massive reshuffle a ‘welcome gift’ for new Islamabad IGP,LAHORE: The federal government made the massive reshuffle in the top hierarchy of police in the twin cities -...,"LAHORE: The federal government made the massive reshuffle in the top hierarchy of police in the twin cities - Islamabad and Rawalpindi – to build a new team for the newly-appointed Islamabad Inspector General of Police (IGP) Ahsan Yunous.
Almost entire top police team of Rawalpindi that was transferred to the federal capital comprised a group of officers who had earlier served under the new IGP of Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) when he was city police officer (CPO) there.
These officers include Rawalpindi operations SSP Rai Mazhar, Potohar SP Tassawar Iqbal, Rawal SP Zia Uddin Ahmad, Sadar SP Kamran Amir, Sadar circle Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Saud Khan and New Town ASP Benish Fatima.
The sudden transfer of such a large number of senior police officers from Rawalpindi to Islamabad has also perplexed new CPO Sajid Kiani as the district was among top crime zones in Punjab for high crime and law and order issues.
A senior officer privy to the development said all these transfers were made on the recommendations of the interior minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed on the request of Islamabad inspector general of police (IGP) who sought officers of his own choice to re-build his team for the federal capital.
He said the new IGP Ahsan Yunous had specially requested to the interior ministry to provide him officers from Rawalpindi region as he had served there as CPO.
The official said the federal interior minister was also instrumental in the appointment of Ahsan Yunous, a BS-20 officer, as Islamabad IGP. He added that both came close when Mr Yunous was the CPO of Rawalpindi, the city from where Sheikh Rashid had been getting elected as an MNA.
However, he said, the development was seen by police circles as a “rare model of policing” for the twin cities. They also apprehended that such reshuffles would create an impression of ‘grouping’ in police hierarchy that was earlier witnessed in the department around a decade ago in Punjab.
The official said such en bloc transfers from one city to another could also demoralise police officers already serving in the federal capital.
Apart from Rawalpindi, the federal government also transferred police officers from various parts of Punjab and other provinces to Islamabad, including BS-20 officer DIG Jahanzeb Nazir Khan who was serving in Special Branch, Punjab. Mr Nazir has been put at the disposal of the Interior Division for his posting in Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT). His transfer was made under the Rotation Policy 2020 for a period of two years from the date of his joining at the station outside the geographical boundaries of the Punjab government.
Similarly, BS-19 officer Mohammad Faisal, Gujranwala investigation SSP Syed Ali and BS-18 officer SP Dr Fahad have also been transferred from Punjab and their services have been placed at the disposal of the ICT for further posting.
Another BS-20 officer, Awais Ahmad, has been transferred from Gilgit-Baltitistan and placed at the disposal of the ICT police.
The more interesting part of the development is that 12 police officers, including the two DIGs, four SSPs and six SPs, have also been transferred from Islamabad to other provinces.
The official said the police circles term it another unusual practice, saying the transfer of so many senior officers from a city at once was “not a good omen” for the department. He said a section of the police community believed that Islamabad IGP was not feeling comfortable with these officers, while others were of the view that the transferred officers were avoiding to work under the new commander.
Of them, DIG rank BS-20 officer Mohammad Saleem was transferred from Islamabad to the National Highways & Motorway Police and DIG Waqar ud Din Syed was transferred and put at the disposal of the Gilgit Baltistan government. The official said both the DIGs were senior to the newly-appointed Islamabad IGP, who is from 28th Common Training Programme (CTP).
He said Mr Saleem belonged to 26th common, while Waqar ud Din, who was also from 28th common, had ‘inter se seniority’. So, he said, both officers were unwilling to serve under the command of their junior colleague in Islamabad, adding that they might have requested for their transfer from the federal capital.

A source in the LCWU told Dawn that the woman had tweeted about not receiving the degree before time and the administration had directed the security and faculty of social sciences to stop her from entering the university. However, the administration later forgot to exclude her name from the list, he said.
LCWU spokesperson Naveed Iqbal said no one had tried to stop the woman from entering the university.
In a tweet, which was later deleted, Dr Fauzia Imran said Mr Gill did not deserve to be a chief guest.

Mr Gill tweeted: “The woman did not come from home to receive the degree and she is the relative of PML-N leader Khwaja Saad Rafique.

9,LHC dismayed at political appointments of law officers,The court seeks the assistance of lawyers on SC judgments that enshrine recruitment on permanent posts after due process.,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has expressed concern over political appointments of the law officers in the office of the Advocate General of Punjab (AGP) and sought assistance of lawyers on the judgments of the Supreme Court that enshrine recruitment on permanent posts after a due process.
“The court’s concern is that appointments in the office of advocate general should not be politically motivated as is ordained by the Constitution in Article 17(2),” Justice Shahid Jamil Khan observes in a written order of a hearing on a petition challenging appointments of two additional advocate generals.
Advocate Noshab A. Khan argued on behalf of petitioner Afzal Azeem Pahat that respondents Umair Khan Niazi and Anees Hashmi were holding offices of the Insaf Lawyers Forum, the lawyers’ wing of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, at the time of their appointment as additional advocate generals on Dec 7, 2018.
Referring to a SC judgment, the counsel said the offices of the additional and assistant advocate generals fell in the definition of service of Pakistan under Article 240 of the Constitution. He said a person in service of Pakistan could not be a member of any such association or political party.
Representing the office of the AGP, Additional Advocate General Asif Bhatti told the court that as per his instructions the respondents had resigned from the offices of the ILF. However, he had not denied that at the time of appointment the respondents were holding the offices.
The law officer said the posts of assistant and additional advocate generals were pleasure posts. However, he had not denied that both offices were permanent and fell within the service of Pakistan.
The judge observes that it was not disputed that these posts were filled without any advertisement or competitive process for recruitment.
The law officer argued that being pleasure posts such requirements were not imperative.
Justice Khan would resume the hearing on Dec 22 when the petitioner’s counsel and the law officer would render their assistance on the judgments by the apex court on the matter. Notices have also been issued to the respondent law officers.

NAROWAL: Certain sections of Shakargarh-Narowal Road have been under sewage for 10 days due to the clogged main sewerage pipeline in Mohalla Antwali in Shakargarh.
Vehicles have to pass through one-foot deep sewage accumulated on the road while the sewage has also flooded several houses in the neighbourhood.
Residents allege the Shakargarh Municipal Committee and the Narowal district administration have failed to clear the choked sewers.
Locals Abrar Khan and Muhammad Nasir, who blocked the sewerage pipelines, said the Shakargarh Municipal Committee had been illegally dumping sewage on their land for many years.
They said two months ago, the assistant commissioner promised to get proper drainage of the sewage, but the administration failed to make any headway so far.
“We did not interfere in the administrative matters,” Abrar said, adding that he only laid mud on their land. He said that if Shakargarh-Narowal Road was under sewage, the district administration was responsible for the situation.
The stench emanating from the filthy water has made the life of the residents difficult.
Muhammad Afzal, in charge of the Shakargarh Services Municipal Committee, said the submerged part of the road belonged to the highways department, while the neighbourhood fell within the limits of the district council. He said Assistant Commissioner Zainul Abidin and the Municipal Committee staff were trying to restore the sewerage system.
Citizens demanded that Chief Minister Usman Buzdar get the sewerage system rehabilitated.

14,Impenetrable fog descends on Punjab earlier than expected,"According to the Environment Protection Agency data, Lahore’s air quality index rose up to 322 — a hazardous level.","LAHORE: As temperatures drop, a thick layer of fog descended on the province and the city, at least two weeks earlier (it started in the first week of January last year), dropped visibility to zero at some points and hit the entire travel network — air traffic, railways, highways and motorways.
According to meteorology department officials, the pattern would hold for the next few days as the temperature would drop even more as foggy conditions would persist and there are no chances of rain in central Punjab that can help clear conditions.
Worsened air pollution added to the problem. According to the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) data, Lahore’s air quality index rose up to 322 — a hazardous level, necessitating the use of face masks and advisory to avoid unnecessary exposure.
Other air quality measuring agencies, however, put it slightly higher at 348, with individual points registering even higher pollution; 525 at Aitchison College, 524 (DHA Phase-8), 415 (Fatehgarh) and 382 at Umer Block, Allama Iqbal Town. According to another estimate, Lahore was the most polluted city with AQI level of 369 on Wednesday.
Explaining the dichotomy, Amer Farooq of the EPA says few agencies measure pollution through a light-based system that confuses fog with smog.
The EPA measures it through a laser-based system that differentiates both and gives true picture of the pollution. “One must not forget that there are a few indicators if pollution crosses a threshold. Breathing issues in the elderly are one, and so is irritation in the eyes. Both are still missing.""


Vehicles drive with headlights as heavy fog reduces visibility in Lahore on Wednesday. — AP

 
He added that the EPA checked with the health officials, who said that the numbers of patients were still normal; ""there is no exceptional increasing, substantiating the EPA data instead of that of private agencies,” says Farooq.
“Till 2016, the province and the country had a set system of fog, which would start around Dec 20 and last till Jan 10,” says a meteorologist from the city. It changed in 2016, when fog came in the first week of December. For the next three years, it started in November and against shifted to January last year.""
This year, he continued, ""It is back to mid-December cycle. This changing pattern is a result of the climatic impact which is causing trouble for everyone. This foggy weather will now stay for few weeks.""
“In the last 24 hours, the authorities were forced to close Lahore-Sialkot, Lahore-Multan, Lahore-Islamabad and Lahore-Pindi Bhattian motorways,” says National Highways Authority spokesman Imran Shah.
On Wednesday, fog started even early and by 5pm, both Lahore-Multan and Lahore-Sialkot motorways were closed for traffic as visibility dropped to an alarming level. Patches of thick fog also impacted traffic on GT Road, slowing down the traffic to a snail’s pace, he says.
The Pakistan Railways escaped the impact by and large as only Awami Express got delayed by four hours on Wednesday. According to an official, even that delay was not caused by fog.
“However, there are a number of trains, which are moving slow and full impact of fog would be realised by tomorrow. Yesterday, fog came a little bit late on rail routes. But today, the onset was early and the railways might report more trains delayed,” he feared.

The petitioners said they had been denied the legitimate expectation to serve the public interest of their constituents, which was not only against the doctrine of democracy but also infringement of their fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 17 of the Constitution.
They asked the court to direct the government to issue a notification in respect of the period the petitioners remained out of their offices. They also urged the court to restrain the government from holding LG elections till expiry of the petitioner’s tenure.

Claiming that they had been raising the issue time and again with the Punjab chief secretary, food secretary and the cane commissioner’s office, the millers sought action against the middlemen and a ban on the transport of the sugarcane to Sindh arguing the shortage of the commodity in Punjab would lead to hike in cane prices in the province.
Mr Wattoo tells Dawn that he was 100 per cent sure that the mills in Punjab are purchasing sugarcane from the middlemen.
“In order to conceal this illegal purchase, the sugar mills are not providing the Cane Commissioner’s Office with grower-wise details of the purchase of sugarcane, despite clear-cut order under Rule 16(10) of the Sugar Factories (Control) Rules, 1950.”
By doing so, the sugar mills are defying the law and are challenging the writ of the state, he asserts. “Through such concealment of data, the growers are later denied payments of their dues and are embroiled in endless litigation.”
As regards the movement of sugarcane to the province of Sindh by the growers, Mr Wattoo says his office cannot ban it as the Constitution guarantees inter-provincial trade under Article 151.
The cane commissioner, however, said many sugar mills had refused to purchase certain sugarcane varieties despite the fact that the cane commissioner has not banned such varieties. Under the law, sugar mills cannot refuse such varieties which have not been banned by my office.
The acreage of such varieties is very large, particularly in Rahim Yar Khan. A simple question is where the growers should take their crop if the sugar mills in Punjab refuse to purchase it, he says.

20,Tareen rejects accusation of bearing Bani Gala expenses,LAHORE: Estranged PTI leader Jahangir Khan Tareen has rejected former party leader retired Justice Wajihuddin...,"LAHORE: Estranged PTI leader Jahangir Khan Tareen has rejected former party leader retired Justice Wajihuddin Ahmed’s accusation that he (Tareen) paid millions every month for Imran Khan’s household expenses.
“I have never paid a single penny for the household expenses of Bani Gala,” Tareen tweeted. “Whatever I did was in my capacity to help PTI build a new Pakistan.”
Justice Ahmed had told a private TV a couple of nights ago that Tareen initially gave Rs3 million per month for Khan’s household expenses, which was later increased to Rs5 million.
He said the “perception about Imran Khan being an honest man is completely wrong. How can you call him honest when he doesn’t pay even for his shoelaces?”
Ahmed who resigned from the PTI in 2016 had recommended the removal of Tareen and Pervez Khattak from the party on allegations of rigging during the intra-party election. However, Imran Khan expelled the former Sindh High Court judge from the party.
Responding to Tareen’s tweet, Justice Ahmed said the payment was made in cash as no record was maintained in such transactions. He said despite the sugar commission report, no action was taken against Tareen.
Speaking at a press conference Wednesday, Special Assistant to PM on Political Communication Shahbaz Gill hinted at issuance of a legal notice to Wajihuddin Ahmed by the party.
RAVI: Gill lauded Saudi Arabia’s $600 million investment in the Ravi City project, saying the new city will emerge as a construction master piece.
He was speaking to media following the signing of an agreement between a Saudi company and Ravi Urban Development Authority (RUDA) here. He said an environment-friendly industrial zone would be set up on 5,000 acres of land.
He said the Saudi company would construct 1,000 apartments, six schools and a large hospital. After 10 years, he said, all the constructed infrastructure would be transferred to the RUDA as a part of the agreement. He said these projects would also help strengthen the country’s economy.
RUDA Chairman Imran Amin said the project would be inaugurated in January 2022 and completed by a consortium, including the Saudi company. He also lauded the participation of Saudi investor Khalid Bin Abdul Aziz in the project and hoped that he would also be instrumental in bringing more Saudi industry to the Ravi City.
He said the project’s management would remain with the RUDA and added that its infrastructure, including schools and colleges would be completed in a year.
In the industrial zone, he said, the construction work would be completed in two years.
