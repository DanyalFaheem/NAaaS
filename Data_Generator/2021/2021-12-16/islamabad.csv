0,Private schools in Pindi to protest against eviction orders today,School owners warned not to bring students to agitation.,"RAWALPINDI: As Rawalpindi and Chaklala cantonment boards are all set to move educational institutions out of residential areas on the orders of the Supreme Court (SC) by Dec 30, representatives of private educational institutions will stage a protest on Thursday (today) against the decision.
On the other hand, the District Education Authority has warned private schools owners against dragging students into the protest.
In a letter to private schools and colleges in the cantonment areas, the authority said owners of private schools were bringing innocent students to their protest rallies, which was unethical and illegal.
“Strict action will be taken against the school management under section 12-A of the Punjab Private Educational Institution (Promotion and Regulation Ordinance 1984) if they are found involving students in the protest,” the letter said.

School owners warned not to bring students to agitation

Talking to Dawn, RCB spokesman Qaiser Mehmood said the cantonment board was implementing the court orders and would not allow anyone to violate the court’s directives.
He said private schools in the jurisdiction of cantonment’s residential areas had to be moved otherwise strict action would be taken as per the apex court’s orders, adding that all government organisations had to follow the directives.
Meanwhile, All Pakistan Private Schools and Colleges Association will stage protests at two places - one at Chur Chowk and the other in Chaklala Scheme-III. It has asked teachers, students and their parents to participate in the rallies.
The association’s Punjab chapter president, Ilyas Kiani, told Dawn that they had constituted administrative committees which would coordinate with teachers and parents for holding protests.
He said they would protest at Sir Syed Chowk and Chaklala Scheme III within the limits of Chaklala Cantonment Board and the road leading toward Rahmatabad would be closed.
He said the second protest demonstration would be held at Chur Chowk on Peshawar Road within the limits of Rawalpindi Cantonment Board.
He said the cantonment authorities were quick to issue eviction notices ‘under the guise of the Supreme Court’s decision’, which has caused anxiety among school owners, teachers and parents.
Mr Kiani urged Prime Minister Imran Khan and the chief justice of Pakistan to intervene as the future of four million students and 400,000 teachers and staff in 42 educational institutions in the cantonment boards hanged in balance.
Joint Action Committee of Private Educational Institutions Convener Ibrar Ahmed Khan told Dawn that apart from protest rallies, schools and colleges in the cantonment boards had also filed a plea with the Supreme Court and hoped that they would get a stay order.
He claimed that the private schools in cantonment boards were providing better education facilities to people at reasonable fees, adding that if private institutions were moved outside the residential areas, parents would suffer as they would have to arrange transport for their children, which would put extra burden on their budget.
He said teachers and school staff would also face problems if schools were shifted outside the residential areas, adding that private schools not only provided education but also employment to female teachers and staff near their homes.

1,Call to devise policies for protection of religious minorities,Alliance chairman says minorities will not tolerate any violation of the rights of minor girls.,"ISLAMABAD: The Minorities Alliance Pakistan (MAP) on Wednesday slammed forced conversions of underage girls through criminal means and demanded that the federal and provincial governments should devise uniform policies for protection of religious minorities.
Addressing a press conference at the National Press Club, MAP Chairman Akmal Bhatti said minorities would not tolerate any violation of the rights of minor girls.
The families of three rape victims were present at the press conference who highlighted their ordeal and hardships at the hands of various government departments and institutions while pursuing their cases.
Mr Bhatti said the government should set up special courts for such cases to provide speedy justice to victims, adding that every year in Pakistan around 1,000 minor girls were abducted, raped, forcibly converted and forced into marriages. He said it was not a religious issue but criminal-minded people, kidnappers and adulterers resort to religion only to escape punishment and the grip of law.
“Religious minorities are under stress and we protest these growing incidents,” Mr Bhatti said, adding that the voice of these girls cannot be silenced and the struggle to provide justice to them will continue. The families of the victims - Aina, Mehak and Arzoo Raja - called on authorities to award exemplary punishments to the culprits.
The MAP chairman also called on the president, prime minister and chief justice of Pakistan to punish perpetrators of abduction and rape of minors.
Speakers said the government should introduce legislation that would ban forced conversions and marriages.
The MAP leaders also regretted that the Ministry of Religious Affairs had stopped the proposed bill, the Prohibition of Forced Conversion Act 2021.
“It is unfortunate that the draft of the Prohibition of Forced Conversion Act 2021 prepared by the Ministry of Human Rights has been rejected by the parliamentary committee without any justification,” said Shamaun Alfred Gill, spokesman for the alliance.
“The minimum age of marriage in Sindh is 18 years and in Punjab it is 16 years, which can be interpreted to as low as 13 years. Yet, girls below the age of 18 years were kidnapped and forced into marriage in Sindh, while the law enforcement authorities remain silent,” Mr Gill added.

The meeting, chaired by Capital Development Authority (CDA) Chairman Amer Ali Ahmed, discussed the proposed land acquisition in old villages of Zone-III, however, after holding the initial discussion, the chair decided to meet again to discuss the issue further.
Islamabad is made up of five zones and Margalla Hills National Park (MHNP) area falls in Zone-III.
The CDA officials said this zone consisted of 50,398 acres out of which 19,992 acres were acquired land, 12,008 acres, forest land and state land and 18,398 acres is un-acquired and private land.
Shah Allah Ditta, Lakhwal, Banigala, Saidpur, Bhara Kahu (partially) Kot Hathial, Sangjani, some old villages and land within 2km radius of Rawal Dam is part of Zone-III.
“We are exploring options to acquire land of old villages that are located in Margalla Hills and in the national park area. Final decision will be taken in the next few days, but one thing is clear, we will not go for compulsory land acquisition, rather we will go for soft acquisition as people will be asked to sell their land to CDA on market rate whenever they want but they will not be allowed to sell it out to any private buyers,” said an officer who attended the meeting.
He said initially, the CDA was targeting old villages, like Gokina and Talhar, for acquisition.
The CDA has been announcing that it would acquire private land of this zone, but so far, no practical step was taken.
On the other hand, officials said if the CDA would go for acquisition of private land in Zone-III beyond the old villages, it will be a flop project as the civic body would have to pay billions of rupees against land and give thousands of plots against built-up property.
“Technically speaking, acquiring the entire private land in Zone-III is a cumbersome and complicated issue and we do not want to indulge ourselves in this controversy as we failed to acquire land of the planned H-13 sector,” the officer said, adding that instead of acquiring over 19,000 acres of private land in Zone-III, our target is old villages only.”
As far as the fate of the remaining area in Zone-III is concerned, the master plan commission should look into the issue, the officer said.
It is relevant to note here that under existing regulations of the CDA, owners of private land could not construct houses on their own land as the area falls in Zone-III.
Like, the private land in Zone-III, a sub-zone D of Zone-IV also falls in a similar category, where the CDA is neither acquiring land nor allowing people to construct houses.
According to CDA regulations, this sub zone, which comprises 23,618 acres of land is reserved for agro farming, nature conservation projects, sports and recreation, playgrounds, entertainment zones, apartments, office buildings and hotels.
However, in its latest meeting, the master plan commission realised the need for making changes in regulations of this sub zone.
“Various proposals are under consideration. The rationale behind the proposal of changing bylaws of this zone is to increase green cover and promote vertical construction,” said a member of the master plan commission, adding that options are also being explored to protect the landscape.

Stalls displaying various products including dresses were established. 
Chairman of the training council Tariq Mehmood said there wee limited job vacancies and instead of wasting time and energy, the youth should establish their own small enterprises and earn a living for not just their own families but also support others. 
“We want that instead of job seekers, they become job providers,” he added.
DC Sheikh said the fair was a great initiative and would serve as a platform to connect hundreds of young job-seekers with recruiters and HR professionals from leading enterprises.
“The skilled youth of any country play a vital role for economic development. Punjab Technical Education and Vocational Training Authority (Tevta) plays its key role in providing quality skills and job opportunities to youth,” he said, adding that it is hoped that there will be greater cooperation and collaboration between the council and the private sector towards enhancing the quality of training and employment opportunities for our graduates. 
He stressed the need for better academia and industry linkages. 
He mentioned that the role of programmes like Tevta is crucial in the socio-economic uplift of society especially the youth. While speaking to media, a number of students lauded the initiative and pointed out the need to organise similar events in far flung and remote towns of the country so that talented youth could get equal opportunities to prove themselves in different fields.

When contacted, IGP Ahsan Younas told Dawn that ideally cases should have been registered against 5,000 such complaints.
The purpose of tracing unattended complaints is to ascertain actual crime rate in the capital, he said, adding that in the light of actual crime situation, the police would be able to chalk out a strategy to counter criminals and criminal activities.
Once the cases are registered, criminals would avoid committing the crimes, Mr Younas said, adding unattended complaints encourage criminals to commit crimes without fear.

10,"177,000 Pakistani children die before fifth birthday from malnutrition: minister",Says three biofortified wheat varieties that are high in zinc released for general cultivation.,"ISLAMABAD: Micro-nutrient deficiencies are widespread in Pakistan and have profound effects on immunity, growth and mental development of children. Every year, more than 177,000 Pakistani children die before their fifth birthday due to malnutrition.
This was highlighted by Minister for National Food Security and Research Syed Fakhar Imam while addressing participants of a workshop titled ‘Addressing Zinc Deficiency through Biofortification of Zinc Wheat’ on Wednesday.
The workshop was jointly organised by HarvestPlus, Pakistan National Heart Association (Panah) and National Fortification Alliance at the Ministry of National Health Services. It was attended by representatives from various government departments, civil society organisations and UN agencies.

Says three biofortified wheat varieties that are high in zinc released for general cultivation

Mr Imam said more than 50 million people in Pakistan had inadequate zinc intake which was an important micronutrient for our health. 
“In Pakistan, with the collaborative support of HarvestPlus, three biofortified wheat varieties which are high in zinc have been released for general cultivation in the country,” he said, adding that “with our joint efforts, biofortified zinc wheat varieties have been cultivated on 360,000 hectares this year”. 
The minister said over 1.6 million metric tonnes of biofortified wheat grain production were expected with the current crop at the time of harvest. 
“Biofortification is progressing well in Pakistan and has great potential to help reduce zinc deficiency and stunting in the children of our country,” he said.
Sanaullah Ghumman, general secretary of Panah, said malnutrition and dietary factors contribute towards increased morbidity and mortality.
Munawar Hussain, consultant/adviser at HarvestPlus, said the role of media was important in raising awareness among population about issues like zinc deficiency. He requested the media to play its due role towards raising awareness among farmers and other value chain actors about significance of biofortification of wheat.
Dr Imtiaz Hussain, director of Crop Science Institute, National Agricultural Research Centre, said wheat constituted 60pc of the diet of the common population and biofortification of wheat was the most suitable and sustainable strategy to address the zinc deficiency.
Dr Mohammad Imtiaz, wheat value chain specialist at HarvestPlus said a team under Commercialisation of Biofortified Crops (CBC) programme worked with a wide variety of stakeholders from the public and private sectors in Pakistan to popularise nutrient-rich biofortified zinc wheat varieties.
“We have created biofortified wheat production hubs in five districts including Faisalabad, Khanewal, Multan, Bahawalpur and Rahimyar Khan,” he said, adding that technological support will be provided through these hubs to selected farmers and also help in aggregation of biofortified grain after harvest.
Dr Khawaja Masood Ahmed, national coordinator (nutrition) at the health ministry said provincial governments may be encouraged to prioritise procurement of biofortified wheat.
Dr Shahzad Ali Khan said that zinc deficiency has a negative impact on the health of children and adults. Zinc deficiency is one of the causes of high rates of stunting in children, he said, adding inadequate intake of zinc causes growth retardation, loss of appetite and impaired immune functions.
Afshan Tehsin Bajwa said that good nutrition is the fundamental right of every Pakistani. She appreciated the progress made in development of biofortified wheat in Pakistan and hoped that more people will be able to receive wheat that has a higher amount of zinc.

In a statement, RCCI President Nadeem Rauf said it was surprising that the SBP - which as per best practices had reviewed its monetary policy after two months - reviewed it this time within a period of less than a month.
He urged the government to withdraw the hike as it would increase the credit cost of commercial banks, ultimately having a bad effect on the growth of industrial activities and create more difficulties for the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) in its effort to revive the economy.
He said the central bank had raised its interest rate by a sharp 100 basis points in one go, adding that this increase would discourage investors from considering Pakistan for investment.
He said Pakistan needed quick revival of business and industrial activities to improve the ailing economy which had been badly hit by Covid-19, but a 100 basis point increase in interest rate would make the cost of credit unaffordable for the business community and affect their efforts to promote business activities.
Mr Rauf said at present, the government was facing pressure on the fiscal deficit, and this increase in interest rate would raise the budget deficit.

On the directions of the IHC chief justice, the house was returned to the officer of the Foreign Affairs Ministry.
According to the documents available with Dawn, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs nominated assistant director Mohammad Faheem on Nov 1 for the allotment of a house situated in G-6/2 from the Ministry’s Pool ‘with immediate effect’.
Subsequently, the ministry requested the Ministry of Housing and Works to issue a formal allotment letter in favour of Mr Faheem.
As per Rule 4 of the Accommodation Allocation Rules, 2002 “the Estate Office shall not place its accommodation at the pool of any other department except the ISI and Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the houses already placed on the pool of Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the ISI shall be restricted to their present number.”
Interestingly, the Estate Office on Dec 6 issued the allotment letter in favour of Civil Judge Naima Iffat, though she had already been allotted a government flat in F-6/4.
However, the allotment letter for the house was issued to the judge with the condition that she will vacate her earlier government accommodation.
Mr Faheem challenged the Estate Office’s allotment letter before Civil Judge Rana Mujahid Rahim and also moved an application seeking stay order before Civil Judge Sohail Taheem.
His counsel Fida Ahmed contended before the judge that Rule 4 of the Accommodation Rules clearly bars allotment of houses at the pool of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the official of any other department.
Since both the courts did not extend any relief to  Mr Faheem, the Estate Office with the assistance of local police dispossessed him from the house and handed this over to Judge Iffat. Judicial sources when approached said that an inquiry has been ordered against the said judge.
