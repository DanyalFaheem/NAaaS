0,Ex-SHO held for false seizure of pistol from slain student,KARACHI: Police on Wednesday arrested a former SHO of the Orangi Town police station in a case pertaining to the...,"KARACHI: Police on Wednesday arrested a former SHO of the Orangi Town police station in a case pertaining to the murder of a teenage student in a fake encounter.
On Dec 7, a policeman in plain clothes, Toheed, along with his civilian friend Umair gunned down Arsalan Mehsud and wou­nded his friend Yasir near the Qatar Hospital in Orangi Town.
Initially, the police claimed that the victim, who was returning from a tuition centre in Nazimabad, was a criminal, but after widespread condemnation on social media and protests by relatives and community members, it emerged that the encounter was fake and both the suspects were arrested and a case under Section 302 (premeditated murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code was registered.
Area SHO Azam Ali Gopang was also nominated in the case, but he managed to escape and got interim pre-arrest bail from the Sindh High Court’s Sukkur bench.
He appeared before the antiterrorism court concerned, which granted him bail till Dec 28 in the murder case.
SHO Gopang had in his initial report claimed that the teenage had been killed in an encounter with police and a pistol recovered from him.
West SSP (Investigation) Abid Qaimkhani said the police had arrested SHO Gopang on Wednesday as another FIR was lodged against him under Section-24 of the Sindh Arms Act (punishment for possessing arms with intent to use for unlawful purposes) on behalf of the state.
The SSP said the SHO had allegedly tried to foist a weapon on the victim to show an encounter.
The police got the SHO’s remand from the ATC till Dec 19.
The officer recalled that the incident had taken place near the Orangi Town police station where the held SHO was present.
According to the FIR registered under Section 24, the DIG-West had ordered an inquiry to ascertain the claims of the SHO that a weapon was found from the slain student.
“A detailed inquiry based on the statement of witnesses, examination of the crime scene and record showed that the .30-bore pistol was owned by the SHO Gopang,” the FIR read.
Section 24 of Sindh Arms Act says whoever possesses arms or ammunition licensed or unlicensed with the aim to use them for any unlawful purpose can be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years and with fine.

1,Court official restrained from seeking DHA land record,"DHA challenges the maintainability of a suit against misuse of cantonment, reclaimed land.","KARACHI: A division bench of the Sindh High Court has allowed the Defence Housing Authority (DHA) to not share the record of land with a court official until a single bench decides its application about the maintainability of a lawsuit challenging the misuse of cantonment land and land reclaimed from the sea.
The suit filed by Farhan Wazir and five other plaintiffs, mostly residents of the DHA, had approached a single bench of the SHC under the Whistleblower Protection and Vigilance Commission Ordinance, 2019 stating that reclaimed land was being misused while the land meant for cantonment purposes was also being used for commercial and gainful purposes.
They cited the defence secretary, the DHA, Cantonment Board Clifton, Karachi Cantonment Board, Cantonment Board Faisal, Civil Aviation Authority, Karachi Port Trust, Port Qasim Authority (PQA) and several other government authorities and private entities as defendants.
On Dec 1, the single bench had directed the DHA, CAA, PQA and others to provide record and documents of all the land allotted to them including the reclaimed land and its occupation after an official assignee in its report complained that the DHA was not willing to provide the requisite data.

DHA challenges maintainability of a suit against misuse of cantonment, reclaimed land

The DHA filed an intra-court appeal against the Dec 1 order stating that it had filed an application before the single bench about the maintainability of the suit, but instead of deciding it the court had ordered the appellant to provide its land record to the official assignee.
While disposing of the intra-court appeal, the two-judge bench comprising Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi and Justice Rashida Asad asked the single-judge bench to hear the application on the suit’s maintainability first and in the meanwhile implementation on the impugned order remained suspended and no adverse inference be drawn unless the application in question along with other listed applications are finally decided.
In the written order released on Wednesday, the division bench also directed both sides to appear before the single bench to file objections to all the pending applications as well as to the report of the official assignee.
DHA counsel Abid Zuberi filed an appeal before the division bench and argued that the directives were passed by the single bench on the recommendations of the official assignee’s report to which the appellant was intending to file objections.
He submitted that the report of the official assignee was based on the assistance of Marvi Mazhar who was never directed by the court to be associated with the exercise.
The lawyer further submitted that the DHA had also filed an application under Order 7, Rule 11 of the Civil Procedure Code to challenge the maintainability of the suit, but without deciding this issue directives had been issued to the appellant and others to file documents pursuant to the recommendations made by the official assignee in the report.
He stated that the single bench had also issued notices to DHA and others on another application seeking contempt proceedings against them for allegedly violating an earlier order of the bench barring the appellant and others from reclaiming further land from the shore, granting such land to anyone as well as creating third party interest and to ensure that land earlier sanctioned to them as public spaces should not be used for any commercial and gainful purposes.
Plaintiffs’ counsel Khawaja Shamsul Islam said that notices had not been issued to the defendants on the application filed by the appellant. He submitted that the single bench had not passed any adverse final order, but only asked the appellant to submit relevant documents.
After hearing both sides, the division bench said that apparently no final order was passed by the single bench and the appellant was at liberty to file objections on the report of the official assignee as well as assistance provided by Ms Mazhar in preparation of the report.
It asked the single bench to hear the DHA application and in the meanwhile the impugned order issued on the report of the official assignee shall not be implemented and no adverse inference be drawn unless the application in question along with other listed applications are finally decided.
Meanwhile, the DHA and others filed statements before the single-judge bench headed by Justice Zulfiqar Ahmad Khan on Wednesday and denied to have violated the court’s earlier order.
The station commander of the Corps V filed an application to become an intervener in the suit and Justice Khan directed his lawyer to satisfy the court about the maintainability of his application. 
The advocate general sought time to file comments and the bench directed the lawyer for DHA to continue his arguments on an application questioning the maintainability of the suit and adjourned the hearing till Jan 10.
On Dec 1, Official Assignee Dr Chaudary Wasim Iqbal had filed his interim report stating that apparently DHA had been deliberately avoiding producing land allotment documents. He stated that architect Marvi Mazhar volunteered her service about the reclaimed land and to sketch the dimensions and she was requested to provide aerial mapping of the reclaimed land.

2,MQM-P holds women-only protest against LG bill,KARACHI: The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) on Wednesday staged a women-only demonstration in protest ...,"KARACHI: The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) on Wednesday staged a women-only demonstration in protest over the recently passed Sindh Local Government (Amendment) Bill, 2021. 
A large number of women workers and sympathisers from all walks of life gathered at Regal Chowk in Saddar to take part in the protest. 
Carrying placards, party flags and chanting slogans against what they termed a “black law”, they demanded that the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) government further amend the bill to make it more acceptable for people of all ethnic origins living in the province and more effective in terms of power sharing with the local government representatives. 
The party has already announced and appealed to the people across Sindh, particularly its supporters, to come out and protest against the “dictatorial law” the PPP government had passed in the assembly. 
Addressing the protesters, senior leader Amir Khan said the people of Karachi and other cities of the province had given their verdict against the local government law.
The party would continue its struggle against every move made by the PPP government to undermine the powers and resources of the local governments, he added.
“This feudal style of governance of the PPP in Sindh is causing a great deal of unrest among the people and has turned into the feeling of alienation,” he said. “The law passed by the Sindh Assembly is in fact in direct conflict with the Constitution of Pakistan and in flagrant violation of Article 140-A of the Constitution. 
He alleged that the Sindh chief minister was spreading hatred from the floor of the house.

3,PTI demands CM Murad’s apology over ‘anti-state speech’ in assembly,Files a resolution to discuss the chief minister's diatribe in the provincial assembly.,"KARACHI: The opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf on Wednesday demanded an apology from Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah for delivering an ‘anti-state speech’ and warned him that the party’s protest campaign against the recently passed Sindh Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2021 would continue.
PTI lawmakers Khurrum Sher Zaman, Bilal Ghaffar, Jamal Siddiqui, Dr Imran Ali Shah, Raja Azhar, Shehzad Qureshi and Dr Seema Zia submitted a resolution in the office of the secretary of the Sindh Assembly accusing the CM of humiliating opposition members in his recent speech in the assembly.

Party files a resolution to discuss CM’s diatribe in PA

On Dec 11, CM Shah while speaking on the floor of the Sindh Assembly had lashed out at the opposition for ‘trying’ to create a rural-urban ethnic divide and said: “Do you want people from Islamabad to occupy Sindh? The people of Sindh will never allow such an occupation. Yes, we are part of Pakistan and we should be considered a part of Pakistan. Don’t create a situation that people start to think about something different. You are in minority and will remain in minority and can never take decisions.”
The resolution described CM Shah’s speech in the house as a biased statement.
In the resolution, the members took the stand that the CM had made a speech in the assembly against the state of Pakistan. The CM used the phrase to ‘throw the members out of the House’ and the PTI asked him to withdraw his hate speech and apologise on his biased and hateful statement.
Later, talking to journalists after filing the resolution, Mr Sher Zaman said that the PPP government in the province was following a dictatorial policy.
“The PPP is in power in Sindh for the past over 13 years,” he said. “It is their responsibility to take the opposition in confidence. The Sindh government should have talked to the opposition before introducing any law. The Sindh government has provoked the opposition to protest.”
He said that there had never been such protests in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assemblies. “The bill proposed by the PPP has been rejected by all stakeholders. Not only us, but PDM [Pakistan Democratic Movement] people have also declared it a black law.”
Bilal Ghaffar, the parliamentary party leader of the PTI in the Sindh Assembly, said that the chief minister had not learnt to lead the House and always acted like an immature party activist.

4,Cold wave forecast from today in Karachi,The minimum temperature is likely to drop and is expected to range between nine degrees Celsius and 11 °C till Dec 19.,"KARACHI: The city is likely to experience a cold wave from Thursday (today) that will continue for the next three to four days, a Met official said on Wednesday.
The minimum temperature is likely to drop and is expected to range between 9 degrees Celsius and 11 °C till Dec 19.

5,Torturous delays in trials break spirit of cybercrime victims,Hundreds of cases are pending in Karachi under electronic crimes law as FIA fails to complete probes.,"KARACHI: Kubra kept crying quietly for around half an hour as everyone in the courtroom stared at her, until the judge finally broke the silence. 
“Miss what is done is done. But, if you keep silent, you will lose another battle,” he told the young complainant, encouraging her to testify against an accused who was blackmailing her on the basis of her personal videos and pictures. 
“Your testimony can lead to the conviction of the accused, if you speak out,” the male judge told the visibly nervous Kubra  (which is a pseudonym to keep her identity secret), who was still wiping tears rolling down her cheeks and composing herself up to speak. 
Slowly, but carefully she started narrating her ordeal, as she knew she was sharing information too personal to be shared in front of people, mostly men. 
She testified that she had got married to a man from Punjab, who was a personal friend of a former prime minister. 

Hundreds of cases are pending in Karachi under electronic crimes law as FIA fails to complete probe

She further deposed that after sometime of their marriage her husband all of a sudden leaked her personal pictures and videos on social media when they quarrelled over a domestic dispute. 
“This has ruined my life and the honour of my family,” the terrified woman said, adding that the accused was also using his social influence to silence her and her family. 
“He is pressuring us to withdraw the case,” the woman told the court. 
Kubra, who is yet to face tough questions of the defence counsel during her upcoming cross-examination, further said that she had hesitantly filed a case with the Federal Investigation Agency under relevant sections of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA), 2016, but the investigators had failed to complete the investigation after passage of months. 
Kubra isn’t alone. There are dozens of other women, many of them unmarried girls, who have lodged around 1,200 complaints with the FIA’s Cyber Crime Reporting Centre (CCRC) during this year in Karachi alone. 
The cases are pending disposal because of the failure of the FIA’s investigating officers in filing investigation reports with the relevant courts, under Section 173 of the criminal procedure code. 
Judicial sources told Dawn that during hearing of a case it had emerged that around 1,200 complaints were lodged by the public with the FIA’s CCRC in Karachi. 
“The investigating officers have failed to complete those inquiries/investigations despite the lapse of months,” the sources said. 
Judicial Magistrate (South) Mukesh Kumar Talreja recently taking serious exception to the attitude on the part of the FIA’s investigators, had issued a show-cause notice to the additional director of the CCRC asking him to furnish a written explanation as to why he might not be proceeded against for failing to ensure submission of the investigation reports by the IOs. 
Most victims are women
The sources explained that most of the cases had been lodged by citizens, mostly the women, under Sections 13, 14, 16 and 26 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016. 
“These sections relate to the usage of electronic devices for the commissioning of the offence, unauthorised use of (a person’s) identity information, tampering with the communication equipment used in an offence and other offences and pornography, which are punishable under the provisions of the PECA, 2016,” the sources explained. 
“In most of the cases the accused persons befriend young women and when they reject their marriage proposals or refuse to fulfil their immoral demands, the men obtain their personal pictures and videos for blackmailing,” the lawyers and judicial staffers told Dawn. 
“This is not just the case with unmarried women alone. In some cases couples are also involved. 
“In most of the cases female complainants complained that their friends, fiancés or even husbands, over some quarrel or under one pretext or the other or to take revenge, published their personal photos and videos on the social media by creating fake IDs on social media networking sites, such as Facebook, etc.” 
The digital rights campaigners have expressed their grave concern over the manner in which the FIA is dealing with the cases of delicate nature. 
Speaking to Dawn, senior lawyers expressed their concerns about the delays in the process of investigation or inquiries arguing that such cases finally end up in benefitting the suspects. 
“Most of the witnesses, including the victims, become unable to recall the actual facts at the time of recording their testimonies,” they argued. 
They added: “The stage of recording testimonies of the victims and the eyewitnesses is equally important as the circumstantial or material evidence.” 
Digital rights campaigners’ concern
Digital rights campaigner Nighat Dad was not surprised given that around 1,200 online harassment-related cases were pending just in one city: Karachi. 
She told Dawn the situation of cases or inquiries in such cases pilling up were same in other cities of the country as well. 
“The problem is that there is no proper legal procedure defined since the PECA, 2016 is a new law,” she said, adding that the procedures of inquiries or investigation in such cases and then legal trials had to be clearly defined. 
As a result, Ms Dad said it had been observed that either lodging the complaints with the FIA took one or two years and then the legal trials also took two to three years to complete. 
“This is an injustice with a victim/survivor, who finally got enough courage to speak out and report the incident,” she said, adding that because of lengthy investigation and judicial trial procedures it had been noted that many victims or survivors simply give up the battle. 
“And they better ask for Muk Muka (compromise),” She lamented. 
On the other hand, the delays in trials are also tantamount to infringing basic rights of the suspects, if they are booked in false cases.   “Those who have not committed the offence, but have been behind the bars for long time, they are also not getting justice like the survivors.”

Day two of the festival organised by the Idara-i-Taleem-o-Aagahi (ITA) under the umbrella of the Pakistan Learning Festival included the discussion about “Incredible Libraries of Pakistan” at the Arts Council of Pakistan here on Wednesday.  
Poet Zehra Nigah’s verses and Rakae Jamil’s composition again brought up the sweet demand “Humein kitab chahiye, humein kitab chahiye ...”  
CLF’s founder and ITA CEO Baela Raza Jamil stressed the importance of reading books and not just course books but story books and reference ones. “My granddaughter is two months old and she has her own collection of books made out of cloth. Though she is too young to read, she is learning to turn pages,” she shared.  
Senior journalist Zubeida Mustafa explained to students the significance of a library. “A library is a home for books. The concept is for a book to reach a wide readership or readers. The reading can lead to discussions on the books read, things such as liking a book or not liking it and why,” she said, adding that it was also a good idea to give books as gifts. “That will help you develop the reading habit and once you start enjoying reading, you will want more books. Then someone or the other will have to fulfill your demand and set up a library for you,” she added.  
Anila Yousaf of Pishukan, Gwadar, spoke about how she got children in her city fall in love with books. She said Pishukan had a population of 13,000, half of which had not seen much development. “There are no mobiles or internet there, but our children also need to learn about what is going on in the world and what other children in their age are doing. For this we needed interesting books. For that I reached out to donors through social media. Soon we had books and we had a library in our school. To run this library we have made a library committee of students who manage the library and its indexing and borrowing and return of books along with even its cleaning,” she said. “The children who borrow the books also pen their reviews which they share on social media,” she said.  
Deputy Commissioner-South Salahuddin Ahmed spoke about the street libraries of Karachi. “You can’t eat the same food every day. You want different tastes,” he said. “Likewise, your mind too needs different simulations. And a library can offer different types of books on different subjects. Reading different books provides you with knowledge,” he said.  
Shah Manzoor Baloch of Mubarak Village said that his village was one of 107 small goths, the only one with an elementary school. “The school makes our village slightly better, but still the children in our village did not know what a library was until the ITA gifted us a library along with tablets to enjoy ebooks. Though we also don’t get mobile signals or internet in Mubarak Village, we have loaded several books in the tablets for the children to read and enjoy,” he said, adding that the library was a traveling one that went to the children of other goths too.  
Mehwesh Rehman of Happy Home School said that they had a well-stocked library in each of their 10 campuses. “We have proper library periods to develop the reading culture,” she said.  
Artist, writer and teacher Rumana Husain said that last year when all the world was going online due to the Covid-19 pandemic, she happened to be abroad. “But every day for 200 days, I would read a story for children and upload it on YouTube,” she said.  
“When I was little, I remember libraries even as small as pan shops in Karachi. It was thanks to such an environment that I had read Manto, Ghulam Abbas, Krishan Chander by the time I reached class nine. My father had also made me a member of the British Council Library here,” she said, while lamenting the mobile phone culture of today that is hurting children’s attention span. “Our children today don’t even have the patience to listen to their elders. If they read, they only do it to study for their exams,” she said.

8,"Centre, Sindh urged to find amicable solution to MDCAT issue","""Students are suffering from mental anguish due to mere stubbornness of [parties involved],"" says Pima chief Dr Abdullah Muttaqi.","KARACHI: The Pakistan Islamic Medical Association (Pima) has urged the federal and the provincial governments not to put students’ future at stake for the sake of their egos and find an amicable solution to the medical and dental college admissions test (MDCAT) issue. 
“The dispute between the PMC and Sindh health department on the MDCAT is intensifying. But neither the PMC nor the department is ready to budge an inch, causing anxiety among students as well as their parents,” said Pima president Dr Abdullah Muttaqi. 
The PMC, he pointed out, had clearly stated that the medical colleges that would admit students with less than 65 per cent marks would not be recognised and the students concerned would not be registered. 
“At present, students are suffering from mental anguish due to mere stubbornness of (parties involved). Their future hangs in the balance whereas there is no sign that this matter would amicably be resolved any time soon,” he said.
The Pima representatives also questioned the provincial government’s decision to take over Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC)-run healthcare facilities and argued that the solution was not in bringing those facilities under the control of the provincial government. 
“This is so because the provincial government-run healthcare facilities in the province are plagued with countless problems from shortages of human resources and medicines to machines in need of repair for a long time. Many hospital projects are incomplete,” noted Dr Zeeshan Hussain. 
The government should have provided the desperately needed funds to the KMC for the smooth running of institutions instead of taking them over, he said.

They said Allah Dad, 60, was targeted by unidentified person(s) near an A-25 bus terminal.
Ittehad Town SHO Ayaz Khan said the murder appeared to be an outcome of some personal enmity. The victim originally hailed from Benazirabad. 
The body was taken to the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi for a post-mortem examination.
Meanwhile, a 20-year-old man was shot at and wounded when the police guard of a government official opened fire during the ongoing anti-polio drive in New Karachi on Wednesday.
According to SSP-Central Malik Murtaza, a vaccination drive was under way in the presence of an additional deputy commissioner (ADC) in New Karachi, where some parents refused to allow polio workers to administer drops to their children. The situation deteriorated when the police guard of the ADC opened fire. As a result, young Aqeel suffered a bullet wound in the leg and was shifted to a hospital for treatment. 
The guard was taken into custody.

11,Traders’ alliance seeks licence for new chamber in Hyderabad to replace defunct body,HYDERABAD: Newly-formed Hyder­abad Alliance of Trade and Industry’s (HATI) office bearers said on Wednesday they...,"HYDERABAD: Newly-formed Hyder­abad Alliance of Trade and Industry’s (HATI) office bearers said on Wednesday they were seeking licence for the establishment of a new “Hyderabad Chamber”, which would fill the vacuum created by the defunct chamber whose licence had been revoked several years ago.
But still the defunct chamber continued its activities, which was nothing but a fraud with members of business community and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) should take notice of it, they said. 
HATI’s patron Ikram Rajput flanked by chairman Iqbal Baig, president Adeel Siddiqui, senior vice chairman Najmuddin Qureshi and secretary general Ziauddin said at a joint news briefing at a banquet in Latifabad on Wednesday that the vacuum was created when licence of the Hyderabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (HCCI) was revoked several years back. “The defunct body was being used for certain other purposes by those who were occupying it now,” he said.
He said that business community of Hyderabad had been facing serious issues for last several years which remained unresolved in the absence of a proper forum. There was hence need for a new trade body for which licence was being sought by the office-bearers of HATI, he said.
He sought cooperation of business community of Hyderabad to strengthen the alliance which would soon be able to get the licence for new “Hyderabad Chamber” from the commerce ministry. Traders and business community should join HATI which truly represented them at relevant government forums, he said.
The alliance president Adeel Siddiqui, who was vice-president of Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce for Sindh’s chambers, explained how the defunct chamber’s licence was revoked by director general of Trade Organisations and how they were applying for the new license. 
He asked FIA and NAB authorities to take notice of those who were still offering membership to businessmen for the ‘defunct’ chamber. It was pure “fraud” since the “the defunct body can’t be renewed as per law,” said Siddiqui. 
He said that the defunct chamber’s appeal was pending decision and HATI leadership had already applied for fresh licence for the new “Hyderabad Chamber” under new law. The present building of the defunct chamber belonged to business community but still he had applied for another land for establishing the new chamber, he said.
Siddiqui said that a new crisis was in the making for businessmen who had shops and offices on both sides of Autobahn Road as the Pakistan Railways had declared entire land adjacent to the road its property on the basis of a Supreme Court order. 
He said that he had urged the government to get the Hyderabad-Kotri bridge included in CPEC projects. At present, there was no proper forum to raise genuine issues of business community and traders, he said. 
HATI secretary general Ziauddin, who was among the defunct chamber’s leaders, said that he joined the alliance after having realised the old chamber had lost its legal justification and lacked registration by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan.
He said the defunct chamber belonged to business community and not to an individual. If its licence was restored or fresh licence of new chamber was obtained the new chamber would start representing businessmen and traders again, he said.
Hyderabad SITE Association leader Saman Mal said that a strong chamber was direly needed in Hyderabad, which would soon be established to represent businessmen, traders and industrialists. 
Sindh Assembly member and business community leader Nadeem Siddiqui also spoke at the press briefing.

They said at the programme on “Olive orchard establishment, nursery raising and value addition” conducted at Pakistan Agriculture Research Council (PARC) at Arid Zone Research Centre (AZRC) here that under the federal government’s Public Sector Development Program entitled “Promotion and cultivation of olive on commercial scale in Pakistan–Phase-II” the government would assist farmers in cultivation of olive.
The farmers would have to plant, grow, care and water the plant and in return 77 per cent expenses would be borne by the government and the rest of 33pc by the farmer, they said.
Mohammad Waseem Kalroo, project in-charge of the PSDP olive project’s Sindh component, explained the orientation of the project and prospects of its impact and scope in Sindh. 
He compared the potential of marginal lands of the province to Rajasthan region of India, where olive had been adopted successfully. 
He said that they would provide technical assistance to farmers for the cultivation of olive and they would have to plant, grow, care and water the plant. 77 per cent expenses would be borne by the government and 33pc by farmers, he said.
The government departments which intended to grow the plant on state land would be provided the plant free of cost. The project had been running in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, Gilgit-Baltistan and Kashmir since 2010 and now Sindh had been included in its second phase since Oct 27, he said. 
Senior research officer at Pakistan Oil Seed Development Board Islamabad, Dr Azmat Ali Awan, spoke on propagation techniques, cultural practices and value addition of olive. 
He highlighted statistics of world olive consumption and its scope in Pakistan and said the country had more than eight million hectares area of wasteland which could be used for olive cultivation. They could export olive products to the world in addition to making Pakistan self-sufficient in its edible oil consumption, he said.

Sindh Minister for Information Saeed Ghani said at a joint press conference that 2.2 to 3.2 million acres turned barren in the province as the required water was not being released to the sea. “There is acute shortage of water in Rice Canal, Dadu Canal and Balochistan due to water crisis in the province,” he added. 
The minister said that ill-planned Right Bank Outfall Drain (RBOD) and Left Bank Outfall Drain (LBOD) had caused huge losses to the province. 
He said the irrigation department had decided to carry out lining of canals to reduce seepage loss of irrigation water. 
“Since 2008, the provincial government completed lining of 3,200 kilometres of irrigation canals,” he added. 
Shoro said that as many as 15 projects of Annual Development Programme (ADP) would be completed in the current fiscal year, while work on the lining of 509 km of canals was in progress. 
He said that Rs40 billion were earmarked for 138 different schemes of water and drainage which included 84 new schemes. “Besides, Rs546bn have been allocated for four water schemes for the Thar coal region,” he added. 
The minister said that everyone had right to criticise the government, but it was wrong to call a “good local bodies law” negative and engage in ethnic politics on the issue. 
He said the local government law of 2003 was enacted after making improvements in the Sindh Local Government Act, 2001. 
“Mayor did not have powers in the solid waste management in the SLGA 2001 and SLGA 2013. But now the mayor will be the chairman of the solid waste management board,” he added.
