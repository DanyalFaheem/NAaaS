PESHAWAR: Parents of the martyred students of the Army Public School and civil society members on Wednesday held Quran Khwani for the departed souls on the eve of the seventh anniversary of the gruesome attack, which had claimed 147 lives, mostly the students.
The parents, civil society members and students of the schools also held pictures of the martyred students during a walk held on the premises of the Shuhada-i-APS Public Library.
The parents and relatives of the martyred students lit candles on the monument of the Shuhada-i-APS outside the library.
“Despite the lapse seven years of the tragic incident, we are still going from pillar to post for seeking justice,” Ajoon Khan Advocate, president of Shuhada-i-APS Forum told Dawn.
He regretted that the Supreme Court had been adjourning the proceedings of the case time and again, which had caused worries to the parents of the martyred students.
“We will continue our efforts till registration of FIRs against the top security officials who were sitting on responsible positions at the time of the occurrence of the grisly incident on December 16, 2014,” said Mr Ajoon, who had lost his son, Asfand Khan, a 10th grader, in the attack.
He demanded of the Supreme Court to order registration of FIRs against those who were responsible for the security lapse. He said the judicial commission inquiring the attack had mentioned clearly that the incident had occurred due to “security lapse and negligence.”
If a judicial commission has categorically mentioned that their children had been killed due to security lapse and negligence then the Supreme Court should also order registration of FIRs against such people, he demanded. The question that how terrorists entered the sensitive area despite having prior information was yet to be answered, deplored Mr Ajoon.

However, the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf rejected the allegations levelled by the protesters as baseless propaganda.

Mr Shah claimed that the successful campaign of his party for local government elections baffled the opposition parties. “In case the opposition parties have any complaint, they should move Election Commission of Pakistan instead of holding protest demonstrations and sending threats to PTI workers,” he added.
The PTI leader alleged that his party people had solid proofs about violations of the ECP code of conduct by opposition parties in various localities including Mathra, Darmangi, Kochyan and Warsak Road. He said that FIRs should be registered against the violators of the code of conduct.

11,ECP urged to ensure women not disenfranchised,Participants of convention regret parties’ failure to field women candidates,"PESHAWAR: Women election candidates on Wednesday urged the Election Commission of Pakistan to ensure that women aren’t denied the right to vote anywhere in the province, especially in the merged tribal districts, during the Dec 19 local body elections.
They also regretted the failure of political parties to field women for mayor or chairperson elections in 66 tehsil councils of 17 districts and said only one party, Qaumi Watan Party, had awarded ticket to a woman for that election in Haripur.
Those candidates spoke during the Women in Local Government Convention jointly organised by Aurat Foundation and South Asia Partnership Pakistan here.
According to organisers, the event was meant to highlight the ‘plight’ of women candidates and create awareness for better women’s participation in the political process. It was also attended by women election candidates and former and current lawmakers.

Participants of convention regret parties’ failure to field women candidates

The participants passed a resolution urging the ECP to reduce Rs5,000 fee for participation in local body elections to ensure more and more people contest for reserved seats in the next phase.
They also demanded amendments to the Elections Act, 2017, for binding political parties to award five per cent of LG election tickets to women like the National and provincial assembly polls.
Aurat Foundation programme officer Saima Munir said a false impression had been created that women could contest elections only for the seats reserved for them in village and neighborhood councils and not for general and other seats reserved for youth, peasant/workers, and minorities.
She claimed that some ECP returning officers had discouraged women from filing nomination papers for general seat elections.
The participants demanded of the ECP to impose the condition of re-polling in a constituency, where votes cast by women were less than 10 per cent of the total votes polled, to polling stations so that women couldn’t be stopped from exercising their right to vote in any area.
They asked political parties to ensure effective participation of women in their decision-making process.
Several women candidates complained that their and their family’s votes were shifted to other areas without any notice.
They also insisted that in some cases, nomination papers were rejected just because votes of proposers or seconders were shifted to other village councils.
ECP director (elections) Khushalzada said the commission, in its strategic plan, had been working on gender mainstreaming in electoral process.
He said the law didn’t discriminate against the people on the basis of gender and that if such discrimination existed, the local cultures were to blame for it.
About the complaints about the transfer of votes to other areas, he said votes were registered in accordance with permanent or temporary address of an individual given in his or her CNIC. He said that display centres were set up for correction of votes, but people rarely turn up there for corrections and came to know about the place of their vote at the eleventh hour.
Former provincial minister and social activist Mussarat Qadeem said the local government institutions were of immense importance for women as they served as the basic tier of democracy and a nursery for them to participate in national and provincial politics.
She said many women councillors were elected MNAs and MPAs and they played an effective role in legislation.
Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf MPA Zeenat Bibi said women lawmakers had been vocal for pro-women legislation in the provincial assembly.
She said the assembly passed laws against domestic violence and harassment at workplace and for the rights of home-based workers.
Jamaat-i-Islami leader and former district naib nazim in Peshawar Dr Iqbal Khalil said the women elected on reserved seats should highlight the issues of women from their respective councils, especially about education and healthcare.
Provincial chief of the National Party Dr Sarfraz Khan complained that the ECP hadn’t enforced the five per cent mandatory election nominations for women in letter and spirit as political parties mostly fielded them in the constituencies, where their electoral position was weak.

13,Covid restrictions relaxed in six KP districts as cases dip,The government has decided to incentivise high vaccination cities allowing them to revert to normal activities.,"PESHAWAR: The government has relaxed Covid-19 restrictions in six more districts due to a decline in coronavirus positivity rate and increased vaccination against the pandemic as the health department is struggling to ensure immunisation of students and staff in private schools.
A notification issued by the home and tribal affairs department on Wednesday said that Covid-19 restrictions were relaxed in Orakzai, Swabi, Kurram, Buner, Abbottabad and Battagram owing to progress on immunisation and slump in infectivity level of the virus.
A fortnight ago, the department had exempted three districts including Peshawar, Chitral and Mansehra from Covid-19 restrictions and had retained standard operating procedure in rest of the province.
Now, except nine districts, the restrictions would remain in place in accordance with the decision of National Command and Operation Centre, which has issued guidelines to ensure precautionary measures in cities with low vaccination rate and high positivity rate.
The notification said that government had decided to incentivise high vaccination cities allowing them to revert to normal activities through relaxation in non-pharmaceutical interventions.
Meanwhile, the health officials said that 12 million (50 per cent) people in the province received first dose and 33 per cent second got second dose of the vaccine.
“We have to inoculate 24 million target people above 12 years through an ongoing process of administering jabs to them at the centres working in government hospitals,” they said.
They said that it was needed to motivate the recipients of first dose of the vaccine to get second shot and stay safe.
They added that about 8 million people (33 per cent of the target population) had got first dose and were required to get the second one.
The officials said that vaccination was above 50 per cent in urban areas of Peshawar but it was 30 per cent in rural parts of the provincial capital. The main issue was reluctance on the part of private schools to ensure vaccination of students and staff, they added.
“We have held meeting with the authorities concerned to ensure inoculation of all their students and workers as it has been declared an obligatory regime. The schools not cooperating would be closed,” they said.
According to law invoked to ensure compliance with the Covid-19 SOPs, the district administration can close schools and impose a penalty of Rs1 million on them.
The officials said that in each district, a daily meeting took place with deputy commissioners in the chair to review Covid-19 related matters including immunisations and adherence to (SOPs.
They said that the meetings made decisions in accordance with the guidelines issued from office of chief secretary.
They said that private schools had their own issues. Many of the parents were unwilling to give consent for vaccination of their sons and daughters, they said.
The notification of home department said that outdoor marriages were allowed only for fully vaccinated maximum 500 guests and indoor for 300 immunised participants while outdoor gatherings would be allowed for fully vaccinated 1,000 people.
Indoor and outdoor dining is allowed for fully vaccinated individuals till 11:59pm whereas indoor dining can take place with 50 per cent occupancy and home delivery will be allowed round-the-clock.
All public and private offices and departments will continue work with full attendance of staff but all employees must be fully vaccinated.
