0,Govt raises Rs1.37tr with no change in T-bills yields,Dollar at new peak of Rs177.98 against the rupee.,"KARACHI:  The cut-off yields on treasury bills remained flat in a crucial auction  on Wednesday despite another 100 basis points hike in the policy rate  by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Tuesday making the total  increase of 250bps to 9.75pc within a short span of 25 days.
The previous auction held on Dec 1 had seen a quick reaction and  the cut-off yields in all three tenures were increased while the highest  jump of 229bps was noted in three-month papers. 
The latest auction shows the yields were almost flat for all tenures while the highest bids were offered for the three-month T-bills.
The SBP in its Monetary Policy Statement on Tuesday said that the sharp increase in cut-off yields in the last T-bill auction was unwarranted. 
The government remained  short of the target as it could borrow a total of Rs1.37 trillion (including  Rs94.5bn through non-competitive bids)  against the target of  Rs1.4tr while the maturity amounted to Rs1.5tr.
For three-month  tenor,  the government borrowed Rs805bn at 10.78pc while for six-month it raised  Rs385bn at 11.5pc and for 12-month it picked Rs95bn at 11.51pc. 
The rising interest rate is making borrowing costlier for the government as well as the private sector. The strategy for a higher interest rate is to counter the sharp increase in inflation. 
“Due to year-end and  ahead of the resumption of IMF programme, today’s T-bill auction was important  for interest rate direction for local markets. The government had set auction target at Rs1.4tr, which  made it even more important at a time when the interest rates are rising and borrowing from the SBP is restricted due to IMF  conditions,” said Mohammad Sohail, CEO of Topline Securities. 
The next T-bill auction is scheduled for Dec 29 to borrow Rs1.2tr against a maturity amount of Rs1.1tr.  
The  SBP governor in an interview has assured the market that the interest rate would  not go up to 13pc in the future and would remain unchanged in the near term. However,  the bids of Rs1,385bn for three-month papers indicate that the market did not heed the assurance. 
The  government rejected all bids for Pakistan Investment Bonds for  semi-annual auction while it raised Rs128bn through quarterly  auctions.
Dollar at new peak
Meanwhile, the 10-paisa gain tossed the US dollar to yet another record  high of Rs177.98 against the rupee in the interbank market on Wednesday.
Currency market experts said the demand is still high for the  greenback which means the price would remain on the higher side in the  coming days. 
So far the US dollar has risen by 13pc in the current  fiscal year as economic managers have failed to take any concrete measure to control the ever-increasing dollar prices. However, the central bank  believes the free-floating exchange rate is the right response against  the higher current account deficit which would be 4pc of GDP for  the FY22.

2,Govt allows Rs10m collateral-free loans in SME policy,Rs30bn earmarked to develop small and medium enterprises.,"ISLAMABAD: The government has unveiled the new Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) Policy 2021-25, with focus on promoting around five million businesses through facilitation in registration, streamlining of taxes, access to credit and provision of land. 
Overall, the policy is aimed at providing facilities and incentives to the SME sector, which contributes around 40 per cent to the GDP and accounts for 25pc of all exports. 
Unveiling the policy on Wednesday, Minister for Industries and Production Khusro Bakhtiar said that for the first time in Pakistan an all-inclusive SME policy had been launched, which had divided these enterprises into three sectors, including low risk, medium risk, and high risk. 
The government has decided to establish an SME fund amounting to Rs30 billion, and restructure Small and Medium Enterprise Development Authority to make it a more private sector–driven entity. 

Rs30bn earmarked to develop small and medium enterprises

“This policy addresses all the issues hindering SME sector’s development in the country, such as unnecessary inspection that only adds to the cost of doing business,” he said while addressing a news conference. 
The new SME policy has been approved by the federal cabinet and it is expected to be notified by the Ministry of Industries and Production in the coming days. 
Flanked by Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry, Mr Bakhtiar added that even before the approval of the SME policy by the cabinet, key initiatives on SMEs, including access to credit, lowered tax regime and regulatory simplifications, had been launched. 
Mr Bakhtiar said there were a total of 5.2m SMEs in Pakistan, which were the backbone of the economy as they represented over 99pc of the country’s total business and employing over 78pc of the non-agriculture labour force. 
He said the provinces had also approved the “Zero Time to Start-up Policy”, aimed at extending facilitation and incentives to promote the growth of small and medium enterprises. 
Under the policy, a no-objection certificate (NOC) is not required for start-ups and expansion to low-risk businesses, including the service sector, transport, wholesale, etc. 
The medium-risk SMEs — including the light engineering, leather, auto parts, cutlery, sports goods, etc. — will be provided with the NOC within 30 days, and if the certificate is not issued within that time by the relevant authorities, it is deemed that the NOC has been issued. 
“And there is a limited segment such as those dealing in explosives, fire equipment, boilers, chemicals, etc. that are in the high-risk businesses category,” the minister said. 
Another facility under the policy is the abolishing of the government’s regulatory interference, including the “Inspector-Less Inspection Regime”. 
“To eliminate harassments and bribes by the inspectors, a self-declaration by SMEs on regulatory compliance and an e-inspection portal to monitor and self-verification of on-site inspections visits have been introduced,” Mr Bakhtiar said, adding: “We need to look into the reduction of over-regulations of the industries, mainly the SMEs, and the matter is under discussion with the provinces.” 
The new policy also offers tax incentives to SMEs in the manufacturing sector by reducing the turnover tax rate from 1.25pc to 0.25pc for enterprises having an annual turnover below Rs100m, while the tax rate has been fixed at 0.5pc for units with a turnover between Rs100m and Rs250m. 
Besides, the ‘Aasan Finance Scheme’ is being introduced under the new policy to ensure access of capital to the industries, Mr Bakhtiar said. Loans up to Rs10m with lower markup rates of 9pc will be provided without any collateral for setting up 30,000 new businesses. Also, Rs23.5bn has been allocated to share up to 60pc financial loss borne by SMEs. 
Venture capital regulations will be reviewed to support the growth of this sector for providing equity finance to start-up SMEs, including those in the IT sector. 
Under the policy, 4,200 acres have been allocated to develop 19,500 plots at the dedicated industrial infrastructure for SMEs. Market access regulations are being revised to allow greater SME participation in the public sector procurement of goods and services. In addition, the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan will ensure increased SME participation in international trade fairs and exhibitions. 
The SME policy has a special focus on supporting women entrepreneurship by attaining greater access to finance, awareness and training, while an SME registration portal has been launched to provide one-point access to all incentives available to these enterprises. Women-led enterprises have been given a 25pc rebate in tax. 
The last SME policy was announced in 2007, but it failed to facilitate the sector’s growth.

3,"PSX, German bourse sign agreement",Official says national stock exchange already has “tens of data clients around the world”.,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) has signed an agreement with Deutsche Börse under which the German stock exchange will act as the exclusive licensor of the PSX market data to all current and prospective international data consumers for five years. 
Speaking to Dawn on Wednesday, a PSX official said the national stock exchange already has “tens of data clients around the world”.  
“The PSX has been issuing licences to international data clients like Bloomberg until now. Going forward, Deutsche Börse will issue licences on our behalf while we’ll continue delivering the data,” he said, adding that licence fees constitute an “important” revenue stream for the exchange. 
On the local front, however, the PSX intends to continue issuing licences itself. “The local market is not as developed as the international market. Yet we have multiple clients within Pakistan that buy our data,” he said. 
The exchange said in a press release Deutsche Börse will be the sole licensor for international customers Jan 1 onwards — a move that will allow the national stock exchange to “extend its market data reach globally… with the aim of leveraging Deutsche Börse’s international reach to significantly expand its market data client base and attract foreign investors to participate in PSX’s markets”. 
A range of data products will be accessible to international clients through Deutsche Börse as the offering includes real-time, delayed as well as end-of-day data. 
The PSX sells at least six kinds of data services and vending products, including real-time feeds, end-of-day data, historical data, corporate announcement feed and general data services. Clients of general data services include major international redistributors, like Bloomberg LP and Markit Group Ltd.

4,FPCCI asks govt to address concerns of Quetta traders,KARACHI: The Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) has urged the authorities concerned to...,"KARACHI: The Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) has urged the authorities concerned to immediately address the concerns of traders in Quetta and the rest of Balochistan to resume import and export activity in the province. 
Responding to the situation arising out of a strike called by the Quetta Chamber of Commerce and Industry against the “unfair, illogical and illegitimate conduct” of customs intelligence in the province, FPCCI President Mian Nasser Hyatt Maggo said it was tantamount to discouraging legal importers and exporters and encouraging smugglers, according to a statement issued on Wednesday.  
FPCCI’s Vice President Nasir Khan said cargo vehicles full of import and export goods were being stopped by the customs intelligence for no valid reasons, creating a huge backlog for the traders of Balochistan and inflicting unbearable financial losses to them. 
Traders are left with no other option but to go on an indefinite strike against the customs intelligence department, he said, adding that the traders would not call off the strike until their concerns are addressed and the leadership of the department is replaced with an honest and competent one.

Secretary Finance Hamed Yaqoob Sheikh updated the NPMC meeting that the prices of the wheat flour bags remained consistent at Rs1,100 per 20 kg due to the proactive measures of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa governments as well as the Islamabad Capital Territory administration. 
The daily release of wheat by all the provincial governments will further ease out wheat prices at a national level. However, by-products of wheat especially bread of all varieties posted an increase despite government claim that wheat prices remain stable. 
Mr Tarin appreciated the efforts of Sindh government and stressed ensuring the availability of wheat flour at government prices in Karachi and Hyderabad. 
While reviewing the price of sugar in the country, secretary finance informed the committee that the prices were decreasing. “New stocks of sugar are arriving in the market which will further reduce the prices,” he added.
