0,WI eye consolation win as Pakistan seek series sweep,KARACHI: The narrow nine-run defeat in the second Twenty20 International against Pakistan had left West Indies...,"KARACHI: The narrow nine-run defeat in the second Twenty20 International against Pakistan had left West Indies captain Nicholas Pooran with a feeling of what could’ve been.
The three-match series is gone already, with Pakistan having an unassailable 2-0 lead, but Pooran doesn’t want to be left with the same feeling again on Thursday.
“If we knew why we make mistakes, we’d be the best team in the world,” Pooran told reporters on Wednesday, a day after the loss and a day before the final game of the series.
“Playing against Pakistan, which is among the finest teams in the world, and in their own backyard isn’t easy but we did well yesterday and we will look to build upon that tomorrow. We deserve a victory.” 
Pooran is leading a largely inexperienced West Indies team, short of their big name players due to injury or otherwise before being robbed of three more players due to positive Covid-19 tests, but what he saw on Tuesday gave him hope as his side put up a more spirited effort following a 63-run hammering in the opening game of the series a day earlier.
“We’re improving day by day,” Pooran, who was elevated as captain after Kieron Pollard failed to recover from a hamstring injury, said. “If we played yesterday’s game two months down the road, it would’ve been different. There is a process towards winning [matches]. It’s a learning process for us, it takes time to win and we understand that.”
Pooran got a glimpse at West Indies’ potential future on Tuesday with Brandon King playing a stunning 67-run knock and Romario Shepherd showing his power-hitting prowess late on here at the National Stadium.
“I’m extremely happy with the performances of this team The attitude is good and I’m happy to see guys putting their hand up in the last game when no one really gave us a chance. Brandon showed his talent with a very good innings. Romario, Odean Smith and Akeal Hosein are all wonderful to see.” 
It was a three-wicket 17th over by Pakistan’s pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi which knocked the stuffing out of the West Indies. 
King had already departed earlier as the West Indies slipped from 127-5 to 131-8 by the end of that over, eventually being dismissed for 163. 
“We needed a wicket at that time,” Shaheen said following the match. “The older ball helps the fast bowlers and I was trying to bowl wicket to wicket and I found success.” 
Pakistan will be looking for a sixth T20 victory on the trot on Thursday, having whitewashed Bangladesh 3-0 away last month. 
Prior to that, they had won all of their five group matches at the T20 World Cup in the UAE before losing to eventual champions Australia in the semi-finals. 
The current run holds Pakistan in good stead with the Twenty20 World Cup coming again next year in Australia. 
“It’s been a team effort … everyone is performing since the World Cup,” all-rounder Shadab Khan, the man-of-the-match in the second T20, said. “We are showing the attitude that is needed for international cricket … and for T20 cricket in particular.”

1,"Govt to form 500-strong pool of elite athletes, says PSB director general","""Measures are being taken to promote sports on a solid basis instead of just providing employment to athletes,” says Asif Zaman.","LAHORE: The government has a plan for Pakistan’s sporting revival. 
Moving towards a regional system instead of a departmental one — where public departments set up teams in various sporting disciplines and offer jobs to their players — that plan will see departments being given the responsibility of raising the profile of a single sport.
That, it contends, will help in tending to the needs of an elite panel of 500 athletes. 
“We have picked around 350 athletes from different sports and the target is to raise it to 500,” Pakistan Sports Board director general retired Col Asif Zaman told Dawn on Wednesday. 
“The measures are being taken to promote sports on a solid basis instead of just providing employment to athletes,” he added, saying negotiations were underway with both private- and public-sector institutions to pick any one sport and invest heavily on that. 
“For example, the government may ask National Bank of Pakistan to take care of hockey instead of investing in several other sports,” continued Asif. 
Asif informed that suggestions and recommendations were being sought from the government departments regarding the role of their sports departments. He, however, made it clear that athletes won’t be financially-hit by the reform process. 
“Instead, the players will be given a roadmap to work hard in order to maintain their position to get maximum incentives,” he said. “The problem with the current system is that sportspersons lose their ambition after getting permanent jobs.” 
He said hockey and squash had been placed on the priority list as Pakistan seeks to return to its former glories in both sports. 
The PSB has recently provided funding to the Pakistan Hockey Federation to appoint Dutch coach Siegfried Aikman and Asif said that it was also looking at getting the best trainer in squash. 
“Provincial governments of Sindh and Punjab are also giving funds to the PHF,” he informed. 
He also said that national sports federations had to expand their roles in order to search for talent by holding annual events. 
Asif said the PSB was trying to ensure that two per cent of the government budget was spent on sports activities at all levels.  
“Since there was no regulatory body, that wasn’t implemented in letter and spirit,” he lamented. 
The policy of spending two per cent of the budget on sports was introduced during the tenure of Gen Pervez Musharraf as president but funds given to commissioners and deputy commissioners were used on holding festivals and cultural activities. 
Asif also said that the PSB was willing to host the 2023 South Asian Games in collaboration with the Pakistan Olympic Association. 
The two bodies have been at loggerheads over deciding the final venues and the government is yet to issue letters in various aspects including security as well as issuance of visas to participating nations. 
“The issues will be resolved in order to hold the Games in a befitting manner,” Asif concluded.

2,Bruised England look to crash Australia’s pink ball party in Adelaide,Only one team have come back from a 2-0 deficit to win the Ashes — the Don Bradman-captained Australia in 1936-37.,"ADELAIDE: England are preparing to throw the kitchen sink at Australia in the day-night second Ashes Test starting at the Adelaide Oval on Thursday in a bid to level the series after seeing their best-laid plans torn to shreds in the Gabba opener. 
Only one team have come back from a 2-0 deficit to win the Ashes — the Don Bradman-captained Australia that pulled off the comeback for the ages in 1936-37. 
While Joe Root has enjoyed a Bradman-esque 2021 with the bat, scoring  the most runs in a calendar year by an English batsman, it might be a  stretch to compare his team with the Depression-era Australians. 
And they face a rejuvenated side that has turned day-night cricket  into a competitive advantage, winning all eight of their Tests under  lights — five of those in Adelaide — dating back to the format’s 2015 debut. That run included the 120-run victory over Root’s England in Adelaide  during the 2017-18 series, which stretched Australia’s lead to 2-0 on  the way to a 4-0 hiding. 
Where England have recalled heavyweight veteran pacers Stuart Broad and James Anderson for the second Test, Australia have their own swing maestro in Mitchell Starc and a proven pink ball performer in skipper Pat Cummins.
Starc took an eight-wicket match haul in the 2017 Ashes test in Adelaide, while Cummins, the world’s top-ranked Test bowler, has racked up 26 day-night wickets in five matches at an average of 16.23.
Pace, however, is not the be-all and end-all at the Adelaide Oval. Spin also has a role, as Nathan Lyon’s six wickets in 2017 showed.
Adelaide Oval curator Damian Hough said England would be missing a trick if they did not pick a specialist spinner.
“History says that the pitch will spin,” Hough told reporters on Wednesday. “Nathans always played a role out there. So from our end we believe that spin at Adelaide needs to play a part.” 
Anderson said he wants to play all four remaining Ashes Tests after he and Broad were included in England’s 12-man squad for the second Test.
The two greatest wicket-takers in England Test history, with 1,156 scalps between them, were controversially left out for the series opener at Brisbane, where they crashed by nine wickets inside four days.
But both are back in the frame for the clash under lights at Adelaide, where the pink ball’s extra movement should suit their game.
Their return means speedster Mark Wood, who impressed in Brisbane, has been rested with selectors opting instead for fellow pacemen Ollie Robinson and Chris Woakes.
They also kept faith with spinner Jack Leach, who was punished in Brisbane but could come into his own on Adelaide’s traditionally spin-friendly wicket.
A final decision on who to omit will be made at the toss after a last look at the wicket on what is forecast to be a fine, dry day.
“I came here wanting to be available for five [Tests] and that doesn’t change now, I want to be available for the next four,” said a defiant Anderson, 39, who has taken a record 632 Test wickets — more than any other seam bowler in history.
“I think the gaps between the next few Tests, it might be a bit easier to get that rest in between and make sure everyone’s fresh, but that’s something out of my control. I’ve just got to do my best if I get picked tomorrow.”
WARNER FIT, RICHARDSON REPLACES HAZLEWOOD
Meanwhile, Cummins said opener David Warner will play through the pain in the second  Ashes Test as Jhye Richardson got the nod to replace Josh Hazlewood.
Warner  scored 94 in the first innings at the opening Test in Brisbane but  didn’t field or bat in Australia’s second innings as he nursed bruised  ribs after being pummelled by the England attack. The 35-year-old  padded up in the Adelaide Oval nets on Tuesday evening and made several  audible cries of pain, but Cummins said he would play the Test.
“He [Warner] will be right, he had a bat yesterday and  batted with a bit of discomfort, but knowing Davey he’s not going to  miss this one,” Cummins said.
“He’ll be fine once the adrenaline kicks in. It’s one thing batting in the nets and another when you walk out in front of a packed crowd.
“He’s  played close to 90 Tests and I’m sure a lot of them have been played in  discomfort,” he added of the flamboyant star, who will open the innings  alongside Marcus Harris.
The only change Cummins named to the  side that crushed England by nine wickets at the Gabba last week was  Richardson as replacement for Hazlewood, who was ruled out this week  with a side strain.
Right-arm quick bowler Richardson had been in  contention with Michael Neser and will add to his two Tests,  spearheading the attack alongside Cummins, Starc and Lyon.
Squads:
AUSTRALIA: Marcus Harris, David Warner, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith, Travis  Head, Cameron Green, Alex Carey, Pat Cummins (captain), Mitchell Starc,  Nathan Lyon, Jhye Richardson
ENGLAND: Jimmy Anderson, Stuart Broad, Rory Burns, Jos Buttler, Haseeb Hameed, Jack Leach, Dawid Malan, Ollie Pope, Ollie Robinson, Joe Root (capt) Ben Stokes, Chris Woakes.

3,Kohli says was sacked as ODI captain on 90-minute notice,NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli said on Wednesday he was told only 90 minutes before the official announcement that he had...,"NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli said on Wednesday he was told only 90 minutes before the official announcement that he had been sacked as India’s One-day International (ODI) captain.
Kohli quit as T20 skipper after the recent World Cup and last week lost the ODI job too, with India’s cricket board saying it wanted Rohit Sharma to lead in both white-ball formats.
The surprise announcement came in one line at the bottom of a press release by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) about the Test squad for the upcoming tour of South Africa.
“I was contacted one and a half hours before the selection meeting on the 8th for the Test series and there was no prior communication to me at all,” Kohli told reporters on Wednesday ahead of the team’s departure for South Africa, where they will play three Tests and three ODIs.
“Before ending the call I was told that the five selectors had decided that I would not be the ODI captain, to which I replied, ‘ok fine’,” the 33-year-old said.
Right-handed batter Kohli will still captain India in the Tests in South Africa but press reports suggested that he had decided to skip the subsequent ODI series in a huff.
But Kohli denied this, telling reporters on Wednesday that he  “was and am available for selection” and hit out at sections of the media for  “writing lies”.
“Nothing can derail me from being motivated to play for India,” he said.  “I am very focused and mentally prepared and very excited to go to South Africa and do the best that I can for my team.”
Kohli said he would support  “100 percent” Rohit and new manager Rahul Dravid, calling him a  “very balanced coach” and a  “great man-manager”.
“Rohit is a very able captain and very, very tactically sound. We have seen that in the games that he captained for India and in the IPL as well,” Kohli said.
India have never won a Test series in South Africa, but Kohli said the visitors were motivated by the fact that the last Test they played there, in Johannesburg in 2018, they won.
“We probably won in the toughest conditions in that tour, so that should give us a lot of confidence that if we have the right mindset and we start out the series with a lot of confidence, we can definitely stand up to any challenge that comes our way,” Kohli said.
“South Africa is one place where we have not won a series yet. We are very motivated to do that and the mindset is always [to] go out there and win a series in any country that we play. We don’t anymore just think of winning a Test match in India,” he added.
This year India beat Australia 2-1 Down Under — albeit in Kohli’s absence apart from the first Test — and were 2-1 up in England before the tour was called off because of the pandemic.
Last week in India, they thrashed New Zealand by 372 runs to win the series 1-0, avenging their loss to the Black Caps in the inaugural World Test Championship final in England in June.
“South Africa presents a different kind of challenge. The wickets present a lot of pace and bounce and you need to be at your absolute best to be able to perform there and get runs,” Kohli said.
“I think we are very well placed in terms of experience and belief and confidence that this time around we can do something special and get the results that we want as a team.”

5,"Michael Slater arrested again, charged",He appeared in court in Sydney’s northern beaches and was granted bail on the condition that he checks into a mental health unit.,"SYDNEY: Former Australia Test cricketer Michael Slater was charged on Wednesday with breaching a restraining order, two months after his arrest over allegations of domestic violence.
New South Wales state police said that Slater was arrested for a second time on Wednesday morning after reports he allegedly breached the restraining order, known as an Apprehended Violence Order or AVO.
The 51-year-old later appeared in court in Sydney’s northern beaches and was granted bail on the condition that he checks into a mental-health unit  “as soon as a bed is available”, court documents show.
Slater is facing charges of contravening the restrictions set down in an AVO, using a carriage service  “to menace/harass/offend” and breaching bail, police said.
It follows similar carriage service charges — which can relate to harassment via phone, email or social media and stalking — first laid after reports of a domestic violence incident on Oct 12.
Under his bail conditions, Slater was barred from drinking alcohol, taking non-prescribed drugs and possessing or using electronic devices including a mobile phone.
Opening batsman Slater played for Australia for close to a decade, hitting 5,312 Test runs before his 2004 retirement.
Slater’s case is scheduled to return to court on Dec 23.

Kevin De Bruyne struck twice, while Phil Foden, Jack Grealish, Riyad Mahrez, John Stones and Nathan Ake also got on the scoresheet as the champions overpowered Leeds 7-0 on Tuesday night.
In a tight title race, the flurry of goals moved City within two of Liverpool’s goal difference of plus-33.
“We didnt score as many goals this season,” manager Pep Guardiola said, “but today was a good run to be close to Liverpool and Chelsea.”
City has a four-point lead over 2020 champion Liverpool, which plays Newcastle on Thursday. That’s when Chelsea, which is a point further back, hosts Everton.
The seven-goal defeat equaled the worst losing margin in the history of Leeds. Marcelo Bielsa’s team is five points above the relegation zone.
“There is nothing positive to take away from our performance. I cant find anything that can be valued,” Bielsa said. As is natural in these cases, it is not the individuals that fail but the organization.
There is no justification I can offer,” he continued,  “the game was exactly how we thought it was going to be. We prepared ourselves to avoid everything that happened and we didn’t manage to get anything.
Guardiola had warned that Leeds high-tempo style would need to be countered and City did this by tearing into the visitors from the outset.
“We lost five points last season playing Leeds,” Guardiola said.  “We tried to prepare well and maybe the players felt it was a more serious team than people think about. We saw the game against Chelsea (a 3-2 loss for Leeds on Saturday) and they deserved to take a point with the way they fought. Maybe they were a little bit tired.
With Rodri producing one of his best performances in a City shirt, the hosts attacked at will and with great fluidity.
City was absolutely relentless after Foden guided in a shot from outside the box in the eighth minute.
Another goal followed just five minutes when Mahrez curled the ball back into the area for Grealish to head into the net.
Rodri played in De Bruyne to thump in a low shot in the 32nd and the only surprise was it took City until four minutes into the second half to score again when a shot from Mahrez deflected in off Junior Firpo.
De Bruyne was on target again with a ferocious long-range strike in the 62nd and Stones scored in the 74th.
Akes powerful header completed Leeds misery four minutes later.
VILLA REVIVAL 
With four wins now in six games as manager, Steven Gerrard is transforming Aston Villas fortunes.
The former Liverpool captains latest success was getting the better of the manager he replaced at Villa last month as Dean Smiths new team, Norwich, was beaten 2-0.
Jacob Ramsey played a one-two with Ollie Watkins by the halfway line and ran at the defense before firing the ball past goalkeeper Tim Krul in the 34th minute at Carrow Road.
The second came in the 87th when 18-year-old substitute Carney Chukwuemeka got away down the left and squared for Watkins to tap home.
While Norwich is in last place in the Premier League, Villa is up to ninth after the resurgence under Gerrard. Smith was fired by Villa after five straight losses but he quickly filled Norwich’s managerial vacancy.
Norwich is three points from safety approaching the midway point of the season after picking up only five points in Smiths six matches.

BARCELONA’S forward Kun Aguero looks on as he addresses a press conference to announce his retirement from football, at the Camp Nou on Wednesday.—AFP

 
BARCELONA: Fighting back tears, Barcelona striker Sergio Aguero announced his immediate retirement on Wednesday for health reasons.
The 33-year-old Argentina striker underwent heart tests after leaving the field, holding his chest, during Barcelona’s match against Alaves in the Spanish league on Oct. 30.
His condition has since been evaluated, and a sobbing Aguero said at a Camp Nou press conference attended by Barcelona players and board members, family and former colleagues that he had decided to stop playing.
“I’d like to stay here and keep helping my teammates,” Aguero said, “but things happen for a reason.”
Aguero said he made the decision 10 days ago. He was told after his first heart test that there was a big possibility he could not play again.
He took deep breaths and shook his head before making the announcement, then looked on in sadness as a highlight reel of his career highlights was shown on the screen.
Aguero is one of the worlds most well-known players, having only joined Barcelona in the offseason after ending a 10-year stint at Manchester City during which he became a great of the English game.
Using his explosive movement and powerful shot, Aguero scored a club-record 260 goals for City and was a key player in the growth of the team as a major force in England and Europe. He had a record 12 hat tricks in his total haul of 184 Premier League goals, the most for an overseas player and the fourth most all-time.
He also scored arguably the Premier Leagues most famous goal, the dramatic stoppage-time winner against Queens Park Rangers that clinched the title for City on the final day of the 2011-12 season.
Aguero, who joined City from Atletico Madrid in 2011, struggled with injuries in his final two seasons at City and missed the start of his first season at Barcelona because of fitness issues. He only played in five games for the Catalan club.
For Argentina, Aguero scored 41 times in 97 matches putting him third on the national teams all-time scoring list after making his senior team debut in 2006. That came between two world titles for Argentina’s youth teams.
Aguero’s only major title with Argentina came at this years edition of the Copa America, in which he barely featured, and he also won the Olympic gold medal in Beijing in 2008.

13,European clubs may withhold players for Africa Cup of Nations,"The Cup of Nations, which was already postponed last year, is due to start in Cameroon on Jan 9 and run until Feb 6.","PARIS: Europe’s top clubs are threatening not to release players for the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Cameroon over fears surrounding its Covid-19 health protocol.
The European Club Association, which represents leading clubs across the continent, made its concerns known to FIFA in a letter seen by AFP.
“With regards to applicable protocols, as far as we are aware, CAF (the Confederation of African football) has not yet made available a suitable medical and operational protocol for the AFCON tournament, in the absence of which clubs will not be able to release players for the tournament,” the ECA told football’s world governing body.
The Cup of Nations, which was already postponed last year due to the health crisis, is due to start in Cameroon on January 9 and run until February 6.
Many of Africa’s leading players are based at clubs in Europe, including Liverpool duo Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane, Riyad Mahrez of Manchester City, Achraf Hakimi and Idrissa Gana Gueye of Paris Saint-Germain.
The ECA also raised concerns about the danger of players being unavailable for even longer periods due to the potential for travel restrictions or mandatory quarantine being introduced, in particular in relation to the emerging threat posed by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.
According to FIFA’s rules for the release of players for international duty during the pandemic, clubs can retain players if  “there is a mandatory quarantine of at least five days on arrival” in the place  “where a national team match is supposed to take place” or when the player returns to his club.
An executive board meeting of the ECA — which represents almost 250 European clubs — on Dec 2 said these principles  “must be strictly respected”, according to the letter sent to FIFA Deputy Secretary General Mattias Grafstroem.
“Should this not be the case...players (should) not be released for international duty”.
Clubs could lose players who are called up for the 24-team tournament from as early as December 27, which is particularly problematic for those based in England, where there is a busy schedule of matches over the holiday period in late December and early January.
“For certain clubs expected to release players, including English and French clubs, domestic competition matches are due to take place up until early January and hence the overlap of the 2022 AFCON release dates...are unmanageable,” added the ECA, whose chairman is Qatar’s Nasser al-Khelaifi, also the president of PSG.
CAF general secretary Veron Mosengo-Omba is currently in Cameroon overseeing final preparations for the delayed tournament.
The organisation refused to comment on the ECA threat when contacted by AFP but, in an update on its website, said that Mosengo-Omba  “urged everyone to work around the clock to ensure that everything is in place for the opening game”.
However, the pandemic would appear to pose a far bigger threat to the successful staging of the tournament than concerns about the host nation’s readiness.
The CAF update said its president, Patrice Motsepe, had been in discussions with the Cameroonian government  “on sanitary approach and Covid-19 protocols”.
When contacted by AFP, a senior official in the Cameroonian Football Federation (Fecafoot) dismissed any suggestion the tournament could be called off as  “fake news”.

14,Gnabry hat-trick sees Bayern go nine-points clear in Bundesliga,BERLIN: Bayern Munich opened a nine-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga on Tuesday as Serge Gnabry claimed a...,"BERLIN: Bayern Munich opened a nine-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga on Tuesday as Serge Gnabry claimed a hat-trick and Robert Lewandowski scored twice in a 5-0 rout at strugglers Stuttgart.
Gnabry scored either side of half-time before the flood gates opened with three goals in a devastating five-minute spell including two by Lewandowski in quick succession.
Bayern head coach Julian Nagelsmann poured praise on Gnabry —  “an outstanding player” — who had a role in all five goals, including two assists for Lewandowski.
The Poland striker took his tally to 18 goals in 16 league games this season as Bayern earned a 10th straight Bundesliga win at Stuttgart dating back to 2009.
“Bayern can dismantle teams. Not only in Germany, but also internationally,” said Stuttgart sports director Sven Mislintat.
“We were taught a lesson after they went 3-0 up — they’ve incredible quality.” The Bavarian giants remain on course to win a 10th consecutive Bundesliga title, but second-placed Borussia Dortmund can trim the lead when they host bottom side Greuther Fuerth on Wednesday.
Injuries and illness meant Bayern again fielded Jamal Musiala, 18, out of position in the defensive midfield alongside Marc Roca. They then lost winger Kingsley Coman to a leg knock in the opening half hour.
Coman’s replacement Leroy Sane set up Gnabry’s opening goal by charging through a gaping hole, which grew wider when Stuttgart centre-back Waldemar Anton lost his footing.
Sane squared to Stuttgart-born Gnabry who curled his shot around home goalkeeper Florian Mueller to make it 1-0 at the break.
Stuttgart raised the tempo at the start of the second half as strikers Philipp Foerster and Omar Marmoush both had chances, but it was virtually one-way traffic from Bayern thereafter.
The visitors doubled their lead when Marmoush yielded possession and the ball was moved to Gnabry who again curled his shot around the diving Mueller.
Stuttgart’s defence capitulated as Bayern scored three goals in five devastating minutes.
It started when Gnabry’s long-range pass picked out Lewan­dowski who chipped Mueller.
Moments later, Gnabry dribbled into the box and set up Lewandowski who tapped home with a well-timed slide.
Bayern were now in full flow.
Gnabry claimed the second Bundesliga hat-trick of his career when he slotted home after Thomas Mueller’s shot had been parried by Stuttgart’s luckless goalkeeper.
Later, South Korean forward Lee Jae-sung scored the opening goal as Mainz climbed to sixth and into the European places with a 4-0 romp at home to Hertha Berlin, who remain just two points from the bottom three.
Wolfsburg twice threw away the lead in crashing to a sixth straight defeat in all competitions as French veteran striker Anthony Modeste headed in a late winner to seal Cologne’s 3-2 away victory.

Though Shozab Raza too scored a hat-trick, but that could not save his team from the defeat. Mohammad Adeel added lone goal for the losers. Obaidullah was declared man-of-the-match.
In an earlier match, District Malir overcame District Korangi 2-1 to earn full points.
Mohammad Adnan and Zohaib Khan netted one goal apiece for District Malir outfit while Meesum Abbas reduced the deficit for the losers.
