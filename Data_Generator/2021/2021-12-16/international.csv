0,Chemical air pollution creates new toxins over time: study,"The previously unidentified products are present in the atmospheres of 18 big cities, including New York and Tokyo.","PARIS: Remnants of industrial chemicals in the air can potentially transform into new substances more toxic and persistent than the original pollution, according to a global study published on Wednesday.
Using samples gathered around the world, the study published in Nature found that these previously unidentified products are present in the atmospheres of 18 big cities including Lagos, New York, Tokyo and Warsaw.
Regulatory guidelines like those listed in the Stockholm Convention assess the danger of different chemical pollutants based on how long they remain in the environment, how toxic they are and to what degree they contaminate living things.
But, the study notes, this approach has been limited to a list of known substances and does not take into account how they may change as they break down.
The research proposes a new framework using laboratory tests and computer simulation to predict what chemicals will arise as products interact with the air and how toxic they will be.
Study main author John Liggio, a research scientist for Environment Canada, worked with a team to test the framework on nine flame-retardant chemicals most commonly found in the atmosphere.
“They are chemicals that are added to a large variety of materials to delay the onset of fire,” Liggio said.
In a laboratory, they observed how these chemicals changed over time when in contact with oxidants in the air and found that they gave rise to 186 different substances.
Comparing these new substances with field samples, they found 19 derived from the five most common flame retardants. None of the 19 had ever been identified in the ambient atmosphere before.

1,"Spacecraft ‘touches’ sun for first time, dives into its atmosphere","CAPE CANAVERAL: A NASA spacecraft has officially touched the sun, plunging through the unexplored solar atmosphere...","CAPE CANAVERAL: A NASA spacecraft has officially touched the sun, plunging through the unexplored solar atmosphere known as the corona. 
Scientists announced the news on Tuesday during a meeting of the American Geophysical Union. 
The Parker Solar Probe actually flew through the corona in April during the spacecraft’s eighth close approach to the sun. Scientists said it took a few months to get the data back and then several more months to confirm them. 
“Fascinatingly exciting,” said project scientist Nour Raouafi of Johns Hopkins University. 
Launched in 2018, Parker was 13 million kilometres from the centre of the sun when it first crossed the jagged, uneven boundary between the solar atmosphere and outgoing solar wind. The spacecraft dipped in and out of the corona at least three times, each a smooth transition, according to scientists. 
“The first and most dramatic time we were below for about five hours... Now you might think five hours, that doesn’t sound big,” the University of Michigan’s Justin Kasper told reporters. But he noted that Parker was moving so fast it covered a vast distance during that time, tearing along at more than 100 kilometres per second. 
The corona appeared dustier than expected, according to Raouafi. 
Future coronal excursions will help scientists better understand the origin of the solar wind, he said, and how it is heated and accelerated out into space. 
Because the sun lacks a solid surface, the corona is where the action is; exploring this magnetically intense region up close can help scientists better understand solar outbursts that can interfere with life here on Earth. 
Preliminary data suggest Parker also dipped into the corona during its ninth close approach in August, but scientists said more analyses are needed. It made its 10th close approach last month. 
Parker will keep drawing ever closer to the sun and diving deeper into the corona until its grand finale orbit in 2025. 
The latest findings were also published by the American Physical Society.

2,S. Arabia links normalisation with Israel to acceptance of 2002 peace initiative,"SAUDI Arabia is ready to normalise relations with Israel based on the 2002 Arab initiative for peace, Riyadh’s...","SAUDI Arabia is ready to normalise relations with Israel based on the 2002 Arab initiative for peace, Riyadh’s  permanent representative to the United Nations said on Tuesday. 
In an interview with Arab News, Abdallah Al Mouallimi  said Riyadh was committed to the 2002 proposal, which called for the end of Israeli occupation over all Arab territories taken in the 1967 war and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital in return for normalisation of ties. 
“The official and the latest Saudi position is that we are prepared to normalise relations with Israel as soon as Israel implements the elements of the Saudi peace initiative presented in 2002,” Al Mouallimi said. 
He added that once Israel implemented the initiative, it would have recognition “not only from Saudi Arabia but also the entire Muslim world — all 57 countries of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation”. 
“Time does not change right or wrong. The Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories is wrong no matter how long it lasts,” the diplomat said. 
Israeli media reported last month that a delegation of 20 American Jewish leaders had visited Saudi Arabia and met senior officials there, including ministers and senior representatives of the royal house, in an effort to review possibilities of establishing ties between Riyadh and Tel Aviv. 
Saudi Arabia has been repeatedly expressing its commitment to the parameters for peace with Israel spelt out in the 2002 Arab Initiative. 
Israel occupied East Jerusalem during the 1967 war and annexed the entire city in 1980 in a move that has never been recognised by the international community.

3,"Iran, UN agree on replacing damaged cameras at nuclear complex","The two sides “will continue to work on remaining outstanding safeguards issues with the aim of resolving them”, says IAEA.","TEHRAN: Iran and a UN watchdog said on Wednesday they have reached agreement on replacing cameras at a nuclear complex, as Western powers warn time is running out to revive a deal on Tehran’s atomic programme.
The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) had been seeking to replace the devices which Iran says were damaged in a June attack it blames on Israel.
The IAEA  “will soon install new surveillance cameras at Iran’s Karaj centrifuge component manufacturing workshop under an agreement reached today by Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi and the Head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Mohammad Eslami,” an IAEA statement said, calling this  “an important development”.
It added that the two sides  “will continue to work on remaining outstanding safeguards issues with the aim of resolving them”.
Earlier this year Iran began restricting some IAEA inspection activity as part of steps it has taken away from the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers after the United States unilaterally pulled out in 2018 and reimposed crippling sanctions on Tehran.
“In a gesture of goodwill, Iran is allowing the IAEA to install new cameras to replace those damaged in a sabotage operation” against the Karaj nuclear site, said Iran’s Nour news agency, considered close to the Islamic republic’s Supreme National Security Council.
“This is a voluntary action by Iran to end misunderstandings in its relations with the IAEA,” it said.
Grossi held talks in Tehran last month aiming to tackle the constraints on inspections, outstanding questions over the presence of undeclared nuclear material at sites in Iran, and the treatment of IAEA staff in the country.
Those talks were  “inconclusive” but  “constructive,” he later said, just before talks resumed between Tehran and several global powers to revive the 2015 agreement which aims to prevent Iran from building an atomic bomb.
“Due to the completion of the safety investigation of the damaged cameras, as well as the agency’s decision to condemn the sabotage in the TESA complex and to accept the technical inspection of the cameras by Iranian experts before their installation, Iran has authorised the agency to replace the damaged cameras with new ones,” the Nour report said. The development was also reported by other Iranian news agencies. Iran accuses its arch foe Israel of being behind the attack on the TESA Karaj centrifuge component manufacturing workshop on June 23.
At the time, it had said it thwarted the attack on the building without identifying the nature of the incident.
Until Wednesday, Iran had turned down the IAEA’s requests to replace the cameras. Negotiations resumed on Thursday last week to try to revive the 2015 deal under which Iran pledged to reduce its nuclear capabilities — under IAEA supervision — in exchange for sanctions relief.
On Monday diplomats from Britain, France and Germany — among the nations negotiating with Iran — said  “real negotiations” have yet to start.
“We are losing precious time dealing with new Iranian positions inconsistent with the JCPOA or that go beyond it,” they said, referring to the 2015 agreement. On Tuesday the top US diplomat, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, referred to the European statement and said Washington was preparing  “alternatives” in case the Vienna talks fail. On Tuesday an Iranian government spokesman said an agreement could be reached  “quickly” if the Western states were serious about sanctions lifting and stopped making  “threats”.
Among the key sticking points are precisely which sanctions Washington will lift and the guarantees demanded by Iran to safeguard against future changes of heart from the US.
Iran says it only wants to develop a civilian capability but Western powers say its stockpile of enriched uranium goes well beyond that, and could be used to develop a nuclear weapon.

4,US Navy fires laser weapon in Mideast,The system can be used to counter bomb-laden drone boats deployed by Yemen’s Houthi rebels in the Red Sea.,"DUBAI: The US Navy announced on Wednesday it tested a laser weapon and destroyed a floating target in the Mideast, a system that could be used to counter bomb-laden drone boats deployed by Yemen’s Houthi rebels in the Red Sea.
The test on Tuesday saw the USS Portland test-fire its Laser Weapon System Demonstrator at the target in the Gulf of Aden, the body of water separating East Africa from the Arabian Peninsula.
The Navy’s Mideast-based 5th Fleet described the laser as having successfully engaged the target in a statement. Previously, the Portland used the laser to bring down a flying drone in May 2020.
The Gulf of Aden sits along the southern coast of war-torn Yemen, which has been at war since Iranian-backed Houthi rebels seized its capital, Sanaa, in 2014. A Saudi-led coalition entered the conflict in March 2015 but the stalemate conflict has dragged on for years, becoming the world’s worst humanitarian disaster and killing an estimated 110,000 people.
The war also has bled into the surrounding waterways, like the Red Sea and the Bab el-Mandeb, which connects the sea to the Gulf of Aden. These waterways lead to the Suez Canal and onto the Mediterranean Sea, making them crucial for international shipping and global energy supplies.
The Houthis have deployed drone boats into these waters, which can be piloted remotely and sent up to a target before detonating. These boats are suspected of being built with Iran’s help.
Emirati officials in 2018 showed off footage they described as coming from a drone boat computer that had Iranians building components for the boats guidance system, with a hat visible in the background of one picture bearing the symbol of Iran’s hard-line paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. Iran has denied arming the Houthis, though United Nations experts, independent analysts and Western nations point to evidence showing Tehran’s link to the weapons.
The Portland, a San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock, has its home port in San Diego. The ship is deployed as part of the Essex Amphibious Ready Group that’s now in the Mideast.

5,Xi supports Putin’s pursuit of guarantees from West,Putin informs his Chinese counterpart about mounting threats to Russia’s national interests from the US and the Nato bloc.,"MOSCOW: Chinese President Xi Jinping supported Russian President Vladimir Putin in his push to get Western security guarantees precluding Nato’s eastward expansion, the Kremlin said on Wednesday after the two leaders held a virtual summit.
Putin and Xi spoke as Moscow faces heightened tensions with the West over a Russian troop buildup near Ukraine’s border. In recent weeks, Western nations engaged in diplomatic efforts to prevent a possible invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin has denied harboring plans to storm its neighbour.
Putin, meanwhile, demanded guarantees that Nato will not expand to Ukraine or deploy troops and weapons there.
He told Xi on Wednesday about mounting threats to Russia’s national interests from the US and the Nato bloc, which consistently move their military infrastructure close to the Russian borders, Putin’s foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov, said.
The Russian leader stressed the need to hold talks with Nato and the US on legally binding security guarantees, according to Ushakov. Xi responded by saying he understands Russia’s concerns and fully supports our initiative to work out these security guarantees for Russia, Ushakov said.
He said Moscow’s proposals have been passed on to US Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Karen Donfried, who visited Moscow on Wednesday and met with Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov.
In recent years, China and Russia have increasingly aligned their foreign policies to counter US domination of the international economic and political order.
Both have faced sanctions China over abuses against minorities, especially Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, and for its crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, and Russia for annexing Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula and over the poisoning and imprisonment of opposition leader Alexei Navalny.
Beijing and Washington also remain at odds over trade, technology and China’s military intimidation of Taiwan, which it claims as its own territory.
Russia’s relations with the US sank to post-Cold War lows after it annexed Crimea in 2014 and threw its weight behind a separatist insurgency in Ukraine’s east. Tensions reignited in recent weeks after Moscow massed tens of thousands of troops near Ukraine’s border, a move Ukraine and the West feared may indicate plans for a new invasion.
Moscow has denied that it plans to attack Ukraine and in turn blamed Ukraine for its own military buildup in the country’s war-torn east. Russian officials alleged that Kiev might try to reclaim the areas controlled by the rebels by force.
It is within that context that Putin has pressed the West for guarantees that Nato will not expand to Ukraine or deploy its forces there.

6,"Former generals, envoys want US to rebuild Afghan banking system","“We believe the United States has a reputational interest and a moral obligation to help the Afghan people,” they say.","WASHINGTON: Twelve former US generals and ambassadors have urged the Biden administration to help rebuild a banking system in Afghanistan to prevent a total collapse of the Afghan state.
“In addition to food and medicine, Afghanistan needs a stable medium of exchange and a functioning banking system to avoid experiencing widespread economic and governance failure,” they said in a joint message released by a US think-tank, the Atlantic Council. 
Three of the signatories — Generals John Campbell, John Nicholson and David Petraeus — have commanded US and Nato forces in Afghanistan while two — Ryan Crocker and Richard Olson — have served as US ambassadors to both Afghanistan and Pakistan.
“We believe the United States has a reputational interest and a moral obligation in vigorously joining efforts to help the Afghan people preserve at least some of the social and economic gains made over the last twenty years,” they wrote.
“We believe that ways to do so can be found, while erecting barriers to assistance being diverted to purposes other than those for which it is intended.”
The signatories reminded the Biden administration that even under the Taliban control the “Afghan civil society continues to exist, and it is important that the United States and other international donors continue to work with it.”
The United Nations, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and other donors have also issued appeals, warning of the humanitarian catastrophe emerging with the imminent collapse of the Afghan economy.
Soon after Aug 15, when the Taliban seized Kabul, the United States, and its key allies, cutoff external assistance to Kabul and froze Afghanistan’s monetary reserves under their control. This eliminated 40 percent of the country’s gross domestic product and 75 percent of the government’s budget.
The former US generals and diplomats warned that Afghanistan’s banking system was on the verge of collapse and the currency was losing value rapidly, adding that prolonged drought, a raging Covid-19 pandemic, and the disintegration of government services had worsened the situation.
They also quoted from recent UN reports, warning that “Afghanistan teeters on the brink of universal poverty, with as much as 97 percent of the population in danger of falling below the poverty line by mid-2022.”
Their appeal also includes the World Food Programme’s estimates that “only 5 percent of Afghan households have sufficient food to eat each day.” WFP predicts that Afghanistan “is poised to become the world’s largest humanitarian crisis.”
The UN’s humanitarian chief laments that “Afghanistan’s economy is unraveling before our eyes.”
US generals and diplomats reminded Washington that Afghan health professionals, teachers, and other essential workers must be paid if the most basic functions of the state are to be maintained. “Ordinary Afghans deserve access to their own funds, now frozen in banks wary of US and international sanctions and the potential collapse of the Afghan financial system,” they wrote. 
Stressing the need to revive the Afghan banking system, they pointed out that Afghans abroad also needed the financial mechanisms to send remittances to their relatives, some of whom were left behind by cumbersome US rules on who qualifies for refugee and immigrant status.
The Biden administration, however, remains reluctant to do anything that helps the Taliban regime, but media reports indicate that US policy makers were considering various options to stabilise the Afghan currency and avert the collapse of the banking system.
The former US officials argued that the Taliban takeover had also disappointed them, but they believed that the US had “a reputational interest and a moral obligation” in helping the Afghan people preserve at least some of the social and economic gains made over the last twenty years.”
“We therefore recommend that the Biden administration, … in close coordination with key allies, come forward with tangible proposals to help stabilize the Afghan economy,” they wrote. “Delay will only fuel more death and suffering.”

7,Two Saudi women set to compete in Dakar Rally in historic first,Women were not allowed to drive cars in Saudi Arabia until a ban was lifted in 2018.,"RIYADH: Mashael Al-Obaidan and Dania Akeel will be the first female drivers from Saudi Arabia to compete in the Dakar Rally next month, the Saudi Automobile & Motorcycle Federation said on Wednesday.
The 44th edition of the endurance rally in Saudi Arabia is more than 8,300 kilometres long with a route that traverses deserts and mountains and the duo will drive up to 600km a day in a taxing schedule.
Women were not allowed to drive cars in Saudi Arabia until a ban was lifted in 2018.
“To drive on this famous event in Saudi is a dream come true,” Al-Obaidan, 33, said.  “I’m doing what I love and I’m receiving so much support from people who say that what I am doing is inspiring a lot of people.
“When I finished seventh on the hardest round in the (FIA World Cup for Cross Country Bajas) series, against competitors who had been competing in the sport for more than 15 years, I knew I could do this.
“I soon realised that I was unlocking doors and breaking down barriers with my achievements. We are paving the way for females to understand the journey we are taking and to join us.”  Akeel, also 33, spent last year recovering from a fractured spine and multiple pelvic breaks following a crash on the track in Bahrain but that did not put her off racing as she won the overall title at the FIA World Cup for Cross Country Bajas.
“Those months after the crash were painful, but in some ways I was lucky because I didn’t need surgery. In motorsport you accept the risks and ultimately you have to make a choice,” Akeel said.
“You have got to respect the Dakar. It’s the longest rally on the calendar and Saudi is an incredible location.
