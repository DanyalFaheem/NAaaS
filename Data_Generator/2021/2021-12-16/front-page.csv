He was quoted as saying: “I hope that the world with not repeat the mistake of disengaging with Afghanistan and the international community will support the vulnerable people of Afghanistan.”  
The prime minister highlighted that Pakistan had already pledged an immediate relief in the shape of humanitarian assistance worth Rs5 billion. The package comprised food items, including 50,000 tonnes of wheat, emergency medical supplies and winter shelters.

Prime Minister Khan said that humanitarian organisations wishing to work from Pakistan to support efforts in Afghanistan should be facilitated as Pakistan had already committed to being the air and land bridge for humanitarian support to Afghanistan.  
On Sunday, Pakistan is hosting an extraordinary session of foreign ministers of member countries of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in Islamabad to highlight the plight of vulnerable Afghan people in these testing times and to discuss ways for helping them.

This decision has been made on humanitarian grounds and for helping people of Afghanistan. The government will also facilitate registration process of international NGOs working for welfare and assistance of the Afghan people. Similarly, the process of obtaining Pakistani visas for the Afghans has been further eased.  
The facility for Afghans migrating to other countries through Pakistan has been extended for another 60 days. This facility includes travel by land and air routes.

1,State has no right to pardon killers of  APS students: Zardari,Says negotiations with terrorists and killers who are challenging the state amount to weakening the writ of the state.,"ISLAMABAD: Expres­sing concern over non-implementation of the National Action Plan (NAP) against terrorism, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) co-chairman and former president Asif Ali Zardari on Wednesday declared that the state had no right or authority to pardon the killers of the innocent children who were martyred in the terrorist attack on Army Public School (APS) in Peshawar in 2014.  
“The National Action Plan was a pledge to wipe out terrorists from the country. Unfortunately, the promise made to the nation has not been fulfilled which has resulted in terrorists killing our soldiers even today,” Mr Zardari said in a message on the seventh anniversary of the APS tragedy falling on Dec 16 (today).  
The former president paid rich tribute to the APS martyrs and said that as long as the killers, planners and their facilitators were not brought to justice, “the state and the nation will remain indebted to the martyrs”.  
“The hearts of not only the families of the martyrs but also of every conscientious human being are still bleeding,” he added.  
In the deadliest terrorist attack in the country’s history, 131 schoolchildren and 10 other people were martyred when heavily armed militants stormed the school building on Dec 16, 2014. The banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) later claimed responsibility for the attack.  
Mr Zardari said these terrorists would never be forgiven. He promised the families of the martyrs that if given the opportunity, the ruthless terrorists would be brought to justice and given exemplary punishment. He said the homeland would be cleansed of enemies and terrorists like the PPP had done in Swat during its government.  
In an apparent reference to the reports and announcements by the government that it was holding negotiations with the TTP with the help of the Afghan Taliban, Mr Zardari said the state had no right or authority to pardon the killers of the innocent schoolchildren. He said that negotiations with the terrorists and killers who were challenging the state amounted to weakening the writ of the state.  
In his message, Mr Zardari also paid tribute to the valiant soldiers who had sacrificed their lives fighting the terrorists who had killed thousands of innocent men, women and children in the country. Calling these soldiers “brave sons of the nation”, he said: “These soldiers paid supreme sacrifice against the enemies of our motherland.”  
It may be recalled that the banned TTP had on December 9 declined to extend the month-long ceasefire with the government, accusing it of failing to honour the decisions reached earlier. A statement issued by the TTP had also given out details of the six-point agreement that it said it had reached with the government under the aegis of the “Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan” on October 25.  
Earlier, in an audio message, Mufti Noor Wali Mahsud of the TTP had announced an end to the ceasefire and asked his fighters to resume attacks past 12am. The ceasefire had come into effect on November 9.  
After entering into the dialogue with the TTP, Prime Minister Imran Khan and a number of government ministers had offered an amnesty to the TTP if it abandoned its terrorist activities and agreed to function within the country’s constitution.  
The parents of the martyred students had also rejected the government’s proposed amnesty to the proscribed TTP and warned of protest demonstrations if the terrorists were given amnesty.  
Meanwhile, National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser and Deputy Speaker Qasim Suri in their joint statement said the 16th December reminded them of the tragic and barbarous acts of extremists and terrorists who killed innocent children and teachers in Peshawar for their nefarious designs.  
They said that such barbarity and cruelty were unprecedented as no religion allowed killing humanity. They said “sacrifices” of the innocent children of APS Peshawar would not go wasted and the scourge of terrorism and extremism would be rooted out from society.  
Speaker Qaiser said the nation and the leadership took a clear and categorical decision for an indiscriminate action against terrorists after the APS incident. He said Pakistan was a nation which was matchless in bravery and resoluteness and would emerge as victorious and prosperous at the end of the day. He said the nation would always stand by the bereaved families and continue to share their inexpressible grief.  
The speaker remarked that with the support of the nation, the armed forces had achieved peace and harmony in the country through Zarb-i-Azb operation.  
Deputy Speaker Suri said the people of Pakistan were resilient and had withstood the hardest times. He expressed his optimism that with the concerted efforts of the government and the armed forces, the scourge of terrorism would be exterminated forever.  
According to the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan, a prayer ceremony was organised at the office of Qasimabad Business Forum in Hyderabad to pay tribute to the martyrs of the APS tragedy. The International Human Rights Movement had organised the ceremony.

2,Ministerial body proposes major reforms in sugar sector,Sugar Sector Reform Committee recommends sugarcane pricing based on sucrose content.,"• SSRC recommends sugarcane pricing based on sucrose content
• Go-ahead given to sweetener’s import, export to be controlled
• Heavy penalties suggested for delayed sugarcane crushing, cartelisation    
ISLAMABAD: A ministerial panel on Wednesday called for major reform in the sugar sector, suggesting a shift in sugarcane pricing on the basis of sucrose content without any government role, freedom to import sugar but controlled export in case of surplus and imposition of heavy penalties for delayed sugarcane crushing and cartelisation by mills. 
The Sugar Sector Reform Committee (SSRC), led by Energy Minister Hammad Azhar, was constituted by the federal cabinet in June 2020 following massive price hike in November 2019 and subsequent investigations by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).  
The crisis had shaken the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government in the Centre and Punjab, which led to parting of ways between Prime Minister Imran Khan and his longtime friend, Jehangir Khan Tareen. 
The reform committee suggested a series of amendments to several federal and provincial laws and fixed new roles for Pakistan Commodities Exchange Control (PMEX) and Suparco to streamline the entire supply chain.  
It suggested increasing the fine to Rs5 million as well as one-year imprisonment to late crushing mills and imposing Rs75 million worth of penalty for cartelisation. 
The SSRC conceded that the sugar advisory board based in the Ministry of Industries and Production had viewed that the price hike in November 2019 was not due to market forces and had asked provinces to invoke price control and profiteering act to counter unfair market practices. However, later the board felt that ‘there was real shortage of sugar”, exerting pressure on prices, and therefore banned export of sugar but advocated imports. 
The committee recommended strong media campaigns against use of sugar by people because of its health hazards as it noted that 30pc of the total sugar produced was consumed by households while the remaining 70pc was utilised for commercial use.  
It said the major reason for price volatility and speculation was the result of unregistered supply chain at undisclosed locations. 
Therefore, it suggested that the commodity should be deposited at accredited warehouses regulated by a collateral management company (CMC) after customer due diligence through electronic warehouse receipts while its trading and settlement records be maintained by PMEX to provide a level-playing field to market participants for efficient price discovery.  
The committee recommended abolition of legislation by provincial governments on zoning of crops and leaving the choice of what to grow to farmers and market forces.  
On the issue of delayed crushing, the committee observed that the Sugar Factories Control Act 1950 provided for crushing between the period starting from Oct 1 to Nov 30 each year, which was considerably a long period and should be curtailed. 
The committee stressed the need to provide enabling legal instruments to provinces for intervention in case of delayed crushing, and observed that legislation carried out by Sindh was ideal as no date was defined and the date for crushing was approved by the cabinet each year under the Sugar Factories Control Act 1950. 
It also proposed amendments to Sugar Factories Control Act 1950 to do away with indicative price but called for giving two to three years’ time to farmers to make adjustments.  
Pricing of sugarcane should be according to the sucrose content and the provincial government should provide the latest equipment and laboratories to cane commissioners for testing of sucrose content and implementation of new pricing mechanism, it suggested. 
The committee also called for adequate pricing of water on volumetric basis to avert market failure and remove externalities, leading to incorporation of actual cost of production of sugarcane. Under the new legislation, the provinces would be required to supply water to cropping areas. 
It said farmers and the private sector should have free choice of area to cultivate crops and set up sugar mills through abolition of Sugar Factories Establishment and Enlargement Act 1966.  
The government would invest in efforts to improve seed technology and study beet sugar cultivation and the relevant authorities would initiate programmes for seed improvement to enhance sucrose content in sugarcane and increase per hectare yields as well as consume less water. 
For improvement in forecasting and provision of accurate data of sugarcane crop, Suparco and provincial crop reporting departments need to collaborate and employ modern techniques for accurate reporting of data about sugarcane crop production to the federal government. 
It also suggested a cost-benefit analysis of cultivation of different crops to review relative importance of crops for Pakistan viz-a-viz area under cultivation to enable the government to devise required interventions. 
The State Bank of Pakistan would be required to issue advisory to commercial banks to inspect their pledged sugar stocks, and to verify, their presence with the collaboration of the Federal Board of Revenue and cane commissioners.  
The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan would be required to amend relevant laws for audit of cost accounts sugar mills.

3,SC wants HEC to issue degrees to students of illegal campuses,ISLAMABAD: A three-member bench of the Supreme Court on Wednesday...,"• Orders special arrangement for the purpose
• Asks govts to cooperate with HEC to end illegal activities     
ISLAMABAD: A three-member bench of the Supreme Court on Wednesday directed the Higher Education Commission (HEC) to formulate a procedure to make a special arrangement for issuance of degrees to the students who have passed out from ‘illegal campuses’ of some private universities. 
The bench comprising Justice Umar Ata Bandial, Justice Sajjad Ali Shah and Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah also ordered the HEC to ensure closure of the illegal campuses and uniform implementation of its policies across the country. 
The apex court was hearing the matter pertaining to non-issuance of degrees to the students who passed out from illegal campuses of the private universities. 
Preston University and Al Khair University allegedly ran ‘illegal’ campuses in Karachi and Lahore. In their petition, students of these campuses urged the court to direct the HEC to issue degrees to them. 
During the course of proceedings, the bench ordered the HEC to formulate a procedure and through some special arrangement issue degrees to the students who had passed out from the ‘illegal’ campuses. 
Justice Bandial, however, said uniform implementation of the HEC’s policies should be ensured across the country. He said no compromise could be made on the provision of higher education to the youth.  
The SC directed the federal and provincial governments to fully cooperate with the HEC to maintain uniform standard. 
The bench observed that the basic issue to ponder over was whether private universities could set up sub-campuses outside their territorial limits, while the HEC had already declared they could not do so before issuing many alerts in this regard. 
The court noted that the HEC believed cooperation from the federal and provincial governments was essential to end such illegal activities, but the Centre and provincial governments had not cooperated with the commission. 
When Advocate Ali Zafar, counsel for the students, said that the court had ordered the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to pursue action against such private varsities, Justice Bandial said the HEC had the powers, therefore, there was no need for the accountability bureau to investigate the matter. 
If the HEC was a weak institution, the federal government could be ordered to amend the relevant laws, Justice Bandial remarked. 
Advocate Zafar said the students had approached the Lahore High Court (LHC) for their degrees and the LHC had declared the sub-campuses of private universities ‘illegal’. 
Justice Bandial observed that the LHC verdict was based on facts. He then directed the HEC to ensure implementation of its policies. 
In its order, the apex court noted that the HEC in its stance sought assistance from the authorities concerned to stop the illegal activities of the varsities, but the Centre and provincial governments had not helped the commission.

4,"Petrol, diesel prices cut by Rs5 per litre",GST on all petroleum products up by 2-3pc and commissions for dealers and OMCs by 23-25pc,"ISLAMABAD: The government on Wednesday cut the prices of all petroleum products by Rs5 to 7 per litre for next 16 days (until Dec 31) to pass on partial impact of lower international oil prices.  
In doing so, the government increased general sales tax on all petroleum products by two to three per cent and commissions for dealers and oil marketing companies (OMCs) by 23-25pc. Otherwise, the prices of petrol and high speed diesel (HSD) would have gone down by Rs10.30 and Rs8.65 per litre respectively.  
An official said the government would keep on increasing petroleum levy and GST on each alternative fortnight as the international prices go down. The rate of petroleum levy would keep going up by Rs4 on the first of every month until it reaches a maximum of Rs30 per litre and GST adjustments would take place on the 15th of every month, depending on price cushion.  

GST on all petroleum products up by 2-3pc and commissions for dealers and OMCs by 23-25pc 

According to a notification issued by the Ministry of Finance, the ex-depot price of petrol was fixed at Rs140.82 per litre instead of Rs145.82 at present, down by Rs5 per litre, or 3.42pc. The GST rate on petrol was increased by 3.14pc to 4.77pc. The product is mostly used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws and two-wheelers and has a direct bearing on the budget of middle- and lower-middle classes.  
The ex-depot price of HSD was set at Rs137.62 per litre instead of the existing rate of Rs142.62 per litre, down by Rs5, or 3.50pc. The rate of GST on diesel was increased by about 2pc to 9.08pc. HSD price is considered highly inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains, buses, trucks and agricultural engines like tractors, tube-wells and threshers.  
The ex-depot price of kerosene was reduced to Rs109.53 per litre from Rs116.53, a reduction of Rs7 per litre, or 6pc. The GST on kerosene was slightly increased by 0.10pc to 8.3pc. Kerosene is mostly used by unscrupulous elements for mixing it with petrol and to some extent for lighting in very remote areas.  
The ex-depot price of light diesel oil (LDO) was reduced to Rs107.06 from Rs114.07 per litre, down Rs7 or 6.15pc. The rate of GST on LDO was jacked up by 2.65pc to 2.70pc. LDO is consumed by flour mills and a couple of power plants  
Officials said the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority had recommended Rs10.30 per litre reduction in the ex-depot price of petrol and about Rs8.65 per liter decrease in the ex-depot price of HSD on the basis of all existing factors. However, the finance ministry added higher commissions for dealers and OMCs as implementation of the cabinet decision about the increase had been delayed. It also added GST rates on all products.  
This is the first price reduction after September 1 when the price of petrol and HSD stood at Rs118.30 and Rs115.03 per litre, respectively. The prices have since been going up.  
The government has given an undertaking to the international Monetary Fund to increase petroleum levy on petrol and HSD by Rs4 per litre every month to attain Rs30per litre maximum permissible under the law.  
Until last year, the government charged up to Rs30 per litre petroleum levy on HSD and petrol and Rs6-8 per litre on kerosene and light diesel.  
The petrol and HSD are two major products that generate most of revenue for the government because of their massive and yet growing consumption in the country. Average petrol sales are touching 750,000 tonnes per month against the monthly consumption of around 800,000 tonnes of HSD. The sales of kerosene and LDO are generally less than 11,000 and 2,000 tonnes per month, respectively.  
Under the revised mechanism, oil prices are revised by the government on a fortnightly basis to pass on impact of international prices published in Platt’s Oilgram instead of previous mechanism of monthly calculations on the basis of import cost of Pakistan State Oil.

5,US creating special envoy to combat Islamophobia,"The bill was the brainchild of Ilhan Omar, one of three Muslim members, and Jan Schakowsky, a Jewish white woman","WASHINGTON: The US House of Representatives has passed legislation requiring the State Department to create a special envoy for monitoring and combating Islamophobia. 
The final vote on Tuesday night was along party lines as 219 Democrats voted for the legislation while 212 Republicans voted against. The bill now goes to the Senate. 
The special envoy would also report state-sponsored Islamophobic violence and impunity in the State Department’s annual human rights reports. 
The bill was the brainchild of two lawmakers: Ilhan Omar, one of three Muslim House members frequently subjected to hate speech and death threats; and Jan Schakowsky, a 77-year-old Jewish white woman from the Chicago suburbs. 

The bill was the brainchild of Ilhan Omar, one of three Muslim members, and Jan Schakowsky, a Jewish white woman 

The move to create an office to monitor worldwide Islamophobia followed remarks by a Republican lawmaker Lauren Boebert who depicted Ms Omar as a Muslim terrorist. 
A summary of the bill says that the special envoy will “help policymakers better understand the interconnected, global problem of anti-Muslim bigotry”. It will also establish a “comprehensive strategy for establishing US leadership in combating Islamophobia worldwide”. 
Congresswoman Schakowsky, who not only co-sponsored the bill but also ran a vigorous campaign to get it adopted, said she did so because she did not want Muslims to be targeted because of their faith. 
“We have seen in so many ways — in my community, and in the Congress of the United States — what we know is happening all around the world, and that is increased incidents of dramatic Islamophobia,” she told reporters. “Not just people saying bad things to each other, but all the way on the spectrum toward violence.” 
During the congressional debate, Ms Schakowsky said that more than 500 incidents of Islamophobia had been documented in the United States alone. 
“These are close to home, but it’s also happening around the world,” she said. “The UN Human Rights Council has described hatred towards Muslims at an epidemic proportion right now. This is happening everywhere.” 
Earlier on Tuesday, floor debate of the bill ground to a halt after a Republican congressman, Scott Perry, referred to Ms Omar as anti-Semitic and implied that she had ties to terrorist organisations. 
Mr Perry also argued that a lack of definition for the word “Islamophobia” in the bill would allow individual lawmakers to interpret the legislation in accordance with their “political proclivities”. 
He claimed that the bill was “creating an office in the State Department that will likely spew anti-Semitic hatred and attack Western ideas throughout the world under the farce of protecting Islam,” he said. 
Democrats -- furious at his remarks -- immediately lodged a formal objection and asked Mr Perry’s comments be stricken from the record. 
The vote on Omar’s bill comes just a few weeks after video emerged showing Boebert calling Omar a member of a “Jihad squad” and claimed that a Capitol Police officer thought she was a suicide bomber in an encounter in an elevator on Capitol Hill. 
Later, Ms Boebert apologised on Twitter “to anyone in the Muslim community I offended”. 
Congresswoman Schakowsky, however, warned that such “attacks on the Other that’s going on way too often in the United States is pretty devastating to our democracy and to the historic values of our country”. 
She said that “anti-Semitism and Islamophobia are really all of one piece and showed a divide that really does threaten all of us. This degree of hatred and violence and threats is unprecedented”, she noted.
