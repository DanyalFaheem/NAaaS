0,RED ZONE FILES: Songs outside  the marquee,The slush of the wedding season will drain out over the weeks and drag the focus back to partisan politicking.,"As we all wade knee-deep through the slush of the wedding season, politics outside the marquees is resonating to an uncertain beat. The power matrix tells its own story from inside the Red Zone. Here goes: 

Today’s date is seared into our collective memory. Six years ago the heart-wrenching tragedy of the APS Peshawar attack happened on this day. Fifty years ago, Pakistan lost its eastern wing on this day. Both events have had a lasting impact on the nation’s politics and psyche, and both continue to shape and reshape our national discourse with the ebb and flow of time. The APS issue has picked up momentum with the parents of the martyred students appealing to the Supreme Court and the court summoning Prime Minister Imran Khan to explain why action hasn’t been taken against senior officials. However officials insist that all the terrorists who were directly involved in the attack have been arrested and brought to justice. 
The larger question though remains open to debate: has Pakistan done all that it had vowed to do through the National Action Plan? There is no doubt that post-APS Pakistan swung into action and succeeded in smashing the TTP network on home soil. The terror infrastructure was uprooted, thousands of perpetrators apprehended or killed in operations and TTP’s ability to launch attacks across the country severely degraded. It was a remarkable success in more ways than one, exemplified by the single-minded focus of the military and the massive support of public opinion that had overwhelmingly turned against TTP and other terror outfits after the APS tragedy. However, the National Action Plan gradually lost momentum and many of the long-term strategies fell by the wayside. The resurgence of the TTP threat — still at a very nascent stage — should re-focus attention on the plan and how the state must get back in the saddle and finish what it had promised to do us six years ago. 
The fifty-year mark of the truncation of Pakistan and the birth of Bangladesh remains one of the darkest chapters in our seven-decade long history. However, this year the state is pushing aggressively against the established narrative of that period in a bid to reframe the discourse — to the extent possible — so that history can be reviewed and re-interpreted from another angle. Burning questions of that day — casualty figures, issue of Biharis, role of India, motives of the East Pakistan leaders and of course the decisions, oh those decisions, of the West Pakistan leaders — all these are now under a fresh microscope. It is hard to tell what will find traction and what will not, but five decades is a long enough time for all stakeholders to be able to take a relatively dispassionate look at those momentous events and draw the right conclusions that can chart a better course for the next fifty years. 
These weighty issues weigh not that much on the political scale as the news cycle jumps from one issue to another in the absence of an oversized topic that usually devours national attention. The latest in a long line of tactical controversies this week has been the controversy triggered by the competing and quasi-contrasting statements of PML-N leaders Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and Mohammad Zubair. The media lapped up the juicy controversy — wedding season does starve the media for meaty political stories — and played it up for the analysts to sink their teeth into it and tear off a thick chunk. But there’s much that has been missed by most who are commenting on the matter. 
The way the controversy is being framed is thus: Shahid Abbasi said Shehbaz Sharif is the party’s candidate for the prime minister in the next elections while Zubair refused to be so categorical and said Maryam Nawaz’s cases are very weak and once she is cleared of them she will be eligible to run for elections. The insinuation being read into this is that she will therefore be eligible to be the party’s choice for the next prime minister. What has added fuel to this fire is the well-established difference of narrative between Shehbaz and Maryam Nawaz and how it continues to divide the party rank and file even as elections draw near. 
There is clearly an element of ambiguity ingrained within this issue. According to Red Zone insiders however, the ambiguity is nothing new. What may be new is the relative clarity with which Shahid Abbasi answered the question. However, his answer is strictly not wrong. Shehbaz is in fact the president of the party and this automatically makes him the obvious choice for the prime minister’s office if the party wins the elections. The other aspirant, Maryam Nawaz, currently stands disqualified and therefore at this point cannot be the candidate. Shahid Abbasi could have been evasive with the answer. The fact that he chose not is perhaps one reason why the issue flared up. We demand clarity and when we get it, we complain. 
Mohammad Zubair also did not deny what Shahid Abbasi said but added an opinion that Maryam Nawaz may be qualified to run for elections in 2023 (or whenever the polls take place). He did not say she would be the candidate for the prime minister’s office but that she would most likely be able to run for a seat in the parliament. The headlines went a bit further than what he had actually said and pegged the issue on the sense of what he had said. The sense may be correct, possibly, but his words did not spell this literally. The controversy therefore is a bit unfair on both the gentlemen. 
But it does not take away from the fact that the simmering duality within the party will need to be addressed at some point before the elections. Party insiders say there is now a growing body of opinion within the rank and file that Shehbaz’s candidature would ease PML-N’s journey back to power. However, the same people who argue this also acknowledge that Maryam Nawaz would have to campaign along with Shehbaz if the party wants to charge up its voter base and get people to come out in large numbers. It is the ideal combination, but it is far from turning into a reality. 
This reality will need to be forged by one man sitting in London. So far he has not spoken his mind. However, according to insiders, there is now a gentle move afoot to nudge the leader to make a decision. The senior leadership of the party is getting more vocal that indecision is costing the party precious time and bleeding precious political capital at a time when a timely decision can open up opportunities in the short term also. 
The slush of the wedding season will drain out over the weeks and drag the focus back to partisan politicking. The PML-N has allowed itself the opportunity to deck up and sway to the songs of matrimonial bliss. The shimmering dresses and sparkling smiles may have disguised the edginess that lurks within its ranks, but the time is not far off when the party will need to return to the question that haunts it most. 

If it cannot address the question with the clarity and seriousness it deserves, then the last people to face the blame should be Shahid Abbasi and Mohammad Zubair.

2,Pakistan prepares over Rs11bn package for Afghan students,President Dr Arif Alvi vows to help Kabul in the higher education sector.,"ISLAMABAD: As part of the assistance package to the nascent Afghan government, Pakistan has decided in principle to offer thousands of scholarships to Afghan students, besides opening a campus of Allama Iqbal Open University (AIOU) in Kabul. 
In this regard, the Ministry of Education and Professional Training has finalised a Rs11.2 billion package to improve the education sector and skill development in the war-torn country. 
According to sources in the ministry, the amount will be spent for offering scholarships to 3,000 Afghan students in Pakistani universities, free training with stipend to 5,000 Afghan nationals for skills development in Islamabad, free training to 150 Afghan teachers, 100 nursing diploma scholarships and establishment of regional campus of AIOU in Kabul. 

Alvi vows to help Kabul in higher education sector

The sources said a summary had already been sent to Prime Minister Imran Khan for approval of the package. The ministry has finalised the package on the directive of Minister for Education Shafqat Mahmood after a last week meeting between the Pakistani officials and a Afghan delegation headed by Minister for Higher Education Maulana Abdul Baqi Haqqani. The eight-member delegation is currently visiting Pakistan and has already visited various subordinate organisations of the education ministry, including the HEC. 
Last month, Prime Minister Khan approved Rs5 billion humanitarian aid for Afghanistan, besides allowing transportation of Indian food assistance for the country through Pakistan. 
Pakistan is also hosting an extraordinary session of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation’s foreign ministers in Islamabad to highlight the plight of the Afghan people who have been facing a tough and testing time. 
Meanwhile, during a meeting with the Afghan delegation on Wednesday, President Dr Arif Alvi said Pakistan would assist Afghanistan in digital transformation of its varsities and provide online education to its students. 
The president said that AIOU and Virtual University (VU) of Pakistan had been directed to help the university students in Afghanistan. Besides, the president said, the National Vocational and Technical Training Commission would arrange vocational training programmes for the Afghan people in various fields. 
President Alvi said Pakistan would continue to provide all possible assistance to Afghanistan for development of its education sector and capacity-building of its educational institutions.  
The president said Afghanistan was passing through a very difficult phase and urged the international community to provide economic and humanitarian aid to save the country from a possible human catastrophe. 
During the meeting, the two sides agreed to increase collaboration between higher education institutions of the two countries. 
The visiting Afghan minister thanked the Pakistan government for its role in the reconstruction and education development of Afghanistan. He termed meetings with the Pakistani leadership very fruitful. 
The Afghan delegation met the president on the day PM Khan presided over the second meeting of Apex Committee on Afghanistan which was also attended by Chief of the Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa.

3,"Seminaries undergoing transformational change, seminar told",Speakers urge seminaries to devise strategies that emphasise importance of unity in a bid to play down divisions or rifts.,"ISLAMABAD: Seminaries in Pakistan are undergoing a transformational change, but while this appears to be a good omen, there is a growing feeling among the madressahs that they are getting away from their roots.  
The speakers at a seminar held here on Wednesday said that the seminaries needed to devise strategies that emphasised the importance of unity in a bid to play down divisions or rifts.  
The seminar was organised by the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) in collaboration with the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS), Islamabad, and Darul Ilm-wal-Tehqeeq, Karachi. The session also featured the launch of the latest publication on the subject by Islamic scholar Dr Syed Azizur Rahman titled ‘Deeni Madaris Badalte Hue Zamane Main’.  
Barrister Zafarullah Khan, the prime minister’s former special assistant on law, said the religious education must be in tune with the changing times. “It becomes important to look beyond one’s preconceived beliefs and thoughts.”  
Barrister Khan also called upon the students and teachers at seminaries to give importance to research works in religious education. He said that the students of seminaries should get themselves acquainted with ancient and modern traditions and history.  
Dr Azizur Rahman, of the IPS-National Academic Council, said the thought of keeping up with modern societal needs had always prevailed in madressahs but the transition had been slow and gradual due to their deep-rooted connections with conventions and traditions.  
However, he added, while there had been changes in curricula and teaching styles of Dars-i-Nizami, there had also been improvement in the general atmosphere of madressahs as well as more acceptance towards needed reforms.  
Dr Rahman said the prime objective of religious education should not be seen as a mean to earn livelihood, adding that earning of a living should be a secondary objective for the seminary students.  
CII secretary Dr Ikram-ul-Haq Yaseen highlighted that during the British rule seminaries were deliberately kept away from economic and administrative matters and reduced to providing only basic learning of Islam. “But a religious scholar should be a good preacher as well as a dynamic person of society,” he said.  
IPS vice chairman Syed Abrar Hussain pointed out that the government had played a key part in determining how the role of religious institutions was seen in the country. He said the seminaries were mostly seen from the lens of security instead of looking at them as traditional educational institutions with deep sociocultural roots.  
Highlighting the achievements of seminary students related to conventional education, Dr Nazir Ahmed Vaid, a religious scholar, said madressahs had started attaining modern education and technology.

4,Sacking case: govt moots reinstatement of low grade employees,A large number of employees gathered outside the Supreme Court and raised slogans like “we want justice”.,"ISLAMABAD: Attorney General (AGP) Khalid Jawed Khan presented a set of proposals on behalf of the federal government in the sacked employees case to the Supreme Court on Wednesday. 
The government has proposed that the employees in lower grades be reinstated forthwith while those in higher grades go through the recruitment procedure of the Federal Public Service Commission (FPSC) afresh. 
A five-judge Supreme Court bench is hearing a set of petitions seeking review of an Aug 17 judgement that rendered almost 17,000 government employees jobless. The court dropped hints that it could wrap up the issue on  Thursday (today). 
On the eve of his retirement, Justice Mushir Alam had on Aug 17 declared as illegal and unconstitutional a PPP-era law, known as the Sacked Employees (Reinstatement) Ordinance Act 2010 (SERA), under which a large number of people were employed or promoted. 
Asked what proposals the government intended to put in place, the AGP explained that he wanted to reiterate his primary submission that the Aug 17 judgement be recalled and all the employees reinstated. 
And in case the apex court refuses to review the judgement, Khalid Jawed added, the government has thrashed out a four-point proposal and placed it before the bench. The government has proposed that employees from BS-1 to 7, or equivalent, and working in departments, autonomous bodies or corporations before the Aug 17 judgement, be allowed to continue their services with effect from Wednesday (Dec 15) in the light of the apex court’s previous verdicts. 
The employees from Grade 1 to 7 are the most affected and it is heart-breaking to see them protesting on the streets, the AGP lamented. 
A large number of employees from different parts of the country gathered outside the Supreme Court on Wednesday and raised slogans like “we want justice”.
According to data provided by the Establishment Division, the number of employees sacked by 38 divisions of the federal government was 5,947. 
The AGP said he had discussed the proposals with Prime Minister Imran Khan and if the court gave its approval,  the process of implementation would start forthwith.
Employees in BS-8 to 17 will have to undergo a prescribed process or test to be conducted by the Federal Public Service Commission. 
The commission will determine whether these officers are fit to hold the post to which they were appointed earlier. This exercise should be completed within three months, the government proposed. 
The past service of these individuals will be treated as ad hoc and would not be counted for the purpose of seniority, which would be based on the date or regular appointment after recommendation of the FPSC. 
About the employees who have retired from service or passed away, the AGP said their cases may be treated as past and closed transaction. They will not be entitled to pension as their services were never regularised constitutionally, he added. 
Three million lives affected
Abdul Latif Afridi, who represented employees from the Utility Stores Corporation (USC) and the Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL), said the case related not only to the 16,000 sacked employees but also to their three million dependents. 
“Their joblessness with stroke of a pen has created a humanitarian crisis,” he added. 
The counsel said the Supreme Court always invokes its original suo motu jurisdiction in the larger public interest. “These employees are the real public,” Latif Afridi  argued, wondering whether the fundamental rights of only “hattay kattay mottay tazay” (the wealthy and influential) were breached and not of people like those who were on the streets. 
“Was it the fault of these employees if their appointments had procedural lapses,” the counsel argued. 
PSO story
Faisal Siddiqui, who represented the Pakistan State Oil, explained that under a talent pool scheme initiated by the PSO, around 150 persons were employed over two decades ago. But their services were terminated in 1997. 
However, 44 of them were reinstated with back benefits by the apex court after holding their termination illegal. The remaining cases were dismissed by the Federal Services Tribunal on grounds that their appeals were premature and had not exhausted departmental remedies. 
The counsel argued that none of the sacked employees were reinstated under SERA and neither the PSO nor any of the employees was a party in the Aug 17 judgement, but the organisation sacked all the employees reinstated under SERA through an Aug 31 circular.
The order deprived the employees of their provident funds, gratuity, medical allowances and pensions on the grounds that the Aug 17 court verdict said payments made over three years were to be recovered in lump sum. 
Faisal Siddiqui said legislation conferring rights or imposing liability cannot be struck down for not mentioning logical and precise reasons of the law from the text of the statute. 
A statute can only be struck down if it is found to be arbitrary, capricious or whimsical, the counsel contended. 
Citing previous judgements, Faisal Siddiqui said a piece of legislation cannot be struck down on the grounds that objects and reasons were not clearly stated. Since there were no victims of discrimination in the cases like that of the PSO, SERA cannot be described as ex facie discriminatory, but only discriminatory in practice and, therefore, cannot be held illegal.
He contended that the legislature can nullify the effect of a judgement both in terms of its precedent value as well as the rights accrued to the respective parties under the judgement if it can remove the defect on the basis of which the judgement was pronounced.
He observed that no termination could take place without show-cause proceedings and in the present case the employees were dismissed through an omnibus order.

5,"Trade activities at Chaman and Taftan borders, Quetta Dry Port suspended",Protest being taken out against alleged misconduct of Customs Intelligence.,"QUETTA: All business activities, including import and export, remained suspended at Quetta Dry Port and Chaman and Taftan border crossings with Afghanistan and Iran, respectively, on Wednesday as traders observed protest against alleged misconduct of Customs Intelligence. 
The Quetta Chamber of Commerce and Industry (QCCI) had announced the other day that the businessmen would suspend trade activities at Quetta Dry Port and Chaman and Taftan border crossings to protest against taking the trucks loaded with dried and fresh fruits into custody and misconduct of Customs Intelligence officials with the traders and drivers. 
President of the chamber Fida Hussain Dashti told the media that the protest would be extended to other parts of the province and it would continue till the transfer of the director of Customs Intelligence, Balochistan, Mohammad Ismail. 
He said Mr Ismail had been given the additional charge in 2020 and the traders had filed a petition against him on which the Balochistan High Court had restricted him from registering cases against the importers and exporters of dried and fresh fruits. 
However, Mr Dashti said, trucks laden with fruits and having required documents were still being stopped by the customs officials  due to which the government and the customs department were facing losses and there was uneasiness among the importers and the exporters.  
He said the drivers of trucks stuck at the dry port and the border crossing were also facing difficulties due to the strike.
