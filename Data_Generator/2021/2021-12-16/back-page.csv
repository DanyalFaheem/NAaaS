0,"NCOC, education ministry differ over winter vacations",Students have been running a campaign on social media demanding early vacations.,"ISLAMABAD: The National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) and the federal education ministry, it seems, are not on the same page regarding winter vacation in educational institutions, as the former at its meeting on Wednesday recommended the vacation start in the middle of January, a day after the federal education minister announced the holidays would commence on Dec 25. 
Following the NCOC recommendation, the ministry kept silent on the issue and did not announce a date.  
Federal Education Minister Shafqat Mahmood had after a meeting of the education secretaries on Tuesday announced that the winter vacation would start on Dec 25. 
“Federal and provincial secretaries met today [Tuesday]. The agreed proposal was that winter holidays should be from Dec 25 to Jan 4. Further notifications will be made by the governments concerned,” Shafqat Mahmood tweeted on Tuesday, which was also reported in the media. 

 



 

Students running a campaign on social media for early vacations 

But the NCOC meeting on Wednesday recommended the vacation be postponed till the second or third week of January so that the ongoing vaccination campaign in educational institutions could be completed. 
A senior officer in the education ministry said that earlier the ministry and secretaries had agreed upon Dec 25 as the date to begin winter vacation, but the NCOC did not agree to it. 
“A decision regarding the winter vacation will likely be made [on Thursday] by the federal education minister, who before making any decision will talk to Planning Minister and NCOC head Asad Umar and Health Minister Dr Faisal Sultan,” the officer said. 
The Sindh government has already announced winter holidays in all educational institutions of the province from Dec 20 to Jan 3. 
Meanwhile, students have been running a campaign on social media demanding early vacations. The federal education minister is once again the subject of a barrage of memes on social media, with students requesting him for early winter holidays. Earlier, the minister faced a similar situation online on the exam issue.

1,EU ramps up Covid vaccine drive for children,The effort has been lent fresh urgency by the rapid spread of the heavily mutated Omicron variant.,"MADRID: Europe step­ped up vaccinations of children aged five to 11 against Covid-19 on Wednesday, as the EU’s health agency warned that immunisation alone would not stop the rapid rise of the Omicron variant of the virus. 
Croatia, Germany, Greece, Hungary and Spain were among those opening up their inoculation drives to younger kids, with other nations still weighing their approach. 
At Hospital Principe de Asturias in Alcala de Henares near Madrid, nurses wearing Christmas antler headbands welcomed children and gave them stickers after their shots. 
“It only hurt a little,” said 11-year-old Magdalena Lazo Vitoria as she left the vaccination centre, a plaster on her left shoulder. 
“I wasn’t nervous because I wanted to get vaccinated for a long time now, so I am really happy.” 
The push was lent fresh urgency by the rapid spread of the heavily mutated Omicron variant, which EU chief Ursula von der Leyen warned could be dominant in Europe by mid-January. 
Even as children lined up to get jabs, the EU health agency ECDC said measures like mask-wearing, distance working and the prevention of crowds were essential to reduce the burden on healthcare systems in the time available, with vaccines alone taking too long. 
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said he hoped his country, which already has one of Europe’s highest Covid-19 vaccination rates, would become an “example for the world” with its immunisation campaign for five- to 11-year-olds. 
The country has around 3.3 million children in that age group. Doctors across Europe reported strong initial demand from parents. 
“As soon as we offered the vaccine appointments, they were pretty much all snapped up,” said Jakob Maske, a Berlin-based doctor and spokesman for Germany’s association of paediatricians. 
Germany’s STIKO vaccine commission has officially only recommended the jab for children with pre-existing conditions, but even healthy children will be inoculated if the parents request it. 
Some German cities plan to administer kids’ jabs in museums and zoos, while others are considering mobile vaccination teams outside schools. 
While serious illness and death from Covid among children are rare, those infected can pass the virus to other people at higher risk of serious illness, such as the elderly. 
The EU’s medicines wat­chdog last month approved the Pfizer-BioNTech shot for five- to 11-year-olds, an age group experiencing high coronavirus infection rates.

2,"PM Imran stresses green urbanisation to reduce pollution, smog","Orders fast-paced land transfer for Ravi riverfront, business district projects.","ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday directed the Punjab government to take legal action against the elements involved in encroachments and building illegal housing societies. 
While chairing a meeting on the Ravi Riverfront Urban Development Project and Central Business District (CBD) Lahore, the prime minister emphasised the use of environment-friendly material, including smart trees, blue roads and energy-efficient construction material, on these projects. 
He was of the view that both the projects were important for the future of Lahore as well as the country, ordering that green urbanisation models be replicated in all cities to reduce pollution. Development projects helped improve socio-economic conditions of the common people, he remarked. 
“Green urbanisation will help in reducing the adverse impact of pollution and these models should be replicated in other cities of the country,” he added. 

Orders fast-paced land transfer for Ravi riverfront, business district projects  

The prime minister said development of green spaces in new plans and their preservation in the existing urban areas was necessary for mitigating the impact of pollution, including smog. He directed the authorities to expedite the process of land transfer for both the riverfront and business district projects. 
The prime minister further emphasised that urban development projects were being initiated to attract investments and should not be criticised and hindered for political reasons. 
Earlier, the meeting was apprised that physical work on the two projects was under way in full swing and the land acquisition process was near completion. It was informed that Rs100 billion investment was expected for the CBD in the first year, and 1,900 low-cost housing units included in the master plan of the Ravi riverfront scheme. 
The meeting was attended, among others, by federal Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry, the PM’s Adviser on Finance Shaukat Tarin, Special Assistant to the PM Dr Shahbaz Gill, Naya Pakistan Housing and Development Authority Chairman retired Lt Gen Anwar Ali Haider and the Punjab chief secretary. 
Later Board of Investment (BOI) chairman Ahsan Azfar called on Prime Minister Imran Khan. The PM sought suggestions for appointment of the BOI’s board of directors. 
The PM suggested methods for the appointment of directors and gave directives to comply with all the measures discussed during the briefing. The prime minister was given a briefing on the ongoing reforms and restructuring in the BoI.

3,US forensics firm confirms it inspected audiotape sent by Pakistani TV channel,Report claims ARY News asked Primeau Forensics to do a forensic analysis of an audio leak of former chief justice Saqib Nisar.,"WASHINGTON: Primeau Forensics, a US forensic audit company, confirmed on Wednesday it had inspected an audiotape forwarded by a Pakistani television channel, but said it could not share details of its report with the media.  
“It was a specific thing that we did for our client and we are not discussing it with anyone,” a company representative told Dawn. “We have no press release.”  
He said the client, ARY News, had the report and “only they can share the details with others”.  
A report released in Islamabad claimed that ARY News had asked Primeau Forensics to do a forensic analysis of an audio leak of the former chief justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar.  
In this audio, two persons can be heard discussing cases against PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz. Reports in the Pakistani media claimed that one of the persons was Mr Nisar, the former chief justice.  

Refuses to divulge details of its report

According to ARY News, the audit of this 45-second file showed two “reverberences” in the voice as the person spoke from two different locations. The voice was clearer during the last 20 seconds as it came from a closer range.  
ARY News claimed that when it asked Primeau Forensics if the recording was of the original conversation or came from an edited tape, the company said the two parts of 20 and 25 seconds each were recorded in a different environment.  
The company told ARY News that it believed “the unknown Fact Focus clip was generated from at least two different sources”.  
They observed “two different reverberences, indicating that the first portion of the audio was likely recorded in a different environment than the second portion”.  
Primeau Forensics is based in Rochester Hills, Michigan.  A post on its website says that its experts have processed over 5,000 audio, video and image forensic investigations and provided expert testimony in over 500 cases in local, state and federal courts.  
It claims to have 30 years of experience in this field, working for attorney generals of multiple US States, CNN, AP and other major organisations. ARY News claimed that it had paid Rs1 million for the audit.

4,SNGPL suspends gas supply to captive power plants,Decision taken as per approved load management programme to continue uninterrupted gas supply to domestic consumers.,"LAHORE: The Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd (SNGPL) has suspended gas supply to captive power plants (CPPs) due to an increased consumption by domestic consumers.
A press release issued by the company on Wednesday said since the gas demand in the domestic sector had increased significantly due to severe cold weather, supply to CPPs had been suspended from 9pm on Wednesday (Dec 15). 
The decision has been taken as per the approved load management programme, it said, to continue uninterrupted gas supply to domestic consumers.
It has, however, requested domestic consumers to use gas only when required and turn to electric heaters and geysers instead of gas-run devices. It also urged the consumers to avoid using compressors to suck in gas as it deprives other users of their rights.

5,Karzai says he invited Taliban into Kabul to protect its people,Karzai was adamant that there would have been an agreement for a peaceful transition had Ashraf Ghani remained in Kabul.,"KABUL: The Taliban didn’t take the Afghan capital, they were invited, says the man who reportedly issued the invitation. 
In an interview, former Afghan president Hamid Karzai offered some of the first insights into the secret and sudden departure of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and how he came to invite the Taliban into the city to protect the population so that the country doesn’t fall into chaos. 
When Ghani left, his security officials also left. Defence minister Bismillah Khan even asked Karzai if he wanted to leave Kabul when Karzai contacted him to know what remnants of the government still remained. It turned out there were none. Not even the Kabul police chief had remained. 
Karzai, who was the country’s president for 13 years after the Taliban were first ousted in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, refused to leave. 
In a wide-ranging interview at his tree-lined compound in the centre of the city where he lives with his wife and young children, Karzai was adamant that Ghani’s flight scuttled a last-minute plan focused on the Taliban’s entry into the capital. 
He and Abdullah, the government’s chief negotiator, had been working with the Taliban leadership in Doha on a negotiated agreement to allow the militia to enter the capital under controlled conditions. The countdown to a possible deal began on Aug 14, the day before the Taliban came to power. 
Karzai and Abdullah met Ghani, and they agreed that they would leave for Doha the next day with a list of 15 others to negotiate a power-sharing agreement. The Taliban were already on the outskirts of Kabul, but Karzai said the leadership in Qatar promised the insurgent force would remain outside the city until the deal was struck. 
Early on the morning of Aug 15, Karzai said, he waited to draw up the list. The capital was fidgety, on edge. Rumours were swirling about a Taliban takeover. Karzai called Doha. He was told the Taliban would not enter the city. 
At noon, the Taliban called to say that “the government should stay in its positions and should not move (as) they have no intention to (go) into the city,” Karzai said. 
By about 2:45pm, though, it became apparent Ghani had fled the city. Karzai called the defence minister, called the interior minister, searched for the Kabul police chief. Everyone was gone. 
Ghani’s own protection unit’s deputy chief called Karzai to come to the palace and take over the presidency. He declined, saying legally he had no right to the job. Instead the former president decided “to make a public, televised message, with his children at his side so that the Afghan people know that we are all here”. 
Karzai was adamant that there would have been an agreement for a peaceful transition had Ghani remained in Kabul. 
Today, Karzai regularly meets members of the Taliban leadership and says the world must engage with them. “Equally important,” he said, “is that Afghans have to come together”.
He added: “An end to that can only come when Afghans get together, find their own way out.”
