0,"Ton-up Iftikhar, Kamran help KP recover from early jolts in QAT final",Northern pacer Waqas Ahmed uprooted Fakhar Zaman’s off-stump with a delivery that swung back into the left-hander.,"KARACHI: It was only the second over and defending champions Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were reeling in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy final. 
Northern pacer Waqas Ahmed was getting early afternoon swing at the National Stadium on Saturday and uprooted Fakhar Zaman’s off-stump with a delivery that swung back into the left-hander.
The very next ball, Sahibzada Farhan was trapped lbw with a delivery that swung late and Waqas was on a hat-trick with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at 6-2.
Kamran Ghulam prevented him from getting a hat-trick before becoming the pivot for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s recovery.
His obdurate 72 off 196 deliveries was key as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reached 252-5 at stumps on the opening day of the pink-ball day/night final on Saturday.
Iftikhar Ahmed got more runs than Kamran, and made 102 but it was the latter who frustrated the Northern bowlers with his mean defence and kept one end intact.
After the early blows, Kamran combined with his captain Ashfaq Ahmed (45) in a 79-run partnership which was broken when Mohammad Huraira took scooped a catch at the second attempt at short fine leg off Mubasir Khan.
Ashfaq hit five fours during his innings and after he departed, Kamran and Iftikhar added 104 runs with the former blocking out the Northern bowlers.
Kamran hit 11 fours, only getting out when he tried to hit Mohammad Nawaz out of the park. He came down the wicket to the Pakistan spin all-rounder and completely missed the ball to be stumped by Rohail Nazir.
Iftikhar, on the other hand, was getting runs more quickly and completed his century off 168 deliveries with his 13th boundary, driving Kashif Ali between mid-off and extra cover.
He was gone soon after when Waqas had him bowled between bat and pad. 
At the close of play, Rehan Afridi was at 23 not out, sharing a 60-run partnership with Iftikhar, while Asif Afridi was unbeaten on three with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, who shared the title with Central Punjab after last year’s final ended in a draw, looking well-placed to retain the title.

1,Fancied Sahil gallops to victory in Quaid-e-Azam Gold Cup,KARACHI: Justifying his credentials incumbent Derby winner and public fancy four-year old bay colt Sahil achieved...,"KARACHI: Justifying his credentials incumbent Derby winner and public fancy four-year old bay colt Sahil achieved another feat when he galloped to a fascinating eight lengths victory over four-year old bay colt Shorawak to lift the showpiece event of Karachi Race Club (KRC) — the Quaid-e-Azam Gold Cup — at the Karachi Racecourse on Saturday.
It is pertinent to mention here that Sahil had defeated Shorawak, formerly Governor, in this year’s Derby also.
The 50 to 100 thoroughbred horse overtook front-runners one by one before surging ahead at the bend and kicked up speed in home stretch to win hands down.
The packed to capacity stand greeted the victorious horse by giving him a standing ovation as he entered the paddock with celebrated jockey Aftab Chaudhry in the saddle.
“I was confident of completing a double — Derby and Quaid-e-Azam Gold Cup — the same year and I proved it,” an elated Aftab told Dawn. He had accomplished this feat in 2019 as well.  
Lahore-based Aftab had alre­ady achieved a rare honour of completing a hat-trick on the same horse (Big Bravo) in the Quaid-e-Azam Gold Cup from 2017 to 2019.
Defending champion bay horse Royal Ransom had to be content with the third place falling four lengths behind while Big Faith completed the frame edged by head. Both the horses are from the same pedigree as Sahil.
Winning owner of Sahil, Kha­waja M. Atif received a purse of Rs0.7 million and the glittering trophy from Sindh Governor Imran Ismail alongside KRC president Syed Sadruddin Shah amid appla­use. A total amount of over Rs3 million was at stake in the day’s races.
The 2000 Guineas of Pakistan ended in a blaze of glory for bay colt Fantastico after favourite and front-runner Warrior’s Call became lame while negotiating the bend.   
Favourite filly Queen’s Pride clinched the Nursery Cup by getting the better of American Gangster by two-and-a-half lengths in a start to finish bid.
Another favourite bay colt Chu­r­chill obliged all and sundry impo­sing to three lengths victory over G Sarkar to annex the X-Mas Cup.
Yet another favourite filly Chile repeated her winning feat registering seven lengths victory over Regardless to win the M. Rasheed Jung Memorial Cup.
A trio of riders — Aftab, Zaki Zakir and Sohail Ahmed — excelled in their cadres by piloting home a brace of winners apiece.
Ace trainer Ghulam Shabbir II partnered a treble while owners M/s Syed Ismail Shah and Ham­mad Farooq Fikri completed a double namely the Nursery Cup and the X-Mas Cup.

2,Injured Raonic withdraws from Australian Open,MELBOURNE: Canadian Milos Raonic has pulled out of next month’s Australian Open as the former world number three...,"MELBOURNE: Canadian Milos Raonic has pulled out of next month’s Australian Open as the former world number three continues his recovery from a heel injury, the organisers said on Saturday.
Raonic suffered a thigh injury in March and returned to the tour after a three-month gap. But his 2021 season was cut short due to another heel issue following his first-round loss at the Atlanta Open in July.
“Milos Raonic has withdrawn from the #AusOpen as he continues his recovery from an Achilles injury,” the organisers of the Grand Slam said on Twitter.
Raonic, who turns 31 on Monday, reached a career-high world ranking of third in 2016 -- the year he reached the finals at Wimbledon and made a run to the semi-finals at Melbourne Park.
The Canadian, who has currently slipped to 70th, is the latest to be ruled out of the Australian Open, with Roger Federer, Stan Wawrinka, Jennifer Brady, Karolina Pliskova, Karolina Muchova, Serena Williams and Bianca Andreescu also ruled out with injuries.

Naushad Ali scored the all-important goal in the dying moments of the keenly contested title clash.
It was indeed a good effort of Karachi Hockey Association (KHA), Sindh Rangers and sponsors who contributed their share to revive the national game at the grassroots level as it has witnessed a slump for well over a decade.
The recent showings of both senior and junior national teams in the Men’s Asian Champions Trophy and the Junior World Cup has put the heads down of former Olympians, internationals and lovers of the game.
District East, who are also reigning Sindh Inter-district champions, received winning purse of Rs0.6million and a trophy while the runners-up fetched Rs0.3 million.
Abdul Wahab of District West won the best player of the tournament award while Abdul Rafay and Nouman Khanzada, both from District East, won best goalkeeper and top scorer award, respectively. All three were presented with brand new motorcycles.
The best player of the final award went to Naushad.
DG Rangers Sindh Maj Gen Iftikhar Hassan Chau­dhary, who witnessed the final for some time, gave away the prizes along with other dignitaries.

7,"England make four changes, Boland to debut for Australia",Zak Crawley recalled for the first time since March to replace struggling opener Rory Burns.,"MELBOURNE: Embattled England made four changes on Saturday for the crunch Boxing Day Test in a bid to keep the Ashes alive, while Australia handed experienced seamer Scott Boland a surprise debut.
Joe Root’s team must win at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in front of an expected 70,000 fans to stay in the hunt after heavy defeats in the first two Tests at Brisbane and Adelaide and with three still to play.
Those losses were characterised by batting collapses compounded by poor bowling and fielding with the visitors looking to stop the rot by shaking up the team.
Zak Crawley was recalled for the first time since March to replace struggling opener Rory Burns, despite averaging just 28.34 from his 15 Tests.
Veteran Jonny Bairstow, meanwhile, will add to his 78 Tests when he takes over at number six from youngster Ollie Pope, who has failed to adapt to the Australian conditions.
England also mixed up the bowling unit again with speedster Mark Wood returning after being rested for their 275-run defeat in Adelaide, which followed a nine wicket thrashing in Brisbane.
Off-spinner Jack Leach also gets another chance after being axed for the second Test despite the Adelaide pitch having plenty in it for the slow bowlers.
Chris Woakes and Stuart Broad were overlooked in an attack that will be led by veteran quick Jimmy Anderson and Ollie Robinson.
“It’s a massive game for us, but it’s a brilliant venue to play cricket at. Everyone is very excited to be here in what I’m sure will be a hostile environment,” said wicket-keeper Jos Buttler, who keeps the gloves despite Bairstow’s return.
“We know we need to bring our best cricket, we haven’t brought that so far and that’s disappointing.
“The reaction [after Adelaide] has been an honest one,” he added.  “We have a really tight-knit group, some great mates in there, but we had some honest conversations as well.”
Australia are bolstered by the return of captain Pat Cummins, who missed the second Test after being a close contact of a Covid-19 case. He replaces Michael Neser.
But, as expected, fellow pace spearhead Josh Hazlewood will again miss out as he continues to recover from a side strain.
Jhye Richardson, who took five wickets in England’s second innings at Adelaide, is still sore from his efforts with Boland replacing him to become the third Australian debutant this series after Neser and Alex Carey.
In doing so, he also becomes the first Indigenous man to play Test cricket for Australia since Jason Gillespie.
“He was pretty sore,” Cummins told reporters of Richardson, adding that he also had a minor leg injury.
“We were umming and ahhing -- he had a bowl yesterday but we thought seven days off [before the fourth Test in Sydney] will kind of give him enough rest.”
Boland will play on his home ground, where he has taken 91 wickets at 25.71 in 26 first-class games, often on unresponsive pitches.
Cummins said his record at the Melbourne Cricket Ground factored into their thinking.
“It was a huge part of it. His record speaks for itself here in domestic cricket,” he said. “Home ground, having someone fresh like him who can perform straightaway were the big factors.”
Squads:
ENGLAND: Haseeb Hameed, Zak Crawley, Dawid Malan, Joe Root (capt), Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow, Jos Buttler, Mark Wood, Ollie Robinson, Jack Leach, Jimmy Anderson
AUSTRALIA: David Warner, Marcus Harris, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith, Travis Head, Cameron Green, Alex Carey, Pat Cummins (captain), Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, Scott Boland.

8,Kohli’s India seek to conquer final frontier in South Africa,South Africa is the only regular Test-playing nation where India have yet to win a series.,"CENTURION: Virat Kohli bruised from being fired as India’s One-day International captain bids to rebound by leading his country to an historic triumph in South Africa in a three-match Test series which starts at the SuperSport Park in Centurion on Sunday.
South Africa is the only regular Test-playing nation where India have yet to win a series.
“We have worked really hard to win series away from India,” said vice-captain KL Rahul at India’s pre-match press conference on Friday.
“We’ve won series in England and Australia, which gives us a lot of confidence. We haven’t won a series in South Africa, which gives us extra motivation to do our best.”
South African captain Dean Elgar said he thought the teams were evenly matched.
“India are number one in the world for a reason but the fact that we are playing in our own back yard gives as an advantage.” Despite losing to New Zealand in last year’s world Test Championship final, India are the top-ranked Test team, five places ahead of South Africa, who have lost several key players to retirement in recent years.
Kohli leads an experienced side.
Crucially, it has the fast-bowling fire power to match South Africa’s in conditions which usually favour pace.
No fewer than ten of India’s 18-man squad have toured South Africa before.
Kohli, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ishant Sharma, Ravichandran Ashwin, Umesh Yadav and reserve wicket-keeper Wriddhiman Saha are on their fourth tour of the country.
Ajinkya Rahane and Mohammed Shami are on their third tour, while Rahul and Jasprit Bumrah were part of the closely-contested 2017-18 series which South Africa won 2-1.
“We know what to expect and we’ve had great preparation,” said Rahul. “The pace and bounce is very different to other countries and it was very important that we came here early and had preparation in the middle.”
Rahul indicated India were likely to maintain their recent strategy of picking five bowlers, which he acknowledged would lead to a  “very difficult discussion” about settling on five specialist batsmen.
India have the luxury of choosing between capable players in both batting and bowling, while South Africa’s options seem limited, especially since fast bowler Anrich Nortje withdrew from the series because of a hip injury.
South Africa will, of necessity, field a batting line-up short of proven quality, with two players in their top six yet to score a Test century, while India may be unable to find a place for Shreyas Iyer, who scored 105 and 65 on debut against New Zealand last month.
Elgar confirmed star wicket-keeper/batsman Quinton de Kock was only available for the first Test and will then take paternity leave, which will leave the home team’s batting even more vulnerable.
South Africa’s fast bowling remains their strength but the loss of Nortje is a major blow.
Much will depend on former world number one Kagiso Rabada, whose form in the past two years has been moderate.
The hosts will also hope the injury-plagued Lungi Ngidi can recapture the form which enabled him to take 6-39 on debut against India at the same venue in 2017-18.
In South Africa’s favour, Centurion has been a fortress for the home side, with 21 wins and only two defeats in 26 Tests at the venue.
The second Test will be staged in Johannesburg from Jan 3-7 and the third in Cape Town from Jan 11-15.
Teams:
SOUTH AFRICA (likely): Dean Elgar (captain), Aiden Markram, Keegan Petersen, Rassie van der Dussen, Temba Bavuma, Quinton de Kock (wicket-keeper), Wiaan Mulder, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada, Duanne Olivier, Lungi Ngidi
INDIA (from): Virat Kohli (captain), KL Rahul, Mayank Agarwal, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane, Hanuma Vihari, Shreyas Iyer, Risabh Pant (wkt), Ravichandran Ashwin, Mohammed Shami, Jasprit Bumrah, Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Siraj, Shardul Thakur, Umesh Yadav, Jayant Yadav, Priyank Panchal, Wriddhiman Saha (wicket-keeper)
Umpires: Marais Erasmus, Adrian Holdstock (both South Africa)
TV umpire: Allahuddien Paleker (South Africa)
Match referee: Andy Pycroft (Zimbabwe).

India have enjoyed recent success in Australia and England, but South Africa remains a mighty challenge for the top-ranked Test side, though they will arguably never have had a better chance against a home team going through a transition period and with far less experience than in the past.
“It is a great challenge and a great opportunity for everyone,” Dravid told reporters on Saturday.  “It is something you look forward to as a batsman, the chance to play away from home and test yourself against some really good opposition in their home conditions.
“A lot of your career is defined by those sorts of performances, so it is a great opportunity for everyone in the group to put in the performances that are something that they can remember, and people will remember them for.”
Dravid played 11 Tests in South Africa and averaged under 30, well below his career mark of 52.31, so he is aware of the challenges of adjusting from lower wickets on the sub-continent to the higher bounce of the Highveld.
He said there would be much to consider when selecting a starting XI, and expects those who do not make the cut to be disappointed, something he sees as a positive.
“Most players are professional. Sometimes you have to have difficult conversations. Everyone wants to be part of the playing XI, but they understand situations as long as you can give them the reasons for it [not being selected].
“Players will be disappointed, but that is one of the things that makes people succeed at this level, you want to be playing, competing and part of the action, not sitting out,” Dravid said.

10,Pakistan edge India in thriller to reach U-19 Asia Cup semis,Pakistan have remained unbeaten so far in the event winning both their matches to lead the group ‘A’ table with four points.,"LAHORE: Fast bowler Zeeshan Zemeer’s five-wicket haul backed by a fine 81-run knock by Mohammad Shehzad steered Pakistan to a nail-biting two-wicket victory over arch-rivals India in their group ‘A’ match of the U-19 Asia Cup in Dubai on Saturday.
Chasing 238 for victory, Pakistan achieved their target off the very last ball when Ahmed Khan drove Indian pacer Ravi Kumar for a boundary.
Earlier, right-handed Shehzad played a fighting knock off 105 balls while striking five sixes and four fours.
At 230-7, Pakistan required eight runs for victory in the final over. On the first ball of the over, Pakistan lost Zeeshan, who was the wrecker-in-chief of the Indian innings with five wickets, for a duck to Ravi. But Ahmed (29 not out) with Ali Asfand (1 not out) survived the tense moments and achieved the target on the last ball.
Besides Shehzad and Ahmed, other notable scorers for Pakistan were Maaz Sadaqat (29, four fours), Irfan Khan (32, three fours) and Rizwan Mehmood (29).
For India, pacer Raj Bawa was the main wicket-taker with four for 56.
Earlier after being put into bat, India made a moderate total of 237 all out in 49 overs. Wicket-keeper/batsman Aaradhya Yadav top-scored with an 83-ball 50 containing three fours while opener Harnoor Singh made 46 off 59.
Right-armer Zeeshan was expensive conceding 60 runs in 10 overs but captured five wickets including that of Yadav. Awais Ali claimed 2-43 in his eight overs.
Shehzad for his brilliant match-winning innings was named man-of-the-match.
Pakistan have remained unbeaten so far in the event winning both their matches to lead the group ‘A’ table with four points.
India are second on net-run-rate basis followed by Afghanistan; both have two points each and they are to play each other in the last match, which will decide the second semi-finalist from this group.
In their next match Pakistan face the UAE on Monday.
From group ‘B’, Bangladesh have also qualified for the semi-finals as top team while second-placed Sri Lanka (two points) have bright chances to qualify for the semi-finals. Sri Lanka are to face as to face Nepal and Kuwait in their remaining group matches.

“We are deeply saddened to learn that Ray Illingworth has passed away,” the county wrote on its Twitter account.
He had been undergoing radiotherapy for oesophageal cancer.
Illingworth played 61 Tests for England between 1958 and 1973 and captained the country 31 times, winning 12 matches and an Ashes series in Australia in 1970-1. 
He was an all-rounder who scored 1,836 Test runs at an average of 23.24 and claimed 122 wickets with his off-spin bowling at 31.20.
He was chairman of the England selectors between 1993 and 1996, and coached the team in 1995-96.
Illingworth’s wife, Shirley, died earlier this year after battling cancer and Illing­worth had supported law changes on assisted dying.
Illingworth made his debut for his native county in 1955 and played for them until 1968 before finishing his career at Leicestershire. He captained both counties.

13,"After a one-year absence, Sydney-to-Hobart race set to sail",SYDNEY: Super maxi LawConnect is the favourite for line honours in the Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race beginning on...,"SYDNEY: Super maxi LawConnect is the favourite for line honours in the Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race beginning on Sunday, with the forecast for strong southerly winds on the first night potentially giving it the edge over the other two 100-foot boats.
Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology predicts gusting winds on Sunday afternoon during the start in Sydney Harbour, with the possibility of some thunderstorm activity offshore.
“We love a hard southerly to start with because that’s our best conditions, perhaps gives us an ability to get out a little bit,” LawConnect skipper and owner Christian Beck said.
Last year’s race was cancelled the week before it was due to start because of coronavirus-related quarantine issues, but the 2021 edition is proceeding with mass virus-testing protocols in place for the 900-plus crew on the 91 boats. There were two late withdrawals related to the testing.
The 628 nautical-mile race (1,170 kilometres) sails from Sydney down the south coast of New South Wales state and across Bass Strait to Hobart, the capital of the island state of Tasmania.
In 2017, Comanche set the race record after finishing in 1 day, 9 hours, 15 minutes and 24 seconds, beating Perpetual Loyal’s record of 1 day, 13 hours, 31 minutes and 20 seconds, set the previous year.
Wild Oats XI has won line honours nine times, the last time in 2018, and is the first boat to have claimed the treble race record, line honours and overall winner. Comanche won the race again in 2019.
Another super maxi in this year’s edition, Black Jack, will have to overcome a poor preparation.
The boat didn’t get the chance to race against super maxi rivals LawConnect and SHK Scallywag 100 in the inaugural Australian maxi championship earlier in December after a crew member tested positive for Covid-19. The boat also sustained a broken mast in the Brisbane-Gladstone race in Queensland state in April.
Black Jack, representing the Yacht Club de Monaco in this year’s race, has sailed just five times with her new mast after its delivery from New Zealand was delayed due to coronavirus-related lockdowns in that country.
With no recent racing form she is something of an unknown quantity, though the boat took line honours in 2009 when named Alfa Romeo and finished third, second and fifth from 2017 to 2019, respectively.
One thing working in her favour is the experience of her crew, with 13 having sailed the race at least nine times.
“Our crew on paper is a standout crew in my opinion and that makes a big difference in protecting the asset and getting though heavy conditions,” skipper Mark Bradford said. “There’s a couple of ways to run a sporting team, one is with youth and one is with experience.”
Bradford expects LawConnect to head the fleet early and hopes his boat can make up ground in more favourable light air conditions forecast for later in the race.
