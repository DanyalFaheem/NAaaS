0,FBR mulling strategy to broaden tax base,"Chairman says documentation drive, set to begin in January, is yet to be finalised.","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s top tax machinery has almost finalised a comprehensive strategy for broadening tax base that may be put into motion along with a documentation drive in January, Dawn has learnt from knowledgeable sources.  
The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has collected information about 7.2 million individuals from various sources — banks, utility organisations, and excise and taxation departments — and shared the same with the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) for verification.  
At the same time, Nadra has set aside data of 15m people from its own database. Nadra will process the data to compare it with certain indicators through artificial intelligence to identify non-filers, an official source told Dawn.  
“We are expecting to receive the final list of potential taxpayers by the end of the current month,” the official said, adding the list would only include those people who did not exist on the FBR tax roll.  

Chairman says documentation drive, set to begin in January, is yet to be finalised 

Asked about the number of non-filers or tax evaders likely to be identified through the process, the source said that it was too early to say anything. “It could be a million, maybe less or more. You cannot rule out the presence of taxpayers’ names in the collected data,” the source added.  
The list would be uploaded on the FBR website for information of the general public, the source said, adding the data would also be uploaded on a dedicated interactive App so that people could check their details. On the interactive App, people would also be able to verify or reject the information about them, the source said.  
A dedicated time period will be given to people to file their returns on a voluntary basis. The documentation drive will begin in January with a mass media campaign to urge people to come under the tax net on a voluntary basis. Legal action will be initiated after the lapse of time for voluntarily filing the tax returns.  
Talking to Dawn, FBR Chairman Ashfaq Ahmed said that a new concept was being developed to collect due taxes from all potential taxpayers. Income tax commissioners in the field are working on these lines to bring the untaxed sector into the tax network, he added.  
About the documentation drive, he said nothing has been finalised so far. However, he said that FBR is working with Nadra to bring potential taxpayers into the net.  
On the issue of data, the FBR chairman said data would be available to potential and current taxpayers in a presentable and comprehensible manner through a web portal. Pragmatic steps had been initiated for the compilation of data with the support of Nadra, he added.  
IRS intelligence department 
The FBR chairman said that he had issued instructions to the intelligence and investigation department of the Inland Revenue Service (IRS) to confine their work to investigation and not to recovery of untaxed money.  
In the past, he said the intelligence department’s mode of working was against the income tax law. The law does not permit investigating and recovering money from the tax evaders, he said.  
Mr Ashfaq said that now the directors of the investigation department will send their contravention reports to Director General who after evaluation will submit them to the member operation of IRS.  
After verification at the member level, the report will then be sent to the concerned regional tax office or large taxpayer unit for implementation, the chairman said.  
Mr Ahmed said a considerable increase had been noted in the benami cases. He further said there was no slowdown in the work of FBR, which according to him had “increased manifold”.

1,Stocks manage modest gains in a dull week,KARACHI: The benchmark index of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) remained flat throughout the outgoing week....,"KARACHI: The benchmark index of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) remained flat throughout the outgoing week.
According to data compiled by AKD Securities, the KSE-100 index gained only 218 points or 0.5 per cent on a week-on-week basis to close at 44,118 points.
“This took the cumulative performance throughout 2021 to 0.8pc whereas the dollar-adjusted return currently stands at minus 9pc,” the brokerage house said.
Volumes dried up on a week-on-week basis as the daily average clocked in at 215 million shares versus 265m shares last week, showing an 18.7pc weekly drop.
The stock market performance during the outgoing week was dictated by the news flow relating to the possible resumption of the dormant International Monetary Fund programme, pre-conditions of the programme and the legislation that the country needs to pass in order to unlock the cash flows from the Washington-based lender.
One of the major news stories in the week under review was the current account deficit number for November where the gap stood at $1.9 billion as opposed to the expectation of $2.5bn. Other stories included the approval of textile and auto policies, missing the petroleum levy target by 41pc, $1.5bn loan approval by the Asian Development Bank for power-sector reforms and the increase in the base power tariff by 95 paisa.
Other events affecting the stock market were Unity Wilmar Agro increasing its stake in Unity Foods to 15.1pc, the number of cellular subscribers growing to 106.68m, Ghani Value Glass looking to enter the auto assembling business, auto financing hitting the Rs350bn mark and fertiliser shortages in Sindh and Punjab.
Top performers in the stock market during the outgoing week included Bannu Woollen Mills Ltd, which went up 20.4pc week-on-week, followed by Honda Atlas Cars Ltd (14.8pc), TRG Pakistan Ltd (11pc), Pakistan Stock Exchange Ltd (9.3pc) and Abbott Laboratories Pakistan Ltd (7.2pc).
Laggards on the stock market included Archroma Pakistan Ltd, which went down 15.1pc week-on-week, followed by Sapphire Fibres Ltd (13.1pc), Gatron Industries Ltd (12.9pc), Colgate-Palmolive Pakistan Ltd (11pc) and JDW Sugar Mills Ltd (7.4pc).
The top-performing sector was power generation that posted a rise of 4pc week-on-week on the news of the payment of outstanding dues. It was followed by pharmaceutical (3.7pc) and textile spinning (3pc) sectors.
Foreigners remained net buyers with an inflow of $3.7m, cushioning the sell-off by mutual funds ($3.6m) and individuals ($2.6m).

2,Ministry delays pact signing with power firms,Meeting slated for Dec 22 was abruptly put off at the eleventh hour; NTDC fears backlash.,"LAHORE: Following grave concerns expressed by the Boards of Directors (BoDs) and fearing resistance during a scheduled meeting, the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) has delayed signing of agreements among the Power Planning and Monitoring Company (PPMC), all power distribution and generation companies (Discos and Gencos) and the National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC).  
The Power Division also started reviewing the agreements under which the affairs of Discos and NTDC are to be controlled by the PPMC, formerly known as the Pakistan Electric Power Company (Pepco), Dawn learnt on Saturday. 

Meeting slated for Dec 22 was abruptly put off at the eleventh hour; NTDC fears backlash

“The Power Division had invited CEOs/MDs of all Discos and NTDC to a meeting scheduled on Dec 22. During the meeting, the CEOs/MDs were supposed to sign agreements for a period of 10 years on behalf of their organisations and BoDs with the PPMC. However, suddenly on Dec 21 evening, the ministry postponed the meeting after it received a negative feedback from some of the BoDs on various clauses of the agreements that fully empower the PPMC to rule Discos, Gencos and NTDC,” an official source told Dawn. 
“There are also reports that the CEOs/MDs of various companies have been advised by their respective BoDs to not attend the meeting. [The head were told that] if any pressure is mounted by the ministry to attend the meeting, they must avoid signing the agreements,” the official requesting anonymity claimed. 
According another official source, the autonomous bodies/organisations such as companies, authorities, etc, under the Corporate Governance Rules, are supposed to be governed independently since they have their own BoDs having representation of public and private departments concerned. 
“Therefore, the formation of PPMC after dissolving Pepco to monitor and intervene into the affairs of Discos, Gencos and NTDC is absolutely wrong and unjustified,” he added. 
The ministry, on the other hand, says the dynamics of the power sector require dedicated institutional capacity for providing support to the government in development of policies, strategic plans, frameworks, cross-sectoral and cross value chain integration and performance monitoring and reporting on strategic initiatives. 
Under its various functions, the PPMC would continue to charge a fee to Discos, Gencos and NTDC as determined by its BoD from time to time. 
“In pursuance of these decisions, all boards of Discos, Gencos and NTDC are required to comply with the planning and monitoring agreement with PPMC along with authorising the respective CEO/MD to the sign the same. The signing of agreements between PPMC and All Discos, Gencos and NTDC would be held on December 22 at 11am in the committee room of Power Division, Islamabad,” read a recent letter from the Power Division sent to the Discos, Gencos and NTDC.

3,Pakistan Stock Exchange to promote retail trade in debt securities market: CEO,"Says lack of liquidity has prevented retail investors from taking exposure to 
the market","KARACHI: The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) is determined to promote retail trade in the debt securities market through its platform in 2022, PSX CEO Farrukh H. Khan said. 
Speaking to Dawn in a recent interview, the head of the country’s only bourse said the PSX has brought on board 12 banks as market-makers to ensure retail investors have easy access to the debt securities market. 
Equity investors can theoretically buy and sell debt securities, ranging from private companies’ bonds and sukuk to government-issued treasury bills, on the PSX platform. However, the daily volume of debt securities traded on the PSX is negligible for a variety of reasons. 
“We put in place all the building blocks in 2021. We’re integrating our system with those of the market-
makers. Next year, we’ll generate activity in both primary and secondary markets for debt securities,” said Mr Khan. 

Farrukh says lack of liquidity has prevented retail investors from taking exposure to 
  the market 

Inadequate understanding of debt securities among the client-facing employees of brokerage houses is one of the main reasons for low trade volumes, he said. But more importantly, lack of liquidity owing to the absence of counterparty has prevented retail investors from taking exposure to the debt market, he said. 
“Market-makers will soon be putting up bid and offer rates for all sorts of debt securities, ensuring that the counterparty is always available if a retail investor wants to trade,” he said. 
In addition, Mr Khan said 2022 will witness the launch of at least one fixed-income exchange-traded fund (ETF) – an asset class consisting of a basket of different securities that retail investors can buy and sell just like a single stock. It’ll allow stock investors to divert their investments to fixed-income securities like bonds and sukuk as soon as they decide to reduce their exposure to the equity market for whatever reason, he added. 
Foreign selling
According to the data compiled by Arif Habib Ltd, foreign ownership of shares as a percentage of free-float market capitalisation is hovering at a 10-year low of around $2 billion, thanks to the incessant selling by overseas investors. 
“Instead of growing, our stock market size has gone down in dollar terms from $100bn to $50bn in recent years,” he said, noting that devaluation has played a major role in it. In addition to stock valuations, foreign investors also look at liquidity and the market size before making decisions, he added. 
“We often forget that the PSX has mostly old-economy stocks. These stocks trade at lower [price-to-earnings] multiples than new-economy stocks everywhere in the world... our valuations are definitely low but they aren’t as low as many people like to believe,” he said. 
Low volumes
The PSX launched the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) board in 2021, which is a separate counter reserved for new and growing companies carrying higher investment and liquidity risks than mature companies listed on the exchange’s main board. 
However, the two GEM-listed companies have received low volumes since their public offerings towards the end of 2021. Brokers have attributed the subdued activity in these shares to the regulator’s requirement that only institutions or accredited individual investors with net assets of at least Rs5m can trade on the GEM counter. 
“Volumes will grow once there’re at least five to 10 companies on the GEM counter,” said Mr Khan, adding that the condition of net assets of at least Rs5 million is both “low” and “reasonable”. 
Brokers have demanded that there should be “no disparity” between ready and GEM counters as the screening and documentation procedures for accredited investors increase the brokers’ cost of doing business. 
“Developing the understanding of a new product always takes time. Brokers should make an effort to better understand it,” he said, adding that brokers are required to just check one box online after their
clients self-certify as qualified investors. 
As for the botched rollout of a new trading system in October, Mr Khan said it had issues in its front end that were “completely unexpected” because they never showed up in mocks. 
Bought from China’s Shenzhen Stock Exchange at the price of RsRs461.2m, its implementation led to thin volumes in subsequent trading sessions. Users complained about the absence of basic features and frequent glitches causing trade execution delays. Following protests from a majority of brokers, the PSX restored the old system until the bugs in the new one were fixed. 
“We’re committed to the new system. We’ll reintroduce it in two to three months,” he said.

4,China’s offshore listing rules may ease market uncertainty,Says the ecurities regulator’s new filing-based system  leaves open questions about rule enforcement and compliance criteria.,"HONG KONG: China’s plan to tighten scrutiny over mainland companies’  overseas share sales is likely to ease the regulatory uncertainty that roiled financial markets this year and stalled offshore listings,  bankers and analysts said.
But the securities regulator’s new  filing-based system, designed to rein in once freewheeling Chinese  listings in the US market and elsewhere, leaves open questions about  rule enforcement and compliance criteria, they added.
“The new  rules represent a comprehensive, systemic and market-oriented regulatory  upgrade,” investment bank China International Capital Corp (CICC) said  in a note but added they contain  “some items that need further  observation and clarification”.
The China Securities and  Regulatory Commission published draft rules  late on Friday requiring filings by companies seeking offshore listings  under a framework to ensure they comply with Chinese laws and  regulations.
Companies using a so-called variable interest entity  (VIE) structure will still be allowed to seek offshore listings as long  as they are compliant, removing uncertainty for investors who feared  China would block such listings.

5,Govt asked to check influx of cheap Iranian cooking oil,Iranian cooking oil and canola oil is being offered at Rs240-325 per litre while locally produced oil is sold for Rs380-400.,"KARACHI: Producers have warned that  the flooding of cheap smuggled Iranian cooking oil is not only  affecting the market share of the local edible oil industry but also  causing revenue losses to the exchequer. 
A number of market  players or middlemen, using social media platforms, have been  offering Iranian cooking oil and canola oil at Rs240-325 per litre  saying “the prices are negotiable” while the locally produced cooking  oil is being sold between Rs380-400 per litre.
They have also shown  their desire to sell the Iranian products in bulk  to only small local  producers of cooking oil. The demand for cheap  Iranian oil has been  growing in the last one month in Karachi and  upcountry markets due to a  high tax of Rs80 per kg or Rs80,000 per  tonne on the import of edible  oil in Pakistan.
The Pakistan Vanaspati Manufacturers Association  (PVMA) through its Dec 17 letter had informed Finance Adviser Shaukat Tarin  and Director General of the Pakistan Standard Quality Control Authority (PSQCA)  Ali Bux Soomro that due to the high tax structure on import of edible oil,  the cross-border smuggling through porous borders has been thriving.
PVMA  Chairman Tariq Ullah Sufi and Senior Vice Chairman Sheikh Amjad Rasheed  said that the dumping of Iranian oil is causing revenue loss to the  national kitty but also hitting the sales of ""Made in Pakistan” products in  the domestic market. They said the smuggled goods are non-certified and  substandard edible oil products, hence a threat to human health,  therefore these products must be checked and stopped for keeping in  stock and selling under the stipulations of PSQCA Act 1996 and rules  framed there-under.
They called upon the provincial food authorities  of Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan and Khyber Pakthtunkhwa to take notice of  this issue of public interest.
The attractive profit margins,  available to the implied undocumented and grey supply chain of smuggled  goods, suggest that the illegal practice is liable to further flourish  if left unattended, the PVMA said.
It is a universally accepted  and experienced phenomenon that raw materials and finished goods on  which incidence of duty/taxes and other levies are higher in comparison  with the regional and neighboring countries are prone to smuggling and  thus the local industry is witnessing the same scenario, the association  added.
Unfortunately, the law enforcement agencies, tax offices,  district administration and management authorities, besides other  registering and licensing regulators are not paying any heed to the  issue, hence the legitimate, documented and tax obedient industry is  seriously suffering and sustaining irreparable financial losses by  losing market share.
Mr Rasheed said the association has sought time  from Finance Adviser Shaukat Tarin and the chairman FBR for taking any  action against the influx of Iranian oil in order to save the local  industry.
A ghee/cooking oil producer said since the Iranian product  is not according to PSQSA standard then it could be injurious to human  health.
He said the government should save the local industry which  is already struggling due to rupee depreciation against the dollar, the  current gas crisis, and high tariff on edible oil imports.
PVMA  Secretary-General Umer Islam Khan said the low price of Iranian oil  means that there is no tax or duty on the product while the Iranian  government also provides subsidies.
On the government’s plan to  reduce the general sales tax to 8.5pc from 17pc at import stage of palm  oil and oil seeds and 50pc cut in customs duty on import of palm oil, he  said “so far nothing has been done.”
He said Pakistan consumes  4.5 million tonnes of ghee and cooking oil annually. Import of palm oil  (main raw material of making edible oil products) stands at three to  3.1m tonnes per annum. Besides, 3.2m tonnes of seeds are imported to  extract 900,000 tonnes of canola and soyabean oil. The industry gets  400,000 tonnes of oil from cottonseed, rapeseed, canola seed, and corn.
