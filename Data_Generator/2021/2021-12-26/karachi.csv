0,Ismail challenges PPP to bring in better bus service than Green Line,First Bus Rapid Transit Service starts commercial operation in Karachi.,"• First BRTS starts commercial operation in Karachi
• To be at full capacity of total 80 buses from Jan 10     
KARACHI: Describing it as a ‘healthy’ competition between the federal and the Sindh governments to build Bus Rapid Transit Service (BRTS) for Karachi to provide modern transport system to more than 20 million citizens of the city, Sindh Governor Imran Ismail on Saturday challenged the provincial government of the PPP to bring in a better bus service than the federal government-funded Green Line which, he claimed, was up to international standard.
Taking a ride on the first day of its commercial operation, the Sindh governor travelled from Numaish to Hyderi in North Nazimabad and called the service a ‘gift’ to Karachiites on the birthday of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah.
However, he said the service would start operating at its full capacity of all 80 buses from Jan 10, 2020 after fixing up a few minor glitches.
“It’s a big day for Karachiites,” he said while responding to a question from reporters onboard.
“After more than 15 years, I think the Karachi people have this kind of public transport service. This trend would continue I hope and more bus services would come in for the people of this city.”
Orange Line 
The governor said that the Sindh government-funded Orange Line was also in final phases.
“I hope it will soon be connected with this [Green Line]. And I call it healthy competition between the two [federal and provincial] governments. The federal government has built this one and I challenge the Sindh [government] to bring a better one. Then the centre would think over brining much better. This competition would ultimately benefit the people of Karachi,” he said.
He said that within the next few years he was seeing Karachi having a modern transport system competing with major urban centres of the world. The original plan titled ‘Karachi Breeze’ was the only way to resolve the transport problem of the city once and for all, he added.
Some 112.9 kilometres long BRT projects are in place under Karachi Breeze project through five dedicated lines.
However, so far only one out of five lines named Green Line has started its service.
As the wait for Karachiites for the Green Line is over with its completion after more than five years since its groundbreaking in 2016, the Sindh government’s Orange Line is seen second in line to offer its services.
However, there is no visible movement in the three other lines — Red, Blue and Yellow — and their fate is not known yet.
Subscription card for commuters 
The Sindh governor said the federal government had introduced a technology-based fare system for Green Line passengers where the people would have to get subscription card.
The card system was the first of its kind to maintain transparency, cost effectiveness and hassle free service to people, he said.
While explaining the fare system, an official at the Sindh Infrastructure Development Company Ltd (SIDCL) said that minimum subscription of the fare card was set at Rs100 and after first deduction of Rs15 after first two kilometres it would cost passengers Rs5 per two kilometres.

1,Two die in late-night pickup rollover at Do Darya,Witnesses say the vehicle spun out of the driver's control and skidded off the road.,"KARACHI: Two persons were killed and their third companion had sustained serious injuries when their fast-moving pickup truck skidded off the road and fell into the rocky and marshy land between the seashore and Seaview Road at Do Darya early on Saturday morning, police and rescue officials said. 
They added that three men in a double cabin vehicle, bearing registration number KY-6082, were travelling on the road along Do Darya in the middle of the night. 
Witnesses said that the speedy vehicle went out of the driver’s control at a point and despite applying brakes it skidded off the road and plunged into the rocky and swampy land off the road along the beach. 
“The vehicle flipped and rolled over several times before stopping,” said an official at the Clifton police station. “The bodies and the injured were taken out of the mangled vehicle after hectic efforts as the occupants were stuck in the wreckage.”
The police said the deceased were identified as 40-year-old Mir Fahad and 24-year-old Khadim Hussain while the 20-year-old injured was identified as Zeeshan. 
“They are relatives and residents of Gulshan-i-Hadeed. The injured underwent surgery and was unconscious. Once he recovers and shares something with police about the accident, we can say what really happened,” said the official. “However, it seems over-speeding was the cause of the accident.” 
Girl found dead in suspicious circumstances A 13-year-old girl was found dead at her Orangi Town home on Saturday. 
The police initially saw the death of Anusha as suicide, but they later decided to launch an investigation before registering a case. 
They are waiting for the final autopsy report of the girl. Two younger brothers found the body of their sister hanging from a ceiling fan in the home. Some questions remained unanswered during the investigations, the police added.

5,CS told to decide bailout package for KMC in 15 days,KARACHI: Expressing displeasure over the provincial authorities for an inordinate delay in providing a bailout...,"KARACHI: Expressing displeasure over the provincial authorities for an inordinate delay in providing a bailout package to the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), the Sindh High Court has directed the chief secretary and principal secretary to the chief minister to ensure that a decision must be taken within 15 days.
A two-judge bench comprising Justice Irfan Saadat Khan and Justice Agha Faisal observed that despite the lapse of more than a year, the package had not been given to the KMC to meet its expenses.
The bench said that in November last year, the SHC was informed that a bailout package was suggested for the KMC after its officials said that they were facing acute shortage of funds to clear post-retirement benefits of its retired employees.
At the outset of the hearing, the local government department said that the matter had been sent to a sub-committee to take action on it as per rules in September this year.
The bench was further informed that the provincial government in its meeting held on Dec 9, under the chairmanship of the chief minister, had discussed and deliberated upon the proposal of the sub-committee, but no decision had been taken yet.
“We, thereafter, under the circumstances, direct the Chief Secretary and Principle Secretary to Chief Minister Sindh to put up the matter before the Chief Minister, Sindh, so that the matter, which is pending since quite sometime, could be decided without any further delay. We expect that the decision in this instant matter would be taken within fifteen days from the date of receipt of this order,” the bench said in its order.
While hearing a set of petitions filed by the retired employees of the KMC against non-payment of their post-retirement benefits, last year the SHC had also directed the city administrator to identify 25 properties of the KMC to sell since a proposed special grant of the provincial government would not be sufficient to settle the dues of its pensioners.
It had observed that the post-retirement benefits of KMC’s retired employees was Rs4.246 billion and could not be settled by the proposed monthly grant-in-aid or the provincial government may give a one-time special grant.

The event began with a documentary film titled Ximei directed by Andy Cohen. It focuses on a Chinese AIDS activist, a peasant woman named Liu Ximei. She has a heart of gold and is out there to help and fight for her fellow AIDS patients who contracted the disease from blood transfusion in the 1990s. (In the ‘90s a big number of farmers were ‘encouraged’ by the authorities to sell blood; unfortunately, it is said and as was mentioned in the description provided by the festival’s organisers, many of them became HIV-infected from unhygienic medical equipment.) 
In the pursuit of her goal and becoming the voice of the victims of the debilitating ailment, she begins to face multiple challenges. With the support of a group who gets along with her, Ximei manages to lend a helping hand to those who are discriminated against. The 2019 American venture has won a few awards, including the Golden Butterfly Award at the Movies That Matter Festival.
The other items of the festival included a documentary on a Hazara boxer by Safar Ali Danish and the Karachi premiere of Gulzar, a 30-minute film by the renowned TV playwright Fasih Bari Khan. Described as a story exploring the layers of self-discovery, it homes in on the people living in the red-light area.
The venue also held a simultaneous art exhibition titled Ay Jazba-i-Dil curated by Rumaisa in which works of artists Aqsa Waheed, Fahad Ubaid, Zaheer Mirza and Sumayyah Aidrus were displayed.   
Earlier, the host of the programme informed the audience that the festival aims to highlight issues faced by sexual and religious minorities.

9,"Notices issued to federal, Sindh officials on plea against ‘sale of unapproved seeds’",HYDERABAD: A division bench of the Sindh High Court (SHC) has issued notices to the federal secretary of the ...,"HYDERABAD: A division bench of the Sindh High Court (SHC) has issued notices to the federal secretary of the National Food Security & Research (NFS&R), director general of the Federal Seed Certification & Registration (FSC&R), Sindh agriculture secretary agriculture, director general of the agriculture extension and four divisional directors of the agriculture department for Jan 27 on a constitutional petition.
The petition was filed by Syed Mir Mohammad Shah, a grower, through Advocate Ayatullah Khowaja praying the court to direct the respondent officers to check sale of unapproved seed varieties in Sindh. 
He submitted in court that the respondents were supposed to ensure enforcement of the Seed Act 1976, that governed the mechanism for the sale, use and stocking of approved seed. The Act was amended in 2015 and the clause K of the act’s Section-6 inserted which says that the agro-economic value of different varieties of seed regarding regional suitability for registration is to be determined.
The petitioner stated that inclusion of this clause was very specific. He said different companies were selling their seeds without suitability and adaptability of such seeds in other provinces considering the fact that climate of one province varied from other province. He said that such practice was causing losses to growers and also affecting productivity.
He said that the respondents under the amended Act were required to visit dealers and shopkeepers connected with the business of seeds in order to see that they were selling only approved seeds. He claimed that despite directives, the respondents failed to check sale of unapproved seeds to growers. He said that the respondents were not abiding by the Act.
He also claimed that different companies of other provinces were selling seeds in Sindh without approval under this Act. He said that seeds of those companies were not suitable to the climate of Sindh and dealers were purchasing and selling unapproved varieties without any check by the FSC&R. He said that these seeds did not give required productivity.
The petitioner stated that if any company intended to sell its seeds in Sindh, it was legally bound to get the seeds inspected through the provincial FSC&R department. He said that a list of approved seeds had already been published by the Sindh Seed Council. For the last one decade, sale of unapproved seeds continued in Sindh.
He said that now when the Rabi season had begun, sale of unapproved wheat crop seed continued in different divisions of Sindh although the matter was brought to the notice of respondent officers. He said that Kharif season would begin in March next year and unapproved cotton crop seed would be sold. He said that cotton was an important crop and generated revenue for growers.
The petitioner said that due to violation of the Act, growers were sustaining heavy losses and it was also affecting the national economy and food requirement of the country. 
He prayed the court to direct the respondents to ensure that no unapproved seed varieties were transported, sold and stocked in Sindh. He urged the court to direct the respondents to visit markets in order to check stocking and sale of unapproved varieties of seeds.

11,Wapda CBA warns of sit-ins if Discos privatised,LARKANA: The All Pakistan Wapda Hydro Electric Workers Union (CBA) has opposed the federal government’s decision ...,"LARKANA: The All Pakistan Wapda Hydro Electric Workers Union (CBA) has opposed the federal government’s decision to privatise power distribution companies (Discos) on the directives of the IMF and warned if the move is not dropped thousands of workers will stage a sit-in. 
Abdul Latif Nizamani, central president of the CBA, said at a union workers’ gathering and a press conference at Nizamani labour hall on Saturday that contrary to national interests the government was deliberately weakening the power distribution companies to make them fit for privatisation.  
The objective of private entrepreneurs was only to capture resources and maximize profit, he said, citing example of Karachi’s K-Eelc­tric, which was producing electricity with expensive oil.  
He said that circular debts had increased and ruined national economy. The government was opting for privatisation at the behest of the IMF and the World Bank as these institutions lent money only condition that their interests were protected, he said.  
He demanded the government shelve the decision on privatisation and provide job protection and protective gear to the employees. Only mentally satisfied workers could protect the company and the Wapda union had proposed protection of employees, reduction in electricity prices and securing consumer connections, he said. 
Nizamani flanked by Iqbal Khan, secretary general, and Nisar Shaikh, regional chairman of the union, said that an outfit called One Five, which enjoyed officials’ support and worked within the organisation, was involved in power theft and extortion. Such mafias needed to be curbed, he said.  
He said that the higher the electricity tariff, the more electricity would be stolen. More than 13 power companies had their board of directors that held meetings almost every day and their expenses came to around Rs45,000 per day, he had. 
He said that there were 150,000 technical workers who demanded that privatisation be postponed, otherwise, they would hold sit-ins and the government would be responsible for the consequences.  
Nizamani alleged that the government was not providing gas to power generation units to enable them to produce cheaper electricity and termed the privatisation policy as ‘Looto and phooto’ (rob and flee). 
SUKKUR: Nizamani told media persons after addressing a workers’ gathering here on Bandar Road that the CBA had rejected the plans for forced privatisation of Wapda. 
He demanded that steps should be taken for the upgradation of Wapda and hydroelectric institute and more than 65,000 vacant posts should be filled to improve performance of the institute. He said that they would offer stiff resistance to privatisation of the Wapda because it would definitely increase rate of per unit of electricity and consumers would suffer ultimately.
