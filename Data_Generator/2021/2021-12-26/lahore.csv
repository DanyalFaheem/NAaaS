0,"Local bodies posts’ term is not extendable, rules LHC",Justice Jawad Hassan gives detailed verdict on petitions by the LG representatives.,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has ruled that the term of the local bodies’ posts under the Punjab Local Government Act of 2013 is fixed and not extendable.
“It is obvious that the word term mentioned in section 30(1) of the Act of 2013 is fixed and definite in its nature,” Justice Jawad Hassan maintains in his detailed verdict on petitions by the LG representatives. The judge had dismissed the petitions on Dec 17.
Lord Mayor retired Col Mubashir Javed and others had requested the court to include in their term the period that was consumed during dissolution of the Act of 2013 till restoration of the local bodies by the Supreme Court on March 25, 2021 that comes to almost 22 months.
The judge observes that a combined reading of section 30(1) and section 126 of the Act of 2013 makes it quite clear that if any local government is elected for a period of five years, the said period would be governed by section 30(1) of the Act of 2013 and it would start on the date of first meeting of the elected government. And this provision is subject to other provisions of the Act of 2013, which empowers the provincial government to dissolve the local government under section 126 of the same law.
The judge notes that the first meeting of the elected local governments under the Act of 2013 was held on Jan 2, 2017 and the term of holding office for five years started from that date which would expire after completing five years. However, the local government constituted under the 2013 law was dissolved on May 4, 2019 due to promulgation of the new Act through section 3 and the same was restored by the SC and a notification issued on Oct 17, 2021 by the LG department and they started performing their functions.
The judge remarks that in political theory “term of office” and “tenure of office” are terms oftentimes contrasted with each other. Term of office refers to the period, either fixed by the Constitution or a statute, within which a public official may hold office.
He says tenure of office, on the other hand, is the period within which a public official actually held office within a prescribed term. In other words, term of office is fixed, while tenure of office is variable.
Justice Hassan observes that the word ‘term’ mentioned in section 30(1) of the 2013 Act is fixed and definite in its nature. He notes that the time for holding an office for a period of five years is not extendable by any means, which would commence on a date of the first meeting of the members/representative of local government, which in case of the petitioners was held on Jan 1, 2017 and the same would expire on Dec 31, 2021.

2,Hamza says solution to problems lies in fair polls,Says country can't move forward till there is civilian supremacy.,"LAHORE: Opposition Leader in Punjab Assembly Hamza Shehbaz has said that the only solution to Pakistan’s problems lies in fresh, free and fair elections.
Speaking at a ceremony here on Saturday, the PML-N leader said as long as there was no civilian supremacy the country couldn’t move forward.
“Imran Khan is a fake prime minister as he has come to power through rigged polls. He is a liar. He is a player and played with the nation,” he alleged and added that the result of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa local government election was a trailer and when free and fair general polls were held the people would throw him out of Banigala.
Hamza asked Imran Khan to stop playing “mafia, mafia” as nothing was a bigger mafia than the premier and his team. “I don’t hate Imran Khan. I am bitter about him because he has deceived the people, making their lives miserable,” he added.
He said the PML-N would make Imran Khan accountable for his deeds. He also questioned why Kalabagh Dam had not been built, who was responsible for this. “In coming days there will be shortage of water in Pakistan,” he said and added Imran Khan was only good at putting plaques on the projects of PML-N Quaid Nawaz Sharif.

6,Residents of two villages evacuated after Indus erosion,More than a hundred people have been evacuated from the villages of Jatoi and Lundi Pittafi.,"

MUZAFFARGARH: More than one hundred people from the villages of Jatoi and Lundi Pittafi have been evacuated after their houses and farmland were swept away by the erosion in the river Indus.
Along with the houses, more than 1,000 acre land, which had sugarcane crop cultivated on it, also disappeared.
Khadim Chandia, one of the affected, said he was waiting for the return of his hard work in the form of the sugarcane crop but his dream had been shattered as his whole crop as well as land had been eroded. He said he was looking towards the government for help.
Some other people said the Indus eroded their all green land and they were running from the government departments to the local MPs for help. They shared their concerns about the lack of arrangements, absence of spur along the river or safety measures by the authorities. They said the irrigation officials had advised them to launch a protest to force the government release funds for the spurs. They complained about the cold attitude and lack of interest on the part of the irrigation higher-ups.
The affected farmers, including Muhammad Ismael, said their delegations called on the local MPA, seeking arrangements to control erosion who told them that he had met with the chief minister many times for seeking funds and that the release of funds was under process. They said they had met Chief Engineer (Irrigation) of Dera Ghazi Khan Sajid Rizvi who told them the river erosion was natural and the irrigation department could not do much about it.
When Dawn contacted Irrigation Exen Usman, he said the department had no funds to control erosion.
Chief Engineer Sajid Rizvi said he had constituted a team to visit the erosion site.
The residents of affected villages appealed to Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar and Prime Minister Imran Khan to take notice of their plight and compensate for their loss.

8,Harking Back: How the very first Muslims trickled into Lahore,Just how do we determine who the very first Muslim inhabitants and invaders of Lahore were? Most believe that come...,"Just how do we determine who the very first Muslim inhabitants and invaders of Lahore were? Most believe that come Mahmud, the Turko-Afghan invader from Ghazni, in 1021, that the first Muslims had arrived. This just belies serious research.
Before Islam spread to Lahore, our land experienced three major ‘invasions’ from the West as forces headed to the East from the mountain passes of the north-western passes, they being the Sakas, the Kushans and the White Huns. They are classified as being between the ancient and the medieval periods of Indian sub-continental history. What we do know about the Mauryas, the Sakas and the Kushans has been mostly derived from inscriptions and coins, which in their own right are of reasonable historic reliability, yet the White Huns, or the ‘third invasion’ brought forth the Rajput tradition, which is very much alive today.
The Huns hordes settled in the Khyber region and beyond in Punjab and further to Rajputana. The Huns were broadly divided into two sects, they being the Hun Jats who were primarily agricultural, and the Gujjars who were pastoral. Both are very closely related. A recent study of both these Huns sects thanks to DNA research shows them as very closely similar, with minor differences.
Moving northwards from Gandhara we have the Gujjars settling in Swat, Dir, Mardan and downwards towards Gujrat. It makes sense for these are the greenest north-western portions of the sub-continent and excellent for pastoral pastimes. On the other hand, the Huns Jats moved eastwards to settle in the plains watered by the rivers of Punjab. In that sense we see that Lahore and its surroundings were strictly Jat territory, and the ancient city of Lahore always had a Jat population with a Rajput ruler.
But the White Huns mingled with the local Dravidians, who over the centuries pushed eastwards. Mind you the very first humans to populate our sub-continent migrated from Africa, eons before the White Huns came, and moved along the coast and up the rivers. The oldest planned city in the sub-continent, probably also of the world, is Mehrgarh in Balochistan, where the population still to this day speak Brahui, a language with a Dravidian structure, and amazingly in isolation to the Indo-European languages surrounding them. Our ancient Punjabi language, as is the recently invented Urdu, as also Persian and Turkish, are all Indo-European in structure.
The best description of the Rajput Pathans and Punjabis has been provided by Olaf Caroe who writes: “… they are reckless and daring, loyal to the chiefs they trust, love sports, take offence quickly and when they have no enemies they quarrel among themselves”. Our rural population are even today known, once the annual crop money comes in, to pass their time in litigation after a deliberate fight.
Now before we dwell on the first Muslims to reach Lahore let us take a very brief look at the Arab conquest of Mesopotamia in 642 AD. After Hamadan was conquered, the flow of Arab and Turk Muslims were to influence Iranians life in a massive way. The flight of the Zoroastrians, mostly from Pars, hence Parsis, to avoid the onslaught of Muslim forces saw them settle all over the Indian sub-continent. The Iranians were profoundly influenced by this change, and it were they who moved eastwards.
Between the integration of the White Huns with the Dravidian population of our lands, we have a 400-year gap in which the White Huns disappeared as an entity, though their traits remains very much with us and within our genes. In those days Lahore was ruled by a Rajput Prithviraj Chauhan. This begs the question that just why did an Ajmer person come to rule Lahore. The reason is simple geography. Lahore was located on the highway linking India to the mountains in the West, and was an ancient trade route.
The constant invasions from Afghanistan needed a location to prepare for trade and military retaliation. Lahore was the ideal location. That is why the ancient epic of Mahabharata describes a war between the Kaurava and the Pandava princes on the banks of the River Ravi at Mahmood Booti in Lahore. It was a fight of the ruler of Lahore, Prince Bharata, for possession of the river trade port and the trade route to the east.
The Afghans and their tribal cousins living to the east of the Khyber Mountains, were constantly trying to possess the prized port and trade route of Lahore. In the year 682 AD, a major conversion to Islam took place among the Afghans, who till then were primarily Buddhists. But then, it seems, their growing population needed some economic means of sustenance. The wealth of Iran and more so of the sub-continent has always attracted the people of this landlocked country. Since those times religion has been used as an excuse to invade Punjab, more so Lahore.
The constant invasions by the Afghans forced the Rajput Chauhan ruler to move initially towards Sialkot, and then deeper into today’s India and Ajmer. We learn of Lahore remaining empty for almost two centuries, with local Rajput Jats with Gujjars uniting to repel foreign invaders.
According to Ferishta in 682 AD the newly-converted inhabitants started a series of wars to take over the lands and territories of Hindu rulers. Initially the newly-converted Pathans were repelled, but then they formed a critical alliance with the Ghakkars of the Salt Range, who were initially allies of Raja Prithviraj Chauhan, then changed sides and forced him to cede large tracts of land to the east. The move towards Lahore had started. The ancient epics talk of 70 major battles taking place before Mahabharata took place, in which the ruler of Lahore and his army roundly defeated an alliance of nine rulers, including from, and of, Waziristan, Kabul and Multan.
These battles were followed by others in which the Bussas of Lahore moved to defend Chittore against the Muslim invaders in 872 AD. After this battle scores of Afghan traders started trade ties with the stockists of Lahore. The first Muslims to come to Lahore came in the shape of traders, just as before them the Zoroastrians under Bhandara came and ruled Lahore.
We see a series of human movements of Afghans towards Lahore taking place, each one followed by invasions and then Afghan rule. Today we have almost 62 per cent of the inhabitants of the old walled city being Afghans. What will this mean for our future? Once the Taliban are established and recognised by the powerful western nations, will they threaten our land and city again? Will they start by not recognising our borders? To imagine that this is not on the mind of every thinking Pakistani is to live in a fool’s paradise.

9,Much-needed solar energy yet to pick up steam,"Global concerns over climate change, greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy have yet to find space in...","

White Star

 
Global concerns over climate change, greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy have yet to find space in conversations here despite the government’s efforts to shed some light on the issue. While some middle-class and upward households have adopted renewable solar energy over the last decade, their reasons for the move vary and the numbers are too low to create an impact. Whether this shift is led by concerns about environmental degradation is yet to be known, but a host of other issues has driven their approach, including rising electricity costs.
Consumers and industry stakeholders say a lot more needs to be done for this trend to catch up on a mass scale – raising awareness about the need for switching from grid-provided energy, reducing cost of the facility and government facilitation to providing easy access to the technology.
Nonetheless, households are increasingly switching to clean sustainable energy and some housing schemes, too, are encouraging their residents to go solar. Model Town is one such locality where the society that runs its affairs has sent out letters to push locals to avail themselves of the renewable power option. While officials deny reaching out to residents, a few locals claimed to have received notices.
“We can’t ask anyone to do anything; people install solar panels themselves and then apply with us after which we conduct an inquiry whether they’re the rightful owners of a house or are defaulting. We have not sent out letters or put up banners asking residents to do so,” Mr Dawood Barry, the Model Town Society president, told Dawn.
However, a resident, who wished not to be named, said the society had been sending out letters to residents encouraging the implementation of solar power units. He believes they’re doing this because right now the society is buying electricity in bulk from Wapda, which costs them considerably.
“Once solar panels are installed in most of the households, the need for electricity will reduce, decreasing the society’s overall costs, eventually working in their favour,” he remarked.
When asked if he’s planning to switch to solar power, he said he would despite the fact that even the cheapest system is expensive. “It’s a huge investment, but an ‘investment’ nonetheless as the implementation costs will be covered in a couple of years and with the rising prices of electricity in the country, it will eventually make a considerable difference in the overall utilities expense for the household,” the elderly resident said.
A report by Islamabad’s Rural Development Policy Institute (RDPI) also acknowledges that technologies such as solar and wind are capital intensive. Financing plays a key role to its wide-scale deployment, wherein easy access and user-friendly direct financing for solar panels from financial institutions are seen as crucial to increased responsiveness from potential borrowers, it states.
Though people had started switching to solar energy in the mid-2000s amid extended power cuts, the reach was extremely slow owing to the high prices. In the mid-2010s, more and more industrial, commercial and domestic consumers moved to solar power as the government pushed for on- and off-grid renewable energy.
This little push came after the government introduced net-metering and made the regulatory process for approval of its licences easier and quicker. Net-metering allows solar capacity purchasers to sell surplus power they generate back to the national grid, saving on operational costs.
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) had introduced a financing scheme for solar and wind technology, called SBP Financing Scheme for Renewable Energy, providing loans at very low interest rate and easy terms. However, the RDPI stated, solar financing still remains in its infancy and is characterised by several demand-side and supply-side barriers.
A consumer says despite all measures the technology remains out of reach of a majority of people. Prices for solar equipment for households could drop if and when government policies encourage local manufacturing of panels or the technology’s prices drop globally from where most of it is imported, he suggests.
Dr Qasim Gara, a resident of Gulberg who has been using solar power at home for years, strongly advocates the technology for the long-term benefits it offers despite the high initial cost, which he says is eventually recovered in a couple of years through much lower electricity bills. “It’s not difficult at all to get started as the entire equipment is readily available here. A house of three rooms can power its lights and fans with a basic solar system costing around Rs50,000. This will generate zero electricity bill and is easy to install also.”
For relying completely on solar power, one would have to go for a bigger system; the bigger the equipment, the higher will be its cost. That will lead to a respite from loadshedding or any power-related glitches.
Moreover, he explains, there’s an option for a hybrid set-up also wherein electrical equipment such as iron, washing machine, an air conditioner etc meant for brief usage are converted to Wapda, and the rest consumes solar energy; this option reduces the monthly bill by at least 30 per cent. “The advantages of solar power system are clean energy consumption, no shutdowns or outages during the day (in a hybrid system), and easily available equipment,” Dr Gara adds.
Meanwhile, solar service providers want the government to assist them as well as the potential consumers by offering financing schemes and tax exemptions to encourage expansion of the user base.
Daniyal Siddiqui, the CEO of DS Group of Companies that offers solar and wind energy solutions, comments: “The government introduced a refinancing scheme on 6pc interest for houses, but we’ve heard the facility may end soon. The sales tax exemption on solar panels has also been withdrawn under the recently announced mini budget that will affect the domestic market. So the authorities must make sure these continue,” he stresses.
Admitting that solar system is still a high-end product, he suggests that besides finance schemes, the government must also focus on easing approvals for net-metering and considering installing assembly or manufacturing plants here. “The current loans offered are difficult to avail, so they should be made easy. Net-metering approvals are also cumbersome as Discos take a long time. Since 99 per cent of the technology used is imported from China, the government should look at establishing assembly or manufacturing plant here.”

13,Rising from the rubble: the 2015 Sundar factory collapse,"Six years ago on a crisp November day, a group of workers in the afternoon shift at Rajput Polyester dispersed for...","Six years ago on a crisp November day, a group of workers in the afternoon shift at Rajput Polyester dispersed for the Maghrib prayers. The 30,000-square foot factory was located in a busy neighbourhood within Sundar Industrial Estate, located 45 kilometres from Lahore’s epicentre.
Around 5pm, with nearly 150 workers inside the premises,the two-storey building came crashing down.
The collapse was theworst industrial disasterin Pakistan since the 2012 factory fires in Karachi and Lahore, and killed 45 people while injuring roughly one hundred others. What followed were grim accounts of suffering: on-site amputations, victims perishing in the arms of rescue workers, and the lingering cries of trapped workers.
So what happened after the Rajput Polyester factory came tumbling down and disappeared from public consciousness?

It appeared unexpected to some, as Sundar Industrial Estate remains one of the country’s most acclaimed industrial park projects.
“I never expected such news from Sundar,” says Tariq Mehmood, a steel fabricator with a unit inside the estate, “Sundar introduced a facilitative culture where you weren’t being quibbled by corrupt officers and bureaucratic red tape at each turn.”
In the immediate aftermath of the rescue operation, one question lingered on everyone’s mind: who is to be held responsible?The obvious scapegoat was Rana Ashraf, the factory owner who died in the collapse;it is now believed that Mr Ashraf was aware of cracks that had recently emerged in the building’s concrete structure owing to persistent vibrations from the newly installed machinery on the top floor.
After many weeks, the investigative committee set up by the then chief minister Shehbaz Sharif implicated a number of individuals, including Ashraf, his architect and some of the individuals involved in the map approval process.

“This won’t solve anything” was the indubitable consensus during a series of deliberations among the estate’s Board of Management consisting of a scattershot of resident industrialists.
Taking days at a stretch away from their businesses, the board members started a campaign to convince their peers that real change was needed.
The message was rudimentary, yet effective: we can blame bureaucrats, government officials and policymakers all we want, but nothing changes until we – the manufacturers, industrialists, businessmen -- mend our ways.
The consensus was: structure stability certificates, seen for too long as another layer of bureaucratic red-tapism, must not be delayed or circumvented; building by-laws, generally deemed ungainly hurdles to growth, will no longer be negotiated; and any action that jeopardizes occupational safety in the pursuit of profit, will be penalized.
“Buy it”, spurted an influential member during an informal committee meeting, visibly shaken by a debate on the justification of purchasing international standard safety apparatus “even if there is no precedent set by other agencies. If it saves even one life, it is worth it”.
‘One life’ usually does not tip the scales in a city like Lahore, plagued with bomb blasts and police encounters for more than a decade, but it did on that day.
There were some reform attempts at the provincial and national level, leading to increased activity within risk mitigation and disaster response bodies. Industrial and labour rights non-profits also sprung into action, and for a few months at least, there seemed at least some seriousness of intent.

Yet, there are countless stories that will never get the spotlight.
There were the resident factories that fed, bathed, and warmed the rescue workers for weeks without any recognition. There was the team of army surgeons, who volunteered to perform onsite surgeries without rest.
And the dozens of firefighters, who would never be honoured. There would be no crowd-sourced fundraisers to raise money for their children’s educations nor any monuments to commemorate their bravery.
Of course, there were those too who chose to profit from tragedy.
Not long after the disaster, this writer was approached by a gentleman named Aslam, who claimed to be a protégé of the deceased factory owner. He was convinced that he held a generous ownership stake in the factory. Unable to make headway, he smiled, shook hands and never showed up again.
Then there was the retired army officer, who was sent to help clean up the debris from the site as a charitable action. Later, it transpired that he aimed to make some bucks by selling offwhatever machinery or valuables he could salvage from the rubble.

A quick drive through the industrial estate today, with its sprawling green public parks, large digital displays, and modern minimalist facades, you’d think the events of Nov 4, 2015 are all but forgotten.
But, as you cut across the main artery and see the fire tenders and rescue vehicles lined up in front of an imposing building marked ‘Industrial Safety Unit’ in large acrylic letters,a glimmer of hope arises that perhaps, on this rare occasion, a lesson has been learnt.

He said the NPO was assigned a task by the prime minister to involve the expert engineers of the organisation for adopting energy conservation and other latest techniques in the production operations of the cutlery sector.
The NPO team briefed the participants about the working of the organisation and emphasised the need for controlling the rising cost of doing business for which the manufacturers would be asked to use certain instruments to minimise the energy consumption.
Moreover, the expert engineers of NPO would also work along the local manufacturers to teach them about enhancing production capacity by using the same available machinery at these manufacturing units.
The members of cutlery association also asked the NPO team to help the manufacturers in establishing new workshops at recently-built Wazirabad small industries estate area where manufacturers are ready to launch new factories in the near future so that the required equipment and machinery might be installed timely.
They also sought the guidance of NPO in capacity building of the cutlery sector to be on a par with the competitors in global market such as China, Taiwan, India and Vietnam etc that would contribute to the national economic growth.
Wazirabad has been a house of at least 1,500-2,000 mostly small and medium scale cutlery manufacturing units but lacks in adopting modern design and technology for which the sector needs government support to be on a par with other competitors in the global markets.

NAROWAL: Several areas of the city remain submerged with sewage as the mega sewerage project has been shut down for three years due to unavailability of funds.
The Municipal Committee staff has failed to open sewerage lines. Pir Syed Mazharul Hassan aka Chan Pir, a member of Punjab Assembly elected from Narowal city, had laid underground sewerage pipelines while carrying out development work in the city way back in 1987. The diameter of the underground sewerage pipe was only 18 inches and it provided drainage facility to the citizens for 15 years.
The system, however, was shut down owing to growing population and a lack of regular cleaning of sewerage lines. In 2005, the Tehsil Municipal Administration due to a lack of development funds constructed open drainage system along the roads. The city’s sewerage system was improved and worked until 2014 when open drainage canals were closed with cement. Mohallah Hajwair Colony, Chowkandi, Main Bazaar, Khwajagan, Abubakarpura, Rasoolpura, Girls College Road and dozens of streets were affected.
In 2017, Ahsan Iqbal launched a mega sewerage project at a cost of Rs180 million. The project of laying six-foot diameter sewerage pipe started from Chan Pir Road in the middle of Narowal city and work began on regular plan for discharge of sewage effluent in Defence drain near Plot Reb village.

During the two years, the Department of Public Health Engineering laid about one kilometre sewerage pipe underground. The PTI government cut off funds for the construction of the project.
People have been facing inconvenience while using roads and streets. Mohammad Rafiq and Ali Asghar said it was difficult to move out of homes because of stench and sewage. “We and our children wade through dirty water to reach schools and offices,” they said.
Municipal Committee chairman Pir Syed Azharul Hassan said the mega sewerage project had been closed owing to unavailability of funds.
He said this mega sewerage project was an ideal project in which there was no need for disposal stations and water turbines. The sewerage system was to operate on a 12-foot natural flow from the city and there was no need for a new system for the next 50 years had this project been completed.
The citizens have demanded Chief Minister Usman Buzdar to provide funds for the project in Narowal so that the citizens could be protected from dirt and diseases.
