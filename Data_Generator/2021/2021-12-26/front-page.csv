• Arrangements in place to get the entire package approved by cabinet
• Move to ensure sixth review of $6bn EFF gets cleared on Jan 12
• Tarin says measures agreed with Fund as prior actions completed 
ISLAMABAD: The government on Saturday said it would introduce the Finance (Supplementary) Bill 2021 and the State Bank of Pakistan (Amendment) Bill 2021 in the parliament for approval on Tuesday to ensure its sixth review of the $6 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) gets cleared by the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) executive board on Jan 12, paving the way for the disbursement of about $1bn tranche. 
Finance and Revenue Adviser Shaukat Tarin told Dawn that all fiscal, monetary and reform measures agreed with the IMF as prior actions had been completed. All arrangements were in place to ensure that the entire package — including the supplementary finance and State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) bills — is approved by the cabinet during its meeting on Tuesday. 
“We will take it to the parliament the same day in the afternoon,” he said. 
Read: Sovereignty vs autonomy
An official earlier said the government was ready to get the Finance (Supplementary) Bill 2021 passed by the National Assembly to ensure there is reasonable time before the IMF board’s meeting. The Fund’s directors traditionally require two weeks to review the memorandum of economic and fiscal policy measures. 
Mr Tarin committed to the IMF that Pakistan will complete all five “prior actions” before requesting for a meeting of the board of directors to approve the revival of $6bn EFF suspended in April this year. 
Under those prior actions, the government, through the supplementary finance bill will, effect a net fiscal adjustment of almost Rs550bn during the remaining part of the current fiscal year through a 22 per cent cut in development funds, about Rs360bn worth of withdrawal of tax exemptions with a revised tax target of Rs6.1 trillion and increase in petroleum levy on major petroleum products by Rs4 per litre per month. 
Making an upfront announcement about the five prior actions to secure approval of the IMF board for the disbursement of about $1.06bn and revival of the IMF programme in January, Mr Tarin said recently the government would also ensure “approval” of the parliament to grant autonomy on matters of monetary policy, exchange rate and recruitments to the SBP, which would remain answerable to the parliament as it was now. 
These prior actions included State Bank of Pakistan (Amendment) Bill, withdrawal of tax exemptions and increase in energy tariff. The action pertaining to tariff adjustment has already been taken while bills to end tax exemptions and give autonomy to the SBP have been finalised. 
Under the supplementary finance bill, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) is seeking amendments to all the three key tax laws relating to customs, sales tax and income tax, besides the services tax law for the federal capital. 
The underlying purpose of the reform exercise, as pushed through by the international lenders, is to “rebuild the tax system on ideal principles of taxation and without any distortions” as far-reaching structural and administrative reforms had already been initiated by the present government to “achieve economic and financial stability through inclusive reforms and sustainable economic growth”. 
In terms of revenue generation, withdrawal of exemptions and removal of different rates under the sales tax law appear to be the biggest sources of additional tax. There is a long list running in hundreds of items that would attract higher sales tax rates and application of fresh tax. 
“Under the Sales Tax Act 1990, zero-rating under the Fifth Schedule is proposed to be streamlined and certain entries are to be withdrawn,” documents suggest. “Exemption regime under Sixth Schedule is proposed to be curtailed including the pharmaceutical sector and restricted to import and local supply of essential commodities only.” 
Moreover, “reduced rates of sales tax under Eighth Schedule on certain items are proposed to be streamlined in order to achieve equity in the tax system”. 
There are hundreds of items in the schedule on which different sales tax rates at 1pc, 2pc, 5pc, 6pc, 7pc, 8pc, 10pc and 12pc are applicable at present instead of the standard sales tax rate of 17pc. 
“Likewise, sales tax on the import of completely built high-end mobile phones under Ninth Schedule is proposed to be rationalised,” the FBR chairman said, adding that the “scope of Tier-I retailers is also proposed to be rationalised”. 
Under the Islamabad Capital Territory (Tax on Services) Ordinance 2001, a few notifications issued from time to time prescribing reduced rates in respect of some services were not consolidated, which is now being done in the schedule to the ordinance. 
The summary reports that “minimal amendments in the Income Tax Ordinance 2001 are aimed at promoting digital economy, documentation and facilitation measures”. Additionally, advance tax on foreign drama serials is proposed to be introduced and slightly enhanced on cellular services. 
Disclosure of information in respect of high-level public officials is proposed in the income tax law in line with the requirements of the development partners, rule of law and integrity.

1,Islamabad reports first Omicron case,"ISLAMABAD: After its detection in Karachi almost a fortnight ago, Omicron surfaced in Islamabad on Saturday after a...","ISLAMABAD: After its detection in Karachi almost a fortnight ago, Omicron surfaced in Islamabad on Saturday after a person was found infected by Covid-19’s most virulent strain. 
Pakistan reported its first suspected case of Omicron on Dec 8, which was later confirmed by the National Institute of Health (NIH) on Dec 13. 
The patient is a 47-year-old man who had arrived from Karachi in the current week. As many as 10 of his contacts have been quarantined and their samples collected for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. 
Besides, contact tracing has also been planned in the two educational institutions of the federal capital where the man’s children are studying. 
A tweet from Deputy Commissioner (DC) Islamabad Hamza Shafqaat’s office on Saturday confirmed the arrival of the virus in the federal capital. 
“First case of #OmicronVariant detected in Islamabad. The patient has travel history from Karachi. We are tracing all his contacts now. Everyone plz get vaccinated and follow SOPs,” the DC Office tweeted. 
On the other hand, District Health Officer (DHO) Islamabad Dr Zaeem Zia, in his tweet, advised the city’s residents to get immunised and also go for the booster dose to minimise chances of infection. However, he did not mention that an Omicron patient had been reported in the capital. 
“Amidst the looming threats of #Omicron variant, Our Health teams are prepared to respond as they did in previous waves/variants diligently. We urge everyone to follow SoP’s and get vaccinated if you arent, or get the booster if you are eligible ASAP. @nhsrcofficial #Omicron,” Dr Zia tweeted. 
Later, talking to Dawn, Dr Zia confirmed that Omicron had been detected in a resident who did not have a travel history to any other country. 
“We are ready to deal with the virus just like we did in the past. I just want to suggest people to get inoculated and strictly adhere to the standard operating procedures. Those who are eligible for a booster dose should get it at the earliest,” he said. 
Meanwhile, an official of the Ministry of National Health Services, requesting not to be named, said the 47 year-old man had developed symptoms following which his samples were collected four days ago and sent to the NIH for PCR test. 
“The NIH team found the PCR test’s strain a bit different, therefore, decided to send the sample for genome sequencing. After three days it was confirmed that the patient was Omicron positive,” the official said, adding that since the patient had minor symptoms and had not developed any complication, he (patient) was quarantined at his residence. 
He further added that the patient had interacted with 10 contacts after arriving from Karachi, and all of them had been isolated, quarantined and their samples collected for PCR tests. 
The official said as per the standard operating procedures, relevant authorities of Sindh were informed about it with an advice to conduct contact tracing to prevent the virus from spreading. 
“However, it is a matter of concern for us that his children are studying in two educational institutions in Islamabad; it has therefore been decided that contact tracing in institutions be carried out on Monday (tomorrow),” he added.    
When asked whether contact tracing will be done even if the patient’s children were found negative, the official said the incubation period of the virus was one week therefore chances of false negative result could not be ignored.  
It is worth mentioning here that during the current week, 12 suspected cases of the Omicron strain were reported in Balochistan. Their samples were sent to the NIH for confirmation through genome sequencing.  
Last month, Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Asad Umar and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health Dr Faisal Sultan had said that the arrival of the Omicron variant was inevitable. 
The strain was initially reported in South Africa and has now reached around 100 countries. 
On the other hand, the National Command and Operation Centre reported seven deaths and 353 new patients in the last 24 hours. The national positivity rate was calculated at 0.73pc and 624 patients were on critical care on Saturday. 
A total of 148,265,690 doses of vaccine have been administered across the country.

2,"Imran nominates new PTI office-bearers at centre, provinces","Fawad Chaudhry says the ""interim set-up"" will continue to function till the time the party has a new constitution.","ISLAMABAD: A day after dissolving the party’s organisational structure across the country, Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday nominated new office-bearers of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) at the central and provincial levels reviving the eight-year-old party structure.  
Mr Khan in his capacity as chairman of the party has appointed federal Minister for Planning and Development Asad Umar as central secretary general in place of MNA Aamer Mehmood Kiani, who has been made additional secretary general.  
The nominations were announced by federal Minister for Information Fawad Chaudhry through his official social media account on Twitter.  

 



 
According to Mr Chaudhry, federal Minister for Education and Professional Training Shafqat Mahmood has been made president of the party’s central Punjab chapter and federal Minister for Industries and Production Khusro Bakhtiar president of the PTI’s south Punjab chapter.  

Asad Umar to be central secretary general

Minister for Maritime Affairs Ali Zaidi has been made president of PTI Sindh whereas Defence Minister Pervez Khattak has been given the responsibility to reorganise the party in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa where the party recently suffered a defeat in the first phase of the local government elections. 
National Assembly Deputy Speaker Qasim Suri has been nominated as president of the PTI’s Balochistan chapter.  
After the general elections in 2013, the PTI had introduced new party structure under which Punjab and KP were divided into four regions each with no office-bearers at the province level. Later, the same structure based on regions was maintained in the new constitution adopted by the party in 2019 and Sindh and Balochistan were also divided into four regions.  
However, the new nominations show that Mr Khan has abolished the party’s organisational structure as given in the constitution and appointed office-bearers at the central and provincial level.   
There have been no changes in the party’s structures in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan chapters so far.  
Talking to Dawn, Mr Chaudhry said Imran Khan had made these nominations temporarily by using his special powers as the party chairman. He said this “interim set-up” would continue to function till the time the party had a new constitution for which a special constitutional committee had already been set up.  
The information minister said the first meeting of the constitution committee was held on Saturday which discussed the proposals for new constitution. He said the party found it necessary to amend the constitution after finding some loopholes in the previously agreed constitution.  
Soon after his nomination as the new secretary general of the PTI, Mr Umar tweeted that it was an “honour” for him to have a key position in the country’s largest political party.  
“Having an important position in Pakistan’s largest political party is an honour as well as a big responsibility. Under the leadership of Imran Khan and as per the expectations of the party workers and voters, the PTI will become more stronger,” tweeted Mr Umar, adding: “The workers of this party are its assets, the example of which is not found in any other party.”  

 



 
Similarly, Ali Zaidi in a tweet said he was “humbled by the faith” that the prime minister had shown in him and that he would try to live up to the expectations of all, especially PTI workers.  
“Together we will pull Sindh out of deprivation,” tweeted Mr Zaidi.  

 



 
The dissolution of previous PTI organisations had been announced by Mr Chaudhry in a press conference on Friday after a meeting of the party’s senior leadership that was presided over by the prime minister to review the party’s dismal performance in the local bodies elections in KP where the party has been ruling for more than eight years.  
In the meeting, Prime Minister Khan had constituted a 21-member committee to form a new structure of the party organisations and draft a new constitution.  
The committee comprises Pervez Khattak, Mahmood Khan, Murad Saeed, Asad Qaiser and Ali Amin Gandapur from KP; Fawad Chaudhry, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Hammad Azhar, Khusro Bakhtiar, Chaudhry Mohammad Sarwar, Saifullah Niazee, Amir Kayani and Sardar Usman Buzdar from Punjab; Mir Jan Mohammad Jamali and Qasim Suri from Balochistan, Imran Ismail and Ali Zaidi from Sindh and Asad Umar from Islamabad.  
Prime Minister Khan had blamed selection of wrong candidates for the party’s defeat in the first phase of the local government elections in KP and expressed the hope that the PTI would bounce back with strength in the second phase of the elections scheduled to be held next month. He had also claimed that he would himself monitor selection of party candidates for all LG polls to be held in the country in future.

3,"FIA frees occupied land in Lahore, Gujranwala",Agency seals three plazas in DHA Lahore worth Rs500 million.,"LAHORE: The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has retrieved federal government’s properties worth about Rs2.5 billion from illegal occupants in Lahore and Gujranwala. 
The agency has launched an operation against illegal occupation of Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) properties, nonpayment of rent for years and violation of lease contracts. 
An FIA team under the supervision of Lahore Director Mohammad Rizwan carried out the operation on Friday and Saturday along with the ETPB and police in Defence Housing Authority (DHA) and Model Town Lahore and Gujranwala city. 
The agency sealed three plazas in DHA Lahore – two in phase V and one in Y block phase III. “The worth of these plazas is Rs500 million. A property, 499-XX DHA Lahore, worth Rs50m has also been repossessed after eviction of the illegal occupants,” an FIA official told Dawn on Saturday. 
Furthermore, he said, a lessee of two residential properties in XX block DHA paid defaulted rent worth Rs9m on the spot. “The 200-kanal prime peri-urban ETPB land worth Rs300m has been retrieved from illegal occupants in Gujranwala city,” the official added. 
He further said 23 kanals illegally occupied for over 20 years for supposedly a school in C block, Model Town, Lahore had been retrieved and its worth was Rs1bn. Some 67 shops in B and C blocks in Model Town, Lahore worth Rs450m were also sealed for defaulting ETPB rent. 
“The total value of federal government properties retrieved over the last two days is around Rs2.5bn,” the official said, adding that the FIA’s operation would continue. 
“However, some urban ETPB properties allotted to the front men of influential politicians and journalists in Lahore and elsewhere in the province have either defaulted, violated the lease agreement or illegally sold, but have yet to face action,” a source privy to the development told Dawn. He said the ETPB heads appointed by the PPP and PML-N were involved in allotting this land to oblige politicians and journalists. 
The FIA recently registered 12 first information reports (FIRs) against two former ETPB chiefs -- Asif Hashmi and Siddiqul Farooq, 15 incumbent and five retired officials over their role in illegal award of urban properties on lease or their sale. Mr Farooq and Mr Hashmi are associated with the PML-N and PPP, respectively. 
Most of the FIRs had been registered under sections 409 (criminal breach of trust, dishonest misappropriation of property), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), and 109 (abatement) of the PPC r/w 5(2)47 PCA. 
A two-judge Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice Gulzar Ahmed had last month heard a petition filed by Pakistan Hindu Council patron Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani, who complained that the court’s directives about protection of properties belonging to minority communities were not being implemented. The court ordered the FIA to conduct an inquiry.

4,Termination of service on verbal order illegal: SC,"Termination of service by a verbal order is against the principle of good governance, Justice Mazhar observes.","ISLAMABAD: No emplo­yer can terminate the services of its employees on mere verbal instructions without any written order containing explicit reasons or cause for termination, the Supreme Court has held. 
Authored by Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar, a verdict issued by the apex court emphasised that there was no provision under the Labour Laws or the Service Laws permitting the employer to terminate the services verbally without a written order containing “explicit reasons or cause of termination or for disciplinary proceedings on account of misconduct”. 
The judgement explained that a separate procedure had been laid down for proper termination of services, which accentuated the issuance of show-cause notice, holding of inquiry unless dispensed with by the competent authority considering all attending circumstances of the case that too after personal hearing. 
Justice Mazhar observed that termination of service by a verbal order was alien to labour and service laws and also against the principle of good governance, which was a process of gauging whether the government, its departments/institutions and authorities were conducting their affairs lawfully and performing their duties honestly, conscientiously and transparently including their process of decision making in accordance with rules and regulations. 

Apex court upholds service tribunal’s decision against agriculture policy institute

The observation came on an appeal against the Sept 2, 2020 order of the Federal Service Tribunal (FST) that had directed the Agriculture Policy Institute (API) to reinstate Zulqarnain Ali as driver after setting aside ‘verbal termination order’.  
The Supreme Court bench that heard the matter comprised Chief Justice of Pakistan Gulzar Ahmed, Justice Mazhar Alam Khan Miankhel and Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar. 
Initially, driver Zulqarnain Ali had been engaged on a daily wage basis in April 2011 for 89 days and the period was extended multiple times. Lastly, he was appointed on Jan 11, 2012 by the API chairman through an office order of the deputy director (admin) along with four other persons on a daily wage basis for a period of 89 days. 
The judgement recalled that a May 31, 2012 minutes of the cabinet sub-committee convened for dealing with the cases for Regularisation of Contract and Daily Wages Employees performing their duties in the different ministries, divisions, attached departments, autonomous bodies and organisations in the establishment division and after due deliberation, the cabinet sub-committee decided and approved the regularization of their services. 
Subsequently the services of 38 contract employees and 16 daily wage earners of the food security and research ministry, 275 daily wage earners of the National Agricultural Research Centre (NARC) and 77 daily wage workers of the Pakistan Agriculture Research Council were regularized, subject to availability of posts on non-development budget and fulfillment of recruitment criterion. 
So far as the contract employees of API, the services of seven contractual employees were regularized including the driver. After his services were terminated, driver Zulqarnain approached the FST where it was revealed that his services were terminated through a verbal order in the month of July 2012. 
The driver initially filed a departmental appeal on July 31, 2012 that was rejected by the API on Jan 4, 2019. As a last resort, the driver approached to the FST. 
Justice Mazhar observed in his judgement that the verbal termination order was ‘illegal’, hence the FST rightly set aside the termination order with the directions to the petitioners to reinstate the driver with back benefits and also dealt with the intervening period aptly. 
According to the judgement, the verbal termination order is against the principle of natural justice that turn of phrase was originated from the Roman word ‘Jus Naturale’, which means principles and moralities of natural law, justice, equity, and good conscience that, is fervently and exuberantly founded in the judicial conscience. 
It is an elementary rule of law that before taking any adverse action, the affected party must be given a fair opportunity to respond and defend the action. This principle does not lay down any differentiation or inequality between a quasi-judicial function and or an administrative function/action for applying evenly and uniformly to secure justice and prevent miscarriage of justice, Justice Mazhar observed. 
Before taking any punitive or adverse action, putting to end the services of any employee/workman or civil servant, the precept of fairness and reasonableness commands that an even-handed opportunity to put forth the defence should be afforded. 
Due to negligent and unprofessional practice or conduct of issuing verbal termination orders of service, the action of employer is often defeated and non-suited in the court of law without touching the merits of the case despite having sometimes valid grounds for termination of service, the judgement said, adding that in order to avoid such anomalies and eventualities, even in the case of contractual or temporary engagements, the employees should be issued appointment letters in writing with the terms and conditions of engagement and in the case of termination, explicit reasons of termination should be assigned.
