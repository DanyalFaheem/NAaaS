0,"EPA without permanent chief, policymaking body",The KP government recently removed the DG and assigned the office to a non-technical person.,"PESHAWAR: At a time when the climate-related threats are multiplying across the region, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) faces a near meltdown and is unable to perform its regulatory duties as the environmental watchdog.
The EPA is currently rudderless without a permanent director general and Environmental Protection Council, which is responsible for framing environmental related policies for the implementation of provincial environmental quality standards.
The provincial government recently removed the DG and assigned the office to a non-technical person (a bureaucrat).
The council has not held a single meeting since the promulgation of the Environmental Protection Act, 2014.

Official says all set for air quality monitoring, polluters to get notices on spot

Under the act, chief minister is the chairperson of the 18-memebr council.
According to officials, the maiden meeting of the council was convened in Oct 2020.
Chief Minister Mahmood Khan had asked environment minister Syed Ishtiaq Urmar, who serves as the co-chairperson of the council to preside over the meeting in his absence. The government has so far only notified members of the council.
“All of a sudden, the then chief secretary cancelled the meeting although he (CS) has no powers either to call or cancel the meeting,” revealed an official.
He said that under the law, the government would notify district environmental protection councils across the province. The council will approve environmental policies and EPA will act as an executing body to implement policies and guidelines.
The act says that the council shall hold meetings, as and when necessary, but at least one meeting shall be held in a year and its main functions are approval of comprehensive environmental policies, action plans and ensure their implementation and approval of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Environmental Quality Standards.
Established in 1989, the EPA was placed under the environment department in 2001. According to the act, the authority’s main objectives are to protect, conserve, rehabilitate and improve environment, control pollution and promote sustainable development in the province.
From an agency that enjoyed much prominence in the provincial scheme of things in 1990s due to focus on environmental issues, the EPA figures nowhere in terms of relevance today as funds dwindle alongside interest of the bureaucracy as well as the government in improving its performance and impact.
Officials told Dawn that the authority was dormant due to multiple reasons.
According to the act, the EPA shall publish annual environmental report on the state of the environment in the province, but no report has so far been compiled. Instead of publishing annual report, the EPA launched the environmental profile of the province in 2018.
Sources said that the government had allocated Rs15 million for the authority in the 2020-21 annual development programme to publish the second environmental profile but the task was not accomplished and therefore, the funds lapsed.
On the other hand, air quality monitoring equipment donated by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), which was installed on the rooftop of the EPA building, is out of order.
Sources said the equipment repair costs totaled Rs2.4 million.
“The EPA is unable to monitor air quality of Peshawar and only updates about the provincial capital air quality are available from a small station installed at foreign diplomatic mission,” said one source.
He said that a few years ago, the foreign mission had offered to donate the air quality monitoring machine to the EPA, but the offer was turned down for security reasons.
“Currently, the EPA needs at least four mobile stations to check air quality on daily basis in Peshawar,” he said.
Sources said that the EPA soil, air and water lab had been set up in Sherabad area on the outskirts of the city adjacent to Mohmand tribal district.
They said that the lab couldn’t function regularly as the area remained without power supply for hours due to the prolonged loadshedding.
The sources said that the authority had decided to shift the lab to the Pakistan Forest Institute located on the University Campus and allocated space for it.
A senior official told Dawn requesting anonymity that the authority was faced with many issues.
He, however, said efforts were under way to revive the EPA.
The official said the authority would begin air quality monitoring next week from the Hayatabad industrial estate, while mobile teams would start visiting Hayatabad industrial estate and serve notices on polluters on the spot.
He said steps were being taken to expedite environmental impact assessment for industrial units.
“We will formally ask the chief minister to chair the Council meeting after the authority makes some progress,” he said.

4,KP to begin coronavirus booster vaccination tomorrow,"Official says people above 50 years and with low immunity, health workers to be given priority.","PESHAWAR: The health department will begin the coronavirus booster vaccination for the fully immunised people in the province tomorrow (Monday) amid a dip in deaths from the virus.
According to officials, one person lost life to Covid-19 and 37 were infected with it in the province on Saturday.
They told Dawn that the people fully vaccinated against Covid-19 could go to the immunisation centres directly to receive booster dose.
The officials said the department had so far administered first dose of coronavirus vaccine to 13 million (50 per cent) of the 24.47 million targeted population above 12 years of age, while the fully vaccinated population was 12 million (40 per cent).

Official says people above 50 years and with low immunity, health workers to be given priority

“The people, who had received Covid-19 vaccine six months ago, are eligible for booster vaccination. All immunised people will get Pfizer booster jabs regardless of the vaccines they got earlier,” an official said.
He said vaccination was an ongoing process, which would continue until the virus was around.
The official said there was no indication that Covid-19 would vanish anytime soon, so the only option for the people to live normal life was to ensure full vaccination.
“New variants of coronavirus are emerging and the situation can become more dangerous if the people continue to ignore the need for vaccination,” he said.
The other officials said priority for booster vaccination would be accorded to the people above 50 years of age, healthcare workers, and immunity-compromised people.
They, however, said all other visitors to the vaccination centres would also receive jabs.
The officials said the health department faced daunting the coronavirus-related challenges in many districts, where vaccination rate was very low.
They said the National Command and Operation Centre had made vaccination mandatory and therefore, all the people would ultimately be given vaccine jabs.
The officials said private schools were part of the problem due to very low rates of vaccination of students and staff members.
They said the health department had been requesting the relevant authorities to persuade the managements of private schools for vaccination saying unvaccinated people could be sources of virus transmission.
“Vaccination hesitancy is a big issue. The health department is trying its best to convince the defiant population about immunisation against coronavirus for themselves and others as without getting jabs, we cannot return to normal life,” an official told Dawn.
He said the Covid-19 variants from UK, India and South Africa were detected in the province during the last few months and there were fears about the people being infected with the latest deadly one, Omicron, and therefore, booster vaccination was highly important to enhance immunity against the virus.
“We are focusing on vaccination and testing of suspects, and tracing relatives and friends of the positive cases for necessary measures,” he said.
The officials said the government had relaxed Covid-19 restrictions throughout the province but the use of face mask, social distancing and hand washing was compulsory.
On Saturday, the health department said in a report that a man died of coronavirus in the province, while 37 new cases of the virus were reported taking the province’s tally of deaths to 5,922 and that of cases to 181,204.
According to it, 174,678 (96 per cent) of the infected people have recovered from the virus, while the active cases in the province total 604.
The department said only Peshawar, the epicentre of Covid-19, continued to record fatalities and incidence.
It said 149 patients were admitted to Covid-19 wards in the local hospitals, including 15 critical ones, who were on ventilator.
The department said the daily coronavirus infection rate had been below 50 and that of deaths two per day since Dec 18.

The media and communication department of the Karakoram International University organised the event titled ‘suicide awareness and prevention and media reporting’.
Dr Khalil Ahmed, the KIU acting vice-chancellor, suggested organising seminars, debates and counselling sessions to develop a mechanism to prevent suicides in GB. He said students of the university should play their role in creating awareness among local residents about the grave issue.
On the occasion, local mediapersons said suicide cases were increasing across the region, but no research or study to identify the reasons behind the incidence had been conducted.
They said according to informal data available over 1,000 people, majority of them women, had committed suicide in Ghizer and Hunza districts from 2010 to 2018. They said a big number of such cases were never reported.
They demanded setting up a helpline to trace the causes of suicides, saying it was pathetic that GB had neither any shelter home for accommodating women victims of violence or family courts to provide them relief.

The function in this regard was attended by a large number of team members, including Malik Rehan Afridi along with Haq Parast supporters from Darra Adamkhel tribal subdivision, the women wing’s campaign leader Rehana Baji and workers from all the four tehsils of Kohat.
A cake was also cut by the team members at the function held at the hujra of Malik Iqbal where he said that he had resigned from the seat of district president three months ago after realising that injustice was being done with the ideological workers. He also referred to imposition of a particular ‘mafia’ of lawmakers and influential party leaders on them.
About health facilities in Kohat city, Mr Iqbal said Sangerh hospital was being run by an NGO and Liaquat Memorial Hospital (LMH) had been demolished for its reconstruction, which was inaugurated by former CM Pervez Khattak, MNA Shehryar Afridi and MPA Ziaullah Bangash in 2018.
He said that about Rs1.2 billion had been announced for construction of its new building, but after raising pillars the work was lying suspended since 2019. The KDA hospital is without MRI, CT Scan and other essential facilities and patients were being referred to Peshawar.
Mr Iqbal said they would put pressure on the chairmen for solution of problems of the district especially related to provision of gas, drinking water and health facilities.
Rehan Afridi claimed that he had been offered Rs5 million to withdraw his nomination in favour of PTI candidate in Darra Adam khel, but he refused though elections had to be cancelled there.
He urged the participants to attend the Haq Parast convention to be held in Dara Adam khel and show their power to the opponents.
PTI activist Shafi Jan, who got 27,000 votes as an independent candidate for city tehsil chairman slot, announced that the annoyed party workers would contest the 2023 elections under the banner of Haq Parast group.

10,Importance of technology highlighted for reducing post-harvest losses,PESHAWAR: The agronomy department of the University of Agriculture in collaboration with the University of...,"PESHAWAR: The agronomy department of the University of Agriculture in collaboration with the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, organised a training workshop on ‘dry chain technology’ for reducing post-harvest losses in seeds here on Saturday.
The training organiser Prof Mohammad Arif explained the concept of dry chain technology and its importance. He said even as increasing population put pressure on food supplies, about one-third of the total food produced for human consumption was wasted, with the majority of loss in developing countries occurring between harvest and the consumer. Retaining product dryness is the most critical factor for maintaining quality in stored non-perishable foods.
The high relative humidity prevalent in humid climates elevates the moisture content of dried commodities stored in porous woven bags, enabling fungal and insect infestations, he explained.
Prof Arif said mycotoxins (aflatoxin) produced by fungi in insufficiently dried food commodities affected 4.5 billion people worldwide. He added the term ‘dry chain’ was used to describe initial dehydration of durable commodities to levels preventing fungal growth followed by storage in moisture-proof containers.
This is analogous to the ‘cold chain’ in which continuous refrigeration is used to preserve quality in the fresh produce industry. However, in the case of the dry chain, no further equipment or energy input is required to maintain product quality after initial drying as long as the integrity of the storage container is preserved, he maintained, saying in some locations/seasons, only packaging was required to implement a ‘climate smart’ dry chain, while in humid conditions, additional drying was required and desiccant-based drying methods had unique advantages.
Dr Irfan Afzal from the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, presented both climate and drying-based approaches to implement the dry chain to minimise mycotoxin accumulation and insect infestations in dry products, reduce food loss, improve food quality, safety and security, and protect public health. He also gave hands-on training to the participants for better understanding of the concept and practical demonstration.
University of Agriculture Vice-Chancellor Prof Jehan Bakht, who was the chief guest, advised heads of other departments of the varsity to also arrange such workshops, according to a press release.
The participants included students, faculty members, research officers, agriculture officers, and representatives of the seed companies. They were given certificates at the end of the training workshop.
