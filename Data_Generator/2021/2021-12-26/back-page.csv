0,Saudi-led force launches Yemen assault after two killed in kingdom,Pakistan assails air strike on target in Saudi Arabia’s Jazan region,"RIYADH: The Saudi-led coalition on Saturday launched a “large-scale” assault on Yemen after missiles fired by Iran-backed Houthi rebels killed two people in the kingdom, the first such deaths in three years. 
The Houthis warned Yemen’s oil-rich northern neighbour of a “painful” response if the coalition does not stop its “aggression” against the conflict-riven country. 
Yemen has been wracked by civil war since 2014, pitting the internationally recognised government supported by the Saudi-led military coalition against the Houthis who control much of the north. 
Tens of thousands of people have since been killed, in what the UN has described as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. 
The latest violence came overnight when two people — one Saudi and the other Yemeni — were killed in the projectile attack on Jazan, said Saudi Arabia’s civil defence. 

Pakistan assails air strike on target in Saudi Arabia’s Jazan region

“A military projectile fell on a commercial store on the main street, resulting in two deaths,” it said, adding six Saudis and a Bangladeshi national were wounded. 
Images from the official Saudi Press Agency purportedly of the aftermath of the attack showed a large crater in the ground and destroyed vehicles. 
The Saudi-led coalition said shortly afterwards that it was “preparing for a large-scale military operation”. 
It later launched an air strike in which “three civilians including a child and a woman were killed, and six others were wounded”, Yemeni medics said. The coalition will hold a news conference on Sunday to address the latest developments, the Saudi authorities said. 
Houthi spokesman Yahya Saree warned Saudi Arabia of “painful operations as long as it continues its aggression and crimes”. 
In a statement on the Houthis’ Telegram channel, he said the rebels had launched three ballistic missiles on Jazan, a southern region of the kingdom bordering Yemen. 
The insurgents often launch missiles and drones into Saudi Arabia, targeting its airports and oil infrastructure. 
The latest was the first in more than three years that has resulted in fatalities in the kingdom, which recorded its first death from a Houthi missile attack when a missile struck Riyadh in 2018. 
It also comes as fighting between the two sides intensifies, with the coalition ramping air strikes on Sanaa. 
Saudi Arabia and its ally the United States have long accused Iran of supplying the Houthis with sophisticated weapons, a charge the Islamic republic denies. 
The US Navy said this week that it seized 1,400 AK-47 rifles and ammunition from a fishing boat it claimed was smuggling weapons from Iran to the Houthis, who are from Yemen’s Zaidi Shia minority. 
“The stateless vessel was assessed to have originated in Iran and transited international waters along a route historically used to traffic weapons unlawfully to the Houthis in Yemen,” it said. 
On Thursday — a day after the coalition targeted a Houthi military camp in Sanaa — the military alliance said it shot down a bomb-laden drone near Abha airport in the south of the kingdom, causing debris to fall nearby but leaving no casualties. 
The UN estimates Yemen’s war will have claimed 377,000 lives by the end of the year through both direct and indirect impacts. 
More than 80 per cent of Yemen’s population of about 30 million requires humanitarian assistance in what the UN says is world’s worst humanitarian crisis. 
Missile attack condemned Pakistan criticised on Saturday the ballistic missiles attack on a target in Saudi Arabia. 
In a statement, the spokesperson for the Foreign Office in Islamabad said: “Pakistan strongly condemns the launch of hostile projectiles by Houthis towards Samtah governorate in Jazan region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia that resulted in casualties, injuries and damage to civilian infrastructure. 
“Such attacks not only violate international law but also threaten peace and security of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the region. Pakistan calls for immediate cessation of these attacks.”  
Pakistan reaffirms its full support to and solidarity with the kingdom against any threats to its security and territorial integrity, added the statement.

1,Two ‘kidnappers’ killed in encounter in Quetta,Police say the slain men were involved in kidnapping the son of a businessman for ransom.,"QUETTA: Two suspected kidnappers of a businessman’s son were killed in an armed encounter with personnel of the Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) here on Saturday, police said. 
They said the two slain men were involved in the kidnapping of the son of a businessman for ransom and had demanded Rs30 million from his family for his release. They had kept the young man in a rented house in the city’s Eastern Bypass area. 
Police said they had arrested one of the alleged kidnappers, Abdul Sakhi, some time ago. On Saturday they took him to the ‘kidnappers’ place’ so that he might identify the other criminals. 
However, when the policemen reached near the place, the alleged kidnappers began firing on the CIA personnel. During the firing, the arrested suspect (Sakhi) received bullets from the other kidnappers and was killed, according to the source.  
Police claimed that in the retaliatory firing, the wanted accused, Ghousuddin, was also killed. However, two of his accomplices managed to escape from the scene. 
Senior police officer Akram Laghari said the ‘kidnappers’ had abducted Amanullah, a 23-year-old student, from the Sarki Kalan area of the provincial capital, two months ago. 
He said the accused later killed the young man as he had begun recognising them. Police had transferred the case to CIA for tracing the kidnappers. 
The CIA police traced Sakhi and arrested him on Nov 30. During interrogation, he had disclosed the whereabouts of the other accused and also revealed that the kidnapped young man had been slain.

2,"Exemptions allow US to deal with Taliban, Haqqani Network","Three general licenses have been issued allowing govt officials, international agencies to conduct ""official business"".","WASHINGTON: Three general licences issued by the US Treasury this week allow US government officials and international agencies to conduct “official business” with the Taliban and Haqqani Network. 
An official statement issued by the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) explains how this “official business” can be conducted. 
“General Licence 17 authorises all transactions and activities involving the Taliban or the Haqqani Network that are for the conduct of the official business of the US government by employees, grantees, or contractors thereof, subject to certain conditions. 
“General Licence 18 authorises all transactions and activities involving the Taliban or the Haqqani Network that are for the conduct of the official business of certain international organisations and other international entities by employees, grantees, or contractors thereof, subject to certain conditions. 
“General Licence 19 authorises all transactions and activities involving the Taliban or the Haqqani Network that are ordinarily incidental and necessary to the following activities by nongovernmental organisations (NGOs), subject to certain conditions.” 
The conditions are explained as aiding “humanitarian projects to meet basic human needs; activities to support rule of law, citizen participation, government accountability and transparency”. 
Organisations dealing with “human rights and fundamental freedoms, access to information, and civil society development projects” are also allowed to receive aid from US and other sources. 
The exemption also applies to “education; non-commercial development projects directly benefiting the Afghan people; and environmental and natural resource protection”.  
Earlier this week, the UN Security Council adopted a resolution to ease the delivery of humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. 
The resolution allowed “payment of funds, other financial assets or economic resources, and the provision of goods and services necessary to ensure the timely delivery of such assistance or to support such activities”. 
Later, White House press secretary Jen Psaki reminded journalists at a briefing that it was the United States that had drafted the resolution. She pointed that the resolution had its own mechanism to filter the pledged aid as it “requests periodic updates by the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator to ensure assistance is reaching the intended beneficiaries”. 
After the Aug 15 Taliban takeover, the international community froze Afghanistan’s assets to ensure that the Taliban did not access the funds, which brought the Afghan economy close to a collapse. The UN resolution and the exemptions intend to prevent the possible collapse. 
The United States froze nearly $9.5bn of Afghan assets in August but it’s not clear if the exemptions would ultimately lead to the release of these frozen assets as well. 
Republican lawmakers, however, have warned that the move risks legitimising funding the Taliban leaders as they would be the ultimate beneficiary.

3,Burnt remains of 30 found in Myanmar,Myanmar has been in chaos since a coup in February.,"BANGKOK: The charred remains of more than 30 people, including women and children, were found in burnt-out vehicles in Myanmar on Saturday, a rebel group and a monitor said, accusing the junta of the attack. 
Myanmar has been in chaos since a coup in February, with more than 1,300 people killed in a crackdown by security forces, according to a local monitoring group. 
“People’s Defence Forces” (PDF) have sprung up across the country to fight the junta, and have drawn the military into a bloody stalemate of clashes and reprisals. 
On Saturday, photos appeared on social media purporting to show two burnt-out trucks and a car on a highway in Hpruso township in eastern Kayah state, with the charred remains of bodies inside. 
A member of a local PDF group said its fighters had found the vehicles on Saturday morning after hearing the military had stopped several vehicles in Hpruso after clashes with its fighters nearby on Friday. 
“When we went to check in the area this morning, we found dead bodies burnt in two trucks. We found 27 dead bodies,” he said.
