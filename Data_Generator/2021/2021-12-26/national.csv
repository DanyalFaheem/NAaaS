0,"PTI workers resent dissolution of party structure, new formation",Party leaders say those who faltered should have been punished rather than putting everyone in the dock.,"LAHORE: Workers of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) have reacted sharply to Prime Minister Imran Khan’s decision of dissolving the party’s organisational structure and expressed concern over the appointment of federal ministers as new party officials whom they believe are the root cause of the debacle in the recent Khyber Pakhtunkhwa local government elections. 
Meanwhile, a federal minister said the PM has introduced the new structure to re-organise and reactivate the party so that active contact could be established with workers and voters at the grassroots. He further said the party model had also been changed. 
PM Khan, who is also the PTI chairman, has appointed Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Minister Asad Umar as the party’s central secretary general, former federal minister Amir Mahmood Kiyani as the additional secretary general, Education Minister Shafqat Mahmood as the Punjab president, Industries and Production Minister Khusro Bakhtiar as the south Punjab president, Defence Minister Pervaiz Khattak as the KP president, Maritime Affairs Minister Ali Zaidi as Sindh president and National Assembly Deputy Speaker Qasim Suri as the Balochistan president. 

Lament ministers’ appointment as new leaders despite failure in their respective jobs

Maintaining that only those who faltered should have been punished rather than putting everyone in the dock, party leaders say it was high time that their morale was boosted. “We are unable to understand the wisdom behind dissolving party organisations across the country by a high-powered core committee headed by party chairman Imran Khan,” a disgruntled party leader in Punjab said. 
Expressing fears over the decision, senior party leaders in Punjab were of the view that the PTI could face major challenges ahead of the upcoming local government elections and eventually the general elections, and dissolving functional systems would not help the party. 
“The party lost LG elections in KP because of the government’s failure to ensure clean governance and the mismanagement at the hands of top parliamentarians, who helped their favourites get tickets. But, instead the party organisers have been punished,” another senior leader lamented. 
Reacting to the appointment of federal ministers as party heads in the Centre and provinces, a PTI leader claimed these ministers had failed to justify their performance in their respective domains and had now been assigned additional duties. “The government functionaries have assumed political responsibilities too and apparently all issues will be resolved now,” a senior leader taunted. “Government functionaries were responsible for poor governance, but it’s the political workers who have been removed from their leadership roles with a stroke of a pen.” 
A founding member, who did not have a leadership role in the party, said the PTI comprised millions of members, but surprisingly some workers had been given multiple assignments. 
Reacting to the appointment of Shafqat Mahmood as the PTI Punjab president, a provincial leader said the party had lost the previous local government elections under the leadership of the education minister. 
When contacted, Mr Mahmood said the premier had created the new formation to re-organise and reactivate the party at grassroots. “We are here to reorganise the party to meet the future electoral challenges,” he said. 
The party, he said, would be re-organised at the district, tehsil and union council levels and involve all those active members who were earlier ignored. Mr Mahmood said the premier had changed the party model as well, as earlier there was no provincial president here, while now he had been appointed as the PTI’s Punjab president and Khusro Bakhtiar as the south Punjab head. 
“This kind of change will also be seen in the party’s reorganisation,” he added. 
To another question about him heading the PTI in Lahore when the party lost the LG elections, Mr Mahmood said, “There is a great difference between 2015 and 2021.” He claimed to have organised the party in Lahore very well and given tickets to candidates fairly. 
When contacted, Punjab government spokesman Hasaan Khawar said PM Khan had taken the decision of dissolving the party organisations to bring discipline and solving teething issues. There was a serious discussion in the party’s core committee on the issue and the decision was based on collective wisdom. “The already serving party leaders may get their slots back after review of the organisation,” he maintained.

1,PM shares rare snow leopard footage,The 45-second clip shows a snow leopard under a cliff and surrounded by snow.,"ISLAMABAD: Amid the ongoing government efforts for wildlife conservation through community invo­lve­ment and afforestation in the country, Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday shared a rare footage of a snow leopard roaming and roaring over the snowy mountains in the Khaplu area of Gilgit Baltistan. 
“Rare footage of the shy snow leopard in Khaplu, GB,” the prime minister captioned the 45-second video clip on Twitter showing the snow leopard under a cliff with snow all around.  

 



 

 



 
Also called the Ghosts of the Mountains, the snow leopards are shy and of elusive nature. The colouring of their coats makes them difficult to see against the snowy, rocky environment they live in. These cats are most active at dawn and dusk. Scientists call it a crepuscular activity pattern. 
According to a media report, only 8,000 snow leopards are believed to be left in the wild across the world and fewer than 400 of them are estimated to be living in Pakistan. In the Himalayas, snow leopards live in the high alpine areas, mostly above the tree line and up to 18,000 feet in elevation. 
Pakistan is among the 12 countries including China, Russia, Bhutan, Nepal, India and Mongolia where they are found.  
In the Gilgit-Baltistan region, Baltistan Wildlife Conservation and Development Organisation (BWCDO) is working with local village populations to help protect and conserve the snow leopard. The BWCDO pioneered livestock insurance schemes for villagers to compensate farmers against livestock losses resulting from attacks by snow leopards to ensure the apex predators and humans coexist in harmony. 
After more than two decades of hard work, the snow leopard population in the area is not only surviving but thriving.

2,Ex-husband confesses to killing US national: Rawalpindi police,Police have also arrested the suspect's father and servant on charges of aiding and abetting the murder.,"RAWALPINDI: A 29-year-old man has confessed to killing his former wife, an American national of Pakistani origin, and burying her body in Lakki Marwat, disclosed Rawalpindi City Police Officer (CPO) Sajid Kiani on Saturday.  
While addressing a press conference, the police chief said suspect Rizwan Habib Bangash had murdered his ex-wife Wajiha Farooq Swati, 47, after kidnapping her and shifted the corpse to Lakki Marwat where he buried it in a room of his servant’s house in the Peezo area. 
SSP (Investigations) Syed Ghazan­far Ali Shah and SP (Potohar Division) Rana Abdul Wahab were also present at the presser.  

Body disinterred in Lakki Marwat

Sharing motive for the murder, the CPO said it emerged that she had been demanding back her property worth millions of rupees, which she had transferred in the name of Rizwan before their divorce. The police chief told the media that the police had recovered the body from the house in Lakki Marwat on the basis of information provided by the killer himself. 
The police chief said the body was being shifted to Rawalpindi. “Since the man killed the woman in Rawalpindi, the body will be brought to District Headquarters Hospital for a post-mortem examination after which it will be handed over to her heirs for burial,” CPO Kiani said.  
The police also arrested the father and servant of the suspect on charges of aiding and abetting the murder. The CPO said police investigators visited several cities to collect evidence and grill suspects during the course of investigation. “Police used latest technology and human intelligence to solve the high-profile murder case,” he said.  
In all, four special investigation teams had been formed under the supervision of SSP (Investigations) Shah to solve the case, he said.  
Mr Kiani said the US embassy was also in contact with him. He urged the media to refrain from relying on ‘unverified’ information about the case as investigation was still under way. The police would soon arrest other suspects in the case, he claimed.  
“We will share all details with the media once the investigations are completed,” CPO Kiani said.  
Concrete floor
The body of the Pakistani American was exhumed from the Wargher locality of Darra Peezu town in Lakki Marwat district on Saturday.  
Shaheed Haibat Ali Khan police SHO Amir Khan said the body had been buried in a room of the house, owned by Sultan, son of Saeed. He said the house owner was the servant of the suspected killer.

3,"Dictators, their cronies have ruined Quaid’s vision: Bilawal",JI chief calls ruling elite hurdle in achieving objective of Pakistan’s creation,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has said that “dictatorial forces and their cronies” have ruined the vision of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah who wanted to get a separate homeland for the Muslims of the sub-continent where they could live peacefully in a society based on equality and tolerance.  
This was stated by the PPP chairman in a message on the occasion of 145th birth anniversary of the Father of the Nation released by the party’s media office here on Saturday.  
“The dictatorial forces always attempted to drag the country away from Quaid-i-Azam’s vision. However, the country’s democratic forces under the leadership of the PPP have foiled all such conspiracies through unforgettable struggle,” Mr Bhutto-Zardari said.  
Paying glowing tribute to Quaid-i-Azam for his services for the cause of the Muslims of the subcontinent, he said the people of Pakistan and the PPP would continue to fulfill his mission. He said it was founding chairman of the PPP Zulfikar Ali Bhutto who fulfilled the dream of Quaid-i-Azam by giving the nation the unanimously agreed constitution of 1973. Mr Bhutto also laid the foundation of a strong defence of the country by strengthening its economy and starting the nuclear programme, he added.  

JI chief calls ruling elite hurdle in achieving objective of Pakistan’s creation

Later, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said, former prime minister Benazir Bhutto took a number of steps to make Pakistan a welfare state in line with the Quaid’s vision. He said Ms Bhutto took steps for providing protection to the women, children and marginalised segments of the society.  
In his separate message on the occasion of Christmas, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said the PPP was the only party which considered Christians, Muslims and people belonging to other religious communities as equal citizens of Pakistan. He said under the 1973 Constitution, all citizens of Pakistan, irrespective of their religion, had equal rights.  
The PPP chief said Ms Bhutto and Asif Zardari had ensured representation of the minorities in the government and institutions, including the Senate, during the governments under them. He said the PPP government had declared August 11 as the national day of minorities. Felicitating the Christian community on Christmas, Mr Bhutto-Zardari asked them to pray for peace, harmony and prosperity of Pakistan.  
Meanwhile, Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) chief Sirajul Haq while addressing party workers here on Saturday regretted that the dream to transform Pakistan as per vision of the Quaid-i-Azam could not be materialised, adding that the feudal lords and ruling elite were the main hurdles in achieving the real objective of Pakistan’s creation.  
Mr Haq said the ruling elite of the country worked on western agenda and it was because of them that the country tore into two pieces in 1971. He said the political and religious leadership unfortunately had not learnt the lesson till date and they kept dividing the nation in the name of caste and creed and other prejudices.   
The PTI, Mr Haq said, had come to power by uttering slogans of “change” and “state of Madina” but it had failed to transform Pakistan into a welfare Islamic state.
