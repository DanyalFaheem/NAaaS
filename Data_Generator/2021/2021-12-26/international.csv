The James Webb Space Telescope, some three decades and billions of dollars in the making, left Earth enclosed in its Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou Space Centre in French Guiana.
“What an amazing day. It’s truly Christmas,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, head of scientific missions for Nasa, which together with the European and Canadian space agencies, ESA and ACS, built the telescope.
ESA chief Josef Aschbacher said he was  “very happy to say that we’ve delivered the spacecraft into orbit very precisely... that Ariane 5 performed extremely well”.
This was key, since placing the spacecraft in orbit helps economise on the fuel the telescope will need to reach its final destination and perform well after that. It is expected to take a month to reach its remote destination.
It is set to beam back new clues that will help scientists understand more about the origins of the Universe and Earth-like planets beyond our solar system.
Named after a former Nasa director, Webb follows in the footsteps of the legendary Hubble — but intends to show humans what the Universe looked like even closer to its birth nearly 14 billion years ago.
Speaking on social media, Webb project co-founder John Mather described the telescope’s unprecedented sensitivity.
“#JWST can see the heat signature of a bumblebee at the distance of the Moon,” he said.
All that power is needed to detect the weak glow emitted billions of years ago by the very first galaxies to exist and the first stars being formed. The telescope is unequalled in size and complexity.
Its mirror measures 6.5 metres (21 feet) in diameter — three times the size of the Hubble’s mirror — and is made of 18 hexagonal sections. It is so large that it had to be folded to fit into the rocket.
That manoeuvre was laser-guided with Nasa imposing strict isolation measures to limit any contact with the telescope’s mirrors from particles or even human breath.
Once the rockets have carried Webb 120 kilometres, the protective nose of the craft, called a  “fairing”, will be shed to lighten the load.
To protect the delicate instrument from changes in pressure at that stage, rocket-builder Arianespace installed a custom decompression system.
“Exceptional measures for an exceptional client,” said a European Space Agency official in Kourou on Thursday.
Crew on the ground were to know whether the first stage of the flight was successful about 27 minutes after launch.
Once it reaches its station, the challenge will be to fully deploy the mirror and a tennis-court-sized sun shield.
That intimidatingly complex process will take two weeks and must be flawless if Webb is to function correctly.
Its orbit will be much farther than Hubble, which has been 600 kilometres above the Earth since 1990.
The location of Webb’s orbit is called the Lagrange 2 point and was chosen in part because it will keep the Earth, the Sun and the Moon all on the same side of its sun shield. Webb is expected to officially enter service in June.

1,China reports highest number of Covid cases in four months,China is on high alert for new infections as it prepares to hold the Winter Olympics in February.,"BEIJING: China on Saturday reported its highest number of new coronavirus cases in four months as officials rushed to contain outbreaks in several regions, including Xi’an city where millions are still under lockdown.
China, where the coronavirus was first detected in late 2019, is on high alert for new infections as it prepares to hold the Winter Olympics in February in the capital Beijing.
Of the 140 new infections, 87 were locally transmitted, according to a statement by the National Health Commission, compared to 55 a day earlier.
Most were in Xi’an, in the northwestern province of Shaanxi, where 13 million residents have been under lockdown since Thursday.
On Christmas Eve the city reported its highest daily count in a year with 75 domestic cases, according to the local health bureau on Saturday.
While China has reduced cases to a minimum — thanks to a zero-Covid strategy of tight border restrictions, lengthy quarantines and targeted lockdowns — cases have been bubbling up in recent weeks.
Footage from state broadcaster CCTV Saturday showed long queues outside Xi’an testing centres as officials rushed to stamp out the latest flareup.
Under strict lockdown rules, since Thursday all households in Xi’an have only been permitted to send one member outside every two days to purchase necessities. Residents need special permission from their employer or local authorities to leave the city.
Xi’an has recorded 330 locally transmitted symptomatic cases since the first case was reported on December 9 2021, few compared to outbreaks elsewhere in the world.
But some 26 Xi’an government officials have been punished for lapses in virus prevention, China’s disciplinary body said on Friday.
Local authorities who are deemed to have failed at controlling the virus in their region are regularly sacked or reprimanded under Beijing’s strict zero-Covid approach.
Cases from Xi’an have so far spread to five other cities including Beijing, according to state media, fuelling fears about how quickly the virus can spread geographically across the vast country.
China has reported 100,871 symptomatic cases and fewer than 5,000 deaths since the virus first emerged in the city of Wuhan in late 2019.

2,Hong Kong police make record 1.3 tonne ketamine bust,"Three local men and a man of Indian nationality, aged between 32 and 47, have been arrested.","HONG KONG: A haul of ketamine worth over $100 million has been seized by Hong Kong officials, police said on Saturday.
The record-breaking 1.3 tonnes of the drug, valued at around HK$840 million ($108 million), is the largest bust of its kind in the city’s history.
Travel restrictions related to Covid-19 have forced smugglers to make risker bulk shipments instead of using drug mules travelling through airports, police said.
On Friday morning, officers intercepted the narcotics as they were being offloaded from a speedboat in the seaside Lei Yue Mun district.
“Drug trafficking syndicates would use fishing boats or oceangoing vessels to transport the drugs to the high seas near Hong Kong waters. Then they will arrange speedboats to smuggle the drugs to shore,” Chief Inspector Ip Sau-lan said at a press conference.
Three local men and a man of Indian nationality, aged between 32 and 47, were arrested and remain in custody.
Police said the investigation is ongoing and would not rule out further arrests.
Traffickers will likely continue to smuggle drugs in bulk if Hong Kong maintains its pandemic-related travel restrictions, police added.

3,Taliban govt scraps Afghan election commission,"“There is no need for these commissions to exist and operate,” Taliban govt spokesman says.","KABUL: The Taliban have dissolved Afghanistan’s election commission, a panel that supervised polls during the previous Western-backed administration, a spokesman for the Islamist government said on Saturday.
“There is no need for these commissions to exist and operate,” Taliban government spokesman Bilal Karimi said, referring to the Independent Election Commission (IEC) and the Independent Electoral Complaints Commission.
“If we ever feel a need, the Islamic Emirate will revive these commissions.”
The Taliban swept to power in August as a Western-backed government imploded in the final stages of a US military withdrawal.
Established in 2006, the IEC was mandated to administer and supervise all types of elections, including presidential, according to the commission’s website.
“They have taken this decision in a hurry... and dissolving the commission would have huge consequences,” Aurangzeb, who headed the panel up until the fall of the previous regime, said.
“If this structure does not exist, I’m 100 percent sure that Afghanistan’s problems will never be solved as there won’t be any elections,” said Aurangzeb, who like many Afghans goes by only one name.
Halim Fidai, a senior politician in the previous regime, said the decision to dissolve the electoral commission shows the Taliban  “do not believe in democracy”.
“They are against all democratic institutions. They get power through bullets and not ballots,” said Fidai, who was governor of four provinces over the past two decades.
Before the Taliban takeover, several electoral commission officials were killed by extremist groups.
Karimi said the authorities had also dissolved two government departments this week — the ministry of peace, and the ministry of parliamentary affairs.
The deeply conservative Taliban had already shut down the former administration’s ministry of women’s affairs and replaced it with the ministry for the promotion of virtue and prevention of vice.
That ministry earned notoriety during the Taliban’s first stint in power in the 1990s for harshly enforcing religious doctrine.
The Islamists are pressing the international community to restore billions of dollars in suspended aid and have pledged a more moderate rule this time around.

4,Armed intruder arrested in British queen’s castle grounds,"The 19-year-old from Southampton in southern England did not enter any buildings, police say.","LONDON: A man who entered the grounds of Windsor Castle, where Britain’s Queen Elizabeth is spending Christmas, has been arrested and is being held on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon, police said on Saturday.
The 19-year-old from Southampton in southern England did not enter any buildings and security processes were triggered within moments, Thames Valley Police said in a statement.
The 95-year-old monarch, who has spent much of the Covid-19 pandemic at Windsor Castle, was celebrating Christmas there with her son, Prince Charles, his wife, Camilla, and other close family.
“The man has been arrested on suspicion of breach or trespass of a protected site and possession of an offensive weapon,” said Thames Valley Police Superintendent Rebecca Mears.
She added that members of the royal family had been informed about the incident and that police did not believe there was a wider danger to the public. The incident took place at about 0830 GMT.
Charles, Camilla and other royal family members were pictured later in the morning arriving for a Christmas church service at St George’s Chapel within the Windsor Castle complex.
There was no suggestion that any of the royal family’s plans had been disrupted by the incident.

5,Tear gas fired at anti-coup rallies in Sudan,Protesters call for a transition to civilian rule.,"KHARTOUM: Thousands of Sudanese protesters rallied on Saturday two months after a military coup, demanding soldiers  “go back to the barracks” and calling for a transition to civilian rule.
Waving flags, beating drums, dancing and chanting, crowds marched on the streets of Khartoum despite a heavy deployment of security forces — who later fired tear gas to break them up.
Officers had earlier blocked bridges connecting the capital to suburbs, cut phone lines and restricted the internet ahead of the planned protests.
At least 48 people have died in crackdowns during weeks of demonstrations, according to the independent Doctors’ Committee, and Khartoum’s state governor has warned that security forces  “will deal with those who break the law and create chaos”.
Demonstrators converged on the presidential palace in Khartoum, the headquarters of the military government in control since General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan seized power on October 25.
Burhan held civilian leader Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok effectively under house arrest for weeks, but after international pressure reinstated him on November 21 under a deal promising elections for July 2023.
