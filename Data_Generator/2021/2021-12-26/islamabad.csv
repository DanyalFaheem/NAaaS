0,CDA issues two notices to Pak-EPA as differences over road project persist,"Civic agency says environment watchdog using research building as offices, encroaching plot.","ISLAMABAD: In a tit-for-tat move against Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (Pak-Epa)’s direction to stop work on Margalla Avenue, the Capital Development Authority (CDA) has issued two notices to the environment watchdog asking it to bring its building under conforming use and remove encroachment from an adjacent plot.
According to the EPA, Margalla Avenue was being constructed without an environment impact assessment (EIA). Besides, a portion of the road also passes through Margalla Hills National Park.
The CDA earlier termed the environment body’s order illegal, stating that the road was being constructed in accordance with Islamabad’s master plan of 1960 and under the CDA ordinance the agency can’t direct the civic agency to stop the work.
When both the organisations were at loggerhead, the civic agency issued the notices, pointing out that the EPA was an encroacher as it had occupied an adjacent plot of the CDA by constructing rooms and planting trees there.

Civic agency says environment watchdog using research building as offices, encroaching plot

One of the notices issued by the building control section said a building meant for research and training centre was being used as offices of the EPA.
The notice said a firefighting system had also not been installed in the building as per the CDA standards.
Meanwhile, another notice issued by the director land said: “Environment Research Training Centre under the administrative control of the Ministry of Climate Change is an encroachment on Plot No 41, Sector H-8/2.”
The plot was a public property and the encroachment would be removed under Section 4,5,6,7 and 8 of the Building Control Regulations 2020, the notice said, adding the encroachment was a serious violation of the Public Properties (Removal of Encroachment) Ordinance 2021.
“You are hereby issued a show-cause notice under Section 3 of the ordinance to remove the encroachment within seven days of the issuance of this notice. If you failed to remove the encroachment, the cost of demolition and removal of structure will be recovered from the unauthorised occupant of the structure under Section 6 of the ordinance,” the notice said.
On the other hand, CDA officials alleged that the EPA was creating hurdles in completion of the Margalla Road by raising unnecessary questions which did not fall in its jurisdiction.
When contacted, a senior officer of the EPA wishing not to be named said the agency’s notice to the CDA on Margalla Road construction was justified and in accordance with rules and regulations. The officer said the CDA can’t construct a road without an EIA.
About the notices issued by the CDA, the officer said EPA would respond to them.
“We have not committed any violation. The research and training centre requires offices and we set up offices in accordance with rules and regulations,” the officer said. “As far as encroachment on the adjacent plot is concerned, we did not encroach on it rather have planted trees there. Some structure like a room was already constructed there by a contractor,” the officer said.

5,Putin’s stance on sanctity of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) welcomed,Religious scholars from across the country thank the Russian president for understanding the sentiments of Muslims.,"ISLAMABAD: Religious scholars from all over the country have lauded Russian President Vladimir Putin’s stance on ‘Namoos-i-Risalat’ [respecting the sanctity of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)] and thanked him for understanding the sentiments of the Muslims.
In a joint statement, the religious scholars said the stand taken by Prime Minister Imran Khan before the world on Namoos-i-Risalat and Islamophobia had become a success following President Putin’s stance.
The statement has been issued from the platform of the Pakistan Ulema Council that said the time was near when the United Nations would pass a resolution to condemn blasphemy on Namoos-i-Mustafa, prophets and Islamophobia.
Meanwhile, leader of Shia Ulema Council (SUC) Allama Sajid Naqvi, in a separate statement, said it was a welcoming sign that the western notion of freedom of expression was being scrutinised.
“There was always a need to distinguish between freedom of expression and hurling insults at highly respectable personalities,” Allama Naqvi said.
He, however, added that academic discussion too should be differentiated between research work and making mockery of elders. “We all believe in freedom of expression but there has to be a limit,” he said. He also congratulated the Christian community on the occasion of Christmas.
“We need to follow the commandments of Hazrat Esa who preached peace, brotherhood and unity to the world,” the SUC chief said, adding that “it is also a known fact that Quaid-i-Azam wanted to make Pakistan a truly Islamic welfare democratic state, which granted equal rights to all its residents belonging to various religions and faiths”.

RAWALPINDI: Christmas was celebrated in twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad amid tight security.
The churches were decorated with colourful lights to give the occasion a touch of joyousness. All the churches organised midnight services where prayers were offered followed by morning services.
Last year, no major gathering was held in the churches due to Covid-19.
Though this year threat of omicron variant loomed large, the church administrations made special arrangements to follow the Covid-19 standard operating procedures (SOPs).
“We could not arrange a big gathering last year but thank God have come back to the church to celebrate Christmas this year. We also arranged a party at home where my brothers and sisters and children enjoyed the occasion,” said George Masih, a resident of a locality near Holy Family Hospital, Rawalpindi.
The biggest gathering was held at St Joseph’s Cathedral. Big congregations were also held in other churches where religious prayers were offered. The community members prayed for the prevalence of peace and establishment of brotherhood and fraternity in the world.
Christmas trees and cribs were decorated in the houses of the Christian community. Even the Christian community members living in slums celebrated the event with religious zeal.
Special security arrangements were made in and around the churches so the community performed their religious rituals without any hurdles.

An event, Urdu Aur Quaid-i-Azam, was organised at the NLPD with eminent Quaid-i-Azam scholar Dr Riaz Ahmad in the chair.
Speaking on the occasion, Dr Ahmad said Quaid-i-Azam had said Urdu would become the official language of Pakistan. When the language of a nation is given official status, the institution related to it must be strengthened, he added.
The director general of the organisation, Dr Rauf Parekh, said Quaid-i-Azam felt that a national language was necessary for the unity and solidarity of Pakistan. Urdu alone is the national language which is spoken and understood across the country.
“Quaid knew that if the national language status was given to another language along with Urdu, issues would arise with regard to other languages. Time proved that Quaid’s decision was correct,” he said.
Prof Dr Ghazi Ilmuddin said in view of the Urdu-Hindi controversy at the time of the establishment of Pakistan, the Quaid was aware of the fact that Urdu was not only the name of a language but also a symbolic representation of a culture. Only Urdu is capable of safeguarding the rich literary heritage and cultural traditions.
Dr Muzammil Hussain said Quaid’s leadership qualities not only brought Pakistan into existence but also dealt with the emerging problem of the national language.
Kaukab Iqbal Advocate said Quaid proclaimed the establishment of a welfare state in which he clearly pronounced Urdu as its national language.
Meanwhile, PRCS arranged a ceremony in connection with its 74th foundation day and the birth anniversary of the Quaid at its headquarters.
National Assembly Deputy Speaker Qasim Suri, PRCS Chairman Abrarul Haq and others were among the participants.
Speaking on the occasion, Mr Suri said Red Crescent had made a name for itself by giving priority to the service of humanity.
“I congratulate PRCS on its 74 years of success in humanitarian services and hope that the society will continue its journey with out most commitment and dedication,” he added.
The PRCS chairman said since its inception on December 20, 1947, the society had been serving humanity by adhering to the seven basic principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, voluntary service, unity and universality. He said during tragedies and disasters whether manmade or natural, PRCS acted on the principle of first to reach and last to leave.
He said during the pandemic, the society remained instrumental in providing hospital care, vaccination, blood donations, cash assistance, rations, personal protection kits, hygiene kits, hand washing stations and sanitizer machines.
A family gala was also arranged at the end of the ceremony.

He said this during his visit to the graveyard along with union council chairmen of PML-N. Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation (RMC) officials gave them a briefing about the work.
All graves would be constructed as per numbers and funeral area should provide all facilities for ablution and prayers, he said, adding in the tenure of PML-N, former chief minister Shehbaz Sharif established Sher-i-Khamoshan to improve the condition of graveyards in the province but the present government stopped the work.
He said in 1997, the government allocated 1,000 kanals of land for the graveyard as there was shortage of space in the existing one, adding, some work was done during 2013-2018 but work was initiated using RMC funds.
There was an encroachment problem in all graveyards of the city thus no one will be allowed to do this in Rakh Dhamial as this land will be protected from land grabbers at any cost, Mr Naseem said.
On the other hand, officials of the administration said that people were not interested to bury their near and dear ones in Rakh Dhamialas it was out of the city. There is no proper transport to carry the dead body and people to attend funeral prayers. However, the mayor said that three funeral buses would be provided to people.
Meanwhile, Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) which is responsible for metropolitan planning of the city and manage housing societies across the district failed to force private housing societies to develop their own graveyards.
Under the law, it is mandatory for space to be provided for a graveyard, school, college, mosque, park and roads and this must be transferred in the name of the state.

15,Action against adulterated milk sellers lauded,MUZAFFARABAD: Civil society in the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) capital has heaped praise on the civic authorities...,"MUZAFFARABAD: Civil society in the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) capital has heaped praise on the civic authorities for taking the much needed action shortly after a go-ahead from the region’s apex court against dairy outlets selling adulterated milk since long.
Early this month, during the hearing of a petition filed by Shahid Zaman Awan, a civil society activist heading a consumer rights group, the AJK Supreme Court had given one month to the Municipal Corporation Muzaffarabad (MCM) to take action against shops selling adulterated milk.
Some of the shops were selling milk that would be brought in tanks from outside the AJK territory.
After the apex court order, MCM magistrate Sardar Imran had collected samples from 10 suspicious dairy shops in different city neighbourhoods.
The samples were dispatched to Pakistan Council of Scientific and Industrial Research Complex Lahore for examination and the report received through courier service on Thursday established that the milk was unsafe for human health.
The envelope carrying the report was opened by deputy commissioner Nadeem Ahmed Janjua, who also holds the additional charge of administrator MCM, in the presence of civil society activists, following which all shops were sealed by the magistrate and other officials concerned on his instructions.
One of the sealed shops was reportedly run by Prime Minister Abdul Qayyum Niazi’s brother.
The move, publicised on social media for the information of the general public, drew wide appreciation from the residents.
“Thank God, they [authorities] took the much-needed action. We salute them for exposing these shops which were selling poison in the name of milk,” said Raja Shakil, a resident of Madina Market who regularly sensitises both the citizens and the official machinery on issues of public interest.
“A very good step indeed for which both the judiciary and civic authorities deserve our appreciation. But we look forward to consistency because people involved in the synthetic milk trade are well connected,” said Faiza Gillani, another civil society activist.
Netizens demanded severe punishment to what they called unscrupulous elements involved in the illicit trade.
However, in response to a question, MCM chief officer Anjum Bilal told Dawn that no arrest had been made because people found at the [sealed] shops were employees and not the owners.
“We are mulling over strict penalties to prevent people from doing such an illicit business,” he said.
