ISLAMABAD: Amidst calls for urgent help for Afghanistan that is faced with a dire humanitarian situation, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) on Sunday set up a Humanitarian Trust Fund and Food Security Programme for dealing with the rapidly aggravating crisis. 
The 57-member Muslim bloc, which is also the world’s second-largest multilateral forum, in a communiqué adopted at the end of the extraordinary session of its Council of Foreign Ministers said it “will play a leading role in the delivery of humanitarian and development aid to the people of Afghanistan”. 
The foreign ministers’ meeting had been convened to discuss and prepare a strategy for dealing with the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan, whose more than half of the population, nearly 22.8 million people, was faced with an acute food shortage. It is estimated by the UN agencies that 3.2m children were at the risk of acute malnutrition. 
The OIC would set up Humanitarian Trust Fund and Food Security Programme, besides appointing the body’s Assistant Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs Ambassador Tarig Ali Bakheet as special envoy of the OIC secretary general for Afghanistan, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi announced at a media conference at the end of the conference along with OIC Secretary General Hissein Brahim Taha. 
Ahead of the meeting there were expectations that the participants of the forum would make pledges and agree on a financial vehicle for channeling assistance to Afghanistan that has been disconnected from the international financial system following the Taliban takeover because of sanctions against the new regime and collapse of the banking system. The absence of financial channels was making it difficult for donors to send relief money to Afghanistan. 
Other than Foreign Minister of Saudi Arabia Faisal bin Farhan saying the kingdom would provide one billion Saudi riyals ($265 million) in assistance to Afghanistan and Mr Qureshi recalling that Pakistan had committed $30m for helping the Afghans, there were hardly any other pledges. 
The Fund to be managed by the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) would be made operational by March next year. It would function in collaboration with other international actors. 
Foreign Minister Qureshi said the Fund would act as a channel for delivering humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan. 
The OIC member states, Islamic financial institutions, donors and other international partners were urged in the communiqué to announce pledges to the Fund. 
The OIC Secretariat, IDB and Fund officials would, moreover, negotiate with the UN bodies for unlocking the financial and banking channels so that aid could be disbursed among the people of Afghanistan. 
The OIC foreign ministers called for unfreezing of Afghanistan’s financial resources by the United States for preventing collapse of the economic system and revival of the economic activity. 
Ambassador Bakheet has been mandated to coordinate relief efforts, besides pursuing economic and political engagement with Afghanistan. He would be assisted in his role by the OIC mission in Kabul, which is also being strengthened through provision of additional human, financial and logistical resources. 
The Food Security Programme would, meanwhile, be established by Islamic Organisation for Food Security using its own food security reserves. OIC member states, international donors, UN funds and programmes and other international actors were asked to contribute to the food programme. 
At the inaugural session, Prime Minister Imran Khan warned of impending “chaos” in Afghanistan. He said instability in Afghanistan would not be in anyone’s interest as it could lead to refugee exodus from the war-ravaged country and heightened terrorism threat particularly from the militant Islamic State group. 
Mr Khan said it was OIC members’ religious duty to help Afghanistan, adding that failing to extend a helping hand to the Afghans could result in “the biggest man-made crisis”. He also asked Washington to be mindful of the plight to 40m Afghans instead of blocking the funds because of Taliban rule. 
Referring to the world’s conditions for engagement with the Taliban, the prime minister urged the international community to be “sensitive” to Afghan culture and values while asking the new regime to deliver on human rights and women rights. He pointed out that Afghanistan is culturally different from others for being a conservative society. 
Foreign Minister Qureshi proposed a “six-point framework” for the OIC to deal with the crisis. The proposal included creation of a financial vehicle for channeling aid, increasing investment in people of Afghanistan, facilitating Afghanistan’s access to legitimate banking services and easing the liquidity challenge there, enhancing food security, building capacity of Afghan institutions in countering terrorism and combating illicit trade in narcotics, and engaging with the Taliban on world’s expectations. 
OIC Secretary General Hissein Brahim Taha called on all stakeholders in Afghanistan to cooperate with the OIC mission in Kabul to provide relief to the affected Afghan people. “The OIC is ready to carry out a follow-up of the outcome and to play its role in supporting humanitarian action in coordination with the relevant OIC missions and relief agencies across the Muslim world,” he said. 
UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Martin Griffiths, who was representing Secretary General António Guterres at the conference, underscored the gravity of the situation, saying Afghanistan’s economy was in “free fall”. He said that if the international community failed to act “decisively and with compassion”, Afghanistan’s entire population could be “pulled down” into poverty and misery. 
The UN official asked the international community to give more than just humanitarian assistance. Donor funding, he said, should cover salaries for public sector workers and support basic services such as health, education, electricity and livelihoods. He also urged “constructive engagement” with Taliban authorities as the “de facto” government over the world’s expectations from them. 
The UN official warned that failure to help Afghanistan risks the collapse of the country. 
Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, speaking at the plenary session, reassured the international community of Taliban’s commitment to human rights, women rights and forming an inclusive government as their “duty”. 
The Taliban delegation attended the meeting as observer for lacking international recognition, while Afghanistan’s seat at the conference remained vacant.

1,"Owner, builder of illegal structure booked after Karachi blast",KARACHI: The Shershah drain blast death toll rose to 17 on Sunday when rescue workers retrieved two more bodies from...,"KARACHI: The Shershah drain blast death toll rose to 17 on Sunday when rescue workers retrieved two more bodies from under the rubble, while police booked for murder the building owner and those responsible for covering the drain with concrete to raise the illegal structure that had collapsed a day ago.  
According to officials, the deceased spotted in the early hours of Sunday were identified as Sardar, cashier of the bank branch whose floor caved in, and Mohammad Ali. 
The explosion, which was caused by accumulation of gases in the underground sewer, left nearly three dozen men including bank employees and customers buried under the debris in the drain where heavy machinery was employed to rescue survivors and retrieve bodies. 
One of the deceased was father of a ruling party lawmaker, Dilawar Khan, who owned a nearby showroom. In all, 11 lives were saved by rescue organizations and doctors. 
An area police officer said the Site-B police registered an FIR (449/2021) against the suspects responsible for the construction of the building and its owner under host of charges, including manslaughter, on behalf of the state.
The police officer, Asghar, said two bodies were recovered on Sunday at around 1:30am from under the debris. With this addition, the death toll rose to 17, he added.
He explained that the debris along with people on the floor had fallen into the drain due to the explosion.
According to the FIR, the blast took place at around 1:45pm on Saturday ‘near’ Habib Bank Ltd, adjacent to PSO petrol pump, located on Estate Avenue Road, Site, at Shershah Chowk. Contingents of the police rushed to the spot and saw the debris of the bank floor, walls and an office behind the bank in the drain. 
The police called the bomb disposal squad and crime scene unit, Edhi and Chhipa and other rescue teams, which removed the debris with the help of machinery and shifted the dead and the injured to Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi.
Led by Inspector Mohammed Amir, the bomb disposal squad examined the place, collected samples and submitted their report to the complainant, said SHO Inspector Zawar Husain. “The BDS team in their report stated that the blast occurred due to exiting of gases from sewerage line beneath the building housing the bank and another office,” the FIR mentioned. “This report [of bomb experts] and examination of the place showed that the bank and other office were constructed on sewerage line illegally and continuous exiting of gases from the nullah (drain) caused this incident.”
The building was constructed by encroaching on the sewerage nullah. Therefore, the ‘responsible persons involved in the construction and the owner of the building’ have committed crimes under Sections 322 (qatl-bis-sabab), 337-H (causing hurt by rash or negligent act), 337-I (causing hurt by mistake), 427 (mischief causing damage) and 34 (common intention) of Pakistan Penal Code.
Probe
Investigators in the meantime collected samples of debris, battery part, dust, colour, electric wire piece, sewage water, wood piece, CCTV DVR as evidences. Further footage was being obtained. The collected evidences would be sent to a lab for forensic analysis to confirm reason of the explosion.
DIG South Sharjeel Kharal said a total of 17 men died and 11 persons were injured. He elaborated that 13 employees of the bank were posted at the branch though half of the staff was on duty on Saturday when the blast took place. Five of them along with two customers who were in the branch died, whereas 10 of the deceased were outside the bank, the officer said. 
The explosion also affected the adjacent shops and showroom run by MNA Alamgir Khan’s father who also died, said the senior officer.
When asked about the reports of another explosion, DIG Kharal said it was caused by a short circuit soon after the major explosion, but it did not cause any injury to human being. After the second minor explosion due to short circuit, the police called K-Electric teams and got the power supply disconnected to prevent any untoward incident during debris removal.

2,SBP tightens rules on buying foreign currency,Measures taken to improve “documentation and transparency and to further strengthen the foreign exchange regulatory regime”.,"KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has amended its regulations regarding purchase of foreign currency, binding all exchange companies to ensure that no individual shall buy foreign exchange of more than $10,000 per day and $100,000 per calendar year (or equivalent in other currencies) in the form of cash or outward remittances.
According to a circular issued on Sunday, the amendments have been introduced to improve “documentation and transparency and to further strengthen the foreign exchange regulatory regime” for both mainstream and small (category B) exchange companies.
The amendments have been made to instructions contained in para 9 of chapter 3 and para 12 of chapter 8 of the Exchange Com­panies’ Manual, which sets out the scope of business of exchange companies.
Under these amendments, all exchange companies must ensure that any individual shall not purchase foreign exchange of more than $10,000 per day and $100,000 per calendar year (or equivalent in other currencies) in the form of cash or outward remittances.
The SBP said these limits had been set considering the individual’s personal needs for foreign exchange.
However, a person can still send educational and medical expenses abroad worth up to $70,000 per calendar year and $50,000 per invoice from banks as per existing regulations.
If a person wants to send an amount exceeding these limits, they can approach the Foreign Exchange Operations Department of the SBP Banking Services Corporation through their bank.
In addition, the exchange companies shall now obtain supporting documents against the sale of foreign exchange exceeding $1,000 (or equivalent in other currencies) substantiating the purpose of the transaction. Besides, they must not perform transactions against authority letters.
The SBP circular further emphasised that the exchange companies “shall perform transactions only at authorised outlets of the company and shall not provide delivery services to the customers”.
There is no change in regulations with respect to foreign currency accounts of individuals.

3,Govt may rethink energy subsidy policy as misuse surfaces,APTMA seeks PM’s help to stop energy ministry from curtailing supplies.,"ISLAMABAD: Amid major gas supply constraints, the government may have to rethink its energy subsidy priorities after coughing up over Rs80 billion per annum in handouts to the export industry in the last over three years as it found little connection between subsidies and export growth, with the textile industry even reneging on its side of the pledge.
A senior government official told Dawn that the Ministry of Energy had received an independent study from three international reputed organisations — The University of Chicago, The London School of Economics and Political Science and International Growth Centre — which did not comprehensively support a narrative in the country that gas and electricity subsidies had direct link to export growth.
The ministries of energy, finance and planning are convinced about rent-seeking and misuse in the textile sector, he said.

APTMA seeks PM’s help to stop energy ministry from curtailing supplies

Also, the Ministry of Energy feels aggrieved by the textile industry’s attempts to protect gas supplies and subsidies through courts instead of honouring its commitments to spare gas quantities being used in captive power plants (CPPs) while gas companies struggled to manage supplies for other priority sectors.
“They got stay orders against efficiency tests and minor adjustments in subsidised tariffs. They cannot have best of two worlds by squeezing the state,” the official said.
This is on top of other subsidies and facilitations like DTRE, TERF and DLTL schemes as well as tax exemptions.
On the other hand, the influential All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (APTMA) is seeking urgent intervention of the prime minister to block the energy ministry and related cabinet committees from additional steps including disruption in gas supplies.
The Ministry of Energy has been advised by some experts to get more specific studies done on urgent basis to conclude whether the return in the shape of export on each dollar of subsidy paid to the textile sector was justified. The ministry believed that the major part of their production went into the domestic market.
This was based on the study conducted by the above international institutions while examining the entire value chain of five export-oriented sectors between 2014 and 2020.
The study concluded that preferential tariffs had “limited effects on exports” and while partial evidence suggested gas subsidy increased the overall exports by 6pc, statistical evidence was weak. This highlighted the need for specific study for impact on textile export and the cost benefit analysis.
On the other hand, the study, however, confirmed larger increases in domestic sales for both gas and electricity subsidy.
It observed that subsidies had “smaller overall effects with much less statistical significance” and in overall terms concluded that “preferential tariffs are not a game changer.
“There may be positive effects, but the sensitivity of results suggests they do not lead to transformative changes”, the study observed.
It also noted that largest firms in the export sector were receiving subsidies and, perhaps because of political reasons, other eligible firms were not getting such subsidy.
The government has been providing subsidised gas and power at $6.5 per MMBTU and nine cents per kwh, respectively, for three years, but now finds it unsustainable and untargeted.
It estimates the cost of annual gas subsidy at Rs65bn and Rs20bn on power subsidy – leading to circular debt build up.
Official sources said about 1,870 export industries were currently getting uninterrupted gas on SNGPL network (mostly Punjab) while about 420 factories were on SSGCL network (mostly in Sindh). Because of gas crunch, about 375 factories with captive power plants had been disconnected because they were running their captive power plants (mostly inefficient) at subsidised gas while gas for their processes was still intact.  
The official said the subsidy was originally meant for one year to revive the export sector but was later extended for another year till June 2020 because of Covid-19 challenges. The textile mills had agreed to end gas subsidy on June 30, 2020.
The energy ministry is now pushing for targeted subsidy to exporters based on export proceeds. Specifically for textile exports, it wants gas supply only for cloth-making and complete ban on gas consumption by CPPs as both the process and captive power plants have separate meters. The ministry believes that power supply at nine cents per unit was regionally competitive and a ban on gas to captive power would shift these mills to use power from the national grid.
On the other hand, the APTMA, in a letter to Prime Minister Imran Khan, sought an urgent meeting.
It said the energy minister had assured the Punjab export sector of continued gas supply provided they agreed to increase the price to $9MMBTU from $6.5.
“APTMA agreed to this in the presence of Abdul Razak Dawood” but subsequently presented a Gas Management Plan to the CCOE on Dec 2, 2021 under which gas to CPPs, whether co-generation or not, would be load shed from Dec 15,” the letter said.
“The Punjab-based industry was thereof hit with a double whammy — increase in gas price at $9, double that of Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and load shedding from Dec 15. Under these circumstances, some member mills went to court on Dec 8 — full six days after the CCOE — and got stay on the basis of discrimination vs other provinces”.
Claiming that 70pc of the textile industry was Punjab based and suspension of gas will bring 80pc of the industry to a complete halt, the APTMA said it would have “an extremely negative impact on exports and will bring to an end the extremely positive increase in exports and investment witnessed during the last year”, adding that if the industry was “unable to deliver goods on order, orders once lost will be a permanent loss to Pakistan, and extremely difficult if not impossible to reverse”, resulting in negative impact on employment and investments.

4,KP local govt polls seem swinging away from PTI,"Unofficial, initial results show JUI-F leading on Peshawar mayor seat, other fronts.","• Unofficial, initial results show JUI-F leading on Peshawar mayor seat, other fronts
• ECP postpones polls in some areas after violence
• Bajaur suicide blast kills ANP workers; anti-merger mob attacks minister’s vehicle in Kohat; Karak clash leaves two dead    
PESHAWAR: In the first local government elections since the merger of tribal districts with Khyber Pakhtun­khwa, the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) appeared to be losing ground as Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) was leading on many fronts, including the one for the coveted post of Peshawar mayor, unofficial, initial results of the 17 district polls showed in the early hours of Monday morning. 
The first phase of local government polls, marked by scattered incidents of violence and attacks that claimed five lives and destroyed some polling stations, was held on Sunday after a gap of six years. 
With the unofficial results of mayor/chairman of the 63 tehsil councils being in early stages, JUI-F candidates were ahead of their rivals as the PTI faced setbacks in parts of the province, where the Awami National Party (ANP) and Jamaat-i-Islami seemed to have regained strength. In Peshawar, according to initial, unofficial results, JUI-F candidates were leading in three of the seven councils, whereas the PTI and the ANP were ahead in two tehsils each. 
The Election Commission of Pakistan, which set up 9,223 polling stations for 12.668 million registered voters, had to postpone the vote in some areas of the 17 districts due to disturbances, including a suicide blast in Bajaur, abduction of polling staff in Bannu, a clash in Karak and a mob attack on Minister Shibli Faraz’s vehicle in Kohat. However, owing to the decision of the ECP to hold the local government elections in two phases, overall arrangements were better than what had been witnessed during the 2015 polls. 
In Swabi, the PTI faced a setback as provincial minister Shahram Tarakai’s uncle Baland Iqbal lost to ANP candidate Ghulam Haqqani in Razar Tehsil. JUI-F and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz were leading in Tehsil Topi and Lahor whereas results of Swabi tehsil were delayed for unknown reasons. The JUI-F was also leading in two of the three tehsils of Charsadda district. In Mardan, ANP’s candidate was far ahead of his rivals for the mayor seat, while JUI-F was leading in Katlang and Takhbai tehsils. Results from Garhi Kapura and Rustam tehsils of Mardan were awaited. 
In Nowshera, the native town of Defence Minister Pervez Khattak, his son Ishaq Khattak, was leading in one tehsil and ANP’s candidates were ahead in two other tehsils. In Haripur, PML-N candidates were ahead of their rivals in Khanpur and Ghazi tehsils whereas an independent candidate was leading in Haripur tehsil.
In Khyber, the newly formed Tehreek-i-Islahat Pakistan party was leading in Landi Kotal and Jamrud tehsil, while JUI-F was ahead of its rivals in tehsil Bara. In Bajaur, JUI-F and JI were leading in Khar and Nawagai tehsils, respectively. Also, the JUI-F was leading in Upper Mohmand and Khaweezai tehsils whereas ANP was in the lead in the lower Mohmand tehsil. In Bannu, two tehsils were dominated by the PTI whereas JUI-F and an independent candidate were leading in each of the other two tehsil councils. In Dera Ismail Khan, PTI, JI, JUI-F and PPP candidates were leading one seat each in four tehsils, while an independent was ahead on the fifth tehsil. In Lakki Marwat, independent candidates were leading in two tehsils whereas the JI candidate was ahead in the third tehsil.
According to the ECP, a total of 2,032 candidates had already been elected unopposed on VCNC seats, including 217 general councillors, 876 women, 285 peasants, 500 youth and 154 minority seats, in the 17 districts of KP. 
In all, 12.668 million voters — seven million male and five and a half million female — were registered for the polls in the 17 KP districts namely Buner, Bajaur, Swabi, Peshawar, Nowshera, Kohat, Karak, Dera Ismail Khan, Bannu, Tank, Haripur, Khyber, Mohmand, Mardan, Charsadda, Hangu and Lakki Marwat. Of the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas, local government elections were held for the first time in Khyber, Mohmand and Bajaur districts. 
In Bajaur’s Mamund tehsil, a suicide attack on a vehicle taking voters to a polling station left two ANP workers dead and five others wounded, District Police Officer Abdul Samad Khan said. The suicide bomber blew himself up near the vehicle in the Kamar Sar locality on Inayat Killey-Laghari road, close to the Afghan border, at around 12.40pm, the officer said. 
In Kohat, federal Minister for Science and Information Technology Shibli Faraz who had arrived in Darra Adamkhel area to cast his vote came under attack during a protest against the merger of tribal areas with KP. The mob pelted the official vehicle of the minister with stones, injuring the driver, police said. The unruly mob also burned down polling stations in Jammu, Paya Jawaki, Shindhand and Ara Khel areas. 
Holding black flags, the protesters raised slogans against the merger demanding restoration of previous status of the tribal areas.  
While condemning the attack on the minister vehicle, Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed ordered the KP chief secretary and the IGP to submit a report. 
Also, the ECP postponed elections in Bakakhel tehsil of Bannu district, where unidentified men on the eve of polls abducted staff of five polling stations along with election material. A senior administration official told Dawn the ECP postponed the polling though the authorities managed to recover the abducted staff. The official said an FIR was registered and a three-member committee was formed to probe the incident and submit its report within a week. 
In Faqirkhel area of Karak’s Takht Nasrti tehsil, poll-related violence left two people, cousins of PTI MNA Shahid Khattak, dead and three others critically wounded, officials said. 
In Khyber district, polling was suspended in the remote Bazaar-Zakhakhel locality after a rocket exploded near a polling station. While no casualty was reported, local sources said, volunteers of the Bazaar-Zakhakhel peace committee using the incident as an excuse disrupted the polling by taking polling staff hostage for some time and destroying election material. They, however, later blamed one of the non-local candidates and his supporters responsible for the episode. 
Anwarullah Khan in Bajaur, Abdul Sami Paracha in Kohat and Ibrahim Shinwari in Landi Kotal also contributed to this report.
