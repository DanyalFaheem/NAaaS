0,‘Egalitarian’ crime: cut above the rest?,"Is crime in katcha areas, or in Karachi, or Faisalabad, more tolerable than that in the leafy green lanes of Islamabad?","NO doubt, Pakistan is far from alone in that each reported atrocity is rapidly and of necessity replaced in the headlines by a newer act of anarchy. Yet, this country seems to do such a particularly good job of it.
The appalling crime in Sialkot is of a proportion that all the attention and aversion it has garnered, be it from local residents, non-resident Pakistanis, government, opposition, and ulema circles, cannot be enough. 
Why this atrocity has in particular hit such a very raw nerve, though, is difficult to quantify: it was also in Sialkot in 2010, for example, that brothers Mughees and Muneeb Butt were lynched — killed, strung up, their bodies mutilated; in 2014, Shama and Shahzad Masih from Kot Radha Kishan (just 60km from Lahore) were beaten to near-death and then thrown alive into a brick kiln to reach a terrifying fate; the horrors are too numerous to recount here, and there’s little point since we remember them all anyway.
Beyond these terrible tragedies that must of necessity stand out, the running and consistent reportage of, shall we say, more run-of-the-mill crimes tends to get eclipsed. But where the particularly horrifying crimes betray patterns, so do the others: the cell-phone snatchings, the vehicle-liftings, the armed robberies in residences and commercial concerns, the murders over ‘personal enmities’, all of which continue to be reported from across the country with mind-numbing regularity. Taken together, this latter category betrays a trend where increasingly, crime in Pakistan is at least egalitarian — no one is insulated or safe.
This last was demonstrated by a couple of pieces of news in recent days from our capital, the so-called ‘Safe City’ — tidy, leafy, criss-crossed all over by cameras, equipped with law enforcement with picture-perfect vehicles and uniforms.
But an armed robbery in Islamabad’s well-protected sector of F-7/3 — almost exactly opposite the house of the inspector general of police — caused something of a stir in this city of the most privileged (as a generalisation) of Pakistanis. The daylight raid on the house of a businessman, Yasir Ansari, netted the four armed intruders over Rs9.5m, foreign currency, and gold. 
It is an illustration of how the siege mentality increasingly being reported amongst Pakistan’s millions can work against them. Outside the IGP’s house are always a couple of police dalaas, and round-the-clock police guards. But once the black Toyota Corolla carrying the robbers had gained ingress into Mr Ansari’s premises, and the gates shut behind it, who on the street outside could possibly suspect what in fact was under way behind those same high walls that had been meant to protect the homeowners?
(Also, given how this particular vehicle, particularly when occupied by large, neat, hard-looking men in white shalwar kameez and black waistcoats, especially in the heavily surveilled Islamabad, has become inextricably associated with shadowy agencies and their spooks, what poor footpath-pounding policeman would ever dare flag it down? Such is the link between this vehicle and its ability to get through check posts that, reportedly, there is extra ‘on’ money for ordering it in black.)
Back to the point, however. A few days earlier, a similar daylight robbery had been carried out at the F-10 house of Senator Nuzhat Sadiq. On Nov 23, the Senate Standing Committee on Interior met at Parliament House. 
Taking up the issue of growing crime in the capital, the committee was provided data showing that in 2018, a total of 9,465 cases of crime were registered in Islamabad, followed by 9,748 in 2019 and 10,539 last year. Pressed for details, the SSP Investigation said that so far this year, in this city, 130 murder, 954 robbery, 585 theft, and 47 rape cases had been reported.
‘Had been reported.’ Here lies the rub. DIG Afzal Ahmed Kauser told the Senate committee that the police were now registering FIRs of “almost all” applicants, which is why an upward trend was in evidence. That begs the question, why were FIRs concerning any and all complaints of crime not already being registered? 
Isn’t any crime a transgression against the law, and must it not be given equal attention? Or is there much to read into the fact that with reference to the raid at Mr Ansari’s residence, police officials contacted by the press were hesitant of saying much since, they said, the incident was an embarrassment for the capital police. 
It is no secret, after all, that many crimes never get taken at all to the gates of the police since the victims have little faith in the law enforcers and even lower expectations of justice; and, even when reported, the police are often reluctant to file an FIR because the audit of unresolved cases on the books casts the force in a poor light.
At the Nov 23 Senate Standing Committee meeting, referring to the robbery of Senator Sadiq’s F-10 house, Senator Saifullah Abro observed: “This is not a katcha area, rather, the federal capital.”
That says a lot about the sense of security that Islamabadis have enjoyed for so long. Insulated from the frightening realities of rising crime that the rest of the country has for so long contended with, the capital appears to finally be waking up to that fact that it cannot forever cushion itself from the hardships faced by 200 million people — and, indeed, why should it be so privileged in a country where unemployment, a disaffected youth, the number of firearms on the streets, and an increasing distance between have and have-nots, are rising rapidly?
Is crime in katcha areas, or in Karachi, or Faisalabad, more tolerable than that in the leafy green lanes of Islamabad?

1,Thousands in Brussels protest against renewed Covid-19 curbs,"Only 13 arrests were made for rebellion and possession of prohibited articles, according to police spokesperson.","BRUSSELS: Belgian police intervened to disperse stone-throwing youths on Sunday after the latest protest march in Brussels against anti-coronavirus measures. 
The crowd that marched from the Gare du Nord railway station to a park in the city’s European quarter was smaller than in two previous protests, around 3,500 people, according to the police. 
But a smaller number of mainly young, black-clad and hooded protesters clashed with riot officers protecting the route to EU headquarters, where officials were meeting African leaders. Belgium is recording around 10,000 new Covid cases per day as the Omicron variant spreads in Europe, and authorities have again begun to tighten public health rules. 
Prime Minister Alexander De Croo’s government will meet on Wednesday to decide on any new measures, and the neighbouring Netherlands has already ordered a Christmas lockdown. Belgium has run a relatively successful vaccine campaign and has begun issuing booster shots, but a vocal minority is wary of compulsory jabs and certificates or opposes lockdown measures. 
The stone- and bottle-throwers were dispersed back into the Jubilee Park by charges by riot police, and officers in plain clothes made several arrests, a journalist saw. 
Some people who took part in the march carried placards reading “Free Zone”, “I’ve had my fair dose”, and “Enough is enough” were protesting the government’s strong advice to get vaccinated. 
They included Belgian health care workers who will have a three-month window in which to get vaccinated against the virus beginning Jan 1 or risk losing their jobs. 
A strong police presence and widespread preventive controls were deployed for the march, but only 13 arrests were made for rebellion and possession of prohibited articles, according to police spokesperson Ilse Van de Keere. 
Also on Sunday, the Brussels-based European Commission agreed with Pfizer-BioNTech to accelerate the delivery of vaccines starting in a few weeks. The pharmaceutical giant will deliver an additional 20 million vaccine doses from January to March to the European Union’s 27 nations. 
The Belgian protest came one day after similar protests in other European capitals including Paris and London.  Nations across Europe are re-imposing tougher measures to stem a new wave of Covid-19 infections spurred by the highly transmissible Omicron variant, with the Netherlands leading the way by imposing a nationwide lockdown.

2,"PM Imran meets OIC head, ministers of several member states","Pakistan, Turkey and Malaysia once again announce decision to establish a joint media network.","ISLAMABAD: Sunday proved to be a busy day for Prime Minister Imran Khan as he made a speech at a conference of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and then met on its sidelines foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Iran and Malaysia besides secretary general of the OIC, where he stressed the need for tackling problems confronting the member states both individually as well as collectively. 
During the conference it was agreed that all Muslim states would actively confront Islamophobia in all its forms and a wing similar to Pakistan’s Rehmatul-lil-Alameen (PBUH) Authority would be set up at the OIC level for the purpose. 
Pakistan, Turkey and Malaysia once again announced decision to establish a joint media network. 
According to information ministry, Prime Minister Khan separately met OIC Secretary General Hissien Brahim Taha, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, Iran’s Foreign Minister Dr Amir Hossein Abdollahiyan and Malaysian Foreign Minister Dato Sri Saifuddin Abdullah. 
During his meeting with Iranian minister Abdollahiyan, Mr Khan highlighted fraternal relations with the neighbouring country and reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to further strengthening of ties. 
He praised Iran’s consistent support on the issue of Kashmir, especially at the Supreme Leader level, and again invited the Iranian president to visit Islamabad. 
Dr Abdollahiyan appreciated Pakis­tan’s decision to host the extraordinary session of the OIC and assured the prime minister of his country’s full cooperation to improve bilateral relations. 
While talking to Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal, the prime minister underscored the special significance of Islamabad’s ties with Riyadh, which were based on close ties, historic links, and support at the gross-roots level. 
Prince Faisal expressed the hope that the OIC conference would be instrumental in mobilising the international community to support the people of Afghanistan on humanitarian grounds. He also underscored the importance that Saudi Arabia attached to its relationship with Pakistan. 
Talking to Dawn, Information Minis­ter Fawad Chaudhry said Mr Khan and OIC Secretary General Taha agreed that a wing would be set up at the bloc’s level on the pattern of Pakistan’s Rehmatul-lil-Alameen Authority. 
He said the body at the OIC level would comprise a group of Muftis who could provide guidelines to all Muslims on various issues. “All such scholars will gather at one place through the authority to resolve issues involved in religious debates,” he added. 
The minister said that during his meetings with different delegates, the prime minister mainly discussed the crises confronting Afghanistan. 
Talking to journalists, Mr Chaudhry said a joint television channel would be set up to promote media links between Pakistan, Turkey and Malaysia. Initially a Joint Digital Platform would be developed between the three countries and later it would be upgraded as a joint television channel, he added.

3,Power companies seek 116pc higher fuel cost charges,"Nepra to examine if data, reasons provided by Discos justify such increase.","ISLAMABAD: Despite 67 per cent power supplies from cheap domestic resources with static prices, ex-Wapda distribution companies (Discos) have sought almost 116pc increase — Rs4.33 per unit (kWh) — in fuel price adjustment for electricity they sold in November to grab around Rs36 billion additional funds. 
The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has accepted their petition for public hearing on December 29 to examine if data and reasons provided by the power companies justified such a tariff increase under the monthly fuel price adjustment (FPA). The key reasons for putting additional burden on consumers appear to be over Rs13.5bn (Rs1.60 per unit) on account of some ‘previous adjustments’ or ‘supplemental charges’ and over Rs21bn higher costs of imported fuels consumed for just 33pc power generation. 

Nepra to examine if data, reasons provided by Discos justify such increase 

It has increasingly become common that reference fuel costs approved by the government and the regulator turn out to be highly unrealistic — a question mark on their economic and financial analytical skills. In recent months, the actual fuel costs have ranged between 44pc and 58pc higher than the reference rate but this is the first time the difference has been almost 115pc. 
This results in sudden price shocks to consumers on account of FPA on top of repeatedly increasing base power tariff at the behest of foreign lenders. This happens at a time when the government wants people to consume more electricity to reduce the impact of capacity charges. 
On behalf of Discos, the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) has claimed that consumers were charged a reference fuel cost of Rs3.738 per unit in November but actual cost turned out to be Rs8.07 per unit, hence an additional charge of about Rs4.333 per unit to consumers in the coming billing month i.e. January. 
The higher electricity rates, on a notification by the regulator, would be recovered from all consumers in the coming billing month (January) except those using less than 50 units per month. During the current billing month, the consumers have braved Rs4.75 per unit additional fuel cost. 
Data showed that the share of domestic fuel sources in overall power generation in November was significantly higher than that of October. The share of priceless hydropower supply in the overall basket registered a healthy growth of 33.2pc in November compared to 23.26pc in October. However, the share of hydropower was significantly lower than 36.24pc in September and 35pc in August with no fuel cost. 
This was followed by another major chunk of 17.5pc supply coming from nuclear power plants at just Rs1.024 per unit fuel cost. Nuclear power contributed about 12.33pc share to the national grid in October, 9.13pc in September and 10pc in August. Its fuel cost was also slightly lower than previous months. 
Yet another big contribution of about 13pc came from domestic gas at a generation cost of Rs7.864 per unit. Its share also increased from 9.67pc in October, 8.9pc in September and 8.17pc in August. The fuel cost of power produced from local gas slightly increased from Rs7.8 per unit in October but was still lower than Rs8.3 per unit in September.
