On Friday, 12 schools and 27 shops were sealed in different areas of Rawalpindi cantonment.
A senior RCB official told Dawn that the civic body had issued eviction notices to 469 private educational institutions and 2,880 commercial outlets located in residential areas of the cantonment.
He said teams had been formed to seal schools and colleges as per the lists given to them.

School owners to meet MLC director general, demand putting off operation till decision on review petition

The official said owners of private educational institutions met RCB officials and informed them that they had filed a review petition with the Supreme Court and demanded an early hearing on it.
“They requested the RCB not to initiate the operation to seal educational institutions till the court gives its decision on the petition,” he added.
However, RCB officials sought a stay order from the owners but they failed to produce it, therefore the cantonment board will go ahead with the operation, the official said.
“We will not stop the operation otherwise it will be a violation of the Supreme Court’s orders. The owners misinterpreted the decision as the court gave directions for schools to be shifted to commercial areas instead of residential areas,” he added.
Talking to Dawn, RCB spokesman Qaiser Mehmood said the board initiated action against commercial activities in residential areas including private educational institutions.
“We will not allow any school or college as well as shops and plazas to operate in residential areas,” he said, adding that school owners had been informed that the civic body would not violate the court’s orders.
Some school owners contacted the RCB and assured the officials that they would shift to commercial areas, he said, adding that, “we will get permission from the Military Lands and Cantonments (MLC) to open such sealed schools”.
On the other hand, owners of private educational institutions have also decided to meet the MLC director general on Monday and request him to give them time till Jan 5 as a date had been fixed to review their petition in the Supreme Court.
Ibrar Ahmed Khan, member of the Joint Action Committee of private educational institutions, told Dawn that cantonment boards of Rawalpindi and Chaklala had so far sealed 30 schools and colleges but the struggle to save the future of children and employees would continue.
“We have decided to meet the Military Lands and Cantonments director general and apprise him of the date (Jan 5) fixed by the Supreme Court to hear the review petition. We will request him to hold the operation till that date,” Mr Khan said, adding that the operation against educational institutions had been launched in 42 cantonments across the country.
“In Quetta, the cantonment authorities sealed the gates of schools while RCB and CCB closed only one gate and allowed the other gate to remain open to enable the school to function,” he said.

1,Raids underway to arrest suspects who escaped after police encounter in Pindi,Case registered under section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act and other charges.,"RAWALPINDI: Police have registered a case under section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) and other charges in connection with the alleged police encounter with a gang of suspected robbers which left two suspects dead and three police officials injured in Bahria Town Phase VIII early on Saturday morning.
Meanwhile, raids by specialised units of Islamabad police were underway to arrest the suspects who escaped after the encounter.
The FIR was registered in the Rawat police station on the complaint of Station House Officer (SHO) Margalla Inspector Abdul Ghafoor.
The complainant claimed in the FIR that he and his subordinates were on a special mission to apprehend a proclaimed offender, a Peshawar resident wanted in connection with a robbery in F-8 Markaz, when he received information that the suspect was hiding in a house in Bahria Town Phase VIII with looted goods.
He said following the information, reinforcement of police was called to Phase VIII at 6am and a house was surrounded by police who warned the suspected robbers residing in the house to surrender. But instead of giving up, the suspects opened fire on the police which resulted in injuries to constables Inam Rasool, Pervez Khan and head constable Bahar Ali of the Anti-Terrorist Squad of Islamabad.
The FIR said panic gripped the surrounding residential areas due to exchange of gunfire.
“Due to echo of gunfire, woman and children in the surrounding areas started screaming,” the FIR said, adding in the meantime four suspected robbers climbed to the rooftop of the house and started firing on the police.
Getting benefit from the thickly-populated area, the suspected robbers escaped. As the firing stopped, the police entered the house and found two bodies of unidentified persons lying on the rooftop and firearms left close to them.
Police claimed that the two persons had died from the firing of their accomplices who escaped from the scene.
One of the killed persons was wearing brown shalwar kameez and a Kalashnikov was lying close to his body. Besides, a 9mm pistol was also found from the scene. A Kalashnikov was also found near the second body.
Since the place of encounter was located within the Rawalpindi police jurisdiction, the Islamabad police had alerted the local police before the operation was conducted. However, the police have not described in the FIR how many criminals managed to escape and whether or not the police chased them.
According to sources, the suspects had taken the house in Bahria Town’s Ali Block Phase VIII on rent two weeks ago and the ICT police had been monitoring its tenants for the last two days.
They said one of the robbers snatched a car from its owner at F-8 on Friday night while his two accomplices were giving cover to him. After snatching the car, the two suspects came to the house in Ali Block.
The police, sources said, sneaked into the house from where sound of gunshots was heard in the area. After the gunfire stopped, the police claimed to have killed two of the robbers.

ISLAMABAD: Over 5,000 officials of law enforcement agencies and intelligence services have been deputed in the federal capital for the security of 70 delegates from the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) member and non-member states and international organisations who are expected to leave the capital city on Monday.
The delegates, 20 led by foreign ministers, reached Islamabad to attend the 17th extraordinary session of the OIC’s Council of Foreign Ministers called by Saudi Arabia.
The goal of the summit was to convince the countries to support people of Afghanistan and avoid chances of humanitarian crisis in the neighbouring country.
Initially, the district administration had considered suspending mobile phone service in the city from Dec 17 to 19.
However, Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed announced that the service will not be suspended as it would have made media coverage of the summit difficult.

6,PM’s intervention sought to halt work on Margalla Road,ISLAMABAD: Former bureaucrat Roedad Khan has urged Prime Minister Imran Khan to get work on the ongoing Margalla ...,"ISLAMABAD: Former bureaucrat Roedad Khan has urged Prime Minister Imran Khan to get work on the ongoing Margalla Road project stopped.
From the platform of Margalla Hills Society, Mr Khan wrote a letter to the prime minister seeking his intervention to get the project stopped. He maintained that the project was inaugurated before carrying out an environment impact assessment (EIA), which was against the law.
“The Margalla Hills National Park serves as lungs for the entire area of ICT and all these ill-planned projects are suffocating the situation. The city has a national park within it which is very rare, home to a diverse wildlife population and unique flora and fauna probably no other national park has such a rich biodiversity, which must be protected through smart zoning and maintenance of protected green areas,” he said.
“Cutting into green and making highways in and around the city defeats the purpose of the carefully delineated green master plan. A smart mobility plan needs to be put in place along with other zoning guidelines. These should be strictly followed. The master plan should not be used as excuse to destroy the city.”
He said if measures through a rigorous ecological and environment friendly zoning plan were not made at this stage, “we stand to lose this beautiful city to traffic concrete and pollution.”
On the other hand, the CDA, which is executing the project, has been stating that the road was part of Islamabad’s master plan.
In a recently-held public hearing, the CDA officials said besides other areas six planned residential sectors were dependent on the road. The CDA said the road was meant for smooth and uninterrupted traffic flow aimed at saving travel time and fuel.
The civic agency has earmarked Rs100 million for the environment side of the project and announced that 75 trees falling in the right of way of the project will be transplanted.
The CDA through Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) is constructing the 10-km-long road from Sangjani to D-12, where it will be linked with Khayaban-i-Iqbal.
The officials said the road would pass through CDA’s acquired land and its three km portion would fall in the national park area which was a permissible practice.

9,"Three years on, HEC still to appoint permanent executive director",Source says 49 candidates have applied but appointment committee is yet to hold interviews of shortlisted candidates.,"ISLAMABAD: Despite passage of three years, the post of a permanent executive director (ED) of the Higher Education Commission (HEC) has still not been filled.
The post of regular ED, who acts as the principal accounting officer, fell vacant in October 2018 after Dr Arshad Ali resigned.
After his resignation, the HEC advertised the post thrice but, as per officials in the commission’s regulatory body, it could not find a suitable candidate. Finally, in October last year, the HEC hired services of senior bureaucrat Dr Shaista Sohail on deputation basis against the post of ED.
However, she retired in August this year after reaching the age of superannuation, but she was given an extension to run the affairs of HEC. Meanwhile, the commission in September this year, announced the post for the fourth time in the last three years but the process was not completed.
According to a source, 49 candidates applied but the appointment committee is yet to hold interviews of shortlisted candidates. “The appointment process is in progress,” an HEC official said.
It is relevant to note here that the post of HEC chairman has been vacant since March this year when the government removed Dr Tariq Banuri by reducing his four-year term to two years through amendment to HEC ordinance. The ousted chairman filed a court case against his premature removal.
The court had barred the government from appointing a new chairman and the matter is still in court. Whereas, besides absence of a chairman and regular ED, three other important positions of members operations, academic and IT have been lying vacant for the last one year.
The HEC is the regulatory body of the higher education sector with a budget of over Rs100 billion and it is being run on ad-hoc basis.
“The government should immediately look into affairs of the HEC. There is need to probe into why the commission, which has spent billions of rupees for promotion of the higher education sector, failed to get a suitable candidate for the post of ED in response to earlier advertisements. While, in September this year, we announced the vacancy again, but still the matter is in progress,” the HEC official said.
Another officer said besides the appointment of a regular ED, the government should request the court for an early decision in Dr Banuri’s case.
“In case, the court restores him (Dr Banuri) to his position, he should immediately be allowed to hold office of chairman and in case, the court decides in the favour of the government, the government should appoint HEC chairman within a few weeks,” he said.

10,Pindi mayor plans massive drive against commercial buildings,Sardar Naseem says city saw mushroom growth of illegal constructions; Arif Abbasi holds civic bodies’ officials responsible,"RAWALPINDI: Mayor Sardar Naseem Khan has said the Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation (RMC) would launch a massive operation to check the status of all commercial buildings and clear the city of encroachments.
Talking to Dawn, Mayor Khan said the city had seen a rise in illegal constructions and encroachments during the last three years when the civic body was being run by unelected people.
After the restoration of the local government on the orders of the Supreme Court, the mayor said, he had decided to check the status of all commercial buildings as most of them were constructed without approval of building plans.
“A massive drive will be launched to check whether commercial plazas were constructed before their building plans had been approved,” he said, adding that in the last few years, provincial ministers and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leaders stopped operations against such buildings and the civic body approved the building plans after imposing fines.

Sardar Naseem says city saw mushroom growth of illegal constructions; Arif Abbasi holds civic bodies’ officials responsible

He said he had asked the RMC to submit a report to him on how many illegal buildings were legalised after fines were imposed on their owners. He said there were violations in many commercial plazas.
The mayor said he would also write letters to all other civic bodies and government departments to apprise them of the status of land and buildings in the city areas.
He said all the union council chairmen had informed him about illegal constructions and encroachments in their areas as well as public problems. They wanted to remove encroachments from all bazaars and roads to clear footpaths and roadsides from vendors, he added.
On the other hand, a senior RMC official told Dawn that Band Khana Road was built 40 years ago to provide alternative to Sadiqabad and Kuri roads.
“It was a residential zone but in the last few years all houses along the road have been converted into commercial outlets creating traffic hurdles,” he added.
The official said in many areas, workshops and plazas had been constructed without approval from the civic body, adding the bureaucracy ran the city’s affairs in consultation with local politicians.
“Last week, due to pressure from local politicians, the second floor of a commercial plaza on Liaquat Road was constructed but the building inspector of the area failed to take action against it,” the official claimed.
Most of the buildings on Murree Road, Liaquat Road, Raja Bazaar and Sadiqabad were built in violation of bylaws.
In Raja Bazaar, Iqbal Road, Sabzi Mandi and adjoining areas, it has been found that people have constructed six floors for commercial purposes. They even failed to adopt fire safety measures in the buildings.
When contacted, PTI Punjab Deputy General Secretary Arif Abbasi told Dawn that instead of levelling allegations it was the duty of the mayor to clear the city from all kinds of encroachments and illegal construction without any discrimination.
“Illegal constructions in the city are increasing and officials of the RMC or other civic bodies are responsible for it. Such things occurred in connivance with the civic body officials and PTI leaders are not involved in it. I issued notices to all illegal buildings on Murree Road in the past but they did not respond positively,” said Mr Abbasi, who served as the Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) chairman.

12,EIA for ongoing construction of Margalla Avenue demanded,ISLAMABAD: Civil society activists and environmentalists on Sunday demanded an environment impact assessment (EIA) ...,"ISLAMABAD: Civil society activists and environmentalists on Sunday demanded an environment impact assessment (EIA) of the ongoing construction of Margalla Avenue.
Speaking at a webinar organised by Development Communications Network (Devcom-Pakistan) on illegal intrusion into Margalla Hills National Park (MHNP), the participants urged the prime minister to take notice of alleged intrusion by the Capital Development Authority (CDA) inside the park for construction of Margalla Avenue without taking into account the Environmental Protection Order (EPO), issued by Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) over violation of the protected area’s boundary.
Devcom-Pakistan Executive Director Munir Ahmed said Margalla Avenue was launched in 2012 by Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani, the then prime minister of Pakistan. Questions about the project’s environmental impact were raised back then as well.
The Islamabad High Court (IHC) had already reserved its verdict two months back on the citizens’ petition. Six more public interest petitions had been clubbed with the first one. “CDA has continued its construction work at the avenue till today despite the case in the court of law, and the Pak-EPA has also issued an EPO. This is strange. CDA is not heeding the concerns of the stakeholders, and continuing violation of the rule of law”, he said.
Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) Chairperson Rina Saeed Khan said she was only concerned with what participants termed illegal encroachment by CDA into the MHNP. “We were repeatedly given assurances that the Margalla Avenue will not pass through the MHNP that is one of the 15 protected areas, Prime Minister Imran Khan had very proudly declared”, she said.
She said CDA should have halted the construction work until the verdict was announced. It is unethical that CDA kicked off construction without the approval of EIA and did not pay heed to the order of Pak-EPA.
Participants were informed that residents of D-12 had formed an action committee in a meeting on Sunday to interact with CDA about the project. They were of the view that the six-lane Margalla Avenue would increase traffic congestion, noise and air pollution besides disturbing residential sectors in its vicinity.
Hamid Sarfraz, a representative of the committee and a development professional, informed the audience that the badly planned Margalla Avenue was designed to end abruptly in D-12. It was noted with concern that partial completion of Margalla Avenue would bring traffic volume from a six-lane road to single lane service roads of D-12, causing air and noise pollution.
According to participants, residents had resolved that they would take legal measures to protect their right to a clean environment and freedom of movement.
