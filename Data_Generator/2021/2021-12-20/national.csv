1,Urdu criticism and controversies kicked up by Kaleemuddin Ahmad,Few critics of Urdu have been as controversial as Kaleemuddin Ahmad had become in his lifetime.,"Few critics of Urdu have been as controversial as Kaleemuddin Ahmad had become in his lifetime.  
Reason: Kaleemuddin Ahmad rejected Urdu ghazal, the crown jewel of Urdu poetry, terming it ‘a semi-barbarous genre’ and expressed his utter displeasure and disappointment over ‘non-existence’ of Urdu criticism. He rejected progressive poets’ works as “propaganda and sloganeering”. Even Allama Iqbal fell just short of his high standards. His provocative and dogmatic remarks caused uproar in literary circles and even today he is viewed, generally, as a pessimist who wrote on Urdu literature in a dismissive tone. 
Kaleem Sahib was initially impressed by Matthew Arnold. Then he was inspired by I. A. Richards, a critic known for his scientific approach towards literature. Later on, F. R. Leavis, the famous English critic whom Kaleem Sahib had met during his stay at Cambridge University, influenced him much. F. R. Leavis is often remembered for his belligerent and dogmatic attitude and his innuendoes about writers.  
In addition to influence of Leavis, Kaleemuddin Ahmed’s profound study of western literature induced a tendency in him to set Western literary theories and standards as a benchmark for writers and poets of Urdu. It resulted in his praising hardly a few authors of Urdu and shooting most of them down to rock-bottom. It is generally felt that at times Kaleemuddin Ahmed becomes a bit too harsh and sounds like ridiculing the critics, writers and poets of Urdu. 
Kaleemuddin Ahmed’s infamous sentence “ghazal is a semi-barbarous literary genre” had first been published in introduction that he wrote to Gul-e-Naghma, (1939), a collection of poetry by Azeemuddin Ahmad, his father (surprisingly, the introduction labels his father’s poetry as quite impressive).  
Urdu Shaeri Par Aik Nazar (1940), a critical study of Urdu poetry, made ripples that never really stopped hitting the shores. He repeated his views on ghazal in this book and advocated banishing ghazal from Urdu poetry, completely ignoring the intricacies, symbolic values of words and profound meanings that ghazal offers.  
His Urdu Tanqeed Par Aik Nazar (1942), a critical study of Urdu criticism, is another work that caused tumult. The book begins with a rather unvarnished first sentence, denying the very existence of Urdu criticism: “the existence of Urdu criticism is only hypothetical as it is the point in Euclidean geometry [which has no width, length or thickness] or the proverbial elusive waist of a beloved in Urdu poetry”.  
It was an era when stalwarts like Moulvi Abdul Haq, Mohiuddin Qadri Zor, Hamid Hasan Qadri, Niaz Fatehpuri, Akhter Husain Raipuri and some others were writing criticism. But Kaleemuddin Ahmad did not approve of any of his contemporaries or predecessors. A positive outcome, however, of this harsh criticism was that it inspired a research dissertation on Urdu criticism titled Urdu Tanqeed Ka Irtiqa. Penned by Dr Ibadat Barelvi and first published by Anjuman Taraqqi-e-Urdu in 1949, it proved that criticism was very much existent in Urdu and Altaf Husain Hali’s Muqaddama-e-Shear-o-Shaeri written in 1890s was the first treatise on Urdu criticism, albeit not without shortcomings. Moulvi Abdul Haq in the preface wrote that the book proves “Urdu criticism is neither a beloved’s elusive waist nor Euclid’s hypothetical point”, apparently spoofing at Kaleemuddin Ahmad’s critical ideas.  
Another reply came from Dr Maseeh-uz-Zaman in the shape of his book Urdu Tanqeed Ki Tareekh (1954). In his introduction, the author says that he began writing the book on the history of Urdu criticism after publication of the book by Kaleemuddin Ahmed on Urdu criticism, so “it took me 10 years to find the beloved’s elusive waist”. Period. So one may disagree with Kaleemuddin Ahmad’s notions but he has had deep impact on Urdu’s literary world and proved to be a catalyst for two serious works on Urdu criticism.  
Kaleemuddin Ahmad was a critic, research scholar, academician and poet. He was born on September 15, 1908, in Patna. Having majored in English from Patna, he got a scholarship and went to Cambridge University. Returning with a degree he chose teaching profession for a livelihood.  
Some of Kaleemuddin Ahmad’s other books are Fan-e-Dastan Goi (1944), Sukhan Hai Guftani (1955), Divan-e-Jahan (1959), Amali Tanqeed (1963), Kulliyaat-e-Shaad (1975) and Iqbal: Aik Mutal’a (1979). He penned his autobiography Apni Talash Mein (1975) in three volumes. A six-volume English-Urdu dictionary, a remarkable work, was published from India under the supervision of Kaleemuddin Ahmad.  
Just as the influence of F. R. Leavis over readers and critics decreased after early awe and he was increasingly viewed as an idiosyncratic critic who had carved out a place for himself among prominent English critics, Kaleemuddin Ahmad, too, is seen as a critic of Urdu whose influence has waned, but no work on Urdu criticism can be termed complete without referring to him. 
Kaleemuddin Ahmad died in Patna on December 22, 1983.

He inspected wards to review medical facilities, sanitation and other arrangements and was dissatisfied over the poor cleanliness condition at Allied Hospital and directed the authorities to improve the arrangements.

Patients expressed satisfaction over the behaviour of doctors and other paramedical staff and facilities available in the hospitals. He added that better look after of the patients could be ensured by displaying the true spirit of humanity despite limited resources. 
He directed the doctors and other paramedical staff to treat the patients in a well-behaved manner. He also directed them to ensure the best medical facilities, availability of medicines and attendance of staff. He said that required resources would be provided for ensuring the provision of better health facilities besides further improving the standard of health services. 
He said that adequate funds would be allocated for district hospitals in the annual development programme. The chief secretary also issued instructions to provide more warm blankets for the visitors of the Pannahgahs. 
The chief secretary was briefed that meal was being served to 1,600 people on a daily basis in the Pannahgahs. Later, he presided over a meeting at the commissioner’s office in the evening and reviewed the various government initiatives, including development schemes of Faisalabad division, an operation against encroachments, the steps taken for the eradication of polio and dengue. 
He said that no compromise would be made in the implementation of the annual development programme. He told DCs to pay special attention on the schemes of the Annual Development Programme and informed him if they faced any problem in the release of funds.
The chief secretary said that obtaining the real objectives of the Sugarcane (Development) Cess Fund was the responsibility of the administration as the fund can only be spent on the roads which are being used for transporting sugarcane. He ordered all possible steps to retrieve state land from land grabbers. The chief secretary asked for accelerating the corona vaccination campaign in Faisalabad. He said that activities should immediately be started to eradicate dengue larva. It was informed in the briefing that 633 acres in Faisalabad, 40 acres in Jhang and 16,421 kanals in Toba Tek Singh and five acres in Chiniot have been evacuated during the last three months.

4,PML-N assails PM for ‘defaming’ country to hide own corruption,Marriyum says it seems Imran doesn’t understand the sensitivity of OIC gathering.,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) on Sunday castigated Prime Minister Imran Khan for allegedly defaming the country and its political parties only to hide his own corruption at a time when foreign dignitaries were in the capital to attend the extraordinary meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) on Afghanistan.
Speaking at a news conference, PML-N’s information secretary and MNA Marriyum Aurangzeb asked the prime minister to step down from the office, if he really wanted to provide relief to the masses.
Referring to the prime minister’s interview to Al Jazeera on Friday in which he had once again blamed the past rulers’ corruption for the “country’s destruction”, she said the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) had already completed more than three years of its term, but it seemed that Imran Khan had been suffering from “Sharif family phobia” as he kept on mentioning the names of Nawaz Sharif and Shehbaz Sharif all the time, instead of highlighting his own achievements.
In his interview, Mr Khan had stated that the developing world was poor because its ruling elite siphoned off money and laundered it into offshore accounts. 

Marriyum says it seems Imran doesn’t understand the sensitivity of OIC gathering

He had stated that fighting with the two family-led political parties was like fighting a mafia. He alleged that both the parties (the PML-N and the PPP) used money, state resources as well as the media against him. He said that Pakistan was being ruled by “two corrupt families” who had come into power just for making money.
Ms Aurangzeb questioned the timing of, what she called, the political interview and alleged that it was an attempt to sabotage and damage the country’s image at a time when the foreign ministers of the Islamic countries were arriving in Pakistan for the OIC meeting. She alleged that Mr Khan had committed the same act when the Chinese president was to visit the country in 2014 during the PML-N government’s time.
She said it seemed that the prime minister did not possess the mental capacity to understand the sensitivity and importance of the OIC gathering and how he should present a positive image of the country to the leaders of the Muslim world in Pakistan.
This, she said, was because Imran knew nothing other than persecuting and victimising the opposition and blaming them for his failures. She alleged that Imran was bringing a bad name to Pakistan only to hide his own incompetence.
Ms Aurangzeb, who had served as information minister during the previous PML-N government, said despite keeping Leader of the Opposition Shehbaz Sharif in jail for over a year on “fictitious charges”, imprisoning PML-N leaders in death row cells, abusing power and weaponising and misusing the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and Federal Investigative Agency (FIA) and every national institution, Imran Khan could not prove a single penny of corruption on the PML-N leadership.
She said the PTI government and its “rented touts” had already been embarrassed by the courts because they had never produced any evidence to back their false cases.
On the contrary, she said, not a single one of the dozens of mega corruption scandals of the present PTI government were even touched upon by NAB, FIA or any national institution.
“Imran Khan and his mafias usurped trillions of rupees in corruption but none of them were held accountable under this government that pledged to be the so-called flag-bearer of anti-corruption,” she said, alleging that Imran Khan was helping these mafias and cartels because they were running his home and everyday expenses.
The PML-N spokesperson said Imran’s former financier Jahangir Tareen used to give him Rs3.5 million every month as claimed by former PTI member retired Justice Wajeehuddin. She stated that even people within the PTI now openly said that Imran did not pay for even a single one of his shoelaces.
“How can a person who is financially compromised and indebted to his financiers, hold anyone accountable? How can such a person be called clean when his existence depends on corruption money of others? How can Imran say no to those who run his house?”
The former minister alleged that Imran Khan was clearly and directly involved in every single one of the corruption acts that robbed the nation. She said the prime minister gave permission to export sugar and flour when he was explicitly told that there was a shortage in the country. Later, she alleged, the prime minister allowed import of sugar and flour at extremely costly rates and even gave needless subsidies to his “mafia friends”. 
Calling Imran Khan “the most corrupt leader in the country’s history”, she alleged that he was the only one to facilitate corruption institutionally.

5,Cotton production up 44pc to 7.3m bales,Output in Punjab stands at 3.8m bales compared to 3.5m bales in Sindh,"HYDERABAD: The country’s cotton output stood at 7.27 million bales as of Dec 15, showing a year-on-year increase of 44 per cent, the Pakistan Cotton Ginners’ Association (PCGA) reported on Saturday.
Of the total, Punjab’s cotton ginning factories produced 3.77 million bales, which was 27pc higher than 2.98m bales produced during the same period a year ago.
Sindh was not far behind and generated over 3.5m bales, an increase of 68pc compared to the same period last year when the output was little over 2m bales. 
A bale of cotton in Pakistan weighs around 170kg. 

Output in Punjab stands at 3.8m bales compared to 3.5m bales in Sindh  

Sanghar district topped with cotton arrival figures of 1.3m bales, followed by Bahawalnagar district with 1.04m bales. 
A total of 133 ginning factories are operational in the country, according to the PCGA.
Sindh’s output
The low cotton production in Sindh last year was mainly because of heavy rains in the Left Bank areas where cotton is commonly grown. Districts like Sanghar, Mirpurkhas, Tando Allahyar and Umerkot were badly hit. In contrast, no major damages were reported to the cotton crop this year amid moderate monsoon rainfall. 
“An increase in Sindh’s cotton output this year is mainly due to favourable weather and less rainfall, which remained crop-friendly. But the actual issues around the seed quality still remain unaddressed,” said Mahmood Nawaz Shah, the vice president of Sindh Abadgar Board.
Lal Chand, a cotton ginner, linked the higher production figures to better returns earned by growers last season amid a shortage of phutti (unginned cottonseed with the attached lint).
The country produced 12.9m bales during the 2009-10 period, according to the Economic Survey of Pakistan. Sindh’s share that year was 4.2m bales, according to the Sindh agriculture department’s figures. Since then, the province has failed to achieve such production figures, which now hover around 3.2m to 3.5m bales. 
This countrywide cotton production of 7.2m bales so far indicates that Pakistan would have to import cotton again to meet the textile industry’s requirement of around 8m. 
Dr Yusuf Zafar, a former chairman of the Pakistan Agricultural Research Council, called for taking the increase in cotton production as an opportunity. “We should not get complacent about these figures. Such production is largely due to weather and international market dynamics. The element of stability and sustainability still eludes our cotton sector,” he said.
Sindh has the Cotton Research Insti­tute (CRI) in Sakrand, which works un­der the Punjab-based Pakis­tan Cen­tral Cotton Committee (PCCC). How­ever, the CRI continues to face strength issues, with the federal government placing it under different ministries — commerce, textile and national food security — over the years. Currently, the institute is under the Ministry of National Food Security and Research.
Nadeem Shah, a PCCC member from Sindh, said the CRI had produced some of its own cottonseed, which had led to better yields than Bt cotton.

During the harbour phase of the exercise, which was held recently, operational and tactical-level discussions and pre-exercise conferences were conducted.  
Besides, the commanding officers of the visiting RNO ships called on the commander of Pakistan Fleet and Commander Coast to discuss matters of mutual interests. 
Enhancement of bilateral ties in all spheres were also reaffirmed. The commanding officers of visiting RNO ships extended gratitude for the wholehearted support provided by the Pakistan Navy for the conduct of TAT-21. 
The sea phase of the exercise comprised counter-terrorism, anti-air and anti-surface warfare operations with an overall aim to curb illicit activities at sea. 
The Chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral Mohammed Amjad Khan Niazi, also visited the RNO ships and interacted with the officers and men onboard. 
The Exercise TAT-21 provided an avenue of mutual learning, interoperability and opportunity for both navies to further hone their professional skills.  
Exercises between the two navies have regularly been conducted since 1990. The last exercise in the TAT series was conducted in Oman waters in 2019. 
Regular conduct of bilateral naval exercise between the Pakistan Navy and the Royal Navy of Oman are indicative of long-standing brotherly relations between the two countries in general and both navies in particular.
