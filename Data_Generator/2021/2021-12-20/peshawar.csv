0,LG elections: Slow polling dampens voters’ enthusiasm in Peshawar,Opposition parties allege that the polling process was intentionally kept slow in areas considered their stronghold.,"PESHAWAR: Although Peshawarities came out from their houses in a large number to cast their votes in local bodies’ elections on Sunday, yet slow polling at majority of the polling stations dampened the enthusiasm of voters as well candidates.
More than 5,000 candidates were in the run for seven tehsil councils, 357 village and neighbourhood councils, tehsil chairman and mayor seats in the provincial capital. The authorities had set up more than 1,200 polling stations and deployed over 11,000 security personnel for polls security.
The major contest was for the seat of Peshawar mayor for which all the major political parties including PTI, ANP, JUI-F, PPP and JI had fielded their candidates.
Talking to journalists, ANP candidate for Peshawar mayor seat Haji Sher Rahman said that a large number of voters turned up at the polling stations. However, he said, the polling process was very slow as Election Commission of Pakistan had deputed inexperience staff at the polling stations.
Hakim Khan, a resident of Akhoonabad area, falling in neighbourhood council-56, told Dawn that the process of polling was very slow. Standing in a long queue at Akhoonabad No-4 polling station, he said that he was standing in the queue for the last two hours while it would take another hour to cast vote.
Hasan Khan, a resident of Gharibabad area falling in neighbourhood council-62, demanded of the government to increase the number of polling stations in future as the population increased while the number of polling stations was the same.
He alleged that ECP deputed inexperienced staff at their polling station that was taking a lot of time to complete the process required for casting a vote.
At polling station No.467 in Sufaid Dheri, around 600 votes were polled of 1,800 at 2pm that was 30 per cent of the registered votes. On the other hand, voters were waiting for their turn in long queue outside the polling station.
One of the features of that polling station was presence of voters belonging to the Christian community as they have a sizeable population in this neighbourhood.
Similarly, at another polling station in Academy Town, around 660 votes were polled of the 1,500 at around 2:40pm.
Some of the polling booths were established on the second floor of the government schools, causing inconvenience to senior citizens as well as persons with disabilities in casting their votes.
In Garhi Hayat Khan area of Hazarkhwani-II neighbourhood council, the voters were seen in cramped conditions as the polling station was established in a small government primary school.
In several areas of the provincial capital, scuffles and altercations were witnessed among the supporters of different political parties when they raised objections over each other’s voters. Due to these scuffles and altercations, the polling process was also stopped for some time at several polling stations.
The opposition parties alleged that the polling process was intentionally kept slow in those areas, which were considered stronghold of opposition parties.

An expert on local bodies’ elections said that one of the major reasons of slow polling was that of multiple voting, as each of the voter had to cast six votes including for general councillor, youth, peasant, women, minority and tehsil chairman.
Similarly, the polling staff also had to write down the number of Computerised National Identity Card of the voter on the counter file of the ballet paper and also to put the thumb impression of the voter on all six ballot papers that delayed the process.
In the provincial capital, in several areas, polling continued after the closing hours because of presence of large number of voters on the premises of the respective polling station.
In neighbourhood council of Gulbahar area of Peshawar, ECP postponed polling after one of the candidates allegedly broke the ballot box and thrown away the ballot papers.  
In Mardan, polling was postponed in two village councils of Mardan  tehsil owing to wrong publication of candidates’ symbols on the ballot  papers. 
The relevant officials said that elections on the two  farmers’ seats in village council Gujar Garhi-2 and Behram Khan Kallay  village council had been postponed due to the incorrect publication of  symbols on the ballet papers. 
DRO Habibullah Arif said he  postponed the elections on the two seats when the candidates concerned  complained to him that their symbols were wrongly published. 
Meanwhile,  Secretary Election Commission of Pakistan Umar Hameed Khan on Sunday  visited different polling stations in the district to review  arrangements for the local body elections. 
Talking to  mediapersons, he expressed his satisfaction over the arrangements.  Answering a query, he said inquiries would be held over genuine  complaints of candidates. 
Asked about use of electronic voting  machines in next elections, he said they were holding pilot projects so  as to make possible the use of EVMs in the coming polls. 
The  elections in the five tehsils of Mardan were held peacefully and no  untoward incident had been reported in the 3,215 polling stations of the  district. 
In Swabi, the ECP secretary visited polling stations  in Anbar region and appreciated facilities for the voters. In the  district, the arrival of voters at polling stations was slow till 11am  due to severe cold. 
Also in the day, one person suffered injuries  in Azad Kashmir village inside a polling station when his rivals opened  fire on him. Clashes were also reported from Tordher and other areas,  but police succeeded to control the situation. 
In Lakki Marwat  district, polling for the seats of tehsil chairman and general, women,  peasants, youth and minorities councillors ended peacefully. 
In  Multan Manjiwala village, two groups exchanged fire over a poll-related  issue, but no one was injured. Two villagers were reportedly wounded  when two groups traded fire in Dadiwala locality of Kurrum Par area. 
In  Paharkhel Thall village, a single female voter polled her vote at a  female polling station till midday. No female voters turned up for  casting vote at another female and a combined polling station in the  locality though the polling staff remained present till the closing  hours. 
In Haripur, polling for the LG elections 2021 was completed peacefully amid strict security. 
In  Dera Ismail Khan, the polling process for LG elections ended peacefully  on Sunday though enthusiasm of voters had somewhat waned after the  tragic assassination of ANP candidate for city mayor slot the previous  day. 
Senator Maulana Ataur Rehman, JUI-F provincial chief, polled his vote in his home constituency of Abdulkhel. 
In  Kohat, FC had to be called by additional deputy commissioner Bashir  Ahmed after receiving reports of the entry of people in Bilitang polling  stations. A similar situation was also witnessed in some other Kohat  polling stations.

“We had taken up this issue with the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and previous governments seeking ownership of the forests, but to no avail. Now, we have moved the court of law to get our rights,” Iqbal Khan Tarind, a local elder, told a jirga held in Judbah on Sunday. 
He told the jirga that their panel of lawyers had submitted a writ petition with the Abbottabad circuit bench seeking the change of status of the local forests from reserves ones to the protected forests. 
“These forests are owned by the local tribes, but the forest department is not permitting them even to chop trees for firewood and construction,” Mr Tarind said. 
He said that the people of Torghar, which was given the status of a settled district through a presidential order in 2011 from a tribal belt of Mansehra district, were still without basic facilities.

3,Govt help sought to boost Ramghani sheep farming,HARIPUR: The Ramghani breed of sheep has great potential to increase the income of farmers together with meeting the...,"HARIPUR: The Ramghani breed of sheep has great potential to increase the income of farmers together with meeting the country’s mutton and fine quality wool needs.
The claim was made by Dr Sohrab Khan, director livestock experiment station, Jabba, while talking to Dawn here.
He said Ramghani breed, one of the total 30 breeds of sheep of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, was in fact a new breed naturally developed after a cross between American Rambouillet ram and local Kaghani ewe.
He said the experiment was carried out at the station under a USAID-funded project launched in 1957. Since the thin-tailed American Rambouillet and Kaghani sheep could live in colder places like Malakand, the then government had imported the first herd of 80 ewe and five rams for growth of the breed. The second herd of 300 ewes and 21 rams was imported in 1992.
The veterinary department succeeded in developing Ramghani breed at the Jabba station, the South Asia’s only livestock experiment centre, Dr Sohrab said, adding wool of the new breed was soft and its per kilogramme rate was Rs80 to Rs120. Dr Sohrab said Ramghani sheep weighed 40 to 60 per cent more than the Kaghani breed. 
He said the Jabba experiment station had so far distributed over 6,500 rams among the shepherds at subsidised rates. He said a Ramghani ram was sold for Rs8,000 to Rs10,000 for ensuring growth in its population and improving shepherds’ livelihood sources.
To a question about fast growth of Ramghani breed for meeting the country’s mutton needs through artificial insemination, Dr Sohrab said artificial insemination was not successful in small animals as the process was laborious and painful for small animals like sheep.
About slow growth of Ramghani, he said despite repeated requests the government had not imported new herd since 1992. He said 80 ewes and five rams were sufficient to help the Jabba centre to meet the objective of further increasing Ramghani population. 
He said insufficient budget to provide feed to a population of 450 sheep and shortage of veterinary doctors were other reasons hampering increase in new breed population. 
He said there was dire need of setting up three more such centres in Alai tehsil of Battagram, Galiyat in Abbottabad and in Upper Kaghan as these areas provided natural habitat to Ramghani breed.
He said facilities like meat processing and grading of wool obtained from Ramghani at the Jabba centre could help government increase its revenues.
He also recommended establishing a small animals directorate in Hazara on the pattern of Punjab for further growth in population of goat and sheep.
Dr Nasir Abbas Tanoli, veterinary officer, at the directorate of livestock in Peshawar, estimated that about 80-90 per cent of sheep population in Hazara division comprised Ramghani breed.
Meanwhile, according to “first checklist and distribution of sheep bread of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa” published by Journal of Entomology and Zoology Studies in 2017, the thin-tailed Ramghani breed had 11.08 per cent diversity, the second largest percentage after 13.75 per cent of Australian breed in KP.

4,Shortage of beds at hospitals affecting treatment of sick children,Paediatricians want unnecessary referral of patients to Peshawar stopped.,"PESHAWAR: Shortage of children beds at government hospitals has been affecting the health of patients requiring specialised care as they are being referred from district hospitals to medical teaching institutions unnecessarily, according to paediatricians.
They said that referral of children from different districts caused shortage of space in tertiary care hospitals in Peshawar. Pakistan Paediatrics Association (PPA) wants the district level hospitals not to refer patients unnecessarily and send only those, who are not manageable at the local level, to tertiary care health facilities.
The office-bearers of PPA told this scribe that they wanted the medical directors of MTIs and medical superintendents of the district headquarters hospitals to countersign the referral of the patients so that sending of normal patients to Peshawar could be stopped.
On December 14, the chairperson of department of child health at Khyber Teaching Hospital wrote a letter to the administration that the department was on the brink of collapse owing to admission of a large number of critically-ill children and neonates from all over the province due to seasonal respiratory sicknesses.
“The medical staff and services provided could cater for only approximately 164 patients (neonates and children), however, over the last 24 hours we have admitted 336 patients,” said the latter. This large number of admission of patients has been observed over the last few weeks that is making the work environment difficult and causing stressful situations for both staff and parents of sick children.
“In order to deliver safe patient care, it is therefore requested to stop all regular and elective admissions including those of seriously-ill children as beds are not available,” said the letter.
It said that in case of serious ailment, the health workers should provide emergency treatment to patients before shifting them to the nearest hospital with available beds. The hospital has two wards with 180 beds for children and a nursery ward where 45 beds exist.
Ideally, there should be one patient on one bed but the number of patients was far higher to accommodate them, it said.
According to PPA, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is the only province where a children hospital does not exist and the number of children beds is only 2,000 compared to more than 50, 000 for adult patients.
Situation with regard to children beds is no different in Lady Reading Hospital, which has 102 beds in three wards and 28 emergency beds.
The hospital has 50 nursery beds but owing to more patients, two patients have to be admitted on a single bed. Same is true for Hayatabad Medical Complex where 30 beds for neonates and six ICU beds are not sufficient to meet the requirements.
PPA office-bearers said that children were dying of simple ailments owing to shortage of health services and delay in completion of Khyber Institute of Child Health, which was started 13 years ago. Except, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, all other provinces had child health institutes, they said.
They said that common health issues among neonates were prematurity, low birth weight and perinatal asphyxia (oxygen deficiency at birth) that were manageable through infrastructure and trained and well-equipped health workers.
In Pakistan, about 54 of 1,000 neonates died per day and half of them expired for want of treatment, they added.
“The province requires nursery wards at district and tehsil level to bring down mortalities because many children die while being transported to Peshawar.""
Pakistan has 5.6 doctors and 8.1 nurses per 10,000 newborns,” said the PPA representatives.

They asked the government and C&W department to avoid further occupation of their land. 
They said that they would move the court and protest on the roads if more land was occupied. 
They also demanded the government to allow them for construction on both sides of the road. 
The landowners also urged the local lawmakers to support their genuine demands. 
Also in the day, the elders belonging to Ouch town claimed that the administration was trying to demolish houses and shops on the pretext of an anti-encroachment campaign. 
A meeting in this regard was held in Ouch, which was attended by former federal minister Malik Azmat Khan, Muddasir Khan and others. 
The participants said the road within the locality was wide enough in Ouch while its extension would affect scores of local shopkeepers and landowners. 
The meeting decided that a delegation of the affected people would meet the Lower Dir administration to inform it about their concerns. 
PML-N MEETING: A meeting of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, Lower Dir chapter, was held in Timergara on Sunday.

6,Oldest Buddhist apsidal temple of country found in Swat,Italian Mission director Prof Luca M Olivieri says the sacred structure dates back to the Mauryan period.,"SWAT: The archaeologists have discovered the most ancient Buddhist apsidal temple of Pakistan in Bazira area of Barikot tehsil in Swat.
The site was discovered by archaeologists of Ca’ Foscari University and Italian Archaeological Mission in collaboration with the provincial department of archaeology and museums.
Italian Ambassador to Pakistan Andreas Ferrarese told Dawn that he was excited that the new discovery was also made by Italian archaeologists.
“It is so impressive to find something common between the archaeology of Pakistan and that of Italy. It is something that shows that even in antiquity we have a kind of globalisation where people had exchange of certain techniques and ideas of culture and religions which is astonishing. The more we search for the past, the more we find that we have future together,” he said.
According to Prof Luca M Olivieri, the director of Italian Mission, it is possible to date the foundation of the Buddhist sacred structure to the Mauryan period, certainly to the 3rd century BC. 

Italian Mission director Prof Luca M Olivieri says the sacred structure dates back to the Mauryan period

This was followed by a major reconstruction undertaken in the 2nd century BC.

When the Greeks arrived and refortified the city of Bazira, known to them from the times of Alexander the Great, they found an existing structure constructed during the Mauryan period at the time of Ashoka.
Since then, after the rule of King Menander in the mid-second century, the monument was enhanced and kept in function for centuries till the third and fourth century when it was eventually abandoned, as the Kushan city of Bazira was razed by an earthquake.
“This is an astonishingly important discovery as it attests a new architectural shape of Buddhist structure in Gandhara. We only have one other example of apsidal temple in a city at Sirkap, Taxila. 
“However, the apsidal temple of Bazira is so far the earliest example of this architecture in Pakistan,” said Prof Luca.
He said that the new discovery was revolutionary because it was proving the presence of Buddhists since the third century in Swat. 
The discovery also confirms the claim that Indo-Greek ruler Menander and his successors supported Buddhism.
The archaeologists unearthed not only a well-preserved four-metre high monument, the apsidal temple, but also one of the main streets of the ancient city leading eventually to the discovery of one of the gates of the city.
“We have found coins, among which a silver specimen issued by King Menander, an onyx-made seal decorated with a Hellenistic intaglio depicting the image of a youth in Greek attire with a Kharosthi inscription, a monumental Kharosthi epigraph, many other Kharosthi inscriptions on pots, and potsherds belonging to the Indo-Greek cultural horizon such as fish 
plates and polished black pottery that imitates Attic models,” said Dr Michele Minardi, another Italian archaeologist.
The site has been plundered by illegal excavators between 2008 and 2010. If it was not plundered, the scientific output would have been even more important, said the archaeologists.
Dr Abdul Samad Khan, the director archaeology, said that the new discovery was important in different ways, especially in connection with religious harmony, tolerance and multiculturalism in Gandhara period.
“The entire province and Swat are extremely rich in archaeological treasure. So far, archaeologists have only explored about five per cent sites and the remaining 95 per cent are still unexplored,” he told Dawn.

7,Tribesmen take interest in first-ever LG polls in former Fata,"The process of polling, however, remained slow in tribal districts owing to complex formalities and lack of awareness.","PESHAWAR: Voters showed interest in the local bodies’ elections that took place for the first time in three newly-merged districts of erstwhile Fata as young candidates were among the contestants and the interest shown by women seemed departure from the general elections wherein such spirit was missing.
The process of polling, however, remained slow in tribal districts owing to complex formalities and lack of awareness, especially among women, about the local bodies system.
Former president Gen Pervez Musharraf had made an attempt to introduced local government system in the erstwhile Fata in 2004. Instead of holding general elections, sub-tribes were asked to nominate their representatives while political agents were empowered to nominate women and tribal elders as members of these councils.
The councils were given the role of consultative forums to discuss development activities, law and order issues and other subjects. Respective political agents were appointed conveners of these councils. But the system failed to deliver and ultimately vanished.
On Sunday, elections took place in Khyber, Mohmand and Bajaur tribal districts. Local bodies’ polls will be held in the remaining four tribal districts in the second phase on January 16.
In Khyber, as opposed to general elections wherein commonly wealthy candidates are fielded by the parties, young people and women contested the polls. Women were seen active in running door-to-door electioneering.
Women not only cast votes but also took part in the elections as candidates. However, there was no specific participation of minorities as 300 Sikh and Christian families have shifted from Khyber to Peshawar and other areas.
However, it was witnessed that most of the voters were not very familiar with the system of local bodies’ polls. Sporadic incidents of poll suspension were received from a number of women polling stations.
Polling was temporarily suspended at the polling station of government higher secondary school for girls owing to objections of favouritism levelled against the polling staff by some candidates. The issue was, however, later resolved and the polling restated.
Similar complaints and polling suspensions were also witnessed at some other female polling stations in Khar Ghali, Sultankhel, Sadokhel, Railway Station, Mian Marcha in Malagori and some other stations both in Bara and Jamrud.
In Mohmand, overall turnout remained satisfactory, however, most of the women polling stations were closed down owing to clashes between rival parties.
Many voters returned without casting their ballots as they waited in long queues for painfully long hours and stood there even after the time was over but couldn’t cast votes. Shortage of women polling booths also compelled the people to get back to homes without polling their vote.
The voters were kept waiting for hours at the polling station set up in Government Girls Degree College Chanda Haleemzai owing to insufficient arrangements for women polling booths.
In Bajuar, polling for the first ever local government elections was held amid tight security.
Although the polling in most of the areas was held in peaceful environment, yet clashes among supporters of various candidates and political parties were also witnessed in some areas.
The voters showed great interest in the elections. However, most of them complained about the slow process of polling. The staffers at several polling stations were also inexperienced that caused troubles to the voters.
During visits to several polling stations, this correspondent observed that there was no female polling staff that delayed the polling process. Polling at several such stations was started at 2pm. Scores of voters, mostly women, who were present inside at the polling stations continued to cast their vote till 7:30pm.
A team of the senior officials of the district administration, Election Commission of Pakistan and police visited a number of most sensitive and sensitive polling stations in different areas of the district to check arrangements.

The association’s president Abid Yaar claimed that Dostan mine in Akhorwal was closed by the inspectorate of mines a month ago after it was declared dangerous for work, but despite that the mine was opened and labour sent for cutting coal in dangerous conditions without caring for the safety of miners. 
Both the victims were buried at their ancestral graveyard in Chichlo area of Shangla.

The poem went something like this:
Zakia’s Smile
When sighs arise from every lip,
Signifying the distress,
One is undergoing,
Someone estimable,
Concealing all her agonies,
Bequeath upon everyone,
Her life-bestowing smile;
Her teeth shining behind lips,
As a moon shines behind clouds,
Her smile creates,
A new zeal in dying souls
Urging them to live,
Embellishing their eyes with joy
She was the spring
That Khizr discovered
This was the time when my only acquaintance with her was that of a student with a teacher. Over the years, our bond evolved into a strong relationship that withstood the tests of time. Sure enough, I would become restless, if I did not see her for a few days.
This iron lady, who was very tough with her subordinates and house staff, always had a broad smile to offer to all her patients. 
I remember very fondly her telling us off as students, for not meeting her expectations (which were always very high!) but as she would turn to her patient, her face would soften into a smile. This revealed the love and kindheartedness she had for her patients, which was, and still is, a glowing example for all of us.
“There is only one Mard among all the doctors and that happens to be Prof Zakia Minhas,” governor and chief minister of the then NWFP Gen Fazle Haq often used to reiterate. He was very fond of her administrative capabilities and appointed her as administrator of Khyber Teaching Hospital. 
The hospital became cleaner, doctors and nurses became more punctual, the nursing call system started working, and poor patients started getting medicines. 
The hospital store was an absolute mess when she took over but responded to the demands of the wards and patients in her time. The corridors used to shine, the bed sheets cleaner and whiter; the place became well-known for its friendlier and cleaner atmosphere.
Many doctors owe their careers to her. She was obsessed with the welfare of people around her. All her staff had to work hard for post-graduation. She treated teaching with sanctity and expected doctors to improve their clinical skills and background knowledge. All her ward rounds were conducted very solemnly, and they were full of practical tips. Most of the practicing obstetricians and gynaecologists are products of her training and hard work.
One factor that distinguished her from others is her belief in human sanctity and respect for human values. 
I believe, when her accounts will be checked on the Day of Judgment, she will have countless prayers from poor people, who owe their lives to her. She will have blessings of unknown faces, whose children were fed by her. 
Many hearts will recommend her, who kept beating on the energy provided by her donated pacemakers. Many young persons will have their hands raised up in the air, for the books and clothes they got from her. She was in the forefront of all philanthropic activity in the province, may it be Shaukat Khanum Hospital or CHEF.
She was a gift of God to the people of Pakistan; Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Peshawar in particular. People of her qualities are born after centuries. The love that she had for the underprivileged people of our society was highly commendable. 
Her enthusiasm for teaching was inspiring and her dedication to the profession was worth emulation. 
Her life was a model for all of us to follow. Honesty, sincerity, and straightforwardness were the gems, which she had aplenty. 
Her sweet smile bestowed life and ignited candles of hope in the darkness of despondency in many lives. — Prof Dr Mohammad Hafizullah
