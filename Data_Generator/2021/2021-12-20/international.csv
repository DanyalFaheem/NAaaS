0,"Philippines typhoon leaves 100 dead, 300,000 homeless",Pope Francis expressed hopes for  “concrete aid” to be offered to the Catholic-majority country.,"MANILA: At least 109 people have been killed in the strongest typhoon to hit the Philippines this year, official tallies showed on Sunday, as efforts to deliver water and food to devastated islands ramped up.
More than 300,000 people fled their homes and beachfront resorts as Typhoon Rai ravaged the southern and central regions of the archipelago.
The storm knocked out communications and electricity in many areas, ripped off roofs, damaged hospitals, toppled concrete power poles and flooded villages.
Arthur Yap, governor of the popular tourist destination Bohol, said on his official Facebook page that mayors on the devastated island had so far reported 73 deaths in their towns.
Ten people also died on the Dinagat Islands, provincial information officer Jeffrey Crisostomo said.
That took the overall number of reported deaths to 109, according to the latest official figures, making it one of the deadliest storms to hit the country in recent years.
But the toll was likely to rise as disaster agencies assessed the full extent of the storm’s aftermath across the vast archipelago.
Rai smashed into the country on Thursday as a super typhoon packing winds of 195 kilometres (120 miles) per hour.
Thousands of military, police, coast guard and fire personnel are being deployed to assist in search and rescue efforts in the worst-affected areas.
Coast guard and naval vessels carrying food, water and medical supplies are being dispatched, while heavy machinery — like backhoes and front-end loaders — are being sent to help clear roads blocked by fallen power poles and trees.
“It’s going to be a long, tough road for people to rebuild and get their lives back on track,” said Alberto Bocanegra, head of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in the Philippines.
The organisation appealed for 20 million Swiss francs ($21.6 million) to fund urgent relief and recovery efforts.
Pope Francis expressed hopes for  “concrete aid” to be offered to the Catholic-majority country.
An aerial survey of damage to parts of Bohol showed  “our people have suffered greatly”, Yap said.
There has also been widespread destruction on Siargao, Dinagat and Mindanao islands, which bore the brunt of Rai when it slammed into the Philippines.
Verified videos showed severe damage in the Siargao town of General Luna, where many surfers and holidaymakers had flocked ahead of Christmas, with buildings missing roofs, wooden structures crushed to pieces, trees stripped of leaves, and piles of debris on the ground.
Tourists were being evacuated from the island on Sunday by plane and boat.
Dinagat Governor Arlene Bag-ao has said the damage to the island’s landscape was  “reminiscent if not worse” than that caused by Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013.
Haiyan, called Yolanda in the Philippines, was the deadliest cyclone on record in the country, leaving more than 7,300 people dead or missing.
“I saw how Typhoon Odette tore the provincial capitol apart, piece by piece,” Dinagat PIO Crisostomo told radio station DZBB, using the local name for Rai.
“Big tables as heavy as a man went flying during the onslaught of the storm,” he said.
In Surigao City, on the northern tip of Mindanao, shattered glass from smashed windows, roofing, power lines and other debris were scattered in the streets.
Tricycle driver Rey Jamile, 57, braved flooded streets and  “flying” sheets of corrugated iron roofing to get his family to safety at a school evacuation centre.

1,"Russia cannot ‘dictate’ to Nato, says Germany","“We have to talk with each other,"" says German Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht.","RUKLA: German Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht on Sunday said Russia cannot  “dictate” to Nato on regional security, as tensions soar between Moscow and Western capitals over the conflict in Ukraine.
She spoke during a visit to Lithuania, which along with its Baltic neighbours Estonia and Latvia is worried about security after Russia deployed tens of thousands of troops near its border with fellow ex-Soviet Ukraine.
“We have to resolve the tense situation we are in now both diplomatically and with credible deterrence,” Lambrecht told reporters.
“We have to talk with each other, which means discussing the proposals that Russia has put forward. That is right and important,” she added at Lithuania’s Rukla military base.
“But it cannot be that Russia dictates to Nato partners how they position themselves.” The trip is Lambrecht’s first since being named defence minister, after new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats formed a coalition government with the Greens and the liberal FDP earlier this month.

2,Hong Kong’s elections under new rules see muted turnout,All candidates have been vetted for their loyalty to China and only 20 of the 90 legislature seats are being directly elected.,"HONG KONG: Turnout was looking muted on Sunday as Hong Kongers cast ballots for city lawmakers under Beijing’s new  “patriots only” rules which drastically reduce the number of directly elected seats and control who can run for office.
It is the first legislature poll under the new political blueprint China imposed on Hong Kong in response to massive and often violent pro-democracy protests two years ago.
All candidates have been vetted for their patriotism and political loyalty to China and only 20 of the 90 legislature seats are being directly elected. The largest chunk of seats — 40 — are being picked by a committee of 1,500 staunch Beijing loyalists.
The remaining 30 are chosen by reliably pro-Beijing committees that represent special-interest and industry groups. Polling stations closed at 10:30pm after 14 hours of voting.
The latest figures released by authorities showed only about 1.3 million people — 29 percent of the electorate — had cast their votes by 9:30pm. In 2016, 53 percent had cast votes by the same point.
Final turnout figures are expected in the coming hours and counting the ballots will go into the night.
‘Genuine suffrage’
As Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam arrived to cast her vote on Sunday morning, three protesters from the pro-democracy League of Social Democrats party chanted:  “I want genuine universal suffrage”.
“(Lam) said this was an improvement of the electoral system, but in reality, it stripped Hong Kongers of their right to vote,” activist Chan Po-ying told reporters.
The government bought up newspaper front pages and billboards, sent flyers to every household, pinged mobile phones with reminders to vote and made public transport free for the day. Senior Chinese officials also called for Hong Kongers to vote.
But the publicity blitz and appeals appear to have done little to persuade residents in a city where much dissent has been criminalised by a sweeping national security law.
An accountant in her 20s, who gave her name as Loy, said she had no plans to use her ballot.
“My vote won’t mean anything because ultimately it’s Beijing’s people winning,” she said.
But Daniel So, a 65-year-old who works in technology, was among the first queuing at a polling centre in the wealthy Mid-Levels district.
“The young people are not so interested in this election because they are misled by foreign politicians and media,” he said.  “China is doing so great now.” 
Boycott calls
Lam has sought to manage expectations, telling state media last week that a low turnout could indicate  “the government is doing well and its credibility is high”.
Before voting on Sunday she told reporters she  “had not set any target” for turnout.
Independent polling places her public approval rating at around 36 percent.
Multiple Hong Kong media outlets reported Lam would travel to Beijing on Monday, citing sources. Sunday’s election has received vocal backing from Beijing, which sees the new system as a way to root out  “anti-China” elements and restore order in a legislature freed from a disruptive opposition.
Hong Kong chief secretary John Lee said Sunday that those who were excluded from the poll  “are those traitors who will not be acting for the overall good of Hong Kong”.

3,Chile votes in polarised presidential election,SANTIAGO: Chileans headed to the polls on Sunday to vote in the Andean nation’s most divisive presidential ...,"SANTIAGO: Chileans headed to the polls on Sunday to vote in the Andean nation’s most divisive presidential election in decades, with two candidates offering starkly different visions for the future from pensions and privatisation to human rights.
Voters were choosing between Gabriel Boric, a 35-year-old former student protest leader allied to the Communist Party, and ultra-conservative Jose Antonio Kast, a law-and-order candidate and defender of former dictator Augusto Pinochet. “I want real change,” said Lucrecia Cornejo, 72, a seamstress while waiting in line to vote for Boric, the candidate for a broad leftist front. She cited inequalities in education, pensions and health that Boric has pledged to fix.
“I want equality, for us not to be as they call us the ‘broken ones’, more fairness in education, health and salaries.”  Kast, who has been likened to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and who has become an icon for Chile’s  “unapologetic right”, said in an open letter on Saturday that  “two models for the nation are going face-to-face”. He offered  “change with order and stability”.
Both candidates come from outside the centrist political mainstream that has largely ruled since Chile returned to democracy in 1990 following the years of Pinochet’s military dictatorship. The final opinion polls ahead of the run-off election showed Boric widening his lead against Kast, though most polls show a close race. Polling stations close at 6pm and initial results are expected soon after.
Both candidates got under 30pc of the vote in a fragmented first round vote in November and have been battling hard since then to win over sometimes sceptical moderate voters in the Chile, which is the world’s largest copper producer and has a population of some 19 million.
“It is not that I am 100pc with Boric, but now it is time to decide between two opposing options and Boric is my choice,” said Javier Morales, 29, a construction worker.

4,Thousands of Sudanese protest against junta chief in Khartoum,"“The people want the downfall of Burhan,” protesters shouted as additional security forces were deployed to surround the crowd.","KHARTOUM: Tens of thousands of Sudanese protesters rallied on Sunday for a civilian-led transition to democracy, three years since the start of mass demonstrations that led to the ouster of veteran strongman Omar al-Bashir.
Security forces fired tear gas canisters — leaving several wounded, witnesses said — as activists at the presidential palace in Khartoum chanted slogans against military chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who led a coup on Oct 25.
“The people want the downfall of Burhan,” the protesters shouted as additional security forces were deployed to surround the swelling crowd.
Sudan’s generals in the post-Bashir transition government launched their coup almost two months ago and held civilian leader Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok under effective house arrest for weeks but reinstated him on Nov 21.
The move alienated many of Hamdok’s pro-democracy supporters, who dismissed it as providing a cloak of legitimacy for Burhan’s coup.
“Any coup, even after the reinstatement of Hamdok, is unacceptable,” a protester aged in his twenties said as thousands waving Sudanese flags marched past him.
“Our glorious December revolution is seeking civil institutions, not particular individuals.”
Hamdok, who has argued he wants to avoid further bloodshed, warned of  “the country’s slide toward the abyss,” urging restraint from the protesters.
“We’re facing today a sizeable regression in the path of our revolution that threatens the security of the nation, its unity and its stability,” the premier said.
Protest organisers have however vowed, in a key slogan, that they want  “no negotiation, no partnership and no legitimacy” for the current leadership.
Another demonstrator, in his early thirties and also draped in a Sudanese flag, said  “I came out today in complete refusal of the political agreement!  “This deal doesn’t represent the people. We have one demand and that’s a civilian government, not one that ends up being under military control.” Previous protests against the military takeover have been forcibly dispersed.
Nationwide, at least 45 people have been killed and scores more wounded, according to the independent Doctors’ Committee.
On Sunday, authorities shut off bridges linking the capital with its twin city Omdurman, but large crowds still gathered. “The numbers are huge and security forces can’t control them,” said one man who witnessed the protests in Omdurman.

The UAE, which is made up of seven emirates, is considered one of the more liberal countries in the Gulf region, where movies with adult content are routinely cut or edited. 
The wealthy federation has been continuously amending its laws in recent years, presenting itself as a modernising force in a largely conservative region. 
The country’s Media Regulatory Office said on Twitter that it had introduced a 21+ age category to its motion picture content rating system. 
“According to this classification, the international version of movies will be shown in cinemas, with an emphasis on the strict following of age classification standards for audience entry,” it added. 
Late last year, the UAE revamped an array of laws in a social liberalisation drive designed to burnish its progressive brand. 
These included lifting a ban on unmarried couples living together, loosening restrictions on alcohol and offering long-term residencies. 
Earlier this month, the UAE announced it will move to a Western-style Saturday-Sunday weekend, in what experts said was an attempt to maintain its edge over rising regional competitors. 
Starting on January 1, the Emirates will become the only Gulf country not to observe weekends on a Friday and Saturday. 
Foreigners in the UAE make up 90 per cent of the 10-million population.

6,Man lynched for attempted ‘sacrilege’ at Golden Temple,"The slain man tried to grab a sword kept in front of the Guru Granth Sahib, according to NDTV","NEW DELHI: A man was beaten to death in India for allegedly trying to commit an act of sacrilege at the Golden Temple, the holiest shrine of the Sikh faith. 
Local media reported that the unidentified man jumped over a railing into the temple’s inner sanctum during Saturday evening prayers in the northern city of Amritsar. 
Broadcaster NDTV said the man tried to grab a sword kept in front of the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh 
holy book, when he was stopped by worshippers and later beaten to death. 
“The man, about 20 to 25 years of age, had a yellow cloth tied on his head and jumped the fence... the people inside held him and escorted him out to the corridor where there was a violent altercation and he died,” Parminder Singh Bandal, deputy commissioner of Amritsar police, told the channel. 
Punjab state chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi condemned the man’s “most unfortunate and heinous act” in a series of tweets from his office late on Saturday. 

The slain man tried to grab a sword kept in front of the Guru Granth Sahib, according to NDTV

Channi also ordered a probe to find out the “underlying motive and real conspirators behind the dastardly act”.  Defence of the Guru Granth Sahib and Sikh shrines against desecration is a highly sensitive issue for the community. 
Former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards in 1984 after she ordered a brutal army assault on the Golden Temple to flush out separatists. 
Her killing sparked a bloody pogrom in the capital New Delhi which left nearly 3,000 Sikhs dead. 
In 2015, a controversial biopic of Sikhism’s founder Guru Nanak 
was pulled after protests prompted by his depiction in human form, which is against the tenets of the religion. 
And a group of Nihang — a warrior order within the Sikh faith — tortured and killed a man on the outskirts of New Delhi in October after accusing him of desecrating the holy book.

7,France to make it easier for citizens to take mother’s family name,"PARIS: France will make it easier for citizens to take their mother’s name once they are adults, Justice Minister...","PARIS: France will make it easier for citizens to take their mother’s name once they are adults, Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti said on Sunday.
He said the government would support a bill proposed by ruling LREM party lawmaker Patrick Vignal to allow children, when they turn 18, to easily change their family name through a simple procedure at the local town hall.
French citizens will be free to keep their father’s family name, take their mother’s family name or take both in whichever order they wish.
It is already possible for French citizens to change their family name, but it is a long and difficult procedure that requires them to prove to the justice ministry a legitimate reason for doing so.
“Nobody should have to reveal their intimate reasons for changing their name to the state,” Dupond-Moretti said on his Twitter account. The law will be voted on in coming weeks.
In an interview with Elle magazine, Dupond-Moretti said the new legislation will make it easier to change the family name of citizens raised by single mothers or by two fathers or two mothers.
“It will be a law that will favour equality between parents and freedom for all French people,” Dupond-Moretti told Elle.
The legislation would also be a solution for people wishing to change their family name after traumatic situations such as incest, or violence by a father against the mother of his children, he said.

8,UN envoy criticises closure of Rohingya schools at BD camps,DHAKA: The decision by Bangladesh to close schools for Rohingya refugees risks leaving a generation of children...,"DHAKA: The decision by Bangladesh to close schools for Rohingya refugees risks leaving a generation of children “practically uneducated”, a United Nations human rights envoy warned on Sunday. 
Authorities this week ordered the closure of “unauthorised” education centres in border camps hosting around 850,000 members of the stateless Muslim minority, who fled there from violent persecution in neighbouring Myanmar. 
The order came during a visit by UN special rapporteur Tom Andrews, who said the privately run schools played a critical role in educating Rohingya children. 
“I am deeply concerned to have learned of a new policy, promulgated while I was here, that would close all private schools in the camps,” he told reporters in the capital Dhaka. 
“We cannot allow an entire generation of Rohingya to go practically uneducated,” he added. 
Bangladesh’s foreign ministry has said the order will not impact around 3,000 learning centres for children in camps supported by the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef). 
It claimed the move had been made to halt the operations of schools “promoting radicalism and engaged in illegal activities”. 
Angered Rohingya activists in the camps have taken to social media to protest the decision in lieu of public protests, which have become difficult since security was boosted after the murder of a top camp leader in September. 
The New York-based Human Rights Watch said about 30,000 children will lose their access to education if Bangladesh does not reverse the closures. 
Andrews used his Dhaka press conference to urge Bangladesh to protect Rohingya livelihoods after the bulldozing last week of around 1,000 shops in the camps, which authorities said were built illegally.

9,Key US Senator delivers blow to Biden’s social spending bill,WASHINGTON: US Senator Joe Manchin dealt what seemed to be a fatal blow on Sunday to President Joe Biden’s massive...,"WASHINGTON: US Senator Joe Manchin dealt what seemed to be a fatal blow on Sunday to President Joe Biden’s massive social spending bill, saying he could not support the legislation’s passage through the divided chamber.
The moderate Democrat’s vote is crucial to getting the $1.75 trillion Build Back Better bill through the Senate, and Biden — along with other senior Democrats — has spent weeks trying to secure his support.
“I can’t vote for it and I cannot vote to continue with this piece of legislation. I just can’t,” Manchin, a senator from the predominantly Republican state of West Virginia, said on Fox News.
“I’ve tried everything humanly possible, I can’t get there... This is a no.” Biden has held numerous talks with Manchin, who considers the project to be too expensive and argues it will further fuel inflation, now a major concern for Biden and US consumers.
“My Democratic colleagues in Washington are determined to dramatically reshape our society in a way that leaves our country even more vulnerable to the threats we face,” Manchin said in a statement posted on Twitter.
“I cannot take that risk with a staggering debt of more than $29 trillion and inflation taxes that are real and harmful to every hard-working American.” The bill aims to funnel funds toward lowering the cost of child care and prescription drugs, supporting the purchasing power of households and investing in the transition to clean energy.
Manchin’s decision is a major blow to Biden, who has spent significant political capital in seeking to secure the passage of what is seen as a signature bill of his presidency.
Republicans in the divided Senate solidly oppose the legislation, meaning passage depends on every Democrat in the chamber supporting it.
Biden on Thursday admitted he probably wouldn’t be able to push through the bill as quickly as he had hoped after recent tough talks with Manchin, dashing hopes of a definitive vote before the end of the year.
He maintained a note of optimism, however, saying,  “I believe that we will bridge our differences and advance the Build Back Better plan, even in the face of fierce Republican opposition.” The White House did not immediately respond to request for comment on Sunday.
Progressive Senator Bernie Sanders took a harder line responding to Manchin’s  “no” on Sunday, saying Democrats would take the bill to a vote despite his intransigence.
“I hope that we will bring a strong bill to the floor of the Senate as soon as we can and let Mr Manchin explain to the people of West Virginia why he doesn’t have the guts to stand up to powerful special interests,” he said on CNN.
The progressive wing of the Democratic party has been angered at the attention the White House has lavished on the moderate Manchin to win him over to backing the bill.

10,"UN, US lawmakers back efforts to prevent Afghanistan’s economic meltdown","“The need for liquidity and stabilisation of the banking system is now urgent,"" says a UN official at OIC conference.","UNITED NATIONS: The United Nations joined Pakistan on Sunday in appealing to the world to help prevent Afghanistan’s economic collapse as 39 US lawmakers also backed the call.
In a message to the 17th Extraordinary Session of the OIC foreign ministers, Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs Martin Griffiths reminded the world that “now is the time” to save Afghanistan from a total collapse.
“The need for liquidity and stabilisation of the banking system is now urgent – not only to save the lives of the Afghan people but also to enable humanitarian organisations to respond,” he said.
In Washington, 30 lawmakers put their signatures to a letter to US secretaries of state and treasury on Saturday, asking them to help rebuild Afghanistan’s failing economy and to unfreeze the country’s assets.
The letter includes four proposals: Releasing frozen Afghan assets of more than $9 billion to an appropriate UN agency, expanding sanction exemptions for international organisations dealing with Afghanistan, assisting multilateral organisations to pay salaries of essential workers, and allowing international financial institutions to “inject the necessary economic capital into Afghanistan to stave off the economic meltdown”.
In his virtual message, Mr Griffiths warned that Afghanistan’s economy was in “free fall” and if decisive and compassionate action was not taken immediately, it may “pull the entire population with it.”
The message depicted a grim picture of the current situation in Afghanistan: 23 million people facing hunger; malnourished children overflowing in health facilities; 70 percent of teachers working without salaries; and millions of students out of school.
Mr Griffiths warned that the plummeting value of the Afghani currency, a lack of confidence in the financial sector, ever-decreasing trade and the narrowing space for borrowing and investment had further complicated the situation.
The UN official welcomed the decision by the World Bank’s Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund to transfer $280 million by the end of December to the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the World Food Programme (WFP).
“This step should be followed by reprogramming of the whole fund to support the Afghan people this winter,” he said. “Families simply do not have the cash for everyday transactions, while prices for key commodities continue to rise.”
In Washington, Pakistan’s ambassador Asad Majeed Khan also urged the international community to understand the seriousness of the situation.
“We are deeply concerned over the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation in Afghanistan that threatens millions of Afghans with hunger, disease and death,” he said.
He said that Pakistan convened the OIC conference to demonstrate the Islamic world’s solidarity with the Afghan people and to “mobilise international support for a coordinated global response to prevent the unfolding humanitarian catastrophe in Afghanistan.”
At the UN, Mr Griffiths warned that within a year, “30 percent of Afghanistan’s gross domestic product could be lost altogether, while male unemployment may double to 29 per cent. He said that in 2022, the UN would launch its largest-ever funding appeal of $4.5 billion “to help the most vulnerable in Afghanistan”.
The plan is a stopgap measure for over 21 million people who need life saving assistance and must be funded as “a matter of priority,” he said.

11,Spain’s Catholic Church faces abuse probe,The investigation will look into allegations of abuse against 251 priests and some lay people from religious institutions.,"MADRID: Spain’s Catholic Church is to open an investigation into alleged sex abuse of hundreds of children by members of the clergy dating back 80 years that the newspaper El Pais has uncovered, the daily said on Sunday.
The investigation will look into allegations of abuse against 251 priests and some lay people from religious institutions that the paper has uncovered, El Pais said.
The paper has not published in full its findings from a three-year investigation it conducted into the issue, but said its correspondent gave a 385-page dossier to Pope Francis on Dec 2 while the papal entourage and journalists were flying from Rome to Cyprus.
The number of victims is at least 1,237 but could rise into the thousands, the paper said. The allegations concern 31 religious orders and 31 of the country’s some 70 dioceses. The oldest case dates back to 1942 and the most recent to 2018.
The investigation will be carried out by the Spanish Bishops Conference, which is headed by Cardinal Juan Jose Omella, the archbishop of Barcelona, according to El Pais.
Officials from the bishops conference were not available for comment on Sunday.
Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said in a statement that the pope received the documentation and passed it on to the  “competent bodies so it could proceed according to current Church law”.
This was an apparent reference to the Spanish Bishops Conference and to the Vatican’s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which investigates sexual abuse.
Under current Church law the Spanish bishops would have to inform civil authorities about suspected cases of abuse.
In November Pope Francis, who has met with dozens of victims of abuse, thanked journalists for helping to uncover clerical sexual abuse scandals.

12,"Floods in Malaysia displace over 30,000","Downpours since Friday have caused rivers to overflow, submerging many urban areas and cutting off major roads.","KUALA LUMPUR: More than 30,000 people were evacuated from their homes in Malaysia on Sunday as the country battles some of its worst flooding in years.
The tropical Southeast Asian nation often sees stormy monsoon seasons towards the end of the year, with flooding regularly prompting mass evacuations.
Downpours since Friday have caused rivers to overflow, submerging many urban areas and cutting off major roads, leaving thousands of motorists stranded.
More than 30,000 flood victims across eight states and territories were recorded on an official government website, with over 14,000 of them in the central state of Pahang.
Nearly 10,000 people fled their homes in the country’s richest state of Selangor — which surrounds the capital Kuala Lumpur — with Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob expressing surprise at the severe flooding there.
“The amount of rain that fell in Selangor yesterday, what fell in one day would usually fall in one month,” he told a Sunday press conference.
The premier promised swift aid for the flood victims and initial funding of 100 million ringgit ($23.7 million) to repair damaged houses and infrastructure.
A government website showed water exceeding dangerous levels in six central and northeastern states Sunday afternoon.
As floodwaters receded from the capital, business owners went back to their shops to clean up the damage left by the downpours.
Lee Joon Kee, the owner of a tourist information centre and souvenir shop, said he had only reopened a few days ago after closing for nearly two years due to coronavirus restrictions.
“It’s very sad but we have no choice. The only choice (we have is) to move on and clean out the mess, then we will continue our new chapter.” Dozens of bus routes in and around the capital have been suspended along with train services to the port city of Klang.
Operations at three water treatment plants in Selangor were also disrupted, with taps expected to run dry for tens of thousands of people in parts of the state as well as the capital.
Malaysia’s worst flooding in decades took place in 2014, forcing about 118,000 people to flee their homes.
