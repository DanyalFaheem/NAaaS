1,"MQM-P, Hyderabad business community reject new LG law",Joint declaration issued at ‘Shehri Conference’,"HYDERABAD: A joint declaration adopted at the ‘Shehri Conference’ by the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) Hyderabad chapter and the local business community here on Sunday rejected the Local Bodies Amendment Bill 2021, saying that the amendments made to the 2013 law were directly in conflict with the Article 140-A of the Constitution. It termed the new law ‘insult to democracy’, ‘anti-people’ and ‘anti-Sindh’, and called for its repeal.
The conference titled Sindh ka baldiyati kala qanoon 2021 aur shehri masail was held at a banquet and was attended by representatives of the business community of Hyderabad, Latifabad and Qasimabad. It was chaired by MQM-P deputy convener and former Hyderabad district nazim Kanwar Naveed Jamil. 
The declaration said that Pakistan Peoples Party’s biased governance had been a source of unrest and disappointment to people over the past 50 years. It led to a sense of alienation, which is bound to deepen after the enactment. The 2013 law is reflective of PPP’s political mala fide intention and concentration of powers that has led to political, economic and administration decay in districts of Sindh.
It called for introduction of the local government system enshrined under the Article 140-A that called for political, administrative and financial responsibilities for local bodies. It demanded formation of a committee comprising representatives of all political parties to draft recommendations for a new local bodies act to be forwarded to the Sindh Assembly. The new law should be in line with fundamental rights of people and reflective of their aspirations.

Joint declaration issued at ‘Shehri Conference’ 

The declaration said that local bodies/governments should politically, financially and administratively empowered. Provinces should distribute resources under the ‘provincial finance commission’ on the pattern of the National Finance Commission Award. It resolved to continue legal and constitutional struggle for rural and urban population till a true and empowered local bodies system was enforced.
Hyderabad Chamber of Small Traders and Small Industries president Altaf Memon noted that the fresh amendments to the LG law caused anguish among political parties. 
He urged Sindh government to take political parties, trade bodies, members of civil society and other stakeholders into confidence on the new law. This law should not be enforced as long as all stakeholders approved it.
Hyderabad Site Association of Trade and Industry chairman Saman Mal said infrastructure of 300 industries in the SITE area had crumbled as buffalo pens, encroachments and broken roads dotted the landscape. He said the market committee fee was recovered from industrialists but no facilities were provided.
He said that only one provincial minister, Mohammad Ali Malkani, had done something for industrialists though four ministers had held this portfolio. He said the Muttahida MPA, Nadeem Siddiqui, a businessman, effectively represented them in the assembly. He said industrialists would support the party’s voice on this issue.
Qasimabad Business Forum chairman Rahmatullah Saand said traders of this taluka would support their counterparts from other areas. He said Kanwar Naveed Jamil had executed an unprecedented development works in Qasimabad as the district nazim. He said everyone was disappointed to see the present state of Rani Bagh, which was developed by Mr Jamil by spending millions of rupees. 
Anjuman Tajiran Phulelli Bazaar leader Masroor Anwar Butt said education and health facilities in cities had been destroyed during the PPP rule over the province. He said people of Hyderabad had been denied jobs, local government facilities had been snatched and streets had become ponds of sewage.
MNA Sabir Kaimkhani presented an eight-point agenda of conference. He said the LG law 2001 was exemplary. He said PPP was out to centralise powers so much so that people had started describing chief minister as ‘chief mayor’. He said his party did not talk about a division of the province, but it was PPP that had divided it on rural and urban grounds.
Kanwar Naveed Jamil accused PPP of trying to conquer people of urban centres in Sindh because it could not win from there. He said PPP’s approach towards these cities was in no way Sindh- and Pakistan-friendly. He said seeking rights for Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, Mir­purkhas and Nawabshah had been made an offence.  
He said that Karachi contributed 96pc of Sindh’s revenues and 70pc of federal taxes. 
He said Muttahida’s petition on the implementation of Article 140-A had been pending before the judiciary for five years now. “If our stance is wrong, then the petition be decided against us,” he said, adding that his party’s petition on census had also been pending since 2016. “Where should we go now?”, he asked.
Several other speakers, including Faizan Illahi, Doulatram Lohano, Hissam Baig, Mohammad Arif, Seth Goharullah, Gulshan Illahi, Arif Madni, Javed Iqbal and Yaqoob Sheikh also spoke.

Baloch remembered on 104th birth anniversary,HYDERABAD: Speakers at a programme held here on Sunday to mark 104th birth anniversary of renowned scholar of...,"HYDERABAD: Speakers at a programme held here on Sunday to mark 104th birth anniversary of renowned scholar of international repute Dr N.A. Baloch acknowledged that he had completed his tasks of producing multidimensional literary stuff through research. They said that his works could not be matched with any other scholar’s contribution.
At the programme titled ‘Dr N.A. Baloch national seminar’, three books were also launched. It was organised by the Dr N.A. Baloch Foundation in collaboration with the Sindhi Language Authority (SLA) and the Endowment Fund Trust for Preservation of Heritage of Sindh.
Former civil servant Abdul Ghaffar Soomro, who presided over the seminar, said Dr Baloch was a great researcher. His works are of international level which have been published in different languages in Pakistan and India. 
Criticising A book of conquest published in US, Mr Soomro said it carried incorrect references, presented in a dramatic way, thus it should be rejected. He said this book was actually a research work by Manan Asif Ahmed on fatahnama Sindh authored by Ali Kufi which was edited by Dr Baloch.
He said that books like Islamic Civilisation by Dr Baloch was published unauthorisedly in India in 2006 by the Kitab Bhavan, Delhi. 
Dr Baloch had spent most part of his life in ‘old campus’ whose building had not become property of Sindh University (SU) till 2009 as per record, said Mr Soomro, adding that the campus building was given on lease by the Evacuee Trust Property Board alone. He said he as the federal secretary religious minorities got this building entered in the SU record under judicial order. 
Mr Soomro said that soon the Model School working within this building would be restored to its original shape as a heritage property.
SLA chairman Dr Mohammad Ali Manjhi said his institution was founded in 1990. Dr Baloch was appointed its founding chairman. We started out work in a small space of Sindh Museum. He said Dr Baloch’s works preserved in his files still guided SLA, researchers and scholars
Dr Manjhi termed Dr Baloch’s work on lexicon, Latifyat, history and literature ‘unparalleled’. He said his entire work was a resource material for future generation.
Dr Arif Noshahi, a scholar from Rawalpindi, said that Dr Baloch’s research-based work was just exemplary. He wondered how he produced this work amid a lack or limited resources. He said that Dr Baloch was a scholar of international repute and had command over many languages.
Dr Anwar Ahmed, a scholar from Multan, said the Seraiki language was not welcomed in [most parts of] Punjab, pointing out that the first PhD in Seraiki had remained pending with Punjab University for six years because the examiner himself was a non-PhD. He said it was on his request that Dr Baloch from Sindh was nominated as examiner. “I brought him to the Punjab University on a motorbike from railway station. He didn’t object as he was not arrogant,” said Dr Ahmed. “Men like Dr Baloch are born in centuries,” he added.
Karachi University’s Sindhi department teacher Dr Sher Mehranwi said Dr Baloch produced work on Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai between 1966 and 1999. “He got Shah Jo Risalo compiled in ten volumes. He also produced research work on Bhitai’s life,” said Dr Mehranwi.
Rashid Sheikh, who had written on Dr N.A. Baloch, told the audience that the late scholar had contributed multidimensional literary works single handedly which should have been done by institutions. 
Shamsul Haq Memon said that the EFT in collaboration with Dr N.A. Baloch Foundation had published 20 books and three of them, Sindh ja tareekhi maag, Makan aaeen tareekhi librariyon and Great books of Islamic civilisation were being launched today.

4,JI’s Karachi power show declares Sindh local govt bill ‘black law’,Large number of people turn up to express their “anger against PPP government and its policies”.,"KARACHI: The Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) on Sunday announced that it would protest against the recently passed Sindh Local Govern­ment Amendment Bill 2021 and stage a sit-in outside the provincial assembly on Dec 31 in an effort to compel the Pakistan Peoples Party ‘dictatorship’ to reverse the ‘black law’.
The announcement came at a JI rally titled ‘Karachi Bachao March’ staged against the LG bill on M. A. Jinnah Road by the JI Karachi chapter and participated by top JI leadership. A large number of people, including women and children, turned up to express their “anger against PPP government and its policies”.
Addressing the participants, JI chief Sirajul Haq expressed the resolve that a countrywide movement would be launched to build momentum for the rights of Karachi.
He warned that the existing policies of the federal and provincial governments for the country’s business capital would cause suffering to masses and could lead to a national disaster.
“The Karachi is not run by any administration but a mafia,” he said. “Here you will find [water] tanker mafia, land mafia, arms mafia, education mafia, builders mafia, gas and petrol mafia. And every mafia is backed and supported by federal and provincial governments. But we want to make it clear that we wouldn’t tolerate it anymore. This movement would end only after achieving its desired results,” the JI chief declared.
He added that the movement for the rights of Karachi was not for or from the people of this city alone. “Now the people of Karachi will see that their voices and slogans are raised and heard from Badin to Khyber and Kashmir to Gwadar.”
The march has come following a month-long campaign by the Karachi chapter of the JI that demands withdrawal of the recent LG bill calling it against the spirit of Article 140-A of the Constitution.
The party also demands a number of measures for Karachi and its people ranging from status of mega metropolis to infrastructure development and autonomy in local governance to authority of city mayor in law enforcement and revenue generation.
Among several other demands, the party also seeks holding of a ‘true’ census for Karachi, saying that actual population of the metropolis is more that around 30 million.
Riding motorbikes, cars, buses and trucks and carrying placards, banners and party flags, the participants in the rally were calling for an independent and empowered local government system for the city.
“Isn’t it an irony that a city that generates employment for the people of every district and town of the country is never owned by rulers,” said Senator Haq. “Isn’t it a tragedy that this city that deserves to become the world’s centre, is pleading for its due rights from its very own rulers? From General Ayub Khan to the present day rulers, this city has never been given its due rights and share. But enough is enough. This city has always been deprived of its true leadership through rigging, violence and conspiracies. Now we are here to fight the case of this city.”
Earlier, speaking at the rally, JI leader Hafiz Naeem ur Rehman demanded that all civic departments working in the metropolis were placed under the umbrella of one unified system.
“We have made enough appeals,” he said. “We have made enough requests. But the PPP government has proved that it only talks about democracy, but it actually believes in feudalism. But we won’t give up...we will stage a sit-in outside the Sindh Assembly building on Dec 31 in line with our ongoing movement.”

5,Three policemen held for killing passer-by in Mehran Town,"The incident angered the victim’s relatives and area people, who staged a protest outside JPMC.","KARACHI: A passer-by was killed in what police described as an incident of crossfire between armed muggers and police in a Korangi area in the small hours of Sunday morning.
However, the victim’s family staged a protest demonstration and submitted an application seeking registration of a murder case against police for allegedly killing 32-year-old passer-by, Wasif Riaz, in Mehran Town.
DIG-East Muquddus Haider said that three policemen were arrested after an FIR was lodged against them on the complaint of the victim’s family.
Giving details of the incident, he said a police patrol signalled some motorcyclists to stop in Mehran Town within the remit of the Sharafi Goth police station. However, they allegedly resorted to firing and during an exchange of gunfire passer-by Riaz suffered multiple bullet wound and died, he said.
The DIG said the suspects, however, abandoned their motorbike and escaped. The bike was recovered by the policemen and it was snatched from the Landhi area around one month ago, he said.
The body was shifted to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, where Additional Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said that the doctors were not allowed to conduct a post-mortem  examination. Only external examination of the body was conducted, which  revealed only the entry and exit of one bullet.She said the police brought the body to the mortuary around 4.30am.
The incident angered victim’s relatives and area people, who staged a protest outside the JPMC, which was also joined by an MNA of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf.
He said that two FIRs — one against the police and the other relating to the encounter with muggers — of the case were registered.

6,Move from Centre to set up city air quality monitoring stations in Karachi,SAPM on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam says initially 10 air quality monitoring centres are needed in the city.,"KARACHI: Amid growing challenge of pollution, the federal government has hinted at playing its role for gathering and maintaining Karachi’s air quality data, as the city despite being the business capital of the country relies on findings of a foreign station because two such facilities of the Sindh government are non-functional for the past several years, officials and sources said on Sunday. 
A top official told Dawn that the federal government was already helping the Punjab government and a project in cooperation with the World Bank was under way for setting up air quality monitoring centres in Lahore from where authorities and environmentalists would be helped to suggest and devise measures relying on large scale and authentic data. 
“We need same kind of centres in Karachi,” Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam told Dawn. “We will design a broad-based strategy and definitely being a federal organisation, we will also define the role of the Met office in this particular area.” 

Two Sepa facilities have been lying non-functional for years; city relies on data provided by US consulate

He said initially 10 air quality monitoring centres were needed to be set up in Karachi. “In Punjab, there’s a project going on with the World Bank’s cooperation and we believe we would soon be able to sort out things for Karachi as well. The prime minister has recently discussed different proposals and he is clear about the greener and safer air policy.” 
Mr Aslam agreed that accurate data was crucial to take up the challenge of climate change and being the commercial capital and revenue engine of the country, Karachi should have its own proper system for monitoring of air quality to discourage speculations and misinformation that often lead to fake news. 
Two most polluted cities in world
The climate and environment activists believe that air quality monitoring centres are crucial while keeping in view the growing challenge of global warming. 
They express their wonder over non-existence of proper air quality monitoring stations in Karachi when the city quite often is ranked among the most polluted cities of the world due to its poor air quality. 
Only last month, Lahore and Karachi were ranked third and fourth, respectively, on the list of the world’s most polluted cities. 
They claim that the city’s only source of gathering air quality data is the US consulate’s monitors, which measure airborne fine particulate matter only around their premises.
The airborne fine particulate matter is commonly referred to as PM 2.5 because the particulates are less than or equal to 2.5 microns in diameter. 
The two centres of the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (Spea) are lying non-functional for the past many years. However, the issue has pushed the Sindh government to take some immediate measures. 
In a latest development, Sindh Local Government Minister Syed Nasir Shah had sought a comprehensive report on the feasibility of using modern air quality monitoring system to improve the atmosphere of the cities.
“Data from a single monitoring station cannot be applied to an entire city,” said Owais Haider, climate enthusiast and one of the founders of PakWeather, a private weather forecasting and broadcasting entity working for the past more than 20 years with its own countrywide weather stations. 
“But unfortunately we don’t have any system at the government level which can help us collect this crucial data [air quality]. This data is crucial because we can gauge the challenge, weighs the approaching situation and devise a strategy at state level,” he said.
“We from our platform are also trying to expand our operations on these lines but it’s a huge job, which requires so much resources and investment. It should be carried out at government level on a war footing,” he said.

Addressing a protest demonstration in Korangi against the PPP government and its recently passed Sindh Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2021, PSP chairman Syed Mustafa Kamal said the people were fast losing their cool and patience. 
“I will stop listening to you [state institutions] if the PPP government is not stopped from further oppression,” he said. “Don’t make phone calls then by saying Mustafa Bhai what you have done.”
“We are loyal to the state, not to the PPP government. PPP is pushing the people of Karachi against the wall. Today only Korangi is protesting. If we call entire Karachi then we will not call off the protest without getting our rights,” he said.
Carrying placards inscribed with demands and party flags, a number of PSP workers and supporters from district Korangi participated in the demonstration. Senior leaders including party president Anis Kaimkhani were also present.
He said his party did not accept the LG system of 2013 and 2021. “We want the authority from the chief minister. We want more powers for Karachi by further amending the LG law of 2001,” he said.
Mr Kamal termed the PPP government in Sindh “a democratic terrorist” and alleged that the ruling party was spreading hatred and ethnicity in the province.
“This is the first government of its kind which is making tomorrow’s terrorists today,” said the former Karachi mayor. 
“The state should stop PPP. If it does not stop the PPP, then tomorrow, I will stand with those whom you will come to arrest and kill. This is not Occupied Kashmir. This is Karachi, which runs Pakistan and contributes 70 per cent of the total revenue to the national kitty,” he said, adding: “But this is unfortunate that this city is begging for its due rights from the provincial and federal government.”

In Karachi, citizens were still trying to recover from the brutal attack of the Indian Air Force that took place on the night of Dec 8-9. There were also those who were performing their duties in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) with the utmost sincerity, but their work environment was increasingly getting dangerous. On Dec 20, 1971 in a statement published in the newspapers of Karachi, the Secretary General of the Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) appealed to the International Red Cross (IRC) in Geneva to ensure protection of the lives of those who belonged to medical profession in East Pakistan.
On the other hand, the authorities on the western side of the country were still trying to put things on the right track. On Dec 22, it was announced that the government of Pakistan had decided to allow importers to offload all cargoes destined for East Pakistani markets at Karachi until further orders. In cases where the importers could not be contacted, the commercial banks which held the shipping documents could act on their behalf in getting the cargo offloaded and settling the claims of the suppliers and shipping companies.
This was the week when the known politician Mumtaz Bhutto was made governor of Sindh in place of Lt Gen Rakhman Gul. In a statement on Dec 23, when Gen Gul relinquished his appointment, the governor-designate of Sindh Mumtaz Bhutto said that curtain had not yet fallen on East Pakistan, and that the eastern wing of the country would soon be liberated from Indian occupation. He was speaking to the media after arriving in the Sindh capital from Rawalpindi. He admitted, “We had not come to a bed of roses. We have not come into the position by force or by trick. The people had elected us for the very purpose of tackling these problems. Therefore it’s a challenge and responsibility we are happy to accept.” As for his duties as governor, Mr Bhutto commented, “One thing I must make absolutely clear: this office I will never treat as my jagir.” 
On Dec 24, the Islamit Jamiat-i-Talaba made an appeal to Governor Bhutto to help the students who migrated from East Pakistan to seek admissions to Karachi’s colleges. There were over 100 engineering students who were first admitted to the NED Engineering College but their admission was cancelled for ‘no valid reason’. The students of medical colleges from the eastern wing, too, were faced with the same problem.
While all of this was going on, the artists in the city of Karachi, in order to come to terms with the unsavoury situation, tried to express their feelings about the negativity surrounding the region in their distinct ways. On Dec 20, Dawn published an image of an artwork made by an eminent painter describing which a report read: “In agony over the loss of innocent lives, Mansur Ahmed Rahi, a well known East Pakistani artist, has recreated on canvas the horrors of the Indian terror bombing. He uses pen and ink to emphasise details of destruction. He does not oversimplify. He retains a direct, linear quality that takes the viewer to the heart of message — the inhuman destruction of [Karachi’s] Bihar Colony by heavy Indian bombing.”
