0,Wapda plans medical college in Lahore,LDA amends land conversion rules for charities,"LAHORE: The Wapda Medical College Trust (of Water and Power Development Authority) will soon launch its medical college in Lahore after the Lahore Development Authority has amended rules allowing fee waiver of land conversion for charitable bodies.
The medical college will be established at Wapda Town, phase-II (Abdul Sattar Edhi Road), where the authority has allocated 47-kanals, Dawn has learnt. According to documents, the Wapda Medical College Trust applied to the LDA in 2019 to exempt it from the conversion fee of over Rs54 million. The case, in a meeting held in August 2019, was approved by the scrutiny committee subject to the payment of conversion fee, provision of 30-foot houseline and adequate parking provision on the premises as per LDA Building and Zoning regulations.
However, the project owner (Wapda) applied for installments, which was also approved in November 2019, allowing the applicant to pay the fee in eight equal installments of over Rs6.8 million (each). The Wapda trust could not do that too.
In June, this year, Wapda again sought more time to deposit the conversion fee till the final decision of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) where the Wapda’s application for registration of its trust as charitable organization was in process. However, the LDA declined the application as there is no such provision in LDA land use rules 2020.

LDA amends land conversion rules for charities

Later in August, Wapda submitted an application along with its trust registration certificate issued by the FBR and requested the LDA to waive of the conversion fee.
Keeping in view the compliance of FATF-related laws and similar applications of the other charitable /non-profit organizations in future, the authority finally decided to amend LDA land use regulations 2020.
“Consequently, the authority added the regulation 23 (Exemption of Fee to Philanthropic / charitable Non-Profit Organization of Chapter-VII of LDA land use regulations 2020 that reads: “23 (c), the Philanthropic, charitable or non-profit organization is registered with the charities commission under home department, Punjab as per section 12 of the Punjab Charities Act 2018,” the document explains while discussing background of the issue. The applicant also submitted an affidavit stating that the organization shall provide services to needy people under its regulations. It may be mentioned that the LDA, under the amended rules, also entertained the similar applications from other organizations, including the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital & Research Centre, and Tehzibul Akhlaq Trust, for establishing New Ali Garh University in Lahore.
The Traffic Engineering and Transport Planning Agency has also been allowed to exempt the charitable organization from paying the scrutiny fee for the issuance of NOC related to parking provisions etc.

1,"Sehat card to be launched in seven divisions next month, says Buzdar","“Every family in Punjab will be having health card facility that will offer treatment cost up to Rs1m per annum,” says CM.","LAHORE: Chief Minister Usman Buzdar has said the government is launching a historic welfare scheme of Naya Pakistan Sehat Card from the next month for seven divisions, while families in Dera Ghazi Khan and Sahiwal divisions have already been given the health card facility.
In a statement issued here on Sunday, the chief minister said in the first phase of the scheme being launched next month, families in Lahore division would be offered the health card facility, followed by the remaining six divisions.
“Every family in Punjab will be having health card facility that will offer treatment cost up to Rs1 million per annum,” the chief minister said.
Mr Buzdar said the initiative was a big step towards ‘Naya Pakistan’ and the completion of another promise made by Prime Minister Imran Khan to the nation.
He said the budget of the health sector was Rs169 billion in the previous government, while the present one made a substantial increase and allocated Rs399bn in this sector.
For the first time in Punjab, he said, such a hefty amount had been allocated for the improvement of the health sector, besides setting up eight mother and child hospitals in the backward districts and Lahore.
He chided the opposition parties for “only doing politics on non-issues” as they had no agenda.
He said there was a chaos in the opposition’s ranks and “rejected elements” and they were just criticising the government to gain political mileage.
He said those levelling “baseless allegations” against the government should first look into their pockets which were soaked in corruption.
He said the politics of those who had ruthlessly looted the country had ended forever and the era of fooling the people with hollow slogans had passed.
Mr Buzdar said the present government had completed those developmental projects which the previous governments could not initiate in years. “No one will be allowed to create hindrance in the way of development,” the chief minister warned.

5,Punjab Notes: Language: An elusive conduit for power struggle – Part I,The trope that reiterates that language gives specific and unique identity to its natural speakers is well-known. ...,"The trope that reiterates that language gives specific and unique identity to its natural speakers is well-known. But one can also assert without fear of contradiction that language is power. It is power per se because it embodies immeasurable potential of human expression and magic of articulation. But it’s also power in another important sense as it is reflected in its being used as a concealed means to negotiate power relations between groups and communities.
In other words, it yields itself to be employed as an instrument that can express both domination and subjugation. Domination as intended in such a phenomenon spans political, economic, social and cultural dimensions albeit in a surreptitious manner.
Subjugation implies being made to accept what is given, the status quo for the weaker ones. The reason is that language comes handy in the process of othering; otherness of an alien linguistic group provides impetus to the hegemonic urge of a predator culture to at least appropriate the other if it’s not able to destroy it. It means destruction through appropriation which involves imposition of a powerful group’s way of life on the one that is powerless. But it is apparently not done for the motive that actually drives it. It is done in the name of things higher; cultural advancement, social cohesion, integration, homogeneity and national unity etc.
Ideals actually are a shell that conceals the kernel. So the politics of language in so many cases reflects that the real nature of conflict between different groups is not merely linguistic. It encapsulates much bigger multi-faceted phenomenon. It hides in its innards the power struggle that expresses itself through other means, the language in the case in question. We find some highly relevant examples not in the distant past which represent power struggle between different groups that appeared couched as if it was a language conflict.
After the colonisation of the subcontinent, the British chose Urdu as their preferred local language. It was language of Uttar Pradesh’s urban centres which was also spoken in the Mughul court along with Persian which was itself a vestige of imperialistic Iranian culture. It was greatly patronised by the ruling elite ensconced in Delhi and Lucknow which largely comprised Muslims of foreign extraction, mostly from Central Asia, Iran and Arabia.
The elite, alienated from the local ethos, despite being a tiny minority enjoyed exclusive privileges as they held the reins of politico-military power. Acting according to the historical dictates of power, the British put to use the cultural tools of power bequeathed by the preceding structure as their choice to promote Urdu as lingua franca of the subcontinent amply showed. They conveniently forgot that no single language could represent the highly diverse Indian linguistic landscape. They started developing project Urdu in the Fort William College in Calcutta (now Kolkata) in the 19th century. We witness a backlash against this hegemonic project by Hindu intelligentsia who spoke a variant of a similar language called Hindi in the last three decades of the same century. It developed into what is known as Urdu-Hindi conflict and peaked in third decade of the 20th century when Urdu partisans urged Muslims, even those who did not speak Urdu, to declare it as their natural language in the census in some parts of North India while Hindi partisans tried in a similar manner to persuade their Hindu community to declare Hindi as their mother language. Advocates of both the groups lied and lied blatantly to hide the real conflict that emanated from the centuries long Muslim rule. It signified renewed power tussle when the playing field under the British became comparatively even between the historically deprived Hindu majority and dominant Muslim minority. The first clearly visible manifestation of the wider power conflict emerged as a language conflict. Both sides to the conflict brushed the fact under the carpet that a language had its roots in the region, not in the faith.
Urdu is not Islamic as Hindi is not Hindu. We come across Urdu speaking Hindus and Hindi speaking Muslims, Jains and Buddhists in India. Both the languages are spoken by diverse faith communities in the land of their birth. The real conflict had its origins in the mutual animus. The language conflict in reality reflected the historical chasm between Muslims and Hindus which both failed to bridge. It was like the classic case of peace being continuation of war through other means.
Language was an emblem borrowed to wage a war for safeguarding the self-interest of the parties concerned.
It is disquietingly interesting to note that though Hindu-Muslim conflict offered a sort of resolution in the emergence of a new Muslim homeland called Pakistan, the language conflict, a form of thinly concealed power struggle, did not come to end. It transformed itself from inter-group conflict into an intra-group one. Previously it was between Hindus and Muslims, now it transmuted into a clash between Bengali and non-Bengali compatriots.
Non-Bengalis though a minority were dominant as they, a motely group from Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and present day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa which was at the forefront of the Pakistan movement in crucial years, came to monopolise power to the exclusion of Bengalis who were the initial vanguard. Here again language was used as a political ploy by West Pakistan’s non-Bengali elite coterie to perpetuate its domination.
Mr. M.A.Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, who knew no indigenous language than his own Gujrati, was ill-advised by his Uttar Pradesh’s immigrant advisers on the matter. He declared emphatically in a political meeting in Dhaka in 1948 that Urdu and only Urdu would be the sole national language of Pakistan which greatly injured the pride of Bengali majority and evoked immediate retaliatory response. Politically conscious Bengalis took it as what it was; a simmering attempt at domination. The independence, they rightly realised, only seemed to have changed masters; the brown landlords and bureaucrats, both civil and military, in place of white Brits. And the former were as alien as the latter if not more. They saw through the political game of sloganeering; national integration as an instrument of subjugation. — soofi01@hotmail.com

Addressing the ceremony, Post Graduate Medical Institute Principal Prof Dr Sardar Muhammad Al-Freed Zafar said the increasing rate of kidney diseases in Pakistan was a matter of grave concern as thousands of precious lives were lost every year due to kidney failures. He said there was need for timely diagnosis, appropriate treatment and awareness among the masses in this regard.
Prof Zafar urged the medical experts to focus on effective strategies and research for prevention of kidney disease as dialysis was not a permanent cure for the patients. He said a quality of the LGH dialysis department, a unique example of humanitarian services, was that during the Covid-19 outbreak work was stopped in various departments of the hospitals but the dialysis unit kept on working as usual.
Prof Khizar Hayat Gondal said since January 2021 till now more than 17,000 dialysis had been done free of cost at the LGH for which the Punjab government provided Rs30m.
LGH MS Dr Amir Ghafoor Mufti said in the private sector a dialysis costs Rs3,000 to Rs4,000 while dialysis were being performed without any charges at the LGH.
Nephrology Department head Dr Yasir Hussain, Dr Shah Jahan, Dr Abdul Aziz and other medics were also present.

The Pakistan government has already set only a few hours for the supply of Sui gas to the citizens during 24 hours.
In the few hours allotted for the gas supply, its pressure is extremely low, making it difficult for women to cook food while students are forced to go to school and colleges without having breakfast.
To counter of the situation, some people have illegally installed gas compressors in their homes to increase gas pressure, which also contribute to low gas pressure in the surrounding houses. Residents of Farooq Ganj, Usmanganj, Mohalla Islampura, Jilani Colony and Mohalla Khawajagan and other areas of the Narowal city have been severely disturbed due to the use of gas compressors.
The citizens, Muhammad Sarfraz and Abrar Mughal, claim that they have complained to the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines (SNGPL) officials about the use of illegal gas compressors several times but they have not been heard yet.
They bemoan that stoves and gas heaters are also running in the houses of only those who are using illegal gas compressors.
In the wake of the gas shortage, the citizens are forced to use LPG and firewood to cook food. But more use of the LPG and wood has increased their prices too.
A cylinder for domestic use is being sold at Rs2,650 as the LPG gas is being sold at the rate of Rs300 per kg through decanting. On the other hand, the prices of firewood have also gone up and it is being sold at Rs900 for 40kg.
The district administration has failed to control the rates of LPG and firewood. Assadullah and Omar Akram even that LPG or woods are not available. “In the new Pakistan, our children are forced to go to school hungry every day,” they say.
The citizens demand Prime Minister Imran Khan and Punjab Chief Minister Sardar Usman Buzdar to take notice of the situation.
SUICIDE: A 36-year-old man committed suicide over unemployment in Shakargarh city.
Muhammad Nawaz, a resident of Mohalla Lalpura in of the city, a labourer by profession, had four children.
He was unemployed for the last three or four months and was suffering from health issues. On Sunday, he committed suicide by putting a rope around his neck.
The Shakargarh City police shifted the body to Tehsil Headquarters Hospital Shakargarh and handed it over to the deceased’s family after a post-mortem.
