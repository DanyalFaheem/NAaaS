0,A double dose of monetary tightening,"Ultra tight monetary policy should make real interest rates positive, promote savings and lead to buildup in domestic investment.","Ignoring calls from the private sector business lobbies for keeping the interest rate intact, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has raised its key policy rate by 100 basis points to 9.75per cent.
The Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FPCCI) had asked the central bank before its Dec 14 monetary policy committee meeting to hold the interest rate. The apex representative body of Pakistan’s private sector feared that any further monetary tightening after the 150bps rate hike announced on Nov 19 would cause “stagflation”. The FPCCI chief, through a press statement, had also questioned the efficacy of monetary policy in controlling inflation arguing that only 7pc of commercial entities in Pakistan actually borrow from banks. 
The SBP says that “together with the natural moderating influence of the flexible and market-oriented exchange rate” the interest rate tightening would help achieve the goal of a sustainable current account deficit this fiscal year.” This statement explains one part of the rationale for a double-dose of monetary tightening. What explains the other part is that the central bank expects inflation to average 9-11pc this fiscal year. 

A higher interest rate plays a role in containing imports by making bank finance for importers costlier — but it also makes banking funds pricier for all businesses and exporters

The recent 100bps increase in policy rate immediately after the 150bps rate hike announced on Nov 19 is obviously meant to keep inflationary pressure bursting through this range. A massive rise in year-on-year consumer inflation to 11.5pc in November from 9.2pc in October had left no room for the central bank to avoid a double dose of monetary tightening. 
But this surge in inflation did not come as a surprise. Inflationary pressures had been building up for months due to rising electricity, gas and fuel prices as well as due to local and imported food inflation. 
The SBP’s September 20 decision to increase its policy rate by just 25 basis points to 7.5pc was a weaker signal to markets about the central bank’s intention of fighting inflation with full force.
A larger increase in policy rate back in September could have sent a stronger signal to markets keeping those inflationary expectations under check which later on peaked and produced additional inflationary pressures.
The 150bps rate-hike announced on November 19 had, thus, become quite necessary because by that time the central bank’s core inflation data sets had also established the tenacity of the inflationary pressures. And now another dose of 100bps policy rate rise also seems appropriate because monetary tightening of a lesser degree could not have sent the right signal to the markets about the seriousness of the SBP to fight inflation. 
The SBP strategy is a natural response to higher than expected inflation (11.5pc in Nov and 9.3pc in five months of this fiscal year against the SBP’s initial estimate of a maximum of 9pc). But as it decelerates the pickup in domestic demand the economy has seen so far, the SBP’s statement that it “would also help achieve the goal of a sustainable current account deficit this fiscal year,” warrants some explanation. 
The current account deficit in July-Nov FY22 soared past $5 billion equaling 4.7pc of GDP against a surplus of $1.3bn equaling 1.4pc of GDP in FY21. The assumption that a dramatic rise in interest rate would bring the deficit to a sustainable level is based on the premise that a higher interest rate would depress the buildup in domestic demand thereby reducing imports that witnessed a meteoric rise in July-Nov FY22. Imports bill of merchandise goods, according to SBP’s balance of payments statement, skyrocketed past $23.48bn in July-Nov FY22 from about $14.12bn.
This pace of increase in imports would surely decelerate in coming months for a host of reasons including a fall in import prices of fuel oils, anticipated slower increase in prices of edible oils that have already peaked and the massive rupee depreciation so far this fiscal year that has sent prices of imported stuff beyond the reach of many consumers. The government’s move to contain imports via tariff and non-tariff barriers being erected around non-essential items may also help. 
A higher interest rate, too, would play a role in containing imports by making bank finance for importers costlier — but it would also make banking funds pricier for all businesses and exporters. This means the momentum in merchandise exports, thanks partly to the post-Covid concessional bank financing and specific fiscal incentives would also be hit. Essentially, then, a 250bps monetary tightening in less than a month (between Nov 19 and Dec 14) would have a somewhat neutral effect on the trade deficit. 
And that, by extension, means it would be of little help in addressing the issue of the current deficit within this fiscal year. In the next fiscal year, too, if the current deficit falls to an extent that our policymakers may view as ‘sustainable’ that would be due to the decline in aggregate demand and slower GDP growth thanks partly to the double dose of monetary tightening.
That is why the PTI government — confronting make-or-break challenges for longevity in power, has accepted the current monetary tightening but does not own it wholeheartedly. And, that is why the private sector businesses continue to decry the move. 
But then, economics is all about making trade-offs. Ultra-loose monetary policy that remained in vogue till Sept 20 this year had rendered real interest rates negative. Ultra tight monetary policy should make real interest rates positive, promote savings and may lead to a much-needed buildup in domestic investment in the medium to long term.

1,Fiscal devolution,Provinces are expected to fully finance provincial nature projects since funds were transferred to them under the 7th NFC shares.,"The government has given an undertaking to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to curtail the federal Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) by Rs200 billion this year besides a Rs50bn cut on special grants in addition to more taxes. The IMF programme entails the sustainability of public investments beyond the current fiscal year amid a serious resource crunch.
That set the centre to look for a permanent financial cushion and find the straitjacket implementation of constitutional and fiscal devolution as one of the solutions. The centre already has an oblique arrangement with the provinces under which it secures Rs250-350bn cash surplus from provinces to finance the fiscal deficit and has indirectly established the fact that the provinces had secured higher than required resources under the 7th National Finance Commission Award 12 years ago.
Its debt servicing costs have since been increasing, particularly in recent years, in addition to overstretched fiscal commitments for some political programmes and it wants to shed that extra load. Three major areas, hence, appear to be in the line of fire. They include centre-provincial projects partly or fully funded out of PSDP, followed by so-called SDG funding and housing projects. 

The ministries of finance and planning have firmed up plans to shift to the federating units the financial burden that now stands at above Rs320bn

To begin with, the ministries of finance and planning have firmed up plans to stop financing provincial development projects, particularly those relating to devolved subjects, to shift to the federating units the financial burden that now stands at above Rs320bn.
The centre has also funded about Rs235bn worth of SDG schemes since 2014-15 including Rs56bn disbursed this year to keep parliamentarians happy.
This is part of a new National Development Framework (NDF) under which the federal government wants to restrict its investment priorities to the areas of federal responsibilities and ensure that the provinces take full fiscal responsibility for all devolved subjects.
After the 18th Amendment in the Constitution and the abolition of the concurrent list, the subjects of about 16 defunct ministries along with development projects were devolved to the respective provinces. Thereafter, the financing of provincial nature projects was the responsibility of the concerned provinces. Funding for such projects was discouraged through the PSDP except for core vertical projects of health and population till 2017. 
Subsequently, the provincial projects have been inserted back into the federal PSDP and captured substantial fiscal space leaving scarce resources for important federal projects. This trend has resulted in thinly spread allocations causing time and cost overrun of projects of national significance. 
In PSDP 2021-22, about 331 projects are provincial in nature, costing Rs1.151 trillion with Rs341bn expenditure and allocation of Rs320bn which the finance and planning divisions believe should ideally be financed by the provincial governments through respective annual development plans (ADP) in the wake of the 18th Amendment and 7th NFC Award.
The portfolio of the Ministry of Housing and Works (MOHW) has increased manifold with the incursion of provincial nature schemes and has adopted characteristics of provincial ADPs. During PSDP formulation, MOHW demanded Rs44.5bn (Rs9.3bn for 58 ongoing projects and Rs35.2bn for 206 new projects) for PSDP 2021-22. In addition, a number of approved projects, as a backlog is also pending funding.
“Moreover, various references have been and are being received from the Prime Minister Office for the financing of provincial nature projects proposed by various quarters through federal PSDP,” records suggest. 
The ministries of finance and planning are resisting the addition or approval of small nature schemes and want these to be avoided. They want these small schemes to be either be financed by the provinces concerned or through the SDGs achievement programme which is tailored to finance such schemes and they have a point.
To contain the incursion of provincial nature projects, the National Economic Council (NEC) in June 2021 approved policy guidelines regarding processing and approval of provincial nature projects for financing from PSDP which had been notified by the planning division in August. The policy inter-alia provides that due to financial constraints and financing of mega projects of national importance by the federal government, it may not be possible to continue financing provincial projects unless costs are shared by the provincial governments, only capital investment in projects located in deprived areas may be considered. 
It further stipulates that provinces bear the cost of land acquisition, resettlement, provincial taxes, cost of project monitoring units and that the provinces take over the projects after completion for sustainable operation and maintenance.
The provinces are thus expected to fully finance provincial nature projects since substantial funds were transferred to the provinces under the 7th NFC shares and onwards. Nevertheless, to supplement the efforts of the provincial governments, the federal government continued to finance the social sector related schemes through Millennium Development Goals /SDGs programme, they argue. From 2014-15 onwards, about Rs233bn have been allocated for the programme to finance small nature schemes falling in various sectors like education, health, sanitation, local roads etc in the provinces.
The two federal ministries want the policy approved by the NEC to be dovetailed with the NDF currently under preparation as guiding principles for the provinces and federal ministries for undertaking the development projects in accordance with assigned Rules of Business and division of subjects after the 18th Amendment.
Depending on the timing and political compulsions of election season nearing, how the plan goes ahead would have to be seen but some suggested guidelines would involve a lot of federal-provincial debate. The plan seeks to ensure that departmental development working parties particularly ministries of water resources and housing and works must not consider or approve the provincial nature projects and SDGs schemes. The provincial schemes under the Finance Division would be reviewed and rationalised over the next few weeks and “in case justified for federal funding, no further allocation beyond approved cost will be provided”.
The provinces would be required not to demand specific shares against the PSDP funds, as a prerogative, since federal PSDP is tailored to NDF focusing on national level projects prepared and approved by the ministries/divisions as per assigned Rules of Business. It is also proposed that in case of projects already being financed through PSDP including Covid-19 related projects etc the provinces would ensure and provide the counterpart funds through respective ADPs before requesting federal funding. The Finance Division will confirm the utilisation certificate of earlier released funds as a pre-requisite.
In case provincial nature projects/schemes are considered for funding, the concerned province should undertake funding at least to the extent of 50 per cent and commit its sustainability through provision for operation and maintenance, revision etc and funds for PSDP would only be released after provincial governments’ display that it has released its due share. 
The Prime Minister’s Office would ensure the policy decision on provincial nature schemes and would refer such schemes proposed by the parliamentarians to the provinces concerned for financing through respective ADPs.

2,A baby step towards universal healthcare,The health story of Pakistan is sad with a high rate of wasting and stunting in children.,"The country has a long way to go before it becomes a welfare state, but Pakistan is said to have taken the first baby step under the PTI rule in the long journey towards providing universal healthcare.
The architects of Sehat Sahulat Scheme claim that it has transformational potential. “Soon, Pakistan will be the first developing nation to achieve universal health coverage,” a doctor in the prime minister’s health team boasted.
Amidst many negatives, independent watchers consider the recent developments in the public health domain reflective of suppressed positive energy and technological transformation underway in Pakistan. Hoping against hope, they pray for the success of the public health insurance scheme for the poor and the ailing. 

While arguments continue in certain quarters, the Sehat Sahulat Scheme largely appears to be a win-win situation for all: the people, the government and the private sector

Fired by the PTI vision and encouraged by the handling of the Covid crisis and the subsequent inoculation drive that earned the country global recognition, the federal health establishment decided to initiate an ambitious health insurance scheme. Capitalising on the digitised database of the National Database Registration Authority (Nadra), drawing on local technological expertise to collate it with other data pools in entities, such as the provincial accounts offices, Federal Board of Revenue, etc, the health team developed market-based health insurance schemes to provide relief to the ailing poor. 
The health story of Pakistan is sad with a high rate of wasting and stunting in children. According to the current Economic Survey, Pakistan is behind others in the region in terms of life expectancy and infant mortality. The country continues to struggle with the crippling poliovirus, a disease that has been long been eradicated globally; Pakistan and Afghanistan being the exceptions. The public health infrastructure is both insufficient and inefficient. Private healthcare is expensive and beyond the reach of many. 
The PTI government has planned to initially offer health insurance to the most vulnerable and gradually extend the cover to anyone and everyone in need. The progress thus far is regionally uneven as health is a provincial subject and each province is free to decide the model, timing and scale of health insurance. 
“We are constantly in touch with the health hierarchy in all the four provinces, nudging them to take the plunge, assuring them of full assistance administratively and technically in the launch and the management of health insurance. They are, however, expected to manage the financials on their own. 
“We believe that each of the four provinces can actually deliver perfectly well within their current health budgets without any support from any external source. There are multiple innovative public health insurance models that weave with private health facilities in a way that serves social objectives and opens up a huge space for private sector growth,” a senior source involved in designing and execution of health scheme, informed Dawn privately.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, ruled by PTI, took a lead when it launched the micro-health insurance scheme in 2020 and started the distribution of Sehat Sahulat Plus cards to the eligible 600,000 families. The federal government also initiated a health card scheme for deserving residents of Islamabad, Thar, Azad Kashmir, tribal regions of KP and Gilgit-Baltistan. Punjab, the other province with a PTI-led government, has also launched the health insurance scheme last week and is expected to start the distribution of health cards early next year. Balochistan, where PTI is at the helm in a coalition, is said to be evaluating options, but Sindh, under a PPP government, appears reluctant.

“Sindh’s public stance on Sehat Sahulat Card is political. It reflects their opposition to the ruling PTI and not to the idea of free access to health facilities for families that can’t afford to tend to their ailing members. The fact that people of KP residing in Sindh are availing the facility of free medical care at empanelled hospitals in the province is bound to mount pressure on the Sindh government to provide similar care for the locals.
“If you ask me, I don’t think a political party will allow its political capital to get eroded. The health hierarchy in Sindh must already be working on its own brand of a health insurance scheme. One shouldn’t be surprised if Sindh also launches one next year,” a health expert working with the federal government asserted over the phone. He is barred from publicly airing his opinion.
A CEO of a semi-charitable hospital in Karachi serving Sahulat Plus cardholders was impressed with the scheme and also with the quality of assistance provided by the State Life Insurance Company (SLIC), a partner in the scheme. “The SLIC staff provides card-holders verifications swiftly, monitor each and every case processed, and get the approval for the treatment we advise. For us, it is a win-win situation as we get to help more people without straining the budget as the government shares the cost,” Dr Danish of Creek General Hospital told Dawn over the phone.
Hafizuddin of SLIC promised to explain the whole model later but provided the list of empanelled hospitals and clinics in Sindh. There are seven second-tier and semi-charitable hospitals of Karachi, one in Hyderabad, and health centres and clinics in Mirpurkhas, Badin, Chachro, Mithi and Umerkot. 
Mehar Khursheed, the media coordinator for the Sindh Health Department, questioned the efficacy of the scheme, which, she asserted, enriches the insurance company as the premium is paid even for those who are not using the facility. She pointed out several other shortcomings that, in her opinion, divert resources from government to private hospitals, hurting more than helping the healthcare system.

3,Monetary hodgepodge amidst economic turmoil,The SBP needs to restore the credibility of its monetary policy statements.,"The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) injected liquidity of Rs1.7 trillion, including Rs689 billion for a rare 63-day period at 9.9 per cent and Rs1.09tn for the usual seven days at 9.82pc, through its open market operations (injection) last week to clear uncertainty about monetary tightening and inspire confidence in the market that it is not going to raise the interest rate at least until March.
The analysts believe that the central bank had conducted the 63-day OMO injection to bring stability to the money market and assure commercial banks that the new monetary tightening cycle, which started with a small bump of 25 basis points in the key policy rate in September followed by 150bps increase in November and 100 bps hike last week, is over at least for the immediate term. 
The issuance of longer-term maturity OMO will reduce the commercial banks’ repricing risk for more than one and a half months, which will help bring down the cut off yields in the next T-bill auction later this month.

The SBP needs to restore the credibility of its monetary policy statements by not creating uncertainty in the markets or surprising them with sudden shifts in its forward guidance

The SBP, like other central banks, often conducts OMO to inject liquidity into or mop up excess money supply from the market to manipulate the interest rates in line with its monetary policy objectives. Normally, the OMOs are for shorter tenors ranging between seven days and 14 days. But last Friday’s OMO injection was the largest maturity cycle ever. The previous high was 17 days back in August 2011, according to Topline Securities.
“This would signal to the market that the central bank is willing to accept a fixed cost for two months, which means that the policy rate will remain unchanged in the near term,” Fahad Rauf, head of research at Ismail Iqbal Securities, says.
“This action has likely come in reaction to higher cut-off yields in the T-bill auctions (held on December 1 and 15) and should bring down rates in the next auction later this month (when the government returns to the market to raise funds amounting to Rs1.2tr),” he continues.
There are two plausible explanations for the much higher-than-usual premium charged by the commercial banks in the last two T-bill auctions. One, the demand and supply factor might be in play as the government has no choice but to look towards the commercial banks for meeting its borrowing needs ever since the International Monetary Fund (IMF) stopped the SBP from financing the budget deficit under its 2019 funding programme.
The other reason of course pertains to the central bank’s November monetary policy decision to suddenly hike the rate by 150bps, ditching its previous forward guidance of ‘gradual and measured’ tapering of monetary stimulus in response to the rising inflation and the widening current account imbalance. 

The bankers were anticipating a further increase in the interest rates in the near term contrary to the assurance given by the SBP

The monetary policy statement in November clearly indicated the continuation of monetary tightening but didn’t revise its inflation projections of 7-9pc and the current account deficit estimates of 2-3pc of GDP or $6bn-9bn for the present financial year. That created uncertainty in the market, especially in the wake of the staff-level agreement with the IMF for the resumption of its $6bn funding programme. The IMF funding is, however, contingent upon the execution of five prior actions that include an increase in taxes, cut in development expenditure, reversal of the Covid-related monetary stimulus and SBP autonomy.
So it wasn’t surprising to see the commercial banks charging big premiums on T-bills on December 1, exploiting both the demand-supply factors as well as interest rate uncertainty. What surprised the market watchers was their response to the central bank’s new forward guidance in its latest monetary policy that tried to clear uncertainty in the market, suggesting that the latest round of monetary tightening was over for the moment after a hike of 100bps in the key policy rate to 9.75pc. 
It said the “end goal of mildly positive real interest rates on a forward-looking basis was now close to being achieved... (and it) expects monetary policy settings to remain broadly unchanged in the near-term.” The SBP also revised upwards its inflation projections to 9pc-11pc and the current account gap to 4pc of GDP.
The bankers also ignored the central bank’s warning in its recent monetary policy statement, terming the rise in the secondary market yields, benchmark rates and cut-off rates across all tenors in the government’s auctions as unwarranted. In spite of these developments, the yields in the last T-bill auction held a day after the announcment of the monetary policy remained flat at the same level from the previous auction while in the secondary markets it went up by 20bps to 30bps.
That implied that the bankers were anticipating a further increase in the interest rates in the near term contrary to the assurance given by the SBP.
Analysts agree that the SBP’s OMO injections will also help the central bank set the direction of interest rates. But, as pointed out by the Topline analysts, the overall economic numbers, especially the Consumer Price Index, current account deficit, foreign exchange reserves along with the timing of the resumption of the IMF programme, will remain the key determinant of the interest rate movement going forward. 
More than that, the SBP needs to restore the credibility of its monetary policy statements by not creating uncertainty in the markets or surprising them with sudden shifts in its ‘forward guidance’.

4,The tale of Benazirabad,Growers believe that citrus cultivation has the potential to replace mango ...,"


 
Orchards, lush green agricultural fields on both sides of Nawabshah-Qazi Ahmed road, blossoming flowers of the mustard crop in patches and a lined portion of Rohri canal offer a breathtaking view on a December morning amid foggy conditions. Welcome to Shaheed Benazirabad district that is showing a trend for citrus cultivation, in addition to major crops and mango orchards, though somewhat slowly. 
It is a district native to the indomitable Zardari family headed by Asif Ali Zardari, who served as the 11th president of Pakistan. Nawabshah was named after a leading figure of Sadaats of Nawabshah, Syed Nawab Shah. Syed Budhal Shah, his son, being a large landowner had donated 60 acres of land to the British government for construction of buildings of district and taluka offices free of cost. After the assassination of South Asia’s iconic politician and first Muslim woman prime minister Benazir Bhutto, its nomenclature was changed from Nawabshah to Benazirabad in her memory. 
Mr Shah’s descendants including Junaid Shah were persuaded for this administrative change, however, given the family’s historical contribution the name of Nawabshah taluka was kept intact. Syeds live in their family home in midst of Nawabshah that had given birth to Naushahro Feroz as a separate district in the past. Nawabshah is home to communities and tribes like Zardaris, Buledis, Jamalis, Syeds, Jatois, Unnars, Dahiris, Pitafis, Pirzadas and others. Among them, many have large landholdings. Electoral politics revolved around them with the active assistance of smaller communities.  
Nawabshah is considered the fastest-growing urban centre with 30 per cent urban population as per Census 2017 figures in four talukas. 

Growers believe that citrus cultivation has the potential to replace mango orchard’s contractual farming if growers get market linkages and assistance

A lined portion of the perennial Rohri canal (which flows 12 months) and is considered to be a mini-Indus, runs parallel to the project at a considerable length. Benazirabad has lately become a separate and sixth division with Nawabshah as divisional headquarters, taking Benazirabad, Sanghar and Naushahro Feroz districts in its fold. It has four higher seats of learning — a medical, engineering, general and veterinary varsity. 
The landscape of the agriculture sector here is quite rich in colour and strong in nature. The district — created in 1912 under the British Raj — is home to all three major crops: sugar cane, cotton and wheat. The fourth one, rice, is grown as well although it is banned. In terms of fruits, Benazirabad produces bananas and mangoes but what made it unique is the cultivation of citrus fruits — grapefruits, organs and lemons. It shows how nature has blessed this area with immense diversity in the farm sector.  
Citrus cultivation, growers believe, has the potential to replace mango orchard’s contractual farming if growers get market linkages and assistance. Among citrus fruits, mosmi or mittha (a variety of orange) and grapefruit are showing encouraging results productivity and acreage wise. Over the 
last several years, some growers have shown an inclination for growing citrus and progressive 
grower, Syed Zain Shah, a native of Benazirabad district and grandson of G.M. Syed, is one of them.  
Mr Zain Shah started citrus farming five years back and has gradually taken grapefruit’s acreage to 100 acres out of total orchard related landholding. “It yielded good results in terms of productivity. Even in terms of contractual offers, contractors give better rates when compared with mango orchard’s contract on an annual basis,” he says. “A grower having grapefruit cultivation can get Rs50,000 or so an acre more when compared with mango’s contractual farming.” 
Under contractual farming, growers get fixed money known as maqata against over their farm under agreement for a certain period. “Climate suits grapefruits in Nawabshah, Qazi Ahmed, Daur and Sakrand,” he remarks. He feels growers are showing now interest and emulating him. He has put in plenty of effort in the past five years in citrus farming.
The district’s Sakrand taluka is considered to be the ‘centre’ point of Sindh, bifurcating its lower and upper regions. Given its climatic conditions, institutes or centres for these cotton and wheat crops were set up for research. “Our varieties like benazir-13 or imdad-5 are showing good results as far as per acre productivity is concerned. Another variety TD-1 is grown in areas of central Punjab,” points out Dr Karim Bux Leghari, director of Wheat Research Centre which has been working here since 1992.  
Sukkur barrage’s second-largest Rohri canal feeds the Benazirabad district. Of the canal’s 16,500 cusecs discharge, according to the irrigation department, 4,243 cusecs are diverted to Benazirabad district for agriculture purposes, 2,915 cusecs for Nasrat and 1,328 cusecs for Dad division of Rohri canal. 
Rohri was the only off-taking canal of Sukkur barrage whose around 20km length was lined in 2015-2016 in the Benazirabad district at a cost of Rs10.507 billion in two phases. Its third phase is said to be in process. The canal, however, faces the menace of direct outlets (DOs) like Nara and other canals. DOs obtained by the high and mighty destroy the flow regime of irrigation water but their flows go unchecked and are considered to be a leading cause of water-logging in certain areas.  
Wheat acreage in 2021-22 season stands at 240,000 acres, sugarcane at 80,000 acres and cotton at 105,000 acres. Rice despite being a banned crop in left-bank areas of Sukkur and Guddu barrages is grown in Benazirabad. Its area was reported at around 13,500 acres. Besides major crops, veggies including onion, chillis and tomatoes were cultivated. Fodder crops including maize, millet and jawar were regularly grown crops here, accounting for a cumulative 6,500 acres. The agriculture department shows grapefruit’s acreage at 2,100 acres, banana at 16,500 acres, mango’s 8,500 acres and lemon at 2,600 acres.
Cotton production which has been showing a countrywide decline over the last several years is said to have witnessed a marked change in 2021-22 in cotton-producing districts of Sindh inclusive of Shaheed Benazirabad. Against last year’s production of 52,564 bales in 2020-21, the district is said to have produced 186,000 bales in 2021-22. Sindh’s total production this year is around 3.5 million bales against a target of 4m bales, according to cotton commissioner Muneer Ahmed Jumani.  
The fiscal year 2009-10 was exceptional as Sindh grew 4.2m bales production against a target of 3.2m. Benazirabad achieved a 98pc acreage target of cotton sowing which was fixed at 60,000 hectares in that year. But average yields remains 15-16 maunds an acre. The same goes for sugarcane acreage and production figures insofar as Benazirabad is concerned, with the district contributing to 10.5pc in acreage and 10.5pc in production in 2016-17. 
Benazirabad has four sugar factories, procuring sugarcane from Benazirabad and its adjoining districts as sugar cane cultivation emerged as a major crop in the recent past. 
Benazirabad has one of the famous irrigated forests, Pai, stretching over around 4,700 acres. It has a notified game reserve of the Sindh Wildlife Department. The entire Pai forest area used to be riverine forests until the Sukkur barrage was built along with dykes’ construction on the right and left bank on Indus.
Sindh’s livestock department estimates Shaheed Benazirabad has a 5.45pc share in cattle and buffalo population as per 2018’s projected livestock population and 4.34pc in small animals including sheep and goats. And last but not least Benazirabad is also home to Naz Mukhtiar Dharejo — popularly known as Waderi Nazo — perhaps the only female grower from here — who was actively managing her farmland after fighting against her family members-turned-foes over agricultural lands.

5,The digital transformation of SMEs,"Digital transformation is no longer a “nice to have”, but a “must have” that is crucial to the survival of a business.","Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are considered the lifeblood of any nation’s economy and rightly so because of their high share of employment and value addition. 
In Pakistan, there are about 3.8 million SMEs which according to the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Authority, constitute around 80 to 90 per cent of the country’s private enterprises from industrial, services and trade sectors, employing almost 80pc of the non-agriculture labour force and contributing over 30pc to GDP.
Recognising this potential, the government of Pakistan has been taking some exemplary measures to draw on the maximum potential of this sector such as the ones laid out in SME Policy 2021-25 which include generous tax reductions and big incentives for both men and women entrepreneurs. The SME Development Fund currently under process will extend grants for market access, training and business development. The recent expansion in Pakistan’s SMEs sector is also a testament to the favourable business environment in the country.

According to a study conducted in India by Google and KPMG, the revenue and profit of digital SMEs grow twice as fast as their offline counterparts and they can hire up to five times the number of employees

However, the last year with the pandemic presented one more area that needs work: digitalisation. Today, no matter what the size of the company, its location or its line of business, technology is an ally for the success of all companies. Now, digital transformation is no longer a “nice to have”, but a “must have” that is crucial to the survival of a business.
According to a study conducted in India by Google and KPMG, the revenue and profit of digital SMEs grow twice as fast as their offline counterparts. The introduction of digital platforms enables them to discover new market opportunities and drive overall growth. This is not only reflected in the company’s profits, but compared with offline employees, they can hire up to five times the number of employees.
Nevertheless, every digital transformation strategy looks different since every company has unique needs and pursues its own goals. Therefore, the foundation of any solid transformation is a complete document of the company’s needs. By pre-modelling business processes, companies can prioritise specific issues and understand what specific elements are hindering a smooth operation. For example, it is important to first determine which activities are time-consuming and can be automated, or which data should be accessible to improve customer experience.
The common misconception that technology is only accessible to large companies with big budgets is misplaced. SMEs can also leverage technology to drive better efficiencies, innovation and growth. In fact, compared to larger companies, SMEs are well placed to take advantage of technology. Because of their size, SMEs are more agile and are able to make decisions faster and respond to changing market conditions quicker. 
An automated system helps companies manage the countless processes that make the businesses function effectively, such as finance, human resources, supply chain, procurement, and customer relationship management to name a few. Digitalisation not only enhances a company’s ongoing operations but also helps them unlock the value of their data to optimise decision making and support continued innovation in the future. 
It adds visibility across the entire company, preventing silos, streamlining processes and making the work manageable with intelligent capabilities.
Digital transformation is a path that all SMEs must begin to follow in order to keep up with their consumers, so it is better to start earlier, even with a small step. With Pakistan’s IT strength growing exponentially and the nationwide digital Pakistan initiative progressing rapidly, it is a good omen for businesses to benefit from this changing dynamic and bring intelligence to their operations to efficiently serve their consumers’ changing needs. Crossing the digital divide can help small businesses have a big reach with better business gains than ever.

6,Debate on development strategy,"It's being acknowledged that growth isn't socially sustainable as retribution of wealth, incomes, assets stand outside its ambit.","


 
Social exclusion and its fallout have prompted policymakers, think tanks and economists to engage in the national discourse on how to forge an inclusive and sustainable development agenda with required policy adjustments. 
While it is recognised that economic growth is important for raising national output, it is also being increasingly acknowledged that growth is not socially sustainable as retribution of wealth, incomes and assets stand outside the ambit of growth. 
According to a nationwide survey conducted by Transparency International (TI), some 88.9 per cent of the respondents surveyed said their income had shrunk over the last three years. Rising inflation, shrinking real wages, limited decent jobs, unemployment and poverty remain major public concerns despite the economic recovery and expanding social safety network. 
The trickle-down effect, it is said, comes into play when the growth rate remains very high for a prolonged period, but it is not possible without social and human resource development. The PTI government is trying to develop a bottom-up approach to push up growth in such sectors as small- and medium-sized industries (SMEs). Yet there has been a long delay in the government’s approval of the proposed Small and Medium Size Enterprises Policy 2021, disappointing the business community.

In the view of a major segment of respondents — 72.8pc — corruption at the grassroots level had increased in the public sector due to the absence of elected local governments

“Development should be inclusive and must demonstrate trickle-down effect with the aim to empower lower strata of society,” Prime Minister Imran Khan said in a video message sent to the recently organised Sustainable Development Conference (SDC) titled ‘Beyond the Pandemic: Leaving No One Behind.’ However, the PTI government has not been able so far to implement its manifesto to empower people at the grassroots level because of tough resistance from ‘electable’ members in its fold.
The SDC was organised by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute to ‘pick up’ the debate on redefining and reshaping the post-pandemic new development agenda with a view to making existing policies inclusive while looking through the prism of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The illusion of prosperity, built on borrowed money, is a priority over development, says eminent economist Sakib Sherani. He emphasised that the elitist policymakers would do well to study the development path of successful peer countries, adding, “Pakistan should live within its means”.   
Visiting Pakistan some time ago renowned economist Jeffrey D. Sachs (dedicated to the cause of ending poverty) cautioned policymakers that there is economic growth but no development. And in this context, Mr Sherani says “the country’s free-riding elites have to be made to carry their share of responsibility.” 
The idea of people-centred economic development, first surfaced in the early 1970s but was put on the back burner while international efforts were directed to tackle stagflation through rapid financial globalisation. That worked for a while but finally led to frequent financial/debt crises, worsened the chronic balance of payments problem in many countries, stifled economic development and further widened inequality among and within nations. 
With the frequent cyclic and systemic crises haunting policymakers, the United Nations came up with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2015-2030.
Though much more left to do, Pakistan’s scored 1.5pc higher in the SDGs Index 2021 at 57.7pc compared to 2020. Despite the Covid-19 push back, the country’s GDP Global Ranking was at 129 in 2021. It is an improvement in the ranking from 134 amongst 166 countries in 2020.
For a sustainable economy, the prime minister’s advisor on finance and revenue Shaukat Tarin says the government is working on improving revenue collection, raising agricultural productivity and increasing industrial production. 
The disparity in household incomes and development among and within provinces is widening the disconnect between a hybrid government and the deprived and oppressed groups and communities. One can assess the mounting public discontentment from the surging social and political activism with more and more protestors taking to the streets. There is a strong backlash against Sindh Local Bodies (Amendments) Bill 2021 for denying the local government full political, administrative and financial autonomy. 
“You can’t have national security until there is inclusive development,” Prime Minister Imran Khan said while addressing the Margalla Dialogue 21 on the theme ‘Breaking Past, Entering Future’ organised by the Islamabad Policy Research Institute in collaboration with the National Security Division.
Years ago, a social scientist suggested that it is both active masses and active leaders who can together help resolve problems of the have-nots. While still in power, former US president Obama told a trade union gathering that the responsibility of the people does not end just by exercising their right to vote. And PPP founder Zulfikar Ali Bhutto said “the people lead and the people are led.” It is the genuine representatives of the people elected in a free and fair election in 1970 who gave the country the 1973 Constitution.
Hybrid democracy nurturing social exclusion is creating a vacuum for the development of participatory democracy which begins with the empowerment of the third government tier and local communities in the formal sector and efforts of the common citizens to fend for their livelihood in an informal economy. For example, a teacher with a poor salary has left her job to work as a better paid domestic servant in Phase VIII of Defence Housing Society, Karachi. Finding it very difficult to survive on tuition fees to foot his expenses on bare essentials, a college student from South Punjab learnt to cook from TV classes, and is now working as a cook in the same area. 
Balochistan is working on an ‘innovative’ community-led local governance policy. As equal partners in the local government/councils, the already registered and mobilised communities are expected to play a key role in the development process at the grassroots level. 
Around 47.8pc of Pakistanis surveyed by TI believe that the government‘s campaign to create awareness about the pandemic could have been launched in a more effective manner if elected representatives of local bodies were present. Health costs during pandemic estimated by the World Health Organisation have pushed over half a billion people in the world into poverty.
The TI’s National Corruption Survey 2021 sought responses from 1,600 people from four cities each in every province of Pakistan. In the view of a major segment of respondents — 72.8pc — corruption at the grassroots level had increased in the public sector due to the absence of elected local governments.

7,The housing crisis,Only 1pc of the housing units are developed yearly for 68pc of the total population consisting of people with monthly...,"The real estate industry in Pakistan began from Karachi though it was present before the partition. Property tycoons constructed buildings but the selling of plots was atypical. The industry started progressing in the 1950s and Defence Housing Authority (DHA) came into being. 
In 1960, plots in DHA flourished. The industry was making headway from 1970-1974. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Bhutto launched the Amnesty Scheme and the market boomed till 1977. The catastrophic deluge in DHA and post-election insurrection doomed the industry till 1982. The Afghan war brought a bulk of finance to the market from 1982-1988. The sudden death of the then president halted the industry from 1988 to 1992.
The market lingered leisurely from 1992-1994 and caught its next thrust from 1994-1997. The market suffered a recession from 1997-2001. The industry got its major boom after 9/11. The upturn broke all the past peak records. The gigantic price hike brought forth the money mongers in the early 2000s. The next recession toppled the market from 2005-2010. The market retook in 2012 until 2015. 
The patterns of market trends remained the same for 43 years out of its 69 years. The boom ratio is 4 to 5 years. The proportion of price increment in urban areas is 4-5 per cent and for rural areas, it is around 9-10pc. During the recession, the prices in urban areas fall from 0.5-1pc and in rural areas, it is almost 5pc. Globally, the real estate industry normally follows a stable escalation rate of 5-8pc yearly. 

Only 1pc of the housing units are developed yearly for 68pc of the total population consisting of people with monthly incomes of mere 
  Rs 30,000

The year 2016 was an extremely promising one for the industry as in 2015, the outlay in the residential property increased by 5-7pc while commercial property saw a boost of 15-20pc across Pakistan. The Federal Budget 2015-16 brought much-needed tax relief to the sector until 2018. Customs duty on the import of construction machinery was also abridged to 10pc.
Data by the Federal Board of Revenue and industry surveys guesstimate the industry is worth more than $700 billion. The industry accounts for roughly 2pc of GDP. It not only spawns a high level of direct employment but also stimulates more than 250 subsidiary sectors. If the bucolic to metropolitan exodus persists at the existing rate, the urbanisation level to an unprecedented 53.3pc.
The trend of buying luxury apartments has increased nearly by 7-9pc during the last decade. Therefore from 2010-2016 apartment prices increased 120pc, while houses registered an increase of 80pc. Pakistan has a housing surfeit of almost 12 million units. Even more astonishing is that for an industry that had been registering double-digit growth since 2010, with new suburban projects proclaimed almost weekly, more than 50pc of the metropolitan population lives in slums and squatter settlements that lack basic necessities. 
Only 1pc of the housing units are developed yearly for the 68pc of the total population, consisting of people with monthly incomes of mere Rs 30,000. On the other hand, almost 56pc of housing units target 12pc of the population, comprising individuals with a monthly income of Rs 100,000 or above. 
The mortgage rates are still considerably higher compared to the region: Hong Kong (2.15pc), Japan (2.7pc), China (7-8pc) and India (8-12pc). The real estate seems dispatched to Mount Caucasus. The property in cheap parts of Islamabad during the early 1980s, for a 1,500sqft house in G sector, was $10,000. In a decade it tripled to around $30,000, then in the 2000s it tripled again to $100,000 and now it’s around $200,000 at least for the same old house in decrepit shape. So the price in the previous 30 years has risen 20 times. This is unimaginable anywhere else in the world. 
In the USA after the 2008 Housing bubble burst, the house prices came crashing down but over here it is quite the opposite. Covid-19 played a vital role in the economic slowdown of the whole world and affected the sector gravely. 
The worst part is that financial tycoons have made the industry a cradle of corruption, land mafia, land grabbers and blackmailers. The black giants have even grappled with the state via real estate. The mafia of the real estate sector is way powerful than others. They have set up charity institutions, trusts, and print and electronic media houses to apply pressure on the state.

8,Data points,Crimes against car drivers,"Crimes against car drivers
Uber and Lyft — which were already struggling with a shortage of drivers caused by Covid-19 concerns — are grappling with a rise in violent crimes and implementing new safety measures and policies to try to better protect drivers. Drivers aren’t returning as quickly as consumers, despite big bonuses from companies and the expiration of temporary unemployment benefits extended to gig workers. While the companies declined to share data on attacks on their drivers, available data in some cities suggest drivers are getting caught up in a surge of carjackings, murders and other violent crimes. The ride-sharing apps have long had safety measures — for example, Uber has an emergency button that connects drivers to 911 and shares their GPS coordinates with dispatchers. Lyft has a similar feature. Both companies are adding more. Drivers are doing what they can to protect themselves. Some will only work during the daytime or pick up passengers from the airport. Others have taken to wearing bulletproof vests.

Retaining and recruiting employees
There are three points that every executive should be considering as they think about recruiting and retaining employees:1) Employees want a healthy, future-oriented way of working — when people want more autonomy to live a multistage life, the organisational variable they most treasure is flexibility. 2) Bad jobs (long hours, low pay, no training, poor prospects) are on their way out — as the labour market tightens, people pay more attention to their ideas about what could be and seek alternative ways of working. 3) Other companies will change the playing field. Right now, there is a huge swell of experimentation going on. Companies are designing talent practices that, for example, enable people to work from anywhere three months a year, or to seldom come into the office, or to bundle their working hours into just three days or string them out over seven. In every sector right now, some outliers are pushing at the margins of what they’re willing to do to find and keep talented employees.

Climate change is turning beef into a luxury
The boss of Europe’s top meat processor said beef will become a luxury like champagne because of the climate impact of producing it. “Beef is not going to be super climate-friendly,” Danish Crown Chief Executive Officer Jais Valeur said in an interview with Danish newspaper Berlingske. “It will be a luxury product that we eat when we want to treat ourselves.” Mr Valeur said pork would be a more climate-friendly protein. Danish Crown is one of Europe’s largest pork producers, although it is also a player in the beef market. Meat companies are coming under pressure to curb greenhouse gases, with 57pc of all food industry emissions coming from making animal products, according to one study. Tackling methane emissions from livestock is one of the most critical climate challenges for producers.

How to convince yourself to do hard things
When you’re tired or stressed, your brain wants to help you make decisions quickly. Plus, you’re wired to move toward things that make you feel good and away from things that make you feel uncomfortable. So how do you do hard things when your brain is constantly telling you to avoid effort? Tackle them when you’re in a good mood. When they are feeling upbeat, however, they’re more likely to take on the hard-but-essential tasks that ultimately make life better. Give your brain the right amount of autonomy. When you have a choice, your brain may want to default to something easy. But you can mitigate that response by challenging yourself to be innovative and provide incentives. Practice the habits of a growth mindset and notice when you revert to old ways of thinking and behaving. And acknowledge the progress made by attempting a new habit.

14,The cost of empty stadiums,Investing in better measures and a streamlined process to improve earnings seems an easy way to garner bigger bucks from cricket.,"As over 87,000 people watched in person, Pakistan won its first, and only (as yet), ICC Cricket World Cup in 1992, a win so cherished that the captain of the team eventually was elected to lead the nation.
The country is cricket crazed, no one doubts that. So why then have the stands been so empty during the Pakistan vs West Indies series? A similar question was raised by Wasim Akram on Twitter which was responded with nearly 2,500 comments and 16,000 likes.
A barrage of responses from wait times, the barriers to purchasing tickets, lack of marketing hype, a Covid-depleted West Indies team and weekday matches were the responses. A cricket fan also bemoaned the lack of Karachites in Pakistan’s playing 11. “How can a city this big not produce one cricketer fit to represent his country in his home town,” he bemoaned.
Popularity
People just did not seem as interested as they were last month during the T20 world cup. The hype did not carry forward it seems. 
Ratings account for the number of people watching the match. According to data shared by TV rating provider Media Logic, the average viewership of the Pakistan vs West Indies series in urban areas was 6.5 per cent on PTV Sports, peaking at 9.5pc for the final. (Maximum rating is the highest number of people watching during any 30-minute slot during a match.)

A simple dollar comparison between the two bat and ball obsessed nations is this: an IPL match can garner an estimated $2.63m while an international three-day match in Pakistan can garner a maximum of $0.33m as revenue from tickets

Across the recent International Cricket Council (ICC) world cup tournament, the average was 9.9pc with the peak being 17.1pc in Pakistan vs Australia semi-final. The joyful Pakistan vs India match’s average rating was 9.6pc with a peak of 12.7pc. Even the small fish matches of Nambia and Scotland garnered an average rating of 8.1pc and 7.3pc respectively on PTV Sports.
Keeping aside that a world cup event garners more traction than a bilateral series, given that it was held in Pakistan, the general lack of interest coming at the heels of the majestic (albeit ultimately heartbreaking) performance of the team in the world cup is surprising. It speaks volumes about the lack of marketing efforts by the Pakistan Cricket Board.
Declining to comment or answer questions, a Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official forwarded COO Salman Naseer’s press conference in response. While admitting that there was room for improvement in marketing of the series to fill the stands, the harried-looking Mr Naseer defended the decision of weekday matches. “The schedule was set up in consultation with various law enforcement agencies and bodies including the National Command Operation Centre,” he said. The one day internationals (ODI) would have been held over this weekend had covid not made it impossible. 
Stadium revenue
India’s (and the world’s) largest stadium — Narendra Modi Stadium — in Ahmedabad has a capacity of 132,000 compared to the roughly 30,000-40,000 capacity of National Stadium. Arguably, India’s population is roughly four times that of Pakistan but in terms of cities, Karachi’s official tally of 15 million is almost twice that of Ahmedabad’s estimated 8m.
About 3m people applied for the 650,000 tickets available across the ICC ODI world cup held in England in 2019, according to a Forbes article. The India vs Pakistan match was the most requested game, even more so than the final. Secondary market prices started at $500 and ran into thousands of dollars, the article said.
Pakistan has made cricket affordable. Seats in the general enclosure are for Rs250, first-class enclosure are for Rs500, premium enclosures are for Rs1,000 and VIP enclosure is for Rs2,000. Assuming a capacity of 30,000 at the lowest price, the minimum revenue is Rs7.5 million and the maximum is Rs60m. This translates to Rs22.5-180m over the three-match tournament that the West Indies team had to postpone because of Covid cases, assuming filled stands.
One calculation of Indian Premier League (IPL) tickets are as follows: assuming a capacity of 40,000 and the average ticket cost of INR 5,000 (the price of IPL tickets are not the same for all the teams — the tickets start at INR500 for Kolkata Knight Riders and go up to tens of thousands), a single IPL match can garners INR 200m.
A simple dollar comparison between the two bat and ball obsessed nations is this: an IPL match can garner an estimated $2.63m while an international three-day match in Pakistan can garner a max of $0.33m as revenue from tickets.
A Gallup Gillani poll indicated that 70pc of Pakistanis believe that cricket is akin to patriotism. Investing in better measures and a streamlined process to improve earnings seems a relatively easy way to garner bigger bucks from crickets. Bigger in-stadium crowds also open increase revenue through merchandising and snacks.  
At the peak of hopelessness, cricket fans wondered whether they would be able to see a cricket match played in their home country. With the Pakistan Super League and upcoming Australia tour planned by PCB, the dream has become as big a reality as Pakistan knocking the socks of the Indian team in the recent T20 tournament.
While the country may not have money to ensure food for the hungry, much less sports, the least that can be done is to facilitate cricket fans to be able to watch the series in person. Can scheduling matches on weekends and ensuring a smooth process for purchasing tickets really be challenging for a game that is opium for the masses? Let us hope that when (if) the West Indies returns in early June 2022 for the remaining of the matches, the team will play in packed stadiums.

15,Surging Covid-19 cases bring a 2020 feel to  the end of 2021,The already beleaguered travel and tourism industry is being particularly hammered.,"US officials intensified calls last week for unvaccinated Americans to get inoculated in the face of the new omicron variant that contributed to a record number of infections in New York and threatened to wipe out a second holiday season in Europe.
Though the calendar is about to change, there is a distinctly 2020 feel: The National Football League games were postponed because of Covid-19 infections. The Rockettes cancelled Christmas shows. European governments imposed a spate of restrictions that ground travel to a halt and saw travellers lying low.
Much remains unknown about omicron, but officials warn that it appears more transmissible than the delta variant, which has already put pressure on hospitals worldwide. The uncertainty alone was enough for many people to change their plans.
In the United States, President Joe Biden’s administration resisted tightening any restrictions, but also sketched out dire scenarios for the unvaccinated in a plea for hesitant Americans to get the shot.
For the unvaccinated, you’re looking at a winter of severe illness and death, for yourselves, your families, and the hospitals you may soon overwhelm, White House coronavirus response coordinator Jeff Zients said last week, echoing the president’s own comments earlier.

President Joe Biden’s administration resisted tightening any restrictions, but also sketched out dire scenarios for the unvaccinated in a plea for hesitant Americans to get the shot

The new variant is already in full force in New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio said, with new cases hitting a one-day record of more than 8,300 last Thursday. But new hospitalisations and deaths so far are well below their spring 2020 peak and even where they were this time last year, city data shows.
The coronavirus also interrupted sports in the US again. The NFL announced last week that three games would be pushed from the weekend to next week because of outbreaks. The league has not specified whether the cases came from the omicron variant.
The Radio City Rockettes called off four performances scheduled for last week because of breakthrough Covid-19 cases in the production, and plans for upcoming shows were still being assessed. The popular holiday program generally has four shows per day in December at Radio City Music Hall in Manhattan.
Dr Stanley Weiss, a Rutgers University epidemiology professor, said officials need to react faster, citing a willingness to redefine fully vaccinated to include booster shots, for example.
Everyone wants us to be through with this pandemic, but in order to get us through it, we can’t ignore the realities of what’s going on and what is needed, Mr Weiss said.
Denmark decided to close theatres, concert halls, amusement parks and museums in response to virus cases. In Spain, friends and classmates cancelled traditional year-end dinners.
Scotland and Wales last week pledged millions of pounds for businesses hurt in Britain’s latest infection surge, a move that heaped pressure on Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government to do the same in England.
Treasury chief Rishi Sunak held talks with business representatives who have demanded more support, decrying a lockdown by stealth in which government officials recommend people cut back on socialising as much as possible without officially imposing the strict rules of past shutdowns.
Britain reported record numbers of infections three days in a row this week, the latest on last Friday with more than 93,000 cases tallied.
Businesses ranging from vacation providers to pubs and theatres saw a wave of cancellations as customers decided to skip merrymaking for now rather than risk being infected and missing family celebrations later.
Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said last week that financial assistance for business must come from the central government because it has the borrowing power to finance the scale of aid that is needed.
The already beleaguered travel and tourism industry is being particularly hammered.
Eurostar, which operates trains across the English Channel, sold out of tickets to France last week before new rules restricting travel to and from Britain took effect. Long lines snaked around the parking lot at the Eurotunnel, which runs the tunnel that drivers use to cross the water.
Ryanair originally expected to carry about 11 million passengers in December, but that figure dropped to 10m, chief executive Michael OLeary told the Guardian. Europe’s biggest airline will also cut about 10 per cent of its capacity in January.
Amanda Wheelock, 29, a graduate student at the University of Michigan, cancelled a trip to France with her partner as cases spiked there. Even though the surge isn’t necessarily due to omicron, the uncertainty about the new variant, and a new requirement that all US travellers have to test negative before flying back to the US, made her worry that the trip would be more stressful than fun.
