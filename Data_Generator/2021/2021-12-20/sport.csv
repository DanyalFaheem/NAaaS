Abraham scored his first less than a minute into the match and Nicolo Zaniolo doubled Roma’s lead. An own goal from Bryan Cristante made it 2-1 at the end of the first half.
Cristante had another own goal ruled out shortly before Chris Smalling all but secured the win in the 72nd minute. Abraham capped a brilliant match for Roma 10 minutes later.
Roma moved to fifth, five points below fourth-placed Napoli and six below Gian Piero Gasperini’s Atalanta in third. League leaders Inter Milan have six more points than Atalanta.
“What a win. What. A. Win,” Abraham said. “A lot of people doubted us today, they said it was mission impossible for us as a team, but this is by far one of the best wins we’ve had this season. You can see by everyone’s reaction.”
Juventus are below Roma on goal difference alone after winning at Bologna 2-0. Head-to-head is the first tiebreaker in Serie A at the end of the season.
Roma’s goals came from five shots on target after having less than 30 percent possession and no corners.
The match turned during four minutes midway through the second half in which Atalanta had a leveller ruled out by VAR for Jose Luis Palomino straying offside after challenging for Duvan Zapata’s flick with Cristante and Smalling then poked home Roma’s third.
The decision to rule out the hosts’ leveller infuriated Gasperini who raged to DAZN that the referee told him a Palomino goal had been ruled out even though the Argentine had not, in fact, touched the ball.
If Palomino didn’t touch the ball, then why is it offside? If Cristante got the ball, then what difference does it make?” he asked.
Alvaro Morata and Juan Cuadrado scored as Massimiliano Allegri’s Juve came away with the three points following a dogged performance at a ground which has proved tough terrain for some of Serie A’s leading sides and was enveloped in thick fog for almost the entire match.
After a surprise draw at Venezia, Juve needed a good result and things appeared to be going to plan when they took the lead in the sixth minute. Morata raced from near the halfway line before laying it off to Federico Bernardeschi, who threaded it through for the Spaniard to blast into the top right corner.
But after that positive start, Juve did little but defend and Bologna threatened several times to equalise — notably with an overhead kick from Mattias Svanberg that flew just past the left post.
Juve’s second came out of nowhere in the 69th, when a powerful effort from Cuadrado was deflected into the far top corner.
Gabriele Cioffi’s impressive start to his Serie A coaching career continued as he steered Udinese to a 4-0 win at 10-man Cagliari.
Cioffi replaced Luca Gotti as coach at the beginning of the month and is unbeaten. Udinese moved 10 points above the drop zone while Cagliari remained two points below safety.

1,Dortmund loss at Hertha leaves Bayern nine points clear,BERLIN: Hertha Berlin finally delivered the performance their long-suffering fans were waiting for by coming from...,"BERLIN: Hertha Berlin finally delivered the performance their long-suffering fans were waiting for by coming from behind to beat Borussia Dortmund 3-2 in the Bundesliga on Saturday.
Former Bayern Munich youth player Marco Richter scored twice to give Hertha fans an early Christmas present and do his old team a favour. Bayern were left nine points clear at the top at the halfway stage, the league’s winter break.
Just, there were few fans in Berlins Olympiastadion to see it. Capacity was capped at 5,000 due to restrictions against the coronavirus.
It was arguably Hertha’s best performance of the season, and it gave new coach Tayfun Korkut his second win from four games in charge since taking over from the fired Pal Dardai.
Julian Brandt gave Dortmund a first-half lead, but Hertha roared back with three unanswered goals at Berlin’s Olympic Stadium as Ishak Belfodil equalised before Richter scored twice.
Dortmund substitute striker Steffen Tigges pulled one back shortly after replacing Brandt, but Hertha managed to hold on.
We gave the game away,” admitted Dortmund goalkeeper Marwin Hitz.We did nothing in the 20 minutes after half-time and only after were we back in it.”
Earlier, Eintracht Frankfurt continued their rise up the table with a sixth win in seven games as Danish forward Jesper Lindstrom scored for the third match in succession to seal a 1-0 victory over Mainz 05.
Frankfurt broke into the top five, having started last weekend 12th.
A brilliant early goal from Max Kruse was enough for Union Berlin to finish the year on a high after winning at Bochum 1-0. Union climbed to sixth, level on 27 points with Frankfurt.
Fourth-placed Hoffenheim snatched a 1-1 draw at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach after defender Kevin Akpoguma tapped in a last-gasp equaliser.
Gladbach, who had lost their four previous league games, took a first-half lead when Swiss striker Breel Embolo scored from close range.
RB Leipzig’s hopes of a fresh start under new coach Domenico Tedesco are fading after losing at home to 10-man Arminia Bielefeld 2-0.
Greuther Fuerth are now 11 points adrift at the foot of the table after their goalless draw at home to Augsburg.

The day after the match between Paris FC and Olympique Lyonnais was halted at half-time following incidents in the stands, the tie between the amateurs of JSCBA Nimes and Ligue 1 Clermont was briefly interrupted.
The game was halted because of crowd problems in the 76th minute, but after a six-minute delay during which the riot police were deployed, Clermont completed a 4-0 victory.
At Troyes, the bad behaviour came from the visiting players.
Nancy, bottom of the second division, collected three red cards but still hung on to beat Ligue 1 Troyes on penalties.
Maxime Nonnenmacher, a 19-year-old midfielder, collected his second yellow card in the 32nd minute when he was late in a tackle on Brandon Domingues.
Nancy conceded just before half-time after Edmond Akichi brought down Suk Hyun-Jun at a corner. Domingues sent the goalkeeper the wrong way from the spot.
But the 10 men hit back when Andrew Jung deflected home a free-kick in the 75th minute.
A minute later Nancy’s Saliou Ciss was shown a straight red card.
Souleymane Karamoko then collected a second yellow card deep into added time, leaving Nancy to play a few seconds three men down before the game ended 1-1. They won the shootout 4-2 to advance.
Warmed Omari’s first-half goal earned Stade Rennais a 1-0 home win over Lorient in the Brittany derby as the 2019 winners also advanced.
Omari scored from a goalmouth scramble in the 21st minute and Bruno Genesio’s side stayed in control to progress.
Elsewhere, fifth division AS Cannes, whose youth academy produced France greats Zinedine Zidane and Patrick Vieira, caused an upset by eliminating Dijon 3-2 on penalties after the game had ended in a 1-1 draw after 90 minutes.
French champions Lille advanced with a 3-1 win over Ligue 2 AJ Auxerre thanks to first-half goals by Angel Gomes, Jonathan David and Mehmet Zeki Celik.
Nantes, 10th in Ligue 1, were pushed to penalties by Sochaux of Ligue 2 but kept their nerve to also reach the next round, which will be played on Jan 2-3.

Both players held their opening two service games but Rublev edged ahead when he broke Murray in the fifth game after a series of fiercely-fought rallies from the back of the court.
The 24-year-old Russian ran Murray ragged with his powerful groundstrokes but the Briton managed to hold on before Rublev’s pressure paid off and he took the set with a stunning forehand down the line.
The 34-year-old Murray, a former world number one and three-times Grand Slam champion, got off to a poor start in the second set when he lost serve in the first game before fighting back to force a tiebreaker which Rublev dominated to clinch victory.
“I got three good matches here... Andrey played really well today. He’s got a really big game... I just need to find a way to turn some of these matches against these top players around,” said Murray.

Ocampos blasted a ball that came off the crossbar past Jan Olbak with two minutes remaining to clinch the victory over the defending champions at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan, consigning Atleti to a third consecutive league defeat.
It’s a difficult moment but I’m calm,” said Diego Simeone.“I trust in the squad we have.”
Second-placed Sevilla moved to within five points of Real, who have a game in hand.
Atletico almost took a point from Sevilla after Felipe cancelled out a stunning goal from Ivan Rakitic before half-time.
But Jules Kounde keeping the ball alive at the back post after a scramble in the box, which allowed Ocampos to slam in from close range as Sevilla snatched victory at the end.
Barca have long been out of contention for the title, but their fans could at least believe in a brighter future for the team after 17-year-old Gavi teamed with two more youths to beat a resilient Elche 3-2 and end a three-game winless run.
Ferran Jutgla and Gavi scored their first goals for Barca to give them a 2-0 halftime lead.
Elche scored twice in 96 seconds shortly after the hour as Tete Morente and Pere Milla pulled the visitors level but Gavi assisted 19-year-old Nico Gonzalez to score the 85th-minute winner.
“The only thing I was thinking was that that ball had to go in one way or another,” Nico said about his winner. “We are very happy. At 2-2 we knew we were facing a tough rival and recently things have not been going our way.”
Barca are now seventh, two points behind Atletico and three behind Rayo Vallecano in fourth, yet having played one game fewer than Rayo. They are still a distant 15 points from Real.
Rayo maintained their league-best home record after beating Alaves 2-0 for their eighth win in this campaign at Vallecas Stadium.
Gerard Moreno scored two goals and set up another as Villarreal won at Real Sociedad 3-1 for its first road win in the league.

8,England on brink of defeat in Adelaide as Root falls in final over,The tourists' problems stem from losing seven wickets for 86 runs as they collapsed to 236 all out on Saturday.,"ADELAIDE: Joe Root fell in the final over of the fourth day Sunday to leave England in deep trouble at 82 for four chasing a massive 468 to win the second Ashes Test and needing a history-making miracle to avoid slumping 2-0 down in the series.
No team has ever posted such a big score in a fourth innings to win in the history of Test cricket — with the West Indies’ 418 for seven in beating Steve Waugh’s Australia at St John’s in 2003 the highest.
It is an even harder task at the Adelaide Oval, where Australia’s 315 for six to defeat England in 1902 remains the best fourth-innings run chase.
England’s problems stem from losing seven wickets for 86 runs as they collapsed to 236 all out on Saturday in reply to Australia’s 473 for nine declared.
They reached the close with ailing skipper Root out in the last over of the day, leaving Ben Stokes unbeaten on three.
England are still 386 runs adrift, facing the near impossible task of batting three sessions on the final day to salvage a draw with only six wickets left and the world’s number one ranked Test batsman, Root, back in the pavilion.
“Any time one of your best players is out the team takes a knock but what you have to understand and believe is that the rest of the guys are going to fight as hard as he would,” England bowling coach Jon Lewis said of Root.
“They will try to survive the day tomorrow to get ourselves out of this game with a draw. It’s a big ask, I know.”
The hosts resumed their second innings at 45 for one and declared on 230 for nine before tea, giving their bowlers a crack at England with the pink ball as twilight loomed.
They immediately made inroads with Jhye Richard­son steaming in to Haseeb Hameed and the ball flying off his glove to wicketkeeper Alex Carey without scoring.
Then Dawid Malan, who hit 80 in the first innings, was trapped lbw by Michael Neser for 20.
Opener Rory Burns was desperate for a big score after a lean spell and managed 34, but was then beaten by Richardson’s sheer pace, edging to Smith at slip.
Root hurt his abdomen during a warm-up and missed the opening 85 minutes while he went for a scan.
He appeared mostly untroubled while batting but late in the day took a nasty blow in the same, sensitive, area from Mitchell Starc to leave him writhing in agony.
Root gingerly got up, but in a huge blow was out for 24 in the final over, caught by Carey off Starc.
With England crashing by nine wickets in the first Test at Brisbane, their hopes are all but over of going into the Boxing Day Test at Melbourne in a week’s time only 1-0 down.
A 2-0 deficit in the five-match series will mean the Ashes are as good as gone. The only instance of a team coming from 2-0 down to win the urn was by Australia in the 1936-37 series.
“Fantastic to get out of the night session with four wickets down and a big day tomorrow,” said Australia vice-captain Travis Head.
“They’ve still got some quality players ... I think Nathan Lyon will play a massive part, the ball is turning.” 
Earlier, Marnus Labuschagne and Travis Head both made 51 for Australia, steadying the innings after England took three wickets for seven runs to start the day.
Marcus Harris resumed not out 21 with nightwatchman Neser on two after they lost David Warner to an amateurish run-out the previous evening.
Neser only survived seven balls before Jimmy Anderson rattled his middle stump, and Harris departed to a blinding catch from wicketkeeper Jos Buttler.
Buttler’s celebrations were short-lived when he incredibly missed a regulation catch off Smith the very next ball, in a blunder reminiscent of the two sitters he put down from Labuschagne in the first innings.
But he made amends by taking another fine diving catch to remove Smith for six off Ollie Robinson.
Head raced to an eighth Test half-century from 49 balls, but then pulled Robi­nson to Ben Stokes in the deep.
Labuschagne took 96 balls to reach his 50 but also holed out to Stokes, becoming part-time spinner Malan’s first Test wicket, before late cameos ahead of the declaration.

9,Pakistan thrash Bangladesh to set up South Korea semi-final clash in Asian Champions Trophy,Pakistan edges Japan on goal difference after both finished level on five points; India tops standings with 10 points.,"DHAKA: A thumping 6-2 victory against Bangladesh saw Pakistan get their first victory of the Asian Champions Trophy, jumping up to third in the table and setting up a semi-final against South Korea.
Pakistan went into their last round-robin game knowing that a two-goal victory would see them leapfrog third-placed Japan, who were hammered 6-0 by India earlier in the day.
But doubles Aijaz Ahmed and Ahmed Nadeem and goals apiece by Afraz and Mohammad Razzaq saw them clinch a four-goal victory with Bangladesh getting both their goals through Arshad Hosein.
Pakistan edged Japan on goal difference after both finished level on five points, one point behind second-placed South Korea while India topped the standings with 10 points.
Bangladesh went into the game having lost their first three matches and knew they had to upset Pakistan in order to make the semi-finals.
Arshad gave them a shock 13th-minute lead only for Ahmed to level matters in the very next minute.
It was the start of Pakistan’s goal rush which saw them score a further four goals in the next 20 minutes.
Aijaz made it 2-1 in the 18th before Afraz got his goal in the 24th. Ahmed got his second goal two minutes later with Razzaq making it 4-1 in the 34th.
Arshad pulled one back for Bangladesh in the 34th but Aijaz sealed victory for his side four minutes later.
Earlier, Harmanpreet Singh converted a penalty corner to give India a 10th minute lead against Japan and Dilpreet Singh made it 2-0 in the 23rd.
Jarmanpreet Singh added the third in the 34th before goals by Sumit, Harmanpreet and Shamsher Singh in the space of seven minutes completed a resounding victory for India.
Japan have work to do if they are to avoid another hammering by India when they meet the Tokyo Olympic bronze medallists in the semi-final on Tuesday.
Pakistan’s match with South Korea on the same day is expected to be a much evenly-contested one after they played a 3-3 draw against each other on Saturday.

11,Covid-hit Chelsea held by Wolves as City top Christmas charts,Clubs to meet today to discuss what action to take as coronavirus crisis worsens in Britain.,"LONDON: Covid-hit Chelsea were held to a goalless draw by Wolverhampton Wanderers on Sunday after the Premier League rejected their request to postpone the game as Manchester City put struggling Newcastle United to the sword. 
Just four games were left on the schedule this weekend out of the original 10 as Britain’s worsening coronavirus crisis took its toll on the Premier League. 
Clubs will meet on Monday to discuss what action to take, with growing questions over the integrity of the competition as the busy festive period looms. 
Stumbling Chelsea, who have struggled with illness and injuries in recent weeks, were only able to name four outfield players on the bench for their match at Molineux. 
The visitors, who have now won just two of their past six league games, enjoyed the bulk of possession but mustered just one shot on target and are now six points behind leaders City. 
Thomas Tuchel was without Romelu Lukaku, Timo Werner and Callum Hudson-Odoi, who have all tested positive for Covid-19. Jorginho, Kai Havertz and Ruben Loftus-Cheek were also not in the squad. 
Chelsea earlier confirmed that their request to have the game called off been turned down. 
The European champions’ request is understood to have been rejected because the Blues were deemed to have had enough players to fulfil the fixture according to Premier League regulations. 
“We did ask to postpone the game,” Tuchel confirmed before kick-off. “We thought we had a strong case regarding the security and the health of the players. 
“We have seven positive cases and every single day we’ve had another positive case coming in. We travelled together for three hours on the bus, we are in meetings together, we have lunch and dinners together. The situation does not feel like it will stop.” 
Defending champions City crushed Newcastle 4-0 to confirm their position at the top of the table at Christmas. 
Eddie Howe’s side shot themselves in the foot in just the fifth minute, when calamitous defending handed City the lead after goalkeeper Martin Dubravka had carelessly conceded a corner. 
The defence only half-cleared and Joao Cancelo hooked the ball back into the six-yard box. Newcastle appeared to be in little danger but Ciaran Clark inexplicably chose not to make a simple headed clearance and Ruben Dias headed the loose ball into the net. 
The home side rallied and Joelinton went close to equalising with a stinging shot from distance that flew just wide of Ederson’s right-hand post. 
But City silenced the passionate crowd at St James’s Park shortly before the half-hour, when Cancelo jinked his way past Joe Willock and Isaac Hayden before smashing a right-footed shot past the helpless Dubravka from the edge of the area. 
City maintained their firm grip on the match in the second half, with Riyad Mahrez and Raheem Sterling doubling their lead. 
Pep Guardiola’s City have now won eight league games in a row to move four points clear of second-placed Liverpool, who were in action at Tottenham Hotspur later on Sunday. 
But relegation-threated Newcastle remain three points from safety having now played two games more than Watford, who are just outside the drop zone. 
In the only Premier League match to take place on Saturday, injury-hit Leeds United slumped to their second alarming loss in five days, 4-1 at home to Arsenal. 
The match was marred by an allegation of racial abuse from a spectator toward Arsenal’s players. It was reported to officials by Arsenal, manager Mikel Arteta said. 
Coming off a 7-0 thrashing at City on Tuesday, Leeds were down to nine senior players and with a 15-year-old on the bench amid an injury crisis was ripped apart in the first half as Gabriel Martinelli scored twice and Bukayo Saka added another. 
Leeds lost another player, Jack Harrison, to injury before halftime and manager Marcelo Bielsa had his head bowed as he walked back to the dressing rooms, with his team having allowed 15 shots on goal in a chaotic display. 
The home side was better organized in the second half and managed a consolation when Raphinha converted a penalty after 19-year-old striker Joe Gelhardt was tripped by Ben White. 
Substitute Emile Smith Rowe’s 84th-minute goal, after he was played through by Martin Odegaard, piled on the misery for Leeds, who are five points above the relegation zone having played three games more than third-to-last Burnley. 
Arsenal consolidated fourth place in the race for Champions League qualification and is four points above fifth-placed West Ham United having played 18 of 38 games.

Ng Eain Yow overcame Yip Tsz Fung to win the men’s title and end Malaysia’s decade-long drought at the Asian championships but countrywomen Rachel Arnold couldn’t get past Tong Tsz Wing. 
Top-seeded Eain’s 11-6, 13-11, 11-9 victory over Yip in 40 minutes came after he helped Malaysia win the Asian Team Championships earlier this month as he became the first from his country to win the title since Mohd Nafiizwan Adnan in 2011. 
The women’s final lasted 34 minutes as Tong won 11-8, 13-11, 11-5 to deny Arnold a chance to emulate nine-time winner Nicol Ann David as another Malaysian champion.

13,"After Arab Cup, Qatar faces bigger test with World Cup","Qatar will “take account of the lessons learned to organise the best World Cup”, says official.","DOHA: Qatar passed their first test with a successful hosting of the Arab Cup but bigger challenges lie ahead when 1.2 million fans and 32 international teams arrive for the World Cup one year from now. 
Algerian rejoicing at Saturday’s 2-0 extra-time win over Tunisia in the final after goals by substitute Amr Sayoud and Yacine Brahimi — exactly a year before the 2022 World Cup decider, and with FIFA president Gianni Infantino in the stands — will have been accompanied by satisfaction from Qatari officials. 
But now comes the hard work as Qatar prepares for the unique task of hosting a World Cup in and around a single city, Doha, with limited hotel accommodation and a transport network that is likely to come under strain. 
The wealthy Gulf state will also be bracing for intense scrutiny after coming under fire over the rights of the migrant labourers who have built its infrastructure, including the World Cup stadiums. 
And it will be mindful of a cultural gap when fans from around the world arrive in a conservative Muslim country with restricted access to alcohol, and where public drunkenness and homosexual relations are illegal. 
More than 600,000 tickets were sold for the 16-team Arab Cup, including a Qatari-record 63,439 crowd when the hosts played fierce rivals the United Arab Emirates in the quarter-finals. 
Six of the eight World Cup venues were employed as Qatar took the chance to test its stadiums and training sites, transport, accommodation, volunteers and other areas including security. 
A fan ID system was dropped midway through the tournament following reports of long queues and complaints from fans, but crowd trouble appeared limited to some damaged seats at the quarter-final between Tunisia and Oman. 
Qatar will “take account of the lessons learned to organise the best World Cup”, said Jassim Al-Jassim, the organising committee’s vice-president of operations. 
The Lusail Stadium, which will host the World Cup final, was notably not used for the tournament. In October, its project manager said that it still needed final checks and tests. 
Coaches were impressed by the facilities, with Algeria’s Majid Bougherra, a World Cup veteran, saying “everything is perfect” — apart, perhaps, from the accommodation. 
“The stadiums are great, the pitches are great. Perhaps one small downside, but it won’t be the case at the World Cup, is that we were in the same hotel as everyone else,” he said. 
“We congratulate [Qatar] on this beautiful Arab Cup and I think the World Cup will be exceptional,” Bougherra added. 
Egypt coach Carlos Queiroz, the former Iran, Portugal and Real Madrid boss, said the Qatar World Cup has “all the ingredients to succeed”, but called for better communications. 
“If there is one advice I will give to everybody, we need to talk, because the better we talk the better the harmony between the needs inside and outside the pitch,” he said. 
Daniel Reyche, a sport policy and politic researcher and visiting associate professor at Qatar’s Georgetown University, said he was impressed by the organisers’ ability to learn from their mistakes, for example by dropping the fan ID. 
“Overall, I think the test went well, but it is difficult to compare the FIFA Arab Cup and the FIFA World Cup, since most visitors this time came from within the country and next year they will come from outside the country,” he said. 
And after Qatar dismissed concerns from the LGBTQ+ community about attending the World Cup, FIFA secretary-general Fatma Samoura gave assurances next year’s tournament would be inclusive. 
“People are free to display any kind of flag they want, including the rainbow flag, without them being targeted or singled out,” she said this week.
