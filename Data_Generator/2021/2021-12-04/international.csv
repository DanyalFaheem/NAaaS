0,Tropical storm brewing in Bay of Bengal off Indian coast,Scientists say severe storms are becoming more frequent in India.,"HYDERABAD: Indian authorities issued an alert, shut schools and cancelled trains in parts of the country on Friday as rescue teams braced for a tropical storm brewing in the Bay of Bengal.
The storm is expected to hit the coastline of the southern state of Andhra Pradesh on Saturday, then enter eastern Odisha and West Bengal states on Sunday with wind speeds of up to 100 kilometres per hour, Indian Meteorological Department chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said.
Scientists say severe storms are becoming more frequent in India and changing climate patterns have caused them to become more intense.
Andhra Pradesh state relief commissioner Kanna Babu said fishing boats in both states have been ordered to return to harbour and thousands of rescue and relief teams are fanning out for recovery operations.
Mohapatra also said that offshore oil drilling platforms in the region have been advised to suspend activities on Saturday and Sunday.
The storm is expected to trigger heavy to very heavy rain over parts of Andhra Pradesh. On Friday, it was around 650 kilometres from Visakhapatnam, a key port city.
In May, two storms hit India within 10 days, with Cyclone Tauktae killing at least 140 people across western states. Nearly 70 of the victims were on a barge that ripped free of its anchors and sank off Mumbais coast.
In May last year, nearly 100 people died in Cyclone Amphan, the most powerful storm to hit eastern India in more than a decade. It flattened villages, destroyed farms and left millions without power in eastern India and Bangladesh.
Some of the deadliest tropical cyclones on record have occurred in the Bay of Bengal. A 1999 super cyclone killed around 10,000 people and devastated large parts of Odisha. Due to improved forecasts and better coordinated disaster management, the death toll from Cyclone Phailin, an equally intense storm that hit in 2013, was less than 50, according to the World Meteorological Organisation.

LONDON: Antony Sher, one of the most acclaimed Shakespearean actors of his generation, has died aged 72, the Royal Shakespeare Company said on Friday.
Sher had been diagnosed with terminal cancer earlier this year. His husband, Royal Shakespeare Company Artistic Director Gregory Doran, took leave from his job to care for him.
Born in Cape Town, South Africa in 1949, Sher moved to Britain in the late 1960s to study drama. He joined the RSC in 1982 and had a breakthrough role in 1984 as the usurping king in Richard III, which won him a best-actor prize at British theaters Olivier Awards.
He went on to play most of Shakespeare’s meaty male roles, including Falstaff in the Henry IV plays, Leontes in The Winter’s Tale, Shylock in The Merchant of Venice, Iago in Othello and the title characters in Macbeth and King Lear.
Non-Shakespearean roles for the company, based in the Bards hometown of Stratford-upon-Avon, included Willy Loman in Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman and the title role in Moliere’s Tartuffe. Sher also performed with Liverpool’s innovative Everyman Theatre and at many of London’s main theaters, getting his first West End starring role as a drag artist in Harvey Fierstein’s Torch Song Trilogy in 1985. He won a second Olivier, and got a Tony nomination, for playing artist Stanley Spencer in Pam Gems Stanley at the National Theatre and on Broadway.
Sher adapted Primo Levis powerful Auschwitz memoir If This is a Man into a one-man stage show, Primo, that ran on Broadway in 2005. His last role for the RSC was in South African writer John Kanis Kunene and The King, in which Sher played a veteran actor diagnosed with cancer.
Sher’s film roles included Dr. Moth in Shakespeare in Love, Benjamin Disraeli in Mrs Brown and Adolf Hitler in Churchill: The Hollywood Years.
Sher also wrote several novels and theatrical memoirs, along with an autobiography, Beside Myself. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2000.
Shakespeare scholar James Shapiro said Sher’s performances profoundly deepened my understanding of Shakespeare.
He was a brilliant actor and an incredibly kind and thoughtful person, Shapiro said. Hamlet put it best: take him for all in all, I shall not look upon his like again.
Sher and Doran were one of the first couples to have a civil partnership in Britain after same-sex unions were legalized in 2005. They married in 2015 when the U.K. legalized gay marriage.

2,‘Lot of concern’ over Russian military activity near Ukraine: US general,"Significant national security interests of the United States and of Nato member states are at stake, he says.","WASHINGTON: The United States is tracking enough indicators and warnings surrounding Russian military activity near Ukraine to trigger “a lot of concern” and Russian rhetoric appears increasingly strident, the top US military officer said late on Thursday.
Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, declined to speculate about the kinds of options the United States might consider in the event of a Russian invasion. But Milley, in some of his most extensive remarks on the crisis, stressed the importance of Ukraine’s sovereignty to Washington and to the Nato alliance.
“There’s significant national security interests of the United States and of Nato member states at stake here if there was an overt act of aggressive action militarily by the Russians into a nation state that has been independent since 1991,” Milley said during a flight from Seoul to Washington.
Ukraine says Russia has amassed more than 90,000 troops near their long shared border. But Moscow has dismissed suggestions it is preparing for an attack on its southern neighbor and has defended its right to deploy troops on its own territory as it sees fit.
The Kremlin already annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and then backed rebels fighting Kyiv government forces in the east of the country. That conflict has killed 14,000 people, Kyiv says, and is still simmering.
Experts caution that an unchallenged Russian invasion could be destabilizing, creating ripple effects well beyond Ukraine at a time of increasing anxiety over Chinese intentions toward Taiwan.
Milley declined to state publicly his estimate of the number of Russian forces near Ukraine but suggested his concerns went beyond the raw numbers of Russian troops.
“I’m not going to tell you what we track and the indicators or warnings from an intelligence standpoint, but we track them all,” Milley said. “And there’s enough out there now to cause a lot of concern, and we’ll continue to monitor.” Russia and Ukraine have centuries of shared history and formed the two biggest republics of the Soviet Union until its 1991 collapse, so Moscow views its neighbor’s ambition to join Nato as an affront and a threat.
Since the latest crisis started, Moscow has set out demands for legally binding security guarantees from the West, and for assurances that Nato will not admit Ukraine as a member or deploy missile systems there to target Russia.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Moscow on Thursday of “severe costs” if it invaded Ukraine, urging his Russian counterpart to seek a diplomatic exit from the crisis.
Milley declined to speculate whether Russian President Vladimir Putin might be emboldened by US President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from Afghanistan, saying “You’d have to ask Putin.” The August pullout ended America’s two-decade-old war in an unambiguous defeat, with the Taliban returning to power.
“I think it would be a mistake for any country to draw a broad strategic conclusion based on the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and then take that event and automatically apply it to other situations,” Milley said.
He cited historic examples of past US presidents who withdrew troops in some places but ordered military action elsewhere.
“So the United States is a difficult country for other countries to understand sometimes,” he said.

3,Minister quits in bid to defuse Saudi-Lebanon tensions,The resignation may help the French president start a dialogue to help restore Beirut-Riyadh relations.,"BEIRUT: Lebanon’s information minister resigned on Friday, saying he hoped the much anticipated move will open the way for easing an unprecedented diplomatic crisis with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Arab countries. That crisis has added to immense economic troubles facing Lebanon, already mired in a financial meltdown.
Minister George Kordahi, a prominent former game show host, said he took the decision to step down ahead of French President Emmanuel Macron’s visit to Saudi Arabia on Saturday. The resignation, Kordahi said at a press conference in the Lebanese capital, may help Macron start a dialogue to help restore Beirut-Riyadh relations.
The crisis erupted following Kordahi’s televised comments aired in October that were critical of Saudi Arabias war in Yemen. The kingdom recalled its ambassador from Beirut and banned all Lebanese imports in response to Kordahi’s remarks, affecting hundreds of businesses and cutting off hundreds of millions in foreign currency to Lebanon.
The minister said he meant no offense with the comments, made before he was appointed to the Cabinet post, and for weeks refused to resign, prolonging the crisis.
“Lebanon is more important than George Kordahi,” he said at the press conference Friday. I hope that this resignation opens the window for better relations with Gulf Arab countries, he added.
The diplomatic spat over Kordahi has aggravated Lebanon’s economic crisis, the worst in its modern history. The countrys financial meltdown, coupled with multiple other crises, has plunged more than three quarters of the nation’s population of 6 million, including a million Syrian refugees, into poverty.
Prime Minister Najib Mikati welcomed Kordahis resignation, saying it was necessary and could open the door for tackling the problem with the brothers in the kingdom and the Gulf nations.” The standoff with Saudi Arabia, a traditional backer of the small Mediterranean country, has further paralysed Lebanon’s government, which has been unable to convene since Oct. 12 amid reports that ministers allied with Hezbollah would resign if Kordahi goes.
The Saudi measures have caused anxiety, particularly among the many Lebanese who work in the Gulf Arab countries, and added to the countrys economic woes. It is not clear whether Kordahis resignation would placate Saudi Arabia enough to reverse its decisions and prevent further escalation, or whether it would open the door for Lebanese Cabinet meetings to resume.
Lebanon’s government is embroiled in another crisis triggered when the country’s Iran-backed militant Hezbollah group protested the course of the state’s investigation into the massive Beirut port explosion last year.
Hezbollah has criticised Tarek Bitar, the judge leading the investigation, saying his probe was politicised, and called on the government to ensure his removal. Local media reported there were mediations to trade Bitar’s removal from the probe with Kordahi’s resignation.
Kordahi’s resignation comes ahead of Macron’s visit to Riyadh on Saturday. Macron backs Mikatis government and has taken the lead among the international community in helping the small Mideast country, a former French protectorate.
“I understood that the French want my resignation before Macron visits Riyadh, which would help, maybe in opening the way for dialogue,” Kordahi said.

4,Austria’s ruling party names new chancellor,"VIENNA: Austria’s ruling party nominated Interior Minister Karl Nehammer on Friday to lead the country, hoping to...","VIENNA: Austria’s ruling party nominated Interior Minister Karl Nehammer on Friday to lead the country, hoping to draw a line under corruption allegations that cost Sebastian Kurz the top job two months ago.
Kurz, one of Europe’s youngest leaders long seen as a “whizz kid” until graft claims brought him down in October, announced on Thursday he was leaving politics to spend time with his newborn.
To distance itself from the scandal that has engulfed Kurz, the conservative Peoples Party (OeVP) replaced several key positions on Friday.
Alexander Schallenberg, who took over from Kurz as chancellor in October, is set to return to the foreign ministry.
The president is expected to accept Nehammer’s nomination and set a date for the swearing-in.
“It is a big honour for me to get this vote of confidence,” Nehammer told reporters, adding it was a “privilege” to be chosen to lead the party and country.
Nehammer said his new team would continue to fight the fallout from the coronavirus “and get back our freedoms”.
Austria has imposed a three-week partial lockdown since late last month to rein in spiralling virus infection numbers.
With Nehammer, Austria will have had five different chancellors since 2016 in years of unusual political 
volatility under conservative leadership in the Alpine EU member.
Analyst Thomas Hofer said it was uncertain if the conservative-Green coalition, in power since early 2020, would see through its full mandate until 2024.

5,Council of Europe to take action against Turkey over jailed activist,"The activist, Osman Kavala, has now been in jail for over four years without ever being convicted of a crime.","STRASBOURG: The Council of Europe said on Friday it will launch disciplinary action against Turkey for refusing to free prominent activist and philanthropist Osman Kavala, triggering a procedure used only once before in the organisation’s history. 
The pan-European rights body’s committee of ministers agreed the move over Turkey’s repeated refusal to comply with a 2019 ruling by the European Court of Human Rights to release Kavala from jail. 
It comes as concern grows over rights abuses in Turkey under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The Turkish leader has repeatedly targeted Kavala, who has now been in jail for over four years without ever being convicted of a crime. 
“By failing to ensure the applicant’s immediate release, the committee considers that Turkey is refusing to abide by the court’s final judgement in this case,” the COE said. 
The Turkish foreign ministry had urged the COE on Thursday not to begin the action “out of respect for the ongoing judicial process”, warning that the procedure would be “interference” in its domestic affairs. 
Amnesty International’s Europe Director Nils Muiznieks welcomed the message to Turkey as “crystal clear” and said Kavala’s situation was “an unacceptable breach of the country’s human rights obligations”. 
Aisling Reidy, senior legal adviser at Human Rights Watch, added that the move was the “right course”, saying the near unprecedented nature of the action was an “acknowledgement of Turkey’s rule of law crisis”. 
This is only the second time the COE has used its so-called infringement proceedings against one of its 47 member states, the first occasion being a 2017 action against Azerbaijan over its refusal to release dissident Ilgar Mammadov. 
Mammadov was then released from jail in August 2018 and the proceedings ultimately were closed. 
The procedure was created in 2010 to ensure full compliance with ECHR rulings, which are legally binding for COE member states. 
The decision by the committee of ministers, which required a two-thirds majority, puts Turkey under formal notice that its failure to release Kavala will be referred back to the ECHR. 
Turkey has a deadline of January 19 by which to respond, after which the committee would refer the case back to the ECHR at its next meeting on February 2. 
The ECHR will then decide whether Turkey’s non-implementation of its 2019 ruling represents a further violation. 
The next hearing in Kavala’s case in Istanbul is scheduled for January 17. 
“This decision is a strong tool that needs to be used by all relevant actors to increase pressure on Turkey to end its problematic human rights practices,” said Ayse Bingol Demir, co-director of the Turkey Litigation Support Project. 
The COE’s statute allows for the suspension of a member state’s voting rights, or even expulsion as an ultimate sanction. The process, however, is still far from reaching this stage. 
The jailing of Kavala has become one of the most emblematic cases in Turkey under Erdogan, who has dominated the country for the last two decades but is now battling a severe economic crisis.

6,UAE places biggest order for French warplanes,Also inks an order for 12 Caracal military transport helicopters for a total bill of more than 17 billion euros.,"DUBAI: The United Arab Emirates signed a record 14-billion-euro contract for 80 Rafale warplanes and committed billions of euros in other deals as French President Emmanuel Macron kicked off a Gulf tour on Friday.
The biggest international order ever made for the French jets came as Macron held talks with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed at the start of a two-day trip which will also take in Qatar and Saudi Arabia.
The resource-rich UAE, one of the French defence industry’s biggest customers, also inked an order for 12 Caracal military transport helicopters for a total bill of more than 17 billion euros.

Macron starts Gulf tour

“French engagement in the region, active cooperation in the fight against terrorism and the clear positions we have taken have allowed us to grow closer with the United Arab Emirates,” Macron told journalists in Dubai.
“And at a time when questions are being asked about other long-term partners, I think this reinforces the position of France,” he added, describing France as a “solid” and “trustworthy” ally that “sticks to its commitments”.
Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala sovereign wealth fund also pledged eight billion euros in investments in French businesses, while the licence of the UAE capital’s branch of the Louvre art gallery was extended for 10 years to 2047.
The Emirates was the fifth biggest customer for the French defence industry with 4.7 billion euros from 2011-2020, according to a parliamentary report.
France has faced criticism after some of these weapons were used during the UAE’s engagement in Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition is fighting Iran-backed rebels in a war that has created one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.
‘Historic contract’
The Rafale order, signed on Friday while Macron met with Sheikh Mohammed at Dubai’s Expo site, is the biggest made internationally for the Dassault Aviation aircraft since it entered service in 2004.
It follows the collapse of a multibillion-dollar submarine deal with Australia in September that left Paris fuming after Canberra negotiated a new defence pact with London and Washington.
French Defence Minister Florence Parly called it a “historic contract” which will contribute “directly to regional stability”. The F4 model Rafales, currently under development, will be delivered from 2027.
“This is an outcome of the strategic partnership between the two countries, consolidating their capacity to act together for their autonomy and security,” the French presidency said in a statement.
By snapping up the fighter aircraft the UAE is eclipsing the fleets of Gulf rival Qatar, which has bought 36 of the planes, and Egypt which ordered 24 in 2015 and 30 earlier this year.

7,"Talks on Iran N-deal pause, to resume next week",BERLIN: Diplomats negotiating in Vienna to revive Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers have paused after ...,"BERLIN: Diplomats negotiating in Vienna to revive Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers have paused after five days of talks to consult their governments and will reconvene next week, officials said on Friday.
The European Union official chairing the meeting said there had been some progress, but further convergence was necessary.
“We have identified the challenges ahead. Now it is time to consult with capitals,” EU diplomat Enrique Mora told reporters. “We will be resuming here in Vienna next week.”
“We have substantial challenges ahead, time is not unlimited, there is an obvious sense of urgency,” he added. “But above all we need a certain convergence of policy to start negotiations.”
The so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, has effectively been on life support since the United States pulled out under then-President Donald Trump’s maximum pressure campaign against Tehran in 2018.
The remaining signatories to the nuclear deal Iran, Russia, China, France, Germany and Britain have been meeting at the Palais Coburg, a luxury hotel where the agreement was signed six years ago. The accord strictly limited Iran’s enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.
A US delegation headed by the Biden administrations special envoy for Iran, Robert Malley, was staying at a nearby hotel and being briefed on the talks by diplomats from the other countries.
Mora said reviving the agreement would require Iran to meet its commitments under the accord, and bringing the United States back into full compliance,” meaning Washington would need to drop the crippling economic sanctions it imposed on Tehran.
Asked what had been achieved this week, Mora said there had been progress in the sense that we have had a new Iranian delegation, they have engaged in negotiations with other delegations.
“We are incorporating also new policy sensitivities for the new Iranian delegations,” he said. “But again, the point of departure, the common ground is where we finished at the last round of talks, in June.”
The nuclear deal saw Iran limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. Since the deals collapse, Iran now enriches small amounts of uranium up to 60 per cent purity a short step from weapons-grade levels of 90pc. Iran also spins advanced centrifuges barred by the accord, and its uranium stockpile now far exceeds the accords limits.
On Wednesday, the International Atomic Energy Agency that monitors the Islamic republic’s nuclear programme said Iran has begun steps to enrich uranium at an underground nuclear facility in Fordo where it was meant to halt all enrichment up to 20pc purity.
Iran maintains its atomic programme is peaceful, but US intelligence agencies and international inspectors say Iran had an organised nuclear weapons programme up until 2003.
IAEA inspectors are unable to fully monitor Iran’s programme because Tehran has limited their access to its sites.
The Iranian delegation, appointed by new Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, this week called for the US to unfreeze $10 billion in assets as an initial goodwill gesture.

Protesters got past security to enter the grounds of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in The Hague and staged a noisy rally outside the building’s front doors.
Police dragged the demonstrators off one by one, put them on the ground and handcuffed them. Some were bundled into waiting vans, but the large number meant many were taken away in a hired bus.
At least a dozen police vehicles sealed off the road outside the OPCW, which is opposite Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte’s official residence. Several ambulances and a medical helicopter were also at the scene.
“Around 50 demonstrators have been arrested and transferred to a police location,” a spokesman for The Hague police said.
Britain’s delegation at the body said it was “deeply concerned to see protesters break into (the) OPCW” and thanked police for the “swift response”.
It said evidence on chemical weapons used “should be submitted to OPCW through appropriate channels.” Turkey denies using chemical weapons in its conflict with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which has been waging an insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984.
