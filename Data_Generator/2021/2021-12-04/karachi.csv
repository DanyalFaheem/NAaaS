0,FP winter gala — fashion’s night out,KARACHI: Fashion designers and their muses have taken over the Fashion Pakistan (FP) Council-based FP Winter Gala ...,"KARACHI: Fashion designers and their muses have taken over the Fashion Pakistan (FP) Council-based FP Winter Gala red carpet, posing and giving interviews to host Anoushay Ashraf in a kaleidoscopic display of fashion hungama with photographers, bloggers and social media creators and influencers frenzily clicking away at the fashion imagery on offer, something that had all but vanished in these crazy and uncertain Covid-19-infested times.
Away from the hullabaloo of the lounge and the red carpet, matters inside the ramp area set-up in the hall of the Beach Luxury Hotel on Thursday were much calmer and streamlined as ushers saw the fashionistas to their name-tagged front-row seats, providing them an excellent view and a vantage point to witness the live fashion unfolding before their very eyes, while the other invitees and guests weaved their way between aisles to their seats in the rows further away from the runway.
A hushed silence always descends on the show area just before the opening act in anticipation of the fashion drama about to unfold on the ramp. No doubt, for the runway is a place of revere for those directly associated with the business and true meaning of fashion. It’s an awe-inspiring moment when a designer’s vision what fashion is to him/her, materialises right in front of your very eyes, and irrespective of the fact whether it’s a hit or a miss, it’s still breathtaking to behold and demands the respect of serious fashion-mongers and movers and shakers of the style and fashion industry. 
Once the shows are under way, with designers rolling out back-to-back ensembles on lithe, sinewy and fashion-savvy models from the hidden confines of the backstage where every possible kind of mayhem and frenzy may ensue, it’s easy for onlookers to get carried away in the romanticism, tempo and fervour until the very last of the models exit the ramp and make their way backstage, only to return for the designer’s curtain call as confetti cannons and sparklers spew their content at the edge of the runway. The imagery is a staple at all fashion shows and weeks, one that has been sorely missed during the coronavirus pandemic-hit times, while trapped within the confines of locked doors at homes.
Six designers showcased at the FP Winter Gala with Maheen Khan opening the show with her sleek-looking collection bearing her tell-tale signature look by coupling elegance and style with comfort. Black button-down shirts in pastels and truck art-inspired saris and sari dresses paired with tastefully embellished tulip pants and smartly crafted tops mostly defined the collection. The segment featured handbags by Jafferjees.
Zaaviay’s ‘New Dawn’ with its seemingly over-the-top and gawdily embellished outfits appeared extremely confused in its style aesthetics. It put everything bling-worthy on the ramp and yet nothing exceptionally noteworthy stood out.
Menswear designer Sameer Sain put a twist on suits in terms of texture, self-prints and accessories which worked more oft than not. The fur and fur-lined jacket look may have been a wee bit extreme but if making a style statement was on the designer’s mind at the time of conceiving the collection, then it was a triumph.
Hina Mirza’s urban wardrobe in chequered flannel prints with lace trimmings around the wrists and army camp boots captured the essence of youthful rebellion against the norm, and made a definite city girl style statement. Even her crisp cotton numbers in muted tones stood out for sheer ingenuity and urban appeal.
Aamna Aqeel’s totally western wacky silhouettes seemed a little rough around the edges but the more simplistic cuts hinted at flashes of master craftsmanship. The parrot green and canary yellow numbers stood out among all the rest. The simpler, the better was the way to go for this collection. Better luck to the designer next time though.
Zohaib Jubileo’s bespoke menswear stuck to kurta pajamas with high-waisted jackets and the more traditional front open sherwani cuts. A few pieces here and there experimented with individuality and freedom of artistic expression. Overall, not a bad runway debut.
Arizai by Atiya, and what she termed as spiritual fashion, had monk capes and black and beige tops with seemingly spiritual embroidered motifs which really didn’t do much for the collection, or for the designer for that matter. Playing it this safe is never a good idea, especially for the finale show.
The make-up and hairstyling of the models for the FP Gala was by Nabila’s and N-Gents with media management and coordination by Faisal Kapadia.

1,14th International Urdu Conference to begin next week,KARACHI: The 14th edition of the International Urdu Conference organised by the Arts Council of Pakistan will begin...,"KARACHI: The 14th edition of the International Urdu Conference organised by the Arts Council of Pakistan will begin on Dec 9 and conclude on Dec 12, said  council’s president Ahmed Shah on Friday.
Mr Shah told a presser that this year unfortunately quite a few scholars have left this world, such as Shamsur Rehman Farooqui and Prof Shamim Hanfi. Despite that, the organisers have tried to include as many renowned names of Urdu literature as speakers at the event. 
“Since we’re also starting the 75th Independence Day celebrations of the country, this year’s theme is celebrating independence and cultural diversity. This is the reason why for the last three years we’ve been discussing other Pakistani languages — Sindhi, Punjabi, Balochi, Saraeki and Pashto — as well which has received a very good feedback.”
After saying that, he introduced to the media the sponsors for the year’s edition. Coming back to the content of the programme, Mr Shah said the conference has assumed great significance over the years, so much so that Urdu writers all over the world eagerly look forward to it. 
“The conference begins on Dec 9. Its inaugural session will be held at 3.30pm. The chief minister of Sindh will be the chief guest for the opening session. This will be followed by Shaam-i-Faiz in which poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s daughter Moniza Hashmi, his grandson Adeel Hashmi and poet Iftikhar Arif will take part. The traditional subjects are there as well. This time round, though, we have kept a separate panel discussion on the novel, as are on the art of short story (afasana), criticism, ghazal and nazm. 
“Then each time a big question that is put to us is about our Indian participants. Indian border is closed and the visa facility is unavailable. But the good thing that has come out of it is that earlier a few people from across the border would take part in the event, now, since through the digital media we can be viewed in all parts of the globe, there is a bigger number of guest speakers from India. For example, Gopichand Narang will grace the inaugural session. Gulzar, Javed Siddiqui and Anees Ashfaq will also be there.

2,PPP govt extends dialogue offer to opposition on LG law,"Bilawal wants stakeholders consulted; health, education can be returned to LGs.","• Bilawal wants stakeholders consulted 
• Health, education can be returned to LGs
• Minister says next Karachi mayor to head KWSB
• SHOs to be made answerable to UC chairmen
KARACHI: While all the opposition parties irrespective of their representation in the Sindh Assembly have been opposing the recently passed Sindh Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2021, the beleaguered Pakistan Peoples Party government in a damage control move expressed its readiness to hold negotiation with the opposition to “further improve the process to amend” the LG law on Friday.
“The Sindh government is fully ready to negotiate with the opposition parties to further improve the process to amend the provincial local government law...the amended LG law is not at all a holy scripture that cannot be further amended or improved,” Sindh Information Minister Saeed Ghani said.
At a press conference here, Information Minister Ghani and LG Minister Nasir Shah also clarified that the PPP-led government had made a move to assume control of health and educational facilities of local governments for the sole purpose to upgrade their standard, but it was ready to cede their control if it was the demand of the opposition that the municipal agencies continued to manage these public facilities.
However, they said that majority of the suggestions forwarded by opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan and Jamaat-i-Islami had been incorporated in the newly passed Sindh Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2021.
Mr Ghani said that the provincial government had agreed to revive the town system for municipal governance in Karachi after the major opposition parties in the province had given the suggestions to this effect.
He said that Pakistan Peoples Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had also given special instructions that the relevant stakeholders should be consulted to take their suggestions into account while improving the LG set-up of the province.
He said the provincial authorities were more than willing to hold talks with the opposition on the contentious issues related to the LG bill including the use of secret ballot for electing mayor and chairmen and the control of local schools and hospitals.
Next mayor to head KWSB: Ghani
The information minister said that similarly talks could also be held to further empower the elected mayor or chairmen in the LG set-up so that they could play a role in the civic agencies like Karachi Water & Sewerage Board (KWSB), Sindh Solid Waste Management Board (SSWMB), and Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA).
He said that the provincial government had decided to make next Karachi mayor the chairman of KWSB to empower the elected LG representatives.
LG Minister Nasir Shah said that the elected local government representatives would head the SSWMB once it was devolved to the divisional level for formation of new citywide trash disposal agencies.
He said the union committees / councils after amendments to the provincial LG law would continue to issue the birth/death certificates as was the case in the previous municipal system. This work had been linked with the National Database and Registration Authority to make it error-free, he said.
He said that UC chairmen were going to get the powers to supervise the affairs of government-run schools and hospitals in their respective jurisdiction.
He said the provincial government had planned to amend the Police Act to make area SHOs answerable to UC chairmen by submitting his monthly progress report to the elected LG representative, who would also convey his suggestions and reservations on the law and order issues. “Similar powers will also be available to the elected mayor and town chairmen,’ he added.

3,Asad Umar says K-IV project to be completed in 22 months,Five 84-inch mild steel pipes to carry total 650 MGD.,"KARACHI: Work to construct the Greater Karachi Water Supply Scheme, commonly known as K-IV project, will start in next three to four months and likely to be completed by October 2023, said a senior member of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government on Friday.
Federal Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Asad Umar chaired a meeting in Islamabad to review the progress of the mega project, which had recently been taken over by the federal government from the Sindh government.
Additional secretary-development Abdul Aziz Uqaili, project director Amir Mughal, and project consultants Dr Bashir Lakhani and senior officials attended the meeting.
“The project director briefed the minister about the revised PC-1 of the K-IV project, its components, and design details,” said a statement issued after the meeting.

Five 84-inch mild steel pipes to carry total 650 MGD

“It was informed in the meeting that Wapda has completed the revised design of 650 MGD K-IV to be executed in phases. All planning, design, and procurement activities are as per the project timeline, and the construction of this project will be completed by October 2023,” it added.
The federal minister also advised the officials to ensure uninterrupted power supply to operate pumping stations and to supply water to the proposed reservoirs.
The project director informed him that the design of the K-IV project had been developed with a modular approach in which five pumping stations with as many large mild steel pipes of 84 inches each carrying 130 MGD with a total capacity of 650 MGD had been planned to be executed.
The meeting was informed that Wapda has submitted PC-1 with a modified design of 650 MGD K-IV Project with various options for execution of the project, which can be done in phases.
Mr Umar directed the Planning Division to expedite processing of the revised PC-1 to get it approved as early as possible from Central Development Working Party (CDWP) and Executive Committee of National Economic Council (Ecnec).
The minister expressed satisfaction over the pace of the progress and work on the development of revised planning and design of this project which is in line with the prime minister’s commitment to ensuring water availability to residents of Karachi.
Last month, Wapda chairman retired Lt Gen Muzammil Hussain had visited the project site.
The multibillion-rupee scheme was meant to meet the water needs of Karachiites but it remains a distant dream even after more than 10 years of its formal launch in 2011.
Multiple causes delayed its completion and increased the estimated cost to Rs150bn. The federal government had finally taken over the project from the provincial government.

4,Murad says differently-abled persons’ seats to be reserved in LBs,Launches ConnectHear App through which persons with hearing imparity will be able to communicate,"KARACHI: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Friday said that his government was planning to reserve seats of persons with disabilities in local bodies so that they could participate in decision-making process at the local level. 
“I am keen to invest in the rehabilitation of differently-abled persons by establishing units in every district, but I need devoted, dedicated and God-fearing volunteers because this selfless service needs to be done with affection, personal care and love,” he said while speaking at a programme on International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
The programme was organised by the provincial department of empowerment of persons with disabilities (DEPD) at the CM House. It was attended by Sindh Minister Sajid Jokhio, Parliamentary Secretary Kulsoom Chandio, Special Assistant Sadiq Memon, and members of civil society and NGOs working for rehabilitation of differently-abled persons. 
The CM said there was a dire need to work for rehabilitation of differently-abled persons all over Sindh. 

Launches ConnectHear App through which persons with hearing imparity will be able to communicate

Offers support to ‘genuine’ organisations
“The provincial government is ready to support genuine organisations to establish autism centres, rehabilitation units for persons with mental health conditions, intellectual disabilities, vision impairment and deafness,” he said, adding: “This is a very sensitive work which could not be done merely with funds... it was done with personal care, love, affection and dedication.” 
He said his representatives/ministers who worked for the empowerment of differently-abled persons had completely changed in their day-to-day life and in their approach to handling things. “The service to the persons with disabilities has given them [ministers] a spiritual satisfaction and the same satisfaction I have witnessed among the teachers, trainers, physiotherapists and volunteers serving to them [special persons],” he said. 
Mr Shah said that when he took over as chief minister, there was a department of special education with some schools where enrolment was very thin. “I have created a fully fledged department of empowerment of persons with disabilities which has over 60 centres, some of them were devolved by the federal government to the provincial government,” he said. 
“We have worked on every kind of disabled person to bring them into the mainstream,” he said and added that he would further strengthen the newly-established Sujawal rehabilitation centre. 
Efforts on for 5pc job quota
The CM said his government had enacted different laws to provide legal cover for the proper care, education, rehabilitation, and vocational training of the persons with disabilities. “I am trying my best to implement a five per cent quota of differently-abled persons in government jobs,” he said. 
On the occasion, children with special needs of different centres of many cities and NGOs staged tableaus and national songs. A one-act play was also staged to observe the day. 
On the occasion, ConnectHear App was formally launched through which persons with hearing imparity would be able to communicate. Presently, 3,000 persons were using the application. 
A unified sign language with 4,000 words was also inaugurated and Language Act of 2018 Rules 2021 was also inaugurated in Braille Language. 
Special Assistant to CM Sadiq Memon said his department had started registering persons with disabilities and so far 245,000 persons had been registered. 
“The registration is being carried out so that necessary schemes for their rehabilitation can be made,” he said.

6,PTI challenges new local government bill in SHC,"Petitioners state the amendment bill is in violation of Articles 7, 8, 17, 32 and 140-A of the Constitution.","KARACHI: The opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf on Friday filed a petition in the Sindh High Court challenging the recently passed Sindh Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2021.
PTI leaders Haleem Adil Sheikh, who is also the leader of the opposition in the provincial assembly, and MPA Khurram Sher Zaman, through their counsel, moved the SHC stating that the impugned bill passed to make amendments in the Sindh Local Government Act (SLGA), 2013 was in violation of several constitutional provisions and against the fundamental rights of citizens.
The petitioners asserted that the bill would not only usurp the authority of local governments about health, education, issuance of various certificates, control of land owned by municipal bodies and other fundamental functions but would also introduce dubious amendments paving the way for horse-trading in the election of unelected persons as mayor or chairman.
They cited the chief secretary, provincial secretaries of local government and law departments, speaker and secretary of the Sindh Assembly and chief election commissioner as respondents.
They submitted in the petition that the amendment bill was in violation of Articles 7, 8, 17, 32 and 140-A of the Constitution and pleaded to declare it as null and void and restrain the respondents from enactment and promulgation of the bill as an Act.
Speaking to media persons on the SHC premises, the PTI leaders were of the view that the Sindh government had intended to deprive the local governments of powers, responsibilities and functions guaranteed under the Constitution as Article 140-A required devolution of financial, administrative and political authority to the local government system.
However, they said that the provincial government had centralised all the powers instead of devolving the same to the third tier of the government and besides in violation of various constitutional provisions, they were of the opinion that the bill was also contradictory to laws against the spirit of democracy and an attempt to exert absolute authority of provincial government on local bodies in Sindh.
The PTI leaders maintained that the bill was passed in haste while suppressing rules which required providing a draft bill to elected members a couple of days before its introduction in the house and discussion in the standing committee concerned, but it was tabled and got approved within an hour.
While expressing concerns over introduction of secret balloting for the election of mayor and chairman, they said that it would open the door to horse-trading.
An identical petition was also filed by the Pak Sarzameen Party in the SHC a couple of days ago.

8,Police authorities must explain extrajudicial killings: SHRC,HYDERABAD: Sindh Human Rights Commission (SHRC) chairperson retired Justice Majida Rizvi on Friday observed that...,"HYDERABAD: Sindh Human Rights Commission (SHRC) chairperson retired Justice Majida Rizvi on Friday observed that police in Sindh were committing extrajudicial killings. Police authorities must be asked to offer explanation on this issue, she said.
Justice Rizvi was speaking at a convention organised by the Sindh Human Rights Defenders (SHRD) at the local press club.
Chairing the convention, Justice Rizvi said the SHRC was the first independent commission formed for the protection of human rights.
She said when her commission would start holding inquiries into alleged extrajudicial killings, the number of such incidents would automatically drop. She said the commission was working on curbing underage marriage issues. Many such marriages were stopped after the commission’s intervention, he pointed out.
Office-bearers of the SHRD, speaking at the convention, urged government to provide protection to its activists. They condemned the alleged murders of Nazim Jokhio, journalists Ajay Lalwani and Aziz Memon and Sindh Bar Council secretary Advocate Irfan Mahar in different incidents in Sindh.
Sindh Commission on Status of Women (SCSW) chairperson Nuzhat Shireen told the audience that her organisation was conducting a research on how to stop violence against women. She said it always stood by rights defenders, who were also striving for the protection of women’s rights.
She said that her organisation was also looking into the murders and human rights issues of serious nature. She said the SCSW took up women rights cases on a priority basis. Women rights activists would have to be empowered and protected, she added.
SHRD coordinator Ali Palh said that the activists making efforts for the protection of human rights, women’s rights and minority’s rights in Sindh needed to be officially provided safety and security. 
Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) Sindh leader Imdad Chandio said that police had become “a tool of powerful forces” and people were being killed in cold blood. 
He also noted with concern that millions of people were being rendered homeless in the name of anti-encroachment drive. Haris were still facing bonded labour whereas oppressive treatment on the part of moneylenders in Tharparkar was compelling poor people to commit suicide.

9,MQM-P says new amendments will make LGs powerless,"Vows to launch struggle for rights, separate province","HYDERABAD: Muttahida  Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) on Friday held a protest demonstration  outside the Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (HMC) building against  amendments to the local government law and vowed to take the protest to  every road and street in Sindh.
Speaking to the  participants, the party’s deputy convener Kanwar Naveed Jamil said that  the amendments were aimed at rendering local government institutions  powerless, and regretted that the higher authorities and judiciary were  not taking notice of the excesses let loose by the ruling Pakistan  Peoples Party in the province.
“The biased PPP government  is not ready to devolve powers to LG institutions and empower those  whose forefathers had created this country.” he said.
He noted with concern that employees of the HMC were not being paid their salaries.

Vows to launch struggle for rights, separate province 

“Sindh  government gets Rs1,400bn from cities while Rs700-750bn collected by  federal government from residents of major cities is transferred to the  province. Despite this massive funding, Sindh government is not ready to  address people’s issues of minor nature.
Mr Jamil pointed out  that the water filtration plants built during his tenure as district  nazim in this city had still remained dysfunctional and people were made  to consume filth-mixed water. He said road infrastructure, parks and  playgrounds in Hyderabad were in a shabby condition. He said that the  institutions collecting revenues were already under the control of Sindh  government and now, through amendments to the LG law, it was going to  take control of hospitals and schools run by local government.
“This  is being done by PPP to deprive people of their right to employment and  earn money to stash it in foreign accounts through corruption. PPP  wants to control budget of LG institutions,” Mr Jamil alleged. He also  accused the ruling party of buying votes through corruption.
The  MQM-P deputy convener said that his party had a grievance against  institutions. “PPP is committing atrocities against children of founders  of Pakistan but these institutions are not taking cognizance of it. Our  petition regarding important issues is also pending in supreme court  but it is not being taken up,” he said.
He deplored that  fake domiciles were issued in this government to deprive residents of  urban centres of job opportunities. People from other districts were  recruited in Karachi and Hyderabad on such fake domicile. “Urdu-speaking  youths do not get jobs in provincial departments, including police,” he  added.
The MQM-P leader asked the Urdu-speaking community to  decide whether it would bear with a life of slavery or like to get its  youths the right to education, employment and due facilities. “We [the  community] will have to come out of our houses to get our due rights. We  will not tolerate these excesses any longer. We will launch a struggle  for the rights and get a separate province created,” he said.
He  said his party did not need ‘favour’ from national institutions but  justice. He called for holding the PPP government accountable. 
MQM-P coordination committee members Dr Zafar Kamali,  Sohail Mash’hadi, MPAs Rashid Khilji and Nasir Qureshi also spoke.

The call for the protest was given by JI’s Sindh emir Mohammad Hussain Mahanti.
The demonstration was led by JI district emir Aqeel Ahmed Khan along with other leaders including Abdul Waheed Qureshi and Tahir Majeed. 
Speaking to the participants, Aqeel Khan termed the bill ‘black law’, and condemned that the Sindh government of PPP snatched local governments’ powers of issuing birth and death certificate. 
He said hospitals, dispensaries, primary education, basic health centres and vaccination centres would also be controlled by provincial government under the proposed law.
The JI leaders stressed that local government should be given more powers instead of rendering them powerless. They said that all local governments in big cities of the province should be given powers to build roads and lay drainage and sewerage lines. 
LGs should also be given powers to control police, land management, transport, education and health institutions of their respective areas so that people’s issues could be addressed at their doorstep.
They said that the party that claims to be ‘champion of democracy’ was in fact ‘murderer of democracy’. They said the local government bill was ‘unconstitutional’, and accused PPP government of destroying LGs. 
MIRPURKHAS: Scores of JI activists belonging to its Mirpurkhas chapter took part in a demonstration held outside Madina Masjid after Juma prayers here to against introduction of the LG law amendment bill. 
Led by JI’s Mirurkhas district emir Haji Noor Illahi Mughal and Abdul Rasheed, the activists carrying banners and placards raised slogans against the PPP government. 
They condemned its “anti-people acts” and said that instead of providing any relief to the masses, PPP was bent upon oppressing them. 
They warned it of public outrage if it did not refrain from snatching due powers from LGs and depriving people of the easy access to the institution in getting their problems resolved.
They demanded the higher authorities to take notice of the anti-LGs moves being resorted to by the Sindh government. The judiciary should take punitive action against those with mala fide abuse of their powers and positions. 
The JI leaders urged the federal government to take appropriate measures to foil PPP’s designs.

Speaking at a press conference at their local office in Latifabad on Friday, PSP vice chairman Hafeezuddin advocate, Hyderabad division president Nadeem Qazi, Shoaib Jafri and others said that PPP had been ruling over Sindh for the past 13 years and it had always misused resources.
Hafeezuddin advocate alleged that PPP had stomached Rs10bn funds during its rule over Sindh. Through the controversial legislation on the LG law, rights of cities had again been snatched. The same had been done previously as well, he said, adding that the LG law in existence before the amendments was also controversial.
He noted that LGs-run hospitals in Karachi were being controlled by provincial government through the law. Now after these amendments, the authority to issue even birth and death certificates would shift to Sindh government from union councils. He said that tax collection rights of UCs had also been withdrawn by Sindh government.
Mr Hafeezuddin said that PPP wanted to occupy the city through the new law which was not acceptable. He said the PSP was contacting other parties and moving court in this regard.
He supported municipal workers’ protest in Sindh and asked the provincial government to resolve their issue on a priority basis. He deplored that no project in Sindh was completed on time. Many college projects in Karachi also remained incomplete and the funds were stomached. “PPP has the expertise in looting funds ... it has no match with PML-N and PTI,” he remarked, and stressed that powers be devolved at grass root level. Otherwise, the country could not progress, he added.
The PSP leader said Sindh government was targeting Karachi and Hyderabad. Initially employment was snatched, then education was destroyed and now it wanted to shelve Hyderabad’s medical college project. This project was to be completed with Rs400m after having been started at an estimated cost of Rs40m, he said.
He said his party rejected the LG system PPP wanted to thrust upon people. He argued that under the amended law, 48pc strength of LGs would comprise unelected people and the mayor and deputy mayor would be elected through secret ballot. “Everyone knows how in Senate poll the majority was converted to minority. Same model would be applied now in the LG polls and favourites would be got elected using money and other resources,” he said.
Hafeezuddin advocate said that his party was coordinating with PML-N president Shahbaz Sharif, PML-Q leader Chaudhry Pervez Ellahi and JI Emir Sirajul Haq in this regard.
