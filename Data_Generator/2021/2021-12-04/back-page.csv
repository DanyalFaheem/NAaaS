0,AGP asks Rana Shamim to arrange delivery of affidavit at embassy,Suggests photocopy of affidavit be made in presence of Shamim's representative and signed by him.,"ISLAMABAD: Attorney General of Pakistan (AGP) Khalid Jawed Khan asked Rana Shamim, the former chief judge of Gilgit-Baltistan, on Friday to arrange the delivery of his ‘original affidavit’ to the Pakistan High Commission in London. 
The publication of the ex-judge’s purported affidavit in The News last month kicked up a political storm as it claimed that former chief justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar had asked a judge of the Islamabad High Court to ensure that Nawaz Sharif and his daughter were not released from jail before the 2018 general election. 
The Islamabad High Court (IHC) is due to resume on Dec 7 a contempt hearing arising out of the newspaper report against Rana Shamim, editor-in-chief of Jang Group Mir Shakeelur Rehman, Aamir Ghouri, the editor of The News, and Ansar Abbasi, who authored the report.
In his one-page letter, the AGP asked Rana Shamim to arrange the delivery of his affidavit to the Pakistan High Commission in London “at the earliest” so that it could be forwarded to the IHC registrar through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The High Court had observed that in case the original affidavit was not produced on the due date, it would raise an assumption of its non-existence.
The AGP forwarded a copy of his letter to Pakistan’s Foreign Secretary and the country’s High Commissioner in London.
Attorney General Khalid Jawed Khan suggested that, to remove any doubt, a photocopy of the affidavit be made in the presence of his (Rana Shamim’s) representative in London and signed by him. This should be retained in a sealed envelope at the Pakistan high commission.
At the least hearing on Nov 30, Rana Shamim had appeared in person before the Islamabad High Court and sought time for submitting his reply to the show cause notice, but denied that he had provided a copy of his affidavit to any individual because the document executed by him was sealed and had been kept in a locker in the United Kingdom.
The IHC observed that it appeared as if Rana Shamim was not sure about the contents of the purported affidavit or the document. The court asked him to ensure that the sealed affidavit was not seen by anyone else.
The show cause notice, the high court order said, had been issued and received by Rana Shamim and directed him to submit his written reply within four days and produce the original affidavit.
The court asked the AGP to assist Rana Shamim in bringing the affidavit from the United Kingdom. The Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Pakistan High Commission were asked to assist the AGP.
Initiating the contempt proceedings, the IHC had noted that Rana Shamim was appointed as Chief Judge of the Supreme Appellate Court of Gilgit Baltistan in 2015. The judge asserts to have overheard a conversation of Justice Saqib Nisar, the former chief justice of Pakistan, in July 2018, the Islamabad Islamabad High Court said.
The allegations made in the purported affidavit amounted to a grave misconduct, the IHC observed, adding that it was the duty of Rana Shamim to have immediately reported the matter to the Supreme Judicial Council because he himself was holding a responsible judicial office. 
The court held that inaction on the part of Rana Shamim and his subsequent conduct were unbecoming of a judicial officer and raised questions about his bona fides and integrity.
The purported affidavit was not part of any judicial proceedings, the high court said, adding that it related to appeals pending before it.
The news report and the purported affidavit cast “scandalous aspersions on the integrity, independence and impartiality” of the IHC and its judges, the court stated. The alleged contemnors attempted to undermine public confidence in the impartiality and independence of the high court and its judges, the IHC said.

1,"Women shouldn’t be forced into marriage, says Taliban decree",Two leading Afghan women praise the move...,"ISLAMABAD: Afghanistan’s Tali­ban regime on Friday released a dec­ree on women’s rights which said wo­m­en should not be considered “pro­perty” and must consent to marriage, but failed to mention female access to education or work outside the home. 
The Taliban have been under pressure from the international community, who have mostly frozen funds for Afghanistan, to commit to upholding women’s rights since the Islamist group took over the country on Aug 15. 
“A woman is not a property, but a noble and free human being; no one can give her to anyone in exchange for peace... or to end animosity,” the Taliban decree, released by spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, said. 
It set out the rules governing marr­iage and property for women, stating women should not be forced into ma­r­riage and widows should have sh­are in their late husbands’ property. Courts should take into account the rules when making decisions, and religious affairs and information ministries should promote these rights, the decree said. 

Two leading Afghan women praise the move

However, it made no mention of women being able to work or access facilities outside the home or educat­ion, which have been major concerns of the international community. 
During its previous rule from 1996 to 2001, the Taliban banned women from leaving the house without a male relative and full face and head covering and barred girls from receiving education. 
The Taliban say they have changed and high schools for girls in some provinces have been allowed to open. But many women and rights advocates remain sceptical. 
The international community, which has frozen billions in central bank funds and development spending, has made women’s rights a key element of any future engagement with Afghanistan. 
The country, which is also suffering from a banking liquidity crisis as the cash flow dries up due to sanctions, is facing the risk of economic collapse since the Taliban took over. 
Two leading Afghan women described issuance of the decree on Friday as a major step forward. 
“This is big, this is huge... if it is done as it is supposed to be; this is the first time they have come up with a decree like this,” said Mahbouba Seraj, the executive director of the Afghan Women’s Skills Development Centre, while speaking from Kabul to a Reuters Next conference. 
She said that even before the Taliban took over the country on Aug 15, Afghan politicians had struggled to form such a clear policy on women’s rights around marriage. 
“Now what we have to do as the women of this country is we should make sure this actually takes place and gets implemented,” said Seraj, whose shelter is a refuge for vulnerable women.
Roya Rahmani, the former ambassador for Afghanistan to the United States, echoed her optimism and added that it may partly be an attempt to smooth over international fears over the group’s track record on women’s rights as the Taliban regime seeks to get funding released. 
“(It’s) an amazing thing, if it does get implemented,” Rahmani told the panel, adding details such as who would ensure that girls’ consent was not influenced by family members would be key. 
“It’s a very smart move on the part of Taliban at this point because one of the (pieces of) news that is attracting the West’s attention is the fact that little girls are being sold as property to others in order to feed the rest of the family,” she said. 
Seraj said the Taliban now needed to go further, calling for the group’s spokesman to release more rules clarifying women’s rights to access public spaces.
“What I am really waiting to hear next from the same group, from the same person is for him to send the decree regarding the education and right of work for the women of Afghanistan, that would be absolutely phenomenal,” she said.

2,IHC forms panel to probe irregular appointments in sessions courts,Auditors had found that an inquiry into 103 irregular appointments had not been finalised despite lapse of several years.,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) constituted a committee headed by Justice Babar Sattar to probe five judges and an additional registrar in connection with 103 illegal appointments made in sessions courts of Islamabad. 
Of the five judges, two district and sessions judges have now retired while one is still working. Others to be investigated are an additional district and sessions judge and a senior civil judge. 
A departmental inquiry into the 103 irregular appointments in the sessions courts of Islamabad was finalised in May this year and a report submitted to the Chief Justice of Islamabad High Court for a final decision.  
According to the inquiry order available with Dawn, IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah appointed Justice Babar Sattar “to hold a regular inquiry against the following chairman and members of the Departmental Selection Committee of Session Division East, Islamabad, and Civil District East, Islamabad, into the matter of “illegalities/irregularities observed in appointment made in District Courts (East Division), Islamabad in the year 2012”. 
The inquiry order named two former district and sessions judges (DSJs), Syed Kausar Abbas Zaidi and Atiqur Rehman, and incumbent district and sessions judge Wajid Ali, who is currently working as Judge of Special Court for Control of Narcotics Substances (CNS). 
At the time of illegal appointments, former DSJ Syed Kausar Abbas Zaidi was the chairman of the Departmental Selection Committee (DSC) for appointments in sessions division (East) and former DSJ Atiqur Rehman and additional registrar Ali were the committee’s members. 
The DSC for Civil District-East comprised its chairman, Additional District and Sessions Judge Abdul Ghafoor Kakar, and two members, Senior Civil Judge Mohammad Amir Aziz and Additional Registrar Imtiaz Ahmed. 
The inquiry order, dated November 19, was issued by IHC Registrar Farhan Aziz Khawaja. 
During audit of the IHC from 2015 to 2020, auditors found that an inquiry into the 103 irregular appointments had not been finalised despite a lapse of several years. 
However, a meeting of the Departmental Accounts Committee (DAC) was informed that “a comprehensive inquiry has been completed and responsibility has been fixed. The inquiry report is lying with the Islamabad High Court for a final decision into the matter”. 
The inquiry is related to appointments against 103 posts of readers, civil nazirs, accountants, record keepers and other clerical positions in the sessions court.  
The posts were advertised in the national press and after initial scrutiny of the credentials of all candidates, 103 candidates appeared in a test in 2012. A number of petitioners challenged the appointment process for serious loopholes in the process. 
For example, a petitioner pointed out that 19 people whose names were not even mentioned in the list of successful candidates had been appointed. They were not among 30,000 candidates who had applied for these posts.

3,Laos opens $6bn Chinese-built railway line,The 414-kilometre route took five years to build under China’s Belt and Road Initiative.,"BANGKOK: A sleek red, blue and white bullet train departed a new Vientiane station on Friday, signalling the opening of Laos’ $6 billion Chinese-built railway. 
The 414-kilometre route took five years to construct under China’s trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative. 
Laos President Thongloun Sisoulith heralded a “new era of modern infrastructure development” for his country. 
“I am proud that the dreams of Lao people have come true,” he said at the opening ceremony on Friday afternoon. 
The railway will connect the Chinese city of Kunming to the Laotian capital Vientiane, with grand plans for high-speed rail to ultimately snake down through Thailand and Malaysia to Singapore. 

The 414-kilometre route took five years to build under China’s Belt and Road Initiative

Analysts have acknowledged a potential economic lift, but have asked how infrastructure-poor Laos will pay its $1.06 billion debt liability and whether it is ready to exploit the state-of-the-art transport system. 
The Laos government also took out a $480 million loan from the Export-Import Bank of China to cover two-thirds of its equity stake, bringing its total share of debt to $1.54bn. 
Scores of dignitaries in Vientiane waited on the red carpet waving flags at the launch ceremony before some, including Prime Minister Phankham Viphavanh, clambered aboard for a train trip to Vang Vieng — the adventure capital. 
At the same time a green train left Kunming station for the maiden journey to Laos. 
Chinese President Xi Jinping beamed in for the ceremony to extend his congratulations. 
“(We must) ensure the railway’s continued operation and maintenance as well as guarantee its safety, in order to build a high-quality, sustainable economic belt that benefits people’s livelihoods along the way,” he said. 
Laos, a communist-run country of 7.2 million people, previously had only four kilometres of railway tracks. 
The trains will speed along the new line at up to 160kmh, passing through 75 tunnels and across 167 bridges, stopping at 10 passenger stations. 
Passenger services are expected to begin on Saturday, state media reported, although only for those fully vaccinated against Covid. 
Four passenger services and 14 freight trips will operate daily, local media reported. 
A Buddhist ceremony was held on Thursday to bless the new railway, with Viphavanh banging a gong nine times to bring good luck, the Laotian Times reported. 
Laos took a battering in the pandemic with economic growth declining to 0.4 per cent in 2020, the lowest level in three decades, according to the World Bank. 
Hopes for a 2021 rebound were dashed when the country locked down as it registered more than 76,000 infections in the past eight months. 
The railway could boost Laos’ economy, but the government needed to undertake substantial reforms — including improving its border management systems, a World Bank report noted. 
But the project could be an economic “game changer”, according to Bangkok Bank chief economist Burin Adulwattana. 
“I don’t look at it as China trying to bankrupt Laos... it’s not a Trojan Horse strategy. I think it’s going to be a win-win situation,” he said. 
But there is little transparency around how Laos will fund its debt, Australian National University lecturer Greg Raymond said. 
A World Bank report noted “funding of the existing public infrastructure programme looks increasingly unsustainable”.

4,"Farooq Sattar, Shehbaz Sharif voice concern over worsening economic condition","PML-N, MQM to consult each other on EVMs, other issues.","LAHORE: A former convener of the MQM Coordination Committee, Dr Farooq Sattar, on Friday called on PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif and discussed matters concerning national and political importance. 
The two leaders discussed the overall situation in the country and important political issues. Both leaders expressed concern over the country’s worsening economic condition and increasing inflation. They agreed that circumstances demanded a change in the country.

PML-N, MQM to consult each other on EVMs, other issues

Talking to reporters after the meeting, PML-N secretary general Ahsan Iqbal said there was a need to send Imran Khan home if the country needed to save itself from an economic disaster.  
“There is a need to change the pilot and not the crew as it will not work,” he said. 
Meanwhile, Pak Sarzameen Party chairman Mustafa Kamal said on Friday that the Constitution should guarantee that elections to the national and provincial assemblies be made conditional upon the holding of local bodies polls so that the solution to public problems could be resolved at their doorsteps. 
“The three-point plan proposed by the PSP is the solution to 95 per cent of Pakistan’s problems,” he said. 
Mr Kamal called on Jamaat-i-Islami chief Sirajul Haq and Punjab Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Parvez Elahi during his visit to Lahore. On Thursday he met Shehbaz Sharif. 
Mr Kamal told them about PSP’s “principled stance” on the local bodies amendment act and the ongoing injustice against the people of Sindh.

5,"WHO says Omicron is in 38 countries, but no death reported",Global health body says it will take several weeks to determine how infectious Omicron is.,"GENEVA: Omicron has been detected in 38 countries but there are no reported deaths so far from the new Covid-19 variant, the World Health Organisation said on Friday. 
A WHO spokesman told reporters that the UN health agency had “not seen reports of Omicron-related deaths yet”. 
Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s technical lead on Covid-19, said Omicron had been reported in 38 countries, with the variant now spread across all six WHO regions. 
The WHO has said it will take several weeks to determine how infectious Omicron is, and to assess how vaccines, tests and treatments hold up against it. 
But it insisted on Friday that scientists were well on top of it and would be able to produce those answers soon. “We’re going to get the answers that everybody out there needs,” WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said. “We need to trust in the science now and be patient and not be fearful.” 
Van Kerkhove told viewers on social media there were some suggestions that the variant was showing increased transmissibility — but it would take a few more days to get a clear picture. 
“As for severity, the initial reports came from a cluster of university students and younger people tend to present milder disease,” she said. 
Of the mild Omicron cases found so far, Van Kerkhove said they were mainly travellers — and people who were sick would not be getting on planes in the first place. 
Therefore, it is “really too soon” to draw conclusions about Omicron’s severity, she said. 
On vaccines, the WHO stressed there was no reason to doubt the effectiveness of the current vaccines. “Right now there is no need to change the vaccines we’re currently using,” said Ryan. 
“There is no evidence to support that. But there’s a lot of work going on to look at if we were to change, how might we change those vaccines? 
“Get vaccinated. Right now that’s your best bet.”  Omicron was first reported to the WHO from South Africa on November 24, while the first known laboratory confirmed case was identified from a specimen collected on November 9. 
Van Kerkhove said a backlog of virus sequences had built up in November, meaning some of the earliest cases may yet be found outside South Africa. 
The Delta variant accounts for 99.8 per cent of sequences uploaded to the GISAID global science initiative with specimens collected in the last 60 days. 
“Delta has outcompeted all of the other variants circulating. With Omicron, we have to see what happens,” said Van Kerkhove.
