0,Swati apologises to ECP through lawyer,ISLAMABAD: Minister for Railways Senator Azam Swati on Friday apologised to the Election Commission of Pakistan ...,"ISLAMABAD: Minister for Railways Senator Azam Swati on Friday apologised to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) through his lawyer for his tirade against the commission and the chief election commissioner (CEC).  
Taking up a show-cause notice issued to Azam Swati, an ECP bench comprising Nisar Ahmed Durrani and Shah Mohammad Jatoi expressed displeasure over the absence of the minister from the hearing, asking if he was trying to avoid personal appearance before the commission.  
Mr Swati’s lawyer Barris­ter Ali Zafar informed the bench that the minister had to go to Quetta for some important work, “otherwise he would have come”.  
The lawyer then submitted an apology letter on be­half of the minister to the ECP and read it out. He said the minister had appeared before the commission twice and also submitted his apology.  
“I Azam Swati am a law-abiding person, a democratic man. I promote democracy and I have fought against corruption. I respect the Election Commission. My duty is to strengthen the ECP. I have always respected the ECP and did not try to scandalise it. If any such statement came from me, I apologise for it,” read the letter.  
After going through the apology letter, a member of the ECP bench said the railways minister should have been present during the hearing, adding that political statements should remain confined to political discussions.  
The ECP adjourned the case till December 22 after hearing arguments from Mr Swati’s counsel and directed the minister to appear in person at the next hearing.  
Talking to the media outside the ECP, Barrister Zafar said the minister would appear before the commission at the next hearing.  
Senator Swati had accused the ECP of taking money from companies that make electronic voting machines during a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Parliamentary Affairs on September 10.  
The ECP has reserved its ruling in a similar case against Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry. The minister had earlier apologised to the ECP for his slanderous remarks against the commission and CEC.  
The ECP had served notices to both the ministers on September 16, seeking explanations within a week from them to clarify their position over the allegations they had levelled against CEC Sikander Sultan Raja and the commission.

1,NAB arrests Sindh PA speaker on Supreme Court’s premises,Apex court tells Siraj Durrani his bail plea will be heard only if he surrenders to the bureau,"ISLAMABAD: The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) on Friday arrested Sindh Assembly Speaker Agha Siraj Durrani from the premises of the Supreme Court, which had told the PPP leader that his appeal would be heard only if he surrendered to the bureau to answer allegations of corruption.  
Consequently, Mr Durrani, who is accused of accumulating assets beyond his known sources of income, waited for almost four hours outside the Courtroom No. 2, where his appeal was heard by a Supreme Court bench, to receive the one-page order of the court.  
His appeal was taken up by a three-judge bench comprising Justice Umar Ata Bandial, Justice Sajjad Ali Shah and Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah. Mr Durrani was represented by his counsel Amir Raza Naqvi.  
The moment he stepped outside the Supreme Court building, the NAB authorities arrested him and took him away from the court’s parking area.  

Apex court tells Siraj Durrani his bail plea will be heard only if he surrenders to the bureau

“At the very outset, learned counsel of the petitioner undertakes for the petitioner (Agha Siraj Durrani) to surrender before the NAB authorities in order to pursue his petition before us,” the Supreme Court order said with a directive to its office to fix the hearing of his appeal next week.   
Talking to reporters outside the courtroom, the Pakistan Peoples Party leader said he would not leave the court premises until he received the court order.    
He said that his party had always taught political workers like him to respect the judiciary. “We are not afraid of arrests,” he said to a question by a media person.  
Earlier during the hearing, the Supreme Court observed that one should abide by law.   
Mr Durrani had come to the Supreme Court to file an appeal against Oct 13, Sindh High Court’s rejection of his post-arrest bail plea.  
The corruption inquiry against Mr Durrani was initiated by NAB on the complaint of Maulana Syed Aziz Ahmed Shah on Sept 13, 2018 on the allegations of accumulating assets and pecuniary resources to the tune of Rs1.6 billion at his native place in Garhi Yasin, Sindh, through illegal means and in active connivance with his family members, frontmen and servants.  
Earlier also Mr Durrani was arrested from Islamabad on Feb 20, 2019, five days before he was supposed to appear at the NAB office in Karachi.  
In his appeal, the speaker has pleaded that his family owned thousands of acres of land in Sindh even before the creation of Pakistan and he inherited and received a gift of 3,611 acres of agricultural land in Shikarpur district.   
He said that he was earlier arrested on vague and unsubstantiated grounds.  
His petition also accuses NAB of terrorising his daughters during a raid on his residence in Karachi on Feb 20, 2019.   
After his earlier arrest, he was taken to Karachi on transit remand from Accountability Court, Islamabad. Besides his physical remand was granted to NAB by the Accountability Court, Karachi, from time to time until April 12, 2019.  
On Dec 13, 2019, the SHC granted him post-arrest bail. However, the SHC order was challenged by NAB in the apex court, which through a short order on March 17, 2021 set aside the SHC order and referred the matter back to the high court for a fresh decision, but allowed Mr Durrani to remain on bail in the meanwhile. A different bench of the SHC dismissed his bail plea on Oct 13, 2021.  
Through his appeal before the Supreme Court, Mr Durrani has requested the court to set aside the high court order and grant him post- arrest bail in the reference pending before the Accountability Court, Karachi.

2,India to use Afghan trucks for sending aid to Afghanistan through Pakistan,Foreign Office says transportation from Wagah to Torkham allowed.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Friday permitted use of Afghan trucks for transporting Indian humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. 
“It has been decided to allow the use of Afghan trucks for transportation from Wagah border to Torkham,” FO spokesman Asim Iftikhar said. 
The decision was conveyed to the Charge d’Affaires of India at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he said. 
The move came as European Union’s envoy to Afghanistan Tomas Niklasson urged both Islamabad and Delhi to resolve issues concerning the transfer of Indian humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. 

FO says transportation from Wagah to Torkham allowed

Afghanistan, the UNDP fears, could face the worst humanitarian crisis of its history with nearly 23 million people facing imminent severe hunger and millions likely to sink into poverty. 
Pakistan had last week allowed Indian assistance for the war-torn country to transit through its territory on what was described as “an exceptional basis for humanitarian purposes”. 
India had offered to provide 50,000 metric tonnes of wheat and lifesaving medicines in humanitarian aid for the people of Afghanistan. 
Problems, however, arose at the time of negotiating modalities for shipment of the aid between Pakistan and India. India wanted its own trucks to carry aid goods up to the Afghan border, but the move was not acceptable to Pakistan. 
A proposal regarding handing over the assistance to UN agencies was also considered. 
It appears that finally as a compromise Pakistan has allowed India to use Afghan trucks for transportation of goods through the Wagah border. 
Mr Iftikhar said Pakistan’s decision “demonstrates the commitment and seriousness of the Government of Pakistan to facilitate the proposed humanitarian assistance”. 
Delhi was urged to “expeditiously” take necessary steps for delivery of humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan.

3,Ghastly murder of Lankan man in Sialkot shames nation,"Two main suspects among those arrested, raids continue; PM promises culprits will be punished with ‘full severity’ of law.","• Mob lynches victim over blasphemy charge, burns body
• Two main suspects among those arrested, raids continue to nab more 
• PM promises culprits will be punished with ‘full severity’ of law 
• Colombo ‘expects’ required action will be taken to ensure justice 
NAROWAL: Furious workers of a garment factory in Sialkot on Friday tortured their Sri Lankan general manager to death over allegations of blasphemy and set the body on fire. 
The brutal killing drew widespread condemnation from government officials and human rights bodies. 
The employees of Rajco Industries, located on Wazirabad Road, staged a protest on the premises alleging that Priyantha Kumara, had committed blasphemy. On receiving information about the protest, three personnel of the Uggoki police reached the spot, but the mob clearly outnumbered them, making them silent spectators. 
According to a local journalist, the district police chief was contacted several times on his mobile phone, but he did not answer. 
The protesters suspended traffic on Wazirabad Road and were joined by all the factory workers and a large number of locals. On seeing the mob gradually swell from a few dozen to hundreds, Mr Kumara dashed to the roof. Shouting slogans, the charged protesters chased him, dragged him out on the road and tortured him with kicks, stones and iron rods, killing him on the spot. The mob then set the body on fire. 

 

 
Sialkot Deputy Commissioner (DC) Tahir Farooq and District Police Officer (DPO) Omar Saeed Malik along with a heavy contingent of police reached the spot and took the body into custody. 
Rescue 1122 District Emergency Officer Naveed Iqbal said they transferred the body to Sialkot’s Allama Iqbal Teaching Hospital immediately, adding that a rescue ambulance and fire brigade were present on the spot during the protest.  
Mr Kumara, a Sri Lankan Christian, had been working at Rajco Industries for 10 years.  
Witnesses Mohammad Iftikhar and Mohammad Ilyas said when the protest started and the road was blocked, only three personnel from the Uggoki police station arrived. Had the DPO responded to the sensitive matter on time, the killing could have been avoided. They held police’s incompetence responsible for the gruesome incident. 
Mohammad Hafeez and Jabbar Khan recalled that in 2010 two brothers were lynched by angry protesters owing to police’s incompetence and failure to respond on time. 
Chief Minister Usman Buzdar took notice of the killing and demanded a report from the chief secretary and Punjab inspector general of police (IGP). “I am extremely shocked at the horrific Sialkot incident. I have instructed IG Police to thoroughly investigate it. No one is allowed to take law in their hands. Rest assured, individuals involved in this inhumane act will not be spared!!” he tweeted. 

 



 
Police managed to disperse the protesters from Wazirabad Road and reopen it for traffic. Later, Gujranwala Commissioner Zulfiqar Ghumman and Regional Police Officer Imran Ahmar also reached the spot as part of the inquiry into the incident. 
Sialkot police constituted 10 raiding teams to arrest the culprits. According to police sources, a first information report of the incident was registered at the Uggoki police station for aggravated murder and burning of the body against dozens of unidentified people under terrorism and murder provisions. Police collected videos of the torture from social media. They also claimed to have arrested over 145 suspects and transferred them to an unidentified location. 
Reacting to the “horrific vigilante attack”, Prime Minister Imran Khan said it was a day of shame for Pakistan. “I am overseeing the investigations & let there be no mistake all those responsible will be punished with full severity of the law. Arrests are in progress,” he tweeted. 

 



 
Meanwhile, a Sri Lankan media outlet reported that the country’s Foreign Ministry expected the Pakistani authorities to take the required action to investigate and ensure justice following the lynching of Mr Kumara. 
“The [Sri Lankan] Foreign Ministry has received reports of an alleged incident of torture and burning of the body of a Sri Lankan in Sialkot, Pakistan,” said spokesperson Sugeeshwara Gunaratna. “The Sri Lanka High Commission in Islamabad is in the process of verifying the details of the incident from the Pakistan authorities.”

Later in the day, Special Assistant to the Punjab Chief Minister on Information Hasaan Khawar said every aspect of the tragic incident was being investigated. 
Speaking at a presser, Mr Khawar, flanked by the IGP and Special Representative to the Prime Minister on Religious Harmony Allama Tahir Ashrafi, said a high-level inquiry was being conducted and its report would be made public in 48 hours. Immediate action would be taken against all those involved in this heinous incident. He claimed that around 50 people had been arrested while the process of identifying more culprits was under way with the help of CCTV footage and Nadra. 
In the evening, Punjab Law Minister Basharat Raja chaired a meeting at the Civil Secretariat to discuss the incident with the chief secretary, IGP, additional chief secretary (home), and the additional inspectors general of Special Branch and Counter-Terrorism Department. 
The Sialkot DC and DPO briefed the meeting about the details of the incident through video link. They claimed the deceased was known to be a strict administrator, adding around 110 suspects had been arrested, while raids were being conducted to apprehend the others. The police was seeking the assistance of other managers of the factory to identify the culprits. 
The meeting instructed the police to look into the administrative matters besides blasphemy allegations as the lynched manager was said to be a strict administrator. 
The law minister directed that security be beefed up in churches in and around Sialkot besides offering police protection to the foreigners working in different factories. Chief Secretary Kamran Ali Afzal said an impartial inquiry was being conducted and facts would soon be brought to the fore soon. 
In a late-night statement, the IGP claimed that two main suspects, Farhan Idrees and Usman Rasheed, were among those arrested. 
The army chief condemned the “cold-blooded and shameful murder” of Mr Kumara by a mob. “Such extra-judicial vigilantism cannot be condoned at any cost. The COAS directs all out-support to the civil administration to arrest perpetrators of this heinous crime and bring them to justice,” the Inter-Services Public Relations quoted the army chief as saying. 
Condemnations also poured in from across the political divide. Federal Human Rights Minister Shireen Mazari tweeted: “Horrific & condemnable act of the mob attack on factory & murder of Sri Lankan manager in Sialkot. Mob violence cannot be acceptable under any circumstance as state has laws to deal with all offences. Punjab govt’s action must & will be firm and unambiguous.” 

 



 
Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid said federal government institutions were assisting the Punjab government in investigating the incident. The National Crisis Cell was ascertaining the reasons behind the cruel act and the perpetrators will be taken to a court of law. 
“The entire society will have to work together to get rid of extremism in the name of religion,” he tweeted. 

 



 
In her tweet, PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz questioned if “such barbarity was our identity and the future of the coming generations”. Asking if the country could ever be considered safe, she said the government was non-existent and there was no one to question. 

 



 
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, in a statement, demanded an immediate and transparent inquiry into the incident, saying not only must the perpetrators be brought to justice, but the state also cease its collusion with far-right elements. “The unthinkable savagery with which a Sialkot mob has tortured a Sri Lankan man to death and burned his body on flimsy allegations of blasphemy should bring home once and for all the grim reality of spiraling radicalisation in Pakistan. Regrettably, the state’s response has been cowardly at best and complicit at worst,” it added. 
Global rights body, Amnesty International, expressed alarm over the lynching and demanded the authorities immediately conduct an independent, impartial and prompt investigation and hold the perpetrators accountable. “Today’s event underscores the urgency with which an environment that enables abuse and puts lives at risk must be rectified.” 

 



 
Moreover, the ulema and mashaykh of all religious schools of thought, Pakistan Ulema Council and Interfaith Harmony Council also condemned the killing, saying it was a violation of the teachings of the holy Quran and Sunnah. 
The Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), which was linked to the gory incident by social media users, distanced itself from the lynching, and condemned it. “While the incident is tragic, what’s equally sad is linking the TLP to it. We call for an independent and transparent investigation and those responsible to be arrested and exposed. When the rule of law prevails, no one will dare take the law into their hands,” a TLP spokesman said. 
A similar incident in Sialkot in 2010 had shaken the country when a mob had lynched two young brothers in the presence of police, declaring them dacoits. In 2019, the Supreme Court had commuted the death sentence awarded to seven people involved in the incident to 10-year imprisonment.

4,Fault lines in policies among factors behind instability: Shaukat Tarin,Non-essential imports to be banned for about seven months.,"• Concedes uncertainties in market due to inflation, currency depreciation, interest rate hike 
• Reassures people, markets that difficulties will subside in a few months 
• Non-essential imports to be banned for about seven months 
• PM’s aide says exchange rate should not be over Rs166-167 per dollar
ISLAMABAD: Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance and Revenue Shaukat Tarin on Friday conceded that the recent economic uncertainties were caused by external factors, fault lines in certain monetary and government policies and their exploitation by market players. 
He, however, sought public patience for a couple of months and regulatory action against banks to cool down inflation, stabilise exchange rate and end uncertainty in the market. 
Speaking at a joint news conference with PM’s Adv­iser on Commerce Abdul Razak Dawood, Mr Tarin tried to reassure people and markets that the economy was on a growth path and the difficulties of the lower-middle urban class would subside in a few months. 
“There is no need to worry, look at the fundamentals. The only permanent is that the economy is growing. The increase in taxes is not only because of imports, it’s all across, there is 32pc growth in income tax,” he said, adding that the national economy was getting stronger by the day as agriculture, services, industry and construction were growing.  
He said cash margins had been applied to import non-essential items and now the government would impose regulatory duties as well. 
The adviser said the imp­ort of non-essential imports, like completely built units (CBU) of vehicles, would be banned for six to seven months and the supplementary budget for withdrawal of Rs350bn worth of tax exe­mptions would take about 10 days to reach the parliament in the shape of a bill as the presidential ordinance was not acceptable to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 
He conceded that there were uncertainties in the market because of double digit inflation, currency depreciation, interest rate hike and higher import bill, which was not the situation at the time of the budget five months ago. 
He said the withdrawal of tax exemptions would not necessarily add tax burden on these sectors as the IMF wanted the tax distortions to be removed while the higher revenue collection could be diverted to such sectors through targeted subsidies.  
He said all these commitments had been made last year and he was able to reduce this fiscal burden by 50pc. 
The adviser believed that the real effective exchange rate (REER) should be no more than Rs166-167 per dollar and about Rs10 higher value was because of speculators and the role played by some banks.  
“They should not do this,” he said, adding that he had shared data on such activities with the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor who earlier did not believe the banks were involved in such profit taking.  
“Hopefully, you would see some action soon. I would not like to talk more on the issue,” he said. 
Mr Tarin counted inflation rate of 11.53pc and import bill of $7.75bn in November – almost 114pc higher than $3.6bn in October – as the reason for the anxiety.  
On the other hand, he said the increase in discount rate to 8.75pc by the SBP and related direction that monetary policy frequency had been reduced from eight to six weeks and may be further reduced to a month also created some disquiet. 
Based on this direction along with inflation at 11.5pc, the market anticipated further increase in discount rate and expected T-Bill’s rate to go up further and hence the market players increased their pricing because these issues ultimately raise the cost of doing business.  
The pick-up of treasury bills by the government at 10.75pc reinforced this sentiment and the market reacted accordingly. 
The PM’s aide on finance said inflation and import bill were interconnected and had external reasons of international commodity prices, otherwise domestic produce and perishable items had inflationary rate of about 3-4pc.  
International fuel prices including that of petroleum products, LNG, coal, steel and edible oils had a major impact both on inflation and import bill. 
Giving the breakdown, he explained that import bill was only $1.4bn higher than previous months. This included $252 million incremental impact of raw material import which was a good sign as it showed that the economy was on the wheels.  
The biggest additional burden of $508 million was on account of petroleum group mainly because of higher prices. 
He conceded that there were fault lines in the government policy as local refineries operated at low capacity and refined products were being imported.  
“This should not have been happening. This is a fault line and we are working on it,” he said, adding that higher furnace oil imports were also because of gas shortage and higher LNG prices. 
The adviser on finance said the third major import factor was $400 million worth of Covid-19 vaccines, which was funded by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. Abdul Razak Dawood, on the other hand, put the cost of vaccines at $350 million.  
Mr Tarin said the $134 million impact was because of food and edible oil, adding that fuel prices were witnessing a pushback in the international market and hopefully LNG price would also fall. However, he ruled out any reduction in the price of edible oil in the near future. 
The adviser said India and Bangladesh also faced sudden jumps in import bills but their impact on inflation was relatively lower because they did not have to make energy price adjustments which had been on hold for long.  
Mr Tarin said prices of all domestic edible items were lower than last year and had he followed the same taxation strategy, petroleum should have cost Rs175 per litre instead of Rs143-145 at present. 
Abdul Razak Dawood said the country’s exports were showing a record increase and growing month after month while increase in imports was due to the raw material, which showed the economy was growing.
