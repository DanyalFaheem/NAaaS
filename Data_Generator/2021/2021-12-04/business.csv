0,SC seeks centre’s help in provincial finance body award case,Petition argues local govt is the most deprived tier of the state in terms of funds.,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Friday sought the federal government’s assistance on a petition pertaining to the Provincial Finance Commission (PFC) Award announcement by chief ministers for distribution of financial resources at grassroots level. 
In his petition, former parliamentarian Raja Munawar Ahmed urged a three-judge SC bench, headed by Justice Umar Ata Bandial, to declare the unbridled and unchecked discretionary powers with regard to the allocation of financial resources of the state, ‘encroached’ by the chief ministers of the four provinces, illegal, unconstitutional and against fundamental rights. 
Representing the petitioner, senior counsel Chaudhry Faisal Hussain pleaded for the interpretation of relevant rules to restrict the use of discretionary powers by the respective chief ministers with regard to allocations of development funds and distributions on a political basis.  

Petition argues local govt is the most deprived tier of the state in terms of funds

The apex court sought assistance of the federal government in the matter while the case would be taken up at a later stage. 
According to the petition, the President under Article 156 of the Constitution was mandated to constitute a National Economic Council (NEC) comprising chief executive of the federation, all provinces any other members as nominated by the chief executive. 
The petition contended that NEC was an important constitutional body mandated to review overall economic condition of the country, formulate plans in respect of the financial, commercial, social and economic policies and also ensure balanced development and regional equity etc. It contended that the meeting of the NEC was required to be held at least twice a year and was also responsible to submit annual report to the National Assembly and Senate. 
It pleaded that the purpose of NEC was to have uniformity in development of urban and rural areas in a coherent and equal manner. But in violation of constitutional mandate, the financial application of the resources were applied disproportionately and even the cities generating substantial funds were being deprived of their due shares in the financial outlay by the provinces. 
According to the petition, the local government despite being the third tier of the state in terms of its definition under Article 7 of the Constitution were the most deprived when it comes to the distribution of funds.  
The petitioner conceded that he had not made the local government as parties in his petition but would add them through his amended petition. 
In an earlier order, Justice Mushir had observed that the questions raised through the petition for the implementation of the constitutional mandate was an obligation of each organ of the state in terms of Article 5 of the Constitution, which commands loyalty to the state and obedience to the Constitution. 
Since the financial rights and interest of the citizen were involved, it warranted the consideration by the Supreme Court in terms of Article 184(3) of the Constitution, Justice Mushir had noted. 
The petition had sought a direction that the discretionary allocations of development funds at the behest of the chief executives of all the four provinces should be halted forthwith. The court was requested to order the federal government that future NFC award should be ‘balanced, comprehensive’ and should be devised under Article 156(2) through the PFC Award in accordance with the law and Constitution.  
The petition had sought a court direction for the respondents to exercise and perform the financial powers and functions strictly in accordance with Article156 (2), read with all enabling provisions of the Constitution and the law.

1,Gas-buying clause abolished for three LNG power plants,SNGPL okays proposal for setting up LNG terminal at Karachi port.,"LAHORE: Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited’s board of directors on Friday allowed a waiver of the minimum 66 per cent take-or-pay clause for three government-owned liquefied natural gas (LNG) power plants in Punjab in a bid to reduce the burden of capacity payments and increase the interest of both local and foreign investors in the government’s plan of privatising these projects. 
The board also approved a proposal in principle for setting up another LNG terminal by a private firm at Karachi port. 
Federal Minister for Energy Hammad Azhar appreciated the decision on Friday, claiming that it would help the government in reducing the capacity payments. In the long run, the SNGPL’s decision “will help in reducing capacity payments that the government has to pay power plants even when they are not supplying electricity”, he tweeted. 

 



 

SNGPL okays proposal for setting up LNG terminal at Karachi port

In 2017-18, state-owned National Power Parks Management Company commissioned two combined cycle H9 technology power plants at Haveli Bahadur Shah in Jhang and Balloki in Kasur.  
The projects, having a capacity of over 1,200 megawatts each, utilise regasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) to produce electricity.  
Before that, Punjab government-owned Quaid-e-Azam Thermal Power (Private) Limited also completed the 1,180MW gas-fired power plant in 2016-17 to implement the previous government’s agenda of taking the country out of an energy crisis under its short-, medium- and long-term strategies. 
The completion of these plants added almost 3,600MW to the national grid. 
Under the agreements, the SNGPL was liable to supply 600 million cubic feet per day of uninterrupted gas to these plants. On the other hand, the plants were liable to take a minimum of 66pc of their total gas demand or pay the cost (capacity charges) to the SNGPL at times when they are not in operation due to maintenance or when the country’s electricity demand is low.  
Meanwhile, various long-term hydropower projects were also completed, including Neelum-Jhelum and Tarbela 4th extension projects, which almost ended the gap between power demand and supply in summer and resulted in surplus energy in winter.  
After coming into power, the current government decided to implement its privatisation policy that also involved selling the Haveli Bahadur Shah and Balloki power plants. However, it couldn’t be done due to lukewarm interest from bidders who were reluctant to make bids due to the take-or-pay clause. 
Now that the clause has been abolished, “the plants will be supplied gas as per their demand, which would help the government privatise its plants soon”, SNGPL’s Managing Director Ali J Hamdani told Dawn.  
“It was the cabinet’s decision to abolish the take-or-pay condition to provide an enabling environment to bidders and reduce capacity charges. The SNGPL board agreed with this decision,” he said.

4,TPL Properties to raise Rs18.3bn for three Karachi projects,KARACHI: TPL Properties Ltd is raising a fund of Rs18.35 billion from local institutional investors that its...,"KARACHI: TPL Properties Ltd is raising a fund of Rs18.35 billion from local institutional investors that its subsidiary will use to acquire and develop three commercial and residential properties in Karachi, according to a recent regulatory filing.
The fund is being generated via a real estate investment trust (REIT), which operates like any other company but offers more transparency to investors. All assets under a REIT are controlled by a trustee instead of its majority shareholder. The entity must list on a stock exchange within three years of its financial close, thus letting small investors take exposure to an otherwise capital-intensive real estate market. Afterwards, REIT units are traded on the stock exchange just like ordinary company shares.
“I can’t disclose the exact number of investors at this point in time. But we’re targeting an investor base of 10-15 financial institutions. There’s no retail participation at this time,” TPL REIT Management Company Ltd CEO Ali Asgher told Dawn.
He’s expecting it to achieve financial close by the end of 2021. Next up will be the acquisition of the targeted properties for development. The first asset is a two-acre piece of land in Korangi that the REIT will develop into a technology park.
The second property is located at the intersection of the upscale Hoshang Road and Abdullah Haroon Road on which the REIT will construct a high-end, 30-floor residential tower along with a small commercial portion.
The third property is a 40-acre piece of land in Korangi Creek that the REIT will acquire and develop into an upmarket gated residential community.
TPL Properties Ltd has already acquired the three assets. It’ll contribute the same to the REIT fund and acquire units (or shares) in it as a strategic investor.
Mr Asgher didn’t share the exact shareholding that TPL Properties Ltd is aiming to have in the REIT. As its strategic investor, however, his company’s shareholding can’t be less than 25 per cent, he said.
Moreover, TPL Properties won’t be able to sell its stake in the REIT, although other investors can decide to divest their shareholdings when the entity goes public. Alternatively, the fund size may grow at the time of listing and dilute the shareholding of existing shareholders.
“Going forward, we may add yielding assets, meaning developed properties that’ll generate rental income for REIT unit-holders,” he said.
“I don’t want to promise any rate of return for retail investors. But for the institutional investors we’re getting on board right now, my model shows a 30pc internal rate of return,” he said.
The dividend yield of the country’s first — and only listed — REIT for the trailing 12 months is 11.9pc. Dolmen City REIT was launched six years ago and holds prime rental assets on Karachi’s seashore.
The latest REIT is the fourth such entity to be launched in Pakistan. It’s the third REIT in 2021 as Arif Habib Dolmen REIT Management Company announced two schemes in July.
“The growth angle was missing from the earlier set of regulations. One fund could only have one project. A second project would require a second fund. It didn’t make economic sense to manage, say, five funds for five projects,” said Mr Asgher, adding that multiple properties can be developed under a single fund now.
