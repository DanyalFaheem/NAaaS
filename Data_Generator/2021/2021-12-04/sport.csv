One of the most bizarre goals seen for years. Two goals from Cristiano Ronaldo, taking him past 800 in his amazing career. And, most importantly, a wild 3-2 win over Arsenal that ushered in another new era at United.
Rangnick wasnt officially in charge of United for the match on Thursday, that honour went to Michael Carrick, who ended his three-game spell as interim coach unbeaten, but he was there to watch his new team display the same shortcomings and flashes of brilliance that characterised United under the previous manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.
And Rangnick, like every else in the stadium, would have been bewildered at the nature of the opening goal, scored by Arsenal midfielder Emile Smith Rowe while United goalkeeper David De Gea was lying on the ground on the goal-line, clutching his foot.
De Gea had been trodden on by team-mate Fred at a corner but play carried on as the ball found its way to Smith Rowe, who volleyed into an empty net from the edge of the area. Referee Martin Atkinson put his whistle toward his lips but chose not to blow it and, after a long wait while De Gea received treatment, signalled a goal to the chagrin of United players who immediately surrounded the official.
One of them was United captain Harry Maguire, who later said it was unsportsmanlike for Arsenal to have played on.
United responded through Bruno Fernandes’ goal on his 100th appearance for the team before Ronaldo scored either side of a strike by Martin Odegaard to guide United to a victory that lifted the team to seventh place, three points off the top four.
Ronaldo, whose winner came from the penalty spot and was followed by his trademark pirouette-in-the-air celebration, moved onto 801 goals for his career for club and country and played like a man eager to impress his new manager.
“What can you say about him?” Fernandes said of the 36-year-old Ronaldo. “He is proving game by game, season by season, year by year, he wants to keep being the best.”
Rangnick, who was hired Monday as interim manager for the rest of the season, received his work permit hours before the match and will take charge for the first time against Crystal Palace at home on Sunday.
Carrick won’t be around for that. Minutes after the final whistle, United announced the former midfielder who played for the team from 2006-18 before joining the coaching staff would be leaving the club. Carrick said he wanted to spend more time with his family, having gone straight into coaching after retiring as a player.
“It was like an old-school classic,” Carrick said of the win, “and hopefully the boys will go on to enjoy more nights like this in the future.”
Arsenal stayed fifth, missing a chance to jump into the top four.
EASY FOR TOTTENHAM
A routine win. A clean sheet. That’s much more like it for Antonio Conte at Tottenham Hotspur.
A 2-0 victory over Brentford was the perfect response by Spurs to their last game, a loss to Slovenian minnows Mura that prompted Conte to publicly declare his concerns about the quality in the squad he has taken over.
Son Heung-min was the architect behind the win, playing the part in the opening goal in the 13th minute his cross ended up ricocheting into the net off Brentford midfielder Sergi Canos and then finishing off the second at the end of a sweeping counterattack in the 65th.
The win moved Tottenham into sixth place and meant the team is unbeaten in three league games under Conte.
“I’m happy because I have seen great commitment and good passion [from] the players,” Conte said. “It’s a good reaction. In a loss you learn a lot. ... The players are starting to understand my philosophy.”

1,Arslan snatches point for Udinese in eight-goal Lazio thriller,MILAN: Tolgay Arslan scored eight minutes into stoppage time to snatch a 4-4 draw for Udinese at the end of an...,"MILAN: Tolgay Arslan scored eight minutes into stoppage time to snatch a 4-4 draw for Udinese at the end of an incredible match at Lazio which featured comebacks and three red cards.
Lazio thought they had won a memorable encounter at the Stadio Olimpico after rebounding from 3-1 down at half-time to lead 4-3 with 11 minutes remaining.
However Arslan curled home a superb first-time strike from Fernando Forestieri’s free-kick to save the unlikeliest of points for Luca Gotti’s team.
“It was a great match, they’re a good team with a great coach and a point for us is very important,” Arslan, whose goal celebration sparked a touchline brawl in which Walace was sent off, said to Sky. “Sure I celebrated but this is football, it’s about emotions.”
Maurizio Sarri’s side were already under pressure after being humiliated at Napoli at the weekend and things looked even bleaker at full-time after conceding four times twice is as many league matches. They sit ninth in Serie A, nine points from the Champions League places.
Lazio got off to the worst possible start in front of a sparsely populated and wet Stadio Olimpico.
Beto nodded the away side in front with a superb header with 16 minutes on the clock and the home crowd started to barrack their side with whistles just after the half hour mark, when the Portuguese forward brilliantly rounded Pepe Reina and rolled home his sixth Serie A goal of the season.
Ciro Immobile halved the deficit for the home side shortly afterwards with a simple tap-in but Lazio looked in serious trouble a minute before the break when Nahuel Molina expertly finished after a lightning counter-attack.
Sarri’s charges came out firing after the restart and were level before the hour through two fine finishes.
First Pedro collected the ball on the edge of the area in the 51st minute and drilled a low shot into the bottom corner. And five minutes later Sergej Milinkovic-Savic scored the goal of the night, calmly looking up before whipping in a curling left-footed shot that clipped in off the post.
A minute later Patric picked up a second yellow card for a foul on Isaac Success, leaving the hosts down to 10.
Fortunately for Lazio, Molina was sent off for a second booking of his own in the 69th minute and parity of numbers allowed the home side to push for the win.
Francesco Acerbi had to wait an age for what he thought was his winning goal, which had initially been ruled out for offside, to be given following a VAR check.
But with the home fans whistling again, only this time for the end of the game, Arslan stepped up to silence the crowd and start a shoving match on the sidelines.
In Thursday’s other match, Empoli also came back to two goals down to draw 2-2 at Torino.

Medvedev defeated Mikael Ymer 6-4, 6-4 on Thursday to give Russia an insurmountable 2-0 lead over Sweden in the quarter-finals of the revamped team event. 
Andrey Rublev earlier outlasted Elias Ymer, Mikael’s older brother, in a 6-2, 5-7, 7-6 (7-3) win at the Madrid Arena. With Russia having secured the win after the two singles matches, the doubles match wasn’t played. 
Russia will face Germany in the semi-finals on Saturday for a place in Sunday’s final with Novak Djokovic’s Serbia meeting neighbours Croatia in the other semi-final. 
“Today I should have served better but really happy to bring the point to the team,” said 25-year-old Medvedev, who served seven aces to Ymer’s one. 
“Madrid feels like home, we’re winning a lot of matches. We beat Spain the other day so I think it was a great boost of confidence to beat the home favourites. It’s always nice to beat someone at home in their country.” 
Russia beat Serbia in the quarterfinals of the events first edition in 2019 before losing to Canada in the last four. Russia are seeking their third Davis Cup title after triumphs in 2002 and 2006.

After a 1-1 draw following extra time, Rayo won the shootout 4-3 after the hosts missed a pair of penalties. Rayo goalkeeper Luca Zidane, son of former France great Zinedine Zidane, stopped the final penalty.
Playing without veteran striker Radamel Falcao, Rayo took the lead with a goal by Jose Angel Pozo in the fifth minute and Guijuelo equalised through Daniel Garcia in the 19th.
Rayo played a man down from the 79th because of a red card to defender Kevin Rodrigues.
Another five La Liga teams won against lower-tiered clubs. Levante, last in the league standings, routed Huracan Melilla 8-0 with a hat-trick by Alex Blesa. Osasuna defeated San Agustin 4-0, Valencia got past Utrillas 3-0, Elche won 2-0 at Leioa and Cadiz trounced Villa de Fortuna 7-0 with three goals by Alvaro Negredo.
This season’s edition of the Copa includes teams from all six divisions of Spanish football.
Atletico Madrid, Real Madrid, Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao, who will play in the Spanish Super Cup in January, are not playing in the opening round.

The first ODI in Pretoria last Friday was abandoned due to rain before the rest of the series was cancelled as travel bans were imposed on southern African countries.
The Dutch side took a week to secure passage home and they will now be forced into quarantine. The Netherlands Cricket Union said the squad had taken several Covid-19 tests in South Africa and would undergo more on Friday. No member of the team has tested positive.
Those players who live in Britain will stay in quarantine in the Netherlands for 10 days before travelling on, while home-based players could undertake their quarantine at home.

6,Entire coaching staff leaves Yorkshire after racism scandal,"The departures follow allegations made by former player Azeem Rafiq, who is of Pakistani descent.","LONDON: All members of Yorkshire’s coaching team have left, including director of cricket Martyn Moxon and coach Andrew Gale, the club said on Friday as it vowed to regain trust and rebuild after being rocked by allegations of institutional racism.
First team coach and former captain Gale was suspended last month as part of a probe into an alleged anti-Semitic tweet he sent in 2010 while Moxon had been absent from work due to a  “stress-related illness”.
The departures follow allegations made by former player Azeem Rafiq, who is of Pakistani descent and is a former captain of the England Under-19s.
Rafiq said he had received racist abuse and was made to feel like an outsider at Yorkshire and that he had even contemplated suicide.
The scandal has shaken English sport, cost Yorkshire sponsors and the right to host England internationals, and embroiled some of the biggest names in English cricket.
Yorkshire, whose chief executive Mark Arthur resigned last month, said in a statement a new director of cricket will be appointed imminently and a new coaching team was being recruited.
The backroom medical team, provided by an outside clinic, had also left.
“Significant change is required at Yorkshire County Cricket Club and we are committed to taking whatever action is necessary to regain trust,” said new chairman Kamlesh Patel.
“The decisions announced today were difficult to make, but are in the best interests of the club. Without making important changes to how we are run, we cannot move on from the past to become a culture which is progressive and inclusive.”
Patel said the club had a  “huge rebuilding job to do” and was determined to learn from the mistakes made.
“We want to make Yorkshire County Cricket Club a place for everyone, from all backgrounds. To do this, we need to rebuild our culture and instil positive values in everyone associated with Yorkshire,” he added.

13,"With Shakib returning, BD ready to face Pakistan","DHAKA: Emboldened by the return of all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan, Bangladesh are ready to finally challenge ...","DHAKA: Emboldened by the return of all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan, Bangladesh are ready to finally challenge Pakistan. 
The teams will start their second and final Test on Saturday. Pakistan won the first by eight wickets and also swept Bangladesh 3-0 in a Twenty20 series before that.
Shakib missed all of those matches with a hamstring injury sustained during the Twenty20 World Cup. He was included into the first Test squad but then failed a late fitness test. 
“For me, as a captain, everything gets easier when Shakib is around,” Bangladesh skipper Mominul Haque said. “Everything is fine with him at this moment. You know he is a player with two in one. He is such a player who can give us the combination we are comfortable with. We now can return to our traditional combination of four bowlers and seven batsmen.”
Mominul, however, is waiting for a fitness report on fast bowler Taskin Ahmed, who injured his right hand during the third T20 against Pakistan. 
Bangladesh’s pace bowling struggled in the first Test, claiming only two wickets. Pakistan’s fast bowlers had 16 wickets. 
“We have to assess his condition tomorrow before the toss,” Mominul said of Taskin. “But since New Zealand series is coming up, I don’t think we’ll take any risk with him.” 
Bangladesh have had some success in recent years in Dhaka’s Mirpur stadium, where they have won five of their last seven Tests, including victories against both England and Australia. 
Spinners played a key role in their success but Mominul said they were unlikely to follow the same strategy against Pakistan. 
“Everyone from the sub-continent plays spin very well,” he said. “So it is better not to give them a spin wicket. I think everyone else would do the same. I prefer a flat wicket.” 
Bangladesh’s top order faltered in both innings of the first test, being reduced to 49-4 and 39-4, which also played a key role in the loss. 
“The first hour of the test cricket is always important but unfortunately our top order collapsed in the first hour in both innings of the first Test,” Mominul said. “I think everyone is now aware of how important the first hour is. Our main strength is our batting. We have to bat at least six sessions to put pressure on Pakistan bowlers. We are here to win the game, so we hope well come back strongly.” 
SHAHEEN LAUDS PACE PARTNER HASAN 
Pakistan have won 11 out of 12 matches between the two sides, with one draw. 
“We will play the same aggressive brand of cricket that we showed in the first Test,” Pakistan pacer Shaheen Shah Afridi said, adding he enjoyed bowling with Hasan Ali as the latter helped him put opponents under pressure. 
Shaheen and Hasan have emerged as Pakistan’s new pace bowling pair in 2021, taking 83 wickets in Tests between them. 
“I enjoy bowling with him. This year he has 39 wickets, I have 44. We bowl in partnership and plan between ourselves,” Shaheen told reporters. 
If a batsman plays well, he added, the pair plan “how we can hold or confuse him. This is why I enjoy bowling with him. He is a fighter”. 
Hasan and Shaheen shone in Pakistan’s eight-wicket win over Bangladesh in the opening Test in Chittagong, each claiming five-fors. 
Hasan finished with 5-51 in the first innings as Pakistan bowled out Bangladesh for 330 runs, while Shaheen’s 5-32 in the second innings kept the target within the visitors’ reach. 
“The wickets in Asia are more or less slow. People say spinners get more assistance here. But if you are physically strong and have the strength it is possible to be effective here. You need to bowl in a partnership,” Shaheen added. 
The hosts will be desperate to make a comeback in the second leg of the series, but Shaheen promised them no let-up. 
“Momentum is good and the team combination is also brilliant,” he said. “The boys are ready for the second Test. Of course, we will fight and end the series on a good note.”

14,IPC Minister claims FIFA willing to work with  govt to resolve PFF crisis,FIFA-appointed Normalisation Committee does not comment on Dr. Fehmida Mirza's statement.,"KARACHI: The Federal Minister for Inter-provincial Coordination claims that global football body FIFA has shown willingness to work with the government to resolve the issues surrounding the Pakistan Football Federation. 
The FIFA-appointed Normalisation Committee, though, had “no comment” on that claim. And the crisis surrounding the country’s football governing body shows no signs of abating. 
Pakistan was suspended by FIFA in April after the court-elected PFF led by Ashfaq Hussain Shah seized control of the PFF headquarters from the Haroon Malik-led NC. 
Since then, the NC has won support from the government and things seemed to be heading their way when the PFF headquarters were sealed by the Lahore Deputy Commissioner over the non-payment of its lease for the last three years. 
Ashfaq, who came to power after an election held by the Supreme Court in December 2018 which was not recognised by FIFA, immediately cried foul-play, claiming that the IPC Minister Dr. Fehmida Mirza was behind the move to seal the headquarters. 
At a news conference in Islamabad to announce the launch of the Kamyab Jawan Sports Drive on Friday, Dr. Fehmida was hopeful that the PFF impasse will end soon. 
“For the first time, FIFA has said that we will work with the government and the IPC minister to devise a mechanism for a transparent PFF election,” she said. 
Her claim was startling since FIFA statutes are clearly against third-party interference in the affairs of its member associations — elections foremost. 
To hold fresh elections of the PFF — which has been in turmoil since 2015 — FIFA appointed the NC in September 2019. 
But the NC had in October welcomed government oversight over funding as well as the establishment of a regulatory framework when Dawn revealed that those were the conditions for the government to support the NC in its battle to free the headquarters from Ashfaq. 
The government seems to have fulfilled its part of the bargain. “The NC has given it to me in writing,” Dr Fehmida told Dawn on Friday, when asked if she was totally sure that FIFA was aware that the government will be involved in the election. 
However, she added the NC wouldn’t get control of the PFF headquarters until it arranges a meeting of the government with FIFA officials. 
“We want to talk to FIFA to be assured of how things will move forward from here,” Dr Fehmida added. “The headquarters will not be handed over to the NC until it arranges for talks with FIFA.” 
Only recently, in a case similar to Pakistan, FIFA has held talks with one government.  While announcing the Normalisation Committee for Chad earlier this week, it announced that one its mandate would be “to develop a coope­ration agreement bet­ween the Ministry of Sports and the Chadian Football Federation, with FIFA’s guidance, including defined objectives and responsibilities for each party.” 
PFF NC chairman Haroon, though, remained tight-lipped whether something on similar lines would happen in Pakistan. “No comment,” he told Dawn in a terse reply on Friday, when asked if the NC had given the government something in writing regarding its role in the elections. “All that we’ve given the government is the election roadmap … and that too according to the PFF statutes.”

15,Ton-up Agarwal leads India’s fightback after Patel’s four wickets,MUMBAI: Mayank Agarwal hit a gritty hundred to rescue India from a precarious position after New Zealand left-arm...,"MUMBAI: Mayank Agarwal hit a gritty hundred to rescue India from a precarious position after New Zealand left-arm spinner Ajaz Patel had put them in a spot of bother with three quick wickets on the weather-hit first day of the second and final Test on Friday. 
Opener Agarwal remained unbeaten on 120 after completing his fourth Test hundred to help India reach 221 for four wickets at stumps with wicketkeeper-batter Wriddhiman Saha keeping him company on 25 not out at the Wankhede Stadium.
Mumbai-born Patel, whose parents immigrated to New Zealand in 1996, picked up all four wickets on a track aiding the spinners to finish with figures of four for 73. 
After the first session was wiped out due to a wet outfield, Agarwal and Shubman Gill gave their side a solid start with an opening stand of 80 following captain Virat Kohli’s decision to bat having won the toss. 
Patel gave New Zealand the breakthrough by dismissing Gill for 44 when the batter edged a delivery to the lone slip. 
The 33-year-old Patel returned in his next over to dismiss Cheteshwar Pujara and Kohli before they had opened their accounts, much to the disappointment of the few hundreds present at the ground which overlooks the Arabian Sea. 
Kohli, who returned to the side to lead India after being rested for the three-match Twenty20 series and the first test in Kanpur, reviewed the leg before wicket decision unsuccessfully and trudged off after a chat with the on-field umpires. 
Television replays were inconclusive in showing if he had hit the ball before Patel’s delivery struck his pad. 
From 80 for no loss, India were reduced to 80-3 and it was left to Agarwal and Shreyas Iyer, who made a dream Test debut in Kanpur with a first-innings 105 followed by a crucial 65 in the second, to launch the fightback for the hosts. 
The duo added 80 for the fourth wicket to rebuild the innings before Iyer fell on 18 to become Patel’s fourth scalp. 
“Obviously this is kind of what dreams are made of,” Patel told reporters. “So to be out here [in Mumbai] and to go out there and pick up four wickets in the first day, it’s pretty special. 
“At the same time the job is only half done, so we’ve got to make sure we turn up tomorrow and then really work hard for the last six wickets.”
The dismissal brought Agarwal and Saha together and the pair defied New Zealand’s bowlers for the rest of the day with an unbroken partnership of 61. 
A square-driven four off seamer Daryl Mitchell took Agarwal to three figures and the 30-year-old leapt and punched the air to celebrate his first test hundred since he scored a career-best 243 against Bangladesh in 2019. 
The right-handed batter hit 14 fours and four sixes in his knock. 
“It’s an amazing feeling to get a century in test cricket and to get it in Wankhede is extra special,” said Agarwal. “It’s going to be very important, how we start [tomorrow] is crucial, the focus is that. The first session we want to play it out, the wicket is going to get harder and harder to bat on.” 
Agarwal told reporters there was a conscious decision to attack Patel, who he said had “bowled exceedingly well” during the day, keeping up the pressure on the home team. 
“He had that phase when he tied us down,” Agarwal said. “If we would have let him bowl the way he did, he would have ended up with more wickets.” 
Both sides were dealt injury blows before the test with the tourists losing captain Kane Williamson to an elbow problem while the hosts lost Ajinkya Rahane, who led the side in Kanpur in Kohli’s absence, Ravindra Jadeja and Ishant Sharma. 
The opening Test ended in a thrilling draw, with New Zealand’s last batting pair han­ging on in the final session to deny the hosts a victory.

Now, he’s in the lead heading into the final 18 holes at the country’s most lucrative golf tournament.
Minhaj, who returned to the Pakistan Golf Federation Tour after a three-year gap last week, fired a stunning six-under 66 at the Chairman JCSC Golf Championship to go top of the leaderboard at the end of the third round here on Friday.
The performance at the Karachi Golf Course took Minhaj to a total of eight-under 208 and a two-shot lead over Pakistan’s top golfer Shabbir Iqbal (67), who will be looking to make it two titles in two weeks after his victory at the Governor’s Cup.
Talib Hussain (69) is a shot further adrift while Mohammad Zubair (68) and Abdul Zahoor (69) sit on 212.
Matloob Ahmed, who was the joint-leader with Mohammad Khalid at the end of the second round, slipped to five shots off the lead after he could only return a card of 72.
Mohammad Munir and Mohammad Ashfaq both fired 70 and are a shot behind Matloob at 214.
Three other golfers are at 215, with Khalid (75) and Ahmed Baig (73) at 216.

17,"Mendis, Embuldeniya spin Sri Lanka to series sweep over WI",West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite was disappointed with the result but sought to single out positives for his side.,"GALLE: Sri Lanka spinners Ramesh Mendis and Lasith Embuldeniya picked up five wickets apiece against the West Indies to lead the hosts to a 164-run victory on the final day of the second test in Galle on Friday. 
Off-spinner Mendis completed his second five-wicket haul to finish with 11 wickets in the match as Sri Lanka completed a 2-0 series win against the Caribbean side to pick up the full 24 points on offer in the World Test Championship.
Sri Lanka, who were all out for 204 in the first innings, declared their second innings closed at 345 for nine early on the fifth day, setting the tourists a target of 297 to try and win the match and level the series. 
While the target seemed out of reach on a track assisting the spinners, a draw did not seem unlikely when West Indies reached 65 for one. 
But Mendis (5-66) and Embuldeniya (5-35) then ran through the batting lineup to bundle them out for 132 in the second session as West Indies lost their last eight wickets for 40 runs. 
Mendis, 26, took his tally to 18 wickets in the two Tests to pick up the player of the series award. 
“One thing Ramesh does is he spins the ball really big,” said outgoing Sri Lanka head coach Mickey Arthur after he signed off with a win. 
“We’ve just had to work on him being really consistent with his lines and with his lengths — the attacking lines that he’s worked on. I just think he’s getting his just rewards now.” 
Embuldeniya finished with seven wickets across the two innings as the Sri Lankan spinners took all 20 West Indies wickets to fall in the match. 
West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite was disappointed with the result but sought to single out positives for his side. 
“When you are playing in these conditions, it is always a learning curve,” he said. “I am sure we will get better.” 
Sri Lanka were still batting when play started on the final day and they declared their second innings in the morning session. 
Dhananjaya de Silva, adjudged the player of the match, was unbeaten on 155 and his overnight partner Embuldeniya was out for 39 bowled by Jason Holder.
De Silva faced 262 balls and hit two sixes and 11 boundaries in scoring his eighth test century. 
West Indies lost their first second-innings wicket with the total on 15 when captain Brathwaite (6) was trapped lbw by Mendis. 
Then Nkrumah Bonner joined Jermaine Blackwood and the pair added 50 runs for the second wicket before Blackwood (36) was caught by de Silva off Embuldeniya in the last ball before lunch break. 
When Mendis had Shai Hope (16) caught by Lakmal, West Indies’ score stood at 92-3, but it triggered the late collapse. 
Bonner top scored for the West Indies with 44.
