1,Muqam accuses ECP of partiality over election code violations,HARIPUR: Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz provincial president Amir Muqam has asked the election commission to take...,"HARIPUR: Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz provincial president Amir Muqam has asked the election commission to take action against the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister and his cabinet members for announcing development projects in the districts where the local body elections are scheduled to be held on Dec 19.
He made the demand while speaking to party workers and candidates for the local government polls at the residence of former provincial minister Qazi Asad Khan here on Friday. 
Mr Muqam said the election commission had issued notice to PML-N parliamentarian Murtaza Javed Abbasi, but avoided sending the one to Chief Minister Mahmood Khan despite the fact that he had announced development schemes for Battagram and other areas in violation of the election code of conduct.
“If the ECP really wants to ensure the holding of fair and transparent elections it should take action against the chief minister and his ministers as well as they are running the campaign for their party men,” he said.
Mr Muqam, however, declared that the PTI leaders won’t get votes as their government had destroyed the economy. “The stock market crash has deprived the shareholders of billions of rupees, while rupees has touched rock bottom in respective of value against the US dollar,” he maintained, declaring that voting for bat was tantamount to putting the country into further mess.
He claimed that Prime Minister Imran Khan had lost the credibility to be called as the chief executive of the country as he had bowed down before the IMF conditions.
He exhorted the party workers to wage jihad against the sitting government. He claimed that the days of PTI government were numbered and that the PML-N would not only form the government in the centre but also in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.
Mr Muqam urged the people of Haripur to vote for the PML-N candidates. “The people should vote for the Nawaz Sharif’s party for he had given them mega energy and road projects,” he said. He said the PML-N had allotted local body tickets on merit.
Former provincial minister Qazi Mohammad Asad, former speaker provincial assembly Habibullah Tareen, former MPA Raja Faisal Zaman, former MNA Sardar Mushtaq and PML-N district president Sahibzada Hamid Shah were among those who spoke on the occasion.

2,Pashto book on literature and culture of Swat launched,PESHAWAR: Literati and research scholars gathered here on Friday to express their views about a new Pashto title...,"PESHAWAR: Literati and research scholars gathered here on Friday to express their views about a new Pashto title ‘Da Swat Pakhto Adab auo Saqafat’ (Pashto literature and culture of Swat), authored by Prof Mohammad Ali Dinakhel. 
The book launching ceremony was held here under the auspices of Pohantoon Adabi Stori at the Khyber Union Hall of Islamia College Peshawar. 
The speakers while discussing various sections of the book termed it a must read for research scholars and general readers since it gave a deep insight into hidden treasure of Swat valley in different periods. 
“The rulers of the princely State patronised artists, musicians and literati to promote peace, mutual respect and goodwill in the valley,” they said. 
They said that poets, writers and artists had immensely contributed to the Pashto language and art. 
They said the author had researched history, art, culture and literature that flourished when Swat valley, then the ‘State’, was controlled by rulers followed by its merger into Pakistan in 1969, especially when the princely state adopted ‘Pashto’ as its official language. 
Chairing the event, Prof Abaseen Yousafzai said the new book spread over 803 pages had left out no area unattended having even a remote importance to the public life of Swat valley. 
He said the author had retrieved valuable information regarding art, history, literary trends and cultural and social traditions governing public life in the region. 
Prof Dinakhel, author of the book, said his objective was to provide authentic information to the research scholars, adding that Swat enjoyed rich literary and cultural background since the advent of Alexander (327 BC) to the valley. He stated his book had over seven chapters, each featuring distinct period. 
Prof Izharullah Izhar said that Prof Dinakhel had preserved a precious treasure that would benefit not only casual readers, but also those interested in knowing about the Swat valley, once the centre of Gandhara civilisation. 
“The book is a fascinating account of the past glory of Swat valley. Literati and artists hailing from Swat continue contributing to the KP and the country at large,” he commented. Prof Anwar Ali, Tariq Danish and Najeebullah Shadab also spoke on the occasion.

4,Regional blood centres in KP to be outsourced amid employees’ concerns,Health officials claim RBCs will be fully operational by March.,"PESHAWAR: The health department has planned to contract out its regional blood centres in Peshawar, Dera Ismail Khan and Abbottabad to private firms to ensure that they become fully functional by early March.
Bids have been invited by the government-owned Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Health Foundation for the initiative to be carried out under the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Public Private Partnership Act, 2020.
Officials of the department told Dawn that the three regional blood centres were established during the Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal government but remained ‘dormant’ until they began partial operations five years ago.
They said the centres were meant to provide blood to the critically-ill patients admitted to hospitals of the same region free of charge and on need basis besides scaling up public awareness of blood donation.

Health officials claim RBCs will be fully operational by March

The officials insisted that the performance of blood centres wasn’t up to the mark and therefore, the health department had decided outsource their operations.
They said the contract-winning organisations would be given the control of RBCs by the district health officers, who currently managed the centres.
The officials said the project included the operations and maintenance of RBCs, which would generate blood and its products, and would have serve as the storage and distribution centres for hospitals in their respective areas.
They said the accord would be signed under the principles of the Good Manufacturing and Good Laboratories Practices.
The officials said the Health Foundation was mandated to outsource public health facilities to firms having experience in operating the health system with a view to improve their performance and cater to the healthcare needs of catchment population.
They said the relevant district health officers would provide policy guidelines to the selected organisations and would ensure the timely provision of funds.
The officials said the RBCs failed to deliver the goods and motivate the people for blood donation on which the lives of the seriously-ill and injured patients depended.
They said the RBCs outsourcing decision had been taken after a long review, which showed that the centres required to be operated on fast-track basis to address blood shortages for lifesaving procedures in hospitals.
The officials said the centres would be strengthened to screen donors for hepatitis, malaria, HIV and other diseases to ensure that patients get safe blood.
They added that the safe blood transfusion in district and tehsil headquarters was one of the main objectives of the move by the Health Foundation, which had already contracted out health facilities in the merged tribal districts.
The officials said the foundation would set performance indicators for private organisations to operate blood centres and would be responsible for contract management, review and monitoring.
They said the government would continue to provide proper budget to those centres as usual, but they would be managed by NGOs or other organisations to be selected for them after the completion of bidding exercise.
The officials said the partner organisations would impart training to staff members in blood collection and management and evaluation of the project to ensure high bio-safety measures for them and provide blood and its products of the best quality to patients.
They said they interested organisations had been asked to furnish plans and timelines for their execution to make the RBCs fully operational.
The officials said a third party would carry out the audit of the related affairs.
Meanwhile, employees of the regional blood centres have voiced concern about the move and declared it a bid to privatise the centres and thus, rendering them jobless.
They told Dawn on condition of anonymity that instead of selling out those centres, the government should strengthen them by providing them with better funding.

Led by Amir Ahmad, Shamsher Ali Advocate, Mohammad Ali, Habibul Haq Burhan, Faridoon and Taj Malook, a large number of local people gathered at Saidu Chowk to record their protest against the illegal occupation and encroachment of the land of the main cemetery of the area by land mafia.
After the protest, they held a meeting which was addressed by the area elders.
The elders said the 296 kanals Saidu Sharif graveyard was the biggest in the region where dead were buried from different parts of lower Swat. 
However, they said for the past few years an influential land mafia was busy occupying the graveyard land under the nose of the district administration.
They claimed the district revenue department had even transferred the land to the influential people and said they would now take practical steps to recover the land.
The elders said they had formed a proper body for the graveyard known as Saidu Sharif Central Council (SCC). They said the mafia people were so influential that they were selling the occupied land to others where residential buildings were being constructed.
They claimed that about 12 houses had been built illegally on the graveyard land. They said the SCC had now started removing the illegally constructed buildings and two of them had already been destroyed.
The elders also passed resolutions, demanding retrieval of the graveyard land from the mafia, demarcation of the cemetery and construction of boundary wall around it.

8,Peshawar High Court seeks govt response to plea against Citizenship Act,Admits petition on citizenship denial to woman’s Afghan husband.,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has admitted to full hearing a petition against the Citizenship Act’s provision, which allows the country’s citizenship for the foreign wives of Pakistani men and not the foreign husbands of Pakistani women.
A bench consisting of Justice Lal Jan Khattak and Justice Mussarat Hilali issued notices to the attorney general for Pakistan and interior minister to file response to the petition of Pakistani woman Sameena Roohi, who sought orders for the government to grant Pakistani citizenship to her Afghan husband, Naseer Mohammad.
She claimed that the law discriminated against Pakistani women.
The petitioner requested the court to declare unconstitutional and discriminatory Section 10(2) of the Pakistan Citizenship Act, 1951, under which the wife of a Pakistani national is entitled to the country’s citizenship, but the same is denied to the foreign husband of a Pakistani woman.

Admits petition on citizenship denial to woman’s Afghan husband

She sought orders to declare that Section 10(2) of the Citizenship Act was not brought in conformity with the fundamental rights within two years of the commencement of the Constitution, which was a mandatory requirement under Article 8(4) of the Constitution.
The petitioner’s counsel, Saifullah Muhib Kakakhel, contended that Section 10(2) of the law was discriminatory and didn’t treat men and women equally.
He said his client belonged to a respectable family, was married to an Afghan national, Naseer Mohammad, in 1985, and had five children from the marriage, who all were Pakistani nationals.
The lawyer said the petitioner’s husband had been working in Kuwait for a long time and he had only been granted Pakistani visa for a short period of one month or so to visit his family.
He said that the woman’s husband had not been given an appointment in Kuwait for visa due to Covid-19 pandemic, so he could not visit his family.
Mr Kakakhel contended that the petitioner had visited the Nadra and immigration offices to seek citizenship for her husband, but was told that Section 10(2) of the law applied only to the foreign wife of a Pakistani citizen.
He contended that the Federal Shariat Court had declared in 2008 the impugned provision repugnant to the injunctions of the Holy Quran and Sunnah, and called it discriminatory, against gender equality, and a violation of articles 2(a) and 25 of the Constitution.
The counsel argued that Pakistan was home to millions of refugees from Afghanistan, who shared the same culture and language, and a large number of them had contracted marriages with Pakistanis especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, but only the spouses of men are granted nationality of Pakistan and Pakistani women were deprived of the same.
He referred to several international conventions to which Pakistan is a signatory, including Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and said by not amending the Citizenship Act, the government had been violating all those international laws, which declared that there should be no discrimination on basis of gender.
The respondents in the petition are Nadra through its director-general, interior ministry through its secretary, and directorate-general of immigration and passport through it director-general.

He said attempts were being made to divert the attention of the nation from the real issues by playing up the issue of electronic voting machines. He said the PTI government’s insistence on EVMs was tantamount to pre-poll rigging. 
Criticising the three-year performance of the PTI government, Mr Baluch said the mafias within the ranks of the government were the root cause of all the problems.

“The Tanoli tribesmen in three districts of Hazara division will punish their elected members by subjecting them a historic defeat in the next elections if they don’t keep their election promise about Tanwal district notification,” Tehreek District Tanawal chief Dr Abdul Rauf Tanoli told reporters here on Friday.
Dr Tanoli said all princely states were given the status of districts at the time of their merger with Pakistan but unfortunately, the largest state of Amb in Hazara division was divided into Mansehra, Abbottabad and Haripur districts under a conspiracy.
He said hundreds of families from the tribe were forced to relocate from native villages, while the construction of Tarbela dam shattered the family bonds and cultural heritage of Tanolis.
Dr Tanoli said the tribesmen living in three districts had long been demanding the separate Tanawal district, but to no avail.
He said all governments had made false promises to Tanolis and therefore, the latter had decided to fight for their rights under the banner of the Tehreek District Tanawal.
“We urge all elected MNAs and MPAs from Tanawal belt of Hazara division to fulfil their promise on Tanawal district notification otherwise we won’t vote for them in the next elections,” he said.
Dr Tanoli said he wasn’t opposed to the upgradation of Alai tehsil as a district but it was unfair to ignore the longstanding demand of district status for Tanawal.
