The activists had gathered to protest outside the admin block of the university.
Three days ago, IJT activists had a brawl with the members of the Punjabi Council over pasting the posters of their programme.
The Punjabi Council was also organizing their cultural programmes and had hoisted posters in different hostels but the IJT activists started pasting their posters on those of the Punjabi Council. This led to a clash between the two groups and cases were registered against the attackers.
The IJT activists while demanding the arrest of the attackers, attacked the offices of the VC, registrar and public relations officer and vandalised the doors and windowpanes. A heavy police contingent came to the spot and dispersed the attackers and cleared the place.
A spokesperson for the IJT said that they demanded action against the outsiders living in hostels and also nominated in several cases.
He said these outsider residents should be arrested because they were creating the law and order situation on the campus.
Later, Iqbal Town SP Raza Tanveer had a meeting with VC Prof Dr Niaz Akhtar and other officials.
An insider on the condition of anonymity told Dawn that the SP refused to arrest the attackers as the arrests would create the law and order situation and urged the VC to hold dialogues with the IJT activists.
The VC, dismayed at the police approach, left the meeting in protest.
A spokesperson for the PU said that a complaint had been filed with the police to take legal action while the administration would expel those students involved in the incident of vandalism on Friday.
He said that the activists of the IJT had ransacked different offices after a fight that erupted among some students and some outsiders near the main cafeteria.
He said the university had taken measures to establish peace on campus and only a few dozen students on all sides were trying to disturb the peaceful environment of the university.
He said that the administration was identifying these students with the help of footage and strict action will be taken against them as per law.
On the other hand, Punjabi Council Chairman Khurrum Gondal said that four of their activists who were sitting at Main Cafeteria were beaten by the Hailey College IJT activists. 
He said the IJT activists had torn their posters installed on the campus.

Blind persons disrupt event on International Day of Persons with Disabilities

Pakistan’s blind cricket team captain Abdul Razzaq, who is currently in charge of a  school for the visually impaired, said any person with disability could  achieve his or her goal by working hard. He said he loved cricket and had won two world cups for the country.
“I did not stay home for being a visually impaired person, rather I challenged myself and worked hard to achieve my goal.” 
He believed that the persons with disabilities  could perform better than normal people in any field of life.
A  group of students with impaired hearing staged a drama about how Covid-19 spread in the country, highlighting the difficulties faced by the public and health workers during the pandemic. They also paid tributes to health workers for their services.
The students performed on national songs, while a 10-year-old girl, Bisma Attaullah, displayed her piano skills. She told Dawn that she lacked confidence, but was encouraged to play the piano by her teachers.
The minister said a dedicated helpline had been established to provide round-the-clock help to the persons with disabilities. He said recently the department got vacated its 104-kanal land at Sharaqpur where a sports complex would be built for such persons.
He said around 303 institutes were established in the province where 36,000 persons with  disabilities were studying to become confident citizens of the country.
Later, the minister distributed shields among the participants in the ceremony.
Earlier, a group of blind persons disrupted the event in protest against non-provision of jobs and chanting slogans against the department for not giving them employment. 
The minister approached them, assuring them that their grievances would be addressed. 
Later, the protesters settled down in the hall and the administration resumed the programme.
As the programme concluded, the blind persons again approached the entry and exit gates of the hall and closed them to stop the authorities from coming out of the hall without fulfilling their demands. However, the administration managed to escape from the hall from the backdoor. 
The protesters approached the vehicle of the minister and blocked it. The minister approached the protesters again and asked them to allow him and his family to go and he would hold a meeting with them to fulfill their demands at his office on Saturday (today). He  said his wife and two children were waiting to go home and he also had to offer Friday prayers.
The protesters did not budge from their place and the minister had to call another vehicle to leave the place with his family.
The protesters dispersed after the minister left the site.

5,NA-133 by-poll an ‘opportunity’ for PPP’s revival in Punjab,LAHORE: The Pakistan People’s Party is vigorously taking part in the NA-133 by-poll being held in Lahore that is...,"LAHORE: The Pakistan People’s Party is vigorously taking part in the NA-133 by-poll being held in Lahore that is considered a citadel of rival Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, (PML-N), with a hope for the party’s revival in Punjab.
The enthusiasm the PPP is exhibiting in the electioneering for NA-133 has surprised many, even its die hard workers or jiyalas, as the party leaders not only from Punjab, but also from Sindh, including provincial cabinet members, are appearing in the corner meetings to show support for its candidate, Chaudhry Aslam Gill.
Though chairman Bilawal Bhutto is not here, his father and former president Asif Ali Zardari is camped in Lahore for many days to boost morale of the workers and woo the disgruntled local leaders.
A senior party leader, considered a confidant of Mr Zardari in Punjab, says the party is taking the electoral bout as a test case and part of the preparations for the next general election.
“We’re availing the opportunity of a ‘one-on-one’ contest, after the ruling PTI was knocked out of the race on technical grounds, to gauge our performance. We will analyse whether people turn to us or a new force emerges to fill the vacuum [created by the absence of PTI],” he says, requesting not to be named. “This analysis will help us in preparing our strategy for the next general election,” he says, adding that the PML-N is also taking the fight seriously.
These views are endorsed by Altaf Hussain Qureshi, a senior leader and member of the committee that had authored the party manifesto for 2002 polls. “The contest shall serve as a barometer to access party’s popularity as well as performance of Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, who as new Punjab chapter president is overseeing the by-polls.”
Mr Qureshi is impressed by the mobilisation of workers during the election campaign. “It was surprising to see so many charged jiyalas, both male and female, young and elderly, after a long time. All are enthusiastically engaged in the election campaign, unlike in the past when a candidate would be left to fen for himself during electioneering.”
He discloses that deviating from the past practice, the party sympathisers are contributing generously to the election expenses of Mr Gill, who belonging to a lower-middle class family can’t afford the expenditures.  
Some party leaders claim that the by-poll opportunity is being utilised to revive the PPP’s traditional resistance culture, shunning its reconciliation image created by president Zardari’s policies.
“The party has in principle decided to make the NA-133 by-polls a turning point in its bid to revive its resistance culture as reconciliation policy has caused much damaged,” Punjab chapter secretary general Syed Hassan Murtaza tells Dawn.
He says from now on any cooperation with the PML-N or any other party will be based on issues, unlike in the past when long-term collaboration had been arranged.
“We want to revive the PPP in Punjab and form the next government in the province. Not just in Lahore, whenever such an opportunity comes our way we will contest it forcefully.”
The PTI’s absence in the Lahore by-poll will definitely benefit the PPP as some of the supporters and voters who had abandoned it for its reconciliation policy have started returning to the party folds, he admits.
The PPP’s performance has been on the decline in Punjab, particularly Lahore, since the rise of Nawaz Sharif in 1985 polls that were boycotted by the party. It had bagged six out of nine National Assembly seats from Lahore in the 1988 election, and one each in the 1990 and 1993 contests. However, the party could not win even a single Lahore seat in 1997. In 2002 polls, when the Sharifs had been banished to Saudi Arabia by Gen Musharraf regime, the PPP secured three out of 13 seats. In 2008 it clinched two seats, while in 2013 and 2018 elections the party failed to bag even a single seat in the city.

7,Those made to leave PML-N are returning now: Nawaz Sharif,Directs PML-N Punjab president Rana Sanaullah to complete the party’s reorganisation in the province by Dec 20.,"LAHORE: Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif has said those who were ‘forced’ to leave the PML-N because of political engineering are now returning to the party folds.
He was speaking at an organisational meeting of the party held at its provincial headquarters here in Model Town via video link from London on Friday.
“Those joining the party were our party members as they were forced to change their loyalties through political engineering before the 2018 polls,” the PML-N Quaid told the participants in the meeting where Aleesha Iftikhar Baloch from Jhang (NA-114), Asif Mauvia from NA-116 and Akbar Ali Shah announced joining the party.
Nawaz said when “political engineering” failed they (a reference to the establishment) had to shut the RTS (result transmission system) to win the election. 
The PML-N often claims that prior to 2018 elections, dozens of its “electables” from Punjab were forced by the powers that be to join the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI). 
He directed PML-N Punjab president Rana Sanaullah to complete the party’s reorganisation in the province by Dec 20.  
“There should be another meeting on the party reorganisation (in Lahore) on Dec 27 in which a complete report in this regard should be presented,” he said and added once the process would be completed, the PML-N would be invincible (in Punjab).
The former premier, who has been living in the UK since November 2019 because of his ‘medical treatment’, said the PML-N wanted to bring the country back to the road to progress.  
“In the PTI regime, Pakistan’s economy is fast declining while in our [PML-N] tenure it was progressing. The people were hoping against hope that this inept government might deliver at some point of time but it miserably failed on all fronts,” he said and chided the Imran Khan government for bringing the country to “the brink of economic disaster”.  
The people were suffering immensely because of the skyrocketing prices of flour, pulses, sugar and medicines, he lamented.
Nawaz said the PML-N government had said goodbye to the IMF, while the PTI pledged the country’s assets. The incumbent government also weakened the rupee and failed to get the country off the grey list, he added.
Reiterating the party’s stance, Nawaz said: “We all have to follow the narrative of giving respect to the vote. “We need to stay strong and should not be afraid of speaking the truth.”
Awais Leghari, Azma Bokhari, Hanif Abbasi, Nadeem Kamran, Saud Majid, Abdur Rehman Kanju and Sheikh Aftab were also present.

8,"Kidnapped, runaway children cases a challenge for police","LAHORE: The provincial capital has witnessed a sharp surge in the number of kidnap/abduction of children. Police,...","LAHORE: The provincial capital has witnessed a sharp surge in the number of kidnap/abduction of children.  
Police, however, claim that most of these cases turn out to be of the runaway children or those missing due to family issues.  
The official crime record shows 40 children were allegedly “kidnapped” from Lahore during the last 10 days of November and police recovered 27 of them and efforts are under way to trace others.  
On Friday, police recovered two children who were kidnapped from Shadbagh and Sanda areas a few days ago. Two-year-old Abdul Rehman was allegedly kidnapped from Afshan Colony of Shadbagh and police resolved the case by arresting suspects Naila Bibi and Farooq Ijaz.  
The Shadbagh investigation police traced the suspects through mobile phone call records besides using intelligence network, a police official said. He said the police recovered the two-year-old baby from the suspects and handed him over to his parents.  
He said the woman was in some “doubtful relationship” with the suspected man and they were in search of a rented house in the area. The property owners had refused to rent out houses to them for not producing Nikahnama.  
Meanwhile, the police official said, the ‘couple’ found Abdul Rehman in a street and kidnapped him to present him as their son to the property owners. They later managed to get a house on rent. He said the woman’s parents had already lodged a kidnap case against unknown men. While investigating this case, police reached the rented house and traced the woman. During house search, he said, police also found Abdul Rehman and on questioning, the woman told the truth.  
In the other case, 11-year-old Naila was kidnapped from Sanda area on Thursday and police traced her through safe city cameras and recovered her from a shelter home. The police official said the girl used to go to a seminary where the teacher would beat her. The panicked girl on Thursday ran away from the seminary, he said, adding that locals later left her at a shelter home. 
The provincial capital has witnessed a sharp increase in incidents of kidnap and runaway children due to multiple reasons. As for the other 40 children, the record showed the FIRs were lodged on the complaints of their parents under section 363 of the PPC.  
The section 363 of the PPC reads, “Whoever kidnaps any person from Pakistan or from lawful guardianship, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.” 
Ten of them were girls, according to the official record available with Dawn. The data showed the police recovered 27 of these ‘kidnapped’ children. All the cases were registered under section 363 of the PPC (kidnap charges).  
However, the police officers are of the view that most of them are runaway children, declaring it a serious problem in the local family system.  
Lahore Investigation SSP Imran Kishwar told Dawn that under the new policy the incumbent regime of the city police had issued strict directions to all the divisional SPs and the SHOs for “free registration of cases”. He said this policy was being implemented in ‘letter and spirit’ for the first time which is evident from the official record of last 10 days of November.  
Since most of them were those who had run away from homes, schools, seminaries and workplaces due to multiple reasons, police registered kidnapped cases as their parents were insisting on the same. Police traced most of them using multiple resources including safe city cameras, human intelligence and sources and reunited them with their parents.  
The investigation linked most of these cases with the family issues/disputes or other reasons instead of serious charges of kidnap for ransom or any other criminal offence.  
Mr Kishwar said several children were recovered from the local shelter homes or from the residences of their relatives. Some of the children reached their homes by themselves.  
Referring to a case of Harbanspura, the police officer said Tayyabur Rehman filed a complaint against unknown persons claiming his four children Fajar, Tuba, Abdullah and Azmat had been kidnapped. Police registered a kidnap case under section 363 of the PPC and during investigation traced the four children from the house of her paternal grandmother, linking the matter with the family dispute.  
Similarly, a kidnap case of four children of a family -- Araiba, Ali Hamza, Ali Raza and Alia -- was lodged with the Baghbanpura police station on the complaint of their mother Mafia Bibi.  
It was learnt later that they were living with their father in Burewala district and the incident again was the result of the dispute between their parents.  
The SSP said police were discharging their core functions effectively but the social perspective and family feuds must be addressed to prevent incidents of kidnap or ‘abduction’ of children.

Social Welfare and Baitul Maal Department Secretary Hassan Iqbal also presented a copy of the draft bill to the court and stated it had been forwarded to the cabinet after holding consultative meetings with the stakeholders. However, he sought some more time to finalise the draft.
Justice Jawad Hassan observed that this was the first legislation made on the court’s direction for the empowerment of persons having disabilities, with the assistance of experts, including stakeholders, relevant departments and bodies.
The judge noted that the then chief justice, Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, now a Supreme Court judge, had made efforts to safeguard rights of the persons with disabilities (PWDs) and also passed landmark judgments being followed in Pakistan.
However, the judge regretted that the recommendations made by a commission in the report with regard to constructing buildings and public facilities accessible to the PWDs, had not so far been implemented.
The judge directed the secretary to submit the final Act after getting approval from the cabinet and the Punjab Assembly. The hearing was adjourned till Dec 17.
A physically challenged woman lawyer, Sana Khursheed, had filed a petition against the non-provision of basic facilities to such persons at the public places and buildings.
Justice Hassan observed that the issue pertained to the persons having disabilities, which after enactment of draft Act will be entitled to certain rights.
He appreciated the steps taken by the petitioner and the input given by her, along with other activists, who participated in the commission constituted by the court.
