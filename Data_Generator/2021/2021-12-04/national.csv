“With inflation breaking all previous records, how long do you expect @ImranKhanPTI that we government official will remain silent & keep working for you without been paid for past 3 months & our children been forced out of school due to non-payment of fees. Is this #NayaPakistan?,” the tweet read. 
The tweet was accompanied by Saad Alvi’s music video mocking Prime Minister Imran Khan statement Aap ney ghabrana nahin. 
“I am sorry @ImranKhanPTI, am not left with another option,” read another tweet. 

FO regrets frivolous activity through account of Serbia mission

As the messages from the official account soon got viral, the Foreign Office said the account had been hacked.  
The hacker soon afterwards also hacked embassy’s Facebook and Instagram accounts. 
The hacking took place at 9.59am on Friday, whereas the messages were posted an hour later from Karachi, the embassy said. The IP address, it said, was being shared with “relevant quarters” in Pakistan for investigating the matter. 
Denying the claim about non-payment of salaries, the FO statement explained it was a “baseless and un-factual” post. “This is totally false and far from reality,” it said. 
The accounts were retrieved in the afternoon and the posts were deleted. 
Later, Pakistan’s embassy in Serbia also said the account had been hacked and a ‘baseless’ tweet was posted on it from a device in Karachi, adds Dawn.com. 
“The Twitter account of the Embassy of Pakistan [in] Belgrade, Serbia (@PakinSerbia) was hacked and logged in from a Chrome desktop on a Windows device in Karachi, Pakistan at 0559 hours local time (09:59 PST),” a statement issued by the embassy said, adding that a message was posted from the hacked account at 6:59am local time (10:59 PST), which was not from the embassy. 
“After the hacking of the Twitter account, a baseless and unfactual post was [...] made regarding the non-payment of salaries. This was totally false and far from reality.” 
According to the embassy, all of its employees are paid their salaries regularly, “and there is no disruption in the education of the children of [its] officers and staff”. 
“The embassy is receiving funds from Islamabad on a regular basis,” the statement read. 
It added that the embassy “does not take any responsibility for the above-mentioned posts and deeply regrets the frivolous activity generated through the hacked account”.  
The statement further said the embassy’s Facebook and Instagram accounts were also hacked apparently using the same device from which its Twitter account was hacked. “The Twitter account was retrieved at 0911 hours local time (13:11 PST),” it said, adding that the IP address of the device used for hacking it was being shared with relevant quarters in Pakistan for further investigation into the matter. 
Earlier this week, data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics showed inflation edged up to 11.5pc from 9.2pc, the highest increase noted in the past 20 months influenced by a record hike in fuel prices in October. 
The massive rupee depreciation fuelled import-led inflation. Inflation measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased to its highest level in 20 months.

1,Pakistan hopes wider acceptance will open UN doors for Afghanistan,"To gain global acceptance, Taliban need support of some powerful nations, but so far most of the 193 UN members are reluctant.","UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan hopes that greater acceptance for the Taliban government will lead to their representation in the United Nations. 
On Wednesday, the UN Credentials Committee deferred its decision on allowing the Taliban to represent Afghanistan in the world body. The committee also stopped Myanmar’s military junta from representing the country in the UN. 
“Under the circumstances, the decision to defer consideration of the credentials was expected,” said Pakistan’s UN Ambassador Munir Akram. “Once there is a wider consensus on official acceptance of the new Afghan government, its credentials will be accepted.” 
Sweden’s UN Ambassador Anna Karin Enestrom, who heads the credentials committee, confirmed on Thursday that Kabul’s new rulers will not have representation in the UN yet. “The committee has decided to defer its decision of the credentials in these two situations (Afghanistan and Myanmar),” she said. 

To gain global acceptance, Taliban need support of some powerful nations, but so far most of the 193 UN members are reluctant to do so

The Taliban seized Kabul on Aug 15 and in September they asked the UN to let their representative speak at the 76th session of the General Assembly, which began on Sept 14, 2021. 
The Credential Committee, however, could not meet before the end of the session and, therefore, the Taliban’s request was not considered. 
This left Ghulam Isaczai of the ousted regime as the official representative to the UN, despite Taliban protestations that he “no longer represents Afghanistan”. 
The current members of the Credentials Committee include the Bahamas, Bhutan, Chile, China, Namibia, Russia, Sierra Leone, Sweden and the United States. Normally, the committee takes its decisions by consensus. 
The deferral indicates that both Afgh­anistan and Myanmar would remain out of the UN system through much of 2022. 
Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen, however, said it was an ‘unfair decision’ and urged the UN to reconsider it. 
“The Credentials Committee decided yesterday that for now, the seat of Afghanistan at the UN be not given to the new government in Afghanistan,” he said in a tweet posted on Thursday. 
“This decision is not based on legal rules and justice because they have deprived the people of Afghanistan of their legitimate right,” he added. 
“We hope that this right is handed over to the representative of the government of Afghanistan in the near future so that we can be in a position to resolve issues of the people of Afghanistan effectively and efficiently and maintain positive interaction with the world.” 
To gain UN acceptance, the Taliban need the support of some powerful nations, like the United States, but so far most of the 193 UN members are reluctant to do so.
Human rights groups also oppose granting recognition to the Taliban regime. 
Some Taliban leaders are still on UN sanctions lists.

2,Students transform Lahore varsity campus into Hogwarts,A film made and acted by students is also being screened at the festival,"LAHORE: It took more than a wave of a wand, but students of a university in Lahore transformed their 150-year-old campus into Hogwarts this week as they kicked off a festival celebrating the fictional young wizard Harry Potter. 
With its vast halls and soaring archways, Government College University in Lahore has long reminded students of the magical school created by British author J.K. Rowling, several students said. 
“I can’t believe I’m in Hogwarts, while being in Lahore of all places,” said an excited Raziah Alam, taking part in the festival. 
“This has been such a fun experience.”

A film made and acted by students is also being screened at the festival

Dressed in costumes from the “Potterverse”, including wands and pointed witch and wizard hats, students welcomed visitors to their version of the Hogwarts “Great Hall”, decorated with broomsticks, bats, and even an area to brew potions.
The theme music from the Harry Potter films played in the background as students tried out spells, took photos wearing the famous “Sorting Hat”, and dressed up in Hogwarts uniforms. 
“Most of these youngsters grew up at the time when JK Rowling’s work was being presented in the novels and then later on in the films,” said Dr Asghar Zaidi, the university’s vice chancellor and a “Potterhead” himself. 
He said that when students come to the campus “they see the architecture, it reminds them of Hogwarts”. “I think the magic is coming through the inspiration it is bringing about to our other students,” he said proudly. 
The festival is also screening what is believed to be Pakistan’s first fan-made Harry Potter film. 
Titled The Last Follower and the Resurrection of Voldemort, the film was made and acted by students and comes with special effects, spells and a gripping storyline. 
“We really thought it would be a crazy idea to change the building, put some mountains around it, create some characters that can go with it,” the film’s director and cinematographer Waleed Akram said. 
He said he was pleased with the film’s reception among students. 
Since the release of the first Harry Potter novel in 1997, the books have found immense popularity, including in Pakistan. 
They have sold over 500 million copies worldwide, in addition to the famous film franchise.

Speaking on the occasion, Mr Policar praised the hotel management for helping boost up the livelihood and skills of Afghan refugees. “Show­casing refugee artisans’ products and linking them to markets or offering internships are great examples of how the private sector can help Afghan refugees,” he said. 
The UNHCR Quetta head said it was important that refugees, wherever they might be, must be given a chance to use their skills to be productive. 
Speaking on the occasion, Mr Rashiduddin said that the aim of the hotel management’s collaboration with UNHCR was to support refugees in achieving self-reliance by providing them technical training in culinary skills, housekeeping and food and beverage services.

4,Fruit trucks exempted from customs scrutiny,QUETTA: The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has directed the customs authorities not to stop and check trucks ...,"QUETTA: The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has directed the customs authorities not to stop and check trucks carrying fresh and dried fruits to other provinces from Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. 
“The vehicles loaded with fresh and dried fruits should not be stopped at the check-posts,” the FBR directive said, adding that customs mobile squads should also not check vehicles carrying fresh and dried fruits for which customs duty had already been paid. 
However, freight vehicles with verified information will be stopped for checking. 
The FBR warned the officials who unnecessarily intercept vehicles carrying fresh / dried fruits of departmental action. 
The Balochistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry had recently complained that freight vehicles were being stopped unnecessarily at various check-posts by customs mobile squads despite paying customs duty. 
The FBR had issued instructions on various occasions to put an end to such activities as these could cause difficulties to traders. 
It said checking of freight vehicles should be conducted only on the basis of information verified by the customs collector, 
Meanwhile, President Fida Hussain Dashti, Senior Vice President Mohammad Ayub Mariani, Vice President Amjad Ali Siddiqui of the Balochistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry welcomed the FBR’s orders and said the step would help boost fresh and dried fruit trade. 
They said this was a long-standing demand of businessmen. “We are grateful to the FBR officials for issuing these orders,” they said.

5,National Party warns against use of force to end Gwadar sit-in,"Party president warns if protesters are thrashed, there will be mass protests in every street of Balochistan.","QUETTA: National Party (NP) president Dr Abdul Malik Baloch has warned against use of force to end sit-in staged by the people of Gwadar to seek their rights.   
“The people of Gwadar have been protesting for three weeks for their basic human rights and needs. All of their demands are legitimate and within the reach of the rulers, but the provincial government imposed by the ‘Thappa mafia’ has no mandate to accept the demands of the people. And now they are planning to end the sit-in by force,” Dr Baloch said. 
“It is still time to try to resolve the issues through dialogue instead of violence,” he said while addressing NP workers at a meeting here on Friday. 
Dr Baloch warned that if the protesters were thrashed, there would be mass protests in every street of Balochistan for which the rulers would be responsible. 
He said that illegal fishing by trawlers, curbs on border trade and unnecessary security check-posts had made the life of the people of Balochistan, particularly Makran, unbearable and as a result there was immense grief and anger among the people.  
The NP chief alleged that the rulers had destroyed Balochistan, particularly the border areas of the province, economically and politically. 
“In the 2018 general elections, the ‘Thappa mafia’ brought in ‘agents’ who want to usurp everything from school funds to marine resources. As a result, all areas adjacent to Pakistan-Iran border have fallen into disrepair,”. 
He said that a drama was being staged to take over the border trade to use it for political purposes and earn bribe from it. 
Dr Baloch said that the federal government by using the irrational term of south Balochistan had declared the region insurgency-affected and claimed that it would start development work worth trillions of rupees in these areas. 
The NP leader said that the people did not consider the elected representatives as their representatives and were not ready to talk to them.

6,Jan Jamali takes oath as Balochistan Assembly speaker,"Says treasury, opposition members should jointly take up province’s issues with Islamabad.","QUETTA: Mir Jan Mohammad Khan Jamali, who was elected speaker of the Balochistan Assembly unopposed, took the oath of his office during a session of the legislature on Friday.  
Mir Jamali could not take oath after being elected last month due to his illness and was admitted to a hospital in Karachi.  
Deputy Speaker Sardar Babar Khan Musakhail, who presided over the session, administered the oath to Mr Jamali as speaker.  
Mir Jan Jamali has previously served as the chief minister, Balochistan Assembly speaker and the deputy chairman of the Senate twice.  

Says treasury, opposition members should jointly take up province’s issues with Islamabad  

Presiding over the session, Mr Jamali said the assembly was an important institution in democracy and “we all should be on one page for maintaining its dignity and honour”. He said efforts would be made for making the house committees more functional where ministers would be called for replying to questions on various issues.  
The speaker emphasised that the treasury and opposition members should jointly go to Islamabad for resolution of issues being faced by the people of Balochistan.  
Giving his ruling on the issue of Reko Diq, which was discussed in the last session where the members expressed concern over the signing of an agreement by the federal government without taking the Balochistan government and the assembly into confidence, the speaker said a parliamentary committee should be formed to discuss the matter and take it up with the Centre.  
Opposition leader Malik Sikander Khan and PTI parliamentary leader Sardar Yar Mohammad Rind congratulated Mir Jan Jamali on his election as speaker.  
Malik Sikander said Mr Jamali was a senior politician who had served the province in different positions. He said lawmakers would get an opportunity to learn a lot from the experience of Mr Jamali.  
Yar Mohammad Rind said the issues relating to Reko Diq and Gwadar were of  a serious nature and needed special attention. He said the people sitting in Islamabad could not resolve these issues and suggested that a ‘truth commission’ be formed under a Supreme Court judge and the chief minister should himself approach the apex court for this purpose.  
Mir Asad Baloch of the Balochistan National Party-Awami said the province’s case should be comprehensively presented at the federal level and “we have to move forward instead of making speeches”. “The Federation should take up Balochistan’s issues in accordamce with the Constitution,” he added.  
Nasarullah Zerey and Malik Naseer Ahmed Shahwani expressed the hope that as a custodian of the house Mir Jan Jamali would protect the lawmakers’ rights.

The 19-member opposition, of which 12 lawmakers belong to the PPP and seven to the PML-N, had requisitioned the session on Nov 23 to “discuss the situation in occupied Kashmir on the one hand and governance-related issues in AJK on the other”. 
However, while two PML-N lawmakers were abroad, another two also failed to make it to the session, prompting the only treasury member in attendance — Minister for Planning and Development Chaudhry Mohammad Rasheed — to point out lack of quorum. 
Interestingly, of the two absentees, PPP’s regional president Chaudhry Mohammad Yasin had already informed his colleagues about his unavailability due to his participation in the party’s election campaign for a by-poll in Lahore. However, Nisara Abbasi of the PML-N literally unnerved the PPP legislators by not showing up at the assembly secretariat on Friday, even though she had attended a joint dinner at the residence of leader of the opposition and PPP leader Chaudhry Latif Akbar on Thursday night to thrash out Friday’s strategy.

9,PM Imran orders legal action over harassment of polio workers,Asks authorities to relocate pollution creating units.,"ISLAMABAD: Lauding the noble service of polio workers and provincial governments for eradication of the crippling disease from the country, Prime Minister Imran Khan on Friday directed the district administrations to take legal action against those harassing and attacking these workers.  
“District administrations should take responsibility to initiate deterrent legal action in cases of harassment of or attacks on polio workers,” the prime minister said while presiding over a meeting held to review arrangements for the coming country-wide polio eradication campaign.  
He was told that southern districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, some districts of Balochistan, including Quetta, Qila Abdullah and Pishin, and some districts of Sindh, including Hyderabad and Karachi, were most vulnerable for the spread of poliovirus through sewage and water.  
He appreciated the provincial governments, district administrations and polio workers for their hard work and efforts for eradication of polio from the country.  

Asks authorities to relocate pollution creating units

“I highly appreciate the hard work done by provincial chief secretaries and deputy commissioners for polio eradication,” he added.  
A number of incidents have taken place in the country in which polio workers were attacked and killed apparently by militants. The incidents took place after a reported ‘fake polio campaign’ was launched in Abbott­abad in 2011 to ‘trace’ Al Qaeda fou­nder Osama bin Laden who was later killed in a US Navy Seals operation in the garrison city on May 2, 2011.  
The prime minister lauded the efforts made by workers of polio eradication teams who reach out to children in far-flung and hard areas of the country. “These workers are performing a national service and deserve special appreciation,” the prime minister said, adding that his special assis­tant on health services Dr Faisal Sultan would come up with a rewards plan for best performing polio workers. He emphasised that low-transmission season was a crucial stage and they all had to act against polio with “killer instincts”.  
The prime minister directed the provincial chief secretaries and deputy commissioners to sustain the polio eradication drive with the same vigour and focus. He called for synergising routine immunisations with the anti-polio campaigns. 
Prime Minister Khan also emphasised the need for maximising efforts for Covid-19 vaccination as a proactive measure against the spread of new variant Omicron. 
The meeting was informed that international organisations were acknowledging the efforts of the government against Covid-19 and polio.  
The meeting was attended by Dr Sultan, Parliamentary Secretary for Health Dr Nausheen Hamid and senior officials. The chief secretaries of Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan and the deputy commissioners of more than 30 districts attended the meeting via video link. 
Pollution creating units
In a separate meeting, Prime Mini-ster Khan directed the federal and provincial authorities to get major industrial units, like brick kilns and steel furnaces, relocated outside cities with effective restrictions.  
The meeting reviewed pollution-related issues in the country and called for incentivising the use of quality fuel and gradual replacement of vehicles run on oil and gas with electric vehicles.  
The prime minister mentioned how developed countries had shifted to modern technology, including conversion of public transport into electric vehicles. He directed that new buses for all metros in the country should be electric vehicles.  
“We must incentivise the industry for shifting their units out of the cities and using modern technology for environment safety,” he added.  
The prime minister directed the Punjab government to adopt a comprehensive smog control policy at the earliest. He directed the federal government and provincial governments of Punjab and KP to work on a short-, medium- and long-term comprehensive plan for forward-looking policies with timelines for implementation.
Earlier, the prime minister was briefed that vehicles, industrial units and burning of waste material and stubble were major sources of air pollution. The prime minister also stressed the need for dialogue with regional countries to protect environment through collective efforts. 
Bakhtiar meets PM
Federal Minister for Industries and Production Makhdoom Khusro Bakht­iar called on Prime Minister Khan and briefed him about the capacity of fertiliser production in the country.  
He also briefed the prime minister about the measures taken by the Ministry of Industries and Production to facilitate the large-scale manufacturing sector and export industry.  
The prime minister was also apprised of the progress on ongoing development projects in south Punjab and positive effects of the steps taken by the government for farmers.  
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Khan directed the authorities concerned to make the system of community welfare attaches effective and operational to ensure the welfare and betterment of overseas Pakistanis — a precious asset for the country.  
The prime minister was talking to his adviser on overseas Pakistanis Ayub Khan Afridi, who called on him.  
Matters relating to dual nationality with Spain and the issuance of visa for Pakistanis living abroad without Pakistan-origin card were also discussed during the meeting.  
Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee Gen Nadeem Raza and Director General of Strategic Plans Division Lt Gen Nadeem Zaki Manj also met the prime minister.  
Professional matters pertaining to defence of the country were discussed during the meeting.
