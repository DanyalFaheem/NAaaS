0,Deadlock persists over schools’ reopening in Islamabad despite minister’s intervention,Shafqat Mahmood hopeful about resumption of classes from Monday.,"ISLAMABAD: Though protesting teachers on Friday showed some flexibility after Education Minister Shafqat Mahmood gave them a patient hearing but the deadlock persisted and the protesters announced that boycott of classes would continue until the government amended the Local Government Ordinance 2021.
The minister held a meeting with the action committee of teaching and non-teaching staff of schools.
After the meeting, the minister tweeted: “Met representatives of Islamabad Teachers to discuss the issue of placing the Federal Directorate of Education (FDE) under the mayor. Hopefully classes will resume by Monday.” 

 



 
The delegation of teachers after meeting the minister told Dawn that there was still a deadlock as they wanted to get two notifications issued by the ministry - one related to the withdrawal/amendment to section 166 of the Local Government Act 2021 and the other regarding merger of 33 colleges with FDE.

Shafqat Mahmood hopeful about resumption of classes from Monday

They said during the meeting, the minster’s response was very positive and he assured the teachers that he would play his role in amending section 166 of the ordinance.
However, they said after the meeting when the teachers sought written assurance from the relevant officials in accordance with the assurance of the minister, they refused anything in writing.
“The minister assured us in the meeting that he would play his role to remove our concerns and the ministry will also move an amendment to section 166 of the ordinance. But as soon as the minister left his office, we sought a written assurance from the officers concerned but they did not give us anything in writing. So there is no outcome of the meeting,” said President Federal Government Teachers Association Malik Ameer Khan,.
Meanwhile, a statement issued by spokesperson for the action committee, Yousaf Zia, said: “The education minister wants to resolve our issue but elements are trying to create hurdles. So our strike will continue till our demands are met.”
All 390 schools of Islamabad are currently closed for an indefinite period as teaching and non-teaching staff have launched their protest against placement of the FDE under the local government.
The ordinance, which was issued last week, drew criticism from teachers and other employees of schools.
Rejecting the ordinance, the teachers closed down schools on Tuesday for an indefinite period, demanding the government withdraw its decision to place the schools under the mayor.
On the other hand, until November 22, the FDE was supposed to regulate 423 schools and colleges in Islamabad but in a surprise move, two days before the approval of the ordinance, the education ministry through a notification put the 33 college including around 20 school-cum-colleges under another college of the ministry, but left the 390 schools under FDE for their devolution to local government.
Sources said the teachers during their meeting with the minister pleaded that the notification to separate the 33 colleges from schools should be withdrawn immediately and the minister should give a written assurance to teachers regarding amendment to section 166 of the ordinance with a timeline.
The sources said late on Friday night that another meeting was scheduled between the teachers and officers of the ministry on Saturday or Sunday in which there were chances the ministry would present its final point of view in writing to resolve the issue.

11,No end to dengue cases in Rawalpindi,Official says health authority started the dengue spray late.,"RAWALPINDI: Despite the onset of winter season, dengue patients are still reporting in government hospitals speaking volume about measures taken by the District Health Authority for elimination of the mosquitoes.
A senior official of the district administration told Dawn that the health authority started the dengue spray late after the end of monsoon in mid-September and it was the main reason the dengue mosquitoes could not be eliminated in low-lying areas.
He said Rawalpindi Cantonment Board (RCB) and Chaklala Cantonment Board (CCB) were also responsible for the delayed work to eliminate dengue larvae. Most of the people in cantonment areas were affected by the dengue virus.
He said due to the local government elections, the cantonment boards did not pay attention on the dengue spray and started the work after September 12.
“Cantonment General Hospital (CGH) failed to make arrangements for the dengue patients and as a result all patients reported from cantonment areas landed in the Holy Family Hospital (HFH), Benazir Bhutto Hospital (BBH) and District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital,” he said.
It may be mentioned that former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi had provided Rs570 million to the RCB for the renovation of the CGH to cater to the civilian population of the cantonments but the hospital failed to provide facilities to the dengue and Covid-19 patients.
On the other hand, a senior doctor at the HFH requesting not to be named said the three government hospitals had allocated beds for dengue patients. All Covid-19 patients were transferred from HFH to the Rawalpindi Institute of Urology (RIU) so that doctors could pay full attention on the virus contracted patients there.
He said mostly patients arrived from the cantonment area and low-lying localities adjacent to Leh Nullah and Islamabad. He said the dengue virus was still active in some areas.
Meanwhile, total four dengue patients arrived in the three hospitals on Friday, taking the tally to 3,772.
According to data of the Punjab government, one patient arrived at the HFH and three in at the BBH.
Besides, five patients were in critical condition. As many as 3,772 denguepatients reported at the three government hospitals in the current season - 2,000 patients at HFH, 1,201 at BBH and 571 in the DHQ hospital.
At present, 18 patients are admitted in the three hospitals - 13 in the HFH and five in the BBH.

She symbolises the ‘bad women’ metaphorically for those brave women who challenge patriarchy, raise their voice against social injustices and brutalities. The launching ceremony of Ms Naheed’s book Buri Aurat Ki Doosri Katha (bad woman’s second story) was organised by the Indus Forum of Writers and Intellectuals (IFWI) in collaboration with the National Press Club (NPC). 
The book, a sequel to Ms Naheed’s autobiography Buri Aurat Ki Katha (bad woman’s story), is an indictment of the patriarchal society that brutalises women in the name of customs, religion and ‘honour’ to subjugate and oppress them.
Shoaib Sultan Khan, one of the rural development gurus of South Asia, in his presidential address was all praise for the poet, saying her books opened his eyes about women empowerment in a real sense. 
Senator Krishna Kumari said the book is a slap on the face of those retrogressive forces who oppose women’s right to work, education and equal space. 
This was echoed by journalist and columnist Wajahat Masaud who recalled I. A. Rahman’s quote that a democratic society could not be established without the emancipation and participation of women.
Dr Nazir Mahmood said Ms Naheed’s new book is an account of her struggles through life as a young poet and the challenges.
This was also echoed by the poet’s friend and short story writer Nayyar Iqbal.
Painter and activist Samar Minallah said Ms Naheed’s poetry is the source of inspiration and a beacon in the darkness for women and girls.
Poet and HRCP secretary general Harris Khalique said Ms Naheed is one of the pioneers of feminist movement and resistance poetry who defied all odds, continued to push boundaries and gained space for their expression in the patriarchal world.
Social activist and writer Zafarullah Khan said the book encapsulates her journey from Bulandshahr to Islamabad and the chequered history of Pakistan.
IIUI lecturer Amina Bibi read a paper on the life and work of Ms Naheed and said her book negates the stereotypes about and ethos of women.
IFWI head Qasim Boggio, who conducted the event, shared the objective of the forum to celebrate those writers and poets who feel the social injustices.
PFUJ General Secretary Nasir Zaidi, NPC President Shakeel Anjum and poet Sajjad Lakha also paid tributes to her.
Ms Naheed expressed her gratitude to the organisers and speakers for arranging the event to share love, adding that she was disturbed with rising extremism in society. 
She said how could a socially conscious writer and poet remain indifferent to injustices and violence against weaker segments of society.
