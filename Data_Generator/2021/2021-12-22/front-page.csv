• PM to personally monitor local bodies elections in future
• Minister says emergence of JUI-F, TLP unfortunate      
ISLAMABAD: Terming the re-emergence of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) and Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) “unfortunate” and “harmful” for the country, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government on Tuesday confessed that faulty strategy had led to its defeat in the first phase of local government (LG) elections in its stronghold, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.  
The government admitted that fielding “wrong” candidates and lack of unity among them was the main reason behind the success of the “religious extremist” political party.  
Prime Minister Imran Khan also vowed to personally monitor the LG polls in the country in future. 
In his tweet, PM Khan said: “PTI made mistakes in 1st phase of KP LG elections & paid the price. Wrong candidate selection was a major cause. From now on I will personally be overseeing PTI’s LG election strategy in 2nd phase of KP LG elections & LG elections across Pak. Insha Allah PTI will come out stronger.”  
Speaking at his post-cabinet meeting press conference, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said the rise of “religious extremist” political parties such as the recently unbanned TLP and the JUI-F would ultimately harm the country. 
The minister, however, said despite its defeat, the PTI was still the only “national party” in the country.  
He claimed that the recently-concluded local bodies polls in KP did not come under discussion in the cabinet meeting, adding that the prime minister would soon call a meeting of the PTI’s core committee to discuss the recently-held elections.  
The JUI-F managed to grab the highest number of mayor/chairman seats in the elections on Sunday.  
According to provisional results of the 39 tehsils out of 63 declared by the Election Commission of Pakistan, the JUI-F not only won 15 seats of mayor/chairman but also gave a tough fight in many other tehsils where its candidates were runners-up.  
In the provincial capital, the JUI-F stunned the PTI and has a definitive lead in the contest for the mayor of Peshawar city. 
JUI-F candidate Haji Zubair Ali secured 62,388 votes against 50,659 votes won by PTI’s Rizwan Bangash.  
Of the remaining six tehsil chairman seats of Peshawar, the JUI-F managed to clinch four while the PTI could bag one seat.  
Earlier, Fawad Chaudhry tried to skip the issue of PTI’s defeat in the LG elections but after back-to-back queries from reporters on the matter, the minister gave reasons of the ruling party’s failure. 
“When three to four candidates from the same party contest the polls in the same constituency, they will [inevitably] lose the election. This is what happened in most areas,” he said, adding that the party’s MNAs and MPAs were also not happy.  
“Each constituency needs to be managed, and we lost most of the contests due to mismanagement,” he added.  
However, “this just proves that the PTI is a national party while the rest are merely local parties”, the minister said, adding that “if the PTI did not exist, there would be no national party in the country”.  
Talking about the JUI-F, Mr Chaudhry said the party had ruined education and finance sectors in KP in 2002. 
“It is unfortunate that, due to our mistakes, such a political party has been noticed [by the people],” he said, adding that the rise of “religious extremist parties” such as the TLP and JUI-F would ultimately harm the country.  
The minister said the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) no longer had any standing in the political arena.  
“Pakistan will be affected if the PTI faces setbacks and such ‘political dwarfs’ get the chance to step into the limelight,” Mr Chaudhry said. 
He also called on PTI leaders to strengthen party chief Imran Khan, saying that “without Imran Khan, politics in Pakistan will scatter into pieces”.  
The minister said he was “disappointed” at the fact that the JUI-F had bagged the highest number of seats in the first phase of the local government elections in KP but expressed the hope that the party’s leadership would learn from the current situation. 
“Such parties are a sign of a retrogressive society and a sign that things in the country are not fine. It is not a reassuring thing for society when people who are against women’s rights, against [basic] freedoms [...] come into power,” he said, terming JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman’s coming into power “unfortunate”.  
“In such a situation, PTI leadership and workers should put aside their personal differences and organise themselves under the leadership of PM Khan. At this time if PTI becomes weak, the country will fall into the trap of those having evil designs,” he said.  
Responding to a query about the recent remarks made by former president and PPP co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari in which he apparently asked the establishment to remove the current government and give his party [PPP] a chance, Mr Chaudhry said: “Zardari’s remarks hinted that no deal has so far taken place and he [Zardari] was seeking establishment’s help.”

1,Shehbaz needs Nawaz’s nod to vie for PM office: Maryam,Says NAB using delaying tactics in court as it has no proof against her.,"ISLAMABAD: Leader of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Maryam Nawaz has said it will be heartening for her to see party president Shehbaz Sharif as prime minister of Pakistan but it is subject to the approval of the party’s supreme leader, Nawaz Sharif.
Talking to journalists after attending the hearing of her appeal by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in the Avenfield Apartment reference on Tuesday, Ms Nawaz said the party leadership, including Mr Shehbaz himself, had authorised the party supremo to make a final decision on the candidature for the top slot.
In response to a question whether it would be acceptable for her to see Mr Shehbaz in the PM Office, the party vice president said: “Shehbaz Sharif is a fatherly figure, he is president of the PML-N, but the decision on his candidature is to be taken by the party leadership.”
The statement came a week after ex-premier Shahid Khaqan Abbasi clarified that his comment about Mr Shehbaz being the party’s candidate for prime minister’s slot (in the next general elections) must not be construed as a message to the military establishment about consensus on his nomination. 

Says NAB using delaying tactics in court as it has no proof against her

“I had said this in the context that the party president usually is the candidate for prime minister’s slot. However, a final decision in this regard will be taken by the party leadership under its Quaid Nawaz Sharif at the time of the elections,” he had maintained.
Talking about the recent local government elections in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Ms Nawaz told the media that the incumbent Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government had already made a history of losing consecutive by-elections in almost every constituency. She said the government broke all previous records of bad governance due to which the PTI ticket had become a symbol of disgrace. She said the PTI was facing public wrath owing to skyrocketing inflation.
She took a jibe at the PTI dismal performance in the polls, advising those planning to contest elections on PTI’s ticket in future to wear helmet in public gatherings as people would not going to tolerate them anymore.
Ms Nawaz said Prime Minister Imran Khan should tender public apology for his poor performance and resign from PM Office. Everyone, even PTI’s own lawmakers, were not ready to back him, she said, adding that they had to criticise their own government in TV shows over unprecedented price hike.
She greeted Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman for securing majority seats in the local government elections in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. 
Responding to another question, the PML-N vice president said rehabilitation of Afghanistan was collective responsibility of the international community.
At the outset, she briefed the media about the court proceedings. She said the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) filed application before the IHC seeking adjournment over the ailment of a prosecutor. She recalled the same NAB had asked courts to hear the case against her on a daily basis even if her ailing counsel had to be brought before court on a stretcher. “The time has changed, the days of their hegemony are over now and they are seeking adjournments on one pretext or another,” she added.
She claimed that NAB had no evidence against her. It for this reason that the bureau had started using delaying tactics in courts, she remarked.
Earlier at the hearing, the anti-graft watchdog filed an application before the IHC informing it of the prosecutor’s ailment and sought adjournment. 
Subsequently, the IHC division bench comprising Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani adjourned the proceedings till January 18, 2022.

2,"NA panel slams govt for high energy prices, shortages",SSGCL says it faces about 100 million cubic feet per day of gas shortage in Dec which could go up to 280mmcfd in Jan.,"ISLAMABAD: Amid criticism from parliamentarians over an acute gas crisis, the Ministry of Energy on Tuesday conceded that non-availability of even a single bid against tenders for import of eight LNG cargoes, stay orders secured by industries against rationing and pricing challenges were key reasons behind gas shortage.
At a meeting of the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Petroleum presided over by Junaid Akbar, the Petroleum Division came under severe criticism over gas shortages across the country and price hike of petroleum products.
The acting director general of gas told the committee that keeping in view the gas requirement, the government had invited tenders in October for eight LNG cargoes to meet peak winter demand but no bidder turned up. He said the country also did not have gas storage capacity otherwise advance imports could be arranged in lean period.
A senior official of the Petroleum Division reported that it had fielded a technical study for development of underground gas storage so that the issue could be tackled permanently. He said the gas pricing was also a major challenge because there was no law on determination of imported gas and the matter was being dealt with under an ad hoc mechanism.
He said 58pc of Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd consumers belonged to the residential sector and the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) law would have to be  amended for creation of gas basket for imported LNG. It was reported that gas cut had been applied to CNG, cement and captive power plants of the industrial sector and supply cuts were now also affecting the power sector.
On a question on gas shortages in Karachi, the committee was informed by the representatives of Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd (SSGCL) that the company faced about 100 million cubic feet per day of gas shortage in December which could go up to 280mmcfd in January.
He said the SSGCL was following the gas load management plan approved by the federal government. However, the industries in Karachi had secured stay orders against load management, constraining the gas utility to ensure full gas supplies to residential consumers. He said Karachi was also facing higher shortages because of increased demand in Balochistan, particularly in Quetta due to extreme cold weather.
While answering to the committee regarding price hikes in petroleum products, the Petroleum Division officials stated the government was constrained to raise prices due to international rise in the prices. The members said the prices of petroleum products were raised substantially but reductions were only peanuts.
The committee inquired from Ogra chairman Masroor Khan whether there was any political pressure on him or the Ogra officials regarding their official functional commitments who categorically reported that there was no pressure at all and the Ogra members and staff were performing their duties within respective rules and regulations.
The committee deferred the bill ‘The Petroleum (Amendment) Bill 2021 (Govt Bill)’ as the Petroleum Division sought more time to complete the consultation process with relevant stakeholders.

3,"Freight train launched to link Istanbul with Tehran, Islamabad",Railways minister says passenger train service will also start soon.,"ISLAMABAD: A freight train service was inaugurated here on Tuesday with an aim to boost trade between Pakistan, Iran and Turkey.  
Minister for Railways Azam Khan Swati, along with Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Adviser to the Prime Minister on Commerce Abdul Razak Dawood, inaugurated the Islamabad-Tehran-Istanbul (ITI) freight train at Margalla railway station. Ambassadors of Turkey, Iran, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan were also present on the occasion.  
The freight train service will play a vital role in improving the economies and lives of citizens of ECO member states by maximising economic efficiency and reducing the cost of doing business.  
Railways Minister Swati highlighted the importance of ITI freight train and said this service would open doors for business and connectivity in the region. “The passenger train service will also start soon,” he said, adding: “We have opened our trade routes and it is a great opportunity for importers and exporters.”  
Terming the ITI freight train an important milestone in Pakistan’s history, the minister said that business-to-business contact among the business community would further enhance through this train. He said the service would further strengthen relations between the three countries.  
Razak Dawood said regional connectivity was one of very important pillars of Pakistan’s strategic trade policy framework and it was heartening to witness the resumption of operations of ITI freight train.  
Foreign Minister Qureshi appreciated the resumption of ITI freight train and said the service would play an important role in regional connectivity and promoting economic activity in the region.  
Turkish Ambassador Mustafa Yurdakul expressed the hope that the train service would not stop at Istanbul only but go all the way to Europe which would benefit all regional countries as the economies bounced back in the post-Covid era.  
According to Pakistan Railways, the first train from Islamabad to Istanbul was inaugurated on August 14, 2009. Similarly, the first train from Istanbul reached the Islamabad dry port on August 13, 2010.  
So far eight trains have been dispatched from Pakistan to Turkey, with the last leaving the Lahore dry port on November 5, 2011. Since the launch of the service in 2009, Turkey has sent six trains to Pakistan, with the last one reaching here on December 9, 2011.  
ITI freight train will be operated regularly on Tuesday of every week. The freight train had nine wagons initially, said a senior railway official.  
As per present arrangement to start the train and the schedule agreed jointly by Turkey, Iran and Pakistan, the running time between Drence-Kapikoy (Istanbul) and Zahidan-Tabraiz (Iran) will be 90 hours each. From Zahidan to Islamabad, the train would take 135.5 hours.

4,PM Imran takes veiled swipe at US for Afghan turmoil,Terms Pakistan’s decision to join war on terror ‘a self-inflicted wound’.,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Tuesday made veiled criticism of the United States for creating in Afghanistan a humanitarian crisis that is affecting millions of people and allowing it to worsen.
“A man-made crisis is being created despite knowing that it can be averted if (Afghanistan’s) accounts (in the US) are unfrozen and liquidity is put into their banking system,” PM Khan said while speaking at a ceremony held at Foreign Office to celebrate the successful holding of the extraordinary session of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation’s (OIC) Council of Foreign Ministers.
The humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan caused by drought and decades of conflict has been aggravated by the economic crunch resulting from US sanctions and assets freeze after Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan.

Terms Pakistan’s decision to join war on terror ‘a self-inflicted wound’

The US has frozen nearly $9.5 billion of Afghan reserves in American banks on the pretext that court rulings in cases filed by the victims of 9/11 and those who suffered because of the Taliban required the executive to do so. Washington has indicated that it may show greater flexibility about sanctions on Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, but that frozen funds cannot be released.
The OIC CFM was held to deliberate on the growing crisis in Afghanistan and the 57-member Muslim bloc decided to set up a Humanitarian Trust Fund that is expected to channel aid to the war-ravaged country. A food security programme is also being initiated.
Mr Khan said dealing with the crisis in Afghanistan would need a “constant struggle”. At the same time, he laid emphasis on the urgency of the crisis-like situation saying “time was of the essence”.
The prime minister appreciated the FO for increased global support for Pakistan’s stance on Afghanistan. He then criticised the foreign policy pursued by the past governments, especially the decision to join the war on terror, which he described as “a self-inflicted wound”.
He regretted that the past governments compromised national interest and dignity to get foreign aid. While making the policies in the past under consideration was not the interest of people, as the goal much like participation in the Afghan jihad was to earn dollars, he added.
Mr Khan, however, asked the FO to orientate towards geo-economics to improve the country’s standing. He noted that Pakistan’s image in the world had improved despite the economic challenges it faced and the global Covid-19 pandemic.
Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi mentioned the reforms undertaken at the FO, including digitisation, automation of the processes, changes in rules and procedures, strengthening of the Foreign Service Academy and Institute of Strategic Studies and launch of FM Direct and FM Portal.
According to him, Pakistan is now all set to host the 48th regular session of OIC Council of Foreign Ministers in March.
