0,"14 dead, 70,000 displaced by floods in Malaysia","Thousands of emergency service and military personnel have been mobilised, but critics say it is not enough.","SHAH ALAM: The Malaysian military used boats on Tuesday to distribute food to desperate people trapped in their homes after massive floods, as the death toll rose to 14 with over 70,000 displaced.
Days of torrential rain triggered some of the worst flooding in years across the country at the weekend, swamping cities and villages and cutting off major roads.
Selangor — the country’s wealthiest and most densely populated state, encircling the capital Kuala Lumpur — is one of the worst-hit areas.
Some parts of state capital Shah Alam were still under water on Tuesday, and military personnel in boats distributed food to people stuck in their homes and government shelters.
Kartik Subramany fled his house as floodwaters rose, and took refuge in a school for 48 hours before being evacuated with his family to a shelter.
“My house is totally damaged, my two cars are wrecked,” the 29-year-old said.
“These are the worst floods of my entire life. The federal government has failed the people miserably — it has failed in its primary function to protect and safeguard lives.” He is among a growing number attacking what they say is a slow and inadequate official response.
Thousands of emergency service and military personnel have been mobilised, but critics say it is not enough and volunteers have stepped in to provide food and boats for the rescue effort. 
A journalist in one hard-hit Shah Alam neighbourhood saw people desperate for food snatching items from a devastated supermarket.
Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob admitted on Tuesday there were  “weaknesses” in the response to the disaster and pledged there would be improvements in future.
“The responsibility is not that of the federal government alone, but also the state governments,” he added, noting a month’s rainfall had come down in a single day in Selangor.
Opposition MP Fuziah Salleh described the official response as  “hopeless” and  “incompetent”.
“No early warning of the torrential rain was given,” she said.  “It is so sad lives have been lost.” Opposition politicians have accused the government of ignoring their calls to better prepare for the monsoon season, from November to February, particularly by improving drainage in densely populated urban areas.
On Tuesday, the death toll from the floods rose to 14, including eight in Selangor and six in the eastern state of Pahang, official news agency Bernama reported.
But with reports of people still missing, it is expected to increase. More than 71,000 people have been forced from their homes due to the floods, including 41,000 in Pahang and 27,000 in Selangor, according to official data.
Evacuees are being housed in government relief centres but officials have warned to expect a rise in coronavirus cases linked to the crowded shelters. The rain has stopped and in many areas floodwaters have receded, leaving residents to count the cost.
“I’ve been doing business for more than 24 years... this has never happened before,” said Mohammad Awal, whose cosmetic shop outside Kuala Lumpur was flooded.
The Southeast Asian nation is hit by floods annually during the monsoon season, but those at the weekend were the worst since 2014 when over 100,000 people were forced from their homes.
Global warming has been linked to worsening floods. Because a warmer atmosphere holds more water, climate change increases the risk and intensity of flooding from extreme rainfall.

1,Madagascar minister swims 12 hours to shore after helicopter crash,ANTANANARIVO: A Madagascan minister was one of two survivors to have swum some 12 hours to shore on Tuesday after...,"ANTANANARIVO: A Madagascan minister was one of two survivors to have swum some 12 hours to shore on Tuesday after their helicopter crashed off the island’s northeastern coast, authorities said.
A search was still ongoing for two other passengers after the crash on Monday, whose cause was not immediately clear, police and port authorities said.
Serge Gelle, the country’s secretary of state for police, and a fellow policeman reached land in the seaside town of Mahambo separately on Tuesday morning, apparently after ejecting themselves from the aircraft, port authority chief Jean-Edmond Randrianantenaina said. In a video shared on social media, 57-year-old Gelle appears lying exhausted on a deck chair, still in his camouflage uniform.
“My time to die hasn’t come yet,” says the general, adding he is cold but not injured. The helicopter was flying him and the others to inspect the site of a shipwreck off the northeastern coast on Monday morning.
At least 39 people died in that disaster, police chief Zafisambatra Ravoavy said Tuesday, in an increase from a previous toll after rescue workers retrieved 18 more bodies.
Ravoavy earlier said that Gelle had used one of the helicopter’s seats as a flotation device.
“He has always had great stamina in sport, and he’s kept up this rhythm as minister, just like a thirty-year-old,” he said. “He has nerves of steel.” Gella became minister as part of a cabinet reshuffle in August after serving in the police for three decades.

2,China to give women right to decide on caesarean birth,"Currently, a hospital can only let a pregnant woman deliver by caesarean section if her husband approves.","BEIJING: China will give pregnant women the right to chose a caesarean birth for babies even if husbands object, state media reported on Tuesday, one of the latest steps to safeguard women’s rights in a society in which traditions can play a powerful role.
China’s top law-making body, the standing committee of parliament, is meeting this week to discuss bills, including a draft amendment to the Women’s Rights and Interests Protection Law, which was first passed in 1992.
He Yiting, a parliament official for societal issues, said that while the law had been in place for years, some old problems had not been resolved while some new ones had arisen as society and the economy progressed, the Beijing News reported.
Currently, a hospital can only let a pregnant women deliver by caesarean section if her husband approves.
Under the law, women are supposed to enjoy equal rights but in reality their options and decisions on getting married, having children or having a career are often constrained by pressure from the family or authorities.
For decades China imposed a tough one-child policy aimed at limiting population growth.
Some Chinese families believe that caesarean-sections can harm the baby and the mother will take longer to recover from the birth, possibly delaying the time when she’s ready to have another baby.

3,Putin warns West of military measures over Ukraine threats,The Russian president has for weeks accused the United States and Nato of stoking tensions near Moscow’s borders.,"MOSCOW: President Vladimir Putin warned on Tuesday that Russia was prepared to take military steps in response to  “unfriendly” Western actions over the Ukraine conflict, in a sharp escalation of rhetoric.
The Russian president has for weeks accused the United States and the Washington-led Nato military alliance of stoking tensions near Moscow’s borders, but these were his first comments hinting at potential conflict.
Putin told defence ministry officials that if the West continued its  “obviously aggressive stance” Russia would take  “appropriate retaliatory military-technical measures”.
Russia  “will react toughly to unfriendly steps”, he said, adding that he wanted to underscore that,  “we have every right to do so”.
The United States has been sounding the alarm since mid-November that Moscow could be planning a large-scale attack on its ex-Soviet neighbour Ukraine and has warned Putin of unprecedented sanctions.
Western governments have accused Moscow of amassing some 100,000 troops near its border with eastern Ukraine, where Kiev has been fighting pro-Russia separatists since 2014.
Russia denies plotting an invasion and has demanded legal guarantees over its security from the United States and Nato, demanding the alliance stop an eastward expansion.
Last week Moscow presented demands to the United States and Nato saying the alliance must not admit new members or establish military bases in ex-Soviet countries.
Putin said that Russia was  “extremely concerned” over what he said was US missile deployments in Poland and Romania, which he said would soon be capable of launching Tomahawk cruise missiles.
“If this infrastructure moves further — if US and Nato missile systems appear in Ukraine — then their approach time to Moscow will be reduced to seven or 10 minutes,” he said, adding that the time would be cut even shorter with hypersonic weapons. Despite hinting at conflict, Putin said that Russia wants to avoid  “bloodshed”.
“We want to resolve issues by political and diplomatic means,” he said.
But the Russian leader repeated grievances over Washington’s support for Ukraine, which includes training Kiev’s forces and committing to them more than $2.5 billion.
Those actions, Putin said, are taking place  “at the doorstep of our house”.
Even if Moscow receives US security guarantees, Putin said he would be wary of them because  “the United States easily withdraws from all international treaties that for one reason or another become uninteresting to them”.
The West has warned that Putin could use the pretext of provocations in Ukraine to launch a full-scale attack.
Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu accused Washington of plotting  “provocations” in eastern Ukraine. He said US mercenaries had brought  “reserves of an unknown chemical component” to two Ukrainian towns on the frontline of the war with separatists.
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky meanwhile voiced frustration over Nato’s reluctance to speed up Kiev’s membership in the alliance.

4,UK court orders Dubai ruler to pay ‘record’ $730 million in divorce settlement,LONDON: The ruler of Dubai was on Tuesday ordered to pay his former wife ...,"

SHEIKH Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum.—AFP

 
LONDON: The ruler of Dubai was on Tuesday ordered to pay his former wife and children around $730 million in what is thought to be the highest divorce settlement set by an English court. 
Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum was told he must pay Princess Haya Bint Al Hussein, a half-sister of Jordan’s King Abdullah II, a lump sum of 251.5 million pounds and provide a bank guarantee of 290m to cover children’s maintenance and security as adults. 
The 72-year-old ruler of the emirate of Dubai has long been locked in a bitter legal battle with his 47-year-old former wife, who lives in London with their two children, aged 13 and nine.
The High Court ruled in October this year that the sheikh had authorised the use of spying software to hack his ex-wife’s phone, and a judge said he had “harassed and intimidated (her) both before her departure to England and since”.
Judge Philip Moor in his divorce settlement ruling said that Sheikh Mohammed had “accepted that his wealth was sufficient to meet any reasonable order”.
His spokesperson said afterwards that the Sheikh “has always ensured that his children are provided for” and “the court has now made its ruling on finances and he does not intend to comment further”. 
Previously the largest settlement was approximately 450 million to Tatiana Akhmedova, the ex-wife of a Russian billionaire, in 2016.
The case was held behind closed doors in the Family Division of the High Court of England and Wales.
Sheikh Mohammed, who is also vice-president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, last year failed in a legal bid to block publication of its judgments.
He had applied to the High Court for the summary return of the children to Dubai.
The couple married in 2004 in Sheikh Mohammed’s second official marriage.
He divorced Princess Haya under Sharia law in 2019, without her knowledge, according to the court judgment.
She and her children live in a house near Kensington Palace and on an estate west of London that she inherited from her father, the late king Hussein of Jordan.
The High Court ruled in 2020 that the Sheikh had submitted Princess Haya, an Olympic equestrian, to a “campaign of fear and intimidation”, forcing her to flee to London.
A judge also ruled that the Sheikh had forcibly returned home two of his older daughters, Shamsa and Latifa, forcing them to remain in Dubai.
Latifa, who made an unsuccessful attempt to flee the emirate in March 2018, went on to allege she was held “hostage” in one of his palaces and feared for her life.
In a statement after the publication of the rulings, Sheikh Mohammed strongly denied the claims.
The Sheikh has a close relationship with Queen Elizabeth II, sharing her love of horse racing. His family operates stables in the UK and other countries.

5,Former German minister becomes mayor of Berlin,"BERLIN: Franziska Giffey, a former federal minister who quit Germany’s national government earlier this year,...","BERLIN: Franziska Giffey, a former federal minister who quit Germany’s national government earlier this year, became Berlin’s new mayor on Tuesday as the leader of a three-party left-wing governing coalition.
Giffey was elected by the state legislature nearly three months after a regional election in which she led her center-left Social Democrats, the party of new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, to a narrow victory over the environmentalist Greens.
Giffey, 43, served as minister for women and families in ex-Chancellor Angela Merkel’s last government until she resigned in May amid allegations of plagiarism in her doctoral thesis. She was later stripped of her doctorate, but stuck to her longstanding plan to run for mayor.
She said at the time that she wrote the thesis to the best of my ability and mistakes she made weren’t intentional or planned.
Giffey was already well known to Berliners before she joined the national government in 2018 as the popular mayor of the German capital’s Neukoelln district, which has a high poverty rate and many families with an immigrant background.
As Berlin mayor, she has identified housing as a top priority. Rising rents have long been a top issue in Berlin. Giffey’s new government will have to decide what to do with the result of a nonbinding September referendum in which voters backed a call for the local administration to expropriate about 240,000 apartments from corporate owners. Giffey’s coalition with the Greens and the Left Party isn’t united on that issue. It has tasked an expert commission to make a recommendation.

6,Ex-intelligence chief admits Israel’s role in Soleimani’s assassination,JERUSALEM: Israel’s former military intelligence chief says the country was involved in the American air strike...,"JERUSALEM: Israel’s former military intelligence chief says the country was involved in the American air strike that killed Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in January 2020. 
It was apparently the first public acknowledgement of Israel’s role in the operation. 
Gen Soleimani headed the Iranian Revolutionary Gua­rd’s elite Quds Force and helped orchestrate Iran’s involvement with paramilitary groups abroad. He was killed in a US drone strike at the Baghdad airport in Janu­ary 2020, an incident that threatened to pull the countries into full-blown conflict. 
A week after the air strike, NBC News reported that Israeli intelligence helped confirm the details of Soleimani’s flight from Damascus to Baghdad. Earlier this year, a Yahoo News reported that Israel had access to Soleimani’s numbers and gave that intelligence to the United States. 
But Maj Gen Tamir Heyman, the now-retired general who headed military intelligence until October, appears to be the first official to confirm Israel’s involvement. 
Heyman’s comments were published in the November issue of a Hebrew-language magazine closely affiliated with Israel’s intelligence services. The interview was held in late September, a couple of weeks before his retirement from the military. 
The authors wrote that Heyman opened the interview by talking about the American air strike that killed Soleimani, but in which Israeli intelligence played a part. 
“Assassinating Soleimani was an achievement, since our main enemy, in my eyes, are the Iranians,” Heyman told the magazine. He said there were “two significant and important assassinations during my term as head of army intelligence. 
“The first, as I’ve already recalled, is that of Qassem Soleimani — it’s rare to locate someone so senior, who is the architect of the fighting force, the strategist and the operator — it’s rare,” he said. 
Heyman called Soleimani the “engine of the train of Iranian entrenchment” in neighbouring Syria. 
Israel has carried out hundreds of air strikes in Syria in the past decade, but rarely has it publicly comments on them. Israel has said, however, that it has targeted bases of Iranian-backed force and arms shipments bound for Iran’s proxy, the Lebanese Shia militia Hezbollah. 
Heyman claimed that Israeli strikes had succeeded in preventing the attempt by Iran to put down roots in Syria. 
The Israeli military did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Heyman’s remarks. 
The interview was published as world powers and Iran were engaged in negotiations to reach a new agreement to curb Iran’s nuclear programme. The previous deal, struck in 2015, unraveled after the United States unilaterally withdrew in 2018 and re-imposed crippling economic sanctions on Iran.

7,"Spend on education, not weapons, says pope",Calls for a better balance between a free market economy and the need to help the needy and protect the environment.,"VATICAN CITY: Nations should divert money spent on armaments to invest in education, Pope Francis said in a yearly peace message, decrying growing military costs at the expense of social services.
In his message issued on Tuesday for the Roman Catholic Church’s World Day of Peace, which is celebrated on Jan 1, Pope Francis also called for a better balance between a free market economy and the need to help the needy and protect the environment.
He dedicated about a third of the four-page message to education, saying there had been a  “significant reduction” in education and training spending worldwide while military expenditure had increased beyond the levels at the end of the Cold War and  “seem certain to grow exorbitantly”. He did not give any sources for the statistics.
“It is high time, then, that governments develop economic policies aimed at inverting the proportion of public funds spent on education and on weaponry,” he said in the message, which is sent to heads of state and international organisations.
“The pursuit of a genuine process of international disarmament can only prove beneficial for the development of peoples and nations, freeing up financial resources better used for health care, schools, infrastructure, care of the land and so forth,” he said.
The proportions of military and education spending differ from country to country, but positions on what to increase and what to cut often follow partisan lines.
A poll by the Pew Research Center in 2019 showed that in the United States, 84pc of Democrats favoured more spending on education versus 56 percent of Republicans and that 56pc of Republicans wanted more military spending as opposed to 26pc of Democrats.
Pope Francis has called for disarmament, a ban on nuclear weapons and has said that military funds should also be diverted into the fair distribution of Covid-19 vaccines and research to prevent future pandemics.
“Despite numerous efforts aimed at constructive dialogue between nations, the deafening noise of war and conflict is intensifying. While diseases of pandemic proportions are spreading, the effects of climate change and environmental degradation are worsening, the tragedy of hunger and thirst is increasing,” he said in the message.

8,US ready to infuse liquidity into Afghan economy,"State Department spokesperson urges countries, particularly regional countries, to come forward and help Afghanistan.","WASHINGTON: The United States is working with various UN agencies to find ways for infusing liquidity into the Afghan economy, the US State Department said.
The announcement, made at a news briefing in Washington, followed another statement by a State Department official in Islamabad on Monday, saying that the United States would show greater flexibility on financial sanctions imposed on Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover.
Earlier this week, thirty-nine lawmakers sent a letter to US secretaries of state and treasury, asking them to help rebuild Afghanistan’s failing economy and to unfreeze the country’s assets. The United Nations has also backed this call.
“We are working with various UN bodies, including the UNDP, to find creative ways that we can infuse not only humanitarian aid but also liquidity into the Afghan economy,” State Department Spokesperson Ned Price said at the briefing in Washington.
The United States, he said, also supported the release of $280 million to Afghanistan last week from a World Bank fund. Mr Price pointed out that since August, the United States has sent $208 million of humanitarian aid to Afghanistan, which adds up to $475 million this year.
The US official acknowledged that Afghanistan needed more than just humanitarian assistance and that’s why the US Treasury had relaxed some of the sanctions imposed after Aug 15, when the Taliban seized Kabul.
These first signs of flexibility in the US stance on Afghanistan followed multiple calls for Washington to review its punishing sanctions on Afghanistan’s Taliban regime. While the sanctions were already in place, the United States also froze about $9.5bn in assets and loans after the Taliban takeover.
The move dealt a devastating blow to Afghanistan’s fragile economy that’s heavily reliant on donor assistance. This also aggravated the country’s humanitarian crisis caused by drought and more than four decades of civil war.
At the State Department briefing, Spokesman Price said that Afghanistan’s economic crisis was not “entirely unique” to the present. “This is something that was pre-existing before the withdrawal of American military forces, but it’s also something that has become more acute,” he said.
Noting that factors like the ongoing drought and dependence on foreign aid were not new, he said: “We absolutely believe there is an urgent humanitarian situation in Afghanistan now. As we are now in the winter months, our concern for the wellbeing of the Afghan people is further pronounced.”
Mr Price pointed out that US Special Representative for Afghanistan Tom West recently attended an OIC meeting in Islamabad, where a trust fund was set up for sending money to the people of Afghanistan.
Mr Price said that while the US will continue to be the world’s humanitarian leader for the Afghan people, “this’s not something we can do alone.”
He urged other countries to come forward and help Afghanistan, “including countries very nearby, regional countries – that can and should do more for the Afghan people.”
Asked which nearby countries the US would like to do more for Afghanistan, Mr. Price said: “I don’t think it is helpful for the cause of the humanitarian plight of the Afghan people for me specifically to call out countries by name.”
But there were “some perhaps fairly obvious countries in the region that have the ability and the stake in seeing an Afghanistan that is stable and secure,” he added.

9,Perfectly preserved dinosaur embryo was preparing to hatch like a bird,"“It is one of the best dinosaur embryos ever found in history,” says University of Birmingham researcher Fion Waisum Ma.","WASHINGTON: Scientists on Tuesday announced the discovery of an exquisitely preserved dinosaur embryo from at least 66 million years ago that was preparing to hatch from its egg just like a chicken.
The fossil was discovered in Ganzhou, southern China and belonged to a toothless theropod dinosaur, or oviraptorosaur, which the researchers dubbed  “Baby Yingliang.”  “It is one of the best dinosaur embryos ever found in history,” University of Birmingham researcher Fion Waisum Ma, who co-authored a paper in the journal iScience, said.
Ma and colleagues found Baby Yingliang’s head lay below its body, with the feet on either side and back curled — a posture that was previously unseen in dinosaurs, but similar to modern birds.
In birds, the behavior is controlled by the central nervous system and called  “tucking.” Chicks preparing to hatch tuck their head under their right wing in order to stabilize the head while they crack the shell with their beak.
Embryos that fail to tuck have a higher chance of death from an unsuccessful hatching.
“This indicates that such behavior in modern birds first evolved and originated among their dinosaur ancestors,” said Ma.

10,Saudi-led strikes halt aid flights into Houthi-held Yemen capital,Norwegian Refugee Council urges both sides to work with the UN to reopen Sanaa airport for humanitarian and commercial flights.,"SANAA: UN aid flights into Yemen’s rebel-held capital Sanaa have been halted by air strikes carried out by the Saudi-led coalition which supports the government, an airport official said on Tuesday.
Due to coalition air strikes targeting the Houthi rebels,  “the airport is no longer able to receive aircraft operated by the United Nations or international humanitarian organisations”, the official said.
Flights into Sanaa airport have been largely halted by a Saudi-led blockade since August 2016, but there have been exemptions for aid flights that are a key lifeline for the population.
The airport official, who asked not to be identified, called on the United Nations to secure a halt to the raids so that the airport could resume operations.
On Monday evening, the coalition said it had carried out  “a limited number of precision strikes on legitimate military targets in Sanaa international airport”.
“The operation was mounted in response to the threat and use of airport infrastructure to carry out cross-border attacks,” it said in a statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency.
Its aircraft hit six targets in the airport, including sites used to  “control attacks by drones loaded with explosives” or to  “train terrorist elements” for such operations, the statement said.
The coalition has insisted that its strikes were  “in accordance with international humanitarian law” and should have no impact on the airport’s operational capacity.
Khaled al-Shayef, Sanaa airport’s director general, said that the  “health quarantine quarters and warehouses to store export and import goods were destroyed”.
A metal hangar and cement structures near an air traffic control tower were also destroyed, a correspondent reported.
“A UN team is on the ground at Sanaa airport to verify the extent of any damage,” a World Food Programme spokesperson said.
The Norwegian Refugee Council urged both sides to work with the UN to reopen the airport for humanitarian and commercial flights.
“Aid delivery to the airport is now at a standstill. We urge both the authorities in Sanaa and the Saudi-led coalition to keep Sanaa airport out of the crossfire and to ensure that it can function again for medical and commercial flights,” NRC country director Erin Hutchinson said in a statement.
The coalition said that Saudi airports were prepared to receive Yemen-bound humanitarian flights and to deliver aid through  “access points” under UN supervision, according to statement carried by state-owned Al-Ekhbariya television.
It claimed the Houthis had halted UN aid flights into Sanaa airport on Dec 19.
The rebels have repeatedly launched missile and drone strikes against neighbouring Saudi Arabia, targeting the kingdom’s airports and oil infrastructure. They have intensified their strikes on the kingdom in recent months.

11,Europe considers fresh curbs as Omicron threatens to spoil Xmas,"LONDON: Countries across Europe were considering new curbs on movement on Tuesday, with German scientists urging...","LONDON: Countries across Europe were considering new curbs on movement on Tuesday, with German scientists urging maximum and immediate restrictions on social contacts as the Omicron variant swept the world days before the second Christmas of the pandemic.
Omicron infections are multiplying across Europe, the United States and Asia, including in Japan, where a single cluster at a military base has grown to at least 180 cases.
Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and South Korea are among countries to have reimposed partial or full lockdowns or other social distancing measures, in recent days.
New Zealand Covid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said his country, which imposed some of the world’s toughest Covid-19 measures, was delaying the start of a staggered reopening of its border until the end of February.
“All of the evidence so far points to Omicron being the most transmissible Covid-19 variant yet,” he said.
Germany’s Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases on Tuesday recommended that  “maximum contact restrictions” be imposed at once.
Federal and state leaders were due to meet later in the day to decide on new measures, which were likely to include contact restrictions even for the vaccinated and those who have recovered from an infection, but a nationwide lockdown seemed to be off the cards.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday he was looking at all kinds of measures to keep Omicron under control.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak announced 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) of extra support for businesses hit hardest by Omicron, which is hammering the hospitality sector and other businesses.
He said he was confident the measures would help hundreds of thousands of businesses. But he added that he would  “respond proportionately and appropriately” if the government were to impose further restrictions to slow Omicron, which would further hit the economy.
Sweden will urge all employees to work from home if possible and impose tighter rules for social distancing. In neighbouring Denmark, Omicron is now the predominant variant, Health Minister Magnus Heunicke said.
Many countries in the West are pinning their hopes on third, booster vaccine shots to keep the new variant at bay amid reports that two shots may not be enough.
The European Union’s drug regulator is prepared for the possibility that vaccines may have to be tweaked to fight Omicron, although there is no evidence yet, the agency’s chief said.
“There is no answer whether we will need to adapt vaccines,” European Medicines Agency executive director Emer Cook said. Omicron has hit financial markets hard in recent days, raising investor fears for the global economic recovery as the pandemic cuts travel and seizes up supply chains.
But world shares gained on Tuesday, with the dollar softening as appetite for riskier assets made a cautious return. The broader Euro STOXX 600 rose 1.2pc. Germany’s DAX’s added 1.13%, with London’s FTSE climbing 1.02pc.
In Australia, where Omicron cases have surged but hospitalisations remain relatively low, Prime Minister Scott Morrison urged state and territory leaders to avoid further lockdowns.
“We’re not going back to lockdowns. We’re going forward to live with this virus with common sense and responsibility,” he said.
In the United States, the Biden administration said it would open federal Covid-19 testing sites in New York this week and buy 500 million at-home rapid tests that Americans can order online for free.
Omicron now accounts for 73pc of all new cases in the United States, up from less than 1pc at the beginning of the month.
“We will also note that if you are unvaccinated, you are at high risk of getting sick,” a senior administration official said.  “This variant is highly transmissible and the unvaccinated are eight times more likely to be hospitalized and 14 times more likely to die from Covid.”  The Omicron variant was first detected last month in southern Africa and Hong Kong and so far has been reported in at least 89 countries.
