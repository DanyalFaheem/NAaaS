0,Supreme Court dismisses plea against Ishaq Dar over non-prosecution,Order vacates stay against former finance minister’s Senate election notification.,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed a plea moved against PML-N senator-elect Muhammad Ishaq Dar for non-prosecution, thus vacating its May 9, 2018 stay against the issuance of any notification in favour of the former finance minister by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).  
A three-judge SC bench, headed by Chief Justice Gulzar Ahmed, rejected the petition as petitioner Muhammad Nawazish Ali Pirzada did not appear to plead his case for the second consecutive hearing.  
The petitioner had challenged an earlier verdict of the Lahore High Court allowing Mr Dar to contest the March 12, 2018 Senate elections. He also accused the former finance minister of being an absconder from judiciary on the grounds that an accountability court had on Dec 11, 2017 declared the latter an absconder in a corruption reference after he failed to join the trial against him.  
Soon after Tuesday’s hearing, former attorney general Salman Aslam Butt, who was representing Ishaq Dar, explained to Dawn that since the stay granted by the Supreme Court had been vacated now, it would mean that today, December 21, was the first day to be considered his client as the notified person.  

Order vacates stay against former finance minister’s Senate election notification

Substantiating further, the counsel said it was the apex court which had prevented Mr Dar from taking the oath as a senator after it suspended the issuance of the notification. And since the suspension was an act of the court, it would mean that none of the rights of any party would be prejudiced and, therefore, the requirement of the Election (Third Amendment) Ordinance 2021 to take the oath by the lawmaker within two months after the first sitting of a legislature would be counted from December 21, Salman Butt added.  
Under the ordinance, Section 72 of the law was amended by adding proviso 72A that states that the seat of a returned candidate will become vacant if he wilfully does not make an oath within 60 days from the date of the first sitting of the National Assembly, Senate, provincial assembly or local government or within 40 days of the promulgation of the present ordinance.  
Asked whether his client would now have to return to the country to be administered the oath as a senator, the counsel said Ishaq Dar was not well but could come. Citing Article 255(2), read with Article 65 of the Constitution, Mr Butt suggested that the ECP could nominate any authority like the Pakistani high commissioner in the United Kingdom or any other similar office for the administration of oath.  
Article 255 suggests that where under the Constitution, an oath is required to be made before a specified person but for any reason, it is impracticable for the oath to be made before that person, it may be made before such other person as may be nominated.  
Likewise, Article 65 deals with the oath of members and states that a person elected to a House will not sit or vote until he has made before the House oath in the form set out in the Third Schedule.  
Salman Butt suggested that as an alternative a virtual oath could be administered as has been the practice in many countries like New Zealand, Canada and Australia, where the proceedings of respective parliaments were conducted virtually.  
Even in Pakistan, he explained, the Supreme Court as well as the Islamabad High Court had been conducting hearings through video link, which could also be adopted in the present case for the administration of oath.  
On the other hand, Additional Attorney General Chaudhry Aamir Rehman explained that since the stay against the issuance of a notification by the ECP was no more in the field, the recently promulgated ordinance, which required a lawmaker to take the oath within 60 days, would automatically apply.  
“Now either the member has to return to Pakistan to take oath or leave his seat,” he said, adding that the PML-N had also taken a plea before the high court on a challenge to the ordinance that Ishaq Dar could not return to the country since his notification by the ECP had been suspended by the Supreme Court.  
The IHC had rejected the PML-N’s plea against the presidential ordinance that requires the lawmakers to take the oath within 60 days after the first sitting of a legislature.  
Earlier, the Supreme Court had tasked different government departments with finding a way out of extraditing Ishaq Dar for his subsequent production before it with a directive for secretaries of the Foreign Office and interior as well as prosecutor general of the National Accountability Bureau to apprise the apex court of the ways on how to bring back the former finance minister.  
The apex court had also warned of proceeding ex parte against the former minister if he failed to make appearance before it, adding that the consequences of which would have to be faced by Ishaq Dar.

During a meeting with the SSGC managing director and other officials on Tuesday, Mr Dummar discussed the situation of gas supply to Ziarat and other towns and cities of Balochistan, including Quetta. “People have no option but to cut down and burn juniper trees to keep their homes warm amid freezing temperatures,” he said. 
“Gas pressure is too low while there’s no gas on the outskirts of many cities,” he said, adding that the people of Ziarat couldn’t leave their homes due to extreme cold weather. 

Asks SSGC to immediately restore supply to stop cutting of trees for fuel

He stressed that gas supply to Ziarat, Sanjawi and other areas should be immediately restored to protect the second largest juniper forest in the world. 
He lamented that all business activities were suspended and tourists who used to go to Ziarat during the snowfall were now reluctant to visit the area due to gas shortage.  
The SSGC managing director assured Mr Dummar that the problem of gas pressure in Ziarat would be resolved by taking all possible steps and uninterrupted supply would be ensured.

7,Mini-budget likely to be tabled in winter session,Shaukat Tarin expected to take oath as senator today.,"ISLAMABAD: Both the houses of parliament are set to begin their winter sessions from Wednesday (today) as the government plans to present a “mini-budget” involving fiscal adjustments and expenditure cuts worth about Rs600 billion as part of an understanding with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and opposition parties vow to resist the move with full force. 
The Ministry of Finance has already reportedly prepared the draft of the Finance (Supplementary) Bill 2021, but it is not part of the agenda of the National Assembly on the opening day as it is expected to be presented by Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance Shaukat Tarin after becoming full-fledged federal minister for finance following his election as senator on Monday on a seat vacated by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Senator Ayub Afridi from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. 
To compensate Mr Afridi over his sacrifice, Prime Minister Imran Khan has appointed him as his adviser on overseas Pakistanis which would allow him to participate in the Senate proceedings.  
Mr Tarin is expected to take oath as senator on the opening day of the Senate session on Wednesday (today). 

Proceedings of both houses of parliament begin today

The National Assembly Secretariat on Tuesday issued a 33-point agenda for Wednesday’s sitting which includes resolutions seeking extension of another 120 days in the life of six already promulgated ordinances, including the Elections (Third Amendment) Ordinance 2021, besides laying of the National Rahmatul-Lil-Aalameen Authority Ordinance, 2021 by federal Minister for Education and Professional Training Shafqat Mahmood. 
The government’s move to present the mini-budget is being described as the “prior action” that will pave the way for submission of Pakistan’s request to the IMF board for approval in the middle of January. 
The board’s approval will ensure release of $1bn for the country. It has been reported that as part of the adjustments finalised, the government has decided to reduce spending under the Public Sector Development Programme by Rs200bn, with Rs50bn coming from a decrease in general government expenditure. 
On the other hand, the government plans to earn another Rs350bn through withdrawal of certain tax exemptions. 
Talking to reporters recently in Karachi, Shaukat Tarin had said that the government would not increase taxes in the supplementary budget it planned to introduce in the National Assembly, but certain exemptions would be withdrawn. 
The opposition leaders belonging to two major parties — the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) — have already announced that they would not let the government pass the mini-budget. 
Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif had in a statement earlier this month declared that passing the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government’s ‘mini-budget’ in parliament would be like “committing national suicide”. 
Mr Sharif had said that a collective strategy would be devised by the joint opposition through a consensus to block and reject the mini-budget because it jeopardised the economic sovereignty of the country. 
The opposition leader had said that all efforts would be made to “shake the conscience” of parliamentarians representing the government and its allies to save the country and its people from the “devastating effects” of mini-budget. 
“The incumbent government has become a threat to national security. Trying to fix the crisis-hit economy with a mini-budget will be like treating cancer with aspirin. The government must resign, instead of further destroying the economy with such a disastrous mini-budget prepared by the IMF,” he had said. 
According to sources, the opposition parties are planning to lodge a protest in parliament over the recent decision of the government to increase power tariff and shortage of gas for domestic consumers, particularly in Sindh. 
Interestingly, a calling attention notice, which has been submitted by PTI MNA from Karachi Faheem Khan on the issue of “low gas pressure and non-provision of gas” to the residents of the city, is already on the agenda issued by the National Assembly Secretariat for the Wednesday’s sitting. 
Besides this, a calling attention notice of PML-N members on the “unprecedented increase in the circular debt during the tenure of the incumbent government” is also part of the NA agenda. The calling attention notice would be moved by Murtaza Javed Abbasi, Ali Gohar Khan, Marriyum Aurangzeb, Chaudhry Faqir Ahmed and Romina Khurshid Alam of the PML-N. 
The agenda shows that the government plans to seek extension of another 120 days in the life of the Federal Government Properties Management Authority Ordi­nance 2021, Elections (Third Amend­ment) Ordinance 2021, Public Properties (Removal of Encroachment) Ordinance 2021, Regulation of Generation, Transmission and Distribution of Electric Power (Amendment) Ordinance 2021, Public Private Partnership Authority (Amendment) Ordinance 2021 and Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (Amendment) Ordinance 2021.

8,Cable damage slows internet speed across Pakistan,"PTCL, PTA say alternative arrangements made to meet peak hours requirement","ISLAMABAD: Internet speed will suffer a decline of up to 25 per cent during its peak usage hours due to disruptions in one of the six cable systems providing internet and broadband services to the country, sources in the industry said on Tuesday.
The sources said that one small internet cable system was severely damaged probably by some vessel activity, with the result that internet supply to the country dropped by over 10 per cent.
Pakistan Telecommunications Company Limited (PTCL), which operates the cable, said one international submarine cable system, named AAE-1, was cut and the company arranged alternative channels for bandwidth to meet the requirement of internet usage in the country.
“More capacity will be added within a couple of days,” a PTCL spokesman said, adding that customers might face slight service degradation across the country till the addition of more bandwidth. 
While PTCL claimed the impact on the service for the customer was not serious, internet service providers received complaints about slow downloading and connectivity problems.

PTCL, PTA say alternative arrangements made to meet peak hours requirement

“Peak hours in the internet business are from 6pm to 11pm, and complaints have started after 7pm today,” Nayatel CEO Wahaj Siraj said.
There are currently six international submarine cable systems connecting Pakistan, including SMW3, SMW4, SMW5, IMEWE, AAE-1 and TW1. PTCL has the landing rights for SMW3, SMW4, AAE-1 and IMEWE cable systems. AAE-1 lands at Clifton beach close to Captain Farhan Ali Shaheed Park, while SMW3, SMW4 and IMEWE land at Hawksbay beach.
The other two submarine cable systems are operated by Transworld Associates Private Limited and its TW1 and SMW5 land at Hawksbay beach and terminate at Transworld’s cable landing station in Karachi. 
According to the sources, around five terabytes (or around 5,000 gigabytes) per second internet lands in the country and AAE-1 was a small cable with a maximum capacity of around 600 gigabytes. 
The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) regulates the submarine internet cable business like other IT and telecom functions.
In a statement issued on Tuesday, the PTA acknowledged that a fault in one of the international submarine cables had been reported in the sea near Karachi affecting some internet traffic during peak hours. “However, alternative arrangements to provide uninterrupted internet services to the users have been made by relevant service providers by obtaining additional bandwidth and capacity to meet the requirements,” the PTA said. 
The regulator also said it had directed the operators to ensure uninterrupted internet services through alternative arrangements.

9,Petition seeking PM Imran’s disqualification dismissed,The rival candidate who had filed the appeal later joined the PTI and was appointed deputy attorney general.,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has dismissed an appeal seeking the disqualification of Prime Minister Imran Khan for concealing the parentage of his putative daughter Tyrian White.  
A two-member bench of the IHC comprising Chief Justice Athar Minallah and Justice Arbab Mohammad Tahir resumed hearing the case on Tuesday after a gap of three years and four months.
After a brief hearing, the bench allowed the application seeking withdrawal of the appeal and subsequently declared that the appeal was dismissed as withdrawn.  
The appeal was filed by an unsuccessful candidate of the Justice and Democratic Party, headed by former chief justice of Pakistan Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry.   
Abdul Wahab Baloch — a rival candidate of Prime Minister Imran Khan from Islamabad’s NA-53 constituency — had raised objections to the nomination of the latter for concealing his putative daughter, Tyrian, in the papers filed for contesting the 2018 general elections from the same constituency.  
However, Mr Baloch later joined the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf in December 2018 and was appointed the deputy attorney general. 
He subsequently filed an application for withdrawing the petition, which could not be fixed before the IHC for over three years.  
He had filed the appeal in the IHC before the Election Commission of Pakistan declared Mr Khan as the returned candidate from NA-53. However, its fate has been hanging in the balance for multiple reasons. Before moving the high court, Mr Baloch filed pleas before the returning officer concerned and an election tribunal, both of which dismissed the objections.  
The appeal was last fixed before a division bench of the high court comprising Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui and Justice Athar Minallah on Aug 16, 2018. However, the bench stood dissolved as Justice Minallah recused himself from the hearing citing personal reasons.  
Subsequently, the matter was referred to the then IHC chief justice Muhammad Anwar Khan Kasi for reconstituting the bench. However, it never happened.

“Doctors are being deprived of their basic rights despite their protest,” he said, adding that people had been facing difficulties in hospitals for the last 28 days, but unfortunately the Balochistan chief minister was in Karachi and the provincial government was not taking the doctors’ problems seriously. 
He said the government had arrested some doctors and kept them in jail with criminals. He said that all demands of the doctors were legitimate and constitutional.

The Power Division’s charge has been assigned to Syed Asif Hyder Shah.  
The recent reshuffle in the energy sector is part of the alleged favouritism in the Petroleum Division due to which previous petroleum secretary Dr Arshad Mehmood was removed and has not been assigned any further posting.  
The energy ministry has reportedly been criticised for referring to only one business group as the panacea for all energy challenges, including those relating to LPG production, virtual pipelines for LNG supplies and facilitation to additional business-to-business arrangements within the existing LNG terminals.  
The Establishment Division also notified additional charge of the National Herit­age and Culture Division to Naheed S. Durrani.
