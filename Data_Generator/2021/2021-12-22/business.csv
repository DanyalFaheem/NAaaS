0,Membership for one senator each in CPEC JWGs sought,Senate panel briefed on details of projects costing less than Rs2bn.,"ISLAMABAD: A Senate panel on Tuesday sought membership for one senator each in China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) Joint Working Groups (JWGs) and decided to review development projects of all ministries to phase out non-productive and slow-moving projects.
The meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Planning and Development was presided over by Saleem Mandviwala of the Pakistan Peoples Party.
While taking up the progress report on its recommendations of September 16, the panel wanted an update on its demand to the CPEC Authority for making one member of the Senate standing committee on planning a part of CPEC joint working groups (JWGs) for future projects.
The committee was informed by an additional secretary of the planning division that the JWGs were headed by secretaries of respective ministries and divisions who also decide about the matters related to composition of the groups. The recommendations of the Senate committee had been forwarded to heads of all CPEC JWGs on October 22 and had not heard back anything.

Senate panel briefed on details of projects costing less than Rs2bn

The meeting also had a briefing on details of projects costing less than Rs2bn. The committee’s members expressed concerns over time and cost overruns of development projects. Officials told the committee that cost and time overruns occur mainly because of “too many demands competing for too scarce resources”. The financial capacity of the federal government was insufficient to fund so many projects as the list keeps growing.
The committee unanimously decided to hold meetings with the representatives of each division and the ministry on time and cost overrun projects and obtain a concrete report on the delay in the projects. The planning ministry suggested that a first-in-first-out (FiFo) method should be adopted to thoroughly study the details of the ageing projects since 2011 – 10 years.
The meeting decided to commence such reviews from the National Highway Authority (NHA) projects in presence of the representations from the NHA, the Planning Commission and the Ministry of Communications.
The committee also questioned why a large number of projects had been shown on the portfolio of the Finance Division, including those involving foreign-funded schemes. The committee was informed that lack of cancellation policy was also one of the reasons the projects were not completed. “No project is ever cancelled” an official said. The Senate committee decided to come up with its recommendations to introduce the policy of cancellation through the FiFo method to reduce PSDP burden.
With regards to the committee recommendations on the Special Ecomonic Zone Act, 2012, which should be amended in order to facilitate the investors, the committee was informed that the process has been initiated to make necessary amendments in the Act.
The committee was informed that oversight committee led by MNA Khalid Magsi had been constituted to review the progress on federally-funded PSDP projects and highlight necessary interventions and also to provide input for future development interventions to uplift Baluchistan through federal PSDP and innovative financing modes like Public-Private Partnership.
The planning division while briefing the committee on PSDP projects worth Rs2bn and less reported that total number of PSDP projects in fiscal year 2021-22 stood at 1,155 with a total cost of Rs9.422 trillion. As of July 1, 2021, an expenditure of about Rs2.886tr had been made with a throw-forward of Rs6.537tr. The PSDP 2021-22 envisaged an allocation of Rs900 billion, including Rs100bn of foreign aid.
The committee was also told that utilisation of PSDP funds as on Dec 10, 2021 stood at Rs190bn which was almost 67pc of sanctioned funds for that period.
During a briefing on the current status of development of Islamabad jail, the committee raised questions about the prison’s construction without permission and cost escalation by almost 300 per cent. “A jail is being constructed in Islamabad’s buffer zone,” said Saleem Mandviwalla and noted that the construction cost has also increased by three times. The planning commission confirmed that Islamabad Jail was earlier to be built at a cost of Rs3.9bn but its revised cost had been estimated at Rs12bn.

1,Revised strategic trade policy framework projects $57bn exports by FY25,Policy focuses on new strategic sectors to achieve goals.,"ISLAMABAD: The Federal Cabinet on Tuesday approved the revised Strategic Trade Policy Framework (STPF) 2020-25 with a string of policy measures to promote annual export target to $57 billion by end of 2024-25.
This is the fourth strategic framework announced since 2009 by the government which allocated Rs44.72bn for its implementation in the next five years by giving subsidies and other support to non-textile sectors.
As per the approved policy, an allocation of Rs13bn was made for improving competitiveness of the products in the next five years, followed by Rs15.22bn for integration into global value chain including Rs0.19bn for enhanced market access, Rs12bn for export diversification and Rs2.79bn for branding.
Under the policy, Rs16.5bn is allocated for developing export ecosystem. 

Policy focuses on new strategic sectors to achieve goals

This will include infrastructure development, institutional strengthening, standards compliance, social and environmental safeguards.
Pakistan’s exports have remained stagnant for the last 10 years ranging between $20bn to $25bn and thereby reducing the country’s share in the global export market by 10.5pc. During the same period, China and India enhanced their share in global exports by 27pc and 18pc respectively, whereas Bangladesh registered an impressive growth of 95pc.
However, the surging imports have resulted into a huge trade deficit during the period under review.
The Ministry of Commerce estimates that the measures announced in the STPF 2020-25 will help to achieve export target of $31.20bn in 2021-22, $37.38bn in 2022-23, $45.81bn in 2023-24 and $57.03bn in 2024-24, respectively.
Under the new policy, sector-wise targets for the next five years were also projected. The value-added textile was projected to achieve an export target of $15.474bn in 2021-22, which will reach $30.94bn by 2024-25. The export target of textile is projected at $4.526bn for 2021-22 which will reach $9.05bn by end 2024-25.
The leather export target for 2021-22 was projected at $910m, followed by $540m for surgical instruments, $2.037bn for rice, $300m for rice and $160m for cutlery. The projection for two sectors show massive growth which show that rice exports will reach $3.098bn and leather $1.384bn, respectively, by 2024-25.
The policy also focuses on new strategic sectors. The exports of engineering goods is projected to reach $265m by 2024-25 from $174m in 2021-22, followed by pharmaceutical products $608m from $400m, auto parts $106m from $70m, processed food and beverages $1.536bn from $1.01bn, chemicals $391m from $257m, gems and jewellery $61m from $40m, footwear $230m from $151m and meat and poultry $662m from $435m, fruits and vegetables $1.369bn from $900m, sea food $672m from $442m, marble and granite $41m from $27m, respectively.
For the implementation of the STPF, it has been decided to constitute a cross functional National Export Development Board (NEDB) comprising of members from all stakeholders. The Ministry of Commerce will serve as a secretariat of the NEDB and at least bimonthly meetings of the Board will be held in order to ensure the implementation of various policy measures.
The board will provide strategic guidance to all the relevant institutions and stakeholders mandated with the role to promote export-oriented foreign and local investment in the country with the aim to increase Pakistan’s export competitiveness by continuously improving the enabling environment for exports and increasing firms’ capabilities.

2,SBP governor reassures businessmen of facilitation in priority sectors,Says Aasan Finance scheme will be game changer in enhancing SMEs’ access to finance.,"LAHORE: State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Governor Dr Reza Baqir on Tuesday reassured the business community of facilitation of priority sectors, including agriculture, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), housing and exports. 
He was speaking at the cheque distribution ceremony held at the Multan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI) to mark disbursement of the first set of loans by Meezan Bank under SME Asaan Finance (SAAF) scheme. 
About the various initiatives of SBP to facilitate businesses, particularly SMEs, Governor Baqir said Aasan Finance scheme would be a game changer in enhancing SMEs’ access to finance as it would address long outstanding challenge of lack of collateral faced by SMEs. 
He thanked MCCI President Khawaja Mohammad Hussain for inviting him to visit MCCI and spoke about significance of SMEs in Pakistan against what they were getting in terms of access to finance, some of the initiatives SBP had taken to promote SME finance and potential role of SAAF scheme in near future. 

Says Aasan Finance scheme will be game changer in enhancing SMEs’ access to finance

Dr Baqir highlighted that with the objective of stimulating sustainable economic growth in the country, various initiatives had been taken to facilitate the business community, including introduction of a unique collateral-free loan scheme for SMEs -- Asaan Finance scheme, SBP’s concessionary refinance schemes for different sectors, measures taken to combat the Covid-19 effects, digitisation of banking systems and convincing banks to enhance financing to business community, especially priority sectors. 
Dr Baqir also met businessmen of the region and listened to their views. During the meeting, he said that Covid-19 pandemic was an unprecedented catastrophe that affected economic life of individuals and businesses at national and international level. 
He highlighted that the proactive policy response by SBP during Covid-19 pandemic, especially refinance schemes i.e. TERF and Rozgar, not only provided breathing space to employees of businessmen, but also laid down sound foundations for medium to long term industrialisation in the country. 
Traversing on another theme, the governor said SBP was working rigorously on the implementation of the government’s Mera Pakistan Mera Ghar (MPMG) scheme to provide affordable housing to masses. 
He said the facility would help individuals, who were constructing or buying a new house for the first time, to avail bank’s financing at subsidised and affordable mark-up rates. 
He said various measures had been taken to make the regulatory environment more conducive for the growth of housing sector. “A complaint resolution mechanism is also available through an online complaint management system for MPMG from January 2021.” 
He urged MCCI could play an active role in creating awareness among employees of its members to avail financing under MPMG. 
He also assured of the support of the central for the business community and asked them to continue playing their effective role in economic growth of the country. 
The SBP governor encouraged MCCI members, entrepreneurs and SMEs to avail maximum benefit from the SAAF scheme to set up and upgrade their business facilities. “Bridging a major gap, SAAF provides an avenue for SMEs to secure collateral-free financing from banks, thereby increasing their financial inclusion.” 
Under the scheme, SMEs can avail collateral-free financing of up to Rs10 million at the concessionary end-user rate of up to 9 per cent markup to meet their long-term capital expenditure and short-term working capital needs. 
He said the scheme would offer reasonable spread to banks to enable them to invest in their processes, systems, human resources and technology so that when the SAAF scheme concluded, banks were able to continue collateral-free financing on a sustainable basis. 
SAAF is a unique facility wherein refinance is provided by SBP while risk coverage of up to 60 per cent is provided by the government.

3,Byco to acquire Puma Energy,KARACHI: Vertically integrated oil firm Cynergyico PK Ltd is going to negotiate with the shareholders of Puma Energy...,"KARACHI: Vertically integrated oil firm Cynergyico PK Ltd is going to negotiate with the shareholders of Puma Energy Pakistan Ltd for the acquisition of a majority stake in the oil marketing firm, said a regulatory filing on Tuesday.
Formerly named Byco Petroleum Pakistan Ltd, Cynergyico operates in oil refining as well as marketing segments with as many as 440 retail outlets across Pakistan.
The privately held Puma Energy currently runs 542 sites nationwide. Cynergyico will own 982 retail outlets should its attempt to acquire Puma Energy succeed. The move will make Cynergyico a major player in the retail segment as the largest oil marketing company, Pakistan State Oil, operates about 3,500 outlets with more than 46 per cent market share.
“We’ll be targeting management control,” Cynergyico’s chairman Mohammad Wasi Khan told Dawn while refusing to state the exact shareholding his company is trying to acquire in Puma Energy.
He didn’t state the expected size of the transaction, noting that the final price will be subject to “negotiation and due diligence”.
“As a growing organisation, we keep on looking for good opportunities,” he said, adding that the expected impact of the acquisition on his company’s volumetric sales is still “under assessment”.
Cynergyico derived more than 66pc of its Rs34.45 billion revenue from its petroleum marketing business in the most recent quarter. The company made a net loss of Rs673.5 million in July-September.
Singapore-based Puma Energy, an integrated midstream and downstream oil company operating in 47 countries, currently controls 51pc shares in the local subsidiary. In addition to retail outlets, it runs 13 convenience stores and also operates in the lubricants segment, according to its parent company’s latest annual report.
The energy conglomerate is divesting its assets globally in order to “simplify operations and contribute to the deleveraging of the group”. It’s in this context that the parent company declared Puma Energy as an asset “held for sale” at the end of 2020.
The share price of Cynergyico rose 5.83pc to Rs6.53 apiece on Tuesday.

4,Fertiliser shortage may make wheat target a distant dream,Farmers and private experts are fearing that the shortage of compost may damage the per acre yield of wheat.,"LAHORE: The unavailability of fertiliser at the time of wheat sowing has created concerns about the crop’s per acre yield as the federal government has upped the target from 27.3 million tonnes of last year to 30mt for this season. 
The federal authorities could not ensure the availability of both diammonium phosphate (DAP) and urea fertilisers though the Punjab Agriculture Department flagged the issue well in time, in the month of September, says an official. 
At least one bag per acre of DAP is applied while preparing the land for sowing wheat, while three bags of urea are applied during the growth period of the crop. 
“The rate of DAP, 60 per cent of which is imported, as well as of urea fertiliser began increasing in the international markets by the mid-year and federal authorities had been requested to handle the issue in time but, perhaps, other priorities made them overlook it,” the official said. 
Around 80 per cent difference of rates of urea fertilizer, which is produced locally, in domestic and international prices has encouraged smuggling of the compost to neighbouring countries. The official rate of urea in the domestic market is Rs1,800 per bag while in the international markets it is being sold at Rs9,500 per bag – a whopping difference of Rs7,700 per bag. 
A senior agriculture official claims that the Pakistani Sona Urea brand had been smuggled to even Central Asian states for the past many years for its quality and low price. This year its smuggling increased manifold, while some local middlemen also hoarded the compost to earn some extra bucks by selling it in the black market. 
He says the country was in surplus as far as the urea compost is concerned and refers to a recent plea of the urea manufacturers seeking permission of the federal government for export of the surplus commodity. 
Farmers and private experts are fearing that the shortage of the compost may damage the per acre yield of wheat, provincial agriculture authorities are, however, downplaying the factor, saying that the fertiliser shortage may be overcome through efficient use of the available commodity. 
Director-General Agriculture (Extension) Dr Anjum Ali Buttar says they have already launched a vigorous awareness campaign to guide the farmers about the efficient use of farm inputs. He believes that even half a bag of urea could give satisfactory results provided the growers follow the guidelines being given by the department. 
He says the department has introduced a track and trace system for seed this year for use of quality wheat seed and at least 11.27 million bags of seed under the system have been supplied in the market.
