0,"Environment watchdog, CDA at loggerheads over Margalla Road’s construction",Pak-EPA fines the Capital Development Authority for starting work without an environmental impact assessment.,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) and the Capital Development Authority (CDA) are at loggerheads over the construction of Margalla Road and have challenged each other’s jurisdiction.
Pak-EPA through an environment protection order has asked the CDA to immediately stop construction work on the road. In response, the civic agency termed the order illegal, saying it was executing the project in accordance with Islamabad’s master plan which was superior to the mandate of the environment watchdog.
It is “an attempt to restrict the CDA in implementing its legislative duty under Sections 12-15 of the CDA Ordinance. Proviso of Rule 4 of Islamabad Wildlife (Protection, Preservation, Conservation and Management) Rules 1983 mandates that no action will be taken which is contradictory to the master plan and the authority of CDA.”
The CDA is constructing a portion of Margalla Road from Sangjani to D-12 and has already completed half of the work. However, on Dec 16, Pak-EPA issued a protection order, directing the CDA to stop the work as it was being carried out without an environment impact assessment (EIA).
The agency also imposed a fine of Rs1 million on the CDA for carrying out the work without getting the EIA.
Sources said the CDA on Tuesday paid the fine and stated that starting work without EIA was a compoundable matter, adding that the civic agency will implement all environment-related objections as it has already earmarked Rs100m for the environment. However, it will not pay any heed to the EPA regarding the boundary of the road and Zone-III.
They said only around one km patch of the road crossed Zone-III/Margalla Hills but that falls in the permissible area as zoning regulations of 1992 clarified that the boundary of Zone-III starts after the road.
CDA officials said Pak-EPA’s task was to protect environment and ensure implementation of a mitigation plan but not to check the boundary of any area.
On the other hand, the Pak-EPA order stated: “It is important to mention here, administrative plenty has not been paid so far.
Further, the mobilisation of the machinery and ongoing development activities have also been observed by the Pak-EPA within the area of the Margalla Hills National Park.”
It stated that the Pak-EPA director general in exercise of powers under section 16 (2) of the Environment Act 1997 hereby “serves upon you this environment protection order and directs you to close and stop all type of development activities forthwith and compliance of this order shall be submitted to this agency. Failure to comply with the instant order shall result in further legal action against you under the Pakistan Environmental Protection Act 1997.”
In response to the EPA order, the CDA on Tuesday submitted the Rs1m fine and decided to resist all other objections except those related to environment.
Sources said a letter from the CDA, which was to be sent to Pak-EPA, stated: “This is with reference to EPA letter dated 16.12.2021 whereby an illegal order has been issued to stop construction of Margalla Avenue.”
“CDA under Section-12 to 15 of the CDA Ordinance 1960 is responsible for development and implementation of the master plan. The master plan was prepared in 1960 and approved by the federal cabinet. It describes major highways/roads network of the capital city. Khayaban-i-Margalla is included in the master plan. It originates from GT Road near Nicholson Monument and runs in foothills of Margalla Hills and terminates on Murree Road near Bhara Kahu.”
The letter said earlier a road with the same alignment existed. Now within the same right of way, Khayaban-i-Margalla was being constructed in accordance with the original master plan.
“It is further pointed out that proviso of Rule 4 of Islamabad Wildlife (Protection, Preservation, Conservation and Management) Rules 1983 mandates that no action will be taken which is contradictory to the master plan and the authority of CDA.”
The sources said the under-construction road also provides access to the residential sectors of D-12, C-13, C-14, C-15 and C-16, and Margalla Hills National Park itself.
The letter said the EPA in its protection order had relied on an incorrect interpretation of the provisions of Section 12 of the Environment Protection Act.
“Contents of the letter are in contradiction to the master plan and will hinder the implementation of the plan. The above order of EPA is an attempt to restrict CDA in implementing its legislative duty under Sections 12-15 of the ordinance, the letter said, and added: “You are hereby required to withdraw the above-referred letter which is contradictory to the provisions of the CDA ordinance.”

Its soft launching was held here in Islamabad on Monday night, which was attended by a number of bureaucrats, scholars and mediapersons.
The initiative included graduate scholarships for deserving students, visiting fellowships for Pakistani faculty members and special lectures on Pakistan.
The organisers of the event said that OPP has also drawn strong support from the University of Oxford, the Pakistan High Commission in London, and the British High Commission in Islamabad.
The Programme has raised pledges of over £500,000 from Pakistani businessmen and key members of the Pakistani Diaspora in the UK, they said.
The OPP is the brainchild of Professor Adeel Malik of the University of Oxford, Dr Talha J. Pirzada, Lecturer in Aerospace Materials and Haroon Zaman, Trainee Lawyer at Travers Smith, London. They were assisted in this effort by Oxford alumni Minahil Saqib and Dr.Mohsin Javed.
The organisers of the event said that OPP’s principal aims are to increase the representation of Pakistani and British Pakistani students at the University of Oxford; act as a bridge between Oxford and Pakistan’s academic communities through the exchange of scholars and the sharing of scholarship; and raise the academic profile of Pakistan and Pakistan-related studies at the University of Oxford.
They said despite Britain being one of Pakistan’s most important diplomatic and economic partners, with around 1.5 million Pakistani diaspora, Pakistanis presence in its academic centres are non-existent.
“This initiative would serve to build academic and diplomatic weight in Oxford. The OPP aims to build a platform that acts as an umbrella body for a variety of initiatives, led by academics at the University of Oxford. This would house a range of activities that would serve to raise the profile of Pakistan across the academic spectrum in Oxford, while also increasing the number of Pakistani students at the University,” they said.

8,Ecnec takes up approval of two mega projects for Pindi today,"After green signal, tenders will be floated for Leh Expressway and Ring Road projects, says official","RAWALPINDI: The Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) will decide the fate of two mega projects of Rawalpindi on Wednesday (today).
These projects are: Leh Expressway and Flood Channel worth Rs103 billion and the Rawalpindi Ring Road Project worth Rs30 million.
After allegations of corruption in the initial phase of the ring road project in April this year, Prime Minister Imran Khan took notice and stopped the work.
However, the Punjab government restarted work on the project a few months ago after realigning the route. The previous route from Radio Pakistan Rawat to Sangjani measuring 63km was canceled. The new route stretches from Banth near Rawat to Thalian which is 38.3km.

After green signal, tenders will be floated for Leh Expressway and Ring Road projects, says official

Earlier, the project was to start on public-private partnership basis but now it will be funded by the Punjab government.
A senior official of the RDA told Dawn that PC-I worth Rs6.724 billion for acquisition of land for the ring road was approved by the Provincial Development Working Party (PDWP) on Oct 15 and at present the acquisition of land was in full swing.
Members of the Revenue Department, including the Land Directorate of the Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA), are participating in the project.
In addition, the PC-I of the road was recommended to be sent to the Planning Commission after clearing from the PDWP on October 25 which was approved by the Central Development Working Party (CDWP) on November 22. According to sources, Leh Nullah Expressway and Flood Channel project will be completed through public-private partnership.
Earlier, the PTI government wanted to start the project on its own but the project cost escalated due to the increase in the prices of construction material and land to be acquired for it so it was decided to start the project on public-private partnership basis.
In this regard, the PC-I was cleared by PDWP for the acquisition of land and sent to the Planning Commission on Oct 15 which approved it on Nov 22.
After approval of the projects, tenders would be floated in the next phase before start of practical work.

10,"Health ministry urged to draft, approve rules for Pims","Hospital advertised various posts twice, but till now no position has been filled, say doctors’ representatives","ISLAMABAD: Young Doctors Association (YDA) and Young Consultants Association (YCA) have urged the Ministry of National Health Services (NHS) to ensure drafting and approval of rules and regulations for the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) so that all departments of the hospital would function properly.
They said the hospital had advertised different posts twice but appointments could not be made as no one knows how the posts will be created and funds allocated for payment of the salaries.
In November 2020, President Dr Arif Alvi promulgated the Medical Teaching Institution (MTI) Ordinance. According to its initial draft, a board of governors (BoG) had to deal with affairs of Pims once it became MTI. The members were appointed and notified by the ministry of NHS on the recommendation of a search and nomination council. The BoG had overall superintendence and control over the functions of the hospital. It had power to appoint deans, the hospital director, medical director, nursing director and finance director.
However, staff of Pims protested against the ordinance and on June 28 this year the Senate Standing Committee on NHS rejected the MTI bill. Later, it could not sail through the upper house and lapsed on July 13. However, the government managed to pass the bill through a joint session.

Hospital advertised various posts twice, but till now no position has been filled, say doctors’ representatives

YCA Chairman Dr Asfandyar Khan while talking to Dawn said it was mentioned in the MTI Act that rules and regulations would be made and then an option would be given to the employees if they wanted to retain the status of civil servants or not.
“As per our understanding, those who will join the hospital as its employees will be promoted on separate quota or seats. Civil servants will be promoted on regular seats which will be left vacant in case of retirement of existing officers for 10 years and will be filled only by promotions,” he said.
Dr Khan said rules could not be made till date due to which all seats such as the director hospital, deans and others had been borrowed from the hospital rather than direct appointments.
YDA Chairman Dr Haider Abbasi said all the activities of hospital had been suspended.
“No one is aware how the hospital should be run. BoG has advertised posts twice but no recruitment has been made. Initially, posts were advertised in June this year but later it was revealed that the advertisement was a copy of an advertisement in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa due to which quotas of provinces were not mentioned in it. The posts were again advertised with the provincial quotas and the last date for filing of applications was October 31. However, appointments could not be made as no one is aware how salaries will be paid to the new appointees in absence of rules,” he said.
Dr Abbasi said a letter had been written to the ministry to make rules and regulations so that the hospital would become fully functional.

Directions to prepare lists of all events taking place on the day and for arrangement of adequate security have been issued.
Meetings of the District Intelligence Committee (DIC), district peace committees and inter-faith harmony committee have been called to discuss events, threats by terrorist groups besides inter-faith and intra-communal rifts.
Technical sweeping of venues will be carried out in coordination with the Special Branch and Civil Defence Department.
As per the directive, all allied departments, including Civil Defence, Rescue 1122, health, education and district administration, should be engaged for coordinated emergency response and better preventive mechanisms.
The guideline stated that walk-through gates/scanners should be installed at vulnerable venues and metal detectors should be provided at all entry points for body search of all entrants regardless of their gender, age and identity.
Multiple checkpoints/pickets have been set up and vehicles will be parked at safe distances from venues of events.
Vehicles found abandoned near any venue will be removed and properly checked.
As part of tightened security, extensive patrolling around venues will be carried out and teams will be stationed at strategic points.
Cable operators and flex manufacturers have been urged not to broadcast or prepare provocative or hate material at the behest of any individual or organisation and all departments have been told to conduct mock exercises to streamline emergency response.
Aerial firing and one wheeling have claimed precious lives in the past during Quaid-i-Azam Day celebrations, therefore, strict criminal action will be ensured in case of violations of rules.
Awareness and publicity against negligent vices through social and electronic media should be launched in advance to mitigate such trends, the directive stated, adding that previous record holders, drivers as well as mechanics may be bound in advance and motorcycles may also be seized to save human lives.
Provision of security and protection in the face of all threats is the responsibility of the police.
However, police should not be oblivious of their own security at the same time.
Law enforcement agencies are always at the top of threats by terrorist groups.
Hence, all precautionary measures including scattered deployment, alertness, security of vehicles, use of cover vantage point, use of bullet proof jackets must be ensured for target hardening.
The police have also been directed to follow SOPs regarding Covid-19 must be observed by both the police personnel as well as the participants of the events.
