0,Contentious local govt bill unites political opponents in Sindh,"Governor refuses to give his assent to fresh legislation; meets PSP, MQM delegations.","KARACHI: Despite a strong protest by opposition parties in the province and the refusal by the governor to sign the legislation passed by the provincial assembly, the Sindh Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2021 is finally going to become a law on Thursday (tomorrow) indicating further escalation in the opposition’s ongoing campaign against the provincial government of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP).
An official confirmed that Sindh Governor Imran Ismail once again while raising several objections had refused to give his assent to the recently passed bill. 
The LG bill, which has been termed a black law by almost all opposition parties, was first passed by the assembly last month. As per constitutional requirement, the bill was sent to the Sindh governor for his assent. However, he returned the legislation with some 10 objections to the assembly for reconsideration. 

Governor refuses to give his assent to fresh legislation; meets PSP, MQM delegations

On Dec 11, the ruling party had addressed some of the objections raised by the governor, including removing a clause that allowed election of mayor/chairman through secret ballot and reviving a condition that only an elected LG representative can contest the mayoral election when it got passed the LG bill again. 
However, the provincial government had refused to return the functions of health and education to municipalities that it in the words of opposition had ‘snatched’ from the local governments and passed the bill, which was sent to the governor again for his assent. 
According to Article 116 of the Constitution: “When the Governor has returned a Bill to the Provincial Assembly, it shall be reconsidered by the provincial assembly and, if it is again passed, with or without amendment, by the provincial assembly, by the votes of majority of the members of the provincial assembly present and voting, it shall be again presented to the Governor and the Governor shall give his assent within 10 days, failing which such assent shall be deemed to have been given. 
“When the Governor has assented or is deemed to have assented to a bill, it shall become law and be called an act of provincial assembly.” 
With or without the governor’s assent, “After 12 days it [LG bill] will stand implemented automatically across the province,” said a spokesperson for Governor House. 
Opposition parties’ meetings
The fresh objection from the Sindh governor, though hardly matters what it would does, is the reaction from the opposition parties who have already started to consider uniting their separate movements. 
In a fresh development even rival parties are considering joining hands on a single point agenda that demands strong LG system for Karachi and other parts of Sindh unlike the one proposed by the PPP government in the recently passed law. 
The first move came from the Pak Sarzameen Party (PSP) and the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, which agreed on a mutual political agenda and admitted a recent thaw in their relations. 
A PSP delegation led by former deputy mayor of Karachi Dr Arshad Vohra called on Governor Ismail in the presence of Leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh. The two sides discussed issues pertaining to local governments and expected a situation that could emerge after implementation of the Sindh Local Govt (Amendment) Bill 2021. 
They agreed on a joint struggle for ‘true’ democratic rights for the province and its cities and politics of tolerance instead of ethnicity and hatred. 
“The two parties have witnessed recent thaw in their relations,” said Opposition Leader Sheikh while speaking to reporters along with PSP leaders after the meeting. “We believe that every democratic party, which believes in devolution of powers and a strong LG system, will sooner or later join hands in the larger interest of the people of Sindh.” 
Dr Vohra of the PSP agreed with the PTI leader and said it was due to his party’s serious concerns over the law that it was approaching every political organisation which was in favour of a strong LG system in the province. 
“We believe in the interest of people,” he said. “We came to the Sindh governor and PTI leaders only with a thought that there should be consensual and joint voice against this black law of the PPP.” 
Both the PSP and PTI have already challenged the LG bill before the Sindh High Court through their separate petitions.
Later, a four-member delegation of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) also met the Sindh governor. 
A brief statement issued by Governor House said that the delegation, led by MQM-P convenor Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, held a detailed discussion with the governor. 
“The two sides discussed their reservations over the local government law and federal government-funded projects in Karachi,” the statement added.

3,"DHA, CBC earn Sindh High Court’s ire over dumping of waste into sea",A lawyer says a treatment plant will soon be set up.,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Tuesday came down hard on the Cantonment Board Clifton (CBC) and the Defence Housing Authority (DHA) for not filing compliance reports over release of sewage and dumping of waste into the sea.
A two-judge bench headed by Justice Aftab Ahmed Gorar granted last chance to the CBC and DHA to file comprehensive reports till Feb 10 and warned that in case of failure, an appropriate order would be passed against delinquent officers.
The lawyer for the CBC filed a statement along with some pictures and submitted that a treatment plant to be set up to treat raw sewage before its release into the sea.
The World Wide Fund for Nature and some other non-governmental organisations had petitioned the SHC in 2017 against dumping of sewage and industrial waste into the sea.

A lawyer says a treatment plant will soon be set up

The petitioners had informed the bench that the sea was being polluted by the sewage at Seaview near the chunky monkey amusement park and a fast food outlet.
In October, 2019 the bench had said that in order to ascertain the ground reality, a notice was issued to the DHA with direction to depute a senior officer to appear before it along with approved building plan of both the buildings after the CBC lawyer had stated that the building plans of the amusement park and fast food outlet had been approved and issued by the DHA.
At the outset, the bench recalled that in September last year, the SHC had directed the CBC and DHA officials to file reports. However, today neither any report was filed nor they were in attendance in compliance with the court’s order, it added.
The lawyer for CBC once again requested the bench for more time to file the report and the bench said that time was being allowed as a last chance.
On a previous hearing, the bench had also directed the sanitation branch of the CBC to file comments regarding release of raw sewage and dumping of industrial waste into the sea.

6,Sobho Gianchandani remembered during centenary celebrations,"KARACHI: To mark the centenary of political thinker, writer and scholar Sobho Gianchandani, the Anjuman Taraqqi...","KARACHI: To mark the centenary of political thinker, writer and scholar Sobho Gianchandani, the Anjuman Taraqqi Pasand Musannafeen organised a day-long conference at the Arts Council of Pakistan, Karachi on Tuesday evening.
The inaugural session of the conference was presided over by renowned historian Dr Mubarak Ali, who spoke via phone from Lahore. He said Sobho sahib’s personality should be remembered and written about. He led a simple life and remained loyal to his ideals till he breathed his last. The reason for his personality maturity (pukhtagi) was the time that he spent at Shantiniketan (West Bengal). It was a unique experiment undertaken by Rabindranath Tagore who set up an institute where art, literature, music and dance were taught; and students’ would study under the trees.
Dr Ali, narrating a tale about that era, said once Tagore asked Sobho sahib why he didn’t befriend the girls on campus and was always found busy with studies. Sobho sahib replied he could befriend girls, but the reason that he was at the institute was that he wanted his country to be free [from British rule]. This passion for freedom led him to join the Communist Party. He remained a member of the party and adhered to its ideology until his death. The columns that wrote for journals and the short stories that he penned indicated his inclination towards progressive thinking. In terms of personal relationship, the historian told the attendees of the moot, whenever he’d be visiting Sindh the late politician would come and meet him with a great deal of affection. He felt lucky when some friends in Karachi presented him (Dr Ali) with a lifetime achievement award, which was handed to him by Sobho Gianchandani.
‘A history-maker’ 
Earlier, Dr Tauseef Ahmed Khan said Sobho sahib was one of those people who took part in the freedom war against the British. He went to jail many a time and was even incarcerated at Shahi Qila. From British rule to Ayub Khan’s tenure, the authorities kept putting him behind bars.
After the presidential address, Ali Ousat Jaffery paid tribute to the late thinker in verse.
Mir Munawwar Ali Talpur said Sobho Gianchandani was a history-maker. He was born in a rural area but led the struggle for the working class people in cities. The marked feature of his personality was him being a politician and a writer. Sobho sahib was born on May 3, 1920 and died on Dec 8, 2014.  
Zehra Khan said she had never met the late political thinker and writer but had read about him. He was an optimist. He always saw light at the end of the tunnel. He belonged to a time when religious harmony was practised. The way he kept people together is something that’s missing from today’s society. 
Prof Dr Sher Mehrani said Sobho Gianchandani was a multidimensional person. The progressive aspect of his personality was the most prominent. At the same time he produced literature. Literature and politics cannot be separated. Touching upon his short stories, Dr Mehrani highlighted two of them — Subh kab ho gi and Dhai rupey ka qarza — the former was about women’s rights and the latter had an autobiographical tinge to it.
Javed Qazi said comrade Sobho had clarity of thought. The first time he went to jail was in 1942. He was the student leader of Sindh before Jam Saqi.
‘Sindh’s Socrates’
Dr Riaz Sheikh said Sobho Gianchandani was one of those politicians from the subcontinent who spent a big chunk of his life either in jail or house arrest or by going underground. There are three important facets of his life. One, when he went to Bengal [to study] — two, his ideological battles — three, the partition of India in 1947. He used to be called Sindh’s Socrates because like Socrates he didn’t write much but whatever he wrote it left a strong impact on readers. The disintegration of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s was a big turning point in his life, he added. 
Sohail Sangi narrated some personal stories one of which was about his grandchildren who once met Sobho sahib in an informal atmosphere and when the politician died the young ones expressed their surprise at the kind of environment in which they’d met such a great man.   
Mazhar Jamil spoke about the book that he wrote on Sobho sahib whose first edition came out in 2006 and the second in 2009, which goes to show that in a country where the book reading culture has dwindled, people like to read about individuals who they hold in high esteem. 
The second session of the conference was to be presided over by Dr Syed Jaffer Ahmed.

10,MQM-P women rally against LG law,‘PPP govt wants to render local bodies powerless’,"HYDERABAD: Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan Hyde­ra­bad district’s women wing held a demonstration against controversial local government law outside the local press club on Tuesday. 
Activists belonging to the district chapter and members of the party’s Sindh organising committee and coordination committee also participated in the protest.
Senator Khalida Tayyab said that Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) got this law passed from the Sindh Assembly but her party would not let it “commit a robbery on the rights of people of Sindh”. She said the rights had been usurped in the name of quota system. Government jobs were doled out on the basis of fake domiciles, she claimed.
The Senator said that local bodies’ elections were held to devolve powers at grass root level but the PPP had done vice versa by usurping LGs’ powers.

‘PPP govt wants to render local bodies powerless’

MNA Kishwar Zahra told the participants said that the protest was not against any community but against those laws that were aimed at crushing people. This [LG] law is also aimed at rendering people of Sindh powerless. Those who got votes from rural areas of Sindh never returned to their constituencies and now they wanted to push their voters into problems.
Sindh’s hospitals lack anti-rabies vaccine while “the government of waderas” have done nothing over the last 13 years. This government had paralysed local bodies, she said.
MNA Salahuddin said that Sindh government’s law had divided people by amending the law. A rural-urban divide was created on the basis of fake majority, he added.
He noted that laws in conflict with the Constitution used to be enacted since 2013. 
He said that Pakistan’s national security institutions should take notice of Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah’s recent statement [construed as a hint at Sindh’s cessation from the federation] instead of observing silence.
MPA Nadeem Siddiqui said that mayor should be empowered in local bodies law, and argued that this would empower mayor of Larkana as well, besides Karachi’s. He alleged that the CM and provincial ministers were indulging in ethnic politics while the Muttahida was fighting for people’s rights.
Hyderabad women wing in-charge Farzana Saeed said that people like [Sindh Information Minister] Saeed Ghani wanted to raise their stature by criticising the Muttahida. She said her party’s women wing was well aware of their real faces.

The hostility that had started with the alleged kidnapping of a boy two months back had already claimed five lives before the fresh armed clash. 
Reports from Gul Hassan Mangnejo village, located within the jurisdiction of the Jatoi police station, suggested that armed men from the rival sides started trading fire on Tuesday after theft of a heavy electric motor belonging to the Narejos, who put the blame on Mangnejos. 
The clash left three Narejos — Dilbar, Mumtaz and Ghulam — and two Mangnejos — Ahmed Ali and Kaleem — dead. Several other people sustained bullet wounds and two of them, Ghulamullah and Naeem, were stated to be in a critical condition at a government hospital in Pir Jo Goth. 
A strong contingent of police was present nearby but could not enter the battle filed due to heavy firing. Later, the police collected the bodies but heavily armed men from the two community snatched away their respective dead.  
A few hours later, police managed to persuade them to bring the bodies to the Pir Jo Goth hospital for a post-mortem examination. The Mangnejos then took away their dead but the Narejos said they would not collect their dead until killers were arrested. They said the Khairpur police had never been serious in maintaining law and order in the area because of which 10 people had been killed and many others wounded in attacks and clashes over the last two months.
According to available information, the two communities had been at odds over the disappearance of a boy, Ali, son of Mahboob Narejo, from Yousuf village two months ago. The affected family believed that he had been kidnapped by the Mangnejos. The matter was reported at the Faiz Mohammad Bindho police station. The dispute led to several attacks and clashes since then and left five persons dead.
Meanwhile, Khairpur SSP Zaffar Iqbal Malik told the media on Tuesday evening that officers and personnel from different police stations had condoned off the entire area to trap all those involved in the armed clash. Pickets had also been raised to bring the situation under control, he said. Several suspects have been arrested and arms, including two Kalashnikov rifles, two shot guns and three pistols, along with a sizable quantity of ammunition, seized from them, according to the police officer.
He claimed that certain members of both the communities were wanted by police in many cases of heinous crime, as well as petty crime like theft and animal robbery.
