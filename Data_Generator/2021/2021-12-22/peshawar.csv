0,JUI-F’s tally of tehsil top slots in KP reaches 17,"PTI grabs 12 of 47 chairman offices, independents seven, ANP six and PML-N three.","PESHAWAR: The opposition Jamiat-i-Ulema Islam-Fazl on Wednesday won the chairmanship of two more tehsil councils in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa taking its overall tally of the top local body seats to 17.
The Provincial Election Commission has so far declared the provisional results of the Dec 19 local body polls in 47 tehsil councils with the JUI-F’s electoral lead growing.
The ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf has clinched chairmanship of 12 tehsil councils.
In the provincial capital, JUI-F candidate Haji Zubair Ali has a lead of over 11,000 votes over the runner-up, Rizwan Bangash of the PTI. Mr Ali has secured 62,388 votes against 50, 659 votes of Mr Bangash.
However, the results for the mayor election have been withheld by the ECP after the postponement of polling in six polling stations due to law and order situation.
Observers insist that Mr Ali’s lead is so massive that even the outcome of the re-polling on the six polling stations is unlikely to change the overall results.
Out of the remaining six tehsil chairmen seats of the provincial capital, the JUI-F has clinched four seats, while the PTI and ANP have won one top tehsil council slot each.
The ruling PTI has shown poor performance in the provincial capital despite having 11 of the 14 MPAs, all five MNAs, provincial governor and several ministers from there. It won only one of the seven tehsil council chairmanship seats.
Independent candidates grabbed the third highest number of seven tehsil chairmanship seats from different areas of the province.
The opposition Awami National Party has bagged six tehsil council chairman seats, PML-N three and Jamaat-i-Islami, Pakistan Peoples Party and Tehreek-i-Islahat Pakistan one each.
Of the 63 tehsil councils, where elections were held on Sunday, the ECP has so fat released 47 names of the winning candidates. The rest of election results are either withheld due to re-polling or will be released later.
The ECP has not declared the election results for any of the four tehsil councils in Lakki Marwat district and four in Karak district. Similarly, the poll results are awaited for two tehsil councils in Khyber, one in Mohmand, one in Dera Ismail Khan and two in Bajaur.
The PEC has cancelled elections in three tehsils of Kohat, Dera Ismail Khan and Bannu districts.
ANP candidate for tehsil council slot Umar Khitab Shirani was killed a day before elections leading to election postponement. Violence was reported in Darra tehsil of Kohat district. A mob protesting the merger of Fata with KP had stopped people from casting vote. Similarly, some ECP staff were abducted along with the election material.
Similarly, the ECP announced re-election in some polling stations of Peshawar, Khyber, Mohmand and other districts, where polling were stopped on the election day due to violence.
An official in the regional ECP office in Peshawar told Dawn that the data had yet not compiled of the areas where re-elections would be held.
“We are working on the matter and will be shared in a couple of days,” he said.
In the first phase, the local body elections were held on Sunday in 17 districts of the province, while the elections for local bodies in the remaining districts will take place on Jan 16.

3,Dir woman remanded over false rape allegation,Judge accused of sexually assaulting her was cleared by JIT on December 3.,"PESHAWAR: A court in Lower Dir district on Tuesday remanded a woman in police custody for three days after the registration of an FIR against her for levelling false sexual assault allegation against a senior civil judge last month.
The woman,a resident of Rahimyar Khan, had alleged that senior civil judge of Lower Dir district Jamshed Kundi had raped her in his official residence.
The complaint led to the arrest of Mr Kundi by the police.
However, a joint investigation team had cleared him on Dec 3 of the charge after a probe. A day later, he secured bail from a local court.

Judge accused of sexually assaulting her cleared by JIT

Following the issuance of the JIT probe report, the Peshawar High Court removed suspension of Mr Kundi as a judge.
On Wednesday, the woman was produced before senior civil judge Essa Khan Afridi by the police, who sought her seven days physical custody. However, the judge remanded her in police custody for three days and directed them to interrogate her in prison in the presence of a jail officer and a woman police officer.
The Balambat police station had booked the woman on Dec 19 on the written complaint of Mr Kundi. The FIR was registered under sections 419, 420, 389, 500 of the Pakistan Penal Code for cheating by personation and fraud and accusing a person of an offence for extortion and defamation, and Section 22(2) of the Anti-Rape Act for giving false information to the police.
In his application, Mr Kundi said the woman along with her co-accused Aqeel Nadir Khan, a resident of Lahore, lodged an FIR against him accusing him of sexual assaulting her as they wanted to extort his 15 tolas of gold through blackmailing.
He added that when he refused to meet the demand, the two accused him of sexually assaulting the woman.
Mr Kundi insisted that the main accused also falsified her identity before the police while accusing him of sexual assault and used the same to testify before a judge on Nov 27.
He said the accused also damaged his reputation, which he had built over 20 decades long public service by levelling baseless rape charge.
On the basis of the JIT report, the local police approached senior civil judge Essa Khan Afridi on Dec 18 for the cancellation of the FIR the woman had got registered.
After examining the police report, Mr Afridi ordered the FIR’s cancellation.
He, however, raised questions in his order sheet raised about the way police handled the case and observed that the behaviour of the police seemed tilted towards the ‘so-called’ complainant for reasons ‘best known to them’.
“This case also puts question mark on the role of local police right from the registration of the FIR till the submission of case file for the cancellation of FIR,” he observed.
According to the order sheet, the complainant while faking her identity accused a sitting senior judge of committing fraud, extorting money and raping her. However, the local police didn’t verify her identity.
It also noted that even after the registration of FIR, the police didn’t deemed it expedient to inquire about the truthfulness of the allegation and instead, it arrested the accused, a judge, causing embarrassment not only to the district judiciary but to the entire institution.
“Had the local police taken a little pain of collecting evidence prior to the arrest of the accused judicial officer, which is the mandate of the law, the judiciary would not have faced embarrassment,” the order read.
On Nov 25, the complainant had informed the Lower Dir police about her alleged rape by the judge at his official residence. She insisted that the judge had asked for Rs1.5 million bribe three months ago to provide a job to her sister, but as she didn’t have that amount, she gave the judge her Rs1.5m jewellery.
The woman claimed that the judge contacted her on Nov 25 and said he was unable to secure the promised job, so she should accompany him to Lower Dir to collect her jewellery.
She added that she travelled to Lower Dir from Peshawar in the judge’s official vehicle and after she reached the judge’s official residence in Balambat Colony, he said he would return jewellery only if she agreed to have sex with him. On refusal, the judge sexually assaulted her, the woman alleged.

8,Management cadre doctors oppose interview for administrative posts,Ask govt to fill scheduled positions by transfer,"PESHAWAR: The management cadre doctors have opposed ongoing interviews for administrative positions, asking the health department to fill these scheduled posts on transfer basis as per rule.
The health department has started interviews to select management cadre doctors for administrative positions at the directorate-general health services (DGHS) Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, but a group of doctors working on management positions in the department say that these positions should be filled directly without interviews.
The provincial chapter of Association of Management Cadre Doctors wrote a letter to health secretary on December 17, requesting him to stop the interviews and fill the positions from the existing lot of management cadre, in line with the seniority.

Ask govt to fill scheduled positions by transfer

The letter entitled “Illegal selection process against scheduled positions of management cadre in health department” has said that the ongoing interviews to fill the administrative positions in the department is against the Health Management Cadre Rules, 2008 according to which the positions should be filled from the respective cadre through transfers.
The positions included deputy and additional director provincial health services academy and director-general drugs in BPS-20, director human resource, director (administration), director nutrition and programme manager integrated vector management control programme DGHS in BPS-19, deputy chief and four coordinators at health sector reforms unit in BPS-19 and four directors in DGHS in BPS-18.
The letter says that there is no provision of holding interviews for these posts and should be filled through transfers from amongst the management cadre doctors. These positions are identical to PMS and PAS/PCS services where the executive positions are not filled through interview but via transfers and same is position of management cadre in the health department, it adds.
Sources in health department told Dawn that the interviews started on Monday were meant to select candidates on merit and improve the performance of health department for improvement of patients’ care.
“There are instructions from the top leadership of ruling party to ensure meritocracy in the appointments. All these positions are currently filled but new people would be posted after completion of the interviews,” they said. So far, top positions in health department were filled from the, management cadre doctors and one person was selected from a panel of three persons sent to government by health department but now there would be interviews to select available doctors, they added.
The department has already been facing shortage of management cadre doctors as 36 positions of 42 sanctioned posts of BPS-20 stay vacant. The government had created the administrative cadre in 2008 to appoint trained doctors to management positions and make service delivery effective while the general cadre doctors were required to work in hospitals with patients.
However, sources said that still many administrative cadre positions were held by general cadre doctors, who did not have experience or the desired qualifications. 
They said that the ongoing interviews would further demoralise those senior doctors, who were about to retire.
Special Secretary Health Dr Syed Farooq Jamil told Dawn that the interviews were aimed at finding suitable persons for various administrative positions to improve service delivery.
“These are scheduled posts but the interviews are being conducted as part of internal head hunting to know about the capabilities of the doctors and depute them where they can give better results. It is an assessment where we talk to the doctors face-to-face and get more information about them,” he said.
Dr Farooq said that appointments to the management positions would be made from the existing lot and there would be no fresh appointment from outside.

“We will consult the leaders of other political parties as well, and challenge the election results in the election tribunal,” he said. Maulana Ali, who remained KP education minister during the MMA government, alleged that Asad Qaiser used illegal means to ‘snatch’ the seat.
Mr Ali alleged that JUI-F leaders did not get results till 1pm the next day, and even result in his own Zarobai village and Maneri also came late. The JUI-F leader said the form-17 was also not given to the party.
