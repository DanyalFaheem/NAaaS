The bench issued notices to the complainant and the former DPO for Jan 17.
On Jan 19, 2019, Muhammad Khalil, his wife Nabeela and their four children were travelling in a car with neighbour Zeeshan behind the steering wheel when the personnel of the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) intercepted the vehicle and opened fire on the passengers suspecting them terrorists.

The prosecution presented 24 private witnesses, however, all of them exonerated the suspects from the charge and majority of them said they knew nothing about the occurrence.
The government filed an appeal against the acquittal of the police personnel.
The appeal said the trial court ignored several facts of the case including video and forensic evidences.
It said the trial court neither provided protection to the eyewitnesses nor took action against them after they resiled from previous statements. The government asked the court to set aside the trial court’s verdict and punish the suspects under the law.

1,Verdict reserved on pleas against riverfront land acquisition,LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Tuesday reserved its judgement in a set of petitions challenging the land...,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Tuesday reserved its judgement in a set of petitions challenging the land acquisition for the Riverfront Urban Development Project (RUDP) and violations of environmental laws by the Ravi Urban Development Authority (Ruda), the executing body.
In the concluding hearing, Advocate General of Punjab (AGP) Ahmad Awais advanced his arguments in favour of the project. He opposed the petitions saying the project was of public importance and the court lacked jurisdiction to interfere in the policy affairs of the government.
Advocate Amina Qadir, who was appointed as amicus curiae by the court, submitted that the project in question was not of public purpose. She said the government had been unable to justify the project keeping in view the public trust doctrine as Punjab would be bereft of its fertile plains.
She further said that there was no adequate compensation mechanism defined for the people whose land had been forcibly acquired.
Previously, Ruda’s counsel Barrister Ali Zafar in his concluding arguments had argued that the project was environment friendly and would ensure conservation, clean air for Lahore and include within it a massive forest.
The farmers, land owners and developers had filed the petitions through lawyers Sheraz Zaka, Ahmad Rafay Alam, Azhar Siddique, Waqar A. Sheikh and others.
The petitioners challenged the mode and manner of the land acquisition proceedings undertaken by Ruda for the project. They said the land acquisition collector, despite a protest by the landowners, passed 18 awards on a single day amounting to multiple billion rupees.
The petitioners also challenged the legality of forceful acquisitions of land for commercial purposes under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. Some of the petitioners questioned the legality of the Environment Impact Assessment of the project prepared by a non-registered consultant.
The judge had stayed the process of land acquisition for not meeting the legal requirements and environmental laws.

He said as per police data, most of the criminals stayed in hotels and rest houses before and after committing crimes and the Hotel Eye software proved helpful for police in arresting them.
“The Punjab police department has declared mandatory use of ‘Hotel Eye’ app in all hotels, inns and private rest houses of the province”, the IGP said. He directed all regional and district police officers to ensure entry of the particulars of every citizen staying in a hotel in the ‘Hotel Eye’ app.

The resolution taken up out of turn was moved by PML-Q’s Khadija Umar. It said that the Tableeghi Jamaat is apolitical, engaged in preaching of Islam and has no connection with terrorism acts.
PML-N’s Samiullah Khan and PPP’s Hassan Murtaza objected to the use of the word ‘only’ preaching outfit, saying there are other organisations that are preaching Islam in the country and abroad.
On their insistence the word was omitted from the resolution before its unanimous adoption.
Speaker Chaudhry Parvez Elahi said people from 72 countries, including Saudi Arabia, would attend annual congregations of Tableeghi Jamaat. He said he had held meetings with ambassadors of various Muslim countries on the issue during the last two days and that Saudi envoy promised to look into it.
He claimed that the resolution had been moved on the advice of the envoys.
He said that he was disclosing this just for information of the lawmakers and his statement would not be part of the official record.
IRRIGATION: Provincial Irrigation Minister Mohsin Leghari has counseled Sindh Assembly members to sit with representatives of Punjab to discuss and settle water issues instead of adopting resolutions on the subject.
Speaking in the house, Mr Leghari said the brothers from Sindh resort to political statements instead of discussing the issue on the basis of arguments and statistics.
He said Sindh would object to any work executed by Punjab for improving the latter’s irrigation network without hurting the rights of Sindh.
He said under the 1991 Water Accord Punjab is free to use its share of water when and where it would be needed and legally Sindh had no right to object to it.
Referring to Sindh’s objection to Phase-II of the Greater Thal Canal, he said Punjab executed the project from its own resources though Islamabad was to build the Phase-II and that the water to be released in the canal would be from the share of Punjab and not from any other province.
He said Punjab had never objected to any water project of Sindh and the latter should also show the same spirit.

“Unlike the toothless local government system of Sindh, we are going to enact an empowered local bodies system in Punjab. The PTI is the only national party with representation in all provinces,” he said.
On the other hand, the PML-N has been eliminated from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh, and the PPP from Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, whereas the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam is nowhere to be found in the whole country. Such a fragmented and divided opposition is a blessing in disguise for the government, he claimed.
He said that in the absence of a comprehensive party narrative, corruption-ridden opposition leaders were hiding behind political rhetoric even outside accountability courts instead of being embarrassed.
He told reporters at a seminar on the promotion of tourism that as per directions of Chief Minister Usman Buzdar, work was being done to bring the neglected tourist attractions, especially those in south Punjab.

Justice Muzammil Akhtar Shabbir issued the direction, referring a petition filed by Raj Maqsood and other law officers to the chief secretary.
Earlier, petitioners’ counsel Shoaib Saleem argued that a policy of awarding executive allowance to various civil servants was approved by the cabinet and then notified by the Punjab governor.
He said a policy matter could only be reviewed by the high court under Article 199 of the Constitution.

The petitioners had contended that they qualified competitive exam of the Punjab Public Service Commission (BS-17&18) and had been working as assistant/deputy district attorneys in all districts of the province.
The petitioners submitted that they had been rendering services on the pattern of the law officers of the office of advocate general of Punjab. However, they said, the government granted executive allowance (1.5 times of monthly basic pay) to all officers in the same rank working in the Services and General Administration Department, but they (petitioners) had been denied the facility in a discriminatory manner.

For the first time under this programme, ITU professors will be involved in the planning, organisation and delivery of an Erasmus Mundus joint masters degree in Europe and will be sent to teach at the partner European universities, says a press release on Tuesday.
It says international students, enrolled under the CYBERUS programme, will be sent to Pakistan as well for their research work at the ITU and will be fully-funded by the programme.
ITU is the first public-sector research-intensive university in Pakistan, which has earned global recognition for excellence in just nine years since its inception.
ITU Director Research Dr Khurram Bhatti, says the programme aims to train future experts (engineers, managers, researchers) in cybersecurity from around the world over a two-year period.
Under this programme, ITU will contribute to the development of cybersecurity courses, provide exchange placement to international students in cybersecurity, be represented on the International Advisory Board of the programme, mentor students with a particular focus on female students, and contribute to the joint development of a sustainability plan beyond EU funding.
Alongside ITU, 30 international higher education institutions and research organisations, 15 companies, company clusters and 6 state agencies (government departments) are partners in this programme from around the world, making it one of the most comprehensive collaborations, the press release adds.
Pakistan’s engagement in this programme will open new avenues of international collaboration in cyber security – an area of research where the country needs to rapidly develop expertise to deal with future challenges in e-governance, e-services, and financial markets.

Eutrophication is the enrichment of water by nutrient salts that causes structural changes in the ecosystem such as increased production of algae and aquatic plants, depletion of fish species, general deterioration of water quality and other effects that reduce and preclude use.
Experts say the cage fish farming in freshwater bodies or lakes linked with the River Indus poses a threat of eutrophication of the lake as well as creates hazards for endangered marine life, including Indus dolphins.
Saline Water Aqua Culture Research Centre Deputy Director Shaheen told Dawn the government started the project of cage fishing to provide business to fish farmers. He maintained that 5,000 floating cages would be installed in freshwater bodies linked to the River Indus for the cultivation of fish imported from Thailand.
He said more than 100 floating cages were installed in a freshwater lake along the Indus River near Ghazi Ghat while 200 cages were functioning in a lake by the Punjnad Headworks.
Dr Amir Ibrahim is studying the ‘evolutionary ecology’ of the Indus Dolphin at Nánjīng University of Life Sciences in China.
He told Dawn that habitat integrity was the most important element in the long-term conservation of any endangered species.
Cage fish farming in the natural habitat of the Indus Dolphin was not a healthy practice, he added. Uneaten food and fecal material (which contains nutrients) easily settle down and spread with the help of water flow, which later change the natural composition of water and ultimately lead to eutrophication. Once it occurred, it would be almost impossible to control it, he added.
Some fries and fish escape into the natural water. When they would breed with wild fish species, it results in hybrid stock, which may become invasive and dominant species to replace the wild fish species rapidly and resulting loss of natural genetic stock of the wild fish. Any disease from the stock can easily infect the wild fish. All these consequences pose serious threats to the habitat and prey of the endangered Indus River dolphin, he added.
Fisheries Inspector Hussain Mehdi said individual fish could jump into open waters and at least two per cent of unused artificial feed could settle down in depth at the ground level of the lake.
