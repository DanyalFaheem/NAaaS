FIFA held a ‘global summit’ of leaders of national football federations to discuss its proposal to increase the frequency of the World Cup from every four years to two. 
The financial data forms part of an overall feasibility study, of which FIFA presented a summary on Monday with a full 700-page report set to be published. 
The upbeat findings are in marked contrast to analysis put forward by critics of the proposals. 
There has been opposition from European clubs, the top leagues and European governing body UEFA, whose president Aleksander Ceferin has threatened to boycott any additional tournament. 
No vote is yet scheduled for the plan, but Infantino said a majority was in place for the idea but it needed to be dealt with as part of the broader overhaul of the international match calendar. 
“If I was going to a vote tomorrow probably the majority would vote in favour of a World Cup every two years,” Infantino told a news conference after the summit. 
“But it is not the topic, we are looking at the entire calendar and how we can make football better and how many we can bring on board with a new way of organising the future in football,” he added. 
“There is a lot of opposition and there is as well a lot of voices in favour and FIFA is a global organising body, so we need to really try to combine all these different points of view.” 
Infantino would not state when any vote would be held or whether it would be on the agenda at the FIFA congress in Doha on March 31. 
“It is about getting the right decisions for football at the end of the day and we will take the time that it takes, to come to this decision. I will not commit to anything at the congress. Everything is open and flexible,” he said. 
“We continue the dialogue, the analysis, we hope we can make progress, one way or the other, or some middle way, we will see,” he said. 
FIFA officials told the delegates that $3.5 billion of the extra revenue would go to a new ‘Member Association Solidarity Fund’ with each national federation allocated around $16 million in a four-year period, while extra funds would also be given to the FIFA Forward Program for development projects. 
FIFA said that the funds would help reduce the gap in revenues between the developed and less developed football markets. 
“This is certainly a new basis for discussion,” Infantino said of the report he hopes will revive plans to overhaul national-team football that were stalled since September by resistance to its key aim. 
“We have presented today a situation where we can come out with a solution that benefits, actually, everyone without harming anyone.” 
Monday’s debate in Doha was once intended to lead to a vote on scheduling World Cups every two years for men and women. 
It was downgraded to a debate, and a launch for FIFA’s hefty feasibility study, after UEFA and South America’s CONMEBOL threatened boycotts of a biennial World Cup. The International Olympic Committee spoke out against FIFA taking time and attention away from championships in other major sports events. 
FIFA aims to drive football development and close the gap on European and South American dominance by giving more teams from other regions more chances to play at World Cups. 
Only eight countries have ever won the men’s World Cup since it was first held in 1930, and there has never been a winner from outside Europe or South America. 
These confederations will provide more than half the teams for next year’s World Cup in Qatar, which is due to be the last with 32 teams before the competition is expanded to feature 48 nations from 2026. 
“Everyone sees that the gap is getting bigger and bigger between a few who have it all and others who have nothing,” said Infantino, a former long-time UEFA official. “We cannot say to the rest of the world it’s great, football is global, give us your money and watch us on TV.” 
Arsene Wenger, FIFA’s head of Global Football Development, suggested, without naming UEFA or CONMEBOL, that FIFA’s opponents were scared of losing control of their own continental competitions. 
“We face opposition but what I regret is that 90% of this opposition is emotion and not facts and not analysis, we have to get over this fear because most of the emotions that we face are based on fear,” he said. 
The IOC is concerned about clashes in the schedule with other sports, the men’s World Cup overshadowing women’s editions of the tournament, and a further massive strain on athlete welfare. 
The Summer Olympics, like the European Championship and Copa America, are all scheduled for 2024 and 2028 setting up a direct clash if FIFA expanded beyond its 2026-2030 cycle. 
However, Infantino, also an elected member of the IOC, said FIFA’s plans are not a threat to anyone. 
“I don’t believe that I am making myself, or we are making ourselves, enemies,” said the FIFA president, who is due for re-election in less than 18 months’ time. “The prestige of a competition like the World Cup will not be undermined by it becoming more frequent.”

Levante had jumped out to an early 2-0 lead through goals from Jose Campana and Roger in the 21st and 24th minutes to give the team hope of securing their first win of the season before Valencia came roaring back.
Guedes cut the deficit in half with a goal in the 44th and Soler pulled Valencia even early in the second half when he converted a penalty five minutes after the restart. Soler’s second in the 72nd completed the fightback and Guedes put the game out of reach with his second in the 85th. Anis Bardhi pulled one back in the first minute of injury time but it was not enough as Levante slumped to their tenth defeat of the season.
Levante remains last in the standings with eight points from 18 games and seven points from safety. Valencia moved up to seventh with 28 points, just one behind Atletico Madrid and Real Sociedad in fifth and sixth, respectively.

Sunday’s virtual auction failed to attract any big bidders with the largest single offer of $2,150 for a painting of the former World Cup winner by artist Lu Sedova.
But the Buenos Aires house the former Barcelona and Napoli star gave to his parents, put up for a minimum $900,000, was one of many items that did not find a buyer.
Two BMW cars, listed at a combined $390,000 and a seaside apartment in Mar del Plata ($65,000) also remained without a bid.
The three-hour auction brought in just $26,000 with more than $1.4 million in assets unbid on, according to AFP calculations.
Auction house Adrian Mercado Group decided to extend the bid time  “due to the number of national and international bidders that did not manage to register by the deadline” on Saturday.
It said new bidders would have another 10 days to register a bid for the remaining items.
Sunday’s auction attracted bidders from several Latin American countries, Italy, France, Britain, Russia and Dubai.
The second most expensive piece of memorabilia sold on Sunday was a photograph of Maradona with late Cuban leader Fidel Castro, purchased for $1,600 by a buyer in Dubai.
Other items sold were a Napoli team jacket, training pants and a box of Cuban cigars.
The sale had been ordered by Judge Luciana Tedesco to pay the debts and expenses accrued by the estate of Maradona, who died of cardiac arrest on Nov 25, 2020.

8,South Africa focused on beating India despite off-field woes,"""We just want to focus on our cricket, playing a really tough series against India,"" says Test captain Dean Elgar.","

JOHANNESBURG: Test captain Dean Elgar says he will not let the allegations of racist conduct that have come to light at Cricket South Africa in recent months become an excuse for failure as his side prepare to host India in a three-match series from Sunday.
Director of cricket Graeme Smith, who denies the claims, and national team coach Mark Boucher were among a number of CSA employees implicated in “tentative findings” made by the Social Justice and Nation Building Ombudsman into alleged past discrimination. 
CSA confirmed on Tuesday they would investigate the conduct of everyone implicated in the report, though only once the series with India has concluded. 
“What happens off the field for me is irrelevant now,” Elgar told reporters on Tuesday. “As a playing unit we have been through such crappy times [amid the COVID-19 pandemic] that we have formulated such a good bond within our group. 
“Our culture has been tested and pushed to levels that I didn’t think it could be pushed to in my short term as captain. We’ve had so many different administrators, we don’t even know who’s there now. 
“It’s not ideal to have these headlines coming up, we just want to focus on our cricket, playing a really tough series against India.
“We must be mindful that if things are bad off the field, we can’t use that as a cop-out for us. We are a professional team and professional players.” 
Elgar appeared to give his backing to Boucher after former Test spinner Paul Adams said he had been called a “brown shit” in a South Africa team song during his time in the side, including by former wicket-keeper Boucher, who has since apologised. 
“From the players point of view, we back our coaches and management,” Elgar said. “They put in so much work that goes unnoticed, and it gets watered down by the media. I know what they do behind the scenes. It is not nice to see our coaches get lambasted for things.” 
Elgar twice described India as “the best team in the world” but said the South African team had put in three good days of preparation. 
With the majority of the likely starting team having played little or no red-ball cricket this season, Elgar said the preparation had included match simulation, “which has been pretty productive.” 
Elgar acknowledged that India had a much-improved fast bowling line-up but said he backed his own bowlers, even without Nortje who has been ruled out of the three-match series because of a hip injury, in home conditions. 
“We know that it’s going to be tough but we know that it’s going to be tough for the Indian batters to face our bowlers. I’d rather be sitting here knowing that than sitting in the Indian dressing room knowing they have to face our fast bowlers.” 
Elgar said he expected a “good cricket wicket” at Centurion which would enable batsmen to score runs if they applied themselves, while offering assistance to bowlers with pace and bounce. 
South Africa have, meanwhile, revealed they will be without fast bowler Anrich Nortje for the series after he failed to sufficiently recover from injury. They will not be calling up a replacement.

9,"Pakistan lose thriller to Korea, fail to make Asian Champions Trophy final for first time",Pakistan will play arch-rivals India in the third-place playoff before the final.,"DHAKA: Pakistan got off to the perfect start but couldn’t get the ideal finish.
In an end-to-end semi-final of the Asian Champions Trophy, Pakistan ended up on the losing side of an 11-goal thriller against South Korea at the Maulana Bhasani Hockey Stadium here on Tuesday.
South Korea’s 6-5 win set up a title clash for them against Japan, who later overpowered India 5-3, on Wednesday. Pakistan, who took a 1-0 lead in the third minute against the South Koreans, will play arch-rivals India in the third-place playoff before the final.
Pakistan and India were the joint-holders of the Asian title and Pakistan’s defeat marks the first time since the inception of the tournament that they have failed to qualify for the final.
“It is disappointing for us because we scored more field goals,” said Pakistan captain Umar Bhutta after the match, referring to his side’s four field goals while the South Koreans only got one from open play. “We played a good match but the two goals we conceded from penalty corners hurt us.”
A penetrating run from Umar gave Pakistan the early lead when he entered the circle before unleashing a fierce shot into the far corner that gave South Korea goalkeeper Kim Jaehyeon no chance.
Pakistan’s defence, however, undid the good work as South Korea took a 2-1 lead in the 12th minute after getting two penalty corners within the space of a minute. Jang Jonghyun, who got four goals, made no mistake from seven yards on both occasions.
Junaid Manzoor got Pakistan back on level terms when he turned in from close range in the 22nd minute but Jang restored South Korea’s advantage when he converted a penalty corner three minutes later.
Afraz hauled Pakistan level again five minutes later with another field goal but it was South Korea who went into half-time with a 4-3 lead after Yang Jihun converted yet another penalty corner moments later.
South Korea had a two goal advantage when they scored their only field goal through Jeong Junwoo in the 44th.
Mubashar Ali restored parity when he converted back-to-back penalty corners in the 47th and 51st only for Jang to break Pakistan hearts with the drag-flick winner four minutes from time.
Olympic bronze medallists India were overwhelming favourites before their semi-final against Japan after having thrashed the same opponents 6-0 in their last round robin match, but the Japanese had other plans.
The Japanese looked a completely different side as they toyed with the defence of the Manpreet Singh-led side from the beginning.
Shota Yamada’s first-minute penalty was quickly added to by Raiki Fujishima in the second minute and Yoshiki Kirishita made it 3-0 for Japan, the 2018 Asian Games gold-medallists, in the 14th.
Dilpreet Singh diverted the ball home to get one back from India in the 17th minute but Japan ended the contest with goals by Kosei Kawabe in the 35th and Ryoma Ooka three minutes later with both goals coming off swift counter-attacks.
Harmanpreet Singh (43rd) and Hardik Singh (58th) got India close but it was not enough.
It was only Japan’s second win against India in 19 matches.

Starc sustained the injury while batting in Adelaide but still claimed six wickets in the pink ball contest to help Australia prevail by 275 runs and go 2-0 ahead in the five-match series. 
“Boland has been training with the team in Adelaide and joins the squad while the medical team assesses the fast bowling group following the second Test victory,” Cricket Australia said in a statement on Tuesday. 
Boland, who has played 14 one-dayers and three Twenty20 Internationals, has been in strong form for Victoria this summer in Australia with 15 wickets from two matches against New South Wales. 
Australia were without Pat Cummins for the Adelaide test after the skipper was ruled out for being a close contact of a Covid-19 case, while fellow quick Josh Hazlewood was sidelined by a side strain sustained in the series opener in Brisbane. 
Both return to the squad on Thursday ahead of the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne. 
Squad: Pat Cummins (capt), Scott Boland, Alex Carey, Cameron Green, Marcus Harris, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Michael Neser, Jhye Richardson, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc, Mitchell Swepson, David Warner

The Pakistan Cricket Board said the 34-year-old Abid was in stable condition at a cardiac hospital in Karachi. He has been diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome. 
Acute coronary syndrome is associated with a sudden reduction or blockage of blood flow to the heart. 
“Abid was taken immediately to a cardiac hospital where he was diagnosed,” the PCB said in a statement. “He is under the care of consultant cardiologist who is liaising with PCB medical team regarding further treatment. He is currently stable.” 
Abid had completed his half century while representing Central Punjab against Khyber Pakhtunkhwa when he complained of pain around his chest and shoulder. 
Abid has been a regular for Pakistan over the last two years, scoring 1,180 runs in 16 Test matches. He’s the only batter to hit centuries both on his Test debut and ODI debut. He scored 112 against Australia in his ODI debut in March 2019 at Dubai and made an unbeaten 109 against Sri Lanka in his Test debut at Rawalpindi in December 2019. 
He was named player of the series in the recent two-Test series against Bangladesh where he scored 263 runs at an average of 87.66.

13,Yorkshire link up with Lahore Qalandars after racism scandal,LONDON: Yorkshire anno­­unced on Tuesday they had formed a partnership with Pakistan Super League team Lahore...,"LONDON: Yorkshire anno­­unced on Tuesday they had formed a partnership with Pakistan Super League team Lahore Qalandars that includes a player exchange programme following a damaging racism scandal at the English club.
Pakistan-born former player Azeem Rafiq accused Yorkshire of failing to deal adequately with his allegations of abuse while at the county, saying he had been driven to thoughts of suicide.
The chairman and chief executive left the club in November, followed earlier this month by the entire coaching staff.
Yorkshire, who have been accused of failing to nurture local cricketers of South Asian descent on their doorstep, said the new partnership was a chance to  “learn from and emulate” the Qalandars’ player development programme, which provides opportunities and kit to more than 150 young players.
Pakistan fast bowler Haris Rauf will join Yorkshire as an overseas player for part of the next season as part of the exchange programme aimed at enabling international players to learn from each other.
Scholarships will be available for young players from Yorkshire to play in Lahore and there will be opportunities for cricketers from Pakistan to come to England.
In addition, Yorkshire will play the Qalandars in a friendly fixture at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium on Jan 16.
Kamlesh Patel, the new chairman of Yorkshire, said he hoped the partnership would help create a county  “that is welcoming and supportive to all”.
“The work the Lahore Qalandars do both on and off the pitch is remarkable and can serve as a benchmark for clubs around the world — ours included — for how best to spot, foster and support talent at all levels in the game of cricket,” he added.
Interim director of cricket Darren Gough said he was  “thrilled” to welcome Haris, who has played ODI cricket and T20 cricket for Pakistan, and excited by the opportunity to learn from the player development programme.
“For many people from a background like mine, cricket isn’t seen as an option, with the associated costs and access to facilities creating real barriers to entry,” said the former Yorkshire and England fast bowler.
“This partnership is an opportunity to take the blueprint the Qalandars has developed to such a success and work with them to define how that can be used to provide access for potential players from across Yorkshire.”
