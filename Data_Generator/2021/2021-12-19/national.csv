1,Pakistan’s Covid-19 mortality rate much higher than global rate,"Task force member says citizens visit hospitals after developing complications, blames poor health and diagnostic facilities.","•  Task Force member says citizens visit hospitals after developing complications
•  Poor health, diagnostic facilities another reason for high number of deaths
ISLAMABAD: Though health experts have been claiming that Covid-19 has proved less lethal among Asians, global data shows that Pakistan’s mortality rate is far higher than many regions.
Member of the Scientific Task Force on Covid-19 Dr Javed Akram was of the view that more Pakistanis died beca­use they visited hospitals due to complications arising from Covid-19 rather than the infection itself. He also blamed poor health and diagnostic facilities for the high number of casualties. 
A document of the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC), available with Dawn, said the coronavirus mortality rate of Pakistan was 2.24 per cent against 1.97pc globally. It further showed that 28,870 deaths were reported across the country, out of which 61pc were males and 39pc females.
The minimum age of a Pakistani national who succumbed to the infection was two months and the maximum age was over 100 years, with the median age calculated at 62 years, the document revealed.
Out of the total number of deaths, 78pc were over the age of 50; 69pc had chronic comorbidity; and 91pc of the deceased were hospitalised with an average stay of 6.6 days (ranging from one day to 173 days). Similarly, 45pc of the hospitalised patients remained on ventilators with an average stay of 3.2 days (ranging from one day to 42 days).
The document showed that 172 deaths were reported among health staff, out of whom 103 were doctors, one was a medical student, four were nurses and 64 were paramedics.
Talking to Dawn, Dr Akram accepted that far more patients lost their lives in Pakistan compared to global percentage of deaths.
“Unfortunately in Pakistan people do not visit hospitals with Covid-19; rather they visit hospitals once they develop complications. Besides, we lack state-of-the-art health and diagnostic facilities,” he said, adding “our intensive care units remained under pressure or were overburdened due to which mortality ratio increased”.
When it was pointed out that the government had claimed 100pc ventilators were never occupied in Pakistan, Dr Akram said although there were the same kinds of people and economic conditions in Italy and France, more casualties were reported in Italy.
Dr Akram, who is also the vice chancellor of the Uni­versity of Health Sciences, said the situation might deteriorate across the globe in winter as 2.5 million people die of pneumonia every year in the cold season.
Meanwhile, the NCOC data showed that seven people died of coronavirus and 357 more tested positive in the last 24 hours. As many as 728 patients were admitted to hospitals across the country.

2,Three terrorists killed in two operations: ISPR,PESHAWAR: Three  terrorists were killed and a security official was injured in separate operations in Bajaur and...,"PESHAWAR: Three  terrorists were killed and a security official was injured in separate operations in Bajaur and North Waziristan tribal districts on Saturday. 
The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the military’s media wing, said se­­c­urity forces conducted intelligence-based and clea­ra­n­­c­­­e operations against terrorists in the two districts adja­cent to the Afghan border. 
A statement said that a terrorist named Ghafoor alias Jaleel, a close acqu­ain­tance of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakist­an’s leader Maulvi Faqir Mohammad, was killed during an operation in Bajaur. 
ISPR said that Jaleel was involved in many terrorist activities. He was killed in an exchange of fire, during which a security official was wounded. 
On Thursday evening, Mau­­lvi Faqir escaped unhurt from a suspected drone strike on a safe house in eastern Afgha­nistan. He was arrested by the previous US-backed Kabul government and spent years in Afghanistan’s notorious Bagram prison but was released after the Taliban’s lightning takeover of the country in August. 
Meanwhile, two terrorists were killed during a clearance operation in the Boya area of North Waziristan. The terrorists were spotted fleeing from Mohammad Khel village towards Vezda Sar and were killed during an exchange of fire.

3,Petition seeks Balochistan CM’s disqualification over viral video,The video shows CM Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo distributing money among the participants of the Gwadar sit-in.,"QUETTA: A petition has been filed in the Balochistan High Court, seeking disqualification of Chief Minister Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo after a video went viral on social media showing the chief minister distributing money among participants of the recently ended 31-day-long Gwadar sit-in.  
A spokesperson for the Balochistan government condemned what he called the propaganda against CM Bizenjo. 

 



 
The petition was filed by Advocate Amanullah Kanrani who pleaded the court to disqualify the chief minister for distributing money among the protesters. 
“The Chief Minister does not comply with Article 62 and 63 after paying money to protesters,” the petition said. 
The Balochistan government’s spokesperson claimed that CM Bizenjo distributed money among poor women and children outside the area where the sit-in was held. He said providing financial assistance to poor women is a tribal tradition in Balochistan and that there is nothing wrong with it. Criticising the chief minister for doing something which is a tradition of the province is unjustified, he added. 
The spokesperson said that some people are not happy over the peaceful end of the sit-in because they wanted to see some unrest in the province as a result of the protest. They are now frustrated and trying to some confusion on the basis of this video, he added. 
He said the peaceful end of the sit-in showed the political vision of CM Bizenjo and Maulana Hidayatur Rehman, who led the protest. 
The government spokesperson claimed that Maulana Hidayatur Rehman has also denied the report about distribution of money among protesters. 
He claimed that the people of Gwadar have welcomed the agreement which led to the peaceful end of the sit-in. He said the provincial government believes in resolving all issues through dialogues.

4,Opposition asks Imran to stop blaming previous govts for his failure,"""When will the incumbent government accept its responsibilities,"" PPP's Sherry Rehman asks.","LAHORE: The opposition has asked Prime Minister Imran Khan to stop blaming previous governments for his failures and concentrate on his performance. 
“Passing the buck to the Bhuttos and the Sharifs for his failures in more than three years in government, Imran Khan should know that this narrative has been outdated,” PPP Senator Sherry Rehman said in a series of tweets on Saturday. 

 



 
She said the PTI government had added to the country’s debts to the tune of 70 per cent amounting to Rs20.7 trillion and in the face of it he (Khan) is blaming others. 

 



 
“In a weekly report, inflation shot up to 19.5pc. Is the PTI government not responsible for record loans, unbridled inflation and price hike, unemployment and crises in over three years? When will the incumbent government accept its responsibilities and the PTI knows that it is in power,” she asked. 

PPP, PML-N berate PTI govt for its poor performance

The PPP Senator further said the premier had been under an illusion that except him all those in politics wanted to do corruption. “Contrary to this, the majority of Pakistan believes that corruption has increased in the regime of Imran Khan. The people will ask in the coming polls about the PTI government’s performance and by indulging only in blame games it cannot get away with its responsibilities,” she said. 
In an interview to foreign media on Friday, PM Khan had said the Bhutto and Sharif families were responsible for the country’s present situation. “Pakistan was rich in resources but the Bhutto and Sharif families had used the resources unfairly. My government wants Pakistan to become a prosperous country and it is fighting against the two families, which are super rich,” he said. 
PML-N’s information secretary Marriyum Aurangzeb also asked Imran Khan to stop trumpeting the same false accusations because his repetition would not make these cooked-up charges true. 
“Transparency International has already awarded the international certificate of corruption to this government and declared this Imran-led government a thief. Pakistan has dropped from 111th to 124th place because of the rampant corruption by Imran and his cronies,” she said in a statement. 
The former information minister said Mr Khan had enslaved the nation to the ‘corrupt mafia cartels’. She said the premier helped these ‘mafias’ rob billions in sugar, flour and medicine scandals and then blamed others for it. “Khan aided them to steal billions on Ring Road, Covid Funds, Tosha Khana, and other mega corruption scandals and still has the audacity to point fingers at others,” she said. 
Ms Aurangzeb said Mr Khan had been levelling these false allegations for the past 22 years and had been in government for over three years and yet he could not prove any of these accusations. “Had he spent this time and resources to solve the national issues, he might have gotten something done,” she lamented. 
She said the country was going deeper into economic recession, gas shortages, rising unemployment while Imran has nothing to offer but the same old, stale, baseless allegations that have already been questioned in courts. 
PPP secretary general Nayyar Bokhari said PM Khan and his cabinet members, whose kitchen was being run on official expense, had no idea that the country’s economy had reached the brink of disaster. 
“Handing over the keys of the country’s economy to the IMF is a crime and tantamount to enmity with the public,” Mr Bokhari said and added the PPP would continue holding protests against the government’s steps that caused price hike, making the lives of the people miserable.
