0,LDA hands over 122 kanals to health department for hospital,"Land once housed Kot Lakhpat fruit shops where clashes erupted between traders, town staff in 2011.","LAHORE: The Lahore Development Authority (LDA) has handed over the possession of  its 122 kanal land which once housed the Kot Lakhpat fruit and vegetable market to the Specialised Healthcare and  Medical Education Department (SH&MED) for construction of a 100-bed  hospital.  
The authority did this after it sold the land,  situated at prime location of Ferozepur Road near Arfa Karim Technology  Park, to the department for over Rs2 billion, Dawn has learnt.  
After the 2011 shifting the business to the newly-established fruit and vegetable market in Kaacha  village near Hadiara drain on Ferozepur Road, various organisations representing public and  private sector showed interest in procuring this precious chunk of land,  but the LDA didn’t sold it to anyone.  
However, it found  a proposal of the specialised healthcare department to buy the land  ‘reasonable.’ According to LDA, its governing body in its meeting held  in August this year finally accorded an approval to transfer physical possession to the department, subject to depositing of Rs2.033bn  with authority’s bank account before Feb 1, 2022.  

Land once housed Kot Lakhpat fruit shops where clashes erupted between traders, town staff in 2011

Accordingly,  the department, through its planning officer, submitted in writing  pledging that the cost of land would be deposited with the LDA accounts  soon after receiving funds from the Punjab government.  
“Since issuance  of allotment is mandatory before the physical possession, the case was  submitted to the LDA DG for issuance of the allotment letter to the  department subject to confirmation/ratification by the LDA governing  body after depositing of Rs2.033bn, approval of building plan from the  building control authority along with allied NOCs from the relevant  departments and restriction of the use of land for the purpose of  hospital alone and if there is any amendment required in the plan (use  of land for other purposes), it should be done by the respective  authority,” read minutes of a recent meeting of the LDA governing body.
The department was  further asked to not sublet the land to others or sub-divide it without  getting requisite NOCs. After fulfilling all conditions by the  department, the LDA recently issued allotment letter and handed over  physical possession of the land to the department.
“The authority  confirms the allotment and delivery of physical possession of the land  to the department, near Arfa Karim Technology Park,” reads the decision  of the authority taken in the governing body meeting.  
It merits mentioning that clashes had broken out in July 2011 between  traders  and officials of the then respective town municipal  administration when a  team along with the police launched a grand  operation to get 122 kanal  land (housing the Kot Lakhpat fruit and vegetable  market) vacated in line  with shifting the businesses to the  newly-established market.  
The TMA team and  police had faced immense  resistance from traders during the operation.  The protesters had also  thrashed some of the officials besides setting a  TMA truck on fire and  damaging another vehicle. They had also pelted  the police and TMA  officials with stones, leaving more than a dozen  injured.
They had blocked Ferozepur Road by setting used tyres  ablaze, throwing  traffic out of gear for almost three hours besides  chanting slogans  against the town administration and demanding action  against the  officials involved in torturing the traders. They were of  the view that  before shifting the existing market, the government should  have  provided all necessary facilities at the new site. The police had  also  launched a baton charge to disperse the protesters, leaving some of   them injured.  
They arrested over 100 protesters besides   registering cases against 500 or so on the complaint of the Gulberg TMO.
Since the protests by traders continued for a couple of months in  2011,  they finally shifted to the new place and the LDA took possession  of  its land.

3,Afghan medic moves LHC against PMC exam rules,LAHORE: A medical graduate from Afghanistan has asked the Lahore High Court to set aside the examination rules of ...,"LAHORE: A medical graduate from Afghanistan has asked the Lahore High Court to set aside the examination rules of the Pakistan Medical Commission (PMC) for foreign graduates for being “unlawful and discriminatory”.
Azhar Kamran, a resident of Lahore, completed his medical education from Nangarhar University, Afghanistan, recognised by the Higher Education Commission (HEC).
He has been conferred with the same MD degree equivalent to MBBS and declared eligible for registration examination by the National Examination Board for foreign medical graduates.  
The petitioner’s counsel, Advocate Awais Khalid, argues that no passing criteria has been given in the PMC Act 2020 as well as the PMC Conduct of Examination Regulations 2021 for passing the National Licensing Examination (NLE).
He states that the passing criteria developed by the National Medical & Dental Academic Board requires 70 percent of the total marks, separate for Step-I and Step-II, whereas passing ratio for the similar professional examinations is 50pc in Pakistan and all over the world.
The counsel says the petitioner registered himself for the NLE with the PMC and passed Step-I, but after obtaining even more than 60pc marks has been declared “fail” in Step-II though no such criteria has been fixed in the law and the regulations.
He argues that the petitioner has been discriminated against and subjected to the NLE Step-II, whereas the graduates from Pakistan are exempted from this step. He says the attempts have also been restricted for foreign graduates.
He pleads that the petitioner successfully completed medical education recognised by the respondent (PMC) outside Pakistan, but has been discriminated against without any reasonable classification.
The counsel argues that the Step-II of the NLE being conducted by the respondents is ultra vires to the provisions of section 20 of the PMC Act 2020.
Justice Sajid Mahmood Sethi would hear the petition on a date to be fixed by the registrar office, while notices have been issued to the respondents and also to the attorney general of Pakistan.

Addressing a gathering of the youth at Aiwan-i-Iqbal on Saturday, he said it was unfortunate that the country created for practising Islam was run under the opposite system. 
The Al-Khidmat Pakistan organised the event to motivate and train the young people for the welfare work. 
Addressing the youth, the JI chief said the PTI slogans of change and transforming the country into a Madina-like state proved to be a pack of lies. 
He said Prime Minister Imran Khan had deceived the youth with the promises to create jobs for them and end their problem. Instead of providing jobs, he added, the PTI had deprived millions of their livelihood due to ill-deceived policies. The PTI, he said, was the continuation of the PML-N and the PPP and it had failed to deliver.  
Mr Haq said there was a clear difference between the politics between the JI and other political parties and added that the status quo and prevailing system had made deep roots into the society in the last seven decades. 
The country’s economy, education, courts, banks were being run on western lines, he lamented and said that the JI was fighting to change the system in peaceful democratic manner.

7,Harking Back: ‘Slave’ syndrome that has become part of our psyche,A few days ago a news item on the front page of this newspaper about Lahore having the highest number of domestic...,"A few days ago a news item on the front page of this newspaper about Lahore having the highest number of domestic employees – still described as ‘servants’ – who are beaten up, raped, injured and locked up, some even chained, with a few being killed, was appalling. This inhuman aspect of our lives needs attention.
But the idea of writing about the slaves of Lahore over the ages was instigated by a ‘Letters to the Editor’ piece in The Guardian newspaper where an old man took his grandson to Liverpool harbour and they sat down on a circle of blocks of stone. “This is where the cage for slave auctioning once existed. This is a memorial to them poor people”. Britain is slowly opening up to its appalling past, and the process brings forth new revelations every day. But then attitudes are changing fast thanks to the ‘Black Lives Matter’ movement, though it might take eons before that consciousness comes to Lahore.
Slavery is a touchy subject when it comes to our religion, but I am an ardent admirer of Hazrat Bilal ibn Rabah, also known as Bilal Habashi. To my way of thinking he is the most important Companion of the Holy Prophet (PBUH), yet ignored because of his colour and economic condition. His autobiography when read is enough to give you goose pimples. It was translated by the Trinity College Dublin scholar H.A.L Craig when he found the manuscript in the Vatican Library. But the manner in which he was treated by other ‘Muslims’ is a sad reflection of the inborn racism that exists in Arab society still. The situation in the sub-continent is worse.
Bilal’s father was an Arab slave of the Banu Jumah clan, while his mother was an Ethiopian royal princess, both captured during the events of ‘Amul Feel’. Bilal was born in Mecca and initially was a slave of the cruel Umayyah ibn Khalaf. The Holy Prophet (PBUH) insisted that Hazrat Abu Bakr (RA) purchase him as he had already converted to Islam and was tortured and flogged on a daily basis. It is an accepted fact that because he was a black slave he could not reach the lofty heights he truly deserved in a tribal Arab society. He was taunted as ‘ibn Sauda’, son of a black woman. But he was a free man in Damascus where he died. My contention is that the ‘ibn Sauda’ mind-set exists in all of us, much that we may deny it. We conveniently forget that our past Afghan, Iranian, Turkish and even the British rulers all excelled in the slave trade.
But the most famous slave that Lahore ‘prides’ itself in is Ayaz the white Georgian slave of Russian descent of the Afghan-Turk invader Mahmud. He died in mysterious circumstances, probably poisoned, and was buried outside the walls of the then walled city on the 8th of August, 1041. Our history books tell us that he was the Governor of Lahore, which is grossly incorrect. His grave managed to reach the Shahalami Chowk after Akbar expanded the city and the ‘rahra maidan’ outside became part of the new walled city.
The 11th century Arab historian Al-Utbi in his famous ‘Tarkh al-Tamini’ says that in the year 1001 AD when Mahmud of Ghazni invaded the sub-continent, from Peshawar and Waihand, the Gandhara capital, he captured thousands of slaves, which got him immense wealth. But on his 12th invasion he captured over 600,000 slaves from Lahore and its surroundings. The slave market of the then known world hit an ‘over-supply’ situation which resulted in a dramatic fall in slave prices.
When I visited London a few years ago I was led by a friend to the grave of Solomon Nurr, who lies buried in St Margaret’s Church in Westminster with the date March 22, 1550, written on the tombstone. This Lahori whose original name was Salman Nur, ended up in Shakespearean England, probably taken a slave on a ship, and ended up, most probably using his clever mind in a Westminster church. Lahoris never cease to amaze.
A lot of research is underway in European universities on the ‘changars’ of Lahore and others from Punjabi river banks, all of whom were captured and taken away by Timurlane to service his horsemen as ‘blacksmiths’, itself a racist description. But then we have from time to time mentioned in these columns the UNO-WHO research on the gypsies who have ended up all over the world.
During a visit to the Welsh village of Hay-on-Wye, the world’s largest used book stores village, I came across some gypsies who I managed to converse in broken Punjabi. It was an amazing experience. They claimed, as research and DNA studies have now verified, to have come from the rivers of the Punjab. Research has confirmed that even the gypsies roaming around in South America have Punjabi genes. The Spanish dumped them there to rid Christian Spain of these ‘criminals’ as a Portuguese document calls them.
Extensive research on Portuguese gypsies in the University of Porto has proven beyond doubt that all those removed from our river banks and cities like Lahore centuries ago by our past rulers by the millions have the same DNA as gypsies all over the world. But then in our villages, a terrible example of a feudal-tribal order, the poor are worse than slave labour, for they just get enough food to survive and are often referred to as ‘kami’ (the lesser). It is interesting how people from our river banks were all picked up as slaves and sold in markets as far away as Liverpool in England and Dublin in Ireland, which were large ‘Slave Markets’.
In the 8th century Italian merchants moved up in the opposite direction capturing Slavic slaves for the lucrative North African markets. Amazingly in Genoa a major slave trade existed for Asian slaves for the European markets and white slaves to Egypt and even to parts of Iran and Indian sub-continent.
The final nail in making slavery official was Aurangzeb’s ‘Fatwa-e-Alamgiri’. The degree of depravity reflected in that terrible document led to the complete collapse of the Mughal order and provided colonialism an opening. On the other hand it allowed the exploited common person a chance to rise against such a disposition. That led to the rise of Khalsa Raj, an egalitarian disposition with faults of its own. But at least the people were relatively free, finally.
The question that our history throws up is how we treat our domestic employees, and whether our society can long tolerate the way we treat the poor, who we proudly call ‘servants’. The signs of collapse, coupled with corruption unfettered, is there to be seen. But the poor will one day find better solutions. The first signs are there as our investors move to greener pastures. Has the ‘implosion’ started? Fifty years ago we called our East Pakistani citizens ‘bingos’. They have managed well by doubling per capita income and lowering their population, free from religiosity and hatred of education.
With these depressing thoughts as we move into a long fortnight holiday season, my intention is to read a few rare books of history. My choice till we return to ‘normal’ academic life are Tarikh-i-Firishta (Lucknow, 1864), Andre Wink’s classic ‘Al-Hind’ (1991), Eaton and Chatterjee’s edited collection: ‘Slavery and South Asian History’ (2006). Wishing those celebrating Christmas a great time.

In his address, PU Vice Chancellor Prof Niaz Ahmad urged the students to understand their responsibilities and contribute to the development of society. He said rigorous efforts had been put in the higher education institutions of Pakistan due to which they were making rapid progress; otherwise, the universities could have faced the same fate as other national public sector institutions were suffering from.  
Prof Ahmad claimed that in 2018, the PU’s position in Asian ranking of the universities by QS was 232nd while in 2021, it had been declared 145th best university in Asia. He said that for the first time in 2018, the PU’s 3 subjects were ranked at international level and now in 2021, it had become the only university in Pakistan whose 13 subjects had been ranked while in the subject of petroleum engineering, the PU had been ranked among the top 100-150 institutions in the world. 
Referring to the number of initiatives taken in the university, the VC said for the first time, the PU was being run by statutory bodies and their regular meetings were being held as per the requirements of the university calendar. He said seven meetings of the PU Senate had been held in the 3.5 years while in the recent past, a gap of eight to 10 years could be witnessed between the two meetings of the Senate.  
He added that the number of professors and associate professors at the university had never crossed the figure of 70 each but now it had more than 150 professors and 150 associate professors. He claimed that the university had given special attention to those research projects, which aimed at solving socioeconomic problems and contributed towards national development. 
Prof Niaz Ahmad said that for the first time, regular appointments of professionals had been made on the most coveted administrative posts of registrar, controller, resident officer 1 etc through advertisement and teachers had been relieved from such assignments while the appointment of Pro VC had also been ensured to create a second leadership. He urged the students to become law-abiding citizens and adopt good behaviour. 
He congratulated all the graduating students and their parents. 
Prof Dr Saleem Mazhar also spoke.  
Later, the VC presented a special souvenir to Registrar Dr Khan, retiring on Dec 31, for his services at the university.

In a statement issued here on Saturday, Mr Buzdar said the government was fully aware of people’s problems and indiscriminate action was being taken against those involved in artificial price hike. He assured the people that the Ehsaas Ration Programme would provide relief to the public in the real sense. 
The chief minister regretted that opposition parties were engaged in political point-scoring on all the important national issues, including Covid-19 and dengue, in the past and now they were making hullabaloo on price hike just to gain political mileage. He said these elements had nothing to do with the people’s problems but they wanted to enter the power corridors only and added that such people were unaware of the basics of the economy.  
Mr Buzdar said those using negative tactics should know that there was no room in Pakistan for their politics of do or die, resignations and long march. He said the government resources were ruthlessly looted in the past and the former rulers used their offices for money laundering and receiving kickbacks. 
The CM claimed that the present government had made a substantial increase of Rs85bn in an annual development programme for the year 2021-22 and the volume of annual ADP had reached Rs645bn now.

According to sources, VC Arshad Ahmed had asked Provost and Chief Academic Officer Dr Farhat Haq to remove Law School Faculty Dean Sadaf Aziz as he wanted to appoint a foreigner against the post.
However, a source claimed that the provost did not agree with the VC and instead asked him to increase the salary of Ms Aziz to bring her on a par with other faculty deans. But, the VC showed displeasure and took the decision of sacking the provost on Dec 10 (the same day), the source said. The VC had earlier also asked Ms Haq to tender her resignation but she refused, the sources added. 
The VC did not took calls and ignored a text message by this reporter for his stance.
Meanwhile, as many as 130 members of different faculties at LUMS have written to the VC to withdraw his decision of sacking Provost Ms Haq.
In the letter, the faculty members said the manner in which LUMS terminated Dr Haq’s contract violated her dignity and respect.  
It says Dr Haq’s termination appears arbitrary, without cause, and unfair. Even the members of the VC Council find the process to dismiss her opaque. Moreover, LUMS did not inform the deans, vice provost, and members of the university council about the cause of her dismissal.It states, in fact, the VC’s email to the LUMS community acknowledges that Dr Had has critically contributed to issues of health and safety, teaching excellence, and faculty career progression in her short time as provost. 
It states if left unaddressed, the perception of arbitrariness and lack of due process will damage the sanctity of LUMS’s appointments and tenure process and its ability to recruit and retain quality faculty and administrators. This perception also adversely influences how the VC, university, and school councils function since it suggests that those who dissent or disagree will likely bear serious repercussions. Such risks affect the morale of faculty, staff, and administrators, particularly the female colleagues, it mentions.
It states, the dismissal of LUMS’s first female senior administrator, reinforces the feeling that the university discriminates based on gender. Gender-based hostility is an issue raised repeatedly by female faculty members, it adds.  
It also questions the absence of any mechanism to acknowledge, investigate, and safeguard against gender-based and other forms of discrimination.
It says Dr Haq’s dismissal and the lack of dignity and respect afforded to her has shaken LUMS’ ethical foundations, jeopardising its governance structure, stated values and mission, and image in Pakistan and abroad.
The faculty members seek immediate convening of the university council to share the process and cause for Dr Haq’s dismissal and in case of it failing to explain the VCs action, they want her reinstated as provost.

Thieves have stolen the main gate, lights, electricity pole and sports equipment of the complex.
In 2007, the Narowal district administration built the complex on two acres adjacent to the old deputy commissioner’s office with funds from the district sports.  
The complex has a jogging track and volleyball, basketball and open badminton courts. Lights and electric poles were also installed for night matches. Regular rooms and washrooms were also set up at the complex, while steps were built for spectators to watch sports competitions.  
A water turbine was installed to provide drinking water to sportsmen and a water tank was also constructed at the venue.
A boundary wall was constructed by installing iron fences at the facility to prevent unauthorised persons and animals from entering the open sports courts.  
The district administration and the district sports department handed over the complex to the Government Boys Degree College, Narowal, after the completion of the construction work. The complex, however, could not be made functional due to the incompetence of the Higher Education Department.  
Now, the floor of the volleyball court has worn out while grass and bushes have covered the playing areas of the complex.
A clerk of the local university of engineering has made his residence in the pavilion of the mini-sports complex. The turbine and water tank have never made functional in the 14 years.
Locals Muhammad Saleem and Suleiman Ali said the government spent millions on the complex, but it could not make it functional for college students and local youth.  
Mr Ibrahim said during the last 14 years, the students never got any chance to use the sports complex, so no sports competition could be held there.
District Sports Officer Muhammad Asghar said district sports funds were spent on the complex and it was the responsibility of the Higher Education Department to maintain it and make it functional.
Local citizens and sportsmen have demanded that Chief Minister Usman Buzdar get the sports complex rehabilitated and make it functional for the local youth.
