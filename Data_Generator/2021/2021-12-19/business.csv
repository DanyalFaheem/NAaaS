0,Pakistan Mercantile Exchange keen on cash-settled crypto contracts,PMEX managing director says central monetary authority should revisit the 2018 decision against cryptocurrencies.,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Mercantile Exchange (PMEX) is eager to introduce cash-settled contracts  of cryptocurrencies to help local investors take exposure to the  increasingly popular peer-to-peer global digital payment system.
Speaking to Dawn  in a recent interview, PMEX Managing Director Ejaz Ali Shah said the  central monetary authority should revisit its 2018 decision against  cryptocurrencies because they’re getting worldwide recognition as a  medium of exchange.
“It’s only a matter of time. How can you stay  away from something that’s being adopted by the rest of the world so  rapidly?” said Mr Shah who heads the country’s only commodity futures  exchange.
Dealing in cryptocurrencies is officially banned in  Pakistan, although the country boasts of having one of the highest cryptocurrency adoption rates globally, according to the 2021 Global  Crypto Adoption Index by Chainalysis.
Yet its growing traction  continues to stay under the radar because of the numerous operators  running illegal futures trading platforms across the country. “Drive  through Sharea Faisal and you’ll come across such operators after  every kilometre. They’re connected with foreign brokers and work as  their local agents,” he said, adding that these are illegal entities and  should be shut down at once.
By his own estimate, the PMEX is  handling only five per cent of the total futures trading business that’s  currently taking place in the country.
Futures trading
From  gold, silver, oil and gas to copper, palladium and even the indexes of  global stock exchanges, the PMEX lets roughly 25,000 investors buy and  sell different sorts of contracts on its platform every day. Except for some  contracts in gold that are deliverable, all of them are cash-settled as  their values are tied to the international commodity prices.
Trading  on the PMEX takes place on margin. For example, an investor has to come  up with only Rs5 to buy a contract of Rs100. They make a profit of Rs2  if the price increases to Rs102 and book a loss of Rs2 if the price  declines to Rs98. Although they never get the actual delivery of the  commodity, businesses can theoretically hedge against volatility in the  prices of their input materials through the PMEX.
“We have a  state-of-the-art trading system in place. Allowing cryptocurrencies  will ensure that there’s no outflow of foreign exchange. All dealings  will be in rupees. It’ll be documented and can be taxed. We’ll do KYC  [know-your-customer] and ensure investor protection. The SBP should  review its decision,” he said.
Contracts of treasury bills
In  addition to cryptocurrencies, the PMEX has been working on a proposal  to introduce contracts of treasury bills on the exchange, which will  complement the government’s plan to promote retail participation in the  trading of its short-term debt.
“We’re holding serious discussion  with the SBP on this issue. The central bank is very keen on it. They’ve  told me in principle that they want the PMEX to do it. We’re now  developing a proposal and coming up with the modalities for their  review,” he said.
The government has long been pushing the  Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), the only national platform for shares  trading, to develop a secondary marketplace for short-term government  debt. However, that’s not happened so far because the PSX’s client base  is mainly corporate, according to Mr Shah.
“Those corporates have  their own treasuries. They don’t need the PSX for trading in treasury  bills. Similarly, stockbrokers have little interest in this segment.  
Banks resist it as well because retail participation will cannibalise  their deposit base,” he said, noting that the mainly retail nature of  the PMEX investor base makes the exchange a perfect platform for the  promotion of treasury bills.

1,SBP assurance on future rate hikes turns stocks bullish,KARACHI: The modest interest  rate hike of 100 basis points with a State Bank of Pakistan (SBP)  assurance of no...,"KARACHI: The modest interest  rate hike of 100 basis points with a State Bank of Pakistan (SBP)  assurance of no further increase in the near term lifted the investor  sentiments with the  result that the stock market closed the outgoing week on a  bullish note. 
The benchmark  KSE-100 index posted a week-on-week gain of 505 points, or 1.2pc, at 43,900.68.
According  to Arif Habib Ltd, the Pakistan Stock Exchange began the week on a  negative note amid anticipation of a massive hike in the policy rate.  Moreover, the expectation of the announcement of a mini-budget further  dented the sentiment. 
However, the market recovered  post-monetary policy announcement as clarity was provided by the SBP in  its forward guidance. The central bank also disclosed that it is close  to achieving a mildly positive real interest rate, which further boosted  investor sentiment as the index went up by 1,200 points on  Wednesday. In addition, on the external front, growth in remittances by  9.7 per cent to $12.9bn in 5MFY22 was a positive development.
However,  bears returned as investors resorted to profit-taking. Furthermore, the  rupee witnessed another all-time low of Rs178.04 against the US dollar  in the interbank market. 
According to AKD Securities, the  sentiment was disturbed by the recently concluded T-bill auction with  the cut-off yield remaining flat, reflecting a large divergence between  the current policy rate and the yield.  The  average trading volume also improved to 265.0m shares against 203.8m  shares in the previous week. 
Furthermore, the IMF projects gross debt at 83.4pc of GDP and SNGPL suspends gas supply to captive power plants in Punjab.
Foreign  selling continued this week, clocking in at $3.5 million compared to a  net sell of $0.99m last week. Major selling was witnessed in cement sector ($1.9m) and technology and communications ($1.9m). On the local front,  buying was reported by companies ($5.1m) followed by individuals  ($2.7m). Average volumes clocked in at 265m shares (up by 30pc  weekon-week) while average value traded settled at USD 84mn (up by 13%  WoW).
Sector-wise positive contributions came from cement (282  points), technology & communication (173 points), textile composite  (74 points), engineering (70 points), and refinery (50 points). Whereas,  sectors that contributed negatively were commercial banks (208 points)  and fertiliser (17 points). Scrip-wise positive contributors were TRG  (112 points), Lucky Cement (111 points), MLCF (45 points), System Ltd  (43 points) and CHCC (36 points). Meanwhile, scrip-wise negative  contribution came from MCB Bank (71 points), UBL (63 points) and MEBL  (29 points).
Gurus expect the market to remain  positive in the upcoming week. With the recent injection by the SBP via  open market operation for 63 days, money market yields are expected to  come down further.

2,Non-textile exports jump 25pc in July-November,Overall growth in the non-textile sector is mainly led by the value-added sectors.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s non-textile exports grew 24.59 per cent year-on-year to $4.61 billion in the first five months of the current fiscal year owing to the partial revival of international orders and the government support schemes.
Overall growth in the non-textile sector is mainly led by the value-added sectors. The non-textile sectors have yet to receive full orders to pre-Covid levels, showed data compiled by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS).
In FY21, three sectors — leather garments, surgical instruments and engineering goods — have maintained growth in export proceeds despite lockdowns in many countries.
In the value-added leather sector, exports of leather garments up by 10.42pc, leather gloves 11.81pc respectively. The exports of raw leather increased by 37.96pc in 5MFY22, which is indicating that it is not fully being used in the domestic value-added domestic industries.
Pakistan is one of the main suppliers of global surgical instruments. However, these instruments are re-marketed from western countries with famous brands. As a result, the export value of these products remain very less. 
The exports of surgical instruments posted a negative growth of 3.35pc, followed by 0.59pc decline in pharmaceutical products during the period under review.
The export of footwear increased by 13.91pc in 5MFY22, led by leather and canvas footwear. The export of engineering products up 16.42pc mainly led by machinery specialised for particular industries, auto parts and accessories and other machinery. However, the export of electric fans and transport equipment posted a negative growth during the months under review.
The exports of carpets up by 17.89pc in 5MFY22, followed by an increase of 24.48pc in foreign sales of sport goods. The sales of football up by 19.34pc and gloves 12.9pc, respectively.
In the budget 2021-22, the government has proposed several measures including reduction in duty on raw materials to promote exports of pharmaceutical, plastic, chemicals, engineering, and value-added textile products.
Food shortages in domestic market and lesser demand in international market led to overall drop in demand for Pakistani food products, especially fruits.
However, the PBS data showed that the food exports posted a growth of 26.89pc in the 5MFY22 from a year ago. Under this category, exports of rice witnessed an increase of 13.07pc. On the other hand, basmati exports edged up 32.99pc in value and 45.48pc in quantity while non-basmati exports were up by 5.74pc in value.
The export of spices was up by 29.63pc, followed by oil seeds, nuts 478pc, meat and products 0.10pc. However, export of fish product declined by 9.72pc during the period under review. Contrary to this, export of vegetables up by 31.47pc, fruits 27.69pc, tobacco 26.96pc. 
The exports of furniture up by 206pc during July-November period.
The exports of cement dropped by 6.21pc in 5MFY22 followed by 1.63pc in exports of jewellery, 69.23pc in molasses, 100pc in handicrafts, and 1.47pc in gur and its products.

3,"Sales of low-price bikes decline, but those of costly ones rise",The prices of locally assembled Japanese and Chinese bikes have been raised multiple times this year.,"KARACHI: In a surprising development, sales of low-priced motorcycles has been declining in recent months but that of locally assembled foreign bikes rising, despite soaring food inflation and utility bills.  
Prices of locally assembled Japanese and Chinese bikes have been raised multiple times this year, but it is the low-priced bikes that have taken a hit as sales of costly bikes have remained unaffected.  
Atlas Honda Limited (AHL) has been beating its own sales record while many assemblers of Chinese bikes have been struggling hard to regain lost ground.  
AHL recorded the highest monthly sales of 128,503 units in November, surpassing its own record of 125,031 units sold in October.  
In the July-November period, the AHL sales rose to 563,575 units as compared to 512,010 in the same period last year.  
In the five-month period sales of locally assembled Japanese bikes Suzuki and Yamaha rose to 14,915 and 9,962 units from 8,719 and 8,733 units last year, thus recording an increase of 71 per cent and 14pc, respectively.  
The sales of Chinese bike assemblers Road Prince and United Auto Motorcycle plunged by 23pc and 20pc to 52,289 and 136,812 units respectively.  
The sales of Ravi bikes were 53pc lower with 1,810 units as compared to 3,879 units.  
Industry and market stakeholders offer differing views about the changing market trends for the cheap and costly two-wheelers.  
Sohail Usman, the group chairman of Road Prince Motorcycles, said a number of buyers of Chinese bikes had certainly shifted towards Honda 70cc motorcycles, which was evident from its record-breaking sales in November.  
He said the buyers in urban areas, whose income has shrunk and are getting low salaries, have stayed away from purchasing even low-priced Chinese bikes due to affordability issues.  
Also, competition among assemblers of Chinese bikes has intensified because of which quality maintained by them has suffered, he said.   
A dealer with outlet on the Akbar Road, Karachi, Mohammad Sabir Sheikh, said soaring food prices and utility bills had hit low-income and middle-class buyers hard, whose first choice used to be locally assembled Chinese bikes owing to their low prices. For the last few months, however, such buyers had slowed down on buying two-wheelers.  
He said that growers/farmers in the rural areas prefer buying Honda bikes rather than the Chinese brands. Due to better crops and good crop prices the farming community mainly turned to buying costly Japanese bikes, especially Honda.  
Mr Sheikh said the total bike production in FY22 would remain lower in view of the depressed demand for Chinese bikes but the current fiscal year would end with rising production of Japanese bike assemblers.  
He was of the opinion that a new trend was emerging under which owners of high-priced car also bought Japanese bikes instead of Chinese ones. This is creating an additional demand for the branded Japanese bikes.  
According to data pertaining to Large Scale Manufacturing, the country’s bike production in July-October 2021 fell by 5pc to 769,802 units from 807,230 units in the same period last fiscal. In October 2021, production came down by 13pc to 192,450 units from 221,655 units in October last year.  
Mr Sheikh said the Chinese bikes of 70cc capacity had become costlier, rising to Rs69,000 from Rs41,000 two years ago, followed by Honda 70cc bikes to Rs94,500 from Rs65,000.  
Honda CG-125 is now available for Rs152,500 as compared to Rs108,000, while Suzuki 150cc sells at Rs232,000 as compared to Rs168,000. Yamaha 125cc bike is sold at Rs190,000 now as compared to Rs132,000 two years back.  
Some assemblers of Japanese bikes said that actually the buyers of new Chinese bikes are those people who used to own used motorcycles but who are now trying to turn to new units. However, declining purchasing power is not allowing them to own even a new low-cost bike if compared to Honda CD70cc.  
They said the mindset of people had also changed a lot since last year as many people with ample cash in hand prefer costly Japanese bikes.  
Benefits offered by a number of dealers of Japanese bikes are also proving to be a factor in the urban areas. The dealers take Rs50,000-70,000 from the buyers in advance and ask them to pay the rest of the money on monthly installments with a small interest, they said.  
Buyers interested in long tours also buy power bikes of 125cc-150cc capacity. This trend has gained momentum from Rawalpindi. Buyers in Karachi and Lahore are also purchasing such bikes due to better suspension and engine performance than Chinese heavy bikes, they added.  
They said the buyers of Chinese bikes wanted to get a unit for around Rs40,000. Now such buyers are becoming reluctant to invest in them after their prices have surged appreciably.

4,"SECP strikes off 3,000 non-performing firms","There are around 156,198 registered companies in the country.","ISLAMABAD: The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) has decided to strike off more than 3,000 non-performing companies from its books in a bid to streamline the working of registered companies.   
The SECP has served final notices to 2,094 companies registered in Peshawar, 462 in Quetta, 844 in Multan, 26 in Faisalabad and six in Gilgit. The names of 198 companies were struck off by the Companies Registration Office Lahore. 
The strike-off action has been initiated under Section 425 of the Companies Act, 2017 against the companies that have been “ineffective” for the last three years. Many companies were set up but the managers later decided not to pursue the operations of or fulfill regulatory requirements, an SECP official said, adding: “At the same time, the SECP continues to forward notices to the managements of such non-performing firms.” 
There are around 156,198 registered companies in the country. According to the SECP official, the regulator is in a position to strike off even up to 10,000 companies. 
SECP chairman Amir Khan told Dawn there was a need to ease up the wind-up procedures for the companies. “The wind-up procedure has to be easy, but at the same time there has to be protection for investors and minority shareholders,” he said. 
The number of company registration has increased significantly in the past three years witnessing a growth of more than 60 per cent, from 93,000 in December 2018. The main reason for the rapid growth in the registration of new companies is the end-to-end digitisaion facility available for company formation. 
“Now any company can be established within a day, without any paperwork, and even the registration certificate is delivered online,” Mr Khan said.

5,SNGPL seeks Ogra’s nod for spending Rs46.5bn on uplift projects,"300,000 new connections are part of the planned schemes.","LAHORE: The Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) has asked the Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) to allow it to spend Rs46.525 billion for execution of several development schemes, including 300,000 new gas connections to domestic consumers during the ongoing fiscal year (FY22) ending on June 30, 2022. 
The SNGPL has also sought permission for executing two mega projects worth Rs2.946bn on 100 per cent cost sharing basis during FY22, Dawn has learnt. 
“In the company’s estimated revenue requirement (ERR), it was planned to provide 1.2 million new connections during the FY22. However, later, through the Review of Estimated Revenue Requirement (RERR 2021-22), it was decided to at least provide new connections to the consumers, who have already paid requisite fees (including urgent cases). Those who have already paid fees are approximately 275,000,” an official source explained while talking to Dawn on Saturday. 

300,000 new connections are part of the planned schemes

According to a document made available to Dawn, the company plans to lay pipelines for the provision of Regasified Liquefied Natural Gas (RLNG) to industries, housing schemes, colonies and other major consumers. The cost to be incurred on these schemes has been estimated as Rs2.400bn that would be exclusively provided by the private sector (sponsors/owners of the projects). Similarly, the company would also lay a pipeline network for the provision of 10mmcfd RLNG to Bhalwal Industrial City (Special Economic Zone). Rs546m to be incurred on this scheme would be paid by the respective departments. 
The document mentions laying of new pipelines (5,000 kilometers) in various parts of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for Rs19.073bn by the SNGPL with its own expense, laying of pipelines (300 km long) in small streets for Rs767m, 135km long system augmentation for Rs1.201bn, laying and fitting of new pipes for Rs720m, installation of 300,000 new connections for Rs5.235bn, schemes related to system rehabilitation for Rs4.307bn, schemes related to monitoring of UFG (Unaccounted for Gas) losses for Rs3.345bn, carrying out UFG control activities for Rs730m, transportation for Rs200m, augmentation/bifurcation of gas network in Lahore City (Phase-II) for Rs2.363bn, Charsadda-Khazana-Tangi transmission system augmentation (Phase-II) for Rs826m, Compression Overhaul Project (2021-26) for Rs533m and other schemes/activities for Rs7.225bn. 
“With the completion of the aforementioned schemes, the SNGPL’s gas pipeline network would be expanded as well as strengthened,” the official said, adding that the backlog of those seeking new gas connections has reached to around 3.5m applications. 
He said the company is trying hard to provide new connections at maximum. The backlog continues to increase due to annual addition of a hundreds of thousands of new applicants seeking new gas connections, he added.
