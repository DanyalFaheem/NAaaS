0,Death toll from Philippines typhoon tops 30,Typhoon Rai ravages southern and central regions; knocks out communications and electricity in many areas.,"SURIGAO CITY: More than 30 people were killed in the strongest typhoon to hit the Philippines this year, official figures showed on Saturday, with a charity reporting “alarming” destruction on islands that bore the brunt of the storm. 
Hundreds of thousands fled their homes and beachfront resorts as Typhoon Rai ravaged the southern and central regions of the archipelago, knocking out communications and electricity in many areas, ripping off roofs and toppling concrete power poles. 
Rai was a super-typhoon when it smashed into the popular tourist island of Siargao on Thursday, packing maximum sustained winds of 195 kilometres per hour. 
Aerial photos shared by the military showed widespread damage in the town of General Luna, where many surfers and holidaymakers had flocked ahead of Christmas, with buildings stripped of roofs and debris littering the ground. 
“Everything was flying, it was as if it was the end of the world,” Raphy Repdos, a tour operator visiting the island when the storm hit, said. 
“The wind sounded angry and roaring, as if it wanted to demolish the building.”
The neighbouring island of Dinagat had been “levelled to the ground” by the storm, Governor Arlene Bag-ao wrote on Facebook, saying houses, boats and fields were destroyed. 
“Walls and roofs were torn and blown off by Odette like paper,” Bag-ao said, using the local name for the typhoon. 
“We have a dwindling supply of food and water. Electricity and telecommunications are down.” 
Rai’s wind speeds eased to 150kph as it barrelled across the country, dumping torrential rain that flooded villages, uprooting trees and shattering wooden structures.

• Muslim leaders never portrayed ‘real Islam’ before West

ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan, while calling corruption the reason behind a country’s destruction, said nations became poor not due to lack of resources but because of corruption of their leadership. 
“Corruption destroys a country. Countries are poor not because of lack of resources, but because their leadership is corrupt,” the prime minister said in an interview with Al Jazeera on Friday. He said the developing world was poor because its ruling elite siphoned off money and laundered it into offshore accounts. 
The premier further said the two guiding principles of the state of Madina were rule of law and public welfare. A society is called civilised only when it has rule of law. “When ministers start stealing, you cannot make progress,” he remarked. 
Talking about his political struggle, he said his fight was against the “corrupt ruling elite” that was destroying the country, adding that there were two family-led political parties and fighting them was like fighting a mafia. He alleged that both the parties used money, state resources as well as the media against him. 
When asked about his cricket career, Mr Khan said the zeal for cricket ran in his family and his cousins and uncles played the game. Sports inculcated the ability to cope with tough times and defeat, and the dynamics of picking oneself up again, he added. 
He said he spent some additional years playing cricket just to remain in the limelight and build a cancer hospital. For that very cause, he became the biggest fundraiser from an introvert and shy person, he recalled. 
He said Shaukat Khanum Cancer Hospital was the first such facility in the private sector in the world treating 75 per cent patients free of charge. He would never have been able to build the hospital if he had not learnt how to struggle for a cause from the game.  
He further said he wanted to build Pakistan on the model of the state of Madina. Earlier, Pakistan was being ruled by “two corrupt families” who came into power just for making money. 
Mr Khan said he would order a probe if anyone pointed out corruption by any of his ministers. The authorities were introducing automation to remove any chances of fraud, he added. 
In response to a question, the prime minister claimed his government had inherited the highest-ever debt, fiscal deficit and current account deficit that took time to recover from. Like other developing countries, Pakistan was also faced with inflation owing to the hike in prices of imported commodities such as edible oil and pulses, he further said. 
The PM also explained that Pak­istan was declared among the best countries for having effectively navigated through the Covid-19 pandemic by maintaining a balance between lives and livelihoods. 
He said that in order to do away with disparity in the education system the government had introduced a single core curriculum with consensus and consultation of all stakeholders. 
About Islamophobia, Mr Khan complained that Muslim leaders had never portrayed the “real Islam” before the West, particularly after 9/11. “Due to this, Muslims living in western countries faced Islamophobia despite the fact that terrorism was not linked to Islam,” he explained. 
He said he could not bring about any change all by himself and the whole Muslim world must adopt a joint stance at international fora like the UN to make a difference. He advised the youth to adopt the life of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) as a role model. “They should know how he transformed the characters of people and turned them into leaders. He was Rehmatullil Aalamin, a blessing for the entire mankind, not just for Muslims. Anyone who follows his model will rise,” the prime minister said. 
Regarding the situation in Afghanistan, he said it was insane what the West had been doing in the country for 20 years. No Afghan was involved in the September 11 attacks, yet the western world occupied Afghanistan to achieve the objectives that could never be achieved through military means. And he was criticised for maintaining this stance, he stressed. 
He said Pakistan was faced with a difficult situation after the exit of the US and the subsequent Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. The world, including the US, should think rationally for the sake of 40 million people or the situation would lead towards chaos and terrorism as the militant Islamic State group was already present there, he warned. 
“In case of any chaos in Afghanistan, Pakistan will suffer the most as the country was already hosting over a million refugees,” he emphasised. 
Regarding the Kashmir dispute, he said Pakistan had a responsibility to raise the issue at every forum. If India conducted a strike on Pakistani soil, it would be responded to exactly the way it had been done in 2019, he said. 
Only those not in their right mind could think of bringing two nuclear powers face to face. “Indian people are good but they are being ruled by fanatics,” he remarked.

2,LHC orders amendment in Nikahnama to settle dower issue,"Govts told to categorise the dower as an amount in cash, moveable property and immovable property with specification.","LAHORE: The Rawalpindi bench of the Lahore High Court (LHC) has ordered the federal and Punjab governments to amend column 13 of the Nikahnama, which deals with the amount of dower, to avoid problems between a couple after marriage.
A division bench comprising Justice Mirza Viqas Rauf and Justice Raheel Kamran has been asked by the chief justice to decide a matter relating to questions whether columns 13 and 16 (relating to the dower) in the Nikahnama are to be read separately or in conjunction with each other or entries in the document can operate against a person not privy to it.
According to facts of the case, a house owned by a man had been mentioned as haq mehr in the Nikahnama of his son. The man was neither a signatory to the document nor had he given any consent for the transfer of the same in favour of his daughter-in-law, so she was precluded to claim the said house. The woman had approached the high court against an order of a sessions court.
In the verdict, the judges noted that column 13 exclusively dealt with the amount of dower whereas columns 14, 15 and 16 were in addition to column 13 in order to explain the nature of the dower, part of dower if paid at the time of marriage or the property in lieu of the dower.
The bench observed that marriage is a civil contract, which has for its object the procreation and the legalising of children and dower or “mehr” is the sum of money or other property which the wife is entitled to from the husband in consideration of the marriage.
It noted that if the property mentioned in the Nikahnama was not owned by the groom, but rather his father, mother or brother, who is neither a signatory to the Nikahnama nor had agreed to transfer the same in favour of the bride, entries in the Nikahnama could not be enforced against him/her and he/she cannot be deprived of his/her property.
The situation, however, would become different when on behalf of a groom his father, mother or any other person being owner of such property found mentioned in the Nikahnama became signatory to the document, he/she binds himself/herself to the terms and conditions and as such, he/she parts with the ownership rights of the property in favour of the bride.
The bench observed that the anomalies often occurred due to incompetence or wilful fault on the part of nikah registrars, who ordinarily avoided adherence to the rules. In order to avoid such problems in the future, the bench issued a directive to all nikah registrars to ensure compliance with rules while recording entries in the Nikahnama.
“They shall also avoid incorporating any entry other than allowed in Nikahnama and take special care while making entries in columns 13 to 16,” the bench added.
The bench has ordered the governments to amend column 13 in the Nikahnama form and categorise the dower as an amount in cash, moveable property and immovable property with specification.
The governments have also been directed to prescribe minimum educational qualification for the grant of licence to a nikah registrar in pursuance of the 1961 rules, and make arrangements for their proper training.
