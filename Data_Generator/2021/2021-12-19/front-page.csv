• Officials rule out possibility of sabotage
• CM orders thorough probe
KARACHI: Al least 15 people were killed and 16 others injured when a building housing a private bank in the Shershah area collapsed on Saturday due to a huge gas explosion in a nullah on which it was constructed, according to officials and witnesses.  
The death toll is feared to climb up, as doctors described the condition of six of the injured as serious. Among the deceased was father of the ruling party’s lawmaker Alamgir Khan, Dilawar Khan, while most of others who died were bank employees or clients. 
In a tweet, Prime Minister Imran Khan stated: “My heartfelt prayers & condolences go to all the families of victims of the twin blasts at Sher Shah Paracha Chowk, Karachi. I am especially saddened to hear of the loss of our MNA Alamgir Khan’s father who also perished in the blast. May Allah give him strength to bear this loss.” 
Officials have ruled out the possibility of any sabotage or terrorist act declaring that the explosion took place due to accumulation of gases in the sewerage line. However, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah directed the Karachi commissioner to conduct a thorough inquiry in consultation with police. 
The bank building, a nearby petrol pump and some vehicles were damaged in the explosion caused by accumulation of gases in the drain underneath, officials at the Site police station said. Subsequently, they said, contingents of police, bomb disposal unit and rescue workers rushed to the spot and started retrieving the bodies from under the debris. 
Dr Sabin Memon, head of Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Trauma Centre at Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi, said: “Fifteen people have died in the incident.” He said 16 injured were also brought for treatment. Eight of them were discharged after being provided first aid and an equal number of people were admitted for treatment. “Two of them have suffered life-threatening injuries and condition of four others is also relatively serious,” he said.  
The head of the trauma centre described fallen debris as the cause of death. He said no smell of chemical or explosive substance from the bodies was noticed. All the deceased and the injured were men, he added.  
Deceased, survivors identified 
Dr Qarar Ahmed Abbasi, Additional police surgeon at Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital, said that 13 people had been brought dead at the hospital and two died during treatment. He said the deceased were identified as Mirabat Khan, Dildar Khan, Zeeshan, Mohammed Yunis, Inamullah Shah, Shafiullah Khan, Zahid Husain, Junaid Zehri, Naseerullah Khan, Sooba Khan, Dilawar Khan, Rashid Khan, Islam Khowaja, Mohammed Shafiq and Altaf Idrees. Some of the injured were Ghulam Mustafa, Mohammed Arshad, Ghulam Akbar, Jameel Ahmed, Abdul Ghaffar, Hammad, Riaz Mehmood, Kashmir Khan and Abdul Wahab. 
In a statement, Karachi police spokesperson said the explosion took place due to accumulation of gases, ruling out possibility of any sabotage or terror act. The bomb disposal squad officials, who examined the blast site minutely, also confirmed to the authorities that it was a gas explosion. 
According to a BDS report reviewed by Dawn, the blast occurred inside the sewerage line at the private bank and petrol pump near Shershah’s Paracha Chowk. The bank offices and nearby showroom offices were badly damaged ‘due to sewerage line gas blast’, causing loss of human lives, according to the report. 
DIG (South) Sharjeel Kharal said police investigators had collected CCTV footage from the damaged building of the private bank and nearby place. Samples of the debris from the bank and the drain was also obtained and sent for a forensic analysis, he said, a proper investigation was under way. 
An Edhi Foundation spokesperson whose ambulances shifted the bodies to the hospital said that almost all the victims were either employees of the bank or customers. 
Area police officer Zafar Ali Shah recalled that a similar sewerage line explosion had claimed one life and damaged a restaurant in the same area some months ago. He recalled that a notice had been served to the bank to vacate the place, as it was situated on the drain. 
Minister for Information and Labour Saeed Ghani told the media that the bank building was constructed ‘illegally’ on the drain and rented out by the industrial association, SITE.

2,SC ruling to help retired judges join ECP earlier than two years,An upper age limit requirement has also been imposed: 68 years for the CEC and 65 for the members.,"ISLAMABAD: In a rare exercise of its power to “read in” the law, the Supreme Court has done away with constitutional bar on the appointment of retired judges as members of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) before completion of two years after their retirement.  
The court in a detailed order on a petition challenging the Sindh High Court’s judgement of June 12, 2020 validating appointment of three ECP members made in contravention of the constitutional bar held that since introduction of 22nd Amend­ment, the words “or member of the Election Commission” were to be read in into clause (2) of Article 207 of the Cons­titution after the term “Chief Election Commissioner”.  
Article 207 (2) in its present form reads: “A person who has held office as a Judge of the Supreme Court or of a High Court shall not hold any office of profit in the service of Pakistan, not being a judicial or quasi-judicial office or the office of Chief Election Commissioner or of Chairman or member of a law commission or of Chairman or member of the Council of Islamic Ideology, before the expiration of two years after he has ceased to hold that office.”  
The three-member bench which dismissed the appeal filed by retd Justice Wajihuddin Ahmed of Aam Log Ittehad compromised Justice Sajjad Baqir, Justice Sajjad Ali Shah and Justice Munib Akhtar. Justice Baqir wrote a note of dissent.  
Terming the exclusion of ECP members from the exemptions provided in the article as an unintended omission, the apex court in its majority decision said: “Having carefully considered the matter, we are of the view that the present case is an example of the clearest of cases where the intent behind the constitutional amendments is so obvious, and so patently requires appropriate action so as not to defeat the manifest objective thereof, that the constitutional rule of ‘reading in’ can and ought to be invoked in the narrow and limited sense…”.  
The bench pointed out that under the constitution there was room for appointment of both sitting and retired judge of the Supreme Court as chief election commissioner, but only serving judges of the high courts were to be appointed as members of the ECP.  
“The reason for the ‘failure’ to mention members of the commission in Article 207(2) becomes clear at once. They were not mentioned because there was no need to do so, the court noted. “Article 207(2) applied only to retired Judges. That situation could not, and did not, arise in respect of the members of the Commission on commencing day.”  
Referring to 22nd Amendment, the bench said it was now only retired officials (or technocrats) who can be appointed CEC or members of the commission.  
According to the judgement, an upper age limit requirement has also been imposed: 68 years for the CEC and 65 for the members. Insofar as the CEC is concerned, there is no change in the context of Article 207(2).  
However, in relation to ECP members being retired judges, if that provision were to apply a rather startling result would obtain. By virtue of the provision, no retired judge would be eligible for appointment for a period of two years, i.e., until he reaches the age of 64. But, by virtue of the upper age limit, a retired judge over 65 years would be ineligible.   
“Therefore, if the learned petitioner is correct, then there would only be a very narrow band within which retired judges would be eligible: the one-year period between the ages of 64 and 65. On the other hand, retired senior civil servants would be eligible from a five-year band, the ages of 60 (when civil servants retire) till 65. And for technocrats there would be only the upper age limit of 65.  
The practical result could well be that on most occasions that a vacancy arises for appointment of an ECP member, retired judges would simply be ineligible since it could well be that there are no judges within the one-year band at that time.  
“This could hardly have been the intent behind the constitutional amendment. On the other hand, if Article 207(2) were inapplicable, the pool of eligible Judges would be considerably greater, being those aged between 62 and 65. This would almost certainly ensure that for any vacancy at any given time a suitable pool of retired judges would be available for consideration for appointment. That would accord with the constitutional intent.”  
The court also held that the ECP was an administrative and not a judicial or quasi-judicial forum.  
Referring to the powers of the ECP in certain matters including disposal of appeals, as vested in a court under the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC), the verdict said the conferment of this sort of powers was a common legislative device that had been adopted in many statutes in respect of diverse offices, bodies, authorities and forums.  
“To take but one example, s. 176 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 (“2001 Ordinance”) empowers the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to issue notices to persons to attend to tax (and/or other) authorities, and provide information and produce record etc. Subsection (4) of this section corresponds to s. 126. It lists very much the same sort of matters in respect of which the Commissioner can exercise the powers of a court under the CPC. No one has ever suggested that the Commissioner, by virtue of section 176(4), is to be regarded as being an office or post of a quasi- judicial nature.  
Remaining with fiscal laws for the moment, we may also note that such laws routinely provide that for purposes of recovery of tax, the relevant authorities shall have the same powers as does a court under the CPC for the purposes of the recovery of any amount due under a decree, like Section 138 of the 2001 Ordinance, Section 202 of the Customs Act, 1969 and Section 48 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990.  
“Again, no one has ever suggested that by reason of such a provision the tax authorities are to be regarded as quasi-judicial. Section 126 is just another example of a well-known, and widely used legislative device and nothing more should be read into it”, the judgment reads.  
Three out of the four members of the ECP had been appointed in 2016 in contravention of the constitutional provision that bars re-employment of judges of the superior judiciary within two years of their retirement.

3,Alarm over rupee devaluation in Dubai,Remittances from Pakistanis living in Dubai have been on the wane since July amid growing hawala use.,"KARACHI: Hawala operators in Dubai are selling the dollar for Rs187-89 (at a premium of three to four per cent compared to rates in Pakistan), resulting in a decline in the official remittances from Pakistanis working in the United Arab Emirates.  
In Pakistan, the dollar was trading at around Rs181 in the open market compared to Rs178 in the inter-bank market on Friday.   
Local exchange companies say the dollar rate in Dubai is considered the real value of the currency in Pakistan, particularly in the open market.

The open market usually sells the greenback at Rs2-3 higher than the inter-bank market. 

Local dealers link drop in remittances from UAE to rise in hawala

“There is a big gap in dollar prices in Dubai and Pakistan. Dubai-based hawala operators have been selling the US currency at Rs187-89, attracting a lot of Pakistanis to remit their income through the system,” said Zafar Paracha, the general secretary of the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan.  
He said the Pakistani market could consider the exchange rate as the real one, which may lead to further devaluation of the rupee.  
The State Bank could not be reached for comment.  
Hawala money transfer businesses work under a system that allows customers to rapidly move large sums across borders outside the scrutiny of regulators.  
The trust-based money transfer system has long been the banking system of choice for many people in Pakistan, but many businesses are unregulated and once the money has left the country it is hard to keep track of it. 
Worryingly for the government, remittances from Pakistanis living in Dubai have been on the wane since July amid growing hawala use.  
Official data shows that remittance from Dubai stood at $530.6m in July, $512.3m in August, $502m in September, $455.9m in October, and $452.5m in November. 
One reason behind an expensive dollar in Dubai is that people from Afghanistan and some Central Asian countries are paying Pakistani exporters in dollars purchased from hawala operators. 
Pakistani exporters buying goods for an Afghan importer have to deposit the entire amount of dollars equal to the exportable goods in a Pakistani bank. The exporters buy dollars from the local currency market, which is cheaper than Dubai, and deposit in a Pakistani bank. 
In fact, Afghanis are making their payments to Pakistani exporters in rupees at the rate of Rs187-189 instead of dollars.  
“Afghanistan and Central Asian countries have been doing it because they have no dollars,” said Malik Bostan, the chairman of the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan. 
He said he has recently briefed the high-ups in the government, including Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance and Revenue Shaukat Tarin, about the alarming situation since the illegal system of transactions is getting stronger. 
“Previously, we used to buy foreign currencies equal to $10 to $12 million daily, but it has now shrunk to just $3-4m. These currencies are officially taken to Dubai to bring back the dollar equal to the value of foreign currencies,” he said, adding that it has deprived the country of a reasonable amount of the US currency. 
“I have alarmed the authorities that if this isn’t stopped, the country may lose up to $2 billion in remittances in the near future,” Mr Bostan said.

4,"Judges are not exempt from criticism, holds IHC","The independence of a judge is not affected in any manner because of public criticism, IHC CJ observes.","ISLAMABAD: The judiciary, due to its lofty position in society, is open to criticism and “a judge is not immune from being criticised”, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) chief justice has observed in a detailed order on the post-arrest bail plea of a local politician. 
IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah had on Dec 16 granted post-arrest bail to the local leader of the Pakistan Peoples Party, Masoodur Rehman Abbasi, who had been behind bars since June for criticising Chief Justice of Pakistan Gulzar Ahmed. 
Read: PPP leader says he was not in his ‘senses’ during his outburst against CJP
According to the detailed order on Saturday, “the judicial branch of the state has a pivotal role in the society. A judge is not immune from being criticised. The judiciary, because of the nature of functions assigned to it under the constitution and the lofty position it enjoys in the society, is open to criticism.” 
The IHC observed that the independence of a judge was not affected in any manner because of public criticism. “But unthoughtful criticism, using strong and intemperate language or utterances that are defamatory in nature, ought to be avoided,” the court advised. 
The Federal Investigation Agency had booked and arrested the PPP leader on a complaint of Mohammad Sohail Sajid registered at the FIA’s cyber crime circle police station in Islamabad under various sections of Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 and the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016 (Peca). 
The case was registered on the basis of footage of a portion of a recorded speech that had been uploaded and circulated on the social media. The transcript of the speech, reproduced in the FIR, explains how Mr Abbasi had criticised the Chief Justice of Pakistan using strong and undesirable language. 
The court observed in the order: “Prima facie, some portions appear to be defamatory while the language used was indeed not temperate.” 
However, it was not the case of the FIA that Abbasi was involved in uploading the footage of the recorded speech on social media platforms, he had intentionally and publically exhibited, displayed or transmitted any information through any information system, knowing it to be false or to harm the repute of the complainant, the court order noted. 
When the IHC asked FIA investigation officer Mohammad Ayaz to justify how, in the facts and circumstances of the case in hand, the offences mentioned in the FIR were attracted, he was unable to give any plausible explanation rather conceded that some sections could have not been invoked. 
The FIA also remained unable to explain the locus standi of the complainant to file a complaint on behalf of the former CJP. There was nothing on record to show that Mr Abbasi might have said something against the complainant to justify registration of a criminal case under person-specific offences relating to defamation or causing harm to a natural person’s reputation, the court noted. 
“Nonetheless, it is definitely a case of further inquiry,” Chief Justice Minallah remarked. 
“It cannot be ruled out that the Agency may have been influenced by utterances made against the holder of the highest judicial officer of the country because the registration of the case, prima facie, appears to be an abuse of the offences under the [Peca] Act of 2016,” the court order stated. 
As per the decision, the allegations in the case in hand were in the context of ‘objectionable’ and ‘strong language’ used by Mr Abbasi against the holder of the highest judicial office i.e. the CJP. 
While granting post-arrest bail to him against Rs5,000 surety bonds, Justice Minallah cited the bail order in the case of “Mohammad Shafique Butt and another vs. The State” accused of displaying defamatory banners against the then sitting judge of Supreme Court, Justice Jawwad S. Khawaja. The relevant portions of the judgment are “Any perception of impartiality or bias, even if not a reality, would certainly prejudice the right to a free trial of any accused. Confidence in the court and assurance of a fair trial is a prerequisite for the dispensation of justice, and pivotal for creating public confidence and trust in the judiciary.” 
It observed that an independent judge, despite the harshness or tone of the criticism, could not be provoked to react in such a manner that results in their becoming the subject matter of a criminal case because of the profound consequences in the context of due process and fair trial.
