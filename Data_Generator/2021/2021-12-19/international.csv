0,Europeans reimpose restrictions as Omicron sweeps continent,"France, Cyprus and Austria have tightened travel restrictions.","LONDON: Nations across Europe are moving to reimpose tougher measures to stem a new wave of Covid-19 infections spurred by the highly transmissible omicron variant, triggering calls for protests from Paris to Barcelona.
As case numbers escalated, alarmed ministers in France, Cyprus and Austria tightened travel restrictions. Paris canceled its New Year’s Eve fireworks. Denmark closed theaters, concert halls, amusement parks and museums. Ireland imposed an 8pm curfew on pubs and bars and limited attendance at indoor and outdoor events.
London Mayor Sadiq Khan underscored the official concern about the climbing cases and their potential to overwhelm the health care system by declaring a major incident on Saturday, a move that allows local councils in Britain’s capital to coordinate work more closely with emergency services.
Irish Prime Minister Michel Martin captured the sense of the continent in an address to the nation, saying the new restrictions were needed to protect lives and livelihoods from the resurgent virus.
""None of this is easy,"" Martin said on Friday night. ""We are all exhausted with Covid and the restrictions it requires. The twists and turns, the disappointments and the frustrations take a heavy toll on everyone. But it is the reality that we are dealing with.""
The World Health Organisation reported on Saturday that the omicron variant of the coronavirus has been detected in 89 countries, and Covid-19 cases involving the variant are doubling every 1.5 to 3 days in places with community transmission and not just infections acquired abroad.
Major questions about omicron remain unanswered, including how effective existing Covid-19 vaccines are against it and whether the variant produces severe illness in many infected individuals, WHO noted.
Yet omicrons substantial growth advantage over the delta variant means it is likely to soon overtake delta as the dominant form of the virus in countries where the new variant is spreading locally, the UN health agency said.
Dutch government ministers were meeting on Saturday to discuss advice from a panel of experts who are recommending a toughening of the partial lockdown that is already in place and has led to a recent decline in infections.
Dutch Health Minister Hugo de Jonge didn’t say what measures the government might impose as he headed into the meeting. There are very serious concerns, he told reporters in The Hague. That’s why were meeting on Saturday to see what we need to do.
Some stores opened earlier than usual Saturday and shoppers flocked into city center shopping areas, fearing it could be their last chance to shop before Christmas.
Rotterdam municipality tweeted that it was too busy in the center of the port city and told people: Dont come to the city. 
Amsterdam also warned that the city’s main shopping street was busy and urged people to stick to coronavirus rules.

1,Germany warns Russia over Nord Stream ‘consequences’,The new German government has threatened to block the gas pipeline from operating if Russia invades Ukraine.,"BERLIN: German Economic Affairs Minister Robert Habeck warned in an interview published on Saturday of  “severe consequences” for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany if Moscow attacked Ukraine.
The Baltic Sea pipeline is set to double supplies of cheap natural gas from Russia to Germany, which the European Union’s top economy says is needed to help it transition from coal and nuclear energy.
But the 10-billion-euro ($12 billion) project has for years been dogged by delays and drawn fierce criticism from Germany’s eastern EU allies like Poland and from the United States.
Critics say the project will increase Europe’s dependence on Russian gas and Ukraine has described it as a  “geopolitical weapon”.
“Any new military action cannot remain without severe consequences,” the Green minister told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, a Sunday weekly, referring to a Russian troop deployment on the Ukraine border.
He warned that  “nothing can be excluded” if  “there is a new violation of the territorial integrity” of Ukraine.
The new German government threatened to block the pipeline from operating if Russia invades Ukraine.
“In the event of further escalation this gas pipeline could not come into service,” Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said.
Habeck said:  “From a geopolitical point of view, the pipeline is a mistake,” adding:  “All the countries were against it except Germany and Austria”.
He added:  “The pipeline has however been built. And the question of it being put into service remains open and must be decided according to European and German law.” German authorities are waiting for the pipeline’s Swiss-based  “Nord Stream 2 AG” operating company to submit documents to restart the certification process.
The pipeline would then also have to be approved by the European Commission — a process not likely to be completed in the first half of next year.

2,Taliban govt resumes issuing Afghan passports in Kabul,Thousands of Afghans have applied for new travel documents to escape a growing economic and humanitarian crisis.,"KABUL: Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities said on Saturday they will resume issuing passports in Kabul, giving hope to citizens who feel threatened living under their rule.
Thousands of Afghans have applied for new travel documents to escape a growing economic as well as a humanitarian crisis described by the United Nations as an  “avalanche of hunger”.
Authorities will start issuing the documents from Sunday at Kabul’s passport office, Alam Gul Haqqani, the head of the passport department in the interior ministry, told reporters.
The Taliban stopped issuing passports shortly after their August 15 return to power, as tens of thousands of people scrambled to Kabul’s only airport in a bid to catch any international flight that could evacuate them.
In October, authorities reopened the passport office in Kabul only to suspend work days later as a flood of applications caused the biometric equipment to break down.
“All the technical issues have now been resolved,” Haqqani said, adding that initially travel documents will be given to those who had already applied before the office suspended work. New applications will be accepted from January 10.
Many Afghans who wanted to visit neighbouring Pakistan for medical treatment have also been blocked in the absence of valid passports.
“My mother has some health issues and we needed to go to Pakistan a long time ago, but we could not because the passport department was closed,” said Jamshid, who like many Afghans goes by only one name.
“We are happy now ... we can get our passports and go to Pakistan,” he said as many began gathering outside the passport office after Saturday’s announcement.
Issuing passports — and allowing people to leave amid the growing humanitarian crisis — is seen as a test of the Taliban’s commitment to the international community.
The Taliban are pressing donors to restore billions of dollars in aid that was suspended when the previous Western-backed regime imploded in the final stages of a US military withdrawal.
The abrupt withholding of aid has amounted to an  “unprecedented” fiscal shock for an economy already battered by drought and decades of war, according to the United Nations Development Programme.
The crisis has forced many to sell household possessions to buy food.
On Saturday, the Taliban government’s deputy foreign minister Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanekzai urged aid agencies to apply pressure for the release of nearly $10 billion worth of assets held in the United States.
Stanekzai also urged all Afghan refugees to return now that the war had ended.
“We invite and encourage everyone to return to Afghanistan, even our political opponents,” he said at a function held to mark International Migrants Day.
Afghanistan’s minister for refugees Khalil Haqqani said that humanitarian organisations must help Afghan refugees return home.
“Afghan refugees living in camps abroad are in a bad situation. They have to return to Afghanistan and work here,” said Haqqani, who is a member of the Haqqani network, which was branded a terror group by Washington.
Over the past four decades, more than six million Afghans have fled the country to escape war and economic crises, most of them living in neighbouring Iran and Pakistan.
The international community has so far not recognised the current Taliban government that was formed after the chaotic withdrawal of US-led foreign troops.
International flights, mainly to Dubai and Abu Dhabi, have meanwhile slowly resumed at Kabul airport after the facility was trashed in August when crowds of people scrambled to evacuate.

3,Russia sends nuclear-capable bombers on patrol over Belarus,MOSCOW: A pair of nuclear-capable Russian long-range bombers patrolled the skies over Belarus on Saturday on a...,"MOSCOW: A pair of nuclear-capable Russian long-range bombers patrolled the skies over Belarus on Saturday on a mission intended to underline close defence ties between the two allies amid tensions with the West.
The Russian defence ministry said two Tu-22M3 flew a four-hour mission to practice performing joint tasks with the Belarusian air force and air defence. The bombers were escorted by Belarus’ Su-30 fighter jets, which Russia has supplied to its ally.
Saturday’s Russian bomber patrol marked a third such mission since last month.
The patrol flight comes amid Western concerns over a Russian troop buildup near Ukraine that raised fears of an invasion. Moscow has denied plans for such an attack, but urged the West to provide security guarantees that would exclude Nato’s expansion to Ukraine and the deployment of the alliance’s weapons there demands that are almost certain to be rejected by the US and its allies.
Some Ukrainian officials have voiced concern that Russia may use the territory of its ally Belarus for attacking Ukraine.
Moscow has strongly supported Belarus amid a tense standoff last month when thousands of migrants and refugees, most of them from the Middle East, gathered on the Belarusian side of the border with Poland in the hope of crossing into Western Europe.
The European Union has accused authoritarian Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko of encouraging illegal border crossings as a hybrid attack to retaliate against EU sanctions on his government for its crackdown on internal dissent after Lukashenkos disputed 2020 reelection.
Amid tensions with the West, Lukashenko said last month that his country would be ready to host Russian nuclear weapons.
The Belarusian leader wouldn’t elaborate on what kind of weapons Belarus would be willing to accommodate, but noted that the ex-Soviet nation has carefully preserved the necessary military infrastructure dating back to the time of the USSR.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has described Lukashenkos offer as a serious warning prompted by reckless Western policy.The deputy foreign minister Sergei  Ryabkov said that Russia’s relations with the United  States have not hit their lowest point yet and security proposals  Moscow has made can help ease tensions.
Russia said it wanted a legally binding guarantee that Nato would give up  any military activity in Eastern Europe and Ukraine, part of a wish  list of security guarantees it wants to negotiate with the West.
It  laid out for the first time in detail demands that it says are  essential for lowering tensions in Europe and defusing a crisis over  Ukraine.
“I think we did not hit the lowest point, thank God, and  there is a progress in some aspects at the very least and not everything  is hopeless,” Interfax news agency quoted Ryabkov as saying on  Saturday.
Moscow needs stable and predictable relations with Washington, he said.
“The  situation can be stabilised and improved with the help of such  agreements. Without them the situation will remain extremely difficult  and tense,” Ryabkov said, according to Interfax.
The Russian  proposals were set out in two documents this week — a draft agreement  with Nato countries and a draft treaty with the United States, both  published by the foreign ministry.

4,Catalans protest against mandate for more Spanish in schools,The court decision mandates that 25pc of all school subjects be taught in Spanish.,"BARCELONA: Thousands of Catalans took to the streets of Barcelona on Saturday to protest against a court decision that mandates that 25pc of all school subjects be taught in Spanish, reducing the still predominant use of the local Catalan language in classrooms.
Demonstrators say this would threaten their cherished educational system, which has helped bring Catalan back to common use after it had been suppressed during the 20th-century dictatorship of Gen Francisco Franco.
It is not proper of a democracy that a court invalidates an educational system that is supported by society and its parliament, said scar Escuder, president of Platform for the Language, a grassroots group that promotes the use of Catalan who joined the march. According to our polls, 82pc of Catalans support the current system.
The renewed defence of the Catalan language also promises to galvanise the region’s separatist movement that has been struggling to maintain its unity. Several marchers carried pro-independence flags, and the movement’s leaders were in attendance. 
But families who want their children to receive more learning in Spanish say the current system is violating their rights to study in the nations common tongue.
The march comes less than a month since Spain’s Supreme Court upheld the 2020 decision by a lower court in Catalonia that ruled in favour on a suit brought by the Spain’s previous conservative government against Catalonia’s Department of Education.
The Supreme Court tossed out an appeal by the Catalan government against the previous ruling that the region’s schools must guarantee at least 25pc of academic subjects be taught in Spanish. That would translate into roughly doubling the hours Catalan student are taught in Spanish from one subject to two. Currently, most schools only use Spanish in Spanish language class, leaving everything else to be taught in Catalan.

5,US lawmakers call for help to rebuild Afghan economy,The letter is addressed to State Secretary Antony Blinken and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.,"WASHINGTON: Nine senior US lawmakers sent a letter to secretaries of state and treasury on Saturday, asking them to help rebuild Afghanistan’s failing economy and to unfreeze the country’s assets.
The appeal coincides with an OIC foreign ministers’ conference in Islamabad on Sunday to consider options for helping Afghanistan and to urge the Taliban to soften their policies. The United States and other Western nations have refused to deal with the Taliban government until it changes its policies.
The US is also attending the meeting and has sent its special envoy for Afghanistan, Thomas West, to Islamabad. In a tweet posted on Saturday, Ambassador West noted that this “extraordinary session” of the OIC foreign ministers “focused on” the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan and described Pakistan’s decision to call the meeting as an “important initiative”.

 



 
This is an “approach the US can take to help prevent a catastrophic collapse of Afghanistan’s aid-dependent economy while not providing legitimacy to the Taliban,” the nine lawmakers wrote.
The letter is addressed to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and the signatories include the heads of three powerful House committees.
The lawmakers reminded the administration that they had the “responsibility to help the many million more who will stay to survive the winter, to feed their children, and to preserve what can be salvaged from the progress made during the last 20 years”.
Referring to a recent World Food Programme (WFP) report, the lawmakers pointed out that Afghanistan “is on the brink of economic collapse” as more than 18.4 million Afghans needed humanitarian assistance while 30 per cent of the population faced emergency or crisis-level food insecurity.
The letter includes four proposals: Releasing frozen Afghan assets of more than $9 billion to an appropriate UN agency, expanding sanction exemptions for international organisations dealing with Afghanistan, assisting multilateral organisations to pay salaries of essential workers, and allowing international financial institutions to “inject the necessary economic capital into Afghanistan to stave off the economic meltdown”.

6,Israeli police detain Palestinian woman accused of stabbing settler,RAMALLAH: A Palestinian woman was detained after she stabbed and lightly wounded a Jewish settler in the occupied...,"RAMALLAH: A Palestinian woman was detained after she stabbed and lightly wounded a Jewish settler in the occupied West Bank on Saturday, police said, following two days of violence across the territory.
In a statement, the Israeli border police said officers arrested a 65-year-old Palestinian woman after she stabbed and wrestled with the 38-year-old settler in the centre of the highly contested city of Hebron. Officers managed to detain the woman without firing rounds and took her away for questioning, police said.
There has been no immediate Palestinian comment on the incident.
The incident took place at a checkpoint near the burial site of religious patriarch Abraham, known to Jews as the Tomb of the Patriarchs and Muslims as the Ibrahimi Mosque. Hebron is the West Bank’s largest city and is a frequent flashpoint between settlers and Palestinians.
The city is home to more than 200,000 Palestinians as well as several hundred ultranationalist and radical Jewish settlers who live in the city’s downtown area in heavily fortified enclaves protected by the military.
Saturdays stabbing comes amid a weekend of Israeli-Palestinian violence across the West Bank.
On Thursday evening, Jewish settler Yehuda Dimentman was shot dead by Palestinian gunmen near an abandoned settlement outpost, igniting a string of settler retaliation attacks on Friday that left two Palestinians with moderate injuries.
Thursdays shooting took place near Homesh, a former settlement evacuated as part of Israels withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in 2005. In recent years, settlers have re-established an unauthorised outpost at the site, one of dozens of outposts in the West Bank that are considered illegal but often tolerated by the Israeli government.
Israeli leaders have vowed to find the assailants responsible for the killing and have deployed a large number of troops across the northern West Bank. According to the official Palestinian news agency, Wafa, Israeli troops have cordoned off roads between the northern West Bank cities of Nablus and Jenin on Saturday morning and are conducting searches in nearby villages.
Past months have seen an increase in stabbing attacks against Israeli citizens.

7,One-year-old migrant crossed Mediterranean sea alone: report,The child is among 500-plus people who arrived on the small island of Lampedusa.,"ROME: A one-year-old boy believed to have been sent by his parents to make the dangerous Mediterranean crossing alone has made it safely to the island of Lampedusa, Italian media reports said on Saturday.
The child, estimated to be barely a year old, was among 500-plus people who arrived on the small island in seven separate landings over the past two days, the Repubblica daily said.
He was spotted by rescuers in the midst of some 70 men in a boat which landed on Friday, the daily said. “He crossed the Mediterranean before he even learned to walk. He braved the waves alone... too young to reveal his name and his story,” it said.
The other migrants had no idea who the child was, but were reportedly begged by his parents to keep him safe during the crossing, possibly because they were prevented from boarding with him, the daily said. Another arrival was a 14-year-old son of a woman who died during a rescue off the island.
“She was travelling on a boat with 25 other people, including her son who saw her drown,” Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said on Twitter. “Another preventable loss on Europe’s doorstep, another life claimed by irresponsible migration policies”.

 



 
Some 1,340 people have died attempting the perilous Central Mediterranean crossing so far this year, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM).

The musician had given lessons to minors, though there was no evidence of abuse, police said.
