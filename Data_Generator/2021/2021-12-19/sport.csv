0,Rahul appointed vice-captain as India eye first Test series triumph in SA,MUMBAI: Indian opener KL Rahul has been named vice-captain for the three-Test series against South Africa after ...,"MUMBAI: Indian opener KL Rahul has been named vice-captain for the three-Test series against South Africa after Rohit Sharma was ruled out of the tour due to injury, the country’s cricket board (BCCI) said on Saturday.
The 29-year-old is returning to the Test side after missing the series win against New Zealand at home due to a muscle strain.
“The All-India Senior selection committee has named KL Rahul as vice-captain for the upcoming three-match Test series against South Africa. KL Rahul replaces Rohit Sharma as vice-captain, who was ruled out of the Test series owing to a hamstring injury,” the BCCI said in a statement.
Meanwhile, India batter Cheteshwar Pujara says  they are confident of claiming a historic first Test series win in South  Africa, led by their potent fast bowling attack on the lively Highveld  wickets where the first two of three Tests will be played.
India  are fresh from home success against New Zealand, while South Africa have  not played red ball cricket since June ahead of the first Test that  starts in Centurion on Dec 26.
“We have played a couple of Tests  in India, so most of the guys are in touch,” Pujara said on Saturday. “There is enough time  for us to prepare and the guys are really looking forward to these Tests. It is the best chance for us to finally win a series in South  Africa.”
Pujara believes the growing influence of India’s fast bowling  attack, which has led to success overseas in the recent past, gives them  confidence they can match the home side on what are usually  seamer-friendly wickets.
“Our fast bowlers have  been the difference between the sides overall when we have played  abroad. If you look at the Australia and England series, we have done  exceptionally well as a bowling unit.

1,Premier League loses another game to Covid outbreak,"League approves Aston Villa’s request to postpone match against Burnley based on number of Covid-19 cases, injuries and illness.","LONDON: The Premier League lost another match to a Covid-19 outbreak in a squad when Aston Villa’s home game against Burnley was postponed around two hours before kickoff on Saturday.
Villa said it did not have enough players to field a team following more positive tests in its squad that were reported early Saturday. The league approved Villa’s request to postpone the match based on the number of Covid-19 cases, injuries and illness. 
“After reviewing all the new information provided by Aston Villa this morning and receiving separate medical advice, the Board approved the request as a result of the club not having enough players to field a team,” the league said. “This decision was based on the number of Covid-19 cases, injuries and illness.” 
Neither the Premier League nor Villa provided details on how many players had tested positive. 
“The results of PCR tests, which were taken yesterday prior to training as well as Lateral Flow Tests, were received this morning and confirmed further depletion of our playing squad which was already impacted upon for our trip to Norwich in midweek,” said Villa, who won that game 2-0. 
“All individuals who tested positive are now isolating in line with Premier League and government guidance and protocols. The Club is extremely sorry for the inconvenience caused to Burnley Football Club, both our own supporters and the Burnley fans due to attend the fixture, but have acted as swiftly as possible this morning to minimise disruption.” 
Burnley had seen their home match against Watford on Wednesday called off at similar short notice after positive test results emerged in the visitors’ squad. 
Tony Scholes, communication officer for Burnley FC Supporters Groups, one of hundreds of fans who had travelled to the game, questioned the lack of consideration for supporters. 
“While aware of the current crisis, to have two games called off at such short notice within days of each other really is unacceptable. So many supporters are being inconvenienced without it seems any real concern from the clubs and the league,” he said. 
Five matches scheduled for this weekend had already been called off because of coronavirus outbreaks in squads amid a worsening health emergency in Britain as the Omicron variant spreads. 
The league said the remaining four games Leeds United-Arsenal on Saturday and Newcastle United-Manchester City, Wolverhampton Wanderers-Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur-Liverpool on Sunday are currently scheduled to proceed as planned. 
The total number of Premier League games to have been postponed over the past week stands at 10. Only six games were called off in the whole of last season because of the coronavirus. 
Premier League managers will meet on Monday to discuss the Covid-19 situation and what action to take, with a busy schedule of matches over the Christmas and New Year period. 
Some managers have voiced concerns over potential harm to the integrity of the competition, with teams deprived of key players and some training grounds closed. 
Brentford boss Thomas Frank this week called for a suspension of matches to “break the chain” of infection while Liverpool’s Jurgen Klopp said it could soon become impossible to maintain the schedule as squads became over-stretched by Covid absences and injuries. 
The Premier League’s position has been that games will continue when it is safe to stage them. 
The English Football League, which comprises the three divisions below the Premier League, has also been hit by a swathe of postponements with 19 of its 36 games called off due to coronavirus.

World number one and Wimbledon champion Barty was runner-up in the last two editions of the Sydney International in 2018 and 2019 before the 134-year-old tournament fell victim to the reorganisation of the Australian season.
Barty will return to the harbour city for the Sydney Tennis Classic from Jan 9 to 15 at the head of a strong field which includes 19 of the world’s 24 best women players.
The Australian will be joined by top-10 players Garbine Muguruza, Barbora Krejcikova, Maria Sakkari, Anett Kontaveit, Paula Badosa, Iga Swiatek and Ons Jabeur in vying for the WTA 500 title.
British teenager Raducanu and Leylah Fernandez, the Canadian she beat in the final to complete her fairytale run to the US Open title earlier this year, will also be in action at the Sydney Olympic Park Tennis Centre.
Former US Open champion Dominic Thiem will be the main drawcard in the ATP tournament along with Australian Alex de Minaur, who was the last men’s Sydney International champion in 2019.
Barty will also play at the Adelaide International as she prepares for her home Grand Slam at Melbourne Park, which starts on Jan 17.

Churchill, who completed the frame in his last outing on Nov 20, obliged all and sundry to win in a start-to-finish bid among five contestants. Filly Princess Maria, who was on course for a hat-trick, seized third place another seven lengths behind followed by dark bay colt Young Gun.

Public fancy filly Chile also justified her credentials imposing to three lengths victory over bay horse Kuwait Edition to win the sixth and supporting race. Bay horse Piyara Faisal and filly Jugni followed the two in same order.
At the outset, another favourite bay horse Shan-e-Sikandar was on song when he got the better of mare Sheba by four-and-a-half lengths to set the winning trend.
With a win already under his belt, co-favourite chestnut horse Faris repeated his feat when he defeated Fair Deal hands down by ten lengths to clinch the third race.
The day saw two upsets in which rank outsiders Little Darling and Faster Than You lowered the colours of favourites to clinch honours.
Riders Safdar Hussain and Manzoor excelled in their cadre by partnering a brace of winners apiece while trainer Shabbir also finished with a double.

The veteran striker, who missed one game because of suspension and another because of injury, set up attack partner Santi Mina to open the scoring three minutes after kickoff.
Aspas doubled the advantage two minutes after halftime when he curled a shot around two defenders and goalkeeper Diego Lopez before the ball went in off the post. That was Aspas’s eighth goal of the season.
Substitute Denis Suarez added a third goal in the 82nd minute after Aspas started a counterattack before playing the ball wide for Hugo Mallo to assist Suarez.
Loren Moron lobbed in Espanyol’s only goal with an audacious strike from near the midfield line in stoppage time that caught goalie Matias Dituro out of position. 
The second home victory this season by Eduardo Coudet’s side at Balaidos Stadium lifted them into 12th place.
Ninth-placed Espanyol, which is very strong at home this season, remained winless in all nine trips from Barcelona.

8,Ponting questions Woakes’ selection over Wood,ADELAIDE: Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting has questioned England’s decision to select Chris Woakes ahead ...,"ADELAIDE: Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting has questioned England’s decision to select Chris Woakes ahead of Mark Wood for the ongoing second Ashes Test at the Adelaide Oval.
Woakes claimed one wicket for 103 runs in 23.4 first innings over as Australia took command of the Test, with the home side looking to build on their opening win of the series in Brisbane.
Ponting said the inclusion of Woakes over Wood, who played in the first Test, has had a detrimental impact on the influence of England all-rounder Ben Stokes.
“It looked to me as if Stokes was given one job, to run in and bowl bouncers ball after ball,” Ponting told cricket.com.au.
“When he finally got the chance to bowl at a new batsman and pitch the ball, he got a wicket second ball to [Cameron] Green.
“Woakes was ineffective again I’m not sure why they bothered picking him in Adelaide when they’ve got Wood there.
“To me Wood would have given them a lot more variation in their attack and then Stokes could have pitched it up and bowled like a normal seamer, which he’s good at, and Wood could have taken the role Stokes had.”
Ponting criticised the limited approach taken by England captain Joe Root and his bowling attack.
“Apart from the short-ball plan Stokes executed [on the first day], England didn’t seem to have much of a plan after that,” Ponting said.
“It was run in and bowl back-of-a-length and wait for the Aussies to make mistakes.
“Well, when you’re bowling to two of the top three batsmen in the world, they’re not going to make mistakes. You’ve got to find a way to get them out and change things up,” Ponting remarked.

Man-of-the-match Afraz’s 24th-minute goal cancelled out Kim Kyu-beom’s opener for South Korea 10 minutes earlier before Wahid put Pakistan in front in the 33rd. 
The Koreans, however, regained the lead with goals by Ji Woo-Cheon in the 42nd and Jang Jong-hyun in the 56th, only for Wahid to secure a point for Pakistan. 
Without a win in their first three matches, Pakistan remain fourth in the standings and in the final semi-final spot with two points, ahead of pointless Bangladesh, who are in fifth and were hammered 5-0 by Japan in the day’s other game. 
Pakistan face Bangladesh in the final round of games on Sunday and a draw will be enough to secure a semi-final berth.  
India, who have seven points, will finish top of the league standings regardless of the result against third-placed Japan in Sunday’s other match. 
Japan are only ahead of Pakistan on goal difference and results in the final round could see Pakistan finish in third place.  
South Korea have already secured second place with six points from their four games.

10,England crumble again to give Aussies complete control,Hostile pace from Mitchell Starc and Nathan Lyon’s dangerous spin did the damage to England.,"ADELAIDE: England were staring down the barrel of another sorry defeat on Saturday, dismissed for 236 then forced to watch as Australia batted again and stretched their lead in the day-night second Ashes Test in Adelaide.
Joe Root and Dawid Malan had survived the opening session of day three unscathed, building a 128-run stand as they chased Australia’s imposing first-innings 473 for nine declared.
But it all came crashing down after the dinner break with both players removed in quick succession, Root for 62 and Malan for 80, sparking a collapse that saw England slump from 150 for two to 236 all out.
Making matters worse, they did so against a second-string attack with Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood both missing.
Stand-in Australian skipper Steve Smith could have enforced the follow-on, but chose to rest his bowlers and send in the openers to turn the screw with two days left.
They negotiated some 75 minutes for the loss of David Warner for 13, needlessly run out after a disastrous mix-up with Marcus Harris, who remains unbeaten on 21.
Nightwatchman Michael Neser was on two as Australia reached 45 for one, building their lead to 282.
Hostile pace from Mitchell Starc and Nathan Lyon’s dangerous spin did the damage to England, complemented by Cameron Green, who bagged Root for the second consecutive time.
Starc claimed 4-37 and Lyon 3-58.
No bowler enjoys using the pink ball as much as the left-armer Starc. His record now  stands at 50 wickets 18 ahead of next-best Josh Hazlewood at an average  of 18.10 in day-night Tests.
“We’ve got a bit of a luxury of having  played eight Tests and [six] have been here,” Starc said. “I don’t think  Ive nailed it. But we’ve all got a certain plan to it.” 
Malan said Root and himself should have carried on.
“It’s pretty frustrating and disappointing — to lose two wickets like we did on Friday night, then get ourselves back into a position where we could get within touching distance of them,” said Malan. “Ultimately Rooty or myself should have gone on and got a big hundred.”
England crashed by nine wickets in the first Test at Brisbane and if they go 2-0 down in Adelaide the Ashes are as good as gone, needing to win all three remaining Tests.
Australia bowled repeat maidens at the start of the second session and Root looked increasingly uncomfortable against Green, who was starting to find movement with the pink ball.
Having passed 1,600 Test runs in a calendar year — only the fourth player in history to do so — Root poked at a Green delivery and got an edge to Smith at slip, leaving him still searching for an elusive first-ever century in Australia.
Malan soon followed, slashing at a Starc thunderbolt that took a nick, again into Smith’s safe hands. Malan has now scored nine Test 50s but only converted one into a century.
“We let it meander a little bit through the first session,” Starc said, while heaping praise on all-rounder Green.
“He’s a serious talent for a young kid, he’s a great addition to our bowling attack, he was extremely good in that session after the break.”
Starc added:  “We hold all the cards in terms of when we want to bowl and how big a lead we want to have, we’ve certainly got a few options on the table.”
Like in Brisbane, England’s batting folded. Ollie Pope survived a bat-pad review but only lasted two more balls, charging down the wicket to Lyon and edging to Marnus Labuschagne at short leg on five.
Jos Buttler fell without scoring to Starc and England trudged off to tea on 197 for six.
It didn’t take long for Australia to clean up the rest with Chris Woakes and Ollie Robinson also undone by Lyon, and when Ben Stokes was bowled by Green for 34, it was all but over.
England had resumed at 17 for two after losing openers Rory Burns (four) and Haseeb Hameed (six) to a fiery 40-minute spell from Starc, Neser and Jhye Richardson under lights on Friday evening.
Root strode out on five, alongside Malan on one.
They had perfect early batting conditions on a flat Adelaide pitch and Root settled, slamming a well-timed drive for four to boost his confidence.
Starc was hit for 11 off his first over and the pair quickly brought up their 50 partnership.
Malan completed his 50 with a single off Neser, while Root hit Richardson to the boundary to reach his 52nd half-century.

Ivan Perisic headed in the opener before Denzel Dumfries smashed in a second before the break, marking the first time in Inter’s history that they have reached 100 Serie A goals in a single calendar year.
Alexis Sanchez fired in a third before substitutes Lautaro Martinez and Roberto Gagliardini completed the rout to leave the hosts bottom of the table with eight points.
Inter are top with 43 points, four clear of AC Milan in second, who play Napoli on Sunday evening.
“We must continue like this, we are on a great run and we face Torino next,” Inzaghi added.
“It will be our ninth game in 25 games, we have to give one final push.”  The mood for the home fans at the Stadio Arechi was in sharp contrast to their visitors, as fans hung banners of protest after uncertainty over the clubs ownership situation led to reports that they could be expelled from Serie A mid-season.
Events on the pitch gave them little to cheer, either.
Perisic headed home from a corner and Dumfries cannoned a shot off the underside of the bar and in, with goal-line technology showing it had crossed the line after the ball bounced back out.
Inter’s pressure was relentless and they missed several good chances to add to their total.
The finest goal of the night was their third, as they started a counter-attack on the edge of their own box, which Sanchez eventually dispatched into the bottom corner after a slick series of passes.
Martinez and Gagliardini both benefited from the ball breaking to them in the area for their finishes inside the final 15 minutes as Inzaghi’s side showed their relentless side.
Earlier, Andriy Shevchenko’s nightmare start as Genoa coach continued as he suffered a 3-1 defeat by Lazio.
The Ukrainian has picked up one point from his first six league games in charge and his side are 19th with 10 points, while Lazio climbed to eighth with 28 points.

13,Lewandowski bags record as Bayern go nine points clear,BERLIN: Bayern Munich opened a nine-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga table on Friday with a 4-0 home win over...,"BERLIN: Bayern Munich opened a nine-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga table on Friday with a 4-0 home win over Wolfsburg as goal-scorers Robert Lewandowski, Thomas Mueller and Dayot Upamecano all celebrated milestones.
Mueller marked his 400th Bundesliga appearance by opening the scoring with his 222nd league goal before defender Upamecano, signed from Leipzig for this season, headed in his first goal in the famous red Bayern shirt.
Leroy Sane then planted a shot into the left corner on the hour mark.
Lewandowski, who on Tuesday equalled Gerd Mueller’s record of 42 German league goals in a calendar year from 1972, capped a gala night with Bayern’s fourth to claim the new record outright.
This was Bayern’s final match before the Bundesliga winter break and head coach Julian Nagelsmann was pleased with the performance.
“We defended well, pressed them hard, won pretty much every ball in our own half and we deserved to win by that margin,” said Nagelsmann.
The Bayern boss also praised Lewandowski’s latest record,  “he really deserves it, especially as he scored with his weaker foot”.
Bayern’s lead at the top of the Bundesliga table can be trimmed on Saturday by second-placed Borussia Dortmund, who are away to Hertha Berlin.
This was Wolfsburg’s seventh straight loss, piling the pressure on new head coach Florian Kohfeldt who only took charge at the end of October after the sacking of predecessor Mark van Bommel.
“That hurts - we defended badly, especially for the fourth goal, that wasn’t on,” fumed Kohfeldt who now has the two-week break to drill his team.
In contrast, this was Bayern’s seventh straight victory in all competitions.
Bayern were ahead after only seven minutes behind closed doors at the Allianz Arena when Serge Gnabry’s thunderbolt shot from distance was parried into the path of Mueller, who tapped home.
It stayed 1-0 at the break, but Mueller’s deft chip gave him a 15th assist in the Bundesliga this season as Upamecano steered his header into the net.
Just three minutes later, Sane grabbed Bayern’s third when he unleashed a superb shot which gave Wolfsburg goalkeeper Koen Casteels no chance.
Lewandowski finally got the goal to break another of Gerd Mueller’s records with some deadly finishing.
Before kick-off, Bayern sports director Hasan Salihamidzic ruled out any new signings in the forthcoming January transfer window.
“We are really well-staffed, that’s a fact,” he stressed,  “we will continue as things are this season.”
