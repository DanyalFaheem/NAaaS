2,"Islamabad, Rawalpindi shiver as temperature drops to -1°C","Met Office predicts no rain for the next three days, dry weather to continue.","RAWALPINDI: The cold weather that has gripped Rawalpindi and Islamabad for the last three days got bitter after the mercury dropped to -1°C Celsius on Saturday.
As a result, many areas of the twin cities faced low gas pressure with some having no gas at all. There were also complaints of citizens falling sick with cold-related ailments.
“The upper parts of the country, including Rawalpindi and Islamabad, will remain under the cold wave, with no chance of rain in the next three days,” a Meteorological Department official told Dawn.
“Continental air is prevailing over most parts of the country. Very cold and dry weather is expected in most upper/central parts of the country and north Balochistan. Plain areas of Punjab will see dense fog/smog,” he said.

Met Office predicts no rain in next three days, dry weather to continue

The official said the minimum temperature in Rawalpindi and Islamabad was recorded at zero degree Celsius in the last two days which dropped to -1°C on Saturday. 
It is not an unusual cold pattern as in December and January the twin cities witness a minimum temperature of -1 and -2°C.
“The lowest minimum temperature of -3.5°C was recorded in the twin cities on Jan 28, 1984,” he said, adding that due to global warming the weather pattern in the area was changing.
The official said Saturday’s -1°C was the lowest temperature recorded in the twin cities during the current season.
“Though clouds will appear in Rawalpindi and Islamabad on Sunday, there are no chances of rain in the next three days,” he added.
Meanwhile, living condition in the twin cities has become tougher as the residents are continuously facing low pressure of natural gas.
Most households have switched to alternatives, but it has created extra burden on their monthly budget. The price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) has increased to Rs240 per kg.
“Due to the biting cold, children and elderly people are getting fever and other cold ailments. Natural gas is not only needed to prepare food but also for heating purpose,” said Nosheen Ahmed, a resident of Media Town.
Mohammad Salman, a resident of Arya Mohallah, said the government increased electricity tariff and people had no other option but to use wood and coal.
He said the use of LPG cylinder was risky, but there was no choice as gas had vanished in the last one month.
The number of people complaining of cold-related ailments has also shot up in the last few days. Doctors say most of the patients were children and elderly persons.
“The number of elderly people visiting hospitals with complaints of high blood pressure has also increased. Children are also reporting to hospitals in large numbers with complaints of cough, cold and skin ailments,” said a doctor at the Holy Family Hospital.
According to doctors, people should increase intake of liquid, especially soup, and cover their heads and ears to beat the cold. On the other hand, the cold wave has increased the sale of winter dishes and other edibles. 
However, unlike the past years when stalls of traditional food items at Bhabara Bazaar, Saddar and Commercial Market pulled crowds, no such rush has been seen in these areas due to high prices.

7,Consumers want early enactment of rules for ICT Food Safety Act,ISLAMABAD: The Network for Consumer Protection has appealed to the federal government and the Islamabad Capital...,"ISLAMABAD: The Network for Consumer Protection has appealed to the federal government and the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) administration to enact rules of business for recently passed ICT Food Safety Act, saying this will help the inhabitants of Islamabad Capital Territory to be covered under the upgraded safer food regulations at par with provinces.
The ICT food Safety Act was passed by the joint session of the Parliament on Nov 17 this year after remaining under parliamentary review for over two years. The rules of business will make the much-needed law operational.
Since constitutional devolution in 2010, all provinces have enacted laws to establish food authorities. Now the Parliament has also replaced the 1960 pure food law with new legislation and extended safer food protection to consumers of the Islamabad metropolitan area.
According to a press release, this legislative measure was welcomed by The Network and GAIN (The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition), as part of their initiative to create enabling environment for nutritious and safe food in the Islamabad territory.
Expressing optimism, GAIN’s Senior Policy Adviser Faiz Rasool said this piece of legislation was a great initiative and would be a step forward towards the government efforts on ‘transforming Pakistan’s food systems’.
“Pakistan has one of the highest malnutrition burdens in the world. Diet is the number one risk factor in the burden of disease and is a central driver for all forms of malnutrition and many non-communicable diseases (NCD’s),” he said.
Mr Faiz Rasool also focused on the importance of safe and nutritious food. He emphasised the need for increased knowledge and awareness of the Pakistani population on creating a demand for healthy diets and dietary behaviours.
CEO of The Network Nadeem Iqbal said: “The recent passage of Islamabad Food Safety Act by the joint session of the parliament has brought forth new opportunities for the federal government to build required food safety infrastructure and institutions in the capital city so that people can consume safer food.”
The ICT food safety bill was stuck in the labyrinth of the Parliament since 2018, when two identical bills were simultaneously presented in the National Assembly and the Senate.

Citing the postmortem report, she said the ribs and right arm of her brother were found fractured. She said the police removed the CCTV camera from the house where they had kept the two persons.

She also said in the petition that after she nominated some high-profile police officials, an FIR was lodged against her under the Anti-Terrorism Act for abetting her ‘runaway’ brother.
It may be mentioned that in a statement recorded during the investigation, the complainant had also sought action against the then city police officer of Rawalpindi.

Justice Mohsin Akhter Kayani on Aug 2 set aside the report of the judicial magistrate and ordered him to proceed on the report supposed to be filed by the superintendent of police (SP).
However, during Friday’s proceedings the police stated that “SSP investigation Islamabad is suffering from Covid-19 whereas SP investigation Liaquat Hayat Khan Niazi has been transferred to the motorway police and no officer has been posted in his place.”
The police prosecution sought a two months’ time from the IHC. However, Justice Kayani directed them to complete the final report by January 25 and adjourned further hearing.
