1,Health dept to terminate MTI consultants as its employees,"They will be asked to work with the respective MTIs only in line with their employment contracts, officials say.","PESHAWAR: The health department has decided to terminate the services of the consultants of medical teaching institutions as its employees.
They will be asked to work with the respective MTIs only in line with their employment contracts, officials of the department told Dawn. They said many consultants violated the law by working with the health department and MTIs simultaneously as they were supposed to resign from government jobs after appointment to the teaching institutions.
The officials said the crackdown on dual jobs would begin from MTI Khyber Teaching Hospital, where 40 medical specialists had working as assistant professors, in addition to their jobs in other institutions directly managed by the health department.
When contacted, health secretary Mohammad Tahir Orakzai disclosed that the department had started work to identify such doctors for disciplinary action.

They will work with teaching institutions only, say officials

“After we receive the information and complaint against the Board of Governors (BoG), the health department will identify them for en bloc action as under the Medical Teaching Institutions Reforms Act, 2015, they cannot perform two jobs at the same time,” he told Dawn. He said under the law, the MTI employees had got service protection.
“We have to support the health system and benefit the people. The consultants hired by the health department or MTIs should work in accordance with the law,” he said.
The secretary said those working with the health department or MTIs were appointed by the government, which would ensure that all work properly to ensure better patient care.
He said the MTI policy board had already asked medical specialists to quit their health department jobs, but most of them didn’t comply with the instructions.
“We have to ensure that those doing jobs in two places retain their MTI job,” he said.
Mr Orakzai said lists of such doctors would be prepared in consultation with MTIs and those found to be doing two jobs at the same time would be de-notified by the health department.
The government had enforced the MTIRA in 2015 granting financial and administrative autonomy to teaching hospitals in the province to improve patient care.
Until now, the law has been extended to 11 hospitals and their affiliated colleges. Under the law, the MTIs are managed by the respective boards of governors, which take key decisions.
The MTIs have recruited specialist doctors as assistant professors for a three years period on renewable contractual basis against the monthly payment of Rs250,000. The law has bound them to work with MTIs only. They are also barred from doing private practice outside hospitals.
Under the law, all MTIs have begun institution-based practice (IBP) in the evening. Patients are examined by doctors privately.
Officials said many consultants didn’t want to do IBP and illegally ran private clinics. They said the MTIs had been issuing such staff members notices from time to time, but to no avail.
The officials said the MTI consultants continued to skip IBP and secretly do private practice outside hospitals. Dean of the Khyber Teaching Hospital Prof Mahmud Aurangzeb told Dawn that his hospital had issued two notices in Sept and Oct asking consultants to stop private work and take up IBP.
“They [consultants] have signed contracts promising they will do MTI jobs as well as IBP, but out of 60 consultants, 40 are doing private practice outside hospitals. The rest are doing the IBP diligently,” he said.
Prof Mahmud said such doctors wanted to work as civil servants and MTI consultants at the same time violating the law.
“We have conveyed our reservations to the health department about this illegal practice and hope for the issuance of a notification about it,” he said.

“During the past eight years, the PTI government acquired the lands of those people who were affiliated with other political parties. The government even shifted the sites of the projects if the land belonged to people of the ruling party,” they alleged. 
The speakers challenged that if they were shown any case wherein the provincial government had acquired the land of the PTI activists under section 4, they would give them a big reward. 
They said they would not let the government to deprive the people of their precious lands. They said the corrupt government was benefiting people who belonged to PTI and depriving others of their orchards.

Addressing a press conference, Ittehad Kashthkaran general secretary and Tobacco Growers Association Pakistan central president Liaquat Yousafzai said that a crop status should be given to tobacco like cotton so that exploitation of farmers could be stopped by the tobacco companies. 
Flanked by other leaders and jirga members, he said the federal and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa governments were earning Rs130-150 billion every year through central excise duty and other taxes on tobacco. He demanded that10 per cent of the total amount should be spent on the welfare of tobacco growers in the crop cultivation districts of the province. 

Say 10pc of total taxes should be spent on welfare of growers

Mr Yousafzai and other leaders sought provision of financial assistance to the growers because the expenditures on growing and curing the crop had increased manifold. They said the past practice was that tobacco purchasing centres were established by the companies in the cultivating regions, but this was no longer the situation. He said the farmers wanted that buying points of the purchasers must be in the crop growing areas. 
They claimed that various small cigarette manufacturers had shifted their business to Azad Kashmir because the environment here was not friendly for the investors. They demanded that the government should devise policies to attract investors to the tobacco growing regions. 
Ittehad Kashthkaran president Arif Ali Khan said the companies should conduct a survey to know about the farmers’ tobacco furnaces and agreements should be issued to them on that basis. 
They said about 800,000 kilogrammes tobacco had still been lying with growers which should be picked up by the companies. 
They said a meeting of the growers and jirga members would be held on Tuesday.

The Peshawar Higher Court had ordered closure of such units.
Speaking at a meeting held here, Mr Islam said gravel mining was dangerous for various reasons as it not only disfigured the beautiful landscape of the riverside but also caused deforestation and water pollution. He said any illegal activity along the Swat River won’t be tolerated.
Malakand deputy commissioner Mohammad Arif Khan Yousafzai, additional deputy commissioner Swat, officials of the Environmental Protection Agency, Swat, mines and minerals, irrigation and other relevant departments attended the meeting.
Officials of the mines and minerals and irrigation departments informed the meeting about the steps already taken to prevent illegal activities along the riverbed.
Commissioner Zaheerul Islam said no leniency should be shown to those who were harming the environment and beauty of Swat River. “Some vested interests, who are involved in gravel mining, should not be allowed to spoil the natural beauty and environment of the area,” he said.
The commissioner also ordered continuous surveillance along the river and timely action against any illegal activity. “Full implementation of the high court orders should be ensured,” he directed, warning that action would be taken against the assistant commissioner concerned in case of negligence in implementation of the court orders.
