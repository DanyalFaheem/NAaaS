0,Judge cancels bail of MQM man for ‘misbehaviour’,The MQM leader argued with the judge during court proceedings.,"KARACHI: An antiterrorism court on Saturday cancelled the bail of a Muttahida Qaumi Move­ment leader over his inappropriate behaviour with the judge, said court staff and lawyers.
Senior MQM leaders including Dr Farooq Sattar, Amir Khan, Abdul Qadir Khanzada, Qamar Man­soor, Gulfaraz Kha­ttak, Kanwar Naveed along with nearly 200 party workers are facing trial in a case related to a violent protest, arson attack and ransacking of media houses following an incendiary speech of MQM founder Altaf Hussain in 2016.
They are also facing trial in another case pertaining to incendiary speech of Altaf Hussain outside the Karachi Press Club on Aug 22, 2016.
On Saturday, the matter came up before the judge of the ATC-II for cross-examination of a prosecution witness. MQM leaders appeared in court on bail.
The witness, Muhammad Aslam, said to be the security in charge of a private news channel, appeared for his cross-examination by the defence counsel for the accused.
The court staffers and lawyers said that during the proceedings MQM leader Gulfaraz Khattak indulged in an argument with the judge and also exchanged words with her.
The judge took serious exception to his behaviour and cancelled his bail granted earlier in both the cases. Subsequently, the police arrested him and shifted him to the Boat Basin police station.
Khattak is also serving as an assistant attorney general for the federal government in Sindh.

1,Illegalities come to light as probe into Karachi's Shershah blast begins,Two separate inquiries have been instituted by authorities.,"KARACHI: Saturday’s blast in a Shershah building that killed over a dozen people and left many injured has emerged as a grim reminder of unchecked encroachment on government and municipal facilities for commercial purposes, unplanned expansion of concrete structures in Karachi and illegal use of government land and facilities continuing unabated for the past many years. 
Two separate inquiries have been instituted by authorities as the chief minister of Sindh has asked the Karachi commissioner to investigate the incident while the provincial industries minister has asked the managing director (MD) of the Sindh Industrial Trading Estate (SITE) to find out the exact cause of the deadly explosion. 
The orders from the provincial authorities came after initial reports from the bomb disposal unit of the Sindh police found leakage of sewer gas — complex mixture of toxic and non-toxic gases produced and collected in sewage systems — as the apparent cause of the blast and found no evidence or traces of any sabotage, terrorism and explosives. 
The Sui Southern Gas Company Limited (SSGCL), after examining the site, has also ruled out the natural gas leak possibility from its supply system, saying that there was no damage to its installation in and around the site. 

Minister says building was constructed in 1964; two separate inquiries launched

Now investigators, rescue operators and municipal authorities strongly believe that the explosion is caused by the sewer gas accumulated in the sewage drain, nullah, over which a two-storey structure was raised. 
The theory is further strengthened as the official inquiries are apparently aimed at finding the cause of the explosion while keeping in view the illegalities involved in the incident. 
Speaking to reporters after visiting the blast site, Sindh Minister for Industries and Commerce and Cooperative Department Ikramullah Dharejo announced setting up a committee headed by the MD-SITE to find out the cause of the blast. 
“It will be premature to reach any conclusion,” he said. “There is a sewerage nullah here and there are several buildings along or over this structure. This particular building was built in 1964. The structure was raised more than 50 years ago on a drain. The MD-SITE has also been directed to submit a report on the accident. It is not appropriate to say anything right now. All aspects would be investigated for accurate conclusion.” 
Complicated situation 
The situation turned further complicated as key officials of the concerned district office expressed their lack of knowledge regarding any legal or illegal status of the affected building. 
Mukhtiar Ali Abro, deputy commissioner-Keamari, was also not sure whether the building had been marked as an encroached structure during a recent survey for an anti-encroachment operation. 
As the final report of a thorough and transparent inquiry may explain the unanswered questions about the building’s status, its owners and exact reason leading to the huge explosion in the sewer, the authorities also keep the police investigators in the loop to look into every possible aspect of the incident. 
CM expresses grief over loss of lives 
Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah while taking notice of the Shershah blast ordered the Karachi Commissioner to hold a detailed inquiry into the incident. 
“The police officers should also be made part of the inquiry as every angle of the incident could be covered,” said a statement issued by CM House. 
“CM Murad also expressed his deep grief over the loss of lives in the blast. He has directed the secretary of health for the provision of all necessary facilities immediately at the Civil Hospital Karachi. He has also directed the administration to reach the spot to provide all possible assistance to the victims.” 
No legal cover for illegal structures 
On the other hand, Sindh government spokesman and Karachi Administrator Murtaza Wahab made it clear that the government’s proposed law for regularisation of buildings would not give any ‘legal cover’ to buildings like the one in Shershah, which were raised over drains. 
“The Sindh Commission for Regularisation of Construction Ordinance is not supposed to support illegal structures,” he said while replying to a query during his interaction with the media at the Civil Hospital, where he came to see the blast victims. 
“Every such building which is illegal and poses serious threat to lives of people would face the legal action. This law would not legalise ‘China-Cutting’ carried out in the past and encroachments and use of amenity plots for commercial uses.”

2,Work to revamp Mahmoodabad Nullah finalised,Asad Umar says the Karachi Transformation Plan is a reflection of the federal govt's commitment to the city's development.,"KARACHI: Federal Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Asad Umar on Saturday said that foreign investors had shown keen interest to become part of the Karachi Circular Railway project and the government was considering all possible options before picking up the best to complete it in two years.
Addressing a ceremony to mark the restoration and revamping of Mahmoodabad Nullah, he said that the completion of the major drain under the Prime Minister’s Rs1.1 trillion Karachi Transformation Plan was a reflection of the federal government’s commitment for development of the metropolis.
“When the Karachi Transformation Plan was announced in September 2020, we marked three nullahs for restoration to modernise the city’s drainage system and keep it safe from urban flooding during rains,” he said. 
“This Mahmoodabad nullah is one of them and the work is also under progress on two others drains — Orangi Nullah and Gujjar Nullah. So Karachiites should know that all the projects under the KTP including freight corridor, water supply through K-IV and KCR would be completed within the stipulated time,” he said.
He said that the port city’s betterment did not fall within the ambit of the federal government, yet Prime Minister Imran Khan gave special attention to Karachi. 
Minister for Maritime Affairs Ali Zaidi was also present.

3,Classical dance performance enthrals audience,Sheema Kermani laments performing arts are dying in country...,"KARACHI: Classical dancer, social activist and founder of the cultural action group Tehrik-e-Niswan, Sheema Kermani has organised a debut for her young disciple Anjaleen Maryam Agrawalla at the Alliance Française.
Anjaleen was six years old when she came to train under Kermani. During this time she learned various classical dance forms such as the Bharatanatyam, Odissi and Kathak as she also joined Tehrik-i-Niswan and performed in their numerous events and festivals.
As explained by her guru Kermani, a student dancer’s solo stage dance debut performance after completion of years of training is called an ‘arangetram’. It is organised by the guru to introduce the disciple to the audience while giving blessings.

Sheema Kermani laments performing arts are dying in country

As she took the audience through the programme on Friday evening, Kermani also shared memories of her own journey in classical dance. She said that she started teaching classical dance for free some 40 years ago in her mother’s car garage. 
“I had many students in the beginning. But now, as time goes by, I have less and less students and I often wonder why people here are so biased and narrow-minded in arts? Why don’t they celebrate diversity? Why don’t they celebrate pluralism,” she asked.
She said that she herself started learning classical dance as a young girl when her mother found Mr and Mrs Ghanshyam, a couple from Calcutta, who had set up an institute for the teaching of dance and music in Karachi. 
“In the 1960s, they had hundreds of students but then they were forced to leave Pakistan during Ziaul Haq’s rule. Sadly, not many have been able to make dance their profession in this country. I have been lucky to make a living out of it,” she said.
“The performing arts are dying in this country. Dance and music are usually passed down through the generations. But today even my sitar player, an ustad, prefers that his son work in a hotel,” she said.
The young debutant dancer Anjaleen then took to the stage holding flowers in her hands. She performed three salutations, to God, to her guruand her audience while also asking forgiveness of Mother Earth for stamping on it as she danced the Pushpanjali. 
Her performance consisted of Bharatanatyam dances, an ancient form of classical dance of the subcontinent using hand gestures and facial expressions. 
She performed seven dances including Alarippu, a dance based on rhythm that relaxes the mind and body for upcoming dances, the Jatiswaram, an abstract dance concentrating on the melody alone, the Shabdam, a dance to a song, the Varnam, the main dance of the entire Bharatanatyam performance, the Abhinaya, an intense dance, and the Tillana, a lively joyful dance.

5,Urdu translation of Surkh Salam launched,KARACHI: The Urdu translation of Kamran Asdar Ali’s book Surkh Salam (about communist politics and class activism...,"


 
KARACHI: The Urdu translation of Kamran Asdar Ali’s book Surkh Salam (about communist politics and class activism in Pakistan, 1947-1972) by Nadeem Akhtar was launched at The Lyceum on Saturday evening.
Dr Syed Jaffer Ahmed, who was the first speaker at the event, said he had read the book when it was first published in English [in 2015]. Contrary to the notion that not much has been written on the subject, he has gone through 15 to 16 books on it. Kamran Asdar’s book is an addition to them. The author is a trained historian and anthropologist; and both these aspects can be found in his work. The book is written on the basis of primary sources. There’s use of documents and archival material in it. Then there are interviews conducted by the author himself. He enters the book in the first person [narrative], which is not usually found in history books but can be done in anthropological texts. 
Dr Ahmed said the book is not the history of the last 70 to 75 years of the Left. It basically sheds light on the crises that the Communist Party (CP) and the Progressive Writers Movement (PWM) in the first seven or eight years of Pakistan’s independence had to go through. In that, the author has made a few persons prominent. He has especially spent a lot of time on Sajjad Zaheer. The opinion that he’s formed of Zaheer appears to be influenced by Sibte Hasan’s work Mughanni-i-Aatish Nafas. 
After giving his opinion on the Rawalpindi conspiracy case at length, Dr Ahmed returned to the book and pointed out that it’s not the final piece on the topic, and that an authentic history of the Left is still needed. 
Dr Ali Raza said like Dr Ahmed he has read the book both in English and Urdu. After reading the Urdu version he realised how connected (juri hui hai) the subject is to us. The narration in it of the different relations (rishton ka qissa) immersed in politics makes it worth noticing how we write this history of loss or failure and what sources we use for it. The book reminds us that it’s our responsibility to reach out to and write about these histories — the responsibility to preserve our archives and memories. 
Dr Raza said apart from such a thesis the mention of the struggle is found in police files where it’s presented as a seditious and foreign movement, as if it has nothing to do with our land (hamara khitta). The Urdu translation reminds us that the [Communist] party and its ideology (soch) had a deep relation with this land. The one thing common in colonial rule and the post-independence period is that both painted such a struggle or political movement as something foreign (bairuni). 
Anoushay Malik said she was introduced to Kamran Asdar’s work when she was an undergraduate at LUMS. At the time she was working on the students’ movement and chanced upon one of his papers online. The paper was about Karachi’s 1971 labour movement. She had met in Lahore a few people who used to tell her about the movement in their city. She sent Kamran Asdar an email which he replied politely and agreed that work [about the movement] on Lahore hadn’t been undertaken. 
About the book, Ms Malik said she sees it as a continuation of the struggle which is still part of Pakistan’s history. 
Translator Nadeem Akhtar said it was Dr Jaffer Ahmed who had suggested his [Akhtar’s] name for translation. He urged that research work should be done to let the younger generation know about such an important movement and its background. He added while translating a book a few things should be paid attention to: one, the translator mustn’t try and overwhelm the original work [author]; two, the feelings and sentiments of the original work should be reflected in the translation; and the target reader should be kept in mind.
Kamran Asdar Ali thanked the guests for their presence and remembered the late Dr Asif Farrukhi with fondness, who moderated the book’s launch at T2F in January, 2016 when it was published in English. 
Ameem Lutfi moderated the event.

Two students also received their doctoral degrees. During the ceremony, 29 students were declared best graduates, whereas 171 students received gold, silver and bronze medals.
Speaking at the ceremony, Sindh Governor Imran Ismail, also the university chancellor, announced that the federal government would help university students take benefit from Prime Ministers’ Kamyab Jawan Programme and set up its office on the Ojha campus.
“If someone can put Pakistan on the path of development, it is you. Continue to work hard and brighten the country’s future,” the governor said, adding that only a sustained struggle could bring about durable success.
He urged parents to support their daughters in pursuing their dreams. “They are seen more worried about their marriage than education. They don’t realise that girls are as talented as boys and need their [parents] assistance to harness their potential. Parents have a greater role to play in our society. They are the ones who can give their daughters the confidence required to face life.”
In her address, Health Minister Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho congratulated students on their achievement and reminded them of the responsibilities they had on their shoulders.
“The journey has just begun and you need to prove yourself on many fronts. Show the best of your abilities and never give up.”
DUHS Vice Chancellor Prof Mohammad Saeed Quraishy informed the audience about the university’s progress over the years, and said it had been included in the top 400 universities of Asia.
He also shared the recent steps the university had taken for energy and nature conservation.

10,Miftah holds PPP govt responsible for poverty in Sindh,‘Both PPP and MQM-P destroyed peace in Karachi’...,"HYDERABAD: Pakistan Mus­l­im League-Nawaz (PML-N) Sindh general secretary Miftah Ismail has said that the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) government in Sindh would have to show its performance over its 14 years of rule over the province. “It must tell people as to how many industrial zones have been set up and how much investment has been made in Sindh during the period,” he said.
Speaking to journalists and addressing a seminar on ‘Natural resources, poverty and solution’ organised by his party’s cultural wing here on Saturday, he alleged that PPP wanted to centralise powers and resources.
“Sindh produces 65pc gas but its cities and villages do not get this resource,” he said, and called for making the 18th Amendment stronger and more effective.
He was of the view that the 18th Amendment would remain incomplete as long as powers were concentrated in chief minister or an individual. He suggested that all the ministries that had been devolved to provinces be closed at the level of Centre.

‘Both PPP and MQM-P destroyed peace in Karachi’

He argued that when the subject of law and order was with provincial government, why does the federal interior ministry exist. 
Mr Ismail, who is a former federal finance minister, disagreed with former Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR) chairman Shabbar Zaidi that “Pakistan has gone bankrupt” but observed that the [Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf] government was leading the country to the brink of bankruptcy. “The PTI government is increasing debt of Pakistan, which is not a company but a state,” he remarked.
He said prices of commodities had gone high in the PTI government, “but the ruling party is not ashamed of it”.
He claimed that the PTI government had utterly failed. Despite lapse of three years, it appeared not ready to take responsibility for the price hike. 
Corruption by PML-N denied
The senior PML-N leader said that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) Authority had confirmed that no corruption had been seen in the venture [during PML-N rule]. “All power plants established by the PML-N government were vital; no corruption had been committed in CPEC projects. 
[Prime Minister] Imran Khan should prove the charges if he finds corruption of a single penny in these projects; pointing finger or hurling accusations is an easy job,” he said.
Controversial LG bill
Miftah Ismail described the PPP and Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) as “two sides of the same coin”. He observed that one was raising issues of Karachi and the other was using people of rural Sindh. The way the PPP bulldozed the Sindh Local Government Bill was unfair, he said, adding that it would not be justified that decisions about hospitals of Dadu and Sanghar were taken at Bilawal House or by chief minister.
‘Why people of this rich province are poor?’
Earlier, addressing the seminar, he wondered that “Sindh is rich in resources but its people are poor”. He observed that local people were not getting compensation for the resources, and pointed out that Sindh produced oil and gas; it had coal reserves in Tharparkar as well. However, he noted, the province remained without adequate electricity despite having 1.25bn tonnes of coal deposits. 
The PML-N provincial chief said that [former prime minister and party chief] Nawaz Sharif had persuaded China to start work on the Thar coal project. 
The PPP had been ruling over Sindh for the last 14 years but did not deliver anything to its people. “Today, people of this province are fed-up with the party of Z.A. Bhutto and Benazir Bhutto,” he claimed.
Mr Ismail said that during the tenure of [former president] Asif Ali Zardari, the federal government used to release Rs300bn annually to Sindh in addition to 25pc share out of federal receipts. 
When Nawaz Sharif took over as the prime minister, these releases increased to Rs600bn and Sindh had been getting royalty on oil and gas from the Centre as well; “but figures were fudged in Sindh’s budget”. 
Considering resources of Sindh, this province should not face poverty, he said. 
Law and order
Miftah Islamil stressed that federal government should work for development in Sindh, “which has been ruled by inept people”. 
He noted that the PPP and MQM-P had now started showing pain for Sindh although “both these parties had destroyed peace in Karachi”. 
He alleged that PPP got people killed through [Lyari] Aman Committee while MQM-P had also been involved in bloodshed.
Justice Wajih’s claim
He supported retired Justice Wajihuddin Ahmed’s statement that the expenses of Imran Khan’s Bani Gala house were borne by his friends like Jehangir Tareen. 
He claimed Mr Khan never earned money in his life, and wondered how he had been living in a house stretched over an area of 300 kanals. He said the electricity bill of Mr Khan’s house must have been Rs500,000-Rs600,000 per month. 
He said that how the man who was paying Rs150,000 tax was affording it.
Mr Ismail said that was why adjournments [in the PTI foreign funding] case were being sought. He added that everyone also knew that Mr Khan had been using the vehicle provided by Jehangir Tareen. 
Therefore, it could not be a secret that expenses of his house were being borne by his friends, he added.
PML-N Hyderabad division president Sardar Anwar Soomro, Akbar Soomro, Mahesh Gupta and others also spoke at the seminar.

11,Sindh govt urged to stop backing feudal system,HYDERABAD: The Hari Welfare Association (HWA) has expressed its concern over Sindh government’s continuous support...,"HYDERABAD: The Hari Welfare Association (HWA) has expressed its concern over Sindh government’s continuous support for feudal system and structure and its act of siding with feudal lords in violating fundamental rights of peasants by pursuing its appeal in Supreme Court against Sindh High Court’s landmark judgement on the Sindh Tenancy (Amendment) Act (STA) 2013.
The SHC had struck down Section 6 of the STA 2013 and Section 24-C of the STA 1950 was inserted to omit prohibition of begaar (unpaid labour).
In a statement issued here on Saturday, HWA president Akram Khaskheli said that the judgement had ruled that after separation of the judiciary from the executive, assistant commissioners, additional commissioners and commissioners/collectors did not have powers to make decisions in judicial matters under sections 27, 29 and 30 of the Act and executive’s actions were against the provisions of Article 175, 202 and 203 of the Constitution.
Mr Khaskheli said that the SHC had ordered provincial government to make amendments to the STA 1950 and take necessary measures, including transfer of all cases of peasants under the STA to the judiciary. “Instead of complying with the SHC decision and protecting rights of peasants in the tyrannical feudal system and structure, government sided with feudal lords to curb and violate fundamental rights of peasants in Sindh,” he said.
He pointed out that peasants in Sindh were continuously protesting over Sindh government’s appeal and demanding its withdrawal. He said peasants were feeling insecure. He said the SHC had handed down its verdict on a petition filed by a peasant, Ghulam Ali Laghari, who was exploited, abused and tortured by a landlord and was denied his 35 years’ share in crop. He was forced to vacate his house and the land.
The HWA leader noted that Pakistan had endorsed adoption of the ‘UN Declaration on Rights of Peasants and Other People Working in Rural Areas’ and committed to protect rights of peasants. Rather than addressing weaknesses in the STA, Sindh government decided to stick to the exploitation. Weak provisions in the STA resulted in debt bondage, abuse and exploitation of peasants, he said.
