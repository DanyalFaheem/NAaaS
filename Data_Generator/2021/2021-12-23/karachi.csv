2,Man in Karachi gets four years in prison for stripping woman,The judge noted that the prosecution fully established the charge against the accused without a shadow of a doubt.,"KARACHI: A magistrate on Wednesday sentenced a man to four years in prison for stripping a woman and blackmailing her on the basis of her nude photos.
Accused Shahrukh was charged with stripping the victim, taking her pictures and blackmailing her in Ittehad Town in September.
On Wednesday, Judicial Magistrate (west) Shiraz Ahmed Sheikh pronounced his verdict reserved after recording evidence and final arguments from both sides.
The judge noted that the prosecution fully established the charge against the accused without a shadow of a doubt.
The judge sentenced him to a collective sentence of four year and three months on three counts — criminal house trespass, assault or criminal force to outrage a woman’s modesty and criminal intimidation.
State prosecutor Saleem Abbas Soomro said according to the complainant his wife was alone at their home when accused Shahrukh along with an unknown woman came there and attempted to grab his wife.
He further said that the victim resisted his attempt but he managed to strip her, took her photos, threatened her of dire consequences if she narrated the incident to anyone and left the house.
The prosecutor argued that the pictures of the victim were successfully recovered and statements of the witnesses recorded, adding that the forensic and ocular evidence fully corroborated the allegations.
He pleaded the court to punish him according to the law.
On the other hand, defence counsel Bilal Memon contended that his client was innocent and he was framed in the present case by the complainant due to some personal grudge.
He submitted that the investigating officer did not record the testimony of any area resident as witness, as those produced by him belonged to the same family, thus they were not independent.
The counsel pleaded the judge to acquit his client of the false and fabricated charges.
A case was registered under Sections 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 506 (criminal intimidation), 447 (punishment for criminal trespass) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code at the Ittehad Town police station.

Addressing a press conference after signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the Ministry of Information, National Arts Council and Pakistan Television (PTV) regarding National Entertainment Awards, the minister said that political debates did not promote the national narrative as effectively as do the mediums of entertainment.
He said the next National Entertainment Awards would be the largest in the history of the country. Rs250 million would be allocated for 22 awards in film, television and music categories.
The minister said the new film policy had been finalised which would give many incentives to the local film makers, whereas foreign content would be taxed.
The minister said he had proposed to the Federal Board of Revenue that imported dramas should be taxed to protect local entertainment industry. Instead of foreign artists, casting of local ones in advertisement would be encouraged, he added.
He announced one-window system to attract foreign filmmakers to shoot their movies in Pakistan. A film division had been set up in the PTV which would encourage young filmmakers, he added.
Mr Chaudhry said the national TV film division was producing two big-budget movies on the lives of Mughal King Babar and national poet Allama Iqbal with the collaboration of Uzbekistan and Iran, respectively. Moreover, a private firm was making a film on the life of Tipu Sultan.
Speaking g on the occasion, President of Arts Council of Pakistan Mohammad Ahmed Shah said the national awards to be held under the patronage of the government would be totally merit-based and no favour would be given to anyone.
He said the Arts Council would host next international Urdu Conference in Islamabad in March next year.
Mr Shah said Urdu conference would strengthen the federation and national harmony.

They said that progressive intellectuals needed to launch a serious discourse to resist the state’s narrative of militancy, religious extremism, terrorism and coercion.
They were speaking at a session on Role of intellectuals on post-colonialism on the second day of the 7th Ayaz Melo being held under the aegis of Khanabadosh writers cafe here on Wednesday.
Initiating debate, Dr Jaffar Ahmed, former director of Pakistan Study Centre, University of Karachi, discussed how the de-colonisation process was seen in Latin America and Africa after freedom from colonial yoke but no serious effort was seen in the subcontinent. 
“We got liberation but our model of colonisation remained intact in post colonial era,” he said, adding that intellectuals fought against post-colonialism and produced poetry of resistance.  
He said that states where de-colonisation process was successful modernised their indigenous cultures. “We have to stick to indigenous cultures but have to modernise them as well,” he said while regretting the varsities were not producing new ideas. 
“They look like mere extensions of colleges. Have we produced any sociologist or political scientist of note?” he asked and said Hamza Alvi and Ayesha Jalal, were Pakistani origin, but they grew on foreign soil.
“Progressive intellectuals will have to fight a battle against state sponsored militancy and religious extremism,” he said, adding western hegemony should be opposed. 
Seasoned journalist and author Ghazi Salahuddin said Pakistan was termed ‘a place insufficiently imagined’. “We need to re-imagine Pakistan,” he said. 
He said that Pakistan needed to have intellectuals failing which its survival would be at stake. “We need intellectuals and not heroes and we need people who make us start dreaming again,” he said.
Dr Sahar Gul said that state coercion and terrorism would have to be resisted. “We made traitors heroes and vice versa and we did nothing to reform syllabi,” she said. “Sindh faced a class question but it turned into an ethno-centric dilemma,” she said. 
She said that it was intellectuals’ job to abridge this divide. “We must rise against state coercion and terrorism. Today we need a narrative that has an element of pluralism and secularism,” she said.
Dr Zafar Junejo said that intellectuals felt insecure and used ‘censored’ language for rulers’ fear. “In fact intellectuals will have to de-colonise themselves first,” he said.
He said that authors and intellectuals had to expose official lies. “Intellectuals will have to pay a price for an alternate narrative for which they should be ready. Those who try to side with people as well as with government are in fact not with masses,” he said. 
He said that intellectuals always challenged de-politicisation because a society’s salvation was in its politicisation.
Meanwhile, Harris Khalique’s book Hairan sar-e-bazaar was also launched at a session moderated by Amar Sindhu. At another session collection of Sheikh Ayaz’s letters compiled by Dr Fayyaz Latif was launched. 
Sheikh Ayaz termed heritage of Sindh
Speakers at the inaugural session of the Melo a day before termed Sheikh Ayaz a heritage of Sindh and said people would have to turn to his poetry for seeking answers to today’s existential and political crisis. 
Sindh Minister for Culture and Education Syed Sardar Ali Shah, who presided over the session, said that Ayaz witnessed tragedies and transformed them into poetry. Today, the state liked making people apolitical although politics triggered change, he said.  
He said that people took pleasure in issuing certificates for patriotism and treason.  
He proposed introducing ‘Ayaz shansi’ in schools and announced the culture department would celebrate 100 years of excavation of Moenjodaro. 
Author and poet Harris Khalique said: “We will have to find recourse to present crisis in the poetry of Ayaz as we are confronted with existential, political and social crisis”.  
He said that military institutions’ interference in political decision making and economic matters had led to governance issues. Present right wing government had stifled critical voices, gagged media, confiscated books and censored news, he said. 
He said that ironically Allama Iqbal was made state’s poet but Bhitai’s poetry remained a common legacy. Ayaz remained connected with international literature of resistance movements and remained worried about tyranny against his motherland. “It is like one talks about Palestine but forgets East Pakistan or feel pain for occupied Kashmir but does not mention Balochistan,” he said. 
Dr Sahar Imdad said that Ayaz always talked in a decent manner and never indulged in bickering with opponents. He had reflected Sindh’s pain in his poetry, she said.  
Madad Ali Sindhi said that all those who fought for their motherland and nation could never be forgotten.

The minister told media persons at Sindh House here on Wednesday before embarking on a visit of the rural area of Umerkot and Tharparkar to inspect health facilities that the federal government would bear only 25 per cent of bill and the remaining 75pc would be deducted from provincial health budget. After the Rs1 million had been expended in three days in s private hospital, patients would be thrown out, she said.
She said that the federal government would keep on increasing its premier and the private hospitals their bills. It would have been more productive if this amount had been honestly utilised on the improvement of facilities in present healthcare system, she said.
The minister said in answer to a question that there was acute shortage of specialists, especially gynaecologists in Mirpurkhas division. Her department planned to recruit trained midwives in basic health units and dispensaries and establish a medical college soon in Mirpurkhas, she said.
She said that they had transferred doctors from big cities to their areas of domicile and deplored that most doctors were not ready to serve in their areas. Biometric system would be introduced in hospitals soon to ensure 100 per cent attendance of healthcare staff, she said.
She admitted that they did not have trained staff and equipment to deal with emergency cases. Therefore, she had spoken to a number of foreign qualified trainers to train general surgeons in dealing with emergency cases, she said.
She agreed with a questioner that quality of medicines available in government hospitals was not better and central procurement system was actively handling the issue. She would try her best to maintain quality of drugs, she said.
She said that a new building would soon be handed over to Umerkot Civil Hospital in February 2022.
Meanwhile, the staff at the Umerkot Civil Hospital had cleaned up streets, wards and corridors and replaced local drugs usually given to patients on normal days with the multinational ones for fear the minister might visit the facility but she did not.

8,"SHC accepts Arzoo’s plea to live with parents, practise Islam",Stops her from meeting putative husband,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Wednesday allowed an underage girl, who had contracted free-will marriage last year after converting from Christianity to Islam, to leave a shelter home and live with her parents.
While allowing the application of Arzoo seeking reunion with her parents after spending over a year in the shelter home, a two-judge bench headed by Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha directed her parents not to pressurise their daughter to change her religion, allow the girl to adopt her own life choices and not cause any physical or mental harm to her.
The bench further asked the girl’s parents to produce her before the SHO concerned after every three months until she reached the age of 18 years and the police officer must certify that she was well-treated by her parents and communicate the same to the SHC through its member inspection team (MIT).
In November 2020, the SHC had sent the girl to a shelter home after finding her marriage invalid for being underage as she had refused to go with her parents and insisted on going to her ‘husband’s house.

Stops her from meeting putative husband

The SHC had observed that prima facie it was not possible for her to enter into a legally valid marriage under the Sindh Marriages Restraint Act (SCMRA) 2013 since she was under 18 and directed the police to take action against her alleged husband Syed Ali Azhar and others responsible for the underage marriage after a medical board had confirmed that she was around 14 years of age at the time of marriage.
On Tuesday, Arzoo sent an application to the SHC from the shelter home seeking permission to go with her parents after pondering for over a year on her life choices.
When the bench took up the matter for hearing on Wednesday, the girl was produced in court and her lawyer Nizar Tanoli argued that since her client had converted to Islam she cannot be returned to her parents as they were Christians.
However, Jibran Nasir, the counsel for the parents of the girl, opposed this plea. When the judges asked Arzoo whether she had converted to Islam of her own freewill, she replied in the affirmative.
Replying to another question of the bench, she said that she was willing to return to her parents’ home.
The girl’s parents were also present during the proceedings and they said that they would welcome their daughter back to their home and undertook that they would not pressurise her to change her religion from Islam and would allow her to practise her religion freely and adopt her own life choices in this respect.
They assured the bench that they would not cause any harm to their daughter for converting to Islam and for initially deciding not to go with them.
“In the light of the above, we hereby direct that Mst. Arzoo Fatima be returned from Panah shelter home to her parents’ home where she will reside and be looked after by them,” the court order said.
The bench further said that the girl would not be allowed to meet her alleged husband, who had been facing criminal proceedings under the SCMRA and for the offence of rape.
Initially, Arzoo had petitioned the SHC seeking a restraining order against the registration of a kidnapping case against her spouse, in-laws and others by her family at the Frere police station and in October last year the high court had directed the police not to make any arrest and provide protection to the couple.
However, the parents of the girl submitted that she was 13 and had forcibly been converted to Islam after being abducted. Thereafter, the incident of alleged abduction, conversion and underage marriage had sparked protests from human rights bodies and thus, the SHC had ordered constitution of a medical board to determine her age.

A spokesperson for the Karachi police said that the 30-year-old Jamil Ahmed was admitted to the intensive care unit of a hospital due to his serious condition. He was unconscious after sustaining serious head injuries. 
After undergoing surgery, doctors put him on ventilator but he couldn’t survive, the spokesperson said.
“The victim originally hailed from Rajanpur. He used to work as a labourer in the same [Shershah] area. His family took his body for burial in his hometown after medico-legal formalities,” said a health official.
On Dec 18, a deadly explosion in buildings constructed on a drain apparently due to accumulation of gases led to the collapse of a private bank branch and other structure killing 17 persons. 
The father of MNA Alamgir Khan of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf was among the victims.
Investigators probing the blast had already sent several pieces of evidence collected from the scene to two labs for a forensic examination to determine the exact cause of the explosion.
As investigators were not sure about a preliminary report submitted by the bomb disposal squad that exiting of gases from the drain running underneath the building caused the blast, they decided to widen the scope of investigation.
Earlier, the Karachi police had said that according to the preliminary report, it seemed that the explosion was caused by gas accumulated in the nullah on which the bank was built.

“But a neighbour of the particular home witnessing suspicious movement called police helpline Madadgar 15,” said an official at the Model Colony police station.  
“The Madadgar 15 after confirming the location passed the message to our police station. A police party then on two mobiles rushed to the spot. They found a suspicious man standing outside the house. After seeing the danger, the suspect fired shots at the police and ran into the house.”  
The personnel of the law-enforcement agency cordoned off the area, the officer said and added the armed men inside the house attacked the policemen when they were busy taking positions. The bullets hit police constable Farhan leaving him badly wounded.  
“The attack on the police resulted in retaliation from our side and an exchange of gunfire took place. The firing left one of the suspects dead on the spot. However, two of them ran away under the cover of heavy firing. The wounded constable was taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre [JPMC] where he’s said to be in critical condition,” he added.  
The police seized a car, three pistols and all the looted cash and valuables from the bandits, the police officer said.
He added that the body of the deceased had been taken to the Edhi morgue for want of identification after medico-legal formalities at the JPMC.

12,Experts term four elephants’ overall health good despite minor issues,"Foot, tusk and other problems are curable, court told","KARACHI: A team of veterinary experts on Wednesday submitted final and detailed reports about the condition of four African elephants being kept at the Karachi Zoo and the Safari Park before the Sindh High Court and said that overall health condition of the elephants was good.
However, the team said that the two elephants kept at the Safari Park had curable foot problems and the elephants at Karachi Zoo had tusk issues as well as low haemoglobin concentration.

Foot, tusk and other problems are curable, court told

The team headed by German veterinarian Dr Frank Goritz also suggested some immediate and long-term measures to address foot, dental and other issues.
The reports said that in the light of the SHC order, the team carried out examination of the elephants on Nov 29 and standing sedation was performed through blow pipe for detailed examination, blood and urine collection for analysis, body measurements for scientifically based calculation of body condition scoring index and other procedures.
“Overall the elephants housed in Karachi Zoo and Safari Park are in good health condition, having body condition scoring (3.5-4.5) slightly overweight. Trans-rectal ultrasonography and the rapid blood analysis showed no major pathology of vital organs, however both elephants at the zoo showed low haemoglobin concentration,” it added.
Both elephants at the Karachi Zoo have tusk problems as tusk cavities are exposed and the elephants at Safari Park having foot problems (cracked foot pad, overgrown and malformed nails) which are curable, the reports said.
It recommended that since the elephants were slightly obese, walk must be a regular part of their routine, disinfection of tusk cavities, enrichments were mandatory and placement of tires, logs and other safe items would help promote their playful behaviour.
The reports further suggested surgical removal of damaged and infected tusks, proper foot care and vaccination of all elephants against tetanus and clostridium.
There is a dire need to overcome the issue of staff shortage both at Karachi Zoo and Safari Park and without proper staff, it is challenging to maintain and mange the zoo/park and upkeep the animals, the reports said.
The establishment of a central zoo authority at provincial /national levels was imperative to manage and administer zoos of the province/country for better liaison, coordination, animal exchange and capacity building of zoo workers and professionals, the reports stated.
A two-judge bench headed by Justice Aftab Ahmed Gorar took the reports on record and provided the copies to the lawyers for respondents as well as counsel for the petitioners and adjourned the matter for a date to be fixed by the office of the court later.
In September, the SHC had appointed Dr Goritz to verify the health condition of the elephants after an NGO for animals had petitioned the SHC seeking shifting of the elephants to an appropriate habitat.

13,MPAs concerned over non-functional effluent treatment plants,"Sepa chief informs task force on SDGs that city’s 470mgd industrial, municipal waste directly released into sea","KARACHI: Members of the provincial parliamentary task force on sustainable development goals (SDGs) on Wednesday expressed serious concern over the non-functioning of effluent treatment plants in the entire province.
Speaking at a meeting of the task force at the Sindh Assembly building, they also emphasised the need for measures to control the leakage of methane gas from LNG terminals around Karachi coast.
Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa) Director General Naeem Ahmed Mughal informed the meeting that an estimated 470 million gallons per day (mgd) industrial and municipal waste from Karachi was directly disposed of into the sea without any treatment. 
Of the 470mgd waste, 80 per cent was sewage and 20pc was industrial waste.

Sepa chief informs task force on SDGs that city’s 470mgd industrial, municipal waste directly released into sea

Mr Mughal told the meeting that the government planned to install seven combined effluent treatment plants (CETP) in the city’s industrial zones, but none of them was working.
“The Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) is the implementation agency for CETP and Sepa has a regulatory role,” he said.
He expressed concerns over the situation in other major cities of Sindh where, he said, industrial and municipal waste was directly discharged into the Indus river or its canals. 
He pointed out that all municipal and industrial sewage from Hyderabad was directly disposed of into Phuleli Canal without any treatment.
“The industrial effluent from the industries of Kotri is discharged into KB Feeder, which supplies drinking water to Karachi via Keenjhar Lake,” he said.
He said that Sepa closed down a cement factory in the Nooriabad industrial area for two months and only allowed it to operate when the management installed an air treatment plant.
He maintained that Sepa was trying to implement the Sindh Environmental Quality Standards (SEQS) and had closed down many industries, which were non-compliant to the standards.
“During the last three years, 209 treatment plants have been installed in the industries in Karachi, and 50 more water treatment plants are being installed,” he added.
The Sepa chief was also asked by the chairman of the task force to give a detailed briefing to other members of the assembly.
Pakistan most vulnerable to climate change
In another presentation, environmental expert Nasir Panhwar said that Pakistan was fifth most vulnerable country to climate change, water scarcity and extreme events in particular.
According to Mr Panhwar, damages and losses resulting from natural disasters in Pakistan over the past decade had exceeded $10 billion.
“Sindh is facing environmental challenges due to climate change,” he said, adding that the sea level along Karachi coast had risen approximately 10 centimetres in the last century and was expected to further rise by 60cm by the end of the century. 
He said that low-lying coastal areas in Indus Delta were facing sea intrusion, which destroyed millions of acres of the land. 
He said a climate change policy had been drafted, but was waiting for the approval.
Director of The Knowledge Forum Zeenia Shaukat said that about 80pc of the country’s energy came from fossil fuel-based means, and very little attention has been paid to generate energy from renewables.
She pointed out that persistent events such as heatwaves, regular flash floods, reduction in water resources and dwindling agriculture resources emphasised the need for stronger institutional action on climate change.
Another environmental expert, Jameel Junejo, said that due to the shortage of natural gas in the country, the government was developing Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminals to supply gas via pipes to different parts of the country. 
“Two LNG terminals have been developed and five are under construction. LNG is considered an environmentally safe fuel, but when it is handled and converted from liquid shape to gas for supply through pipes, methane gas is leaked which is dangerous for the environment. Methane gas leakage is more dangerous for the environment and human health than the emission coming out from other fossil fuel plants,” he said.
“In the energy mix, Pakistan is producing only three per cent of energy from renewables, whereas at least 30pc of energy should be produced from renewable,” he said.
The meeting was attended by task force chairman Pir Mujeeb ul Haque, MPAs Saeed Afridi, Farhat Seemi, Kalsoom Chandio, Shahzad Qureshi, Arsalan Taj Ghumman, Ghazala Siyal and Heer Soho.
