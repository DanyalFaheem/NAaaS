0,RED ZONE FILES: KP rings the alarm bell,"With its fortress breached, the PTI may now find itself fighting for its political survival.","Events are moving fast. Random dots are forming a pattern. Whispers are getting louder — and footsteps closer. Inside the Red Zone, the air is a little colder, the nights a little longer, and the mood a little darker. 
PTI’s humiliating defeat on its home ground is a shock that has sent the party high command reeling to the ropes. Here was this party boasting of a solid victory in the Punjab local government polls followed by a thumping triumph in the general elections. KP was taken for granted. This was IK territory. Unambiguously, unquestioningly and unabashedly IK territory. In this land he was the giant and his rivals puny Lilliputians scampering away in fear at the mention of his mandate.  PTI had it under control. PTI had it all stitched up. And PTI was planning to leverage the local government strength to win big in the general elections. It was all so wonderful, so beautiful, so magical… 
And then, Bam! 
Just like that, KP body-slammed PTI into the hard ground of reality. The unthinkable had happened to the unbreakable and it was unbearable. 
Editorial: A bloody nose from none other than JUI-F is a rude awakening for the PTI
Now the usual is combining with the predictable to paint the picture of a party putting up a brave face by ordering enquiries, summoning explanations and identifying scapegoats. But the smart ones in the party are also realising with a growing sense of alarm that what happens in KP may not stay in KP. When the centre of gravity is disturbed, everything is disturbed. With its fortress breached, the party may now find itself fighting for its political survival. 
This may not necessarily mean the government’s days are numbered. The enemies are inside the gates but they haven’t breached the royal quarters — so to speak — or the armoury, for that matter. The government still has plenty of fight left in it, and it may yet keep the assailants at bay by retreating into its inner sanctum, but the fundamental nature of the battle has changed. From being the hunter, PTI is now the hunted. 
Deep inside the Red Zone, the contours of new emerging realities are gradually coming into view. These are early days in this new phase in Pakistani politics but they appear more deliberate in their possible alteration of the status quo than in previous times. The trigger for this mini-upheaval — for the lack of a more appropriate word — is the controversy over the appointment of the new ISI DG. Cabinet ministers and government supporters had gone to great pains to underplay the episode and claimed all was well. It was, they said, a storm in a tea cup. It wasn’t. What most of these people missed, or deliberately chose to ignore, was how this controversy tore the tendons of the relationship and damaged the muscles that held the joints together. The limbs were not severed, but the internal damage had taken its toll. Is taking its toll. But not in any overt and orchestrated way. The coldness inside the Red Zone is less a result of a sudden gush of arctic air, and more of a gradual lessening of warmth due to the reconfiguration of the thermostat. The KP debacle is one manifestation of these changed realities. There were a host of reasons why PTI got such a drubbing on its home ground, but one key one — according to insiders — was the fact that the PTI did not get active support from places it used to get it. There was a “hands off” policy that let the political stakeholders slug it out on their own without any backing, assistance or facilitation. 
“Imagine what will happen to the PTI in the Punjab local government polls,” remarked a gleeful PML-N parliamentarian from Lahore. “We are waiting for them.” 
The “hands off” policy is now making its impact not just in KP but in Punjab and in Islamabad. Conversations with relevant officials and politicians have confirmed that this policy shift is under way. At the very senior level in the institution, decision-makers are stepping back from political entanglements to a fairly significant extent. The pendulum is slowly swinging back towards the centre. And those who need to read these signals are reading them like an unputdownable book. 
One such man sits in London. Party insiders are now acknowledging quietly that he has softened his position, and that he is willing to engage in a dialogue that can lead to the end of the present National Assembly and fresh elections immediately thereafter. These are sensitive issues in critical times and there are multiple dialogues under way at multiple levels by multiple players. There is a hush within the opposition camp because they know what may be cooking. Former president Asif Zardari did utter some uncharacteristically provocative remarks that may suggest some hiccups in the process of stitching up a fresh political matrix, but according to many opposition sources, the process remains on track for now. And the timeline does not go beyond a few months. 
The KP shocker has given this matrix fresh space. If the roots are coming loose, the branches can hold for only so long. The dire straits of the economy have now started to extract a tangible political cost. In Punjab, the ruling party legislators are getting restless and edgy. They can sniff the wind and smell the whiff of trouble. Some have started to flirt with the PML-N. January and February will weigh heavy around the PTI’s neck. 
Which is why the PML-N is also on course to cool down its internal war of narratives and present a more unified public stance. Red Zone insiders believe that prospects of party president Shehbaz Sharif’s nomination as the prime ministerial candidate are becoming likelier by the day. “We need to strike when the iron is hot,” says a former PML-N minister. He believes the party is finally, even though belatedly, getting its act together to take advantage of the situation that has developed since October. 
The month of March has started to figure in more and more conversations. Some ruling party legislators also feel that the moment of reckoning is drawing near. Few know when it will happen, and how it will happen but the situation is sliding towards some conclusion. Some very well-connected insiders believe big strategic decisions may have already been taken and now the operational details are being worked out. 
And yet — to whip an already tired cliché — there’s many a slip between the cup and the lip. The PTI sits atop the official pyramid and the vast resources that come with it. Its top leadership has access to information that keeps it abreast of what is simmering around the Red Zone. It too is strategising its moves, knowing that time is finite and the clock is ticking. It is not sitting on its hands. 
As the air gets colder, the nights longer and the mood darker, rivals know that time is upon them to unsheathe their swords and plunge into yet another year of political bloodletting.

1,"PPP has master plan to develop country, says Zardari",Claims he had made historic achievements that the other rulers had not been able to do when they were in power.,"DADU: Lashing out at the Centre for its wrong policies, former president and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari has said the country’s economy has suffered huge losses during the present government’s tenure, which it has never witnessed over the past 70 years, des­pite having natural resou­rces like gas, coal and oil.  
He said the PPP had prepared a master plan to develop the country as the party would soon come into power. Pakistan would prosper and flourish under this plan and cities, towns and rural areas of the country would be developed and basic amenities provided.  
Mr Zardari claimed that Sindh had the potential and capacity to run the country, adding that whenever the PPP came to power, people thought they were in power.  
He said the PPP always claimed to do small things but made big achievements. Giving an example, the former president said that after coming to power in 2008, he had not made any claim to bring the 18th Constitution Amendment, but he did so, besides providing rights to Balochistan and renaming NWFP as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.  
Mr Zardari said that had he claimed to achieve all these things earlier, he would not have been allowed to come to power. He claimed that he had made historic achievements which the other rulers had not been able to do when they were in power.  
Without naming Prime Minister Imran Khan or his government, the PPP leader said they were not running the country properly, adding that the slogan of change had destroyed the country and its economy. The PPP would protect Pakistan from this destruction because this is “our country”, he added.

2,PM Imran gives APPNA representation in health task force,Help desk to be set up in investment board to facilitate health professionals.,"• Help desk to be set up in investment board to facilitate health professionals
• PM inaugurates work on new model shelter homes 
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday announced that the Association of Physicians of Pakistani-descent of North America (APPNA) would be given representation in the National Task Force on Health. 
The task force is led by the prime minister himself. 
Mr Khan also directed that a help desk be established in the Board of Investment to facilitate health professionals. 
He issued these directives during a meeting with an APPNA delegation, led by Dr Rizwan Khalid. Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health Dr Faisal Sultan was also present on the occasion. 
PM Khan appreciated the contribution of the APPNA in America’s health sector and suggested that the association play its role in bringing investment to Pakistan for the betterment of the health sector. 
The delegation’s members appreciated the government’s strategy to control the Covid-19 pandemic as well as the decisions to give voting right and online system for power of attorney to overseas Pakistanis. 
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Khan on Wednesday inaugurated construction work on new model shelter homes (Panagahs) that would provide lodging and meals to the shelterless people and daily-wage earners. He also issued special directives to ensure quality structures with all facilities at the shelter homes.  
Unveiling the final plans of multi-storey Panagahs to be built in the federal capital, the prime minister lauded the Ehsaas team, Capital Development Authority, National College of Arts (NCA) and all those concerned for their collaborative efforts. 
He underlined the importance of providing quality food and service at Panagahs and asked the relevant departments to provide Ehsaas services at the shelter homes. 
He also emphasised the need for providing skill development training to enable the Panagah residents to become contributing citizens to society.  
The prime minister appreciated the collective efforts of the departments concerned and directed them to replicate the model in the provinces. 
Earlier, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Poverty Alleviation Dr Sania Nishtar briefed the prime minister on the Panagahs’ new strategic plan, including construction, furnishing, governance, execution, digital monitoring, capacity building and financing.  
“In addition to ‘bed, breakfast and meals’, these shelter homes will also have Ehsaas one-window centres to enable labourers and the underprivileged class to benefit from the government’s social welfare programmes,” Dr Nishtar said. 
The CDA provided land at concessional rates to the Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety Division for the purpose after the cabinet’s approval. The new Panagahs are being built in Tarlai, Tarnol, G-9 and Mandi Mor areas of Islamabad. 
Ehsaas has collaborated with the NCA Lahore to redesign the structure of model Panagahs and furniture.  
The new design of Panagahs incorporates bigger kitchen, cold storage, reception, lobby, waiting areas and enhanced capacity to offer food and shelter to those in need. Serena Hotels are also collaborating with Ehsaas to ensure best lodging and quality food to the Panagah beneficiaries. 
In the first phase, the staff of all Panagahs in Islamabad is being trained on hospitality, food safety, hygiene, health safety, environment, housekeeping, exercising and regular monitoring of amenities.  
So far, Ehsaas has opened 27 Panagahs in different areas of the country, with five in Sindh, eight in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, seven in Balochistan, five in Islamabad and one each in Gilgit-Baltistan and Punjab. 
Under the umbrella of Ehsaas, these Panagahs offer one star plus bed and breakfast facility with meals, essentials, hygiene, laundry and security standards.

3,IHC sets Jan 20 for ITNE head’s appointment,Law and information ministries directed to file reply by next hearing.,"ISLAMABAD: Islamabad High Court (IHC) Chief Justice Athar Minallah directed the federal government on Wednesday to appoint the chairman of the Implementation Tribunal for Newspaper Employees (ITNE) by Jan 20. 
While hearing a case on journalists and media workers’ protection, job security and the implementation of the wage board, the IHC chief justice noted with concern that such an important post of the ITNE head had been lying vacant for several months. 
The court also sought a copy of the Protection of Journalists and Media Professionals Act by Jan 20, when the IHC will resume the hearing.  
The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and the Ministry of Law and Justice have also been directed to file a reply by the next date of hearing. 
Earlier, the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) wrote an application to the IHC chief justice which was later converted into a petition. 

Law and information ministries directed to file reply by next hearing

The ITNE registrar and senior journalist Mazhar Abbas, who was appointed as an amicus curiae (friend of the court), filed written reports before the court. 
Advocate Adil Aziz Qazi appeared on behalf of the PFUJ, while Barrister Umar Ijaz Gillani represented the Islamabad High Court Journalists Association. 
Chief Justice Minallah remarked that an independent editor contributes to press freedom. He also inquired about the international practice to ensure independence of media and protection of reporters. 
Senior journalist Hamid Mir, another amicus curiae in this case, informed the court that every country formulated a policy for press freedom in accordance with their respective laws. He said an editorial committee in every media house oversaw content. 
However, he said the owner of a media house or its chief editor was not responsible for content management, as this responsibility solely fell within the ambit of the editor. 
Mr Mir pointed out that the government excluded camerapersons and photographers from the category of journalists in the Journalist Protection Act. 
He said Section 6 of the Act on censorship suggested heavy fines for fake news without even defining what constituted fake news. 
Mr Mir argued that there was unannounced censorship in the country and in addition to the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority, unknown callers issued directives for censoring the programmes or content. 
Justice Minallah termed it a violation of Article 19 of the Constitution if the government could not ensure press freedom. 
The IHC chief justice asked the amici curiae for a proposal to stop the sacking of journalists due to external pressures, as it was against their fundamental rights. 
Mr Mir stressed the need for legislation to safeguard the interests and ensure the protection of jobs of outspoken journalists. 
He, however, pointed out that the service structure of journalists working in the print media was somehow protected and governed under relevant laws, but there was no legislation for the electronic media. 
In reply to a question about the wage board, the journalist replied that it fixed a minimum wage for the journalists and media workers of the print media, but it was not applicable to contractual employees.

5,ECP issues notice to minister over Bannu poll violence,JUI-F counsel tells ECP the minister had fled the polling station with election material,"ISLAMABAD: The Election Com­mission of Pakistan (ECP) on Wednesday issued notices to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Minister for Transport Shah Mohammad Khan and his brother and son over polling station violence in Bannu. 
An ECP bench headed by Chief Election Commis­sioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja was informed that the minister was directly involved in the violence. 
The nench was hearing a case relating to attacks on polling stations and abduction of polling staff in Bakakhel town of Bannu district during the recent local government polls. 
The district returning officer (DRO), returning officer (RO) and Bannu District Police Officer Shahid Imran were present during the hearing. 
Kamran Murtaza, the counsel for Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F), said the provincial minister along with armed men had fled the polling station with polling material. 

JUI-F counsel tells ECP the minister had fled the polling station with election material

“The provincial minister, his brother and son are directly involved in polling violence,” he alleged. 
The counsel said the police had registered a first information report (FIR) against unidentified individuals instead of the minister and his brother. 
Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja said it was a serious matter which would be taken to its logical conclusion.  
“If any government official is involved, action will be taken against him. If anyone tries to save the accused, he will not be spared,” he added. 
Reprimanding DPO Imran, the CEC wondered what could be worse than polling staff being abducted. 
“Abducting women from polling stations is a very serious matter,” Mr Raja said. 
When the CEC asked the RO if he had gone to the scene, the latter responded that he could not as he was alone in his office and the route was dangerous. 
In response to a question about security arrangements and whether it was a ‘no-go area’, DPO Imran said these polling stations had been declared sensitive and a request for 400 security personnel made, but only 300 personnel were provided. 
He said that no one was allowed to go to the sensitive polling stations without security personnel. 
The DPO said that 18 people had been arrested so far while some could not be apprehended. 
The CEC adjourned the hearing till December 28. 
The elections were held in 17 districts of KP on Sunday in the first phase of local government polls in the province. The elections were marred by various incidents of violence. 
The ruling PTI suffered a major setback after the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl’s candidate won the seat for the coveted post of Peshawar mayor in the first local government elections held in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa since the merger of tribal districts. 
The first phase of local government polls, marred by scattered incidents of violence and attacks that clai-med five lives and damage to some polling stations, was held on Sunday in 66 tehsils of 17 districts after a gap of six years. 
The polling in Swabi, Bannu and Darra Adam Khel was postponed due to disturbances, including a suicide bombing in Bajaur, abduction of polling staff in Bannu, a clash in Karak and a mob attack on Minister Shibli Faraz’s vehicle in Kohat. 
In all, 12.668 million voters — seven million male and five and a half million female — were registered for the polls in Buner, Bajaur, Swabi, Peshawar, Nowshera, Kohat, Karak, Dera Ismail Khan, Bannu, Tank, Haripur, Khyber, Mohmand, Mardan, Charsadda, Hangu and Lakki Marwat. 
The local government elections were held for the first time in Khyber, Mohmand and Bajaur districts of the erstwhile Fata.

7,Entry of PTM chief banned in AJK,"Ban has been imposed with immediate effect under Section 5 of the Maintenance of Public Order Act, 1985, for three months.","MUZAFFARABAD: The Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) government on Wednesday clamped a ban on Pashtoon Tahafuz Movement (PTM) leader Manzoor Ahmed Pashteen’s entry and speech in the territorial jurisdiction of the region. 
The AJK government’s move drew instant criticism from a former information minister belonging to opposition Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N).
According to a notification issued by the AJK home department, the ban was imposed on Mr Pashteen with immediate effect under section 5 of the Maintenance of Public Order Act, 1985, for three months.
Mr Pashteen was invited by a faction of National Students Federation, a pro-independence organisation, to address its convention in Kotli on Dec 25 as the chief guest.
Earlier in the day, at a press conference in Kotli, some activists of an obscure organisation by the name of Tehreek-i-Jawanan-Kashmir called upon the AJK government to ban the entry of Mr Pashteen “to arrest propagation of India-sponsored narratives in the territory”.
However, on social media many activists criticised the government’s embargo on freedom of speech and expression.
“We condemn the PTI government in strong words for banning Manzoor Pashteen’s entry and speech in Azad Kashmir. Imposing restrictions on freedom of expression and speech is a fascist practice. Manzoor Pashteen! We are ashamed,” tweeted Mushtaq Minhas, the former AJK information minister and member of the PML-N organising committee.

 



 
“Manzoor Pashteen is the voice of millions of people. Restricting his entry to Azad Jammu and Kashmir is the worst step. Notwithstanding political differences [with Mr Pashteen] we condemn such cowardly steps...,” tweeted Nasira Khan Sudhozai, a PML-N activist.
