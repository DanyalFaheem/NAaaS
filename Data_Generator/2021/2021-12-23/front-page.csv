0,Opposition in Senate berates govt for yielding to IMF,Warns against making State Bank of Pakistan answerable only to International Monetary Fund.,"• Warns against making SBP answerable only to International Monetary Fund
• Government rejects claim about bringing mini-budget through ordinance    
ISLAMABAD: Alleging that the government had signed a ‘document of financial surrender’ with the International Monetary Fund, the opposition in the Senate on Wednesday warned the former against making the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) answerable only to the IMF.  
Speaking on a point of public importance in the house, former Senate chairman and PPP stalwart Mian Raza Rabbani claimed that the cabinet had in its recent meeting deferred consideration of a ‘mini-budget bill’ and wanted to decide with the IMF to enforce it through an ordinance.  
He said the details of the agreement signed with the IMF had not been shared with either the public or parliament, but its fallout was visible in the form of a surge in power and gas tariff, besides increase in the prices of petrol and various other commodities.  
Mr Rabbani said all the more dangerous was the government’s plan to amend the SBP autonomy act. He said that under the proposed amendment, the SBP would go out of the government’s jurisdiction and would not be answerable to it or parliament. “It [SBP] will only be answerable to the IMF.”  
He regretted the attempts to make parliament irrelevant and said that be it a matter of national strategic importance or national economic decision, parliament was kept in the complete dark.  
The PPP senator declared that the opposition would resist the moves to introduce a mini-budget and blindly follow the IMF dictates. He also referred to Article 77 of the Constitution which reads: “No tax shall be levied for the purposes of the federation except by or under the authority of Majlis-i-Shoora (parliament).”  
Mr Rabbani said no meaningful discussion took place in parliament. He said when an agreement was reached with the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan, its details were promised to be shared within 10 days, but it had not been done so far. Likewise, he added, details of the agreement with the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan were also yet to be shared.  
Leader of the House in the Senate Dr Shahzad Waseem, in his response, refuted the reservations expressed by Senator Rabbani and wondered how the government could bring mini-budget through promulgation of ordinance when parliament was in session. He said the Senate would remain in session for a long period of time and “we should talk in the house on solid grounds”.  
He said the cabinet did not discuss the mini-budget and when it would be introduced, its details would be made public and discussed in parliament as well.  
Mr Waseem, while addressing Senator Rabbani, said the same was the case with the bill about State Bank of Pakistan. “Whether he [Raza Rabbani] has seen the document about this bill… Let the document come,” he said, adding that they should avoid talking on hypothesis.  
He took a swipe at the opposition and said they should know about the circumstances that forced the government to avail the IMF programme, adding that the government was trying that less burden should be passed on to the masses while remaining within the IMF programme.  
Mr Waseem blamed the previous government for pushing the country to the trap of debts. He said the PTI government had to return debts worth $55 billion and it had already returned $29bn over past three years while another over $12bn each would be returned this year and the next year.  
He said the last PML-N government had returned only $27bn during its five-year tenure and blamed the “mismanagement” of the previous governments for the bad economic conditions of the country.

1,Taliban stop Pakistani troops from fencing border,Taliban spokesman Bilal Karimi says the incident is being investigated.,"KABUL: Taliban soldiers in Afghanistan disrupted the erecting of a security fence by the Pakistani military along the border between the two countries, Afghan officials said on Wednesday.  
Pakistan has fenced most of the 2,600km border des­pite protestations from Kabul, which has contested the British-era boundary demarcation that splits families and tribes on either side.  
Afghan defence ministry spokesman Enayatullah Khwarazmi said Taliban forces stopped the Pakistani military from erecting what he called an “illegal” border fence along the eastern province of Nangarhar on Sunday.  
He played down the incident, saying everything was now normal. The Pakistan army did not respond to a request for comment.  
A video circulated on social media showed Taliban soldiers had seized spools of barbed wire and one senior official asking Pakistani soldiers stationed in security posts in the distance not to try to fence the border again. 
Reuters could not verify the video independently.  
Taliban spokesman Bilal Karimi said they were investigating the incident.  
Taliban and Pakistani forces came face-to-face over the border incident, two Taliban officials said on condition of anonymity, and the situation was tense.  
They added that following the incident there was cross-border mortar fire from Pakistani territory further north along the frontier into Afghanistan’s Kunar province on Wednesday.  
It was unclear if the incidents are linked. The officials said Afghan military helicopters could be seen patrolling the area.  
The fencing was a main reason behind the souring of relations between previous US-backed Afghan governments and Islamabad. The current standoff indicates the issue remains a contentious matter for the Taliban, despite its close ties to Islamabad.  
Foreign governments have long alleged that Pakistan supported the insurgent movement as it fought the US-backed government and Western troops — a charge Islamabad denies.  
The lawless mountainous border was historically fluid before Pakistan began erecting a metal fence four years ago, of which it has completed 90 per cent.  
The border incident happened the day foreign delegates from around the world gathered in Islamabad for a summit of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation to discuss the unfolding humanitarian disaster in Afghanistan.

2,PM Imran grills KP CM over ‘wrong’ selection of contestants,Premier will sensitise party leaders in Punjab to select best possible candidates and prepare well for local government polls.,"• Receives report on PTI’s defeat in its stronghold
• Likely to sensitise Punjab leaders over selection
• Lawmaker says villagers unwilling to receive PTI ticket
• Fawad hopes for better candidates for next phase of LG polls    
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday received a brief report on the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s (PTI) defeat in the recent local government polls in its stronghold, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, indicating ‘wrong’ selection of candidates based on ‘favouritism’. 
During his visit to Lahore on Thursday (today), the premier will sensitise party leaders in Punjab to select best possible candidates and prepare well for the local government polls, which are expected to be held in the province in March or April next year. 
Mr Khan is likely to preside over PTI’s core committee meeting on Friday or Saturday in which the root cause of its defeat in the KP province where the party has been ruling for nearly a decade will be determined. 
A source in the Prime Minister Office (PMO) told Dawn that the performance report was presented by KP Chief Minister Mehmood Khan who was also grilled by Mr Khan for not fielding ‘deserving’ and ‘poll-winning’ candidates. 
A day after blaming ‘wrong selection of candidates’ for PTI’s defeat in KP polls, the prime minister said amidst all the noise over the election result, nobody appreciated the fact that the government had empowered LG system for the first time in 74-year history of Pakistan. Local government elections in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were the start of a modern, devolved local government system as exists in successful democracies, the PM tweeted on Wednesday. “Directly elected Tehsil nazims will improve governance & create future leader. Ist time in our 74-yr history we have an empowered LG system,” he wrote. 

 



 
However, PTI lawmaker Noor Alam Khan, who returned to the National Assembly in 2013 and 2018 from Peshawar, told a TV show that the ‘wrong’ selection of candidates could not be blamed for the ruling party’s defeat in KP. 
The MNA said people in villages were unwilling to even receive PTI tickets due to government’s poor performance. “We visited rural areas but were unable to convince people to contest the polls on PTI ticket,” he said, adding that price hike and unemployment were major factors behind it.  
The government could not be run by Twitter and social media accounts only, the PTI lawmaker said, adding that he had been highlighting the problems being faced by the people without any positive outcome. He said he had to prove himself innocent before the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in an assets beyond means case after he had raised the issues that people at the grassroots level had been facing.  
He believed the result of the second phase of the KP polls would not be different if the real issues were not addressed within two weeks. However, he denied that he and other like-minded MNAs were going to support any no-confidence motion against the prime minister. 
When contacted, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said the PTI failed to clinch top slots in the LG polls but it secured majority seats at village council level.  
“This shows that the graph of the PTI has not declined,” he asserted. 
He said the ruling party had learnt a lesson from the first phase of the LG polls in KP and would field better candidates in the second phase [ of polls scheduled to be held in KP from Jan 16]. 
According to the provisional results of 39 of the 63 tehsils declared by the Election Commission of Pakistan on Monday, the JUI-F not only won 15 seats of mayor/chairman but also gave a tough fight in many other tehsils where its candidates stood as runners-up. 
In the provincial capital, the JUI-F stunned the PTI with a definitive lead in the contest for the mayor of Peshawar city. JUI-F candidate Haji Zubair Ali secured 62,388 votes against 50,659 votes secured by PTI’s Rizwan Bangash. 
Of the remaining six tehsil chairman seats of Peshawar, the JUI-F managed to win four while the PTI could get one seat of tehsil chairman. 
Fawad had earlier termed the JUI-F lead a victory of “extremist religious-political party” and called it “unfortunate” and “harmful for the country”. 
Agriculture
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Khan presided over a separate meeting on kharif crops, which was attended by all provincial agriculture ministers via video link. 
The premier directed the authorities concerned to make all-out efforts to improve the acreage and yield of all crops to ensure food security in the country. He said the government was focused on introducing better farming techniques and investing in research to produce better quality inputs like seeds and fertilizers. 
Mr Khan was apprised that growth trend was being witnessed in the per acre yield of all major crops due to agriculture-friendly policies of the government. 
STZA: In a meeting of the board of governors of Special Technology Zones Authority (STZA), PM Khan said: “Technology must be leveraged upon to not only earn foreign exchange but to recover from the current account deficit.”  
He called for steps to ensure ease of doing business to attract more Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in IT. 
Earlier, the premier was apprised that an investment of Rs520 million had been committed in different projects in Islamabad Technopolis, Karachi and Lahore Special Technology Zones under the STZA. 
Ties with Norway
The premier during his meeting with ambassador of Norway, Per Albert Ilsaas, said Pakistan and Norway had excellent relations and highlighted that Norwegians of Pakistani-origin formed a strong bridge between the two countries. He said there was potential for increased collaboration in political, economic and other areas of mutual interest. 
Referring to the Norwegian telecom company, Telenor, Mr Khan said Pakistan-Norway economic relations were growing. 
Extending greetings on behalf of Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store, whose party won the parliamentary election in September, the ambassador also felicitated PM Khan on successful holding of the 17th extraordinary session of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation’s Council of Foreign Ministers (OIC-CFM).  
PM Khan also extended an invitation to the Norwegian prime minister to undertake a visit to Pakistan at his earliest convenience.

3,IHC examining adjutant general’s power to cancel plot allotment,Petitioner alleges DHA cancelled allotment without legal backing.,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) is examining powers of the adjutant general (AG) of the General Headquarters to cancel allotment of plots and freeze properties in the Defence Housing Authority (DHA).  
The question of the AG’s power, who is the president of the DHA by virtue of his post, to cancel allotment of plots and place caution on the properties in the military- controlled housing scheme has been raised on a petition filed by former secretary of DHA retired Col Ejaz Hussain.  
Mr Hussain, after his retirement from service in December 2012, was appointed as secretary in DHA Islamabad-Rawalpindi commonly known DHAI-R on a contract basis for three years from December 2012 till November 2015. However, his contract was extended on a yearly basis from December 2015 to August 2019.  
During the service in the DHA, he obtained two plots. He said that other office-bearers of the DHAI-R were also allotted plots in the housing scheme.  

Petitioner alleges DHA cancelled allotment without legal backing      

However, the authority refused to give him no objection certificate in 2019 when Mr Hussain intended to sell the two plots.  
Upon query, he learnt that allotment of his plots had been cancelled and properties owned by him and his family members had been placed under caution and they could not transfer ownership of properties.  
In his petition, Mr Hussain has nominated the AG, director general, Rehabilitation and Works Directorate of the GHQ and administrator and secretary of the DHAI-R as respondents.  
According to the petitioner, “imposing ban /caution/forfeiture of property/attachment of property/cancellation of property in not under the purview/jurisdiction of DHAI-R”. The petition says that the DHA can cancel allotment of a plot after completing the codal formalities and giving a proper opportunity of hearing to an allottee as prescribed in Section 17 of the DHAI-R Act, 2013.  
It says that the investigation agencies like National Accountability Bureau and Anti-Narcotics Force and Federal Board of Revenue have been empowered under their respective statutes to attach or place caution on properties through court for a limited time but the DHA placed his and family members’ properties under caution without any legal backing.  
During the course of hearing of the case, the lawyer representing the DHA told the IHC that the management of the housing authority did not attach the properties on its own, but a letter issued by the AG ordered so.  
Initially, the GHQ was not cited as respondent in this matter. However, after these revelations, the court asked the petitioner to implead it as a necessary party.  
According to the counsel representing the GHQ, Mr Hussain was facing an inquiry in connection with irregular approval of a commercial plaza.  
Mr Hussain’s counsel Raja Inam Ameen Minhas argued that the GHQ and the DHA were working in accordance with the Pakistan Army Act and the Defence Housing Authority Act, respectively. He said that under the law, the military authorities could not initiate an inquiry against a retired army official working in another organisation unless he was involved in certain crimes like espionage or inciting an army official to sedition.  
The IHC division bench comprising Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz heard the matter and adjourned further hearing till second week of February.

4,Supreme Court rules against public reprimand of judges,Expunges strictures passed against two district judges by LHC.,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court has observed that public condemnation of a judge not only harms the morale and confidence of the judge and his colleagues, but also lowers public trust in the judicial institution. 
Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah made this observation while expunging strictures passed against two district judges by the Lahore High Court (LHC). The LHC while deciding appeals against the judicial orders of the two judges held that their conduct in a particular case prima facie seemed to be ‘dubious’ and passed strictures against them on June 22. 
The judges approached the apex court for the redressal of their grievance against the stricture and direction passed by the LHC. They argued that the impugned strictures and directions passed against them were in derogation of the principles enunciated by the SC in the 2019 Nusrat Yasmin case and urged the court to expunge them. 

Expunges strictures passed against two district judges by LHC 

In his verdict, Justice Shah wrote: “Public reprimand of a judge of the lower court regarding his judicial conduct by an appellate court while sitting over his or her judicial decision, either by recording a stricture or a censorious remark in its appellate judgement or by summoning the judge and reproaching him orally in the open court, does not behove the judiciary of a constitutional democracy which boasts of the independence of a judiciary as its salient pillar.”   
Every judge of the courts of this land — from the highest to the lowest — should be protected, the SC observed, adding that this immunity applied to every judge to ensure that judges remained free in thought and independent in their judgements. 
Justice Shah also recalled the principles enunciated in the Nusrat Yasmin case, which highlights that an appellate court should not pass strictures relating to his efficiency or conduct, in its judgement against the judge of the lower court whose judgement or order was impugned before it. 
Likewise, the appellate court should not summon in court the judge of the lower court whose judgement or order was impugned before it and in case of procedural errors or irregularities in the proceedings, may bring the same to the notice of the judge concerned through a confidential note, separate from its judgement. 
These principles also stated that if the appellate court considered that a judge of lower court had exhibited grave inefficiency or committed serious misconduct in discharge of his judicial duty that warranted disciplinary action, it may inform the competent authority or the officer appointed by the competent authority to deal with such complaints through a confidential report. The authority or the officer concerned is to deal with such confidential report and proceed with it as per the relevant service laws, rules and instructions. 
Calling lower judiciary the backbone of the country’s judicial system, the SC noted that district judges performed onerous task of dispensing justice at the frontline by dealing with a huge number of cases in a difficult and demanding environment. The judges of higher courts must appreciate the stressful and challenging conditions in which they work, the SC verdict added.  
According to the SC judgement, the judicial system acknowledges the fallibility of judges and hence provides for appeals and revisions. The higher courts everyday come across lower courts orders which are not justified either in law or in fact and modify or set them aside. This was the function of an appellate court, the judgement highlighted, adding it was often said a judge who had not committed an error was yet to be born. “This applies to all judges, no matter how high or low in rank they maybe,” it stated. 
As intemperate or extravagant criticism on the ability of a person having a contrary view was often founded on one’s sense of his own infallibility, this must be avoided and the judicial approach should always be based on the consciousness that everyone may make a mistake, Justice Shah said.  
While examining the decision of a court below, the higher court was to assess the reasoning and the legality of the decision challenged before it and not the ability or conduct of the author judge, he said, explaining that the latter was disciplinary authority’s function. The higher court could, however, refer the matter to the disciplinary authority in the manner elucidated in Nusrat Yasmin case, only on the administrative side, the judgement contended. 
“Unless we wish anarchy to prevail within the judicial system, a precedent of the apex court of the country must be followed by all other courts which owe unflinching fealty to its decisions under the constitution,” Justice Shah observed. 
He said ignoring or refusing to follow the controlling precedent (Nusrat Yasmin case) of the Supreme Court amounted to judicial effrontery, offended the constitutional mandate, and weakened the public confidence in the decisions of the apex court of the country. 
In the end, the SC expunged the strictures passed against the district judges with an observation that the LHC judge should act in accordance with the principles settled in the cited precedents if deemed it necessary.

5,Ecnec approves four uplift projects worth Rs265bn,Projects include the six-lane Hyderabad-Sukkur Motorway.,"

ISLAMABAD: Shaukat Tarin, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance, chairing the Ecnec meeting on Wednesday.—PPI

 
ISLAMABAD: The Executive Committee of National Economic Council (Ecnec) on Wednesday approved four development projects worth over Rs265 billion, including the construction of Hyderabad-Sukkur Motorway (M6) on build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis.  
The Ecnec meeting was presided over by Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance and Revenue Shaukat Tarin. The meeting approved the revised project of construction of Hyderabad-Sukkur Motorway on the BOT basis at a cost of Rs191.471bn. The project is to be executed by the National Highway Authority and envisages construction of 306km, 6-lane, fenced motorway between Hyderabad and Sukkur.  
The project would be included in the next federal budget and is expected to be completed in 30 months. The project was cleared by the Central Development Working Party (CDWP) in April and subsequently approved by Ecnec in May at a cost of Rs191.46bn with observation to address certain deficiencies. The project cost, in the meanwhile, slightly increased to Rs191.47bn.  

Projects include six-lane Hyderabad-Sukkur Motorway   

The project is to be implemented on the BOT user-charge basis with the provision of significantly higher financial contribution by the federal government through a capital and operational viability gap fund to improve the financial viability of the project.  
As of April 12, the Public-Private Partnership Authority (P3A) was proposing Rs76bn government funding, or almost 39 per cent share, which was later increased to almost 50pc. The BOT is practically now on 50:50 shareholding from the public and private sectors.  
The P3A board of directors had approved the provision of Rs92bn from the budget and through toll charges to make the Hyderabad-Sukkur Motorway project financially viable and attractive for private parties.  
Earlier, the government was seeking execution of the project without budget support and wanted it to be fully funded by the private sector which did not come up with the response the government was anticipating when the BOT model was originally finalised and approved in January and March last year, respectively. At that time, the government’s original share was put at Rs1.1bn, or 0.7pc.  
Ecnec also approved two road projects worth around Rs48.57bn for Rawalpindi. The first project ‘Land Acquisition for Lai Expressway & Flood Channel, Rawalpindi’ was approved at a cost of Rs24.961bn. The committee directed that no expenditure should be incurred till completion of the environmental impact assessment (EIA) report and approval of the project from the PPP board.  
The project will be executed by the Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) and envisages acquisition of 750 Kanals of land to provide right of way for construction of Lai Nullah Expressway and flood channel which would constitute an integral part of transportation network of Rawalpindi besides serving the purposes of flood mitigation and sewage disposal.  
The second project for Rawalpindi approved by Ecnec was the controversial ‘Construction of Rawalpindi Ring Road (R3), main carriageway from Baanth (N-5) to Thallian (M-2)’ at an estimated cost of Rs23.606bn. The committee also directed authorities concerned to acquire the concurrence of the Planning Commission and inclusion of axle load management in the project.  
The provincial annual development plan of Punjab will finance the project and the RDA will execute the project for construction of 38.3km, 6-lane, access-controlled Rawalpindi ring road.   
The project had earlier led to a major scandal involving some PTI leaders on the basis of which Prime Minister Imran Khan had sacked some of his aides and some senior government officials.  
The meeting also approved revised Southern Punjab Poverty Alleviation Project at a cost of Rs25.243bn. Contributions from the International Fund for Agriculture Development and the Punjab government will fund the project spread over 10 districts of Punjab.  
The meeting also discussed Greater Thal Canal Project (Phase-II) but deferred a decision on it with observations to discuss it in the next meeting after considering the technical aspect of the project, inclusion of comments of Sindh in the CDWP report and addressing reservations of all stakeholders, an official statement said.  
The meeting was attended by Minister for Planning Asad Umar, Minister for Industries Makhdoom Khusro Bakhtiar, Minister for Energy Hammad Azhar, Adviser to the PM on Commerce and Investment Abdul Razak Dawood, Punjab Minister for Irrigation Mohsin Leghari and federal secretaries and other senior officers from federal and provincial governments.
