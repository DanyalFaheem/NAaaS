The Italy winger drilled a shot into the far corner in the 83rd minute to celebrate his first league goal since July 26 2020, a run of 513 days.
It came after Moise Kean headed home the opener in the first half to set Juve on course for a victory that extends second-bottom Cagliari’s winless league run to 11 matches. 
The Old Lady climbed into fifth place on 34 points, within four points of fourth-placed Atalanta, who were surprisingly held to a 0-0 draw at struggling Genoa. 
Massimiliano Allegri’s side can now enjoy a two-week winter break but when they return in 2022, Juve face league clashes with Napoli, AS Roma and AC Milan in January, before facing Atalanta on Feb 12. 
“It is fun when you get to these moments in the season. We have done well in the last few games but January is an important month,” Allegri told DAZN. “I would be happy to get to the end of February with this distance from the teams at the top, because between now and then we have to play all the top teams. Then they will face each other and we will have a better fixture schedule.” 
Kean started in the absence of injured top-scorer Paulo Dybala and provided Juve’s greatest threat in the first half, thumping a header off the post from a Juan Cuadrado cross after 10 minutes. 
The 21-year-old made the breakthrough when a Bernardeschi shot was deflected into his path and he reacted quickly to head the ball back across goal and beyond goalkeeper Alessio Cragno. 
Cagliari threatened after the break and saw two big chances go begging, as Dalbert skewed a finish wide from six yards before Joao Pedros powerful header was palmed over by Wojciech Szczesny. 
The visitors were made to pay for their profligacy when Bernardeschi fired home a pass from Dejan Kulusevski. 
Elsewhere, Genoa coach Andriy Shevchenko claimed the second league point of his tenure in his seventh game as the 18th-placed side surprisingly held Atalanta. 
The Bergamo side, who are fourth, mustered 17 shots to Genoas one, but could not find a way past goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu. 
Salernitana’s match at Udinese was not officially postponed but it could not take place because of a coronavirus outbreak at the visiting club. 
Salernitana were blocked by local health authorities from traveling to Udine after at least two members of the team tested positive for Covid-19. 
The match was eventually abandoned 45 minutes after the official kick-off time of 1830 local time (1730 GMT), with the Udinese players remaining in the Dacia Arena’s dressing rooms knowing their opposition was not going to show up. 
Salernitana now await the ruling from the football authorities regarding the result and whether the match will be rescheduled. 
However the head of the Italian FA said on Tuesday that they will be kicked out of Serie A if a buyer for the club is not found by December 31, as they are owned by Lazio chief Claudio Lotito and ownership of multiple clubs in the same division is not allowed.

1,Nketiah treble fires Arsenal into League Cup semis,"LONDON: Even after scoring a hat-trick for Arsenal, Eddie Nketiah was momentarily upstaged by another academy...","LONDON: Even after scoring a hat-trick for Arsenal, Eddie Nketiah was momentarily upstaged by another academy graduate. It’s not often a teenager scores on his debut. 
Eleven minutes after coming off the bench, Charlie Patino completed a 5-1 victory over Sunderland to send Arsenal into the semi-finals of the League Cup on Tuesday.
The stoppage-time goal at Emirates Stadium saw the 18-year-old midfielder prod in a shot after Nicolas Pepe rolled the ball into the penalty area. 
Pepe was also Arsenal’s second scorer in the first half after Nketiah netted the opener from close range in the 17th minute against the third-tier side.
After Nathan Broadhead pulled one back, Nketiah’s back-heeled flick restored Arsenal’s two-goal advantage four minutes into the second half. Nketiah completed his treble in the 58th minute after getting on the end of Pepe’s cross. 
The forward, whose contract at Arsenal runs out in June, has scored 10 goals in nine career appearances in the League Cup. 
“This competition is the place I’ve been getting starts. I’ll do my best whenever I’m asked to play,” said Nketiah, who has yet to agree any contract extension. “I’m desperate to play football. All I can do is keep working hard. It’ll sort itself out. As long as I play for Arsenal I’ll give my all.” 
It’s another encouraging result for Arsenal, who are fourth in the Premier League as they try to end a five-season exile from the Champions League. 
“When you win football matches everything looks much better,” manager Mikel Arteta said. “We have to be consistent with the decisions that we make, keep trying to improve all the time the way we play, perform better and better and the results will come. They are coming right now and now it is about consistency. There are a lot of games coming up and we want to maintain that form.”

Playing under heavy rain, a much-improved Barca desperately tried to score a second goal after Ronald Araujo drew them level with a header in the 45th minute but they were thwarted by an equally determined Sevilla, who were reduced to 10 men after Jules Kounde was shown a straight red card in the 64th. 
Sevilla went ahead in the 32nd minute after Papu Gomez latched on to a Ivan Rakitic corner kick and fired home a low strike. 
Barca are seventh in standings with 28 points from 18 games, 15 points behind leaders Real Madrid. 
“I honestly think that today we lost two points. We played better and deserved to win. I feel that is evident in our improvement,” Barca manager Xavi Hernandez told reporters. 
“We were unlucky. They score in a set piece play but we had many more opportunities. The result, a draw away against a great team like Sevilla, is not bad. But it is a point that is not enough for us as we are trying to move up in contention. We let this win slip away from our hands.” 
Barca dominated the first half, had more ball control and could have scored at least twice in the first 30 minutes. 
But Sevilla made the most of the single opportunity that came their way in the first half, with Gomez firing home a powerful strike. 
Sevilla improved in the second half but then had to switch to damage-limitation mode after Kounde was sent off for a petulant display following a clash with Jordi Alba in the touchline. After being pushed by the Barca defender, Kounde hurled the ball straight into Alba’s face. 
“It was a very complicated game and the red card caught us when we were playing our best. Kounde knows that he made a mistake,” Sevilla manager Julen Lopetegui told reporters.  
Gerard Moreno and Boulaye Dia both scored braces to lead Villarreal to a 5-2 win over Alaves. 
Moreno’s first goal to open the scoring culminated a superb team buildup. Alaves rallied to pull level at 2-2 from goals by Pere Pons and Joselu Mato, but Dia, Yeremy Pino and Moreno turned it into a rout.

4,"Australian Open chief confident on Nadal, uncertain on Djokovic","Reiterates that all players, staff at Australian Open will be vaccinated or have a medical exemption granted by experts.","MELBOURNE: Australian Open chief Craig Tiley is confident Rafa Nadal will be at Melbourne Park for next month’s Grand Slam despite testing positive for Covid-19, but he is still uncertain whether Novak Djokovic will be playing.
Nadal caught the novel coronavirus while playing in an exhibition tournament in Abu Dhabi last week and said he would make a decision on his future tournaments depending on his  “evolution” over the weeks ahead.
“I’m confident Rafa will be here,” tournament organiser Tiley said of the 20-time Grand Slam champion at Melbourne Park on Wednesday.
“Players that are testing positive now will complete a period of time until they are no longer infectious and they will be fine. If you are going to test positive and you want to play the Australian Open, your timing would be now.”
Tiley reiterated that all players and staff at the Australian Open would be vaccinated or have a medical exemption granted by an independent panel of experts.
Those requirements have prevented Djokovic, who has declined to disclose whether he is vaccinated, citing privacy, from confirming whether he will bid for a 21st Grand Slam title and a 10th Australian Open crown next month.
Tiley said that as far as he was aware, no players had yet been granted medical exemptions and that it would be up to Djokovic to disclose the grounds on which he gained entry to Australia.
“If Novak shows up at the Australian Open, he’ll either be vaccinated or he’ll have a medical exemption,” he added.
“Medically, he doesn’t talk to anyone about it. I’m not going to ask Novak that, it’s none of my business.
“I will know that [he fulfils] one of those conditions.”
Tiley said that if the world number one was going to play for Serbia in the ATP Cup in Sydney in the first week of January then he would be arriving with the first tranche of players next week.
“We want to have the best players here, I’d love to have Novak here,” he added.  “If he meets those conditions then great, if not, it’s disappointing.”
Roger Federer, the other men’s player with 20 Grand Slam titles, and Serena Williams, who has won 23 Grand Slam titles, have already ruled themselves out of the tournament as they continue their recoveries from injury.
Tiley also announced that former US Open champion Sam Stosur and her fellow Australians Daria Saville and Maddy Inglis had been granted wildcards for the women’s singles draw at the Jan. 17-30 tournament.

Honda said Marquez has made  “periodic visits to an ophthalmologist to assess the evolution of his vision over the past two months.”  “The progress made has been deemed favorable and as a result Marquez will continue with a conservative treatment plan for the next few weeks,” Honda added in a statement on their website.
Marquez has been suffering from double vision since an off-road training crash at the end of October.
The 28-year-old six-time MotoGP world champion missed the final two rounds of the season and the Jerez test session in December.
“The situation does not prevent the rider from continuing his physical training plan to prepare himself physically for a new season,” Honda said.
Marquez missed the entire 2020 season and the first few races of 2021 due to a serious injury to his right arm sustained in a race crash.
Despite continue weakness in the arm, he won three races to finish sixth in the World Championship.
He had already suffered a bout of double vision early in his career following a crash at the Malaysian GP in Moto2 in 2011 which forced him to end his season.

Wellbrock, who won gold in the 10km open water event at the Tokyo Olympics, clocked 14:06.88 on Tuesday to better Gregorio Paltrinieri’s mark of 14:08.065.
“Since I’ve always preferred long course, earlier this year I did not think of breaking the world record here as honestly I had ridiculous times in short course,” Wellbrock said.
“I think my personal best was almost identical with my long course top time. Then, I had a really good race in Kazan [at the European short course championships], where I clocked 14:09.88 and from that point I knew anything was possible here.”
The German won a bronze medal in the men’s 1,500m freestyle in the Tokyo pool this year.
Wellbrock’s world record was the fourth of the meet after Margaret MacNeil in the women’s 50m backstroke, Siobhan Haughey in the women’s 200m freestyle and Sweden’s women equalling the Americans’ mark in the 450m medley relay.
The US topped the medal charts with nine golds (30 total medals), followed by Canada with seven golds (15) and Italy with five (16).

10,"Korea edge Japan to win maiden ACT title, India overcome Pakistan to finish third",India-Pakistan match went down to the wire with both teams going full throttle against each other trying to stamp their authority.,"DHAKA: South Korea stamped their authority as a potent force in field hockey on Wednesday when they defeated Japan in shootout in a thrilling final of the sixth Asian Champions Trophy here at the Maulana Bhashani Hockey Stadium.
This is South Korea’s maiden Asian Champions Trophy title. Arch-rivals Pakistan and India, the two erstwhile major world hockey powers, besides winning the title twice each shared the trophy in the fifth edition staged in Muscat in 2018 The scoreline read 3-3 in regulation time.
South Korea’s Jeong Junwoo broke the deadlock scoring in the eighth minute of the game. Japan equalised through Ken Nagayoshi in the 24th minute. Japan then moved ahead 3-1 thanks to goals by Ryoma Ooka in the 29th minute and Yoshika Kirishita (38th).
In a magnificent comeback, South Korea through Jang Jonghyun reduced the deficit to 3-2 in the 55th minute, and then scored another goal — this time on penalty corner -- just a few seconds before the final hooter. 
The nail-biting match then went onto penalty strokes where Japan’s Raiki Fujishima missed the first penalty while the second was successfully taken by Ryoma Ooka but then again third one was missed by Kosei Kawabe.
The last penalty was scored by Seren Tanaka but it was too late.
South Korea scored on all their attempts. Lee Jungjun, Ji Woo Cheon, Hwang Taeli and Lee Hyeseung were the scorers.Jang Jong-Hyun was the top scorer of the tournament with 10 goals.
Earlier on Wednesday, India edged past Pakistan 4-3 in another exciting finish to secure bronze medal.
Rana Abdul Waheed scored Pakistan’s second goal as India went behind 2-1 in the third quarter. India however gathered momentum and took a crucial 3-2 lead in the final quarter through Varun Kumar on a penalty corner after Gursahibjit Singh brought India in the game as he scored the equaliser at the stroke of the fourth quarter with the score level at 2-2.
The match went down to the wire with both team going full throttle against each other in order to stamp their authority. India started on a bright note after Harmanpreet Singh scored from the penalty corner earlier which helped India take a 1-0 lead in the first quarter. However, Pakistan’s Afraz equalised for his team soon and brought the game to equal terms.
Eventually Akashdeep Singh scored India’s final goal to put them ahead 4-2 and within touching distance of a medal. Pakistan’s third goal went in vain as India ended the tournament at the third place.
Earlier, India had crashed to a shocking 3-5 defeat against Japan in the semi-final, despite finishing the round-robin stage with a perfect record. Pakistan had lost to South Korea in their semi-final in a 5-6 thriller.

11,"Ramiz assures England, Australia and NZ will tour Pakistan with top players","“We have made the world realise about our presence at the International Cricket Council meetings,” Ramiz Raja said.","KARACHI: Times were so turbulent after Ramiz Raja was elected Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman that he feels he’s aged 30 years in his three months in the job. 
Things have calmed down since and as Pakistan looks ahead to an exciting cricketing year, the former captain vowed he will leave no stone unturned in bringing about the game’s renaissance in the country. 
He spoke about breaking barriers, that the recent highs were just a pit-stop and about dealing with the pressure of his own expectations. 
“There is a still a lot of work to do,” Ramiz told a news conference here on Wednesday, a day after the meeting of the PCB Board of Governors.  
“The upcoming season is the real test,” he added, with Aust­ralia, England and New Zealand all set to tour the country over the next year. 
Those tours seemed shrouded in doubt in September, barely days after Ramiz took over as chairman, when New Zealand abandoned their tour of the country hours before the first of three One-day Internationals in Rawalpindi due to a perceived security risk. It also meant that the three-match Twenty20 series, that was to follow, was also scrapped. 
England, who were due to send their men’s and women’s team in October — with the men’s team due to play two Twenty20s, then withdrew their teams due to concerns over their players’ mental health while travelling to Pakistan.
At that point in time, it seemed Australia’s scheduled tour in March next year would also not go ahead. 
Ramiz needed to do some convincing. And he succeeded. After Australia assured it will not back out, England and New Zealand made peace with the PCB. 
England agreed to play two extra matches during its tour in September as compensation for their cancelled tour while New Zealand has also agreed to play an additional series in April 2023, after its tour of the country in December next year. 
“We have made the world realise about our presence at the International Cricket Council meetings,” Ramiz reflected, sitting alongside incoming PCB chief operating officer Faisal Hasnain. 
That wasn’t the only challenge for Ramiz.
Ahead of his imminent election Pakistan’s head coach Misbah-ul-Haq and bowling coach Waqar Younis quit their roles, leaving the team without a coach months before the Twenty20 World Cup in the UAE. 
Wasim Khan, the PCB chief operating officer at that time, also tendered his resignation. 
Despite that turmoil, the Pakistan team rose to the occasion at the T20 World Cup with a sensational run to the semi-finals where they lost to eventual champions Australia. 
They then swept Bangladesh in the T20s (3-0) and Tests (2-0) there and earlier this month romped to another T20 series sweep (3-0) against the West Indies here at the National Stadium before the ODI series was called off due to a number of Covid cases in the tourists’ camp. That series has been rescheduled for June next year.
Ramiz termed the West Indies T20s as an “eye-opener” for the PCB as despite it being the first series for Pakistan at home since their stunning World Cup performance, the National Stadium never reached full capacity. 
Part of it was also due to the West Indies arriving with their second-string squad. 
“Of course for fans, so many security checks are a hassle,” Ramiz admitted. “At the BoG mee­ting, fan engagement was a crucial part of the discussion and we’re looking at options to upgrade the viewing experience for fans.
“Our fans are of course exposed to seeing good teams and that is one reason why we’ve planned the series against Australia, England and New Zealand at a time when their best players are all available.” 
Faisal, who has previously worked at the ICC and Zimbabwe Cricket, said Pakistan needed to work to change its perception across the world.  
“It has to change,” he remarked, drawing his experience from his time at the ICC. “Of course, the players who come here don’t want to be locked up in the hotels during their tours.” 
IMPROVING PITCHES
Since taking over, Ramiz has been very vocal about improving the quality of pitches in the country and Faisal backed the PCB chairman on that. 
“International teams want better pitches, not slow pitches with no bounce,” the PCB chief remarked. 
The PCB has recently struck a collaboration deal with the Arif Habib Group to install drop-in pitches from Australia in Karachi in Lahore in a bid to simulate Australian conditions for its players. 
Pakistan have never won a Test series in Australia and the 2022 T20 World Cup is also scheduled to be held Down Under. 
“We’re striving to make cricket a strong product,” Ramiz stated. “The aim is to beat Australia in Australia.” 
Ramiz admitted that while Pakistan had formed a winning combination in T20s, it remains a work in progress in Tests and ODIs. 
“We are a mid-tier team in Tests and ODIs and the good thing about that is that gives us a chance to experiment,” Ramiz said, when asked about his views on the appointment of a full-time head coach for the team. 
Former Pakistan spinner Saq­lain Mushtaq has been interim coach since the World Cup, where he was assisted by former Aust­ralian batter Matthew Hayden and former South African all-rounder Vernon Philander as batting and bowling consultants.  
“I don’t have a set opinion on coaches,” Ramiz said, saying he had an “old school thought process” where leadership mattered most.
“Long-term coaching contracts get stuck sometimes and we’d rather hire specialists on a series-by-series basis,” he said. “Saqlain has created an environment in the team but I believe the best coaches should be at the grassroots and youth levels.” 
Ramiz informed that the BoG also discussed about creating pathways through which the best players can come up to first-class level and then get the best coaching at the National High Performance Centre. 
“We discussed on how we can have youngsters growing up to become Test cricketers and we will award contracts to the best 100 cricketers at youth levels who will train at the NHPC,” he said.
Ramiz has long spoken about improving Pakistan’s cricket economy, and creating properties including an U-19 Pakistan Super League and Women’s Pakistan Super League.
“We have to create properties of commercial value in order to reduce our dependency on ICC funding,” he stressed. 
For now, it is the HBL Pakistan Super League which remains PCB’s biggest property. The seventh edition of the league begins next month and Ramiz said the PCB was going all out to ensure that it will not be affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.
Last season, the league had to be shifted from Pakistan to the UAE due to several breaches of its bio-secure bubble while its matches were being played in Karachi. 
“We’ve learnt from the past and we will ensure that the whole of the PSL is held in the country,” he said.

12,"IPC ministry, PFF NC meet  today to resolve football crisis",Govt has put up its own demands that have to be fulfilled by normalisation committee before the PFF headquarters is handed over.,"LAHORE: An important meeting to resolve the issues of the Pakistan Football Federation is being held in Islamabad on Thursday between the Ministry of Inter-provincial Coordination and the chairman of the FIFA-appointed PFF Normalisation Committee Haroon Malik, Dawn has learnt through reliable sources.
A high-level official in the sports ministry told Dawn that IPC minister Fehmida Mirza may not attend the meeting because of other assignments, but some officials of the ministry will meet Haroon.
Pakistan was suspended by FIFA when the PFF of Ashfaq Hussain Shah, which came to power through an election held by the Supreme Court in December 2018, seized control of the PFF headquarters from the NC in March.
Since then, the PFF headquarters have been vacated and is under control of the Lahore district administration which took over after the PFF’s failure to pay its three-year lease.
FIFA will not lift the suspension until the NC gets back control of the headquarters and the official was hopeful that talks would provide a breakthrough for the restoration of Pakistan’s membership.
“The ministry has made up its mind to clear all the hurdles to hand over the FIFA House back to the Normalisation Committee,” the official said on the condition of anonymity.
The ministry had been instructed by prime minister Imran Khan in September to take steps to ensure the PFF headquarters is handed back to the NC.
However, the government has put up its own set of demands that have to be fulfilled by the NC before the headquarters is handed over.
Sources said Haroon has arrived in Pakistan and he would personally attend the meeting. Haroon had been in Canada since the takeover of the PFF headquarters by the Ashfaq Shah group.

The Barbados-born quick has been out of international action since March and his absence from England duty will now extend to over a year after it was decided the recurring stress fracture in his right elbow required another operation.
Archer, 26, had the surgery on Saturday and he has now been ruled out by the England and Wales Cricket Board of the three-Test tour of his native West Indies in March — a series officials had hoped would mark his comeback to international cricket.
But it now appears the 2019 World Cup winner will not be back in action until the 2022 English season at the earliest.
“Jofra Archer underwent a second operation on his injured right elbow on Saturday, Dec 11, in London,” said an ECB statement issued on Tuesday.
“The procedure addressed the long-standing stress fracture of his right elbow.
“A return to cricket will be determined in time, but Jofra will not be available for any of England’s remaining winter series.”
This announcement will lead to fresh debate over whether Archer, the son of an English father, can bowl again at express pace should he return to professional cricket.
He burst onto the international stage by leading England’s attack during their 2019 World Cup triumph on home soil and the Sussex quick also starred in the subsequent drawn Ashes series against Australia.
Archer had been earmarked to star in the ongoing Ashes campaign in Australia but was ruled out months before the series.
England are currently 2-0 down with three to play following a comprehensive 275-run defeat in the second Test at Adelaide.
Archer, also a leading cricketer in the T20 global franchise circuit, has repeatedly said he wants to enjoy a successful Test career but it remains to be seen if his body will allow him to return to the five-day game.
He was optimistic about his recovery when speaking to Australia’s Channel Seven earlier this month, with Archer saying:  “The [scan] results came back yesterday and it was quite promising, actually — everything is moving forward nicely.
“It’s just a matter of waiting a little bit more and being a little bit more patient because I’m almost at the end of the road.”
