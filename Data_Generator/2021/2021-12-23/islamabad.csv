0,Ghost Pims employees detected in lists sent to ministry for Covid allowance,"Inquiry report says hospital’s total strength stands at 4,200, lists contain 4,700 names; 650 genuine employees excluded.","ISLAMABAD: An inquiry committee has found a large number of ghost employees in Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) who had been nominated for Covid-19 Health Risk Allowance.
The committee also recommended disciplinary action against the Pims administration and further investigation into the disbursement of the allowance in 2019-20 and 2020-21.
The hospital has 4,200 employees but a lists of 4,700 was sent to the ministry for the allowance. Besides, 650 genuine employees of the hospital were not included in the lists.
The government had announced that the health risk allowance would be given to employees who were exposed to Covid-19 while treating patients, and therefore millions of rupees were disbursed among the employees of the federal capital’s hospitals.

Inquiry report says hospital’s total strength stands at 4,200, lists contain 4,700 names; 650 genuine employees excluded

However, employees alleged that the funds for the allowance had been misappropriated. As a result, a three-member inquiry committee, headed by Prof Nadeem Akhtar (a surgeon at Pims), was established, with Dr Aneza Jalil and Syed Wajeehul Hassan its members.
The inquiry committee was constituted “to investigate whether the employees’ lists sent to the ministry for the provision of Covid-19 allowance were genuine and identify any misappropriation in the funds,” the report said.
“Moreover, the committee was assigned the task to fix the responsibility for inclusion of names of ghost/deceased/non-entitled employees/duplication and non-inclusion of names as per policy guidelines given by the ministry. The committee held a number of meetings, reviewed available photocopies of lists and inquired the matter from a number of officers/officials of the administration and accounts department of Pims,” it said.
The report further stated that the original, duly signed lists for both financial years 2019-20 and 2020-21 were not made available to the committee, which also could not obtain the original case file with noting portion or correspondence portion despite repeated reminders to the hospital administration.
It was noticed that many support staff performing clinical duties as dressers, ward boys, etc., were omitted from the lists.
The committee stated that it could not obtain the stance of the then joint executive director/hospital director, Pims, as he could not appear before it.
“The matter of Covid Risk Allowance was not handled carefully and no committees were constituted for preparation or reconciliation of prepared lists by relevant sections. A number of procedural lacunas were identified when the whole matter was assigned to a single officer, which further worsened due to verbal directives and lack of following official rules of business of doing such communications in written format and maintaining office record of such important task.
“Neither office order was issued for such important assignment nor written guidelines/advice were issued regarding methodology to be adopted for preparation of such lists,” the report went on to say.
“The lists were prepared casually, incompletely without full name, proper identification, designation, duplication and inclusion of ghost employees, deceased employees and employees not drawing salary from Pims, employees who remained absent from duties and those residing abroad for more than a year. The basic data provided in accordance with payroll was containing wrong information and must have avoided duplication, inclusion of deceased employees and ghost employees, etc., and should have signatures/initials of higher officials from accounts section,” it stated.
The report said the office of deputy director admin-1 failed to provide record, therefore disciplinary proceedings might be carried out, adding that the committee had recommended further probe into the Covid risk allowance disbursement in 2019-20.
Talking to Dawn, Head of Grand Health Alliance Dr Asfandyar Khan said it was unfortunate that Pims had 4,200 employees but a list of 4,700 employees was sent to the ministry for disbursement of allowance to them.
Dr Khan 650 genuine employees of the hospital were missing in the list and urged the ministry to include their names as well.
“Moreover we have not received the allowance since June 30 this year, therefore we demand that the allowance be released at the earliest,” he added.

4,School employees going on strike again,Ministry fails to move summary seeking amendment to LG ordinance,"

Teachers and employess of schools started their protests after the government approved an ordinance under which FDE educational institutions would fall under the purview of the mayor. — File photo

 
ISLAMABAD: The educational activities will remain suspended in all schools of Islamabad on Thursday as teaching and nonteaching employees are all set to bring out a rally against Local Government Ordinance 2021.
The teachers, who boycotted classes for one week against the ordinance, had called off their protest after the ministry of education had assured them that it would move a summary to the federal government, seeking amendment to ordinance.
But so far it failed to move any summary.
Under the ordinance, the Federal Directorate of Education (FDE), which regulates 423 educational institutions of the capital city, will be placed under the mayor and the local government.

Ministry fails to move summary seeking amendment to LG ordinance

The teachers have been opposing this move, saying that the local government had no capacity to deal with education sector, which required billions of rupees funds annually.
The teachers said that earlier they had called off their strike on assurance by education ministry that a summary would be moved to federal government for amendment to the ordinance.
“So far, no summary has been moved to amend the ordinance, therefore, we have no other option but to take out rally against the ordinance. Our simple demand is deletion of section 166 from the LG ordinance,” said Malik Ameer Khan, President Federal Government Teacher Associations.
He said that teaching and non teaching staff will gather outside the National Press Club before moving towards D-Chowk. “This will be our one-day protest and in next phase, parents and students will also join us,” he said and added that teachers feared that if the education department is devolved to local government, schools education will become a commercial activity.
He said currently schools offer free education and students are also being provided free books, but “when the schools will be placed under mayor, the local government will impose fee.
Besides, our service structure will also be disturbed,” he said. Recently, the Special Assistant to Prime Minister (SAPM) Ali Nawaz Awan while addressing a press conference had stated that teachers and schools will remain part of the education ministry and Mayor will have regulatory check only. However, teachers said that section 166 of the Ordinance says that schools will be devolved to local government and as long as this section is not deleted, the teachers will protest, they said.
In their last protest, leaders of opposition parties, including former defence minister Khawaja Asif, former federal minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, ex-MNA Anjum Aqeel, PPP leader Sibtul Hassan Bukhari, Mian Aslam of Jamaat-i-Islami and others visited the protesting teachers and expressed solidarity with them. They also assured them of their full support.

5,Man accused of raping wife’s niece remanded in police custody in Muzaffarabad,AJK police team arrest suspect from Karachi.,"MUZAFFARABAD: A man accused of raping and subsequently impregnating his wife’s young niece some eight months ago in Jhelum Valley district of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) was remanded by a judicial magistrate in police custody for two weeks on Wednesday.
Manzar Hussain, station house officer (SHO) of City police in Hattian Bala, told Dawn that the 45 years old suspect was arrested by a team, led by him, from his rented residence in Karachi’s Korangi Town area within a week of registration of the First Information Report (FIR) on the complaint of the victim who turns 15 in February next.
Giving details, the SHO said the victim’s father used to do odd jobs to eke out a living and the Karachi-based suspect, who is her maternal aunt’s husband, would stay at their place whenever on a visit to his hometown.
In April this year, during the holy month of fasting, the suspect who had arrived from Karachi a few days ago and was staying at the victim’s place took advantage of the absence of her parents who had gone to attend some event in another village and raped her, he said.

AJK police team arrest suspect from Karachi

The suspect threatened the girl of dire consequences, if she shared the incident with anyone, he added.
However, when the victim’s condition deteriorated, her mother got her medically examined in Muzaffarabad on the advice of some of her schoolteachers only to know that she was seven to eight months pregnant, SHO Hussain said.
He said after lodging the FIR he concealed it lest its publicity might alert the suspect and travelled to Karachi with some subordinates to apprehend him.
“Accompanied by the victim’s father, when weknocked on the door of the suspect’s house he came out himself but sensing the matter the women inside the household called local police to avert arrest,”he said.
“To our surprise, the local [Zaman Town] SHO arrived on the scene within a short time and instead of handing over the culprit to us, he took him to the police station,” SHO Hussain said.
According to him, the Karachi police were maintaining that they could not hand over a wanted accused to AJK police unless the matter was taken up by AJK Home Department with the Sindh Home Department.
However, since both the temporary and permanent addresses on the CNIC of the culprit were of his Ser Bagla village near Hattian Bala, the AJK police team succeeded in bringing him to Azad Kashmir after three days but only after the concerned judicial magistrate [district judge] granted the ‘transit remand’.
The SHO said the suspect had confessed to raping the girl “only once” during his stay at his sister-in-law’s house in Ramazan.
“We will shift him to the judicial lockup at the end of his two-week physical remand,” he said.
Mr Hussain said police had got the suspect medically examined in addition to obtaining his DNA sample.
“His DNA sample and that of the baby [after delivery] will be sent to the Forensic Science Lab in Lahore and the case will be challaned after the receipt of the report,”he added.

Addressing a memorial reference for late Ziauddin Sb, organised jointly by Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ), Rawalpindi-Islamabad Union of Journalists (RIUJ), Dawn Workers Union Islamabad and the National Press Club (NPC), the speakers recalled a number of incidents associated with late Ziauddin highlighting his professionalism, high moral standards and struggle for the cause of media freedom.
The speakers shared many incidents to shed light on various aspects of the personality of the late journalist.
The speakers also recalled some instances when Ziauddin flatly refused to get any favour from those in power despite facing financial problems throughout his career spanning nearly 60 years.
Speaking on the occasion, Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) Secretary General Farhatullah Babar said he had interacted with Ziauddin Sb in various capacities and that he always found him a man of principles and commitment.
PPP MNA Syed Khushid Shah recalled that his party always used to benefit from Ziauddin Sb’s articles and presentations to understand the economic issues when they were in the opposition in 1990s.
