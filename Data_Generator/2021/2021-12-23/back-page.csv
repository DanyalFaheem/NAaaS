0,Opposition walkout mars opening day of NA’s  winter session,No agenda item could be taken up because of lack of quorum.,"ISLAMABAD: The protest walkout from the National Assembly by members of the joint opposition over the government’s reliance on presidential ordinances for legislation marred the opening day proceedings of the lower house of parliament as Speaker Asad Qaiser adjourned the sitting within minutes without taking up any agenda item after finding the house not in order due to lack of quorum. 
The speaker announced adjournment of the session till Friday after he was informed by the assembly staff that the house lacked quorum. It was pointed out by Syed Naveed Qamar of the Pakistan Peoples Party before leading the opposition’s walkout from the house. 

No agenda item could be taken up because of lack of quorum 

Mr Qamar lashed out at the government over the prevailing energy crisis in the country due to gas shortage, alleging that the government had no realisation of the difficulties being faced by the people. 
Pointing towards the assembly agenda, the PPP lawmaker said the government had become insensitive to the issue. It was evident from the fact that even a treasury member had raised the gas shortage issue through a call attention notice, he added. 
A call-attention notice submitted by Faheem Khan, a Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) MNA from Karachi, over the issue of low gas pressure and non-provision of gas to the people of Karachi was the first item on Orders of the Day. 
Besides this, a call-attention notice of the opposition PML-N members on the issue of unprecedented increase in circular debt during the tenure of the incumbent government was also part of the NA agenda. 
“As per agenda, the government is seeking extension in the life of eight ordinances on a single day. This is an insult to parliament and it shows that parliament is not functioning,” said the PPP MNA while speaking on a point of order when the speaker announced opening of the Question Hour. 
Mr Qamar said it seemed that the only task for the parliament was to give extension to the ordinances. 
“We cannot become a part of such things. We cannot become a part of such governance. We protest, stage a walkout and point out quorum,” declared Mr Qamar before leaving his seat to lead the opposition members in the walkout. 
The 33-point agenda issued by the National Assembly secretariat for Wednesday’s sitting contained resolutions seeking extension of another 120 days in the life of six already promulgated ordinances. 
Sources said the government had also planned to present a mini-budget involving fiscal adjustments and expenditure cuts worth about Rs600 billion as part of an understanding with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) during the ongoing session, but it had delayed the move for the time being. 
Opposition parties have already announced that they will not let the government get approval for the mini-budget from parliament. 
Opposition Leader in the National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif had earlier declared that passing the PTI government’s mini-budget would be like committing ‘national suicide’.  
He had stated that a collective strategy would be devised through a consensus by the joint opposition to block and reject this mini-budget because it jeopardised the country’s sovereignty.

1,France jabs children as variant surges,"""Omicron is very contagious, it will spread, and no country will be spared,” says French Health Minister Olivier Veran.","PARIS: France started vaccinating children over five and China plunged a city into a strict lockdown on Wednesday as governments scramble to contain fresh virus surges driven by the Omicron variant. 
The UK meanwhile approved Pfizer’s jab for children aged five and up, while the World Health Organisation warned that getting booster shots did not mean tossing aside safety measures at end-of-year celebrations. The threat of the highly-mutated Omicron variant is looming large over the holidays, prompting governments to roll out new restrictions and urge citizens to get vaccinated. 
The latest data suggests Omicron does not cause more severe illness than previous variants, including Delta, but scientists warn it could cause more deaths if soaring infection numbers overwhelm health systems. 
France on Wednesday opened vaccinations to children aged between five and 11, as it warned daily infections rates could hit 100,000 by year-end up from a weekly average of 54,000 daily cases. “There is one certainty. Omicron is very contagious, it will spread, and no country will be spared,” Health Minister Olivier Veran, emphasising that vaccines have an effect on the variant. 
The UK is also seeing an alarming rise in new cases and on Wednesday appro­ved Pfizer’s Covid jab for kids aged five to 11. The country clocked another daily new cases record of 106,122 as it announced it would buy millions of Covid pills.

2,"ECP accepts apologies by Fawad, Swati",Notices were issued to ministers in October for their tirade against commission,"ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan on Wednesday accepted apologies tendered by Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry and Railways Minister Azam Swati for their tirade against the ECP and its chief.  
The ECP had issued show-cause notices to the two federal ministers on Oct 27 over their caustic remarks against it and the chief election commissioner (CEC).  
Subsequently, the information minister had tendered an apology to the ECP in person on Nov 16 and Mr Swati had submitted his written apology to the commission on Dec 3.  
“I am a law-abiding person, a democratic man. I promote democracy and I have fought against corruption. I respect the Election Commission. My duty is to strengthen the ECP. I have always respected the ECP and did not try to scandalise it. If any such statement came from me, I apologise for it.” Mr Swati said in his written apology.  
At the outset of Wednesday’s hearing, the railways minister appeared before the ECP and said that he had always raised his voice to make the election commission independent.   

Notices were issued to ministers in October for their tirade against commission  

The ECP warned Mr Swati and Mr Chaudhry to be careful in future.  
Mr Swati’s lawyer Ali Zafar said: “They [the ministers] have apologised for what happened in the past.”   
In September the railways minister had levelled serious charges against the ECP of poll rigging and receiving bribes and said such institutions should be set ablaze. Continuing with the tirade, he had also raised questions over the appointment of the chief election commissioner.  
Mr Chaudhry had accused the ECP of becoming the opposition’s headquarters and the CEC of acting as their mouthpiece.  
The slanderous remarks against the ECP and the CEC came days after the commission raised objections over the bills seeking to amend the elections act to provide for introduction of electronic voting machines and internet voting system for overseas Pakistanis in the next general election.

3,EU ban on PIA flights may be lifted soon,Final report of the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s audit team will be released in a few weeks and shared publicly.,"RAWALPINDI: The ban imposed by the European Union on Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flight operations is expected to be lifted soon, as the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s (ICAO) validation committee has cleared a safety audit report after which the Significant Safety Concerns (SSC) will be gradually eased out.
“Yes, the ICAO has informed the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) that the safety audit conducted by its team recently was presented before its validation committee, which cleared it after which the SSC will be removed and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency will lift the ban,” CAA Director General Khaqan Murtaza told the participants of a meeting of the Senate Sub-Committee on Aviation on Wednesday.
He further said that until the CAA received the approval, the PIA would not be able to resume flight operations to the EU.
An ICAO audit team that had visited Pakistan to undertake a safety audit of the aviation authority completed the process on Dec 10; however, its final report will be released in a few weeks and shared publicly.
The meeting of the sub-committee on aviation was held at Parliament Lodges, Islamabad on Wednesday and convened by Senator Saleem Mandviwalla. It was attended by MNA Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, Senator Afnanullah Khan, Senator Aon Abbas, the aviation secretary, Mr Murtaza and other relevant persons.
Mr Abbasi, who was especially invited to the meeting, called for a review of and discussion on amendments to the Civil Aviation Rules of 1994 and National Aviation Policy of 2019.
He said the current aviation policy had nothing to do with aviation as the entire draft lacked points about engineering and how the CAA supported Regular Public Transport (RPT) operations, which was a basic aspect of aviation.
The former prime minister said the CAA land was most expensive in the country due to which it was difficult to install a simulator for training pilots as compared to the UAE where its cost was half of that in Pakistan. He also suggested enhancing the qualification level of new pilots to graduation and that they must possess some experience. He also suggested a separate chapter about RPT in the aviation policy, if the sector was to grow.
The participants of the meeting also discussed the shortcomings in the existing policy and proposed some suggestions regarding customs duties on aircraft parts and reducing the very high operational cost. The unavailability of qualified engineers was also discussed in the meeting.
The CAA director general said aviation policies were being devised, but hardly implemented.
Senator Mandviwalla suggested including facilities for aircrafts on ground and also discussed the issue of the Airport Security Force that, he said, claims to lack security gadgets and other equipment supposed to be provided by the CAA.
