An official announcement said that over this time per­iod, the pavilion received visits not only from the Pakistani community but many United Arab Emirates residents and foreign nationals. 
Since its opening, the Pakistan Pavilion has kept the momentum at the Expo 2020 in being an engaging, enlightening, and enjoyable experience for visitors and has been amongst the most visited pavilions at the expo.

4,SBP raises Rs158bn through PIBs,Auction received heavy participation as investors placed bids for Rs508bn while the cut-off yields remained mostly flat.,"KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) raised Rs158 billion on Wednesday against the target of Rs100bn by selling fixed-rate Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs).  
The auction received heavy participation as investors placed bids for Rs508bn while the cut-off yields remained mostly flat from the preceding auction held on Nov 29.  
Speaking to Dawn, Ismail Iqbal Securities Head of Research Fahad Rauf said the investors’ participation was significantly higher than that in the last few auctions, which showed that the market expected the yields to stay at the same level in the immediate future.  
Investors like banks and mutual funds shy away from buying bonds if they expect the yields to go up. In contrast, they purchase bonds enthusiastically when the yields are expected to decline, which enables investors to book capital gains.  
The cut-off yield for three-year PIBs, which raised Rs32.3bn, increased 16 basis points from the last auction to 11.5 per cent. The cut-off yields for five- and 10-year bonds went down two and three basis points to 11.57pc and 11.76pc, respectively.  
The SBP raised Rs107.28bn and Rs18.53bn through the five- and 10-year PIBs, respectively. The central bank didn’t receive any bids for 15- and 30-year papers. It rejected the bids for the 20-year bond.

5,Global shipping in crosshairs as environmental security deepens,Pakistan asks developed world to support the process at UN’s shipping agency.,"LONDON: Ocean freight costs are likely to remain high in 2022 as investors and regulators scramble to accelerate decarbonisation of the shipping industry and companies grapple with green financing, sources say. 
Shipping, which transports about 90 per cent of world trade and accounts for nearly 3pc of the world’s CO2 emissions, is under growing pressure from environmentalists to deliver more concrete action including a carbon levy. 
The International Maritime Organisation (IMO), the UN’s specialist shipping agency, has said it has made progress on short-term greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction measures. 
But that timeline is not seen as fast enough by environmentalists and a number of the IMO’s 175 member countries. 

Pakistan asks developed world to support the process at UN’s shipping agency

“At the MEPC (IMO committee) meeting in June next year there will be a lot of heat and pressure on regulators to ensure that they come prepared to negotiate a solution rather than kicking the can down the road because of misalignment or negotiation tactics. It is really not acceptable,” said Christian Michael Ingerslev, chief executive of Maersk Tankers. 
Last month countries including the United States at the COP 26 climate summit pushed for the IMO to adopt a zero emissions target by 2050. So far, its goal is to reduce overall GHG emissions from ships by 50pc from 2008 levels by 2050. 
A proposal submitted at the IMO to create a $5 billion research and development fund to find the right technology to meet the targets is still under discussion with further talks kicked forward to next year. 
Underscoring the challenges ahead will be the impact on poorer countries such as Pakistan. 
While the country was a small carbon emitter, climate change had “directly impacted us hard”, Pakistan’s Federal Minister of Maritime Affairs Ali Haider Zaidi said. 
“Developing countries cannot afford to spend on the type of infrastructure needed and therefore, developed countries must support the process at the IMO,” he told Reuters referring to the R&D fund. 
Financing the path ahead is another hurdle. Shipping will need $2.4 trillion to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, with around $500 billion required by 2030, according analyst estimates.

6,SECP step to facilitate overseas Pakistanis,Permission applicable only to banks that are eligible to open Roshan Digital Accounts.,"ISLAMABAD: The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) has abolished the requirement for banks to obtain separate licence for distributing mutual funds and private pension funds to Roshan Digital Accounts (RDAs). 
This relaxation has been granted to facilitate overseas Pakistanis to invest in mutual funds and private pension funds managed by Asset Management Companies and comes as part of SECP’s efforts to increase investor-base in Pakistan’s capital markets by enabling investments through RDAs. 
However, the permission is only applicable to banks that are eligible to open RDAs. For transfers to accounts other than RDAs, the licence requirement is still applicable under Securities & Future Advisor Regulations, 2017. 
The SECP has said that it is expected that this initiative will broaden the range of available investment avenues for Overseas Pakistanis and increase flow of foreign remittances to the country.
