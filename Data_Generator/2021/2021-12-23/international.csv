0,UN Security Council adopts resolution to facilitate Afghan aid,"Experts in Washington say it could help avert a humanitarian catastrophe in Afghanistan, without benefitting the Taliban.","WASHINGTON: The UN Security Council (UNSC) on Wednesday unanimously adopted a US resolution, which Pakistan believes opens the door to providing humanitarian aid to Afghanistan without violating UN sanctions on the Taliban.
The resolution allowed the “payment of funds, other financial assets or economic resources, and the provision of goods and services necessary to ensure the timely delivery of such assistance or to support such activities.” It noted that such assistance “supports basic human needs in Afghanistan” and was “not a violation” of sanctions imposed on entities linked to the Taliban.
In Washington, the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued three general licenses on Wednesday to facilitate the continued flow of vital assistance and support for the Afghan people.
“These licenses expand upon existing authorisations for the provision of humanitarian assistance and other activities that support basic human needs and enable broader support for the Afghan people consistent with the resolution adopted by the UN Security Council earlier today,” the US State Department said.
The UNSC resolution, drafted by the United States and unanimously adopted by the 15 members of the UN Security Council, “establishes a carveout in the UN 1988 sanctions regime to “ensure urgently needed aid can reach the Afghan people,” the statement added. The resolution also requests periodic updates by the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator to “ensure assistance is reaching the intended beneficiaries, not being diverted to the Taliban,” the State Department said.
“UN sanctions are an important tool to respond to threats and human rights abuses, but we must make sure these sanctions do not hinder the delivery of urgently needed aid to the Afghan people,” it added.
Later, at a news briefing in New York, Pakistan’s UN ambassador, Munir Akram, said the UN resolution made it clear that “activities supporting basic humanitarian needs in Afghanistan are not a violation of the provisions of the Security Council sanctions.”
The resolution also “permits the processing and payment of financial assistance or economic resources, and the provisions of goods and services” to prevent Afghanistan’s collapse, Mr Akram added.
Experts in Washington said that the resolution could help avert a humanitarian catastrophe in Afghanistan, without benefitting the Taliban.
Afghanistan has been pushed close to an economic meltdown after the Aug 15 Taliban takeover. The United States responded to the takeover by freezing $9.5bn of Afghanistan’s assets under its control. An earlier US resolution, which sought case-by-case authorisation of every exemption, was blocked by veto-wielding China and Russia.
“Humanitarian aid and life-saving assistance must be able to reach the Afghan people without any hindrance,” China’s UN Ambassador Zhang Jun said in a tweet. “Artificially created conditions or restrictions are not acceptable “We thank the United States for presenting a resolution. We also thank China and Russia for improving and clarifying it,” said Ambassador Akram while commenting on the process that led to the adoption of the second US resolution.
“We hope that with the adoption of this resolution, the international community, member states, UN agencies, NGOs will be able to provide all possible assistance to the Afghan people without being concerned without legal impediment,” he added.
In Kabul, a Taliban spokesperson also welcomed the UNSC resolution.
“We appreciate it (as) it can help Afghanistan’s economic situation,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said, adding he hoped the international community would also “speed up” removal of crippling economic and banking sanctions imposed on entities linked to the group.

1,Teenaged pilot takes a step closer to fly  solo around the globe,"The 19-year-old hopes to complete her 51,000-kilometre trip across five continents by mid-January 2022.","JAKARTA: Teenager Zara Rutherford, bidding to become the youngest woman to fly solo around the globe, recalled the challenges involved in crossing a deserted and icebound Siberia on Wednesday after landing in Jakarta.
The 19-year-old Belgian-British pilot, who left Belgium in August, hopes to complete her 51,000-kilometre (32,000 mile) trip across five continents and 52 countries by mid-January 2022. The toughest leg so far was flying across northern Russia, she told reporters in the Indonesian capital, because if anything went wrong, help in sub-zero temperatures would likely be hours away.
“If for any reason the engine stops I think I could survive. I could either land on the land or (use) the parachute or ditch in the water. I’ll be ok,” she said.
“The problem is if I’m in minus 35 degree Celsius, once I’m on the ground and I’m three hours away from the closest human, ...I actually don’t know how long I can survive.”

2,UN experts call for release of Kashmiri rights activist,Urge Indian authorities to repeal the laws that target Kashmiri civilians and human rights activists.,"WASHINGTON: Authorities in India must stop targeting prominent Kashmiri activist Khurram Parvez, a group of independent UN human rights experts said on Wednesday, while calling for his immediate release from detention.
Mr Parvez has documented serious human rights violations in the occupied Jammu and Kashmir, including enforced disappearances and unlawful killings and has faced reprisals reportedly for sharing information with the UN.  The Indian National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested him in November on charges related to conspiracy and terrorism.
The rights experts, appointed by the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, issued the statement after reviewing available information about the case.
A UN news report also quoted the experts as urging Indian authorities to repeal the laws that target Kashmiri civilians and human rights activists.
“We are concerned that one month after Mr Parvez’s arrest, he is still deprived of liberty in what appears to be a new incident of retaliation for his legitimate activities as a human rights defender and because he has spoken out about violations,” the rights experts said.
“In view of this context of previous reprisals, we call on the Indian authorities to immediately release him and ensure his rights to liberty and security.”
The UN agency reported that Mr Parvez was detained at the Rohini Jail Complex in Delhi, which the experts described as among “the most overcrowded and unsanitary prisons in the country, posing immediate risk to his health and safety, in particular from Covid-19.
Mr Parvez was arrested on Nov 22 under Indian counter-terrorism legislation, the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA).
Introduced in July 2019, the Act allows the authorities to designate any individual as a terrorist without the requirement of establishing membership or association with banned groups. The rights experts said the UAPA has resulted in a “worrisome rise” in the number of arrests in India, and especially in the occupied Jammu and Kashmir, the UN news agency reported.
“We regret that the government continues to use the UAPA as a means of coercion to restrict civil society, the media and human rights defenders (and their) fundamental freedoms,” the experts said.
“We therefore once again urge the government to bring this legislation in line with India’s international legal obligations under human rights law.”
Indian authorities produced Mr Parvez in a court in Delhi on Nov 30 and Dec 4 when it was decided to transfer him from NIA to judicial custody. The NIA Special Court is meeting on Thursday to decide on another extension of his detention for a further 90 days. If convicted, he could face up to 14 years in prison, or even the death penalty.

3,"IS-K is based in Afghanistan, targets both Pakistanis and Afghans, says US report","It regularly targeted civilians, armed forces personnel and even schools and places of worship in both countries.","WASHINGTON: The group known as Islamic State-Khorasan, or IS-K, “is based in Afghanistan, conducts operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and is composed primarily of former members of Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, the Afghan Taliban, and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan”, according to the latest US report on terrorism released this week.
The US State Department’s annual report estimates that IS-K still has about 1,000 fighters who operate from Afghanistan. The report describes the group’s areas of operation as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Central Asia.
Prime Minister Imran Khan said in his address at the OIC meeting in Islamabad on Sunday that IS-K was using its Afghan cell for launching attacks into Pakistan.
Former Afghan president Hamid Karzai, however, countered his argument by alleging that the group was using Pakistani soil for launching attacks into Afghanistan.
The US report, however, upheld Pakistan’s position, clearly stating that IS-K “is based in Afghanistan”, although it recruits militants from Pakistan’s tribal areas. According to the State Department’s report, IS-K receives some funding from its parent organisation, the militant Islamic State group (IS). Additional funds come from “illicit criminal commerce, taxes and extortion”, the report added. 
The IS-K’s leadership pledged allegiance to the deceased IS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi. This was accepted in 2015.
The US report pointed out that the group had carried out suicide bombings, small arms attacks, and kidnappings in Afghanistan against civilians and Afghan forces. The group has also claimed responsibility for attacks on civilians and government officials in Pakistan.
No differentiation
Details of IS-K’s activities in the US report show that the group does not differentiate between Pakistan and Afghanistan while launching terrorist attacks. 
It regularly targeted civilians, armed forces personnel and even schools and places of worship in both countries.
In 2016, IS-K attacked a Pakistani consulate in Afghanistan, killing seven Afghan security personnel; bombed a peaceful protest in Kabul, killing an estimated 80 people; claimed a shooting and suicide bombing at a hospital in Quetta, killing 94; and bombed a shrine in Balochistan, killing over 50 people.
In 2017, the militant outfit attacked the Iraqi embassy in Kabul, killing two people; bombed a mosque in western Afghanistan, killing 29 people; claimed responsibility for a double suicide bombing at a Shia neighborhood in Kabul, leaving more than 20 dead; attacked a Sufi shrine in Sindh, killing 88 people; and attacked an election rally in Balochistan that killed 149 people.
In 2019, IS-K claimed responsibility for an attack at the ministry of communications in Kabul, killing seven people. The group also claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing at a wedding hall in Kabul that year, killing 80 people.
Later that year, IS-K bombed a mosque in Nangarhar and killed 70 people.
In 2019, the IS faction suffered a series of major defeats and lost much of its territory in Nangarhar in the face of attacks by both the Defeat-IS Coalition and Taliban forces.

4,‘Good Shepherd’ gold ring found in Roman-era wreck off Israel,A red gemstone with a carving of a lyre was also found in the relatively shallow waters.,"JERUSALEM: Israeli researchers on Wednesday displayed a Roman-era golden ring with an early Christian symbol for Jesus inscribed in its gemstone, found in a shipwreck off the ancient port of Caesarea.
The thick octagonal gold ring with its green gemstone bore the figure of the  “Good Shepherd” in the form of a young shepherd boy in a tunic with a ram or sheep across his shoulders.
The ring was found among a trove of third-century Roman coins, as well as a bronze eagle figurine, bells to ward off evil spirits, pottery, and a Roman pantomimus figurine in a comic mask, the Israel Antiquities Authority said in a statement.
A red gemstone with a carving of a lyre was also found in the relatively shallow waters, as well as remains of the wooden hull of the ship, the authority said.
Caesarea was the local capital of the Roman empire in the third century, and its port was a key hub for Rome’s activity, according to Helena Sokolov, a curator at the IAA’s coin department who researched the Good Shepherd ring.
Sokolov said that while the image exists in early Christian symbolism, representing Jesus as a caring shepherd, tending to his flock and guiding those in need, finding it on a ring was rare.
The presence of such a symbol on a ring probably owned by a Roman operating in or around Caesarea made sense, given the ethnically and religiously heterogenous nature of the port in the third century, when it was one of Christianity’s earliest centres.
“This was a period when Christianity was just in its beginning, but definitely growing and developing, especially in mixed cities like Caesarea,” she said, noting the ring itself was small, implying that it may have belonged to a woman.
And while Christianity was being practised in  “underground” forums at the time, she said the Roman empire was relatively tolerant of new forms of worship including around Jesus, making it reasonable for a wealthy citizen of the empire to wear such a ring. Alongside the Roman-era finds, IAA divers also discovered in a second wreck nearby a trove of around 560 Mamluk-era coins dating from the fourteenth century.
