9,Shehbaz terms trade deficit figure alarming,"Says the economy is in ‘reverse gear’ while the industry, trade, commerce and employment were all in deplorable shape.","LAHORE: Opposition leader in National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif has said the record trade deficit of more than $5 billion this month is an alarming sign of ‘economic catastrophe’.
“The record increase in trade deficit is a clear indication of imbalance in the country’s imports and exports. The latest statistics show that the inflow of dollars in the country has decreased. The rupee is under tremendous pressure due to which its value is constantly declining. The dollar has already crossed Rs180 while the inflation is rising further which is terrible news for Pakistan,” Mr Sharif said.
The opposition leader said the economy was in ‘reverse gear’ while the industry, trade, commerce and employment were all in deplorable shape.
He said the uniform application of 17 per cent GST on more than 100 items would lead to further increase in inflation. It’s a global practice that amid high inflation GST was reduced, but in Pakistan, the world had turned upside down, he lamented.
Shehbaz Sharif said the PTI government’s step would have dire consequences as it would not help increase the tax base. He reminded Prime Minister Imran Khan Niazi of his claim to double the tax revenue.
“In a country where GST is already high, the imposition of 17pc tax on all essential commodities will further increase inflation. The government has already acknowledged 19.5pc inflation in essential commodities,” he said and added that the finance advisers were making contradictory statements on the rise and fall of inflation. “Sometimes they say Pakistan is the cheapest country and sometimes global circumstances are blamed for the worsening situation.
Meanwhile, PML-N Punjab information secretary Azma Bokhari said after a humiliating defeat in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa local body polls, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) was facing problems in finding candidates for the upcoming local polls in Punjab.
