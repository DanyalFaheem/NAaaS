0,"PHC clears PML-N's Safdar, PTM leaders of sedition charge","Safdar's counsel tells the court that the cases against his client were ""politically motivated"".","PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Wednesday quashed separate FIRs registered here against opposition Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz leader retired Captain Mohammad Safdar and several leaders of Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM) on the charges of multiple offences, including sedition.
A bench consisting of Justice Lal Jan Khattak and Justice Mussarat Hilali pronounced order after the completion of arguments by lawyers for different sides, including the provincial government, Mr Safdar, who is also the son-in-law of former prime minister and PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif, and PTM leaders, including former woman MNA Jamila Gilani, Dr Said Alam Mehsud, Sana Ijaz, Abdul Hameed Khanand lawyers Shahab Khattak, Fazal Khan, Rahim Shah and Farhad Afridi.
The high court had granted interim pre-arrest bail to Mr Safdar in the case early this year, while the PTM leaders got the same in their case in July last year. The court clubbed the cases last month.
The FIR against PTM leaders was registered at the East Cantonment police station on Jan 29, 2020, after a protest demonstration was staged against the arrest of PTM central leader Manzoor Pashteen.
The FIR was registered under Pakistan Penal Code’s sections 123-A (condemnation of creation of Pakistan), 124-A (sedition), 120-A (criminal conspiracy) and 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups) and 16Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance.

Advocates Abdul Lateef Afridi, Tariq Afghan, Shahab Khattak, Mumtaz Khan and Shah Mohammad appeared for the PTM leaders and sought the quashing of the FIR against their clients insisting its registration was based on mala fide intent and false charges.
They argued that the police in an arbitrary manner had registered the said case and levelled baseless allegations against the petitioners. They stated that the police claimed that objectionable slogans were raised against state institutions by the said activists, whereas in fact nothing of that sort had happened in the said protest demonstration.
They added that the speeches and slogans were meant to demand the supremacy of Parliament and Constitution and the release of PTM leader Manzoor Pashteen.
Similarly, the FIR against Mr Safdar was registered by SHO of East Cant police station Imran Nawaz Alam on Feb 9, 2021, after he attended a court proceeding and talked to media persons on the premises of the high court.
The SHO in the FIR claimed that he had registered the case after receiving written permission of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government.
The FIR was registered under different sections of Pakistan Penal Code including section 121 (waging war against Pakistan), 121-A (conspiracy to wage war against Pakistan), 124-A (sedition), 131 (Mutiny or seducing soldier for mutiny), 153 (provocation to cause riot) and 505 (statement to cause public mischief).
The SHO had claimed that Mr Safdar through his press conference (press talk) had not only tried to defame Pakistan and its institutions rather also tried to create anarchy in the institutions. He alleged that through his inappropriate statement Safdar had tried to instigate general public against the government and institutions and also to create rifts among the armed forces and their leadership.
He said during the media talk, the PML-N leader had used harsh language against military rulers Ayub Khan, Yahya Khan, Ziaul Haq and Pervez Musharraf.
Advocates Lateef Afridi, Manzoor Khalil and Tariq Afghan appeared for the petitioner and contended that their client was implicated in a fabricated case.
They said their client’s media statement didn’t amount to sedition or any other offence mentioned in the FIR and that he had pointed out some historical facts to the media persons and nothing was objectionable in it.
They contended that the cases against Mr Safdar were politically motivated.
In both cases, the counsel for petitioners contended that despite the court’s repeated orders, the local police had neither produced transcripts of the video clips containing speeches of the petitioners nor had they got the clips examined forensically.

1,Russian hunts Kashmir Markhor in Lower Chitral,Four permits for the hunting of markhor are sold through an open bidding process in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa every year.,"PESHAWAR: Aleksander Egrov, a Russian national, has hunted a Kashmir Markhor at Gaharait Markhor Conservancy in Lower Chitral district.
A statement issued here on Wednesday said the horn size of the eight years old goat was 36 inches.
It said that four permits for hunting of markhor were sold through open bidding process in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa every year.
The statement said 80 per cent of the bid amount went to the local communities of Chitral and Kohistan for enlisting their support in wildlife conservation and providing economic and social incentives for them.
All efforts are being made to hunt the mature male animal as it has large horns and harvesting of such older animal does not affect the reproductive capacity of the population on one hand and proves to be valuable trophy for the hunter on the other, the statement said.
Earlier this year, the wildlife department had netted the record highest amount of $575,500 (equivalent to Rs101.929 million) by auctioning four permits.
The record highest trophy hunting permit of markhor fetched $160,250 (equivalent to Rs28.362m) and second-highest permit was sold for $155,100 (equivalent to Rs27.470m).
Three hunters have hunted their trophies in Chitral and Kohistan districts out of total four permits sold for this year.

Peshawar Institute of Cardiology (PIC), the construction of which began in 2005 but was inaugurated to house Covid-19 patients, is now treating cardiac patients.
“Before the province was affected by the virus, we had oxygen plants in four teaching hospitals. Now there are 30 health facilities where the facility of oxygen exists. For Covid-19, the health department upgraded all services, especially the intensive care and high dependency units that are now being used for the treatment of non-Covid-19 patients,” Dr Ikramullah Khan, the additional director-general of health services Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, told Dawn.
He said that there were now well-equipped ICUs in Malakand, Dir Upper and Lower, Haripur, Dera Ismail Khan, Lakki Marwat, Karak and Swat where serious patients were being treated. He said that such developments at the district level occurred only because of the pandemic but those services were helping the local patients, who were previously brought to Peshawar hospitals for treatment.
Dr Ikram said that they had concentrated on provision of oxygen to health facilities due to more infections in early days. “We provided oxygen to the hospitals from the main warehouse through cylinders,” he added.
The number of ICU beds in the province reached 6,000 as opposed to only 1,000 before the arrival of the virus as there was desperate need to manage the critically-ill Covid-19 patients.
Likewise, the number of ventilators in the province had almost been tripled due to which the treatment rate of the seriously-ill patients improved, he said. “When Covid-19 broke out, we had only 70 ventilators. The number is now more than 500,” he said.
“All these facilities were upgraded due to the pandemic but now these are being utilised for general patients. In more than 50 hospitals across the province, we have enforced infection control measures to safeguard health professionals and patients from infections,” said Dr Ikram.
He said that most of the staffers were trained in infection control measures and they were taking care of the hospitals where they worked. Similarly, Covid-19 proved a blessing in disguise for the health department to develop testing facilities.
In early 2020, Public Health Reference Laboratory at Khyber Medical University started Covid-19 tests from processing 40 samples daily but within a short span of time the department put in place Covid-19 PCR facilities in 13 hospitals to ensure that the suspected patients are diagnosed promptly.
Not only public sector, but in private sectors five Covid-19 laboratories were allowed after inspection by the department to make sure that the people get tested everywhere in the province.
Dr Ikram said that the Peshawar Institute of Cardiology was completed but not functional because of lack of facilities there. “With the occurrence of the pandemic, we equipped the building to be utilised for coronavirus patients as number of patients continued to surge,” he said. However, the number of patients declined and no patient was admitted there, he added.
He said that PIC was ultimately inaugurated by prime minister in December last year, where heart patients were being treated free of cost. The 295-bed PIC is offering cardiac surgery, for both paediatric and adult patients.
Same is the case of Institute of Hepatology, the building of which was completed but it was not made functional. It was made functional to deal with Covid-19 patients. The institute will soon start providing basic services to hepatitis patients.

Party leader says reorganisation to focus on next general elections

They also expressed dissatisfaction over the role of provincial leadership for not taking action against the people who created problems for the relevant office-bearers.

He said the people who violated the party discipline had been issued show cause notices, mainly in Nowshera.
He said the party would focus on reorganisation in the provincial assembly constituencies to prepare itself for the next general elections.
He said the participants raised several issues, including issuance of party tickets, and gave useful suggestions.
“Though we could not win the election, we have improved our vote bank,” Mr Abbas said.
According to a separate statement, a five-member committee has been formed for reorganisation of the party in Peshawar city district. The committee includes former provincial president Syed Zahir Ali Shah, provincial senior vice-president Syed Ayub Shah, provincial deputy information secretary Tahir Abbas, comrade Anwar Zeb and Khwaja Yawar Naseer.
