• Expects K-IV water project to complete by Sept 2023
• Says Karachi needs autonomy with direct election of mayor
KARACHI: Striking a tone of reconciliation for a second consecutive time during his as many visits to Karachi, Prime Minister Imran Khan on Friday called for better coordination between Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf-led Centre and the Sindh administration of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) for Karachi’s uplift. He made a “request” to the provincial government to participate in the health insurance scheme and approve Bundal Island’s development.
In his 13-minute address at the opening ceremony of the Green Line bus service, PM Khan was focused and sounded convinced about a few issues ranging from Karachi’s development to building new cities and from the role of the upcoming local governments in urban centres to the working relationship between the federal government and the provinces. The speech also covered sketchy details of the Karachi Transformation Plan of the federal government.
The PM, before summing up his speech, directly addressed the Sindh government with an advice that their participation in the health card scheme and nod to the development of the Bundal Island would ultimately benefit the people of the province and its economy. 
“I want to ask the Sindh government to participate in the health card scheme,” he said while mentioning that it would cover every family across Punjab by March. He said it had also been extended to every corner of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, whereas the Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir governments were ready to join it. 
“People in Sindh are also our people. They are also Pakistanis. They also deserve this facility that provides health insurance up to Rs1 million to each family. They can go to any hospital and avail treatment,” he remarked.
Island city 
In the same breath, he asked the Sindh government to reconsider its tough stance on Bundal Island’s proposal where the federal government had planned to build a new city infrastructure and invited real estate tycoons and builders, but the PPP administration had called Islamabad’s move an attempt to “occupy” the provincial resources putting the whole idea on the backburner.
For the development of the twin islands off Karachi coast, which the federal government had initially suggested in September 2020, the prime minister elaborated on approaching challenges that demanded immediate but sustainable solutions. 
The PM had made a similar appeal to the Sindh government while addressing a groundbreaking ceremony of the Karachi Circular Railway (KCR) project at Karachi Cantt Railway Station in September.
“The Sindh government must consider its approval for the development of Bundal Island,” he said. “Our cities are growing fast and waywardly in an absolutely unorganized way. We need to develop new cities. The way our cities are expanding, we would not be able to manage them. We would not be able to provide them transport, control their sewage system or manage their water supply. We need to develop new cities like Dubai and New York. The development of these islands would benefit Sindh, its people and its economy. With the same ideology, we are building new Ravi City in Lahore. So I request you [Sindh government] to allow this [development programme].”
Mr Khan was all praise for his party leaders, especially Sindh Governor Imran Ismail and federal Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Asad Umar, for their efforts towards completion of the Green Line bus project that suffered many hiccups over the past many years doubling its cost.
Envisaged and executed in February 2016 by then prime minister Nawaz Sharif, the Green Line project was originally scheduled to complete within a year at an estimated cost of around Rs16.85 billion, but its cost surged to Rs35bn mainly due to the delay in its completion.
It was approved by the Executive Committee of National Economic Council and executed by the Sindh Infrastructure Development Company Limited. In all, 80 buses for the project have arrived in the city in two consignments, removing the last hurdle in the first-ever Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) for Karachi.
There are 21 stations along the bus route from KESC Powerhouse Chowrangi in Surjani Town to Merewether Tower covering Nagan Chowrangi, North Nazimabad, Nazimabad and Gurumandir.
The PM said his government was very much confident about the completion of the K-IV project by August-September 2023 for supply of 260 million gallon water to Karachi. Mr Khan said the project had been handed over to Wapda, which was set to award its contract. 
The project, officially known as Greater Karachi Water Supply Scheme, was originally launched in 2011.
PM Khan also called for stronger and resourceful municipal systems mainly in urban centres of the country. Without directly commenting on the recently passed Sindh Local Government [Amendment] Bill 2021 by the PPP government, the premier blamed weaker and ineffective local government systems in the past as key reasons that “pushed Karachi backwards”.
“I have been seeing Karachi more closely for the last five years,” he said. 
He said it was so unfortunate that instead of going forward, the city was moving backward. “Karachi needs autonomy. It needs a stronger system. There should be a direct election of mayor in the city like we are bringing systems in Punjab and KPK. Look at Tehran. Despite being world sanctions, it gives you a look of the modern city. It is because of a strong and modern management system. I was told that Tehran generates US $500million a year on its own through which it manages the whole city. Then you compare it with Karachi. This city hardly collects $30m. We need to fix the management. We need a strong and modern local government system,” he asserted.

1,"Shehbaz, sons failed to give trail of Rs16bn in sugar scam: FIA","""The father and son did not cooperate with the FIA during a probe spanning over a year,"" says official.","LAHORE: The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has completed the investigation into allegations against Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz President Shehbaz Sharif and his son, Hamza Shehbaz, in the sugar scam, declaring that both have failed to present the money trail of Rs16 billion.
“Shehbaz Sharif and Hamza Shehbaz couldn’t submit a money trail of the Rs16bn they are accused of laundering in the sugar scam. The FIA has finalised the investigation against the duo and others in the scam and is likely to submit a challan in this regard to the trial court on Saturday (today),” an official disclosed while talking to Dawn on Friday.
The duo had earlier secu­red pre-arrest bail in the case till Saturday (today). 
Most of the 17 suspects who the FIA investigated were those in whose names bank accounts had been opened to launder the money, the official alleged.
Mr Shehbaz’s son, Suleman, who was also nominated in the case, has been in the UK for the last few years.
“The father and son did not cooperate with the FIA during a probe spanning over a year. They did not provide answers to the queries regarding opening of accounts in the name of their (Sharifs) clerical staff and using them to launder Rs16bn,” the official said.
During the investigation, the FIA also quizzed some other employees related to Al-Arabia Sugar Mills Ltd, Ramzan Sugar Mills Ltd and the Shehbaz family-owned business entities. “Evidence against the duo was also collected from relevant departments,” he explained. 
The FIA booked Mr Shehbaz and his two sons, including leader of the opposition in the Punjab Assembly Hamza, mainly under sections 5(2) and 5(3) (criminal misconduct) of the Prevention of Corruption Act read with 3/4 of the Anti-Money Laundering Act.
According to the agency, while conducting a criminal investigation with respect to Al-Arabia Sugar Mills Ltd/Ramzan Sugar Mills Ltd and the Shehbaz family businesses, they discovered over Rs16bn deposited in the bank accounts opened/operated in the names of peons and clerks of the sugar mills between 2008 and 2018 when Mr Shehbaz held the Punjab chief minister’s office.
The FIA claimed to have collected ‘credible evidence’ of over Rs16bn (including gratifications from sources extraneous to sugar business) in the accounts opened and operated in the name of low-wage employees of the family’s sugar mills.
“The money received from the accounts of low-wage employees by Shehbaz was transferred outside Pakistan via hundi/hawala networks, ultimately destined for beneficial use of his family members,” the agency added.
Earlier, the FIA had accused the prime suspects of money laundering worth Rs25bn, but in the final report it mentioned to have collected evidence of Rs16bn.
Both Mr Shehbaz and Mr Hamza during their appearance before the FIA had tried to defend the charges against them but the latter insisted upon providing a money trail.

2,IHC finds replies in ex-CJP Saqib Nisar audio leak case evasive,Former GB chief justice ordered to file original affidavit or else face indictment on 13th.,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) in a written order issued on Friday on proceedings related to former chief judge of Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) Rana Mohammad Shamim’s affidavit termed the replies submitted by the alleged contemnors ‘evasive’ and declared that charges would be framed against them on Monday in case they failed to submit the original copy of the affidavit.
The ex-chief judge in his statement had earlier taken the stance that his affidavit might have been ‘leaked’ by the UK’s Notary Public and published by the media. However, the IHC noted that the alleged contemnors had to discharge a heavy onus to satisfy the court about veracity of the published affidavit’s contents that appeared to be ‘false’.
In a written order, IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah warned that charges would be framed if the maker of the affidavit, Mr Shamim, the publisher and editor in chief of Jang Group Mir Shakeelur Rehman, senior journalist Ansar Abbasi and resident editor Amer Ghouri failed to show it was executed and published for bona fide purpose.

Former GB chief justice ordered to file original affidavit or else face indictment on 13th

Justice Minallah issued the order after going through the reply submitted by Mr Shamim in which he explained reasons for executing the statement on oath that former Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Saqib Nisar had made a call to an IHC judge and asked him not to release former premier Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz before the 2018 general election.
“Perusal of the written reply submitted by Rana Mohammad Shamim shows that he has unequivocally taken the stance that he had neither circulated the affidavit to the press nor ‘shared it with anyone’. He has further stated that ‘I made the statement before the Notary Public at London and while placing the same in a sealed envelope, handed it over to my grandson with a clear instruction that neither he would open it nor share the same with anyone’. It has been stated that the copy of the statement was retained by the Notary Public in London for record,” Justice Minallah noted.
“It, prima-facie, appears that Rana Mohammad Shamim has suggested that the affidavit may have been leaked, without his consent, by the Notary Public who had notarized his affidavit in London. He has also unambiguously alleged that his affidavit was used for publication by the alleged contemnors, Ansar Abbasi, Aamir Ghouri and Mir Shakeel ur Rehman without his express or tacit consent/approval. If so, then this could have serious consequences for the Notary Public in London as well as the alleged contemnors who appear to have published the contents of the affidavit in haste with the intent to disseminating it widely amongst public at large,” the court order stated.
‘Judge named in affidavit was on leave’
Regarding Mr Shamim’s assertions that he had overheard a phone conservation of ex-CJP Nisar with the IHC judge on July 15, 2018, Justice Minallah observed: “The judge named in the copy of the affidavit attached with the reply was availing sanctioned ex-Pakistan leave and was out of the country on July 15, 2018.”
According to the IHC order, the timing of news report publication was “crucial” as it related to the appeals fixed for hearing. “It also raises questions regarding the professional conduct of the reporter, editor and publisher of the widely circulated newspaper,” the order stated.
Subsequently, the court held “it has become crucial for the alleged contemnor, Rana Mohammad Shamim, to produce the original affidavit before the court. Likewise, the veracity of the contents of the affidavit published in the newspaper is questionable and the facts narrated therein do not appear to be probable even to an ordinary person of prudent mind. There are, prima-facie, reasonable grounds to believe that the contents of the affidavit are false and its execution was not for a bona fide purpose.”
The court stated that the alleged contemnors “have to discharge a heavy onus to satisfy the court regarding bonafides of executing the affidavit in London and its publication without verification of the essential facts. The contents cast unfounded aspersions on the integrity, independence and impartiality of this court and its judges besides prejudicing the right of fair trial of the parties in the pending appeals and tends to interfere with the administration of justice.”
Justice Minallah termed the replies submitted by the alleged contemnors “evasive” and, prima-facie, unsatisfactory. The IHC warned Mr Shamim to submit original copy of the affidavit or else charges would be framed on December 13.

3,Foreign Office slams diplomatic boycott of Beijing Olympics,Pakistan’s criticism of boycott closely follows its decision about not attending ‘Summit for Democracy’ being hosted by US.,"ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office has criticised the planned diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing by the United States and some other countries and called for keeping politics out of sports.  
“Pakistan opposes any form of politicisation of sports and hopes that all nations would come together in Beijing and afford their athletes the opportunity to compete against the best and showcase their skills,” FO spokesman Asim Iftikhar said at a weekly media briefing here on Friday.  
He was commenting on reports that the US, Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia would not send their officials to Beijing in protest against the host country’s human rights violations as well as crackdown in Hong Kong. These countries would, however, not stop their athletes from participating in the games.  
The Winter Olympics are being held in Beijing and towns in the neighbouring Hebei province from February 4 to 20 next year.  
China had reacted strongly to the boycott announcements. Chinese foreign ministry’s spokesman Zhao Lijian warned of “resolute counter-measures”, but did not specify what actions could be taken. He had also accused the US of violating the principle of “political neutrality in sport”.  
Mr Iftikhar wished China success in hosting Beijing Olympics. “We are confident that despite limitations imposed by Covid-19, the Beijing Winter Olympics would offer a spectacular and colourful gala to sports enthusiasts around the world, including in Pakistan,” he said  
Pakistan’s criticism of the boycott moves closely follows its decision about not attending the ‘Summit for Democracy’ being hosted by the US.  
Many believed Pakistan decided to skip the event because China had not been invited, while Taiwan was on the guest list. This impression was further strengthened when Zhao Lijian, in a Twitter posting, hailed Pakistani decision to stay out by saying: “A real iron brother.”  

 



 
Although Prime Minister Imran Khan, while speaking at the Institute of Strategic Studies on Thursday, said Pakistan would not become part of any bloc in the feared new cold war, Islamabad’s moves show it’s getting increasingly aligned with Beijing.  
There have also been speculations of Pakistan breaking up with the West. 
The FO spokesman rejected such an impression. “Some of the opinions and impressions that I gather from your questions, I think, are unfounded,” he maintained.  
He said Pakistan was closely engaged with the US on a range of issues. “We value our partnership with the US and we wish to expand it bilaterally as well as in terms of regional and international cooperation,” he noted.

4,EU panel chides World Bank over Pakistan energy woes,"‘Prior actions’ of the lender back a long-term power production plan that contradicts itself, says report.","ISLAMABAD: A European think tank has blamed the World Bank for a role in Pakistan’s energy sector problems over the decades and for rushing through a long-term power generation plan based on dirty and expensive fuels under its ‘prior actions’ of loan programmes.
Recourse — an Amsterdam-based non-profit organisation — claims it holds financial institutions to account for harms to people and the environment and is funded by foundations and organisations working for environment and development under the European Union.
In its report “World Bank’s Development Policy Finance (DPF) 2015-21: Stuck in a carbon rut”, the European think tank said its studies in Indonesia and Pakistan showed the WB was “accelerating the use of natural gas and supporting fragile energy sectors that are heavily invested in coal”.

‘Prior actions’ of the lender back a long-term power production plan that contradicts itself, says report  

“In Pakistan the case study observes how DPF can have unintended consequences, even when ostensibly it is seeking to support a renewable energy transition,” the report said, adding the $400 million Programme for Affordable and Clean Energy (PACE) 2021/22 focused on measures to support the country’s transition to low-carbon energy. This loan disbursement was dependent on a prior action that required a commitment from the Pakistan government to transition to 66pc renewable energy by 2030 through the adoption of Indicative Generation Capacity Expansion Plan (IGCEP), a least-cost generation plan. However, targets on renewable energy sources were slashed from 30-33pc of the energy mix to 17pc.
The energy plan includes the “commissioning of a portfolio of new generation projects including many hydropower projects, Thar coal-based projects, K-3 nuclear power plant, and over 4,000MW of solar- and wind-based renewable energy projects,” the report said, adding that the DPF was not subject to proper checks and balances in terms of transparency and accountability.
The report said the World Bank’s Prior Actions were opening a Pandora’s Box for unsustainable energy in Pakistan. The report said that despite the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015, the World Bank committed $1.1 billion between 2014 and 2016 to energy sector reform in Pakistan that had an emphasis on tariff reform as “Prior Actions” to the disbursement of funds. “This tariff reform paved the way for Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) to offer the most attractive upfront tariff for coal-fired power projects in the world”, thereby setting the stage for massive expansion of coal in the Thar region and beyond.
In 2021, Pakistan is completing its second year of foundational reforms to comply with ‘Prior Actions’ for three DPF operations amounting to $1.4bn. “In our analysis, the Prior Actions required by this DPF operation have had a destabilising effect on Pakistan’s ability to transition to a sustainable renewable energy pathway,” the report claimed.
On August 26, 2021, it said, Pakistan’s cabinet committee on energy under immense pressure to meet its Prior Actions towards the World Bank gave its hasty approval to the controversial IGCEP, which was approved a month later by Nepra with a strong dissenting note from Nepra’s vice-chairman who refused to sign it. The political pressure to fast-track the IGCEP came in August when WB Vice President Hartwig Schafer visited Pakistan and urged the government to accelerate the pace of power sector reforms.
The generation mix in the new IGCEP is now dominated by expensive and dirty fossil fuels, with additions of around 8.5GW of coal, and 10GW of LNG and gas to be made in the next 10 years. The IGCEP itself confirms that renewable energy is quickly becoming cheapest forms of new electricity generation, yet the IGCEP contradicts itself with the recommendation to rely less on these sources.
“The IGCEP cannot, therefore, be considered a least-cost plan as it set out to do and it violates the very aims and purposes set by the Pakistan government and the World Bank. Yet the government is still pushing it through post-haste, because of the Prior Actions imposed by the bank itself,” the report said.
