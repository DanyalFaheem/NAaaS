Presiding over the ceremony, Sindh Energy Minister Imtiaz Ahmed Sheikh said the power generated by the solar parks was affordable and environment friendly for the city. 
Despite federal government’s obstructive and delaying policies, he said, construction of the 350-megawatt solar parks was tantamount to crossing a milestone. 
The energy minister said a 175MW solar park on 600 acres would be set up in Deh Halkani, Manghopir in district West, while another 175MW solar park on 600 acres would be established in Deh Shah Mureed in district Malir. 
Cost of these two solar gardens is estimated at Rs40 million each; they would have a total generating capacity of 350MW. It will be completed in two years to provide affordable, transparent and eco-friendly electricity in the city. 
Imtiaz Ahmed Sheikh said the provincial government’s Sindh Transmission and Dispatch Company would lay a transmission line for the two solar parks while K Electric would build a grid station and purchase electricity from those solar parks. 
He said low-cost electricity would also reduce the tariff and facilitate affordability to citizens. 
He said the Sindh government was working expeditiously on transparent sources of energy in accordance with global environmental protocols and solar park projects would also be launched for other cities. 
Earlier, the MoU was signed by Energy Secretary Abu Bakar Madani, K-Electric chief executive officer Monis Alvi and World Bank Pakistan Chief Mr Najy Benhassine.

2,Rallies held on HR day across Sindh against ‘forced’ conversion,KARACHI: Civil society organisations and members of minority communities on Friday held demonstrations in different...,"KARACHI: Civil society organisations and members of minority communities on Friday held demonstrations in different cities and towns of Sindh to mark the Universal Declaration of Human Rights Day.
In Hyderabad, members of the Christian community held a demonstration outside the local press club against rejection of the ‘Forced Conversion Bill’ and other issues under the aegis of the Rapha Prayer Ministry International.
The protest was led by Senator Anwar Lal Deen, Advocate M. Parkash, Pastor Victor, Pastor Suleman Manzoor, Pastor Ghazala Shafi Romas Bhatti and others.
They told the participants that forced conversion was a crime and could not be accepted be it for the purpose of marriage. They observed that underage marriages after forced conversion was a serious problem. “The Christian community in Pakistan has performed outstandingly in terms of services in education, medical and defence sectors. In lieu of it, Christians should not, at least, be discriminated against,” they said.
The speakers noted that the federal ministry for religious affairs did not approve the forced conversion bill on two grounds — inappropriate time for the passage of the bill; and it would be more harm than beneficial. “Both the reasons are political and negate minorities’ fundamental rights,” they said.
“We are not a conquered community but natives of this homeland. We also want our rights on a parity basis,” they said. They dispelled the impression that the bill was in conflict with teachings of Islam. They recalled that a five-judge bench of Supreme Court had given a judgement in the Khursheed Bibi case declaring marriage a social contract. In the presence of this judgement, why minorities were being deprived of their rights?” they argued. They also pointed out that in 1927, Muslims had presented a similar bill during the British rule demanding that Muslim girls’ forced conversion be stopped. “Now minorities in Pakistan face the same threat and, as such, they should be supported,” they said.
In Jacobabad, activists of various human rights organisations and members of minority communities took out a rally raising slogans against forced conversion. They started their march from Shaheed Allah Bux Park and after passing through various roads converged on the local press club.
Speaking to the participants and local reporters, Jawahir Singh, Burner B. Newton alias Tony, Shalo Ram, Lachman Das and others claimed that cases of forced conversion of Hindu girls in Jacobabad district and its surrounding areas had been on the rise for quite some time. They expressed their concerned over reports that underage girls and young women of the Hindu community were lured into a love affair and then forced to convert. They termed it an unethical and unlawful trend that caused indignation in the Hindu as well as other minority communities in the country.
“Our religious beliefs must be respected for the sake of brotherhood and harmony between Muslims and all minorities including Hindu, Christian and Sikh communities,” they said.
They urged the federal and all provincial governments to enact and effectively implement a law against forced conversion. 
Rallies and demonstrations for a better situation vis-a-vis human rights, religious freedom and tolerance, freedom of expression, dispensation of quick justice in human rights cases etc were held in many other cities and towns of Sukkur, Larkana, Mirpurkhas, Badin, Shikarpur, Kandhkot-Kashmore and Thatta districts.

3,Aijaz Shirazi remembered on first death anniversary,THATTA: Hundreds of people from all walks of life travelled to the Shirazi House here from different areas of ...,"THATTA: Hundreds of people from all walks of life travelled to the Shirazi House here from different areas of Thatta, Sujawal and some neighbouring districts to attend the first death anniversary of Syed Aijaz Ali Shah Shirazi on Friday. 
They included supporters and followers of the deceased politician, leaders and workers of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and other political entities, nationalist groups, civil society organisations, lawmakers and members of the Shirazi community, besides relatives of the deceased. 
Paying homage to the late leader, PPP Sindh president Nisar Khuhro described Aijaz Shirazi as the most popular political figure of the coastal region. Praising his political acumen, Mr Khuhro said the late Shirazi always played a right card while dealing with a ruling party at the Centre and in Sindh. He stood firm on the issue of Kalabagh dam during the joint struggle launched by PPP leader Benazir Bhutto and Awami Tehreek chief Rasool Bux Palijo, Mr Khuhro recalled.
He said Aijaz Shirazi also played a practical and prominent role in all campaigns for the rights and welfare of the poor and helpless people of Thatta and Sujawal. In this regard, he specially mentioned the role of Shirazi family in the event of natural calamities, unlawful activities aimed at land-grabbing, attempts by outsiders to usurp rights of local people and fishermen community and excesses against the poor and downtrodden segments of the area.
Mr Khuhro noted that the late Shirazi was highly inspired by PPP founder chairman Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, and pointed out that the entire Shirazi family having several lawmakers always supported PPP. 
The Shirazi Group [comprising the family’s political personalities] wielded considerable influence in politics of the area thanks to the political acumen of the late leader, he said, and said that over the last 40 years, members of this family remained elected members of the National Assembly, Sindh Assembly or local government institutions. 
Other speakers acknowledged that the Shirazi Group maintained a strong and ever-growing vote bank in the twin districts due to its people-friendly attitude and services, deliverance, sincerity and public welfare activities. Syed Aijaz Ali Shirazi was the brain and motivational force behind its growth and success, they said.  
Former senator Syed Shafqat Hussain Shah Sheerazi, who now heads the Shirazi Group, MNA Syed Ayaz Ali Shah Shirazi and MPA Syed Riaz Shah Shirazi told the audience that the death of their mentor was an irreparable loss not only to the group and PPP, but also to all people of Thatta, Sujawal and Sindh’s coastal areas. His unparalleled services to the masses could never be forgotten, they said.
Provincial Minister for Local Government Syed Nasir Hussain Shah, former chairman of Thatta district council Ghulam Qadir Palijo, Ghulam Qadir Malkani, Mohammad Ali Malkani, Sadiq Ali Memon, Mehmood Alam Shah and others also attended the anniversary programme.

6,PPP spreads anti-PTI protests across Sindh,"“The PTI government has broken a 70-year-old record of inflation in over the past three years,” says Saeed Ghani.","KARACHI: In line with its countrywide call for protest against growing inflation and economic policies of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government, the Pakistan Peoples Party on Friday staged protests across Sindh where leaders and workers vowed to continue their struggle till the ouster of Prime Minister Imran Khan. 
In Karachi, a large number of party activists gathered near Empress Market in the second half of the day where the party’s Karachi president and Sindh Information Minister Saeed Ghani, Sindh PPP general secretary Waqar Mehdi led the protest. 
The PPP leaders accused the PTI government of toeing the line of International Monetary Fund, which had led to a human crisis in the country amid growing inflation and declining business activities. 
“The PTI government has broken a 70-year-old record of inflation in over the past three years,” said Mr Ghani while addressing the demonstration. 
“Everyone is out on roads protesting against this incompetent government and asking for the prime minister to resign. Inflation has reached nine per cent in Pakistan according to the World Bank which is higher than other South Asian countries and instead of fixing this crisis, the government has also warned of higher inflation. This is exactly why PPP is marching today against crippling inflation, and unaffordable life in Naya Pakistan.” 
He said that PPP would always be standing with the people of Pakistan as the party was on the same page with them, unlike this government. 
Considering the prevailing situation the resignation of the prime minister was a justified demand of the people, the PPP leaders said. 
Protest in other cities 
In Sukkur, senior PPP leader Syed Khursheed Ahmed Shah led a protest demonstration against the federal government’s policies and price hike. 
Addressing the protesters at Sukkur Bypass, he said that Imran Khan, prior to becoming prime minister used to boast about bringing a political and social change. But he failed, he said. 
In Hyderabad, PPP activists blocked a section of Hyderabad Bypass near Qasimabad and chanted slogans against the PTI government. 
Led by PPP’s Sindh chapter president Nisar Khuhro and other leaders, the protesters staged a sit-in on main road. 
Addressing the protesters, Mr Khuhro said that the people were holding protests right from Karachi to Kashmore against price hike and added that the people were forced either to sell themselves or commit suicide. 
He said that Imran Khan was living in Banigala by declaring it the Prime Minister House. He said that Rs4 were being increased in fuel prices every month and this would not help control price hike and added that petrol would be available at Rs200 per litre if this government remained in power. 
He stated that while electricity was not available, its tariff was continuously being increased. 
In Larkana, Aijaz Leghari, general secretary of the PPP’s Larkana district, along with other office holders staged a sit-in at Sachi Bakhsh Jagirani bypass and Shaikh Zayed Road. 
Carrying banners and placards and chanting slogans, they lashed out the performance of the PTI government that had “gifted people with unbearable price hike” making difficult for the people to hardly have two times meal. 
In Mithi, the PPP workers also took to the streets to register their protest against the rising prices and inflation. 
A large number of party workers under the leadership of Dr Mahesh Kumar Malani after marching on different roads of the town gathered at Kashmir Chowk where they staged a demonstration to record their protest.

7,Grisly murder of 65-year-old man terrorises Karachi,"Police find victim’s severed head, hands in a box...","KARACHI: A sexagenarian man was found brutally murdered in his Saddar apartment on Friday, police said.
They said that he was allegedly murdered by a 40-year-old woman, who had been living with the victim for the past several years.
Preedy SHO Sajjad Khan said that the building watchman saw a severed hand outside the apartment of Shaikh Muhammad Sohail at Ilaco House in State Life Building No 5, off Abdullah Haroon Road, and he informed other residents and police about it. 
The SHO said police reached the apartment, located on the mezzanine floor of the building, where they saw the decapitated body of Shaikh Muhammad Sohail, 65, lying on the floor. They found the severed head and hands in a box in the same room.

Police find victim’s severed head, hands in a box

As the news of the murder spread in the neighbourhood, fear gripped residents when they came to know about the horrifying details.
A woman, identified as Rubab, 40, was sleeping in the next room and she appeared to be intoxicated when police woke her up.
Neighbours told the police that she was living with the man and claimed that she was his wife. “As per witnesses, the couple usually quarrelled with each other over some domestic issues,” said the SHO. 
The woman was taken into custody and the police called the victim’s son, Shaikh Shahid, and other relatives. The body was shifted to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre to fulfil medico-legal formalities. 
The policemen called the Crime Scene Unit, which secured the evidence. 
Additional Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said the head was smashed with a hammer or some hard and blunt object as there were three fractures. He was decapitated and hands were also severed. 
She said the suspect was also brought to the hospital for a medical examination. She was ‘very aggressive’ and told the doctors that she had taken ‘ice’, or crystal meth, in the night. 
Dr Syed said the relatives accompanying the body claimed that the victim was a doctor and Rubab was a nurse at his clinic. 
However, the SHO said his relatives told him that the victim, father of eight, that the woman had been living with their father for the past six/seven years, but they did not know their exact relation. 
The SHO said a girl child was also living with the couple. The suspect claimed that she was the daughter of the deceased. But the victim’s son told the police that when they had asked for a DNA, the suspect did not allow it. 
Sources said that the woman in her initial statement said that both of them were addicted to ‘ice’. She initially confessed to have killed him saying the man used to torture her, but later on changed her statement, they added. 
Meanwhile, a murder case under Section 302 (premeditated murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code was registered against the held woman, Rubab alias Sonia alias Asma, on the complaint of the victim’s son, Sheikh Mohammed Shahid, who is a private contractor by profession. 
The complainant told the police that he was informed about the murder by people living in his father’s building. He said when he reached the apartment he saw the body of his father lying in a store-like room with severed head and hands. 
He said that he believed that his father was killed by Rubab, who had been living with his father for years.

8,Door-to-door vaccination drive begins after Omicron threat,"Department collected double samples of each individual to minimise chances of false-negative cases, says official.","KARACHI: The health department on Friday initiated a door-to-door Covid-19 vaccination drive in Jamshed Town that recently reported a suspected case of Omicron variant, officials told Dawn.
The area, they said, wasn’t under any form of lockdown yet.
“A decision in this regard would be taken once (polymerase chain reaction test) results of the 51 samples obtained from people residing in the neighbourhood of the suspected female patient are received,” said health department’s spokesperson Atif Vighio.
The department in the meantime, he said, was focusing on community counselling on Covid-19 vaccination and compliance to the standard operating procedure (SOPs) as officials found a large number of unvaccinated individuals in the locality.
“We are telling them why it’s important to get vaccinated and ensuring complete adherence to SOPs. There is no involvement of any law enforcement agency right now,” he said.
About the 51 samples being tested for Covid-19, he said the department had collected double samples of each individual to minimise chances of false negative cases.
On Thursday, the health department had confirmed the first suspected case of Omicron variant in the country. The female suspected patient, a resident of Jamshed Town, had been discharged from Aga Khan University Hospital and currently under home isolation along with another family member in her 80s.
Samples collected from the suspected patient and her two male relatives, who are under treatment at the AKUH, have been collected for genome sequencing to confirm infection of Omicron variant. The results will take one to two weeks, officials said.
Health minister Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho in a statement said that the Omicron variant was very transmissible but deaths or serious illness had not been seen in recent reports coming from South Africa, where the variant was first detected.

9,Commissioner earns SHC’s ire over fixing of milk price,Court summons senior official on Jan 4...,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court has expressed displeasure over the Karachi commissioner for apparently not implementing the earlier court orders about fixation of official price of fresh milk.
A two-judge bench headed by Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha directed Commissioner Mohammad Iqbal Memon to appear in court on Jan 4 and explain whether he had followed a March 2007 SHC order regarding mechanism of fixing milk price.
It further asked the commissioner as to why he did not call one of the petitioners, the All Karachi Milk Retailers Welfare Association, to attend the meeting regarding fixation of milk price despite the order of the bench issued on a previous hearing.

Court summons senior official on Jan 4

When the bench took up for hearing a set of petitions about price and quality of milk, an assistant advocate general submitted that in the light of an earlier order, the commissioner had fixed the official price of milk at Rs120 per litre.
However, a lawyer for one of the petitioners submitted that the foundation order of the SHC about fixation of milk price was handed down in 2007 and it had set out the mechanism to ascertain the milk price.
The counsel further argued that the commissioner did not comply with the order in question in letter and spirit despite the passage of around 14 years.
The bench recalled that in its earlier order the commissioner was directed to sit together with relevant officers/officials of the Sindh Food Authority (SFA) and office-bearers/representatives of milk association to get their point of view and sort out a formula to achieve the objective to ensure that the milk was sold at fixed price and maintain its quality.
The lawyer submitted that one of the petitioners representing an association was not called to attend the meeting and not given an opportunity to express his view on fixation of milk price. 
He claimed that the price of mike fixed by the commissioner was much lower as compared to market price.
Last month, the commissioner office had submitted that negotiations with all stakeholders were in the final phase and sought more time to fix the price of milk.
In September, the division bench had directed the commissioner to consult with SFA and representatives of milk associations for fixation of milk price.
In October, the commissioner in his report had submitted that the price of fresh milk could not be fixed and all meetings remained unproductive due to antagonism inflexibility and rigidity of retailers, wholesaler and dairy farmers’ associations.
Some citizens had petitioned the SHC stating that the official price of per litre fresh milk was fixed at Rs94 in the provincial metropolis in 2018, but it was being sold at around Rs140 per litre in different parts of the city in violation of the notified rates and court orders while the milk association also approached the SHC.

11,The contemporary Urdu novel and Javed Siddiqui,Speakers discuss importance of the novel on the second day of Urdu Conference...,"KARACHI: The second day of the 14th International Urdu Conference organised by the Arts Council of Pakistan, Karachi began on Friday with a session on the contemporary Urdu novel. It was moderated by Syed Kashif Raza and presided over by Khalid Fateh Mohammad and Anwer Sen Roy. 
Asim Butt was the first speaker of the day. Highlighting the importance of the novel, he said in the 21st century, 15 Nobel prizes given for literature have gone to novelists. It reflects the current trend in literature. He argued that the time we live in is marked by its fast-paced life. In such as a scenario, it would have been expected that poetry would be widely discussed but on the contrary it’s the genre of the novel which is the focus of attention. It is a meaningful development. 
Mr Butt said over the years the Urdu novel has tried to align itself with the waves taking place in world literature. It needs to benefit from the novel written globally to a degree that it can go to because it will bring about newness or freshness (naey punn ka ujaal) to it. He gave the examples of the novels Aag Ka Darya and Khushion Ka Bagh as commendable efforts and also mentioned quite a few writers who are making their presence felt in Urdu literature. 

Speakers discuss importance of the novel on the second day of Urdu Conference

Mohammad Hafeez Khan said our society is marked not by change but by commotion (bhonchaal). We often witness one literary crisis or another. The novel tells the story of a whole life which is why it’s important for a novelist to have an understanding of all disciplines [necessary to tell a story]. 
Mr Khan mentioned some important names — such as Mustansar Husain Tarar and Khalid Akhtar — pointing out that quality novels have always been written in our part of the world, but then touched upon the dismemberment of East Pakistan, which in his opinion caused society to suffer ‘mental autism’. 
Rahman Abbas, who addressed the audience online from India, said it was only four or five days back that he was asked to write a thesis on literature produced by women writers for the conference. He then raised a few pertinent questions such as: is female consciousness different from human consciousness? He made the point that in history men have tried to subjugate women and have curtained their liberties. 
After his speech, a book, Waqt Ki Baag,by Khalid Fateh Mohammad was launched. Speaking about the novel, Anwer Sen Roy said it is a must-read book. 
The next speaker, who addressed the session online, was Siddique Alam from Kolkata. He perhaps read the most incisive paper of the day. He began by making an interesting remark that one could depend on fiction but not on fiction writers. He said there are more people buried in the ground than there are alive today. The world has never been an easy place to live in, and it is increasingly becoming complicated. “It wouldn’t be surprising if one fine day man turns into Kafkaesque cockroach.” 
He also gave the example of poet Ted Hughes’ poem in which he has referenced the crow in the context of modern-day man. 
Mr Alam said at least Kafka’s characters, at least, were able to create a new world for themselves. But it doesn’t seem to be the case with contemporary Urdu writers. “Today’s novel is dark,” he added. 
Najiba Arif was the last speaker of the session. She said in the last 50 years the novel has attained more importance than poetry. She added that critics [of novels] need to investigate the creative process of a novelist. 
Summing up the discussions, Khalid Fateh Mohammad said it was 150 years after Napoleon attacked Russia that Tolstoy wrote his novel. Our [Urdu] novelists write in haste. They should at least wait for 10 years for an event to absorb and become a novel. 
Book launch 
A book of short stories titled Muthi Bhar Kahaniyan by renowned Indian writer Javed Siddiqui was launched in one of the post-lunch sessions. 
Speaking on the occasion distinguished Indian film-maker, lyricist and poet Gulzar, who joined in through a video link, said Mr Siddiqui is his dear friend. Whenever he finds an Urdu word in newspapers that he’s not familiar with, he phones Mr Siddiqui to know its meaning. 
On his stories, he said they don’t just carry the stories of characters but contain the cultural atmosphere of Lucknow and Rampur. Through his tales he paints the picture of an entire culture. 
Mr Siddiqui thanked the Arts Council for publishing his collection. He felt glad that the book was being launched by poetess Zehra Nigah who he called the First Lady of Urdu Literature. 
He pointed out that apart from other human relations — blood, legal etc — he has discovered that there exists another equally powerful relationship which is to do with language — the Urdu language. 
Talking about his stories, Mr Siddiqui said he doesn’t consider himself a writer because in terms of literary journey he is just 12 years of age. Still, he feels that through his tales tries to understand the intricacies of human relationships. He thanked Gulzar sahib for not just suggesting the title of the book but also for making its cover design. 
Earlier, Mubin Mirza introduced the writer to the audience.

13,Action ordered against ‘dummy’ goths in KDA Scheme 36,KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Friday ruled that the land of Scheme 36 belonged to the Karachi Development...,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Friday ruled that the land of Scheme 36 belonged to the Karachi Development Authority (KDA) and the provincial government could not make any claim about it and directed the authorities to ensure that no encroachment would be taken place on such land in the shape of dummy goths or fake adverse claims.
A two-judge bench comprising Justice Irfan Saadat Khan and Justice Muhammad Faisal Kamal Alam deplored that the officials of provincial government were in league with those who brought false ownership claims in courts with the assistance of such officials.
It further directed the provincial and local authorities to coordinate with each other to retrieve the land of amenity plots located in Scheme-36, block 10, Gulistan-e-Jauhar as per the lay-out and master plan and asked the KDA that the same must not be misused by any person.
The bench in its judgement further said it had already been decided in earlier judgements that the entire Scheme 36 comprising 2,000 acres belonged to the KDA, which had allotted it to public at large and therefore, no adverse claim about the land in question by the Sindh government or any person other than the genuine/bona fide allottees of KDA can be accepted.
The bench passed these directives while disposing of two petitions — first one filed in 2014 against provincial authorities for attempting to convert Block 10 of Scheme 36 into Chishti Nagar Goth and encroachments on amenity plots and the second one was filed by a man in 2016 who claimed to be the headman of Chishti Nagar located in Scheme 36 seeking re-survey of the goth/village in question.
It allowed the first petition and dismissed the second for being a classic example of abuse of process of the court and imposed a cost of Rs100,000 on petitioner Rind.
The bench observed that the petitioner filed the plea by adopting deceptive tactics and concealment of facts and his acts were fraudulent and collusive with officials of provincial government as they took five years to file comments and brought the facts on record.
“An honest and fair approach on the part of the officials of provincial government, who were made respondents in these petitions, should have been taken to place on record the earlier orders of SHC and apex court in respect of scheme 36, but the officials kept quiet and attempted to drag the litigation so also the genuine grievances of the first petition,” it added.
The bench directed its office to make a caution against those who attempted to abuse the process of court by filing multiple litigations on identical issues which were already determined through judicial pronouncement and asked the registrar to take concrete steps in this regard.
It also ordered the registrar of SHC to file a report about the proposed mechanism for curtailing frivolous litigations within four weeks.
The bench said, in its earlier judgements the higher and superior judiciary had already laid down a mechanism for such disputes and had directed the chief secretary to constitute a team to undertake a comprehensive survey and if found the two goths/villages located within the territorial limits of Scheme-36, then the same would be an encroachment and liable to be removed.

The study, whose findings were disseminated at a seminar in Islamabad on Friday, was led by faculty from Aga Khan University (AKU) who partnered with Karachi’s National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD) and National Institute of Child Health (NICH), Children’s Hospital in Lahore, and Benazir Bhutto Hospital in Rawalpindi.
Researchers recruited over 1,100 children for the study who tested positive for the virus and had been admitted to the hospital for treatment. Data was collected on newborns, babies and adolescents up to between March 2020 and December 2021.
The study found that children with underlying health conditions such as malnutrition, cancer or cardiovascular disease were at a higher risk of dying from Covid-19.
The findings showed that one in five young patients with co-morbidities, or 19.5 per cent, lost their lives. Even children with a previously clean bill of health were at risk with one in eight children in Pakistan dying after contracting the virus.

Similar studies from Western countries have found below one per cent mortality rates in kids

Similar studies from Western countries have found mortality rates in kids from Covid-19 to be under one per cent.
Speakers at the seminar stated that mortality rates in the study were high due to many reasons. Firstly, since participants were recruited from hospitals they were more likely to have moderate to severe forms of Covid-19. Secondly, one-thirds of children in the study had underlying health conditions.
Early findings from the study show the main cause of death from Covid-19 was multi-system inflammatory syndrome. It typically occurs a few weeks after a child is infected with the virus. It causes vital organs such as the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs to become inflamed.
Respiratory ailments were another major cause of deadly complications from the virus. Further insights into all causes of death in the study and the most important factors that enabled children to survive are currently being compiled.
‘Not a benign disease’
Researchers noted that most deaths in the study occurred in 2021 rather than 2020 which suggests that later strains of the virus may be more deadly compared to the strain at the start of the outbreak in Pakistan.
While overall mortality from Covid-19 in children is low compared to adults, it is now clear that Covid-19 is not a benign disease in children. The virus is continuously evolving and the medical community should follow the updated treatment guidelines, said AKU’s Dr Qalab Abbas, Dr Fyezah Jehan and Dr Shazia Mohsin, the study’s principal investigators in Pakistan.
The said paediatricians around the country were now suggesting three potentially life-saving changes to treatment guidelines for critically-ill children.
Speakers at the seminar said that the WHO was yet to recommend vaccinating children under the age of 12. However, they also pointed out that this study’s results add to the body of evidence recommending vaccines for younger children with co-morbidities.
“The majority of child deaths in our study took place between the ages of one and 9,” stated Dr Abbas, Dr Mohsin and Dr Jehan. “As we conduct further analysis from our data and compare it to our partner sites in India, Ethiopia and South Africa, we will be able to provide more specific guidelines on how vaccination policies could be amended.”
The study collected data from over 5,000 children across Pakistan, India, Ethiopia and South Africa.
Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health Dr Faisal Sultan was the chief guest at the event.

15,Abbasi describes recently enacted NAB law as ambiguous,KARACHI: Former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said on Friday that the recently enacted accountability law was...,"KARACHI: Former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said on Friday that the recently enacted accountability law was so ambiguous that neither the government was aware of its effects nor courts and the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) itself knew how the graft-related cases would proceed.
Talking to newsmen after appearing before an accountability court in Karachi, the Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N) senior leader challenged the NAB chairman to inform the public about the nature of the references filed against politicians.
“There is not a single corruption reference, but all the opposition politicians have been put in jail,” he claimed and regretted that as a result they (politicians) had been attending the courts.
Mr Abbasi said two ordinances had been passed just to extend the tenure of the NAB chief. He said President Arif Alvi had sent two letters to the opposition leader in the National Assembly for consultation over the job extension of the NAB chairman. He had already got retired on Oct 6, while such consultation was being done after the lapse of two months, he added.
The PML-N leader chided that any name the incumbent government would suggest for the post of the NAB chairman would be of retired Justice Javed Iqbal because it (government) would not be able to find out any other person for the post. He also said the NAB was unable to justify its own action, adding that it had lost billions of rupees in the Broadsheet case.
He criticised Prime Minister Imran Khan for visiting Karachi to inaugurate work on the Green Line Bus Service, saying that the incumbent federal government took three years to complete the work that otherwise could have been finished in three months. 
He claimed that the former PML-N government had already paid the money of its share for the Green Line Bus Service project, but PM Khan had not disclosed that to anyone. He said it must be unearthed as to who was demanding money in the procurement of the busses for the project. Everyone knew that how many buses had been purchased and for how much price, he added.
Plea seeking case transfer
Earlier, Mr Abbasi and co-accused appeared before the accountability court, which issued notices to the counsel for the parties on an application seeking transfer of the case from the incumbent court.
Applicant Sheikh Imranul Haq submitted in the plea that the incumbent court had no jurisdiction to try the present case following an amendment made to the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999. Therefore, the case might be transferred to any other court for conducting trial proceedings.
The judge directed the counsel for the parties to argue on the plea on Jan 10, 2021 and adjourned the hearing.
The NAB had filed a reference against Mr Abbasi and former petroleum secretary Arshad Mirza for appointing Sheikh Imranul Haq as managing director and Yaqoob Sattar as deputy managing director (DMD) of the Pakistan State Oil allegedly in violation of rules and regulations.
The accountability court had indicted former PM Abbasi, Mirza, Imranul Haq and Sattar for allegedly causing a loss of Rs138.96 million to the national exchequer.
