0,Punjab Assembly speaker urges provincial govt to control inflation,"Speaker continues making statements against govt to get certain tasks accomplished, believes PTI.","LAHORE: Punjab Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Parvez Elahi has yet again asked the Punjab government to control inflation instead of merely making verbal claims, saying people have been pushed against the wall and are unable to make both ends meet. 
Speaking to a delegation led by Zubair Ahmad Khan, the PML-Q Rawalpindi president and political coordinator of the PA speaker, on Friday, Mr Elahi said the people needed relief from inflation. Islam taught humanity and giving relief to the people was a service to humanity, he said. “There is a need to formulate a comprehensive plan to control inflation,” he added. 
The PML-Q parliamentary party had last month also expressed concern over unbridled price hike and inflation and asserted that it was becoming difficult with every passing day to continue supporting the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s (PTI) Punjab and federal governments. The members had vented their anger against the governments and remarked that they were unable to face their voters. 
In the parliamentary party meeting he chaired, Mr Elahi had expressed concern over ever-increasing value of US dollar and prices of petrol, electricity and gas as well as deteriorating situation of law and order in the province.

A PML-Q spokesman had said the government had failed to solve people’s problems and was busy making issues out of non-issues. He said the situation would deteriorate further if the government did not focus on the problems. 
The PTI’s Punjab government, however, believes that Mr Elahi continues making statements against the government to pressurise it and get certain tasks accomplished. “Mr Elahi and the PML-Q parliamentary party keep criticising the PTI’s Punjab government even when all of their demands regarding transfers and postings, development packages for various districts and constituencies and provision of development funds are met,” a senior government official told Dawn on condition of anonymity. 
The government officials said the Punjab Assembly speaker had also expressed reservations over the proposed local government law, called for a briefing as the acting governor and sought certain amendments. However, he had agreed to the proposed law after a high-powered delegation met the PML-Q leader on the instruction of the chief minister. 
Mr Elahi had also raised objections to the use of electronic voting machines in the coming elections and got a joint session of parliament called off briefly, but later accepted the government’s proposal after holding negotiations with the ruling party. A PML-Q spokesman had agreed at that time the party was going with the tide. 
An insider told Dawn that the PML-Q was still making statements against the government to prepare ground to part ways with the PTI — maybe before the next elections. 
In the meeting with the PML-Q delegation, the PA speaker stressed that the provinces needed to take immediate precautionary measures in case more cases of Omicron variant of Covid-19 were detected in Karachi. 
Mr Elahi expressed confidence in Zubair Ahmad Khan and appreciated his performance. Mr Khan presented a report regarding the cantonment board elections and organisation of the party in Rawalpindi. He invited Mr Elahi to inaugurate a new party secretariat in the city. 
The delegation included Political Coordinator of Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain and PML-Q Rawalpindi general secretary, Fayyaz Tabassum, central vice president Shahbaz Goshi, Anjum Kayani, Gujjar Khan and Chaudhry Bilal Warraich.

1,US wins British court appeal paving way for Assange extradition,WikiLeaks founder’s legal team says it will ask the Supreme Court to intervene,"LONDON: The US government won an appeal on Friday against a UK court ruling that had blocked extraditing Julian Assange, paving the way for the WikiLeaks founder to be sent from Britain.
The decision by the High Court in London could now see the extradition referred to interior minister Priti Patel for final approval, but Assange’s legal team immediately said it will ask the UK Supreme Court to intervene.
The US challenged a January decision by a British magistrates’ court that it would be “oppressive” to extradite the 50-year-old Australian to the US justice system due to his mental health and the risk of suicide.
Washington wants Assange to face trial for WikiLeaks’ publication in 2010 of classified military documents relating to its wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
A two-day hearing in October saw lawyers for the United States argue that a lower court judge had not given sufficient weight to other expert testimony about his mental state.

They also pointed to diplomatic assurances provided since the January decision that Assange would not be held in punishing isolation at a federal supermax prison, and would receive appropriate care.
Approving the appeal, two judges at the High Court in London accepted the new assurances, noting they were not unusual in such cases and “solemn undertakings offered by one government to another”.
Guarantees
Summarising the decision, judge Timothy Holroyde said the district judge should have sought such guarantees herself before ruling.
He added the High Court was satisfied they ensured Assange would not face “special measures” in the US, would “receive appropriate clinical and psychological treatment” and be eligible for transfer to Australia if convicted.
“The court rejected various criticisms of those assurances which were argued on Mr Assange’s behalf and was satisfied that the assurances were sufficient to meet the concerns which led to the district judge’s decision,” Holroyde said.
The two-judge ruling ordered that the case be returned to the magistrates’ court with a direction it be sent to Patel for a final determination on extraditing Assange.
If she approves, the Wikileaks’ founder would be sent to the US within 28 days.
However, Assange’s partner Stella Moris said they would “appeal this decision at the earliest possible moment”, calling it a “grave miscarriage of justice”.
“How can it be fair, how can it be right, how can it be possible, to extradite Julian to the very country which plotted to kill him?” she said, referring to claims about a CIA plan under the Trump administration.
Birnberg Peirce Solicitors, which represent Assange, said in a statement that “his lawyers will be seeking permission to appeal this decision to the Supreme Court”, noting they have 14 days to do so.
Cannibalistic worldview
The long-running case has become a cause celebre for free speech, with Assange’s supporters arguing WikiLeaks has the same rights as other media to publish secret material in the public interest.
Speaking outside court, Moris said the case was a “vindictive prosecution against a journalist”.
“This goes to the fundamentals of press freedom and democracy,” she said, accusing Britain of acting on behalf of a foreign power. Russia, suspected of hacking 2016 US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign and handing materials to WikiLeaks, called the ruling “shameful”.
Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova called it “a political case against a journalist and public figure -- another manifestation of the cannibalistic worldview of the Anglo-Saxon alliance”.
Amnesty International also questioned the US assurances over Assange’s future treatment, calling them “inherently unreliable”.
