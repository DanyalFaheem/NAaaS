• 45pc citizens satisfied with portal’s performance
• Dedicated category of corruption/malpractice added    
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Citizen Portal (PCP) has registered over 3.7 million people since it was launched in 2018, with the total number of complaints received on it having crossed the 4.2 million mark. 
According to the Prime Minister’s Performance Delivery Unit (PMDU), which runs the portal, 45 per cent citizens have expressed their satisfaction over the performance of the portal.
One such example is of Gudi Bibi, a sanitary worker who retired from a women’s university in Rawalpindi. She found relief within 24 hours of submitting her complaint. 
A senior PMDU official told Dawn on Friday that Gudi Bibi, 61, had retired from the university last year but did not receive her dues even after a year.
She then lodged a complaint with the PCP on Thursday after which the portal took up the matter with the varsity’s management, the PMDU official said, adding that the management, however, claimed that the woman’s appointment was illegal and, therefore, she was not eligible for any relief.
At this, the PCP observed that if her appointment was illegal, why was she allowed to work for 32 years. Finally on Friday, the woman received a cheque for Rs179,078.
“Now we will take action against the university staff who intentionally delayed release of her dues,” the official said.      
According to the PMDU, a record increase in registered members has been witnessed on the portal.
The monthly data released by the PM’s Performance Delivery Unit on Friday showed that 4.4 million complaints were filed with the portal, of which 4.2 million were from within the country and 215,000 lodged by overseas Pakistanis.
The number of registered individuals from Punjab is 2.2 million, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 600,000 and Sindh, 500,000. As many as 51,000 people have registered from Balochistan and 77,000 from Islamabad Capital Territory, the data revealed. 
The PMDU said that so far four million complaints had been addressed.
According to Prime Minister Imran Khan, Pakistan Citizen Portal app was declared the second best government mobile application in the world at the World Government Summit in Dubai.
He had said 4,646 mobile applications of different categories were submitted by 87 countries at the summit earlier this week. Indonesia came out on top while the United States bagged the third spot. 
PM Khan had said the complaint receiving system was unprecedented, which none of the earlier prime ministers had initiated. 
The Prime Minister’s Performance Delivery Unit has recently added a dedicated category of corruption/malpractice in the already existing categories in the portal’s complaint-lodging mechanism to eradicate corruption and improve performance of bureaucracy.
The category of ‘corruption/malpractices’ has been further classified into six sub-categories. They are: financial corruption, violation of merit/rules, power abuse, fraud/forgery, harassment and inefficiency.
The classification of these various sub kinds has been keenly devised, keeping in view the nature of complaints received on the portal. Matters regarding corruption in government funds, bribery and kickbacks fall under financial corruption, whereas irregularities in recruitment, procurement and allotment processes qualify for violation of merit/rules category. Similarly, favouritism and unauthorised privileges represent the power abuse section. 
The activation of the ‘corruption/malpractices’ option will not only help filter out frivolous complaints, but also help the officers entertain genuine complaints.

1,Massive rally in Gwadar for demands acceptance,Protest leader terms participation of thousands a referendum against the provincial and federal governments.,"GWADAR: Tens of thousands of people, including women and children, marched on the main roads and streets of Gwadar on Friday in support of their movement launched for the rights of the people of Gwadar.
Led by Maulana Hidayat-ur-Rehman, Balochistan gen­­eral secretary of Ja­­m­a­at-i-Islami, the people of the port city launched the ‘Gwa­dar ko haq do’ movement 26 days ago. 
The participants of the procession started their march from Seratun-Nabi Chowk, carrying placards and banners inscribed with slogans in support of their demands. They were chanting slogans against the provincial government.
Speaking to the participants, Maulana Hidayat said police and other law-enforcement agen­cies blocked the Coas­tal Highway at Uthal, stopping buses, coaches and other vehicles carrying people to travel towards Gwadar as thousands of people from Karachi and other areas of Sindh wanted to join the sit-in in Gwadar. 
Maulana Hidayat said that today’s participation of hundreds of thousands of people in the procession and the sit-in was actually a referendum against the provincial and federal governments and the people would continue their struggle and protest till the achievement of their rights which had been denied to them for a long time. 
“It is the movement of the deprived and oppressed people of Balochistan comprising fishermen, poor labourers and students, which will continue till all their demands are accepted and implemented,” the JI leader declared.

2,ADB okays $685m loans for Pakistan,Asian lender approves $300m for energy sector and $385m for five KP cities,"ISLAMABAD: The Asian Develop­ment Bank (ADB) has approved two policy and project loans worth $685 million for Pakistan’s energy sector reforms and improvement of health and civic facilities.
Under the first loan, the Manila-based lending agency will provide a $300m policy-based lending to support financial, technical and governance reforms to strengthen the country’s energy sector and improve its financial sustainability, the ADB said in a statement issued on Friday.
The financing is part of the second sub-programme of ADB’s Energy Sec­tor Reforms and Financial Sustain­ability Programme, which aims to improve the governance of Pakistan’s energy sector and reduce and manage the accumulated cash shortfall across the power supply chain known as circular debt. The first sub-programme under the $300m financing was approved in December 2019.
“This programme will help facilitate public and private sector investment across the energy sector value chain through key policies and integrated planning and will help expand renewable energy generation,” said Yevgeniy Zhukov, ADB Director General for Central and West Asia. 

Asian lender approves $300m for energy sector and $385m for five KP cities

The statement said the disruption from the Covid-19 pandemic stressed the finances and supply chains of Pakistan’s energy sector, slowing the pace of sector reforms initiated by the government in 2019. Losses incurred by state-owned enterprises that impacted the energy sector’s circular debt, together with pandemic relief measures, put unprecedented pressure on the energy sector’s liquidity and finances.
Reforms under the ADB programme will help make the country’s energy sector more financially sustainable by addressing inefficient tariffs and subsidies, high generation costs, system losses, and a lack of integrated planning. The programme also aims to enhance energy infrastructure and professionalise the management of energy entities to improve their performance, the ADB said.

The programme also aims to enhance energy infrastructure and professionalise the management of energy entities to improve their performance.
“ADB continues to work with development partners to advance crucial energy sector reforms and implement a road map for a competitive electricity market,” said Joonho Hwang, ADB Director for Energy for Central and West Asia. “Ultimately, these reforms will help improve the quality and reliability of power supply to the benefit of all — commercial, domestic, urban, and rural consumers.”
Project for five KP cities
The second loan worth $385m is targeted to improve the liveability and community health of five cities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa — Abbottabad, Kohat, Mardan, Mingora and Peshawar. 
The KP Cities Improvement Project will help construct two clean water supply treatment facilities, three sewerage treatment facilities, and rehabilitate dysfunctional tubewells among several other important subprojects.
More than 3.5m people will benefit from improved access to clean and safe water, reliable and integrated waste management and sanitation services, green urban spaces and gender-friendly urban facilities, the ADB statement said, adding that about 150,000 households will gain new connections to water supply systems and have smart water meters installed in their homes.
With its rapidly growing urban population, KP “is becoming more exposed to health risks due to deteriorating municipal services and the impacts of climate change”, the Asian Bank said, adding that this project will help address these challenges of urban centres through strong, climate-resilient urban infrastructure combined with access to reliable services to benefit people, the environment and support sustainable development.
“This project has used ADB’s project readiness financing facility to ensure detailed engineering design, safeguards assessments, and other critical preparatory work was completed in advance — a first for the central and west Asia region. That will ensure the transformative benefits of this project will flow to the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province more quickly,” Mr Zhukov said.
The ADB will provide a $380m loan and a $5m grant, while the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank will provide co-financing of $200m, subject to approval of their board of directors. Together with $65m in financing from the government of Pakistan, this represents ADB’s largest urban project (equivalent to $650m) in the country. 
ADB’s loan includes more than $106m for climate adaptation and mitigation, the bank’s largest climate financing contribution in any urban project in 2021, reaffirming its commitment to helping its developing member countries fight climate change.

3,"PML-N wants probe into scuffle between Rangers, workers",Claims PTI government has not completed even a single new project.,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz on Friday asked the Rangers authorities to conduct an inquiry into Thursday’s scuffle between Rangers and PML-N leaders and workers at the Karachi Green Line track in Nazimabad. 
Speaking at a press conference just before inauguration of the bus project by the prime minister, PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb said Imran Khan was inaugurating a project that was launched by Nawaz Sharif. 
She claimed that the incumbent government had not completed even a single new project. 
Ms Aurangzeb condemned alleged high- handed attitude meted out to PML-N leaders Ahsan Iqbal, Mohammad Zubair and Miftah Ismail who wanted to hold a symbolic inauguration of the project in Karachi’s Nazimabad area on Thursday. 
Ms Aurangzeb said if batons were used on political workers, more incidents like the Sialkot lynching would take place in the country. 
She accused the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government of embezzlement in the Covid-19 fund and the Benazir Income Support Programme, renamed as Ehsaas Programme. 
Several PML-N workers, led by Ahsan Iqbal, and Rangers personnel came face to face on Thursday when the paramilitary troops prevented the PML-N leader from performing symbolic inauguration of the Green Line bus service at the project site, leading to a brawl between the two sides. 
It all began when PML-N workers in line with the plan to hold a “symbolic opening” of the project started converging at one of the bus stations in North Nazimabad and were later joined by senior leaders, including Ahsan Iqbal, Mohammad Zubair and Miftah Ismail. 
Amid slogans and in charged atmosphere, the PML-N leaders and workers, however, were stopped by a heavy contingent of Rangers from moving towards a pedestrian bridge where the party had arranged a stage for the ceremony. 
Led by their leaders, the PML workers faced resistance from the Rangers personnel carrying sticks. The situation turned tense when Mr Iqbal came forward and started arguing with a paramilitary officer, insisting on exercising his democratic and legal rights. 
At this moment, the scuffle between the two sides intensified and amid slogans and noise of the workers, the paramilitary troops stopped the PML-N activists forcibly. 
In the process, the PML-N claimed, Rangers resorted to baton-charge that left Mr Iqbal and a woman worker injured.  
The party workers dispersed and the ceremony was called off, but the PML-N leaders addressed the media at the site. They termed the Rangers’ action “state terrorism” and urged the military leadership to take notice of it.  
Ms Aurangzeb said that according to a report of the Transparency International, 66.66 per cent people, who took part in a survey, said that the accountability process was not transparent, while over 86pc people did not believe in self-accountability of the government. 
She said that corruption perception level in the country was at its peak and the PTI leaders even did not spare Covid-19 funds from their loot and plunder.

According to sources, the ICAO team’s visit was comprehensive and tough this time, but apparently they didn’t observe anything critical. Their main focus was on pilot licensing, airworthiness and HR structure.  
The ICAO audit team members also visited Islamabad International Airport where they observed the process of departure of Pakistan International Airlines’ (PIA) domestic flight PK-300, security, cargo terminal, safety investigation board and other areas.  
The sources said the ICAO experts had been conducting the audit of security, pilot licensing, training and the areas where they had concerns previously. The team has also been conducting the audit of airworthiness of aircraft, aerodromes and ground aids, the aviation’s aircraft accident investigation board and the engineering department.
A spokesman for the PCAA said the ICAO experts had completed the USOAP (Universal Safety Oversight Audit Programme) audit of the authority on Friday. The audit report was quite positive, with no substantial problems, as a result of unwavering efforts over a year, he claimed.  
In the closing session, the ICAO audit team appreciated the progress made by the PCAA and commended the preparation and hard work prior to the audit, the spokesman said, adding that as per the ICAO procedures, a formal report would be issued in a few weeks and shared publicly.  
Meanwhile, the PCAA and the United Kingdom’s Department for Transport (DfT) performed a comprehensive joint inspection of selected airports in Pakistan as part of the flight security preparations. This was part of an agreement between the two governments on direct flights from Pakistan by British airlines.  
The DfT team had conducted a comprehensive audit of Lahore and Islamabad airports from November 22 to Dec­ember 2 this year, including flight security arrangements. The team observed different things and remarked 100 per cent compliance all together and outstanding efforts from the PIA security side at Islamabad and Lahore stations.

5,Country’s lonely collector of antique clocks,Kakar is ready to donate everything if someone agrees to set up a museum in his name,"QUETTA: The tick-tock of hundreds of antique clocks fills a small hall in the provincial capital, where collector Gul Kakar swears he will spend all the time he has left caring for them. 
Delicate wristwatches, weighty pocket pieces and battered table models clutter every surface, while the pendulums of wall-mounted and standalone grandfather clocks sway as their deep bongs mark each new hour. 
“I know their language,” Kakar, a 44-year-old police officer, says during a visit to his collection. “They tell me their problems, and I understand.” 
Kakar’s collection, some of which dates back to 1850, is housed inside the city’s police headquarters compound. 
That means they are behind heavy gates and high concrete blast walls in a province that for years has been rife with ethnic, sectarian and other violence. 

Kakar is ready to donate everything if someone agrees to set up a museum in his name

The tight security may contribute to the lack of traffic, though Kakar admits he has found few other aficionados to admire his museum and there are hardly any visitors. 
“People in Quetta don’t show much interest,” he confesses. 
Kakar’s obsession began decades ago, when two family clocks fell out of order and were sent for repairs. 
“I started taking an interest... then I got the idea that I should get more clocks.” 
Soon he began collecting in earnest and his museum today is the result of more than 18 years of scouring the internet for antiques — even persuading friends overseas to buy secondhand pieces and ship them to him. 
He has also lost count of how many he has — or how much he spends on his collection — but income from a family-run landholding means a “major portion” of his police salary goes to clocks. 
Oldest clock 
“For as long as I am alive, I will take care of them,” says Kakar, dressed in a smart black vest and carrying a brass-topped walking stick. 
He admits, however, that nobody in his family shares the passion, and that after his death, the collection may simply be sold. 
He is ready to donate everything if an official or the private sector steps in to fund a museum in his name. “I have not so far received any such offer,” he admits. 
Despite all the pieces, he still yearns for one last item — a grandfather clock similar to a famed 19th-century timepiece kept in Jacobabad, in Sindh province. 
That clock — said by some to be the oldest in what is present-day Pakistan — was handmade in 1847 by John Jacob, the East India Company colonial administrator who gave the town its name. 
Kakar lights up as he explains the mechanism of the clock, whose pendulum is sunk 32 feet deep in a well. 
He has never seen it, but is keen to have it. “I would give up my entire collection for that one.”

6,"Two held for raping, blackmailing two sisters","Govt to ensure culprits are awarded exemplary punishment, says chief minister","QUETTA: Two men have been arrested for raping two sisters, filming their videos, posting it on internet and blackmailing them.      
Deputy Inspector General of Quetta police Fida Hussain Shah said that after receiving a complaint, police had arrested the prime accused Hidayatullah Khilji and his brother Khalil Khilji while raids were being conducted for the arrest of third accused Shani.  
Speaking at a press conference on Friday, the DIG said that on Dec 2 a woman lodged a complaint at Quaidabad police station alleging that Hidayatullah and his brother had kidnapped her two daughters two years ago, filmed their objectionable videos and were blackmailing them after posting the videos on internet.   
“Police arrested both accused and later recovered mobile phones, a laptop, a tablet and other electronic devices used for making videos,” the DIG said.   
He said that another woman had also lodged   a similar complaint against the accused and a special team headed by a senior police officer had been constituted to conduct the investigation.  

Govt to ensure culprits are awarded exemplary punishment, says chief minister

He said that police had involved the Federal Investi­gation Agency in the investigation and sent the electronic devices, lap-top and mobile phones to a forensic laboratory in Punjab for their forensic test.  
“The victim girls have gone to Afghanistan and we are contacting Afghan auth­o­rities through Foreign Off­ice for their return,” he said.  
The DIG denied any political pressure on police, saying: “We are not facing any pressure regarding the investigation.”   
Meanwhile, Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo has said that the government will fulfill its responsibility to ensure that the accused and their associates are awarded exemplary punishment as it is a deplorable and shameful act which the government will not tolerate.  
He was talking to a delegation of the National Reform Committee of the civil society, led by Allama Ali Hussnain and Hazara Democratic Party secretary general Ahmed Kohzad, which called on him.   
The delegation informed the chief minister about the concern of the members of civil society and other people and said that the kidnapping of the girls and posting their objectionable videos on internet had shaken the society.  
CM Bizenjo said that the government had taken notice of the shameful crime. 
“Balochistan has its own traditions and values which give respect to our mothers and sisters and our society does not tolerate such shameful acts.”   
He said that the government would play its due role in reforming the society along with the civil society.  
He received information about the progress in the investigation through a telephone call to the DIG and told him that the prosecution should make a strong case against the accused so that they were awarded maximum punishment by the court of law and in future no one could think of playing with the honor of girls.

8,Killing over unproven blasphemy allegation not allowed: ulema,‘Day of condemnation’ against Sri Lankan man's lynching observed in mosques across the country.,"ISLAMABAD: Ulema in their Friday sermons vociferously condemned recent lynching of a Sri Lankan national in Sialkot and said the killing of any person over unsubstantiated blasphemy accusations is not permissible in any circumstances. 
The ‘day of condemnation’ was observed in mosques across the country on Friday. The religious leadership stressed that all sections of society had to come out against the extremist mindset and extremist thinking. 
Special Representative of the Prime Minister on Reli­gious Harmony Hafiz Tahir Ashrafi and other prayer lea­ders in their Friday sermons said that the entire nation was united and agreed on punishment to the perpetrators of the Sialkot tragedy. 
According to the ulema, the courts have the authority to punish the perpetrator of blasphemy and taking law into one’s hands is not permissible according to Sharia and law of the land. 
Mr Ashrafi said the lynching of the Sri Lankan national had embarrassed the entire nation. A person accused of blasphemy should be brought to justice and a complaint should be lodged with police and then one should wait for a court decision. Elements involved in making blasphemy allegations for their vested objectives would also be punished under the blasphemy law, he added.  
He said the leadership of religions and religious schools of thought agreed to launch a nationwide public campaign against extremism.

9,FPCCI warns further interest rate hike to cause stagflation,KARACHI: Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) President  Mian Nasser Hyatt Magoo has...,"KARACHI: Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) President  Mian Nasser Hyatt Magoo has asked the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) not to further increase the interest rate as it would result in the stagflation and adverse effects on industrial growth. 
He said that the use of the instrument of policy rate for controlling inflation has been counter-productive as Pakistan’s economy is less integrated with the financial sector. 
Mr Magoo in  a statement on Friday said the Policy Advisory Board of the FPCCI, headed by former federal secretary Mohammad Younus Dagha, has published a policy brief titled ‘Assessment of Monetary Policy Effectiveness in Pakistan’ which formulates the apex chamber’s input for the upcoming monetary policy. 
The paper gives as insight into the causes of inflation and the effectiveness of monetary policy based on the analysis of economic fundamentals, business cycle positioning, and the monetary policy survey for which the respondents were economists, financial market participants and industry representatives.
He said the report finds that only seven per cent of the commercial entities do actually borrow from the banking and financial system of the country and this fact renders the monetary tightening for inflation control and management through increasing policy rate ineffectual and restricts its efficacy as a tool.
The report warns that Pakistan is heading towards stagflation with inflation mounted to 11.5pc whereas the core inflation was recorded at 7.6pc in November. The SBP increased the policy rates by 25 basis points and 150 basis points during the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meetings held in September and November, respectively. This has created a speculative momentum that raised cut-off yields by 228 basis points for three-month T-bills to 10.78pc. 
It is imperative to note here that supply shocks such as a hike in commodity and oil prices provided the impetus for current inflationary pressure. In addition, massive rupee depreciation against the dollar along with measures under the IMF programme have aggravated inflation further. Although the real interest rate is negative in Pakistan, the difference between policy rates and core inflation is higher in the country 1.2pc as compared to India (-1.8pc) and China (0.7pc).
The report recommends to the SBP target core inflation rather than general inflation. Moreover, inflationary pressure can be better controlled by shifting the exchange rate regime from flexible to a managed float. The government should also use regulations and effective enforcement to counter speculations and manipulations by cartels that are playing havoc with the prices and exchange rates.
