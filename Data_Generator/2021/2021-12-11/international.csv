0,France to open Algerian files 15 years before time,They are likely to confirm the widespread use of torture and extra-judicial killings by French forces.,"PARIS: France will open classified police files from the Algerian war 15 years ahead of schedule in order to “look the truth in the eyes”, the government announced on Friday.  
The files cover criminal investigations during the 1954-1962 war of independence and are likely to confirm the widespread use of torture and extra-judicial killings by French forces.
“We have things to rebuild with Algeria. They can only be rebuilt on the truth,” said Culture Minister Roselyne Bachelot on BFMTV.
“I want this question — which is troubling, aggravating, and where falsifiers of history are at work — I want us to be able to look it in the eyes. We can’t build a national story on a lie,” she added.
The announcement comes as France seeks to defuse a major diplomatic crisis between the two countries.
It was triggered in October when President Emmanuel Macron accused Algeria’s “political-military system” of rewriting history and fomenting “hatred towards France”.
‘Never fear the truth’
The trauma of the Algerian War has poisoned French politics for the past 60 years.
A key strand of today’s far-right nationalism has its roots in the war and then-president Charles de Gaulle’s abrupt decision to grant Algeria independence in 1962 — for which he faced assassination bids and attempted military coups.
Asked about the likelihood that incidents of torture will be uncovered in the archives, Bachelot said: “It is in the interest of the country that they are recognised. “We should never fear the truth. We must put it in context.” 
Historians have previously been able to request access to the archives, held in the southern city of Aix-en-Provence, but the procedure was lengthy and often blocked on national security grounds. The declassification is not expected to include the army’s files.
Macron, France’s first leader born after the colonial era, has made a priority of reckoning with its past and forging a new relationship with former colonies.
He has recognised the killing of anti-colonial activists by French forces during the war, including Algerian lawyer Ali Boumendjel and communist activist Maurice Audin.
Macron also in October condemned “inexcusable crimes” during a 1961 crackdown against Algerian pro-independence protesters in Paris, during which police led by a former Nazi collaborator killed dozens of demonstrators and threw their bodies into the river Seine.
No apology
Karim Amellal, a scholar appointed as ambassador to the Mediterranean region by Macron, welcomed the move to open the files as “extremely positive”.
“There is a very strong demand from historians to declassify documents covered by national security. We can’t follow a policy of remembrance without following the path traced by these historians,” he said.
Macron has, however, ruled out an official apology for France’s actions — seeing such a move as a gift to far-right opponents in next year’s presidential election.
Meanwhile, his criticisms of the Algerian government in October have turned always-thorny relations into a full-blown crisis.
It did not help that Macron questioned whether Algeria had existed as a nation before the French invasion in the 1800s.
And it came just a month after France sharply reduced visa quotas for North African citizens.
Algeria has responded by withdrawing its ambassador and banning French military planes from its airspace, which they regularly use for anti-jihadist operations in the region.

1,US imposes sanctions on China’s Artificial Intelligence firm,America accuses firm of having developed facial recognition programmes that can determine a target's ethnicity.,"WASHINGTON: The United States on Friday imposed extensive human rights-related sanctions on dozens of people and entities tied to China, Myanmar, North Korea and Bangladesh, and added Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) company SenseTime Group to an investment blacklist.
Canada and the United Kingdom joined the United States in imposing sanctions related to human rights abuse in Myanmar, while Washington also imposed the first new sanctions on North Korea under President Joe Biden’s administration and targeted Myanmar military entities, among others, in action marking Human Rights Day.
“Our actions today, particularly those in partnership with the United Kingdom and Canada, send a message that democracies around the world will act against those who abuse the power of the state to inflict suffering and repression,” Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said in the statement.
The North Korean mission at the United Nations and the Chinese, Myanmar and Bangladesh embassies in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The US Treasury Department in a statement said it added Chinese artificial intelligence company SenseTime to a list of “Chinese military-industrial complex companies”, accusing it of having developed facial recognition programs that can determine a target's ethnicity, with a particular focus on identifying ethnic Uyghurs.

2,54 die after truck smuggling migrants crashes in Mexico,More than 100 people were inside the trailer.,"TUXTLA GUTIERREZ: Fifty-four migrants, mostly from Guatemala, were killed on Thursday when the truck they were in flipped over in southern Mexico, in one of the worst accidents involving Central Americans who risk their lives to reach the United States.
The trailer broke open, spilling out people, when the truck crashed on a sharp curve outside the city of Tuxtla Gutierrez in the state of Chiapas.
Chiapas Governor Rutilio Escan­don said 49 people died at the scene, and five more while receiving medical attention.
“It took a bend, and because of the weight of us people inside, we all went with it,” said a shocked-looking Guatemalan man sitting at the scene in footage broadcast on social media.
“The trailer couldn’t handle the weight of people.”  
More than 100 people were inside the trailer, authorities said. 
The migrants inside the tipped-over trailer were tossed and crushed in a pile of both the living and the dead.
Volunteer rescuers removed the dead from the pile, while the living scrambled to get out of the twisted debris of the collapsed trailer.
One young man, pinned beneath unmoving bodies, wriggled to free the lower half of his frame, his face wrenched into a grimace as he extracted himself. Nearby, a man blinked, unable to move as he lay on the side of the road. Next to him was an older, stouter migrant whose lifeless eyes stared into the setting sun.
While the Mexican government is trying to appease the United States by stopping caravans of walking migrants and allowing the reinstatement of the Remain in Mexico policy, it has been unable to staunch the flood of migrants stuffed by the hundreds into trucks operated by smugglers who charge thousands of dollars to take them to the US. border trips that all too often lead them only to their deaths.
The most severely injured from the accident were carried to plastic sheets on the road. Those who could walk were led, stunned, to the same sheets. Ambulances, cars and pickup trucks were pressed into ferrying the injured to hospitals.
Later, the dead were covered in white sheets, side by side, on the highway. Rescue workers who first arrived said other migrants who had been on the truck when it crashed had fled for fear of being detained by immigration agents. One paramedic said some of those who hurried into surrounding neighborhoods were bloodied or bruised but still limped away in their desperation to escape.
About 200 migrants may have been packed into the truck, said Guatemala’s top human rights official Jordn Rodas. That number is not unusual for migrant smuggling operations in Mexico, and the weight of the load combined with speed and a nearby curve may have been enough to throw the truck off balance, authorities said.
Luis Manuel Moreno, head of the Chiapas state civil defence office, said 21 were seriously injured and were taken to hospitals. The federal Attorney General’s Office said three were critically injured in the crash, which happened on a highway leading from the Guatemalan border toward the Chiapas state capital.
Sitting beside the overturned trailer, Celso Pacheco of Guatemala said the truck felt like it was speeding and then seemed out of control.
Most aboard were from Guatemala and Honduras, he said, estimating eight to 10 young children among them. He said he was trying to reach the United States, but now expected to be deported to Guatemala. Authorities said there also were migrants from Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Mexico aboard.
Marco Antonio Snchez, director of the Chiapas Firefighter Institute, said ambulances brought victims to three hospitals, three or four at a time.

3,Russia urges Nato to rescind promise to Ukraine and Georgia,"Says it is in ""fundamental interests of European security"".","MOSCOW: Russia called upon Nato on Friday rescind a 2008 commitment to Ukraine and Georgia that they would one day become members and said the alliance should promise not to deploy weapons in countries bordering Russia that could threaten its security.
The demands were spelt out by the Russian foreign ministry in its fullest statement yet on the security guarantees that President Vladimir Putin says he wants to obtain from the United States and its allies.
“In the fundamental interests of European security, it is necessary to formally disavow the decision of the 2008 Nato Bucharest summit that ‘Ukraine and Georgia will become Nato members’,” the ministry said in a statement.
Ukraine is at the centre of a crisis in East-West relations as it accuses Russia of massing tens of thousands of troops in preparation for a possible large-scale military offensive.
Russia denies planning any attack, but accuses Ukraine and the United States of destabilising behaviour, and has said it needs security guarantees for its own protection.
The ministry statement followed a video call between Putin and US President Joe Biden this week that was dominated by discussion of Ukraine. 
The foreign ministry said Moscow was proposing a series of steps to reduce tensions, including safe distances between Russian and Nato warships and planes, especially in the Baltic and Black Seas.

4,Afghans seek help for women back home before it’s too late,Fear for family members still in Afghanistan haunts the Afghan evacuees.,"GOLEM: Women who were evacuated to Albania after the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan are urging the international community to pay attention to the plight of Afghan women and girls still living in an environment of severe gender-based discrimination.
Some 550 evacuated Afghans are in the Albanian coastal town of Golem, 50 kilometers west of the capital Tirana. For more than two weeks, women in the group wrote articles, posted social media messages and contacted foreign authorities and organizations to remind people about the worsening conditions in Afghanistan. Unless the world pays attention to the dire situation of the Afghan women now without a job, isolated at home, no prospects ahead tomorrow it will be too late, Masoud Faizy, 48, a gynecologist who was research director at the Malali Maternity Hospital in Kabul, said Friday.
Faizy said friends she has communicated with told her life had become unbearable since Western troops left Afghanistan and the Taliban took over running the country in August.
Shamail Zarei, a board member of the Afghan Womens Network said the public awareness campaign in Albania arose out of such conversations. Reports from Afghanistan say the Taliban has closed schools for girls and barred women from working or attending universities.
How could we fight, our friends back home tell us, who do not take easy our call for them to fight at a time that we already left the country, Zarei told The Associated Press.
Zarei’s younger sister Sabera, 21, who had been studying law in Afghanistan, said her classmates were  “depressed and disappointed after the rushing move out by the U.S. Army.
Fear for family members still in Afghanistan haunts the Afghan evacuees, who are waiting in Albania for authorization to move to the United States and other countries. Setara Golzari, 15, said the school she had attended in Herat, Afghanistan, was closed by the Taliban.
Why do they hate women? she asked.
Golzari called on the U.S. government to speed up the visa process for her family, saying her mother suffers from a serious illness that has gone untreated for the last month in Albania.
She doesn't have the proper diet and we are not finding the medicine she uses and she is suffering a lot, the teenager said.
Albania has sheltered a total of 2,250 Afghan evacuees in hotels and resorts around the Balkan nation. They have been told they will have to stay there for about a year until U.S. authorities finish processing their special immigration visas.
Albania has offered medical assistance to all Afghan evacuees. Albanian doctors. however, often ask for private payments because the Afghans are not listed as having medical insurance.

5,Macron hails ‘convergence of views’ after meeting German chancellor,"The visit was “a very important moment to build solid foundations for cooperation between our countries”, he says.","PARIS: French President Emmanuel Macron hailed a “convergence of views” with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Friday as the two men met for their first talks as leaders. Macron and Scholz, both pro-EU centrists, are the new tandem in charge of Europe’s biggest economies that have the greatest influence inside the 27-member European Union.
Scholz, a Social Democrat, heads a new coalition whose commitment to strengthening Europe’s “strategic sovereignty” has raised hopes of progress in the fervently pro-EU French government.
Addressing Scholz as “dear Olaf” and using the informal “tu” pronoun in French, Macron said he had seen “a convergence of views, a desire to have our countries work together, and a firm and determined belief in Europe, which I knew already, which we will need in the months and years ahead.” 
The visit was “a very important moment to build solid foundations for cooperation between our countries,” he added at a news conference.
Scholz made Paris his first overseas stop after taking over on Wednesday from Angela Merkel at the end of her 16 years in power. He said the talks focused on “making Europe strong and European sovereignty… What is important there is that we work together.”
Scholz will continue on to Brussels on Friday for talks with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on Friday, as well as European Council president Charles Michel ahead of a bloc summit next week.

6,"US tech giants fuelling ‘toxic sludge’ on social media, says Nobel winner",Co-laureate calls for a minute of silence during Nobel ceremony to honour all journalists killed in the line of duty.,"OSLO: Accepting her Nobel Peace Prize on Friday, Filipina journalist Maria Ressa launched a vitriolic attack against US tech giants, accusing them of fuelling a flood of “toxic sludge” on social media.  
Ressa, the co-founder of news website Rappler, accepted this year’s prize at a ceremony at Oslo’s City Hall together with her co-laureate Dmitry Muratov, the editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta, one of the rare independent newspapers in a Russian media landscape largely under state control.
Speaking to a scaled-down crowd due to the pandemic, 58-year-old Ressa attacked “American internet companies” such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube without mentioning them by name.
“With its god-like power”, their technology “has allowed a virus of lies to infect each of us, pitting us against each other, bringing out our fears, anger and hate, and setting the stage for the rise of authoritarians and dictators around the world,” she said.
“Our greatest need today is to transform that hate and violence, the toxic sludge that’s coursing through our information ecosystem, prioritised by American internet companies that make more money by spreading that hate and triggering the worst in us,” she said.
Ressa stressed the importance of reliable facts at a time when the world is battling the Covid-19 pandemic or facing upcoming elections in countries like France, the United States, the Philippines and Hungary.
These companies “are biased against facts, biased against journalists. They are — by design — dividing us and radicalising us,” she said.
Ressa, a vocal critic of Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte and his deadly drug war, is herself facing seven criminal lawsuits in her country, which she said could see her sent to prison for 100 years.
Currently on bail pending an appeal against a conviction last year in a cyber libel case, she had to apply to four courts for permission to travel to Norway for Friday’s ceremony.
Minute of silence
Her co-laureate Muratov, 60, meanwhile called for a minute of silence during the Nobel ceremony to honour all journalists killed in the line of duty.
“I want journalists to die old,” he said.
Known for its investigations into corruption and human rights abuses in Chechnya, Novaya Gazeta has seen six of its journalists killed since the 1990s, including famed investigative reporter Anna Politkovskaya, murdered in 2006.
“Journalism in Russia is going through a dark time,” Muratov said in his acceptance speech, noting that over 100 journalists, media outlets, human rights defenders and NGOs have recently been branded as “foreign agents” by Russia’s justice ministry.
The “foreign agent” label is meant to apply to people or groups that receive funding from abroad and are involved in any kind of “political activity”.
But it has also been given to Kremlin-critical journalists and media, making their work exceedingly difficult.
While Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that the Nobel was not a “shield” protecting journalists, Muratov said he did not expect his newspaper to be given the status.
“During the 30 years lifetime that our newspaper has had, we have done so much positive and good for the country that announcing us as foreign agents would be deteriorating for the country’s power” and “a stupid thing to do,” he told AFP in an interview.
Record number of jailed journalists
According to a report compiled by Reporters Without Borders up to Dec 1, at least 1,636 journalists have been killed around the world in the past 20 years, including 46 since the beginning of the year.
In addition, the number of journalists imprisoned around the world has never been higher, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, with 293 currently behind bars.
“Bringing the story to the public may in itself be a prevention of war,” the chairwoman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Berit Reiss-Andersen, said.
“The role of the press is to reveal aggression and abuse of power, thereby contributing to peace.” The Oslo ceremony also saw the head of the World Food Programme, the 2020 Peace Prize laureate, give his Nobel lecture. Last year’s festivities had been cancelled due to the pandemic.
This year’s other Nobel laureates in the fields of medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and economics would normally receive their prizes at a separate ceremony in Stockholm on Friday.
But due to the Covid situation, they received their awards in their hometowns earlier this week.
A ceremony was to be held in their honour in the Swedish capital later Friday, attended by the royal family.

7,Nicaragua switches diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China,The announcement leaves Taipei with just 14 diplomatic allies,"MANAGUA: Nicaragua inked a deal on Friday switching diplomatic allegiance from Taiwan to China in a political coup for Beijing as it seeks to isolate the democratic island it has vowed to one day seize.
The announcement leaves Taiwan with just 14 diplomatic allies but comes as Taipei strengthens ties with multiple unofficial Western friends including the United States.
China has spent decades encouraging Taiwan’s dwindling diplomatic allies to switch sides, including three others in Latin America in recent years — Panama, El Salvador and the Dominican Republic.
On Thursday, the administration of Daniel Ortega announced that Nicaragua was following suit.
“The People’s Republic of China is the only legitimate government representing all of China, and Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory,” Foreign Minister Denis Moncada said.

The announcement leaves Taipei with just 14 diplomatic allies

Ortega’s son Laureano Facundo Ortega Murillo led a delegation of Nicaraguan officials who signed a joint communique on Friday in the Chinese city of Tianjin establishing ties.
“This is a correct choice that conforms to broader trends and people’s aspirations. China highly commends this,” Beijing’s foreign ministry said.
Taiwan pain 
Taiwan expressed “heartfelt pain and regret” but it also vowed to continue building alliances elsewhere.
President Tsai Ing-wen dismissed Nicaragua’s rebuff.
“The more international support we have, there will be more pressure from the authoritarian camp,” she told reporters. In response to Nicaragua’s move the US called on “all countries that value democratic institutions” to “expand engagement with Taiwan”.
China’s Communist Party leaders claim Taiwan as part of their territory and have vowed to one day take the island, by force if needed.
Relations between the two sides have plunged under Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Beijing started ramping up diplomatic, military and economic pressure after the 2016 election of Tsai Ing-wen who regards Taiwan as an already sovereign nation and not part of “one China”.
But Beijing’s sabre-rattling has reached new heights in the past 18 months with Chinese fighter jets and bombers now routinely flying into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone.
US pressure 
A firebrand Marxist in his youth, Ortega ruled Nicaragua from 1979 to 1990.
He previously changed recognition to China in 1985 but a successor switched it back five years later.
Returning to power in 2007, Ortega has won re-election four times, becoming increasingly dictatorial and quashing presidential term limits.
He had previously expressed hopes to establish ties with both China and Taiwan, a concept that Beijing would not condone. Sociologist and economist Oscar Rene Vargas said the switch could be motivated by an uptick in US pressure and sanctions on Ortega after his victory in a November vote that President Joe Biden described as a “pantomime election”.
Fearing isolation, Ortega was seeking “Chinese political support”, Vargas told AFP.
Taiwan’s remaining allies in Central America are Belize, Guatemala and Honduras. It has ties with a handful of other countries including Haiti and Paraguay.
Honduras looks like it could be the next ally to fall after leftist Xiomara Castro won election earlier this month.
Castro, who will take office in late January, has previously said she plans to make the switch to China.
Outside of Latin America and the Caribbean, Taiwan’s remaining diplomatic allies are limited to four small Pacific island nations, Eswatini in Africa and the Vatican.
However multiple powerful Western allies continue to maintain de facto diplomatic relations with Taipei and those relationships have strengthened in recent years as China’s threats of invasion have become more pronounced.
In recent months, there has been a flurry of diplomatic activity in Taipei with multiple delegations from the United States and several European nations visiting.
Taiwan’s digital minister and its envoy to Washington are currently attending Biden’s “Democracy Summit” — an invitation that infuriated Beijing.

8,Palestinian killed by Israeli troops in West Bank,The man sustained a gunshot wound to the head during clashes with Israeli forces in Beita.,"RAMALLAH: A Palestinian was killed by Israeli troops during a clash in the occupied West Bank on Friday, the Palestinian health ministry said.  
The man sustained a gunshot wound to the head during clashes with Israeli forces in the northern village of Beita and succumbed to his injuries at a hospital in Nablus, the ministry said in a statement.
Beita is the scene of regular demonstrations against Jewish settlement expansion, with residents demonstrating since May against the wildcat settlement outpost of Eviatar set up nearby without Israeli permission.
The Israeli army said it was “aware” of reports of the death of a Palestinian, adding that a “violent riot was instigated in the area of the Givat Eviatar outpost, south of Nablus”.
“During the riot, hundreds of Palestinians hurled burning tyres and rocks at Israel Defence Force and Israeli Border Police troops, who responded with riot dispersal means to restore order,” a statement from the military said.

The announcement came despite Johnson specifically saying on Wednesday he hoped people would go ahead with Christmas parties and other festive events such as children’s Nativity plays, while exercising caution.
People in England will be asked to follow guidance to work from home if possible from Monday, prompting many offices to cancel festive events such as parties, in a severe blow to the hospitality industry.

11,Drugmakers singling out US for inflation-busting price hikes: probe,WASHINGTON: The pharmaceutical industry is targeting vulnerable Americans with predatory pricing that is forcing ...,"WASHINGTON: The pharmaceutical industry is targeting vulnerable Americans with predatory pricing that is forcing them to ration life-saving drugs, according to a three-year congressional probe released on Friday.
Investigators focused on 10 drugmakers they accuse of raising prices of common brand-name drugs by nearly four times the rate of inflation over the past five years.
“The committee’s investigation has pulled back the curtain on drug companies’ unfair, unjustified, always increasing drug prices,” congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, who led the probe, said at a press conference.
Drug pricing has vexed politicians for years in the United States, which has the highest annual health expenditure of any industrialised country, at around $11,000 per capita, with pharmaceuticals playing a major role.
The 269-page report by the House Oversight Committee’s majority Democrats offers what Maloney described as a  “rare glimpse” into the tactics of the world’s most profitable drugmakers.
For 12 medications the committee examined, the manufacturers raised prices more than 250 times in the five years from 2016, it said _ as their chief executives pocketed salaries totalling $800 million.
Mindy Salango, a diabetic and patient advocate from Morgantown, West Virginia, said she had been reduced to arranging clandestine meetings to give patients otherwise unaffordable insulin.
“We’re not criminals, and we’re meeting in parking lots like we’re criminals. This isn’t health care. This is survival of the richest,” the campaigner, who pays $350 a month for her insulin, told reporters.
Salango said studies had shown that a quarter of US diabetics normally ration their insulin due to unaffordable prices _ but the figure increased to an alarming half of patients during the pandemic.
‘Record profits’ 
“They have made record profits at the expense of the lives of diabetics and other folks who have chronic illnesses that need their life-saving medication to survive,” she said.
Investigators said the probe “confirms that the pharmaceutical industry has targeted the United States for price increases for many years while maintaining or cutting prices in the rest of the world”. 
Spotlighting Pfizer’s Lyrica painkiller, which costs four times what it did in 2004, the report accused drug firms of “product hopping”, or tweaking drugs, to get a new patent and then switching patients to the newer, more expensive version.
The report rejects drugmakers’ position that the price hikes support development, saying they had used a significant portion of research funding to extend market monopolies and “suppress competition”.
