0,‘No hesitation’ in coming to Pakistan for West Indies coach Simmons,"Admits however that there is a lot more security, says “we can’t go out and see what Karachi is like.”","KARACHI: Phil Simmons had no hesitation in coming to Pakistan. In fact, he’s happy to be here. 
The same goes for the players who have arrived in the country for the white-ball tour starting next week, the West Indies coach said. 
But this is a West Indies team missing several of its top players. Jason Holder was rested while four others, including Simmons’ own nephew Lendl Simmons, Andre Russell, Shimron Het­meyer and Evin Lewis, opted out due to personal reasons. 
Both Lendl Simmons and Russell have been part of the Pakistan Super League, but have never featured in a match of the Twenty20 tournament when it has been played in Pakistan. 
In 2016, Russell had said in an interview he’d be ‘scared’ but willing to travel to Pakistan. 
That was never a concern for the former West Indies all-rounder Simmons even though his team is the first to tour Pakistan since New Zealand abandoned their tour and England cancelled theirs earlier this year due to “security” and “mental health” issues. 
“There wasn’t any hesitation,” Simmons told a virtual news conference on Friday, three days before the start of the T20 International series which will be followed by the One-day International series with all the matches being played in Karachi. 
“Once we got the clear from the security [consultants], we had a call with the players and we are happy to come.” 
He, however, admitted the situation — also in part due to the Covid-19 pandemic — is different from when he toured with the West Indies as a player back in 1997. 
“There is a lot of security … very different from when I toured Pakistan last time,” he said. “We can’t go out and see what Karachi is like.”
The T20s against Pakistan will mark the first competitive action for the West Indies since they relinquished their Twenty20 World Cup title without a whimper in the UAE. They were then in Sri Lanka for a two-Test series where they were swept aside by the hosts.
Simmons admitted this was a rebuilding phase for his side, about trying new players, a process of evolution. And he was wary of Twenty20 World Cup semi-finalists Pakistan who head into the series buoyed by a 3-0 T20 series sweep in Bangladesh, which preceded a 2-0 Test series sweep.
“Playing Pakistan in Pakistan is pressure,” he said, adding that the T20 series will help West Indies in building their side for next year’s Twenty20 World Cup in Australia. 
“We will see who puts up their hands to be a major player. We have an idea what they can deliver but we want to see how they fare in matches like these, against a side like Pakistan. We need to transform what we’re doing off the pitch, onto the pitch. We want to see how we evolve.” 
Simmons said his side had a plan in mind for Pakistan pacer Shaheen Shah Afridi, who has a knack of ripping through the oppositions’ top-order. 
“Shaheen has been brilliant for Pakistan,” he said, “but we have a plan for him and we’ll see how it goes.”

1,‘Kohli lost ODI captaincy as India wanted one white-ball skipper’,NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli’s decision to relinquish the 20-overs captaincy resulted in him being removed as India’s...,"NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli’s decision to relinquish the 20-overs captaincy resulted in him being removed as India’s ODI skipper as selectors did not want to have two different white-ball captains, India board (BCCI) chief Saurav Ganguly said.
Opener Rohit Sharma took over as India’s one-day captain on Wednesday, a month after succeeding Kohli as T20 skipper following their disappointing T20 World Cup campaign in the UAE during October-November.
The BCCI, which rarely explains even routine decisions, did not even mention Kohli by name in conveying the leadership change in a single sentence at the bottom of a press release announcing the test squad for the upcoming tour of South Africa.
“The BCCI and selectors had asked Virat to rethink his decision to quit T20 captaincy. He had declined the suggestion at the time,” former captain Ganguly told Friday’s Times of India newspaper.
“The selectors were uncomfortable with the idea of having two captains for white-ball cricket.”
India reached the semi-finals of the 50-overs World Cup in 2019 under Kohli but exited from the group stage at this year’s T20 World Cup.
While happy to play under Rohit in the T20 World Cup in Australia next year, Kohli, who remains the Test captain, was keen to lead India in the 50-overs showpiece on home soil in 2023.
“He has done well even as an ODI captain. But it was not going to be easy to have two captains in white-ball cricket with two World Cups in two years,” Ganguly said.
“The selectors felt the team needed one vision and varied styles of captaincy could disrupt the planning.”
Ganguly said he and chief selector Chetan Sharma spoke to Kohli before making the change.
“We explained the vision to him. He understood the situation and it was only then that Rohit was named the captain of the ODI team.”

The tournament begins in Dhaka from Tuesday with Pakistan taking on Japan and the online visas would only be received by Sunday, with the weekly holiday in Bangladesh falling on Friday and Saturday.
Goalkeepers Amjad Ali and Mazhar Abbas as well as goalkeeping coach Ahmed Alam, trainer Abid Amin and physio Mohammad Aslam couldn’t join the rest of the team, which left for Bangladesh from Karachi on Friday.
Amjad and Mazhar were named as replacements to Abdullah and Waqar Ahmed, who were originally announced in the squad before being dropped due to sluggish performances at the recent FIH Junior World Cup in India.
Abdullah and Waqar, however, did receive their visas and are travelling with the squad to Bangladesh in case there is a delay in the issuance of visas for Amjad and Mazhar. Ahmad was also appointed only recently to the team management.
The PHF is still hoping to get the visas by Sunday and is willing to send Amjad and Mazhar at the earliest. In that case both Waqar and Abdullah will remain in Bangladesh as reserves.
More surprisingly, umpire Haroon Rasheed and judge Hasan Akhtar are also awaiting visas. It is the responsibility of the Asian Hockey Federation  to ensure the visas of its own officials well on time.
“The PHF is in contact with both the Bangladesh’s authorities and the AHF and hopefully more online visas will be issued from Bangladesh by Sunday,” PHF secretary Asif Bajwa said.

Arnaut Danjuma’s double helped Villarreal win 3-2 away to Atalanta in a game postponed from Wednesday because of heavy snowfall in northern Italy. 
The Spanish side only needed a draw to advance as runners-up from Group ‘F’ but jumped out to a 3-0 lead by the 51st minute.  
Dutch international Danjuma put Atalanta ahead inside three minutes and Etienne Capoue doubled the lead shortly before half-time on another chilly evening in Bergamo. 
Danjuma scored again early in the second half but Villarreal were forced to hold on as Atalanta responded with goals from Ruslan Malinovskyi and Duvan Zapata while hitting the woodwork three times. 
“We started very badly and in these games it becomes difficult when you go behind so early,” Atalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini told Amazon. “The players put in a lot of good performances, but we missed a little bit tonight. When we managed to improve the game was gone.” 
Atalanta finished third in the group and will enter a playoff to get into the last 16 of the second-tier Europa League, the competition Villarreal won last season. 
Leicester faced a must-win game at Napoli to advance in the Europa League but lost 3-2. Spartak Moscow secured top spot of Group ‘C’ with a 1-0 away victory at Legia Warsaw. 
Also, Eintracht Frankfurt, Galatasaray and Red Star Belgrade made the next round while Bayer Leverkusen, Olympique Lyonnais, Monaco and West Ham United had already qualified with a game to spare. 
Only the eight group winners go straight into the round of 16 the runners-up enter a playoff with the eight teams who finish in third place in the Champions League groups. 
In the inaugural Europa Conference League, Jose Mourinho’s AS Roma reached the next round after a 3-2 win at CSKA Sofia and Basel was the last to reach the round of 16. 
Another big team in the competition, Tottenham Hotspur, had their game against Stade Rennais postponed after a coronavirus outbreak at the English club that would have deprived manager Antonio Conte of at least eight players who have tested positive. A new date for the match has not been announced. 
AZ Alkmaar, FC Copenhagen, Feyenoord, Gent, LASK Linz, and Rennes had already won their groups in the third-tier competition. 
The draw for the next stage is scheduled for Monday. 
In the tightly contested Europa League Group ‘C’, all four teams were in contention for the round of 16 ahead of the final round. 
Leicester were top of the group going into the final round of matches, but the defeat in Naples dropped them to third place, meaning they will enter the Conference League in the knockout play-off round in February. 
“I’ve got to be honest I don’t even know what the competition is,” Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers said of UEFA’s third-tier tournament. 
“I was focused on the Europa League and winning this group or at the very least finishing second. I’m not sure what it is, but I’m sure we will find out soon enough.” 
Leicester had a disastrous start at Napoli. Forward Adam Ounas gave Napoli early lead four minutes into the game with a low shot. Twenty minutes later, Eljif Elmas doubled the advantage. 
Leicester pulled one back three minutes later when defender Jonny Evans found himself at the right spot in the area to reduce the lead and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall equalised in the 33rd after a rebound. 
But Napoli recovered with Elmas scoring again in the second half. 
A 1-1 away draw against Fenerbahe was enough for Eintracht Frankfurt to claim Group ‘D’. Olympiakos finished second after a 1-0 loss to hosts Royal Antwerp. 
Galatasaray held Lazio to a 0-0 draw in Rome to advance from Group ‘E’, leaving their Italian opponents in second. 
Red Star, the 1991 European Cup winners, clinched Group ‘F’ with a 1-1 draw at Portugal’s Braga who finished second at the expense of third-placed Midtjylland who could only manage a 0-0 stalemate at Ludogorets. 
Lyon’s perfect record in Group ‘A’ ended with a 1-1 draw against Rangers. Rangers finished second in the group, with Sparta Prague third after a 2-0 win over Brondby. 
Real Sociedad also booked a playoff berth as they finished runners-up in Group ‘B’ thanks to a 3-0 home win over PSV Eindhoven which took the Spanish side above the 1988 European Cup winners. 
West Ham recorded their first loss of the group stage, 1-0 to Dinamo Zagreb who finished second in Group ‘H’. 
In the Europa Conference League, Tottenham’s postponed match against Rennes looms large over Group ‘G’. 
Second-placed Vitesse Arnhem beat Mura 3-1 to move three points clear of Tottenham, who now know they must beat group winners Rennes when the game is eventually rearranged if they are to qualify for the knockout stages. 
Tammy Abraham scored twice for Roma at Sofia that gave them top spot in Group ‘C’ after second-placed Bodo/Glimt were held to a 1-1 draw by Zorya Luhansk. 
Arthur Cabral scored twice for FC Basel in a 3-0 victory against Qaraba to advance as winners in Group ‘H’. 
Denmark’s Randers placed second in Group ‘D’ despite a 1-0 loss to Alkmaar while a 1-1 home draw against Anorthosis Famagusta secured second place in Group ‘B’ for Partizan Belgrade.

5,"Malan, record-breaking Root, lead England’s fightback in Brisbane",BRISBANE: Joe Root and Dawid Malan put on a defiant unbeaten partnership of 159 to give England hope of salvaging a...,"BRISBANE: Joe Root and Dawid Malan put on a defiant unbeaten partnership of 159 to give England hope of salvaging a draw in the opening Ashes Test here at the Gabba on Friday.
A rejuvenated England were 220-2 at the close of play, with skipper Root on 86 and Malan 80, only 58 runs behind Australia.
After England lost both openers in the session before tea, Root and Malan looked increasingly comfortable on the third-day Gabba pitch as they steadily wore down the Australian attack.
Root’s classy 86 not out off 158 balls is one short of his highest score in Australia and took him past 1,500 runs in a calendar year, the most ever by an Englishman, surpassing Michael Vaughan’s 1,481 in 2002. Former Pakistan batter Mohammad Yousuf holds the world record with his 1,788 runs in 11 Tests during the year 2006.
Leading by example, the skipper barely offered a chance in his innings, stroking 10 boundaries including a sublime reverse sweep off spinner Nathan Lyon.
After England’s dismal start to the Ashes, when they were bowled out for just 147 in their first innings, it was just what they needed.
“For him [Root] to carry on the form he had in our summer and the early English winter is fantastic and it’s great signs for us as a team that Joe’s playing well out here, and is leading from the front,” Malan said.
Lyon, still searching for his 400th Test wicket, never looked like breaking through.
The South African-born Malan, who overall faced 177 deliveries, scored his only Test century on the last tour of Australia and although not as comfortable as his captain, he also looked in control. He did struggle with fatigue towards the close, however, and went down with cramp.
Earlier, Travis Head scored a superb 152 to put Australia in what seemed a commanding position after their first innings.


ENGLAND batter Dawid Malan plays a shot.—AFP

 
Australia were finally dismissed for 425 on Friday, 30 minutes before lunch, a handsome lead of 278.
England then survived a tricky period and went to lunch 23 for no wicket.
Rory Burns, who was out first ball of the series on Wednesday when clean-bowled by Mitchell Starc, was lucky to survive the dreaded pair when he was adjudged leg-before wicket on Starc’s sixth ball of the first over of the day.
But after reviewing the decision, replays showed the ball was just missing the top of middle stump, and a relieved Burns survived.
But he didn’t last long after lunch and gloved a ball to wicket-keeper Alex Carey off Australian captain Pat Cummins.
Haseeb Hameed looked in great touch and eased to 27, but he tried to glance a wide ball from Starc, only to get a faint touch to Carey.
Malan knows that plenty more work lies ahead despite England’s improved showing.
“To come here today and do what we did after a day and half of hard fielding is fantastic, but that’s only half the job.” he said.
“We need another 250-300 runs tomorrow to put ourselves in a good position.”
Australian batsman Marnus Labuschagne said that the hosts needed to hold their nerve.
“Test cricket is a grind, it’s meant to be hard otherwise it wouldn’t mean so much,” he said. “For us it’s a day at the office. We’ll review our plans and how we bowled today, and come up with some ideas and get those last eight wickets.” 
Head, controversially selected for the Test ahead of Usman Khawaja, played a magnificent hand.
After blasting the third-fastest century in Ashes history in the final session on Thursday, Head carried on where he left off on Friday morning, flashing at anything wide and attacking English spinner Jack Leach anew.
Head played and missed a number of times, but was rewarded for his stroke play, his 152 coming from only 148 balls including four massive sixes and 14 boundaries.
Head brought up his 150 with a pull shot through square leg off Leach, whose Test future must surely be in doubt after going for 102 runs in his 13 overs.
England didn’t help their cause with three dropped catches in the session.
Chris Woakes put down a caught-and-bowled chance, wicket-keeper Jos Buttler couldn’t handle a tough caught behind off Mark Wood and Hameed grassed a chance in the deep, also off Wood’s bowling.
Wood was rewarded for his consistent high pace, taking 3-85, including the wicket of Head, while Ollie Robinson was the most dangerous of the English bowlers with 3-58.

Barty hasn’t played since a shock third-round loss at the US Open in September, but the Australian still finished 2021 as world number one after a season in which she won five titles.
The reigning Wimbledon champion headlines an Adelaide International field that boasts nine of the world’s top 10 women, including Iga Swiatek, who will be defending her title.
Former world number ones Garbine Muguruza, Karolina Pliskova and Victoria Azarenka are also entered for the Jan 2-9 event, along with world number two Aryna Sabalenka.
The only top 10 player missing in Adelaide will be seventh-ranked Estonian Anett Kontaveit.
Defending Australian Open champion Osaka, who has slipped to 13 in the world, will play at the Melbourne Summer Set event from Jan 3-9, which features simultaneous women’s and men’s tournaments. She will be joined by US Open champion Emma Raducanu.
Others on the Melbourne bill include Simona Halep, Elise Mertens and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, the top-ranked player at 11.
US great Serena Williams has pulled out of the Australian summer, saying she was not  “where I need to be physically”.
Most of the leading men are scheduled to start 2022 at the ATP Cup in Sydney from Jan 1, including Novak Djokovic, Daniil Medvedev and Alexander Zverev.
But Spanish superstar Nadal opted to skip it and will instead have a lower-key preparation in Melbourne at a tournament also featuring former world number three Grigor Dimitrov.
Nadal plans to make his tennis return at an Abu Dhabi exhibition later this month before travelling to Australia, where all players are expected to be fully vaccinated against coronavirus.

8,First blood to Hamilton in Abu Dhabi GP,"Verstappen, who won at the circuit last year to end six years of domination by Mercedes, was placed fourth.","ABU DHABI: Lewis Hamilton’s quest to make Formula One history at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix began brightly with the Mercedes driver topping the timesheets after Friday’s opening practice.
Hamilton, chasing an unprecedented eighth world title, goes into Sunday’s season-closing race level on points with Max Verstappen.
And it was the Dutch title contender who was quickest out of the blocks at the Yas Marina circuit, taking the honours in the morning session.
Hamilton, placed third, turned the tables under floodlights in second practice with a 1min 23.691 lap to get his weekend off to an encouraging start.
“It doesn’t feel too bad,” said the 36-year-old Briton. “It started off good but got a bit worse in P1, then started off better in the second session with some changes we made.
“Now we just have to crank through the data and try to figure out how we can improve, where we home in. The target is always moving, but yes. Otherwise, I feel good.”
Alpine’s Esteban Ocon led the chasing pack, 0.343sec adrift, followed by Valtteri Bottas on his last run out for Mercedes before moving to Alfa Romeo in 2022.
Verstappen, who won at the circuit last year to end six years of domination by Mercedes, was placed fourth, at 0.641sec.
The Abu Dhabi track has undergone a major revamp since last year to improve overtaking opportunities, and on the evidence of opening practice it appears to suit Mercedes better than Red Bull.
“We’re still learning and understanding a few things,” reported the 24-year-old Verstappen.
Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said the boffins will be hard at work trying to find more speed to make up the difference in pace with Mercedes.
“We’ve still got 24 hours or 23 hours (before qualifying) to try and find a better set-up and a bit more pace.”
Hamilton approaches Sunday’s closing chapter of a 2021 season that will live long in the memory on a four-timer after wins in Brazil, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.
His late season surge sees the pair neck and neck at the top of the drivers’ standings — the last time that happened was in 1974.
The maths are simple — whoever finishes with more points takes the title.
But Verstappen will prevail should they both end up all square — (one finishes 9th, the other 10th with fastest lap) or fail to score any on the strength of winning nine races to Hamilton’s eight.Friday’s action was red-flagged at the end when Kimi Raikkonen, who is retiring after this weekend, crashed at turn 14.
The 2007 world champion emerged unscathed from his smashed up Alfa Romeo.
