0,Rawalpindi to be divided into three tehsils: minister,"Says creation of city, cantonment and Saddar tehsils to ensure provision of facilities to residents at doorsteps.","RAWALPINDI: Punjab Law Minister Mohammad Basharat Raja on Friday announced that the government had decided to divide Rawalpindi into three tehsils — city, cantonment and Saddar.
Addressing a public meeting in Dhamial, the minister said the PTI-led Punjab government wanted to provide maximum facilities to the people of the garrison city and for this purpose it had decided to divide Rawalpindi subdivision into three parts aimed at better administration. The citizens would get basic civic facilities at their doorsteps, he added.
It may be mentioned here that Rawalpindi district comprises seven tehsils - Rawalpindi, Gujar Khan, Taxila, Murree, Kahuta, Kallar Syedan and Kotli Sattian.
During the tenure of military ruler Pervez Musharraf in 2001, the city was divided into Potohar and Rawal towns. 
However, in 2013, the PML-N government discontinued the two-town system and gave a special status to Murree, making it a municipal corporation.

Says creation of city, cantonment and Saddar tehsils to ensure provision of facilities to residents at doorsteps; projects worth Rs850m inaugurated

Meanwhile, speaking at the public meeting, the provincial minister said in the last three years the Punjab government had launched Rs130 billion worth of development projects to improve infrastructure and civic facilities in Rawalpindi.
“Public service is our politics. Difficult times have passed and now people will see the trickle-down effects of the tough economic decisions,” he said.
Basharat Raja said Prime Minister Imran Khan and Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar were fighting the corruption mafia.
“Now the corruption mafia and the opposition parties are trying to hide their failures by holding rallies against inflation and price hikes,” he added.
The minister said he launched various development projects for the people of his constituency and got them completed.
The PTI government has always given importance to serving the people and protecting their interests and did not hide anything from them. 
It conducted politics in a dignified manner and on the basis of truth and honesty, he said, adding that his political office and residence, Dhamial House, was a symbol of service politics and its doors were open to the people 24 hours a day.
The provincial minister said development schemes had been launched so that residents would get all the basic facilities without any difficulty.
Mr Raja also inaugurated several projects costing over Rs850 million on the occasion.
These include construction of a road from Biscuit Factory Chowk to Lane 15 costing Rs50 million, rehabilitation of road from Harley Street to Qasim Base as well as footpaths, construction of two roads from Dhamial Mor to Lane No 5, construction of streets and laying of sewerage system in Ward No 6, streets and sewerage system in Ahmadabad, construction of streets at Quaid-i-Azam Colony and a water filtration plant in Ghaziabad.

Akram sacrificed his life last year on March 11 during rehearsal of the Pakistan Day parade in an F-16 aircraft. A monument will also be constructed at the site to honour him.
An officer of the Senate said during a Senate sitting last month, a resolution was passed in recognition of services of the martyred wing commander.

The said resolution was unanimously moved by Senator Saleem Mandviwalla on his own behalf and on behalf of over a dozen senators. The officer said that the Senate Secretariat sent the resolution to Ministry of Interior and Capital Development Authority (CDA) for further action on it.
Sources said the said proposal will be placed before the CDA board for final approval. The Pakistan Air Force (PAF) or CDA will construct a monument at the site.
They added that although the CDA board would take the final decision, there is no need to remove the chand tara and the monument could be constructed near the chowk. However, if the need arises, it will be removed. After approval of the summary from board, the CDA will hold a meeting with PAF for design of the site, they added.
An officer of the CDA said the pilot did not eject to save his life and till the last moment, he continued attempting to pull out the jet and lost his jet and life in the process. If the pilot had ejected, the plane could have crashed in the city area, but he sacrificed his life and saved the lives of others. Besides construction of the monument, a model of the jet should also be displayed at the site.
The chowk is located on Garden Avenue near Aabpara in front of the Pak China Centre.

In a bid to enhance the registration of transgender persons and create awareness, Nadra has launched countrywide campaign “Trans-Rights are Human Rights”. 
In this regard the authority is giving training to field officers/officials on Dec 13 to sensitise them to the right of transgender persons which would ultimately help them register them.
Nadra has so far registered 5,626 transgender persons who opted for a gender other than male or female. The authority further aims at creating awareness about the significance of legal identity for empowering the transgender community.
In this milieu, Nadra has engaged Ministry of Human Rights, Provincial/District Social Welfare Departments to mobilise the transgender persons for CNIC registration in order to help them eliminate long-standing discrimination, exclusion and sporadic violence.
Nadra Chairman Tariq Malik held meeting with transgender persons hailing from different parts of the country. 
During the meeting he said this year on the occasion of International Human Rights Day we are asserting that trans-rights are also human rights.
Achieving meaningful progress on SDG 16.9 & 10.2 towards sustainable human development, we must promote and protect the rights of the most vulnerable segments of the society and take measures for creating an inclusive society with effective participation of transgender persons, he added.
He said Nadra has taken this daunting task of bringing the transgender persons in the fold of inclusive society by issuing them the basic identity document i.e CNIC. My message is clear to all genders, “Be yourself, we will adjust. To be perceived as what you say is your basic right.” said Tariq Malik.
In this regard, special Mobile Registration Vans (MRVs) are being deployed on Dec 10 for registration of transgender persons in coordination with ministry of human rights and

In October, the CDA board had decided that the club building will be used as a convention and culture centre. Sources in the CDA said that after the board decision the CDA moved the summary for a final approval from the federal cabinet.
A few months ago, Prime Minister Imran Khan visited the building which has been lying unused since its construction and asked CDA Chairman Amer Ali Ahmed and architect Nayyar Ali Dada to propose a viable utility plan for it. The building spreads over 22 acres with a 265,000 square feet covered area.
The building has facilities such as restaurants, an indoor pool, gym, lobby, aerobic area and a fitness centre.

Once approved by federal cabinet, citizens will use facilities on premises without membership, says official

The project was started by the CDA in 2008 and when the structure was completed the Supreme Court in 2010 took notice and ruled that the building cannot be used as a club.
Sources said the CDA approved rules for the centre and decided that a board of governors will manage it. It was also decided that people would have access to the facilities in the building and there will be no mandatory membership.
It was also decided that the centre may be used for holding conventions, exhibitions and provision of sports facilities, including a gym.
Currently, a Covid-19 mass vaccination centre is operating in the building.
The sources said the vaccination centre will be shifted to the adjacent building of the environment wing whose offices were to be shifted to the Art and Craft Village in Shakarparian.
A senior officer of the CDA confirmed that a summary had been moved to the interior ministry which is the line ministry for the CDA for onward submission to the cabinet.
He said the facility will be operated by a board of governors to be appointed by the federal government.
“After approval, we will take steps to open the door of the facility to public. The residents will have a new place for entertainment and learning,” he said.
The officer said on the directive of the prime minister, the committee had proposed using the building as a convention and culture centre and for other facilities for public. Subsequently, CDA board also approved the recommendations of the committee and is now soliciting approval of the cabinet, he said.

6,‘Pakistan not to disturb strategic stability in region’,ISLAMABAD: Former Director General Strategic Plans Division retired Lt-Gen Khalid Ahmed Kidwai has said that ...,"ISLAMABAD: Former Director General Strategic Plans Division retired Lt-Gen Khalid Ahmed Kidwai has said that Pakistan will ensure that strategic stability in the region is not disturbed.
Gen Kidwai was speaking at a conference organised by Centre for International Strategic Studies (CISS) on, ‘Strategic Stability and Nuclear Security: Global and Regional Perspectives’, according to a press release issued by the think tank.
In his keynote address, Gen Kidwai highlighted that in the strategic stability-instability paradigm of South Asia, it has become Pakistan’s responsibility to ensure that strategic stability will not be disturbed at any stage, despite India’s consistent efforts to swing the pendulum towards instability.
Being a responsible nuclear weapon State, Pakistan will not let destabilising inductions and doctrines to create instability.
Mr Kidwai raised the possibility of yet another false flag operation by India as a signature electoral strategy prior to the upcoming State Elections in Feb 2022 in five States, including the critical States of Uttar Pradesh and East Punjab.
He cautioned India not to consider Pakistan’s robust nuclear capability as a bluff. He stated, “If an irresponsible military adventure were to be undertaken by India again, Pakistan will respond forcefully under its retaliatory doctrine of ‘Quid Pro Quo Plus’, as it did successfully the very next day of Balakot on February 27, 2019.”
In deliberations on “global strategic stability and its implications for South Asia”, it was pointed out that the great power competition is giving impetus to development and modernization of weapon systems that are undermining the basic pillars of strategic stability. The so-called Indo-Pacific strategy is giving rise to regional insecurities and threatening the deterrent relationship between the regional players.
Regarding “Regional Security Dynamics of South Asia: Opportunities and Challenges,” the speakers were of the views that the region faces security challenges owing to increasing military asymmetries, fueled by global power competition. Concerns were raised about the environment of unresolved disputes like Kashmir and absence of dispute resolution mechanisms.
Projecting Hindustan as net security provider and foundational agreements like Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement only give New Delhi room for strategic manoeuvring and military advantage over other States at the cost of legitimate security concerns of others.

According to a notification issued by party’s central secretary general Ahsan Iqbal, the organising committee is headed by Shah Ghulam Qadir, former regional secretary general, and includes former regional president Raja Farooq Haider as one of the 14 members.
The remaining members are Chaudhry Tariq Farooq from Bhimber, Chaudhry Mohammad Saeed from Mirpur, Raja Naseer Ahmed Khan and Zulfiqar Ali Malik from Kotli, Raja Mushtaq Minhas from Bagh, Chaudhry Mohammad Aziz from Haveli, Sardar Abdul Khaliq Wasi from Poonch, Dr Najeeb Naqi from Sudhnoti, Noreen Arif and Barrister Iftikhar Ali Gillani from Muzaffarabad, Dr Mustafa Bashir from Jhelum Valley, Raja Mohammad Siddique and Syed Shaukat Shah from Kashmiri refugees based in Pakistan.
Except for Mr Malik and Mr Wasi, the rest were part of the cabinet in the previous PML-N government. Of these 15 members, only Mr Qadir and Mr Haider have returned in the July 2021 elections from Neelum and Jhelum valleys, respectively.
The notification declared that all wings of the party as well as its organisational set-up in Pakistan and overseas would also stand dissolved.
It said the reorganisation and election for new office-bearers would be held on the basis of divisions, districts, electoral constituencies, union councils, wards and polling stations in consultation with the members of the organising committee within two months.
The PML-N was launched in AJK in December 2010 with Mr Haider and Mr Qadir as its chief organiser and secretary organising committee. At the first convention in Mirpur in April 2012, Mr Haider, Mr Farooq and Mr Qadir were elected unopposed president, senior vice president and secretary general. However, afterwards the party could not hold a second convention.
The differences in the PML-N AJK chapter came into the open late last month after Mr Qadir, Mr Tariq Farooq and Mr Minhas overturned the nominations of some United States-based PML-N workers for overseas party offices by Mr Haider during his private USA tour, saying the move was not only “in contravention of a consensus on re-organisation but had also caused irreparable damage to the party’s goodwill.”
When contacted, Mr Qadir said the reorganisation and fresh election of office-bearers was a unanimous demand of all party workers.
“We will accomplish this task within the stipulated period by taking every worker on board,” he added.

11,"Noor Mukadam’s works, life honoured",Her father recalled fond memories of his daughter and her spiritual and artistic inclinations.,"ISLAMABAD: Emotional speeches marked the inauguration of an exhibition honouring the works and life of the late Noor Mukadam at Pakistan National Council of the Arts (PNCA). 
A large number of people including Noor’s friends, members of the diplomatic community, and art connoisseurs, civil society and women rights activists attended the event.
The exhibition titled, Noor – honouring the life and works of Noor Mukadam has been curated by Syed Jamal Shah, a noted artist, director, playwright and former director general of PNCA.
The exhibit showcases Noor’s calligraphic work and paintings. Exhibited pieces included: Al-Hamd (Praise be to God), Loh-e-Quran, Grace, Japanese garden and Freedom. 



 
The painting of a puppy that Noor had made in 2016 with the message, “it is inhumane to kill dogs. Treat Dogs” was the main attraction. Commenting on the painting, artist and activist Fauzia Minallah said: “The painting of the puppy was my favourite. I could not hold back my tears. There is so much innocence in the puppy’s eyes. I have never met Noor or her family but her work shows what an innocent and loving woman she was”.
Rabia Amin was the host of the event. Noor’s notebook, pen and colours, palette and brushes were also displayed.
A minute of silence was observed for Noor, who was brutally murdered on July 20, 2021.
Mr Jamal Shah spoke about the spirit and essence of the exhibition and how an artist depicts his or her feelings and observation of society, the beauty and colours of the land, joys and societal ethos.



 
Our foremost objective is to showcase Noor’s expression of grace and humility through her art, he said.
Talking to Dawn, he said, “Noor’s work is very sensitive, sincere, and spontaneous. Her work is reflective of a being that is mindful of others, concerned about her surroundings and willing to offer her best in any situation with utmost generosity.
“The unassuming poise of exhibits will urge the onlookers to take a careful tour of the exhibition and find themselves engaged in a dialogue with Noor and reveal facets of her as an individual who had all the potential of becoming a consequential talent”.
Shaukat Ali Mukadam, Noor’s father said that the show coincided with conclusion of the 16-Days of Activism on Violence Against Women campaign.
He recalled fond memories of his daughter and her spiritual and artistic inclinations. “Her untimely death has fanned the flames of resistance and revolution for women of Pakistan as they continue to fight against gender-based violence. Her story has touched countless citizens”, he said while holding back his tears.
Mr Mukadam thanked Noor’s friends, civil society and media for their continued support in the race to get justice for Noor.
Motivational speaker Muniba Mazari said that psychological, sexual and emotional violence against women in any form and manifestation in the name of religion, culture and honour could not be justified and should be condemned. She recited Still I Rise by Maya Angelou, dedicated to Noor.
Noted human rights defender Tahira Abdullah said it was heartening to see that Noor’s parents have kept the spirit of hope alive.
“This exhibition gives the spirit of hope to all of us to fight against injustices and violence against women. The inspiration of hope is embedded in this exhibition”, she added.
