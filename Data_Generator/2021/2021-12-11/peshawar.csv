Saeed Zada of Jamaat-i-Islami, Sohail Ahmad of Awami National Party, Mohammad Sohail Yousafzai of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, Mohammad Rahim of JUI-F, Aamir Saeed of PML-N, Mohammad Nawaz Khan of Pakistan Peoples Party and independent Mohammad Raziq are in the run for the slot.
However, the real contest is likely between JUI-F’s Mohammad Rahim and PML-N’s Aamir Saeed.
It is to mention here that Mr Saeed has already contested election twice from a provincial assembly constituency, but each time he finished as runner-up. In general elections 2013, his brother Mohammad Shiraz was elected as MPA.
Political analysts said PML-N had a chance to clinch the seat as the party had about 5,000 votes in the mountainous Gadoon Amazai region.
To boost his position, Mr Saeed is required to take a big lead from his native Topi city, which will be a challenging task for him, they believe.
The political pundits said JUI-F’s Mr Rahim, who belongs to Gandaf, a union council in Gadoon Amazai, was well-positioned to get a good number of votes from the mountainous belt despite the fact that he is contesting the local body elections for the first time as he enjoyed the support of former provincial minister Ghafoor Khan Jadoon.
They said PTI’s Sohail Yousafzai, who also remained a former Topi tehsil nazim, could also get a good number of votes with the support of National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser. 
Meanwhile, Saeed Zada of JI and Mohammed Nawaz of PPP claimed they were in strong position to win the seat.

Additional district and sessions judge Mohammad Ayaz Khan declared that the accused, Malik Tajamul Hayat, was not entitled to the concession of bail before arrest at the current stage.

An FIR was registered against the petitioner at the Tehkal police station on Nov 14, 2020, under Section 489-F (dishonestly issuing a cheque) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Complainant in the FIR was a resident of Police Colony, Peshawar, Syed Tahiruddin Shah, who alleged that a Rs5 million cheque issued to him by the petitioner on May 31, 2020, bounced due to ‘closed/inactive’ bank account.
The petitioner’s lawyer said his client was named in the case to damage his reputation and that of his educational institutions.
The counsel for the complainant said the petitioner had directly been charged with committing the offence and that, too, for huge amount, which had yet to be recovered from him.
He added that if the the petition for pre-arrest bail was cancelled and the accused was remanded in police custody, the amount would be recovered.
The lawyer said under the law, it was a crime if anyone dishonestly issued a cheque for the repayment of a loan or fulfilment of an obligation and that cheque bounced.
The court observed that from tentative assessment of the available records, as required at the pre-arrest bail stage, the accused had not been able to point out any mala fide on part of the complainant and prosecution.
It added that the grant of pre-arrest bail was an extraordinary concession, which could be granted in extraordinary circumstances and wherein it was on the record that there was no case against the accused.
The court observed that the points raised by the petitioner were related to the merit of the case, which could not be decided at the current stage of proceedings.
