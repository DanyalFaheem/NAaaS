Addressing the Friday congregations at mosques all over the country, religious scholars and clerics said blasphemy law existed in the country and in case of any complaint, court should be moved and that Sialkot tragedy brought disgrace to Islam and Pakistan.  
The religious leadership also appealed to the chief Justice of Pakistan to issue orders to expedite trials of blasphemy cases.  
They said the delay in proceedings of such cases raised concerns and doubts among the people and provide an excuse to the anti-Pakistan elements to fan nefarious propaganda.  
They said Ulemas and Mashaykh (religious scholars) from all over the country welcomed and supported the announcement by the prime minister and corps commander conference to punish the culprits of Sialkot incident.  
They said there was national consensus on condemning Sialkot tragedy, but some elements were targeting the blasphemy laws “to divide the nation.”  
Blasphemy law was a “source of protection of the human lives, peace and stability” in the country, they said. They agreed that it was not lawful for a person to take the law into his own hands when these laws existed.  
Meanwhile, after leading Juma prayers in the Grand Jamia Masjid Bahria Town, addressing a press conference Hafiz Tahir Mahmood Ashrafi said today religious scholars and leadership of all the religious schools of thought across the country had raised their unanimous voice against brutal incident of Sialkot.  
Mr Ashrafi also announced that an awareness campaign was also being launched in the country regarding the blasphemy laws. “Those who use the name of Islam and Namose-e- Mustafa (Peace Be Upon Him) for their own purposes are also criminals. The nation has to back the security institutions of the country, government and Pakistan Army for eradication of extremism as it had remained united to defeat the menace of terrorism in the country.”  
He also said that the declaration of Prime Minister Imran Khan and corps commander conference was an expression of the entire nation’s sentiments. The provincial government was dealing with the Sialkot tragedy in an efficient way, he added, saying the perpetrators would be brought to justice.  
He said the leadership of all the religions would make a very important announcement tomorrow (Saturday) regarding the Sialkot incident.  
Qureshi: Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said on Friday Pakistan was well aware of its responsibilities as an important regional stakeholder. 
He was addressing the Shah Rukn-i-Alam Conference on the 708th Urs celebrations of Hazrat Shah Rukn-i-Alam in Multan. 
Mr Qureshi said the Sialkot incident brought a bad name to Pakistan in the world and moderate and sensible people should condemn the incident. 
He also urged the religious scholars from different schools of thought to not only condemn the incident but also dissociate themselves from it.

Muhammad Ibrahim was appointed as a postman in 1987 and during his service he was assigned officiating postmaster at Qila Abdullah, Quetta district. He was alleged to have misappropriated public money belonging to the exchequer while making bogus payments in the Benazir Bhutto Income Support Programme (BISP). 
He was proceeded against on certain charges, resulting in registration of a criminal case against him and after departmental inquiry was dismissed from service in 2012. In the criminal case the postman was sentenced to two years in jail in 2014. 
However, the postman challenged his conviction before the Balochistan High Court and was acquitted in 2018. 
In the meantime, the postman served grievance notice on the divisional superintendent of Quetta post office and thereafter filed a grievance petition before a labour court of Quetta. 
The divisional superintendent did not join the proceedings and the petition was accepted.  
The postman was reinstated into service. 
The judgment of the Quetta labour court was also upheld by a labour appellate tribunal in 2014. 
The post office department filed a constitutional petition in the SC. 
A three-judge bench of the SC took up the petition and appointed senior lawyer Hafiz Tariq Nasim, an expert in service laws, as amicus curiae to assist it whether a postman was a civil servant or a workman. 
The lawyer told the bench that a postman did not fall within the definition of ‘civil servant’, rather in view of nature of his duties he fully qualifies to be considered as workman. 
He said Pakistan Post was a trans-provincial department having its offices in each province and also in the federal capital. Therefore, he said, the provisions of the National Industrial Relations Act 2012 would be applicable to the postman. 
The bench, in its judgment, also declared that postman was a workman and not a civil servant and he could agitate his grievance before the NIRC.

US Consulate General Lahore Political Officer Khatijah Corey, Shalamar Hospital Trust chairman Shahid Hussain and Dr Laurent from Johns Hopkins International attended the event. 
Ms Corey underscored US government’s support for women-centred healthcare stating, “Quality women-centred healthcare is difficult to find even today. From my own personal experience, these institutions offer safe and comfortable spaces where I feel my care is personalised and focused on some of the unique hurdles women face.” 
She said the US and Pakistan shared a long, mutually beneficial relationship in the health sector, built on government-to-government cooperation and people to people ties. She said Pakistani doctors in the US helped to ensure better health outcomes there and in turn the US healthcare system was providing access to high-quality training and information on best practices for Pakistani medical professionals, to the benefit of both countries. 
Ms Corey further said the agreement between Johns Hopkins and Shalamar represents another step along the long road toward women’s equal participation in society, a road the Biden administration has endeavoured to straighten and shorten to whatever extent possible. 
The US government, in conjunction with the US Agency for International Development (USAID), works with provincial and federal governments to ensure that Pakistan’s healthcare system can offer improved and cost-effective services to the people of Pakistan. 
Some of these programs include an initiative with the Pakistan Drug Testing and Research Centre and Labs to improve capacity and improve quality of medical products. 
USAID also works closely with the health system to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease in Pakistan. 
In the current Covid-19 pandemic, the US government has donated 27.6 million vaccine doses, more than $69.4 million in financial support, and an additional $9.2 million in in-kind support to Pakistan to combat Covid-19. 
This is the first MOU signed between any medical institute of Pakistan and Johns Hopkins International for the provision of advanced healthcare.

According to an FIR, SHO Muhammad Afzal with his team was patrolling near Acharwal village, when they spotted five gunmen by the roadside. They intercepted the police vehicle and when the SHO switched on the revolving light and told them to surrender, the gunmen took the cover of bushes in the graveyard and fired at the police.

15,Stakeholders pin hopes on PM’s intervention to save college land,"MIANWALI: Teachers, students and former students of the Government Postgraduate College of Mianwali say they hope...","MIANWALI: Teachers, students and former students of the Government Postgraduate College of Mianwali say they hope that Prime Minister Imran Khan’s visit to Mianwali on Saturday may help thwart a move by the Punjab Higher Education Department to transfer college’s 130 kanals to the adjacent University of Mianwali (UoM). 
The Mianwali chapter of the Punjab Professors and Lecturers Association (PPLA) at a meeting condemned the move and said the Mianwali Government College was the oldest educational institute of the district, which was established in 1950. That time, it spread over 330 kanals and 14 marlas. The college has post-graduate classes of English and Political Science subjects, which started in 1992, while BS classes began in 2020 in Chemistry, Physics, Botany, Zoology and English degrees. 
By and by, the college started losing its land.
First, in 2011, the sub-campus of the University of Sargodha (UoS) was carved out of the college’s land (80 kanals) and later in 2019, the UoS was converted into the UoM. Now, the UoM has grabbed another 130 kanals out of the remaining 250 kanals of the degree college under a letter by the Punjab Higher Education Department to the Colleges Director of the Sargodha division. 
The PPLA says the post-graduate college charges a student Rs6,000 per semester, whereas the UoM charges Rs26,000 per semester. It says the poor inhabitants of the district cannot afford costly education. It says that Mianwali, despite being the hometown of Prime Minister Imran Khan, is being neglected to provide state land outside the city to establish the UoM. 
PPLA Vice-President Prof Muhammad Hayat Khan told Dawn that they will agitate against the land transfer at all forums as they had the support of more than 2,500 college students and former students. He revealed that Chidroo village residents donated their 2,800 kanals for a cadet college but a rift among local politicians resulted in the shifting of the college to tehsil Isakhel. He claimed the villagers are willing to donate the same land for the UoM which will certainly make the future of their children bright.
Mohammad Jamal Khan, a spokesman for the college students, told Dawn that they were shocked to know about the land grab of their college, which included their sports grounds and lawns at the college. 
He said they would protest against the land transfer till the shifting of the university from college premises. He said the previous Punjab government transferred the forest land to the Danish school and and another huge chunk of land to (now Prime Minister) Imran Khan for his Namal College. He said the the Punjab government should utilise public land for the UoM.

Zoo curator Sakhi Joyia said the bear remained ill for about eight days due to some problem in his digestive system. 
He claimed the animal was given proper treatment and the vets from the wildlife department and the Cholistan University of Veterinary Animal Sciences Bahawalpur had tried to diagnose the disease he was suffering from but they failed and the bear expired.  
Joyia added that the post-mortem on the body of the bear was also carried out, which showed that his death was caused by defective liver. According to curator, bear was also old and died after attaining the age of about 16 years.  
The bear was shifted to the zoo from Lahore in 2014 and he was living with five female bears in the local zoo.
