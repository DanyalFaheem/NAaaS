The notional meeting of the ECC presided over by Minister for Economic Affairs Omar Ayub Khan, however, approved allocation of 10mmcfd (million cubic feet per day) gas in Sindh to Sui Southern Gas Company Limited (SSGCL) and concessionary electricity to the zero-rated industry at Lasbela in Balochistan and Sundar in Punjab.  
The ECC also approved supplementary grants of Rs330 million to the Ministry of Defence for VVIP aircraft and Rs85m to the Ministry of Interior for repair of helicopters of Punjab Rangers.  

Approves allocation of 10mmcfd gas for SSGCL, concessionary electricity to zero-rated industry  

Informed sources said the so-called technical advisory committee (TAC) of the ECC, led by Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance Shaukat Tarin, which actually takes decisions on summaries of the economic ministries, had discussed the 2021-25 policy for SMEs, but could not finalise its recommendations due to opposition from the FBR and SBP over tax exemptions and matters relating to the Rs30bn SME development fund, respectively.  
According to an official statement, the ECC also discussed a summary on the SMEs policy presented by the Ministry of Industries and Production and directed the authorities concerned to review the policy and discuss the observations raised by the relevant stakeholders under the chairmanship of Shaukat Tarin. The proposal will be submitted to the cabinet after developing a consensus with the stakeholders.  
Therefore, Mr Tarin called both the FBR and SBP to a meeting on Monday where he could delve deep into their objections, make adjustments where necessary and take a final view of the policy. There were suggestions for expanding the scope of financing support to the SMEs from less than 200,000 at present to 2-3m within the policy period. Total SMEs are estimated to be over 500,000.  
The Ministry of Industries and Production had sought reduction in taxes and exemptions from tax audits, besides collateral free loans by banks with credit line of Rs50-60 billion in addition to the SME development fund by the government worth Rs30bn for risk guarantee. The FBR had reservations over taxation proposals and the SBP over risk mitigation and subsidised interest rates.  
Regarding the auto industry development and export policy 2021-26, Minister for Interior Shaikh Rashid reportedly wanted that the policy should be for 10 years to provide confidence to the industry for investment, but Minister for Industries Khusro Bakhtiar opposed such a long commitment, saying the policy could be adjusted in line with the changing market conditions and the five-year policy horizon was enough for the auto sector for business decisions.  
A decision on the matter was deferred until the next meeting.  
The ECC approved a summary presented by the Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division) for allocation of 10mmcfd gas under commercial production from M/s United Energy Pakistan’s fields to SSGCL. United Energy will provide gas from Mitha and Bitro fields to SSGCL. The price of gas will be as per the applicable petroleum policy to be decided by the regulators concerned.  
On a summary presented by the Power Division, the ECC cleared a mechanism for granting concessionary tariff to the eligible consumers of zero-rated industrial estates of Lasbela (LIEDA) and Sundar (SIE) and to prospective industrial estates.  
The committee ordered installation of double meters at zero-rated industrial consumers of LIEDA and SIE for verification of reading by K-Electric and Lahore Electric Supply Company. The ECC also directed that subsidy claims be processed on the basis of difference of readings.  
Earlier, finance adviser Shaukat Tarin presided over a meeting of the Technical Advisory Committee and reviewed the summaries in details and presented its recommendations to the ECC, the statement said.

1,Housing loans disbursement jumps by 80pc in 5MFY22,Bankers attribute sharp increase to persistent threat of penalties from the government and the SBP.,"KARACHI:  Disbursement of low-cost housing loans jumped by 80 per cent in the  first five months of the current fiscal year apparently due to an  increasing burden of applications and a warning by the State Bank of  Pakistan (SBP) to banks for meeting targets or face penalties.
According to SBP data, the disbursement increased by Rs23.5bn during the July-November period. Bankers  said there were several reasons for a sudden increase in the  disbursement of loans while the primary reason was the persistent threat of penalties from the government and the central bank.
The  data showed that the disbursement for Mera Pakistan Mera Ghar Scheme  (MPMG) was just Rs32 million at the end of December 2020. 
The progress  was extremely slow initially as it reached Rs5.223bn at the end of June  2021.
In view of the slow progress, the SBP and the government started  pressurising banks by making it  mandatory for them to allocate 5pc of their loans for housing and  construction to achieve higher economic  growth and create a large number of jobs.

Bankers attribute sharp increase to persistent threat of penalties from the government and the SBP

On July 15, 2020, the SBP  fixed a mandatory target for banks to extend mortgage loans and  financing for developers and builders while the banks will be required  to increase their housing and construction of building loan portfolios  to at least 5pc of their private sector credit by the end of December  2021.
The central bank also decided to impose penalties on banks  falling short of their G-MSS targets with effect from July 31, 2021 —  both the number of housing units and the disbursements.
The  January-November data of calendar 2021 showed banks disbursed a total  of Rs28.744bn against approved loans of Rs99.7bn. 
However, the total  loan demand reached Rs244.9bn by end of November following an upsurge in  the applications.
In April, the SBP assigned monthly mandatory  targets of the number of housing units and amount of disbursements  (G-MSS targets government’s Mark-up Subsidy Scheme) to banks in  proportion to share in total banking assets.
The central bank said  that a baseline penalty will be charged on shortfall from cumulative  targets till July 31, 2021 while a higher penalty will be charged on  shortfall from targets of subsequent months.
The disbursement kept  increasing each month of FY22 while the highest Rs6.5bn was in  November. Earlier, Rs5.3bn was doled out in October, Rs5.4bn in  September, Rs3.8bn in August, and Rs2.5bn in July.
Before the  beginning of FY22, the Pakistan Banks’ Association (PBA), through a  consultative process, developed and circulated among banks a baseline  income estimation model.
The SBP believes that this estimation  model is expected to ease difficulties being faced by the general public  in availing the housing finance.

2,TRG sees $120m inflow with assets allocation to shareholders,"KARACHI: TRG Pakis­tan Ltd said on Friday that one of its associate companies, TRG International, has approved the...","KARACHI: TRG Pakis­tan Ltd said on Friday that one of its associate companies, TRG International, has approved the allocation of its liquid assets to shareholders that will result in an inflow of about $120 million. 
A regulatory filing said TRG Pakistan Ltd’s portion of the liquid assets will include $10m in deferred cash. In addition, the company will receive 5.4m shares of its listed portfolio company, Ibex Ltd. 
TRG Ltd holds 45 per cent of TRG International that indirectly holds 63pc of Nasdaq-listed Ibex Ltd. Therefore, the value of the received Ibex Ltd shares will be around $72m based on the company’s last closing price of $13.40 on the US shares market, according to Topline Securities. 
TRG International recently sold one of its businesses, E-Telequote. This resulted in TRG Pakistan Ltd getting an inflow of dollars in proportion to its shareholding in TRG International. 
Topline Securities said TRG Pakistan Ltd has two options to spend the liquid asset consideration of $120m: it can either distribute it through a cash dividend or announce a share buyback. “Considering local regulations, we think a buyback is difficult. If TRG Pakistan Ltd decides to announce a cash dividend, then it could be about Rs33-35 per share based on $110m of liquid assets,” it added. 
The company stated in its regulatory notice that the process and structure for the utilisation of the asset allocation will be finalised by Dec 31. 
In a separate notice, the company said Hasnain Aslam has been appointed as director and CEO of TRG Pakistan Ltd with effect from Dec 10. He’s replaced Muhammad Ziaullah Khan Chishti who resigned on Nov 29 after an employee of a TRG Pakistan Ltd-related company testified before a committee of the US Congress last month that Mr Chishti sexually assaulted her during a business trip.

3,Gas supply to non-export general industries suspended,Industry leader terms decision unjustified.,"KARACHI: The Sui Southern Gas Company Limited (SSGCL) has decided to suspend gas supply to all non-export general industries from Dec 11 (Saturday) till further orders in adherence to the energy ministry’s gas load management plan. 
The decision has been taken to make gas available to the domestic and commercial sectors during the current winter season that has seen a major demand-supply gap due to an extraordinary spike in fulfilling water and space heating needs in upper Sindh and Balochistan that is already experiencing chilly weather. 
Gas supply to the CNG sector and all Captive Power Plants (CPPs) of non-export industrial units has already been suspended till Feb 15 next year and further orders, respectively, due to the winter spike. 
However, the zero-rated export industry, including CPPs and the fertiliser sector, would continue to get the supply of gas, the SSGCL said in a statement. 

Industry leader terms decision unjustified 

The supply of additional gas is necessary in Balochistan for the survival of humans since gas serves as a lifeline to a huge population that keeps itself warm through water and space heating gas appliances in extremely low temperatures, it said. 
Chairman of the Businessmen Group Zubair Motiwala termed the SSGCL’s decision unjustified. 
He said in a statement that on one hand the government promotes industrialisation but on the other hand it suspends gas supply to the general industries. 
Mr Motiwala said he has failed to understand where the gas was going as the supply of this commodity had been suspended to CNG stations, all CPPs of non-export industries and non-export general industries. 
He pointed out that in the past a total of 211 mmcfd gas, which has now depleted to 180 mmcfd, was erroneously given to the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited from Sindh’s gas resources and said it was high time that this gas must be returned to Sindh which despite producing 76pc of country’s overall gas remains deprived. 
“I fear that gas is now going to northern parts also from Sindh,” he added. 
Motiwala said he had talked to Energy Minister Hammad Azhar about deepening gas crisis in Sindh and urged him to introduce staggering holidays for gas load-shedding in various industrial sectors which would not hit production activities and save 13pc gas. 
He urged Prime Minister Imran Khan to take notice of the gas crisis in the country, especially in Sindh.

4,PM Imran inaugurates PVC plant of Engro Polymer,"EPCL can now produce 295,000 tonnes of PVC per annum.","KARACHI: Prime Minister Imran Khan inaugurated on Friday a 100,000-tonne PVC III plant of Engro Polymer and Chemicals (EPCL), which will enable import substitution of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and boost exports, a press release said.
Addressing the ceremony, Prime Minister Khan said the government supports the expansion of local businesses in order to ensure import substitution and achieve higher exports. He urged the business community to focus on import substitution and diversification of the export base to support sustainable economic growth.
A subsidiary of Engro Corporation, EPCL is the only fully integrated chlorvinyl chemical complex and producer of PVC in Pakistan. 
The plant expansion took place with up to $50 million financing support from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and leveraged global expertise in project execution with a Japanese licenser and Chinese construction team.
EPCL can now produce 295,000 tonnes of PVC per annum. The press release said EPCL will now be contributing around $240m towards import substitution. 
The company also exported PVC resin worth $25m to Turkey and the Middle Eastern markets in 2021. Demand for PVC has grown at six per cent a year, with around 70pc of the consumption originating from the construction sector.

6,Telenor Pakistan gets operating licence renewed,ISLAMABAD: Telenor Pakistan on Friday announced that it has signed on the renewal of its operating licence up to...,"ISLAMABAD: Telenor Pakistan on Friday announced that it has signed on the renewal of its operating licence up to 2034. The company added that it will continue the court case over licensing against the telecom sector regulator Pakistan Telecom Authority (PTA) in the Supreme Court of Pakistan (SCP). 
Telenor Pakistan signed on its GSM licence renewal issued by PTA under protest at the authority’s headquarters. The renewed licence has enhanced terms and conditions for coverage and Quality of Service (QoS). 
Telenor Pakistan had several objections over the new terms and conditions made in the licence which was originally scheduled to be renewed in 2019. 
Both Telenor and Jazz obtained operating licences in 2004 for 15 years, which expired in 2019. Both the operators developed disagreement with the PTA over the price of the renewals and additional terms and conditions. 
However, after failing to resolve the issue with the telecom sector regulator, both the telcos filed a petition in the Islamabad High Court (IHC). However, they finally lost the case in September this year. 
Both Telenor and Jazz have challenged the decision of the IHC in SCP. Jazz decided to renew its operational licence in October by signing the agreement with PTA. 
Incidentally, three out of the four telecom operators in the country are at odds with the PTA. Zong 4G is contesting a case related to spectrum against the PTA in the IHC, whereas Jazz and Telenor Pakistan are fighting cases in the apex court. However, Ufone has no legal dispute with the telecom sector regulator. 
In a statement, Telenor Pakistan said the dispute with the PTA was on principled demand of providing a level playing field and fair terms and conditions for all parties. 
“We believe that the coverage and quality of services will improve through joint efforts of all stakeholder involved to ensure long-term viability and sustainability of the telecom sector,” the statement said.  
With more than 49 million customers, Telenor is the second largest mobile operator in Pakistan. 
Commenting on the development, Telenor Pakistan CEO Irfan Wahab Khan said that there was a need for collective efforts to exploit the telecom sector’s potential and bring greater value to consumers. “We look forward to the resolution of industry issues and the support from PTA towards ensuring a more conducive regulatory environment in the country,” he added.
