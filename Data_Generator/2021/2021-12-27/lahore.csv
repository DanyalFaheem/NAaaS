0,Land use conversion allowed for Rs25bn industrial project in Lahore,An official source said the LDA granted approval to the company after receiving around a Rs31 million commercialisation fee.,"LAHORE: The Punjab government has allowed conversion of land use, from agricultural purposes to industrial, for a mega project worth Rs25 billion to be launched by a Chinese company.
The permission for conversion of land use was granted to the company in a recent meeting of the Lahore Development Authority’s (LDA) governing body as per rule 13 of the LDA Land Use Rules-2020, after the Lahore district administration’s design committee and the environment protect department issued no objection certificates (NOCs) in this regard, Dawn has learnt.
“The company, through its Chief Executive Officer Mr Chen Yen, on May 22, this year had applied to the government for permission for conversion of the use of 450 kanal agricultural land for industrial purposes for launching a mega industrial project at Mauza Pandoki (Bedian Distributary). In response to the request, the government assigned the task to the respective departments to process the case under the relevant rules and regulations,” an official source told Dawn on Sunday.
He said the LDA granted approval to the company after receiving around Rs31 million commercialisation fee.
According to a document available with Dawn, under the 2020 land use rules, any industrial project worth Rs5 billion to Rs6bn (minimum) on a land measuring not less than 160 kanal is allowed to be launched on agricultural land “in a bid to attract local and foreign investment and provide jobs to the unemployed people”. However, the company offered the government to invest Rs25bn by establishing industry on the land measuring around 450 kanal.
The case was presented before the design committee in July, this year and it sought verification from Punjab Board of Investment and Trade (PBIT) regarding investment in the proposed project. The committee also sought a report from the LDA regarding non-hazardous nature of the industry as per land use rules and clarification of the rule 13 and placement of the case before the LDA governing body for further action.
Accordingly, the PBIT verified the proposed investment through a letter and the company submitted an undertaking, pledging there would be no hazardous activity on the proposed land.
Moreover, the LDA clarified that since the 2004 master plan of Lahore did not clarify in detail the provision for such land use, and preparation of a new master plan was underway, such cases could be processed under the 2020 land used rules.
The case was placed before the LDA governing body in August that constituted a committee comprising the secretaries of housing and environment departments, LDA director general and others concerned, to decide the matter.
The committee approved the proposal in principal, subject issuance of the NOC by the EPD, that later issued the same.
“The authority confirms the issuance of NOC for the conversion of land use from agricultural to industrial project on the specified land falling in Mauza Pandoki, Model Town Tehsil, Lahore,” read minutes of a recent meeting of the LDA’s governing body, presided over by Punjab chief minister.

2,First winter rain brings mercury down in Punjab,The air quality index in the Punjab capital remained high despite the drizzle.,"LAHORE: Many cities of Punjab, including Lahore, received the first winter rain on Sunday that brought the mercury down.
The provincial metropolis received traces of rain as a drizzle occurred in many areas intermittently until the afternoon.
The Met Office says that reports of a light rain were received from Lahore, Sahiwal, Vehari, Lodhran, Jhang, Pakpattan, Fort Abbas, Gojra, Arifwala, Alipur and Kabirwala. The rain will help reduce air pollution and smog while it will be beneficial for the wheat crops.
The traces of rain in Lahore reduced the maximum temperature from 19 degrees Celsius a day ago to 13 degrees Celsius on Sunday.
The chill being added to the atmosphere will bring down the minimum temperature to four degrees Celsius from the current 10 degrees Celsius in the days to come, says the local Met Office.
The air quality index in the Punjab capital remained high despite the drizzle. The ratio of pollution and the air quality index at various city points were measured to be 475 at Lahore American School, 438 at US Consulate, 437 in Model Town, 380 at Muratab Ali Road in Gulberg, 451 at Kot Lakhpat, 437 at Thokar Niaz Beg and 404 at Phase-VIII of DHA.
Air traffic at the Allama Iqbal International Airport remained suspended in the morning because of a dense layer of fog and at least 20 incoming flights were either canceled or diverted towards Islamabad and Karachi.
The flight operation was resumed in the afternoon after the weather improved following the drizzle.

3,PLRA ‘completes’ computerisation of Lahore’s land record,Additional DC hopes land record computerisation will help reduce complaints regarding frauds in property ownership documents.,"GUJRAT: The Punjab Land Record Authority (PLRA) has completed the computerisation of entire record of all the nine land registration branches of Lahore district.
The record of land mutation and property deeds of the registration branches since 1947 had been computerised to curtail the role of powerful mafias involved in making fake entries in the official data, a senior PLRA officials told Dawn.
Under the project, Lahore district had been divided into nine registration branches working under the land revenue wing of the deputy commissioner’s office, an official said.
He said the scanning of the registration deeds of property mutations in Lahore had been launched by the last PML-N government and most of the work had been completed in 2017-18 .
The official said the Lahore Deputy Commissioner Umar Sher Chatha took up the matter with Senior Member Board of Revenue (SMBR) Baber Hayat Tarrar given a large number of cases registered by the Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) against the administrative officials involved in making fake entries in the registration branches.
This, he said, prompted the PLRA to expedite the completion of land record computerisation project.
Lahore Additional Deputy Commissioner Touqeer Ilyas Cheema said special counters were being established in all the nine zones of the registration branches in the district where people could get verified computerised copies of their properties.
He said the initiative would help curb the mafias involved in forging the manual record of the registration branches with alleged connivance of the officials, saving the actual owners from lengthy litigation process.
He added it would also save the property owners, seeking verification of documents, from exploitation of the record keepers who, in many cases, were hand in glove with land mafia, helping the swindlers in getting favourable decisions from the courts.
The DC hoped the land record computerisation would help reduce the complaints in regarding frauds in the property ownership documents.
A PLRA spokesman said the officials trained to run the new system would soon be deputed at the dedicated desks of the registration branches.

5,High cost of warm clothes makes people shudder,NAROWAL: Relatively higher prices of warm clothing at city’s Landa Bazaar (flea market) have left the indigent high and dry.,"

People throng Lahore’s Landa Bazaar to buy warm clothes as mercury drops. — White Star

 
NAROWAL: Relatively higher prices of warm clothing at city’s Landa Bazaar (flea market) have left the indigent high and dry.
As the weather is turning harsh due to nip in the air, working class families are facing a great deal of inconvenience for being unable to afford woollies and other warm clothes to protect themselves against winter. Children in particular are vulnerable to illness due to unavailability of proper clothing. Philanthropists and the well-to-do have not distributed warm clothes among the indigent either, this season.
Unemployment and poverty are much higher in Narowal than in other districts of Punjab due to a lack of industrial zone. A good number of people are forced to work in Sialkot, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Lahore and other major cities for want of opportunities. Worse still, there are reports that inflation and dearness have led to loss of lives of those steeped in poverty.
The prices of warm clothes have sharply increased in Narowal’s flea market during the current cold wave. A jersey which was available for Rs100 last winter, is now being sold between Rs250 and Rs300. A jacket now costs between Rs700 and 1,000 instead of last year’s price of Rs300. Children’s warm trousers are being sold from Rs50 to 200 and a set of five socks at Rs100.
Mohammad Ibrahim and Shafqat Ali who visited the market to buy essential warm clothes deplored sharp increase in the prices which, they said, had become unaffordable for them. They said the prices of winter stuff were lower in the flea markets of Lahore and Gujranwala.
Ibrahim and Ali work in big cities to eke out a living but they are unable to buy their children proper clothes to stave off harsh weather. They said the clothes were out of their reach.
Hafeezan Bibi, Kishore Liaquat and others said that unlike previous years, businessmen and landlords had not distributed warm clothes among the needy. They said they did not afford warm clothes. Hafeezan Bibi said her children had fallen ill due to a lack of warm clothes.
Speaking to Dawn, vendors Mohammad Naseer and Fareed Ahmed said that rich would leave used warm clothes at “Dewar-e-Mehrban” every winter but they hadn’t turned up this time round.
Mian Muhammad Rafique, vice president of the District Association of Human Rights, said three people including a women had committed suicide in one month due to unemployment and poverty. He said people were reeling under immense pressure due to inflation and unemployment and called upon the government and welfare organisations to help the needy.
The people have demanded Prime Minister Imran Khan and Chief Minister Usman Bazdar to help them in the severe cold wave.

7,Punjab Notes: Language: an elusive conduit for power struggle – Part II,What prompted Mr. Jinnah in support of the language of a tiny immigrant minority was a political act more concerned...,"What prompted Mr. Jinnah in support of the language of a tiny immigrant minority was a political act more concerned with power than language itself.
As Pakistan came into being on the premise of Muslim separateness, it seemed logical that paramount importance be given what underpinned it; an arboretum of Muslim culture that alien aristocracy laid around their seat of power in Uttar Pradesh.
Bengal was thought to be cut off from the so-called Muslim cultural mainland. It was rather taken as Muslim majority region that had mélange of different Hindu cultural expressions ranging from language to performing art and from sartorial look to food. Uttar Pradesh and Punjab dominating coterie had a nagging doubt about Bengali society’s loyalty to such an ideological notion. They feared that Bengal contradicted what they had built on; Muslim exclusivity. Bengal proudly flaunted its indigenous way of life despite being Muslim. Mr Jinnah’s declaration was out of place to say the least as it ignored the new ground realities in the wake of emergence of Pakistan at a great risk to the new state he himself had helped to carve.
In the pre-partition period, it was ideals that drove the movement but in the post-partition era the ground realities would shape the realpolitik. Anybody with clear mind could see that the regions that constituted Pakistan were historically evolved entities with their distinct and diverse cultures and languages. Faith was an important but just one of the uniting links. Overemphasis on common faith was bound to backfire and it did backfire in a painful way. Consequently, the leadership failed to read the complex historical situation and paid the price.
Bengali language was accepted in 1954 as one of the national languages when language movement failed to subside despite its brutal suppression by the West Pakistan state machinery. Its acceptance was a great step forward for the Bengalis who were struggling to correct the power imbalance between two wings of the country. The issue of power sharing expressed in language conflict got finally resolved in separation and emergence of Bangladesh as an independent state but at a colossal human and material cost in the ensuing civil war. It may be called second partition which proved to be as bloody and ghoulish as the first one.
Yet another glaring example is that of Turkey which has been dominating and suppressing Kurdish minority in its uncontrollable imperialistic streak for long. The brutal display of Turkish hubris was so blatant that Kurdish language was banned in public and private life in 1980. Speaking Kurdish language and writing it was declared a criminal offence. People who dared to speak, write and sing in Kurdish would be arrested, tried and given jail term. The real purpose of suppression was the expression of Turkish power designed to break the spirit of the resilient Kurds who refused to summit to Turkish monolith. Language, one may assert, can act as a proxy for something else; power politics. It can be employed as a tool to express a group’s desire for dominance over others or a group’s expression of struggle to end the dominance of others. In other words, it is also an effective weapon in the war of hegemony which refuses to cease.
Hegemony has two important dimensions, political and cultural. Antonio Gramsci, a remarkable Italian thinker and theorist, who expounded his famous theory of cultural hegemony from jail has shown how the ruling elite manipulates and exploits value system, social habits and mores to perpetuate its worldview and maintain its dominance to the disadvantage of the non-privileged classes. Such cultural dominance signifies ruling class’s over-all dominance in power structures erected and monopolised by it. In our context the game of hegemony, power politics through cultural means, is now played by Punjabi elite coterie but with a difference. It does so with a borrowed cultural mask which it treats as its natural face in its false consciousness. With the passage of time as it gained power from its number and strong presence in the state institutions, it replaced immigrant dominance. Assuming such a role was not difficult as it had already adopted Uttar Pradesh’s language and culture introduced and imposed by British colonialists in Punjab in the aftermath of its occupation in 1849. This colonial imposition caused Punjab’s disconnect with its natural language, culture and history. Ensuing alienation was exploited by the colonial structure to strengthen its agenda. But in the wake of Pakistan movement and its transformation into a state, this alienation turned into a new tool that began to serve the interests of post-colonial state and the comprador elite in the name of faith and national integration. However, it has proved a stunningly spectacular false start as shown by the country’s political history.
For reasons not fully analysed, Punjabi clique fails to see the writing on the wall and in its naivety gets surprised by the hostile response of other nationalities to its power game presented under the guise of cultural nationalism aimed at creating homogeneity which is “Urduization or UP-ization”.
Punjabi elitist logic runs thus: we have abandoned our language and culture for the sake of Pakistan. Why can’t they do it? The counter argument from the rival side goes like this: Pakistan was created for the protection and promotion of our culture, not for its destruction. Other nationalities insist that Punjabi coterie must accede to the demands of historical diversity of the regions comprising present day Pakistan. Rejection of diversity will only create strife putting the fragile state under unbearable political pressure.
Politics of language in the wider context is the garbled message of game of power. Expression of power even when expressed in non-power terms doesn’t cease to reflect the nature of power. It can surely become more deceptive or deflective. In order to objectively study and analyse the politics of language we need to place it in the wider context of power structure with which it is organically linked. Let’s not forget that power relations that emanate from the power matrix define and determine the role of each concerned.
Language issue is more than the issue of language. As Thorstein Veblen shows us (in his ‘The Theory of the Leisure Class’) that an upper class gentleman’s walking stick is more than an aid to walking; it exhibits his power. So is language. It’s more than a means of expression; it reflects power politics. — soofi01@hotmail.com

The officer, who also worked as the Lahore Development Authority chief engineer last year, has been assigned a special task to immediately remove all bottlenecks in the way of kick-starting the critical projects stuck for the last few years. The government transferred C&W director Mr Habibul Haq Randhawa (BS-19) and posted him as the RDA chief engineer. He has also been asked to take charge of the RDA chief engineer office with an immediate effect.
According to a notification, the officers’ appointment has been made for a period of three years.
“Mr Habibul Haq Randhawa (BS-19) presently working as director (A&W-II), Punjab Highways Department (Central Zone), is hereby transferred with an immediate effect and posted as Chief Engineer (BS-20) in RDA in his own pay and scale on deputation basis for a period of three years”, reads the notification.
It is pertinent to mention that the Nullah Lai project cost includes Rs24 billion for land acquisition, resettlement or relocation of the affectees. The project, which could not start due to various technical, administrative and funding issues, has a 16.5km long dual carriageway/expressway along the banks of the Lai drain, lining and channelization of the drain, construction of bridges and culverts along the drain to connect several localities with the expressway, construction of commercial centres, and development of green areas along with the Nullah Lai. The Punjab government has also allocated Rs55 billion for the project in its annual development programme 2021-22. The expressway would end at Pindora locality after starting from Ammar Chowk.
As far as the Rawalpindi Ring Road project is concerned, the Punjab Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) in July, arrested former commissioner of Rawalpindi retired Capt Muhammad Mahmood and land acquisition collector Abbas Tabish for their alleged involvement in the ring road scam. According to the ACE, neither approval was sought from the Punjab chief minister for alignment of the ring road, nor any no-objection certificates were taken from the Capital Development Authority and the National Highway Authority. The ACE says in its investigation that the design of the project was changed to add new interchanges and the length of the road was increased from 22km to 68km and the last two kilometres would fall under the Islamabad Capital Territory.
There are also reports that the ring road’s new alignment was designed to allegedly benefit more than 50 influential people, including developers (realtors) who had also purchased 64,000 kanals reportedly.

The three-year project, costing Rs8m, will be executed in four zones: Lahore and Okara, Faisalabad, Toba Tek Singh and Burewala.
Project Manager Dr Jalal Arif says the project is aimed at developing innovative production protocols to grow fresh, healthy and uncontaminated horticultural crops as well as to minimise vegetable, fruit, ornamentals, mushrooms and herbs buying cost for home consumption.
Talking to Dawn, he says the project would make wasteland around houses in urban and peri-urban areas productive while ensuring food-safety and food-security in terms of healthy horticultural produce.
According to Mr Arif, the home gardeners selected for the project will not only be provided free seed and herbicide but also training through seminars, workshops and community meetings for capacity-building, awareness and community mobilisation.
Different winter and summer vegetables, including kale, broccoli, celery, lettuce, leek, parsley, kohlrabi, carrot, radish, turnip, cabbage, cauliflower, spinach, bottle gourd, sponge gourd, peas, beans, and beetroot will be grown at the home gardens, says Dr Arif.
The area under vegetable cultivation is stagnant in the country while rapidly-increasing population demands for more food, he says, adding that to meet the challenge of food security, home gardening is the most important as everyone can grow own vegetables in home or side lawns.
Dr Arif says a country’s food requirement can be fulfilled only by producing healthy and fresh vegetables through home gardening, which is becoming popular day by day across the world. However, in Pakistan, it is being practised only at a limited scale and is still at infancy because of lack of awareness regarding vegetable production technology, unavailability of quality seeds, lack of community involvement and poor knowledge about pest management.

The traffic police, administration and civic authorities have apparently failed in resolving the issue while the situation has worsened by the dysfunctional traffic signals at various squares, faulty traffic engineering, encroachments by the traders, double parking and lack of law enforcement.
Rehman Shaheed Road, Jail Chowk, Kutchehry Chowk, Bhimbher Road, Court Road, GTS Chowk, Circular Road, Jalalpur Jattan Road, Sargodha Road and Railway Road witness the worst traffic flow in the city.
Ambulances and vehicles carrying students of the University of Gujrat (UoG) and other educational institutions of the city are often seen stuck in the massive traffic jams.
Since a large number of education institutions and hospitals are located along the said routes, movement on these roads would take a long time for the motorists to reach any destinations within the city.
The residents of Marghzar Colony, Model Town, Shadman Colony and adjoining localities face more issues due to layered parking in front of major private hospitals on Jail Road and Bhimbher Road.
The downtown areas like Circular Road, Chowk Pakistan and Shahdaula Road are also problematic areas due to encroachments by the traders and parking of private vehicles and rickshaws by the roadside. Even the alternate roads leading towards the major city roads would often remain choked with the heavy traffic whereas hundreds of handcarts selling various items either roam the roads or permanently occupy them to sell their merchandise.
Dr Jawad, a resident of Rehman Shaheed Road, termed the traffic situation in the city pathetic and blamed the civic agencies, which had dug the roads for various works without giving any alternate traffic plan.
“We have dysfunctional traffic lights, bad sanitation, worse traffic management and pathetic road conditions. Keeping the situation in view, I think Gujrat must be ranked among the worst cities in the country at the moment,” he lamented.
It is learnt that an official of inspector rank has been performing duties of the Gujrat DSP traffic for the last couple of years due to alleged political pressure of the coalition partners of the PTI government as his transfer had been reverted at least twice.
Commenting on the situation, a spokesman for the Gujrat police said the ratio of vehicles was increasing day by day but the human resource of traffic police was not enhanced whereas with limited available resources the traffic police had to perform duties in the entire district. He added that police were well aware of the problems and they were trying their level best to address the traffic issue.
An official of the traffic police said education, engineering and enforcement were keys to discipline the traffic flow and traffic police had to ensure the enforcement, which came last of all.
He added that society lacked traffic sense and the cities like Gujrat, Lalamusa, Jalalpur Jattan and Dinga did not have proper traffic engineering mechanism.
