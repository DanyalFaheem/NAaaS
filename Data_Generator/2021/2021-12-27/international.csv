0,"Scrapped flights, Omicron deliver Christmas gut punch","Aircrew and ground staff have fallen sick or gone into quarantine after exposure to Covid, multiple airlines acknowledge.","NEW YORK: Travel headaches abound for millions worldwide on the holiday weekend with 2,200 flights cancelled on Sunday alone, tracking websites reported, as celebrants wrap up Christmas battered by Covid’s Omicron variant.
Some 7,500 flights have been grounded and tens of thousands more delayed from Friday through Sunday — one of the busiest travel periods of the year — with multiple airlines acknowledging that rising cases of Omicron have prompted staffing shortages.
Effects have rippled worldwide, and the hurt was expected to bleed into the work week, with at least 735 flights already facing cancellations on Monday and 160 more on Tuesday, according to flight tracker FlightAware. The highly transmissible Omicron strain has sent new cases soaring across the globe, with countries reviving dreaded lockdowns, major sports leagues cancelling Boxing Day football and rugby fixtures and governments including the United States scrambling to boost testing and vaccinations.
In China’s Xi’an city, 13 million residents were confined to their homes on Sunday amid tightened restrictions as the country recorded its biggest Covid-19 infection numbers in 21 months.
Desperate to keep a lid on outbreaks before February’s Beijing Winter Olympics, China has implemented a vigilant  “zero-Covid” strategy involving tight border restrictions, lengthy quarantines and targeted lockdowns. But there have been sporadic flare-ups.
In the United States on Sunday top pandemic advisor Anthony Fauci warned of a Covid  “testing problem” as the virus overwhelms the nation and he vowed to make more tests available next month.
“There are still some issues now of people having trouble getting tested,” Fauci told ABC Sunday talk show  “This Week.”  “But we’re addressing the testing problem, he added, saying it should be corrected  “very soon.” Severe weather has compounded the travel chaos in the United States, with storms battering the country’s west, though they brought a white Christmas weekend to Seattle and parts of California.
But air travel remained a global headache.
Aircrew and ground staff have fallen sick or gone into quarantine after exposure to Covid, multiple airlines acknowledged.
Lufthansa, Delta, United Airlines, JetBlue, British Airways, Alaska Airlines and several others have been forced to cancel flights.
“We entered the holiday season with the highest staffing levels we’ve had since the pandemic began and are using all resources available to us to cover our staffing needs,” JetBlue said in a statement.
“Despite our best efforts, we’ve had to cancel a number of flights, and additional flight cancellations and other delays remain a possibility as we see more omicron community spread.”
Chinese carriers, notably China Eastern and Air China, have scrubbed more than 2,000 flights over the long weekend, including many going in and out of Xi’an Xianyang International airport, according to tracker data.
Flightaware.com reports nearly 2,900 flights were canceled worldwide on Saturday, and 2,250 and counting on Sunday, with 720 of those within, originating from or headed to US airports. Some 7,200 Boxing Day flights have been delayed.

1,Putin to mull options if West refuses guarantees over Ukraine,"Reaffirms Nato membership for Ukraine or deployment of weapons is a ""red line for Moscow that it won’t allow the West to cross"".","MOSCOW: Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday he would ponder a slew of options if the West fails to meet his push for security guarantees precluding Nato’s expansion to Ukraine.
Earlier this month, Moscow submitted draft security documents demanding that Nato deny membership to Ukraine and other former Soviet countries and roll back its military deployments in Central and Eastern Europe.
Putin has urged the West to move quickly to meet the demands, warning that Moscow will have to take adequate military-technical measures if the West continues its aggressive course on the threshold of our home.
Asked to specify what such Moscow’s response could be, he said in comments aired by Russian state TV that it could be diverse, adding without elaboration that it will depend on what proposals our military experts submit to me.
The US and its allies have refused to offer Russia the kind of guarantee on Ukraine that Putin wants, citing Nato’s principle that membership is open to any qualifying country. They agreed. however, to launch security talks with Russia next month to discuss its concerns.
Putin said the talks with the US will be held in Geneva. In parallel, negotiations are also set to be held between Russia and Nato and broader discussions are expected under the aegis of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
In remarks broadcast Sunday, Putin said that Russia submitted the demands in the hope of a constructive answer from the West.
We didn’t do it just to see it blocked ... but for the purpose of reaching a negotiated diplomatic result that would be fixed in legally binding documents,” Putin said.
He reaffirmed that Nato membership for Ukraine or the deployment of alliance weapons there is a red line for Moscow that it wouldn’t allow the West to cross.
We have nowhere to retreat, he said, adding that Nato could deploy missiles in Ukraine that would take just four or five minutes to reach Moscow. They have pushed us to a line that we can’t cross. They have taken it to the point where we simply must tell them; Stop!” He voiced concern that the US and its allies could try to drag out the security talks and use them as a cover to pursue a military buildup near Russia.
He noted that Russia published its security demands to make them known to the public and raise the pressure on the US and its allies to negotiate a security deal.
We have just one goal to reach agreements that would ensure the security of Russia and its citizens now and in a long-term perspective, he said.
The Kremlin presented its security demand amid the tensions over a Russian troop buildup near Ukraine in recent weeks that has fueled Western fears of a possible invasion. US President Joe Biden warned Putin in a video call earlier this month that Russia will face severe consequences if it attacks Ukraine.
Russia has denied an intention of launching an invasion and, in its turn, accused Ukraine of hatching plans to try to reclaim control of the territories held by Moscow-backed rebels by force. Ukraine has rejected the claim.
Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and shortly after threw its support behind a separatist rebellion in the country’s east. Over more than seven years, the fighting has killed over 14,000 people and devastated Ukraine’s industrial heartland, known as the Donbas.

2,China records highest daily rise in Covid cases,"Xian, with 485 local symptomatic cases reported for Dec 9-25 period, has imposed heavy-handed measures to rein in the outbreak.","BEIJING: China reported its highest daily rise in local Covid-19 cases in 21 months as infections more than doubled in the northwestern city of Xian, China’s latest Covid hot spot.
The city of 13 million, which entered its fourth day of lockdown, detected 155 domestically transmitted cases with confirmed symptoms for Saturday, up from 75 a day earlier, official data showed on Sunday.
That drove the national daily count to 158, the highest since China managed to contain a nationwide outbreak in early 2020. Xian, with 485 local symptomatic cases reported for the Dec 9-25 period, has imposed heavy-handed measures to rein in the outbreak, in line with Beijing’s policy that any flare-up should be contained as soon as possible.
The city managed to quickly detect those cases through three rounds of mass testing, He Wenquan, a Xian official, told a press conference on Sunday, adding that high case numbers could persist into the next couple of days.
“In order to quickly screen out the infected groups of people, after an analysis by experts, we will step up control measures in key areas, especially places with greater risk level,” said He.  The local government also announced that it would launch a city-wide disinfection campaign from 18:00 local time, urging residents to shut the windows and bring clothes or other items inside from their balconies.
Residents may not leave town without approval from employers or local authorities and multiple rounds of mass testing were conducted to identify cases.
The city has announced no infections caused by the Omicron variant, although Chinese authorities have reported a handful of Omicron infections among international travellers and in southern China.

3,Belgian artists decry virus rules,"BRUSSELS: Thousands of Belgian performers, cinema operators, event organisers and others joined together on Sunday ...","BRUSSELS: Thousands of Belgian performers, cinema operators, event organisers and others joined together on Sunday to protest the government’s decision to close down the country’s cultural life to stem the spread of the surging omicron variant.
Waving posters reading  “The show must go on” or No culture, no future, the crowd demonstrated peacefully despite the pouring rain, accusing the government of unfairly targeting the culture industry with the new virus restrictions.
Under the measures, which took effect Sunday, events like Christmas markets are allowed to continue, despite their boisterous, chaotic gluhwein (mulled wine) parties, and restaurants and bars are allowed to stay open with some new restrictions.
Even the scientific committee advising the Belgian government had not asked for the culture industry closures, leaving virologist Marc Van Ranst to ponder that in Belgium gluhwein beat culture. Scores of movie theaters and other venues disregarded the closure order, according to state broadcaster RTBF.
A brass band accompanied Sunday’s demonstration at the Mont des Arts in Brussels, the symbolic spot which spawned Belgian independence in 1830, and prominent cultural figures took to the stage to air their grievances. Organisers urged participants to wear masks and maintain social distancing. Authorities estimated 5,000 people took part and it ended peacefully.

4,Tutu on assisted dying: ‘I have prepared for my death’,JOHANNESBURG: Archbishop Des­­­mond Tutu built a lifelong reputation for championing underdogs and challenging ...,"JOHANNESBURG: Archbishop Des­­­mond Tutu built a lifelong reputation for championing underdogs and challenging the status quo on issues like race, homosexuality and religious doctrine.
Towards the end of his life, he began a new campaign in support of the assisted dying movement — a hugely sensitive subject in his Anglican Church. “I have prepared for my death and have made it clear that I do not wish to be kept alive at all costs,” he said in an opinion piece in The Washington Post in 2016.
At the time, he was in and out of hospital for a recurring infection linked to prostate cancer, an illness he was diagnosed with in 1997.
“Dying people should have the right to choose how and when they leave Mother Earth,” he wrote.
‘I wouldn’t mind’
The Nobel laureate’s outspoken editorial propelled the issue to the forefront of public debate and challenged the Anglican Communion’s position on the emotionally charged subject.
Only a handful of countries allow some form of voluntary euthanasia, where a doctor helps the patient to die, or assisted dying, where a terminally ill individual ends their own lives.
In South Africa, euthanasia is a crime punishable by 14 years in jail, though no such sentence has ever been handed down.
South Africa’s Supreme Court of Appeal last year blocked a bid by a man with prostate cancer to secure the right to a medically assisted death, which could have opened the way to legalise voluntary euthanasia.
The Church of England still opposes assisted dying, stating in 2015 that if it was legalised in the UK it  “would allow individuals to participate actively in ending others’ lives, in effect agreeing that their lives are of no further value”.
“This is not the way forward for a compassionate and caring society,” the Church said. The Anglican Church in South Africa refused to comment on the issue when contacted.
Before his landmark intervention, Tutu had previously on the issue of assisted dying:  “I would say I wouldn’t mind.” In a 2014 article for Britain’s Guardian newspaper, he chided those around former president Nelson Mandela who had sought to keep him alive. Mandela died aged 95.
“What was done to Madiba was disgraceful,” Tutu wrote, using Mandela’s honorific name.
“There was that occasion when Madiba was televised with political leaders... You could see Madiba was not fully there... It was an affront to Madiba’s dignity.” Right-to-die activists heralded Tutu’s 2016 article as a game-changer in their fight for assisted suicide to be legalised and ultimately de-stigmatised.
‘A courageous effort’ 
Sean Davison, the director of assisted dying campaign group Dignity South Africa, said:  “When Tutu speaks, the world listens... Maybe this is something we should be talking about rather than closing the discussion completely.” Even some senior religious figures praised him for stoking debate on an issue that has sharply divided the clerical establishment.
“The archbishop has done a wonderful service to us,” said Father Anthony Egan, a Jesuit priest and lecturer at South Africa’s Wits University.

Births in Italy last year hit their lowest level since the unification of the nation in 1861, the national statistics office said this month, with the figure falling for a 12th consecutive year.
“The demographic winter is a real worry, at least here in Italy,” the pope said in his weekly address in front of St. Peter’s Basilica.
“It seems that a lot of people have lost the wish to have children. Lots of couples prefer to remain childless or to have one child only. ... It’s a tragedy ... which runs counter to our families, our country and our future.” 
There were 404,892 births in Italy last year, the ISTAT statistics office said, down 15,192 from 2019. There were 746,146 deaths in 2020 as the population fell to 59.3 million.
ISTAT said the slump in births had continued this year, adding that the Covid-19 pandemic appeared to be a factor in the decline.

6,Bodies of 27 migrants wash ashore in Libya,"CAIRO: The bodies of 27 Europe-bound migrants, including a baby and two women, have washed ashore in western Libya,...","CAIRO: The bodies of 27 Europe-bound migrants, including a baby and two women, have washed ashore in western Libya, the country’s Red Crescent said, describing the latest tragedy involving migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea in pursuit of better lives in Europe.
The bodies were found late on Saturday in two separate locations in the coastal town of Khoms, about 120 kilometres (75 miles) east of the capital of Tripoli, the Red Crescent’s branch there said. Three other migrants were rescued, and search efforts were underway for others, it said.
The Red Crescent, a Muslim organisation equivalent to the Red Cross, posted images it said showed bodies floating in the Mediterranean Sea with its workers putting them in black burial bags.
The bodies were then taken to the morgue of Khoms hospital, said Dr Osama al-Saket, the hospitals director. He said their burial was a challenge to local authorities given the large number of bodies. They mostly can deal with one or two bodies, not as today, he said.
The dead migrants likely drowned in recent shipwrecks off Libya. There has been a surge in crossings and attempted crossings from Libya as authorities accelerated their deadly crackdown on migrants in the capital of Tripoli.
Around 1,500 migrants have drowned in boat mishaps and shipwrecks on the route across the central Mediterranean this year, according to the UN migration agency.
Earlier this month, more than 160 migrants drowned in two separate shipwrecks off the North African country, the International Organisation for Migration said.
Libya plunged into turmoil by the Nato-backed 2011 uprising that toppled and killed longtime 
dictator Moammar Qadhafi. The North African nation has since emerged as a popular, if extremely dangerous, route towards Europe for those fleeing poverty and civil war in Africa and the Middle East.
Human traffickers have benefited from the chaos in the oil-rich nation, smuggling migrants through the country’s lengthy border with six nations. They pack desperate migrants into ill-equipped rubber boats, then embark on risky voyages through the perilous Mediterranean Sea.
Those returned have been taken to detention centers rife with abuses, including forced labor, beatings, rapes and torture. The abuse often accompanies efforts to extort money from families before migrants are allowed to leave Libya on traffickers boats.
UN-commissioned investigators said in October they found that the practice of arbitrary disappearances and violence against migrants inside Libyan prisons could amount to crimes against humanity.

7,Switzerland to allow simple gender transition from Jan 1,Anyone aged 16 and above who is not under legal guardianship will be able to adjust their gender and name by self-declaration.,"ZURICH: People in Switzerland will be able to legally change gender by a visit to the civil registry office from Jan 1, putting the country at the forefront of Europe’s gender self-identification movement.
Switzerland joins Ireland, Belgium, Portugal and Norway as one of the few countries on the continent that allow a person to legally change gender without hormone therapy, medical diagnosis or further evaluation or bureaucratic steps.
Under the new rules written into Switzerland’s civil code, anyone aged 16 and above who is not under legal guardianship will be able to adjust their gender and legal name by self-declaration at the civil registry office. Younger people and those under adult protection will require guardian consent.
This marks a change from the current set of regionally prescribed standards in Switzerland, which often require a certificate from a medical professional confirming an individual’s transgender identity.
Some cantons — semi-autonomous regions in federal Switzerland — also require a person to undergo hormone treatment or anatomical transition in order to legally change gender, while, for a name change, proof could be required that the new name has already been unofficially in use for several years.
Switzerland, long known as socially conservative in the main, voted in September to legalise civil marriage and the right to adopt children for same-sex couples, one of the last countries in Western Europe to do so.
With the new gender change rules, Switzerland joins just two dozen countries worldwide aiming to decouple gender choice from medical procedures.
While some other European nations including Denmark, Greece and France have removed the requirement of medical procedures, including sex reassignment surgery, sterilisation or psychiatric evaluation, their rules require further steps or conditions.
Spain in June approved a draft bill allowing anyone over the age of 14 to change gender legally without a medical diagnosis or hormone therapy. 
Germany in 2018 became the first European government to introduce a third gender option but in June 2021 shot 
down two bills aiming to introduce gender self-identification. A new transgender member of parliament is hoping to address that.

8,"Iran, Hezbollah aid strikes by Houthis: Saudi-led coalition",Coalition spokesperson says Houthis are “militarising” Sanaa airport.,"RIYADH: The Saudi-led coalition on Sunday accused Iran and Hezbollah of helping Yemen’s Houthi rebels to launch missiles and drones at the kingdom, where two people were killed.
Since the coalition intervened almost seven years ago to support Yemen’s government, Saudi Arabia has regularly accused Iran of supplying the Houthis with sophisticated weapons and Hezbollah of training the insurgents.
Tehran denies the charges. Lebanon’s Iran-backed Shia militant movement Hezbollah has previously denied sending fighters or weapons to Yemen.
The latest Saudi accusation came as the coalition intensified an aerial bombing campaign against the Iran-backed Houthis in retaliation for deadly attacks on the kingdom.
Coalition spokesman Turki al-Malki told a news conference the Houthis were  “militarising” Sanaa airport and using it as a  “main centre for launching ballistic missiles and drones” towards the kingdom.
Malki showed reporters a video clip which he said depicted  “the headquarters of Iranian and Hezbollah experts at the airport” where, he alleged,  “Hezbollah is training the Houthis to booby-trap and use drones”.
Malki showed other clips which he said showed a Hezbollah member placing explosives in a drone, and a man he identified as a Hezbollah official telling Houthi members  “we must strengthen our ranks”. The footage could not be independently verified.
The Arab military coalition led by Riyadh intervened in Yemen in 2015 to back the internationally recognised government, a year after the Houthis overran the capital Sanaa.
Since then, tens of thousands of people have been killed, in what the United Nations has described as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.
The Houthis come from the minority Zaidi Shia sect of Islam and have their traditional stronghold in the mountainous north of Yemen.
Between 2004 and 2010, they fought six wars against Yemen’s then-government and battled Saudi Arabia in 2009-2010 after storming over the border.
The deaths of two people overnight from a rebel missile strike on the Saudi city of Jazan were the first such deaths in the kingdom in three years.
On Sunday, Malki said the international community must  “stop hostile acts by this terrorist organisation,” a reference to Hezbollah.
Since January 2018, he said, the Houthis have launched 430 ballistic missiles and 850 drones towards Saudi Arabia. Earlier Sunday the coalition said it had struck a Houthi rebel camp in Sanaa, destroying weapons warehouses.
On Saturday, the coalition launched what it called a  “large-scale” military operation against the Houthis after the rebel missile strike that hit Jazan.
The coalition raids left three civilians dead, including a child and a woman, Yemeni medics said.
Rights groups have criticised the coalition for civilian casualties in its years-long aerial bombardment.
The coalition maintains its operations are carried out in accordance with international humanitarian law, repeatedly urging the Houthis against using civilians as human shields.
Malki also accused Iran’s ambassador to Sanaa, who died of Covid-19 last week after his evacuation from Yemen, of  “leading the planning of military operations in Marib” — the Yemeni government’s last stronghold in the north.
The Houthis warned in a statement that they will  “face escalation with escalation”.
World powers and the kingdom’s Gulf Arab allies condemned the rebels’ deadly strike on Saudi Arabia.
“Houthi attacks are perpetuating the conflict, prolonging the suffering of the Yemeni people, and endangering the Saudi people alongside more than 70,000 US citizens residing in Saudi Arabia,” Washington’s embassy to Riyadh said in a statement.
Ludovic Pouille, the French ambassador to Riyadh, on Twitter offered condolences to families of the victims of the  “barbaric Houthi attack”.
The coalition has intensified its air strikes on Sanaa, including last week on what it called  “military targets” at the airport. United Nations aid flights were interrupted as a result.
The insurgents often launch missiles and drones into Saudi Arabia aimed at its airports and oil infrastructure.
The UN’s World Food Programme said it has been  “forced” to cut aid to Yemen due to lack of funds, and warned of a surge in hunger.

9,Covid-19 stunts growth of US population,It is the first time since 1937 that the country’s population grew by fewer than one million people.,"WASHINGTON: The Covid-19 pandemic has had a major impact on population growth as well, as the US population grew at a slower rate in 2021 than in any other year since the founding of this nation.
Statistics released by the US Census Bureau showed that in 2021 the US population grew only 0.1 percent and this is the first time since 1937 that the country’s population grew by fewer than one million people.
This was also the lowest numeric growth since at least 1900, when the Census Bureau began annual population estimates.
Apart from the last few years, when population growth slowed to historically low levels, the slowest rate of growth in the 20th century was from 1918-1919 amid the influenza pandemic and World War I.
The new estimates show that in 2021, the population growth declined from the previous year in 31 of 50 states, with 18 states sustaining absolute population losses.
In some states, population losses were exacerbated by inflated out-migration during the pandemic, although Florida and Texas benefitted from greater population in-flows.
The bureau noted that slower population growth has been a trend in the United States for several years, which is the result of decreasing fertility and net international migration, combined with increasing mortality due to an aging population.
Since the mid-2010’s, births and net international migration in the US have been declining at the same time deaths have been increasing. The collective impact of these trends is slower population growth.
The bureau noted that “this trend has been amplified by the Covid-19 pandemic, resulting in a historically slow population increase in 2021.”

10,"Bird flu outbreak kills 2,000 cranes in Israel","Another 10,000 are believed to be infected, says specailist.","JERUSALEM: A bird flu outbreak has killed more than 2,000 wild cranes on a reserve in northern Israel, an unusually high toll for the seasonal flu, the parks authority said on Sunday.
In addition to the 2,000 dead, another 10,000 are believed to be infected, Ohad Hatsofe, a specialist at the Israel Nature and Parks Authority, said.
The virus affects Israel annually, but this year’s outbreak is much larger than previous years, said Uri Naveh, a senior scientist at the authority. Naveh described the number of dead cranes as  “exceptional”.
Like every year, roughly 100,000 wild cranes reached Israel since October, most stopping in the Hula Valley, an important point on their migratory path towards Africa.
More than 40,000 cranes are estimated to have remained in the area.
The avian flu ravaging the population, H5N1, has been detected in some chicken populations in northern Israel, Israel’s agriculture ministry said.
The ministry has suspended egg sales from affected farms.
It is rare for H5N1 to spread among humans, but there have been past outbreaks.
According to the World Health Organisation H5N1 has killed more than 450 people, mainly in Indonesia, Egypt and Vietnam, since 2003.

11,Suicide bomber kills five at bar packed for Xmas in DR Congo,BENI: A suicide bomber killed at least five people at a crowded night spot in the city of Beni in the eastern...,"BENI: A suicide bomber killed at least five people at a crowded night spot in the city of Beni in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo on Saturday, local officials reported.
Officials blamed the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) militia, one of the deadliest armed groups in the region and claimed by the militant Islamic State group as its central Africa arm.
“The suicide bomber, prevented by security from gaining access to the bar, packed with clients, activated the bomb at the entrance,” said a statement from military officials running North Kivu province. Another 13 people were being treated for their wounds in hospitals, the statement added, describing the death toll as provisional.
Shortly after the blast, Narcisse Muteba, the colonel running the city during the state of emergency in the east of the country, had called on residents to return to their homes for their own safety.
A correspondent saw the remains of three bodies at the site of the explosion, the In Box restaurant. The remains of tables, chairs, bottles and glasses were scattered across the blast site.
One city hall source said that two children were among the dead, as well as two local officials.
More than 30 people were celebrating Christmas there when the bomb went off, two witnesses said.
“I was sitting there,” local radio presenter Nicolas Ekila said.  “There was a motorbike parked there. Suddenly the motorbike took off, then there was a deafening noise.” A police vehicle took the wounded to a nearby medical centre, which was immediately sealed off.
On June 27 in Beni, a blast from a improvised bomb at a Catholic church wounded two women, the same day a man died when the bomb he was carrying went off.
The day before, another device blew up near a service station without doing any damage. The authorities blamed those attacks on the ADF.
Beni, in North Kivu province on the DRC’s eastern border with Uganda, has been the site of regular clashes between the army and the ADF.
North Kivu and neighbouring Ituri province have been under a  “state of siege” since May, an emergency measure in which the military has taken effective control but which so far has not succeeded in stopping the attacks from the armed militia.
On November 30, the DRC and Uganda launched a joint operation against the ADF in the east of the country to try to quell the bloody ADF attacks. Uganda has also blamed the group for a string of attacks on its territory.
The ADF was historically a Ugandan rebel coalition whose biggest group comprised Muslims opposed to Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni.
But it established itself in eastern DRC in 1995, becoming the deadliest of scores of outlawed forces in the troubled region.
It has been blamed for the killings of thousands of civilians over the past decade in the DRC, as well as for bombings in the Ugandan capital Kampala.
The militant Islamic State group presents the ADF as its regional branch — the Islamic State Central Africa Province, or ISCAP.
On March 11 this year, the United States placed the ADF on its list of  “terrorist groups” affiliated with IS jihadists.

But the inflatable boat he took along with around 30 other irregular migrants would never reach British shores.
Nearly a month after at least 27 of those migrants drowned, families of 16 of them finally got some closure on Sunday as their bodies arrived in Iraqi Kurdistan.
The remains arrived before dawn at the airport in the Iraqi Kurdish regional capital Arbil, where dozens of men, women and children had gathered.
Among the mourners, some embraced and black-clad women wept while others showed pictures of their lost kin.
Clutching his cane to his chest, an elderly man with a white beard showed a photo on his phone of his son Afrasia, who was just 24 years old.
The November 24 tragedy has been described by the International Organisation for Migration as the largest single loss of life in the English Channel since the UN agency started recording data in 2014.
The plain wooden coffins were placed in ambulances that transported them to their hometowns of Darbandikhan, Qadrawa, Ranya and Soran.
A woman sobbed as she pressed her face up against a window pane. Close by, two teenagers appeared similarly shaken. One of them rested his head against a casket, bidding his final farewell.
In the centre of Ranya, hundreds gathered in a mosque to honour the three victims from the Kurdish town.
The bodies were washed in the traditional Muslim way. The crowd filled a large prayer hall, and in the heavy silence, the murmurs of funerary prayers could be heard.
Shakar Ali, 30, left his home two months ago, making the long trip via Turkey, Greece, then Italy, before his Mediterranean journey ended in France.
“He attempted the crossing to Britain seven times,” his older brother Shamal said.  “Each time, he failed.” Three years earlier, Shakar, who had a degree in petroleum geology, was searching for a job.“He was unemployed until his departure,” his brother, a teacher, continued.
