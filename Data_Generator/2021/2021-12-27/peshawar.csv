Talash Dushkhel Qaumi Islahi Jirga was held at the residence of Dr Noor Mohammad in Kalpani Talash with its chief Malik Taj Mohammad Khan in the chair.
Speaking on this occasion, Malik Taj, Dr Noor, Syed Hassan Advocate, Ghulam Rashid and others said frequent incidents of killings had worried the locals.

They said the Talash valley was famous for peace, harmony and brotherhood in the Upper and Lower Dir districts, but the migrants were destroying this tranquility. 
The speakers said the police had arrested the accused in the murder cases, but they were set free because of the flawed justice system.
The jirga members decided to meet deputy commissioner Aun Haidar Gondal, district police officer Irfanullah and local MPAs to apprise them of the unrest among people.

During the ongoing month, drivers of more than 410 rickshaws and 4,114 overloaded vehicles were fined and 87 rickshaws impounded.

2,Govt’s role in economy limits space for entrepreneurs: PIDE,ISLAMABAD: The investment climate in Pakistan is very pragmatic and needs various corrective measures like ...,"ISLAMABAD: The investment climate in Pakistan is very pragmatic and needs various corrective measures like decreasing the government’s footprint in the economy.
This was pointed out by economist and vice chancellor of Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) Dr Nadeemul Haque and leading researcher Dr Durre Nayab while talking to a group of journalists and writers in Islamabad.
They said the greater the role of the government in the economy, lesser the space available for entrepreneurs to function, adding that the challenge was to significantly raise investment rate and productivity as these were major drivers of growth but were relatively low.
Referring to a detailed report titled ‘Reform Agenda for Accelerated and Sustained Growth’, they said research laid down the reform agenda, pursuit of which would put the country on a high and sustained growth trajectory.
For there to be a stable democracy, Dr Haque suggested proportional representation in the electoral system must be adopted which meant that for political parties to be eligible to contest elections, the parties must have elections within the party as well.
“A certain, minimal percentage of the provincial population must be inducted as party members. The legislators should not have any say in the approval and execution of development projects. Only a small proportion, maybe 5pc, of the legislators may hold executive positions, the rest should be legislators only, Dr Haque said, adding that there should be a maximum term limit (maybe two terms) for the prime minister and all the legislators.
“Additionally, the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) Funds should be decentralised and federal and provincial governments should focus only on policy formulation,” he added.
Dr Durre Nayab said cities were believed to be the engine of economic growth.
“The cities that encourage economic activity are dense, high-rise, mixed-use and inclusive. These cities provide work, home, markets, school, hospital and leisure for all close to each other. 
“By clustering economic activities, these cities generate knowledge spill overs, on the one hand, and reduce transaction costs on the other. This is an environment conducive to innovation, which is crucial for economic growth,” she said.

3,Inquiry into Riaz Fatyana’s allegations about cabinet members concludes,"Decision to be announced soon, govt spokesman says.","ISLAMABAD: The Standing Committee on Accountability and Discipline (SCAD) has completed inquiry and reserved its ruling in the MNA Riaz Fatyana case, who alleged that a brawl between two personalities from the Ministry of Climate Change compromised Pakistan’s position at an international conference.
“MNA Riaz Fatyana has submitted a written response with the Standing Committee on Accountability. The committee will announce its decision soon,” a government spokesman told Dawn on Sunday.
In December, the PTI had issued a show-cause notice to its MNA Riaz Fatyana for allegedly making “unreasonable” demands at the recently held climate conference in Glasgow, United Kingdom and making “false” allegations against two members of the federal cabinet.

Decision to be announced soon, govt spokesman says

The notice was issued to the MNA from Toba Tek Singh on the complaint of Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam, days after Mr Fatyana alleged that the former had a brawl with Minister of State for Climate Change Zartaj Gul while attending the conference.
Mr Fatyana made the allegations during a meeting of the parliament’s Public Accounts Committee on Nov 25 and this was widely covered by the media. He had thus forth been asked to submit a written statement on or before Dec 4, along with relevant documents and evidence. “You have to show cause as to why we should not proceed against you. The nature of this disciplinary proceeding shall be inquisitorial,” the notice issued to Mr Fatyana stated.
“Upon your return, as a member of the Public Accounts Committee, you have made some absurd and totally fabricated and false assertions in the meeting held on Nov 25, including that there was a brawl between two senior officials and Zartaj Gul, which led to her leaving the conference early. However, she had left early only to attend the joint session of the parliament,” read the notice, a copy of which is available with Dawn.
“This false news was taken up by the media and caused irreparable damage to the personal reputation of the complainant, the party’s image as well as performance of Pakistan at the COP-26 which got national as well as global acclaim,” it added.
In his complaint, Mr Aslam alleged that MNA Riaz Fatyana had come to Glasgow to attend the conference on climate change funded by a non-governmental organisation (NGO) and visited the Pakistani pavilion a couple of times where he made some “unreasonable demands” such as becoming part of the official delegation, which needed the prime minister’s approval.
Mr Aslam also alleged that Mr Fatyana had demanded an official vehicle and phone SIMs for his use, “but these could, obviously, not be met as he was not part of official country delegation”.
When contacted, Mr Aslam told Dawn that he and Ms Gul had issued a joint statement denying any brawl or misunderstanding at COP-26 and termed the allegations made by Riaz Fatyana “baseless”.
“Riaz Fatyana has submitted his response with the Standing Committee on Accountability and Disciplineand now we are waiting for the outcome,” said Mr Aslam, maintaining that Mr Fatyana was not a part of Pakistan’s official delegation and was representing a non-governmental organisation without any invitation of the Ministry of Climate Change.
Despite several attempts to contact Mr Fatyana, he could not be reached for comment.

4,KP health facilities showing poor performance to be outsourced,A notification has asked the relevant officials to make recommendations in this regard.,"PESHAWAR: The authorities have decided to outsource primary and secondary health facilities in the areas where the health indicators are not up to the mark.
A notification, issued by the health secretary on December 24, has asked the relevant officials to make recommendations in this regard.
A seven-member committee with director-general health services as its head has been constituted to make recommendations within the ambit of the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Act 2020 for outsourcing the health facilities, the operations of which are not up to desired level.
The notification has been issued after the approval of the provincial cabinet. The meeting of the provincial cabinet was held last month.
The committee also includes regional directors general health of four regions and chief of health sector reforms unit. 

Body set up to give recommendations for the purpose

The panel has been tasked to recommend primary care facilities for outsourcing in line with PPP Act based on identified indicators and parameters which may include complete district or cluster of facilities.
According to terms of reference for the committee, the health secretary has asked it to send proposals for outsourcing the facilities based on the performance review across the specified indicators of selected category, A, B, C and D type of hospitals in the province. 
Additionally, the committee has also been directed to furnish recommendations to contract the ancillary services to strengthen health delivery system.
Health Secretary Mohammad Tahir Orakzai told Dawn that the move was in line with PPP Act 2020 to run the health facilities in collaboration with the partner organisations. 
The management of the outsourced facilities would remain with the health department, he added.
The government has already outsourced 10 health facilities in tribal districts where the situation regarding health delivery indicators has shown improvement.
“Nine more hospitals are ready to be contracted out within a month while two more would be advertised for the purpose soon. We are also in the process of outsourcing three regional blood centres to cater to the demand of blood required by patients in hospitals in different districts,” said the health secretary.
He said that the process would be completed under the relevant law through Health Foundation, which was supposed to ensure the operations of the health facilities through the PPP Act.
Mr Orakzai said that they wanted to make sure availability of medicines, equipment and human resources in the local hospitals for the benefit of the patients, who could be treated there. He added that the government was taking steps to improve patients’ care at grassroots level and lessen burden on the tertiary care facilities.
Last month, the department notified tehsil headquarters hospitals Topi and Chota Lahor as constituents of the medical teaching institution Bacha Khan Medical Complex Swabi that also showed improvement.
BMC Director Dr Khalid Masud told Dawn that the two facilities had been upgraded to tehsil headquarters hospitals some three years ago but their performance was not good. 
“Last month, we received directives to take over both the facilities and so far we have started admission, surgeries and other procedures there,” he said.
He said that both the facilities faced power outages for hours and they installed electric generators to ensure uninterrupted power supply. 
“Each facility has 110 beds and over 20 doctors,” he added.
Dr Khalid said that as per directives of the board of governors, they started deputing one physician and one surgeon to conduct OPD for one day every week and refer the patients to BMC for surgeries and other procedures. 
BMC had 18 specialties and about 1,000 patients visited its OPD daily, he added.
Dr Khalid said that the referral of patients to Peshawar was reduced by 60 per cent as they treated the sick people locally and only those with complicated diseases were referred to Peshawar for tertiary care.

9,No one should object to return of Nawaz Sharif: ANP,Hoti says former premier should play role in politics,"DERA ISMAIL KHAN: Awami National Party provincial senior vice-president Ameer Haider Khan Hoti has said that no one should object to return of Nawaz Sharif to his homeland.
He said that Nawaz Sharif was a Pakistani citizen, who had been the prime minister of the country for three times. He should return home to play his role in the politics of the country and no one should object to his return to his homeland, he added.
Mr Hoti was talking to journalists at Marwat House here on Saturday after offering fateha for the departed soul of ANP candidate for tehsil mayor slot Umar Khitab Sherani.
He said that Prime Minister Imran Khan was venting his anger on party organisation after facing humiliating defeat in local bodies’ elections in 19 districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Hoti says former premier should play role in politics

He said that Imran Khan dissolved his party organisations after defeat in local government polls. 
“The party organisations are not responsible for his defeat but in reality his bad governance, incompetency, inflation and deals with the International Monetary Fund are main causes for the defeat,” he added.
Mr Hoti said that the ruling party saw transparent elections for the first time as it was in the habit of enjoying ‘selection’. The elections showed the real position of the ruling party, he added.
To a question, he said that ANP had not made any decision so far regarding reorganisation of the party. “No one in ANP can make all the decisions alone. ANP is a democratic party and we held a meeting yesterday. We will hold another meeting tomorrow regarding the cause of defeat in the local bodies’ elections,” he added.
Mr Hoti said that ANP accepted results of the elections as all other parties. “When there is no external interference, the political parties will accept it with open heart,” he added.
Mr Hoti said that possibility of terrorism in the assassination of ANP leader in Dera Ismail Khan could not be ruled out but political motives behind it should also be considered. He added that the assassination of Umar Khitab Sherani was an attempt to get ANP out of the process of local bodies’ elections.
“We neither expect justice from the incumbent government, nor demand of it to arrest the killers. We demand of the state to provide justice to us,” he said.
The ANP leader said officials of security forces, police and health department besides political activists were targeted by terrorists in tribal districts. The incidents should be probed and the perpetrators should be brought to justice, he added.
He termed assassination of Umar Khitab Sherani a great loss for the party. He said that history of ANP was full of sacrifices.
