ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leaders on Sunday lashed out at the Sharif family for being involved in preparing former Gilgit-Baltistan chief judge Rana Shamim’s affidavit against ex-chief justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar and thwarting justice by “buying influence or physically attacking” the Supreme Court. 
On the other hand, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), while reacting to the statements of the PTI leaders, claimed that reports about the return of self-exiled party supremo Nawaz Sharif from London were giving sleepless nights to the government.     
In their statements, the PTI leaders called the Sharif family “Sicilian mafia”, saying that media had revealed that Rana Shamim’s affidavit was notarised in the office of Nawaz Sharif. 
In a tweet, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said: “The latest developments have once again exposed the Sharif family to be the Sicilian mafia and how, like a mafia, they possess the power to blackmail the courts and institutions.”
In the affidavit which came into the limelight last month, Rana Shamim accused the former Supreme Court chief justice of colluding with the Islamabad High Court (IHC) judge in denying bail to the PML-N leadership before the 2018 general elections. 
A media report quoted Charles D. Guthrie — the London-based solicitor who had notarised Shamim’s affidavit — as saying that the document was notarised at an office in Stanhope Place in Marble Arch, London, that belonged to the Flagship Developments Limited, of which Nawaz Sharif’s son, Hasan Nawaz, was a director and where the senior PML-N leaders often held their meetings. 
“In the evidence, Guthrie has confirmed three times that Shamim was present at Marble Arch,” the story claims, adding that the notary implied that Rana Shamim was a close friend of Nawaz’s. 
The solicitor also indicated that Nawaz Sharif was present when Rana Shamim signed the affidavit and took oath.
Citing the “evidence”, the report said when asked if “they were like quite cozy when they were in (Sharif’s office),” Guthrie replied: “Very… yeah.” 
The ruling PTI leaders, who have been claiming that Rana Shamim was operating on the orders of the PML-N leadership, termed media reports as a validation of their stance. 
Human Rights Minister Shireen Mazari said the Sharifs “just cannot move beyond trying to thwart justice through buying influence or physically attacking” the Supreme Court. 
“From assault on SC to calls to Justice Qayyum to this latest affidavit saga, it’s a repeated story of corruption on all fronts,” she added. 
In the affidavit highlighted in media last month, Rana Shamim allegedly stated that Saqib Nisar during his visit to Gilgit-Baltistan had made a call to an IHC judge and asked him to ensure that former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam were not released on bail before July 25, 2018 general elections.  
Saqib Nisar, meanwhile, rejected the allegations, terming them [allegations] “absolutely untrue”.
On Dec 7, Rana Shamim had confirmed the contents of the document in the IHC but said he had neither circulated nor shared the affidavit with anyone.
The affidavit was finally submitted in court — more than a month after it first came to light. 
PML-N’s reaction 
“The fear of Nawaz Sharif’s return is giving sleepless nights to the government as the ‘bell’ of the government has rung even before the arrival of the former prime minister,” PML-N Punjab President Rana Sanaullah said in response to Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed’s press conference in Karachi. 
Earlier in the day, the interior minister had said that he was ready to issue travel documents to Mr Sharif within 24 hours if he decided to return.  
The minister also offered to pay for PML-N supremo’s air travel. 
Nawaz Sharif, who was serving a seven-year jail term in a corruption case, left the country over two years ago (November 2019) to avail treatment in London on a special four-week court permission. 
The other day PML-N leader and former National Assembly speaker Ayaz Sadiq said he was going to London to bring Mr Sharif back. 
Rana Sanaullah said those who brought in a tsunami of ‘incompetence’, ‘ineptness’ and ‘corruption’ were now crying at the news of Nawaz Sharif’s return. 
He said Sheikh Rashid’s statement in fact exposed fear in the government ranks as people were anxiously waiting for Mr Sharif to come back. 
“When [ex-] prime minister Nawaz Sharif comes home, Niazi and the hired spokespersons will find no place to hide themselves,” Mr Sanaullah said, adding that a bewildered Imran Niazi had abolished PTI’s constitution and the party was now extinct in legal terms. 
Referring to Sheikh Rashid Ahmed’s air ticket offer, the PML-N Punjab president said those whose tickets had been issued by people should take care of themselves instead of making offers to others.

1,Minister blames mafia for govt’s ‘failure’ to fulfil promises,Terms success of JUI-F in KP polls a fallout of Taliban takeover of Kabul; rules out possibility of talks with MQM founder,"KARACHI: Admitting Prime Minister Imran Khan’s “failure” to bring the corrupt elite, hoarders and money launderers to justice despite all the promises he made before the 2018 general elections, Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed has blamed the “deep-rooted and strong mafia” for the current situation, but said the government led by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) “is going nowhere”. 
During a brief press conference here on Sunday, the federal minister shared sketchy details of issues ranging from probable impact of local bodies elections in different provinces to emerging national political scenario amid talk of possible return to the country of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif. 
What came as a direct, blunt and strong-worded comment from him was his act of expressing “concerns” about the government’s performance in a few crucial areas and his admission of helplessness against the “powerful mafia” on behalf of the prime minister. 
“The people voted for us and Imran Khan to catch sugar thieves, flour thieves, corrupt elite, those who have built palaces in London [through ill-gotten money],” he said in response to a question about the government’s performance that was put to him after he had condemned the opposition parties. 

Terms success of JUI-F in KP polls a fallout of Taliban takeover of Kabul; rules out possibility of talks with MQM founder

“The people wanted us to catch and bring them to the court of law for true and quick justice in line with the defined law. But I agree with you, we have failed in this.” 
In response to a similar question put by another reporter, Mr Ahmed came up with a kind of justification for the current state of affairs by giving an impression that the institutions were rather “helpless” before the “much stronger and deep-rooted mafias”. 
“Imran Khan badly wanted to catch those who stole sugar,” he said. “He badly wanted to bring those to court who had eaten up the subsidy. He wanted them in the clutches of law. But you know, the law has its own formalities. And the mafias here are so deep-rooted and powerful, that it couldn’t happen.” 
However, despite publicly admitting the “failures” of the government, the minister was of the opinion that Mr Khan had “nothing to lose” despite reports of “Mr Sharif’s possible return to the country”. 
“If Nawaz Sharif wants to return, I offer him a ticket from my own pocket,” he said. “He’s healthy and fine because he was never ill. How much drama you [Mr Sharif] created to leave the country and if you want to return now, you are more than welcome. 
“While sitting in London, you had no other job but to attack Pakistan’s judiciary and armed forces. So you better come back. It doesn’t make any difference. Imran Khan is standing firm and not going anywhere.” 
Criticising a recent statement of Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif, Mr Ahmad alleged that the former prime minister (Nawaz Sharif) and former president (Asif Ali Zardari) “are the most corrupt leaders of the country”. 
He termed the recent success of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) in the local bodies elections in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa a “fallout of fresh Taliban takeover of Afghanistan”, which had helped the rightwing party to grab the highest number of seats for mayors and chairmen in 39 tehsils of the province. 
“PTI has not secured votes in the recent KP elections, I admit,” he said. “But this is a democracy. It doesn’t reflect anything. But JUI-F has not won due to its growing popularity but it’s a reflection on the Taliban government in Afghanistan. The people on both sides of the border love their religion [Islam]... So these results in fact should be seen this way.” 
The interior minister was quick to rule out any possibility of talks with the London-based founder of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), Altaf Hussain, calling him “the cause of [much] bloodshed and violence in the country”. 
“This is a difficult question,” he said in response to a reporter’s question. “But let me tell you frankly that any dialogue with Altaf Hussain is not possible. The reason is that he had been a key cause of violence and bloodshed in the country. Other leaders of the MQM are like my brothers. I respect them all.”

3,Taliban bar women from long trips without male escort,KABUL: Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities said on Sunday that women seeking to travel long distances should not be...,"KABUL: Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities said on Sunday that women seeking to travel long distances should not be offered road transport unless they are accompanied by a close male relative. 
The guidance issued by the Ministry for the Promo­tion of Virtue and Preven­tion of Vice called on vehicle owners to refuse rides to women not wearing headscarves. 
The move follows the Taliban barring many women in public-sector roles from returning to work in the wake of their August 15 seizure of power, and as girls remain largely cut off from state secondary schooling. 
“Women travelling for more than 45 miles (72 kilometres) should not be offered a ride if they are not accompanied by a close family member,” ministry spok­esman Sadeq Akif Muhajir said on Sunday, specifying that the escort must be a close male relative. 
The new guidance, circulated on social media networks, also asked people to stop playing music in their vehicles. 
Weeks ago, the ministry asked Afghanistan’s television channels to stop showing dramas and soap operas featuring women actors. It also called on women TV journalists to wear headscarves while presenting news reports. 
Muhajir said on Sunday that the hijab, a headscarf, would likewise be required for women seeking transport. 
The Taliban’s interpretation of the hijab — which can range from a hair covering to a face veil or full-body covering — is unclear, and most Afghan women already wear headscarves. 
Human Rights Watch criticised the guidance. “This new order essentially moves... further in the direction of making women prisoners,” Heather Barr, the group’s associate director of women’s rights, said. 
It “shuts off opportunities for them to be able to move about freely, to travel to another city, to do business, (or) to be able to flee if they are facing violence in the home”, Barr added. 
Early this month, the Taliban issued a decree in the name of their supreme leader instructing the government to enforce women’s rights. But it did not mention girls’ access to education. 
Women’s rights were severely curtailed during the Taliban’s previous stint in power in the 1990s. They were forced to wear the face-covering burqa garment, only allowed to leave home with a male chaperone and banned from work and education. 
Respect for women’s rights has repeatedly been cited by key global donors as a condition for restoring aid. 
The UN has warned that Afghanistan faces an “avalanche of hunger” this winter, estimating that 22 million citizens face “acute” food shortages.

4,Flight of dollar continues despite FIA action,FIA Director General Sanaullah Abbasi says foreign currencies worth Rs300m seized this month.,"KARACHI: While the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) is taking all-out measures against illegal currency business, pressure on the exchange rate has refused to ease out as dollar reached a record high of Rs181.3 in the open market on Friday.  
FIA Director General Sanaullah Abbasi told Dawn that during December alone the agency had arrested 158 people and seized local and foreign currencies worth Rs300 million across the country in an effort to stabilise the rupee against the greenback.   
He said the crackdown on those involved in illegal currency business was launched against the backdrop of the fear that dollar was being hoarded and smuggled out of the country.   

DG says foreign currencies worth Rs300m seized this month

He said the FIA acted upon information shared by intelligence agencies, the State Bank of Pakistan and its own field formations.  Asked as to why the dollar was rising against the rupee both in interbank and open markets, he said the agency only dealt with the black market.   
“There are other national and international variables and macro and micro economics which deal with appreciation and depreciation of any currency [and these] are being taken care of by the government, particularly the SBP and the finance ministry,” he replied cautiously.   
Dr Abbasi divides the FIA’s campaign into two phases. According to him, the first phase, from Aug 25 to Nov 30, began soon after the change of regime in Afghanistan. “FIA registered 92 FIRs, conducted 40 inquiries, arrested 107 persons, sealed 21 shops and recovered Rs365m, including foreign currency worth Rs156m.”    
In the second phase, from Dec 1 till date, the FIA registered 117 FIRs, conducted 32 inquiries, arrested 158 persons, sealed nine shops and seized Rs300m, including foreign currency worth Rs88m.   
The FIA chief said the total amount of money seized during this year stood at Rs1.3 billion.   
Over 10,000 transactions scrutinised Dr Abbasi said the federal government had asked the FIA to look into operations of foreign exchange companies.    
“FIA conducted inspection of their sale-purchase record and examined five A category and 29 B category forex companies. More than 10,000 transactions of sale and purchase by these companies were scrutinised. After detecting some irregularities, seven FIRs were registered and 11 inquiries conducted against B category forex firms,” he said.   
During the current year, the FIA scrutinised suspicious transactions in bulk after receiving information about them through the Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs).    
After conducting inquiries in these multilayered complex financial transactions, 156 FIRs were registered since 
Jan 1 to date, he said, adding that 29 STRs were referred to the Federal Board of Revenue, National Accountability Bureau and Anti-Narcotics Force for further proceeding.   
He said the FIA’s action was still going on as contributing to rupee stabilisation was the agency’s top priority.  
‘Govt seems unconcerned’
Zafar Paracha, chairman of the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan, linked seriousness on part of the government with stabilisation of rupee.  
He told Dawn that all indicators of the economy suggested that dollar was overvalued as its exchange rate should be between Rs160-165.   
“Overall, the SBP has taken good measures but their effectiveness has not reflected in the [dollar] rate. We have not seen similar seriousness from the government and it seems as if the government and the SBP are not on the same page,” Mr Paracha said.  
He said the market believed that the government was not taking any interest in controlling the rupee fall because devaluation might be one of the conditions of the International Monetary Fund. “Of course [Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance] Shaukat Tarin has said dollar is overvalued but we haven’t seen a similar statement from any other side.”  
About the FIA’s action, he said: “Exchange companies do not determine the interbank rate. Rate in open market appreciates because of a rise in interbank rate. We are licensed entities doing business in strict compliance with the conditions set by the central bank and it is unfortunate that our members and clients are being called by the FIA.”
