0,"All Mohajir entities should unite for new province, says Afaq","Participants demanded an end to the quota system, fresh and transparent census.","KARACHI: Mohajir Qau­mi Movement leader Afaq Ahmed on Sunday called for a decisive movement for “urban Sindh province” saying that was the only solution to the decades-old issues being faced by the community. He proposed unification of all “pro-Karachi political groups” inviting the Muttahida Qaumi Move­ment-Pakistan (MQM-P) and Pak Sarzameen Party (PSP), besides other Karachi-based political entities, to unite on a single platform to launch the movement. 
Addressing an impressive power show at Bagh-i-Jinnah, next to the Quaid-i-Azam’s mausoleum, his MQM (until recently known as Haqiqi) made its presence felt after years of alienation from political limelight.  
Afaq’s address made the listeners to believe that the party was going to maintain the tempo with aggressive activism across major urban centres of Sindh in the months to come. 
Speaking to an emotionally charged crowd of men, women and children, the MQM chief said he was clear about his ideology, and insisted that those doing politics from different platforms for becoming a national-level organisation had failed as Mohajirs could not get their rights in Sindh. He warned that the people of his community were forced to launch a decisive movement after realising that making demands and holding rallies alone never attracted attention of power corridors. 
Through a resolution the participants demanded an end to the quota system, fresh and transparent census, major share of Mohajir youths in police jobs and a strong local bodies system. After the resolution was adopted, Afaq Ahmed made the final announcement about unification of all Mohajir entities and offered his “apology for the past mistakes.” 
“I appeal to Wasim Akhtar, I appeal to Khalid Maqbool Siddiqi, I appeal to Anis Qaimkhani and I appeal to Amir Khan to forgive me; and let’s unite on a single platform,” he said while the crowd was raising slogans in favour of his announcement. “I also appeal to Mustafa Kamal. We have achieved nothing by shedding the word of Mohajir from our politics. We have not achieved anything. This is the word which gives us strength. This is the word which gives life to our parties when they face elimination. So for the sake of your nation and for the sake of your people, I appeal to you to return to your identity. Join hands so that we can launch a decisive movement for a south Sindh province.” 
Earlier, during his speech he recounted a number of “unjust moves” both from the federal and Sindh governments that isolated the Mohajir community and left them with inferiority complex. The most educated and respected community of the country, he said, was deprived and exploited only on ethnic grounds. 
“But we are loyal to this country and do not like [Chief Minister] Murad Ali Shah,” he said referring to the recent speech by the CM on the floor of the Sindh Assembly accusing the opposition of “trying to create a rural-urban ethnic divide”. An angry CM had asked the opposition: “Do you want people from Islamabad to occupy Sindh? The people of Sindh will never allow such an occupation. Yes, we are part of Pakistan and we should be considered part of the country. Don’t create a situation that could lead people to start thinking about something different. You are in minority and will remain in minority, and you will never be able to take decisions”.

1,Opposition’s campaign against local govt law picks up momentum,PSP demands restoration of 2001 law; JI to stage sit-in at PA on 31st; MWM to host MPC on Wednesday.,"KARACHI: The ongoing protest campaign by the opposition parties in the province against the recently enacted Sindh Local Government Act 2021 continued on Sunday with the Pak Sarzameen Party and Jamaat-i-Islami holding their separate demonstrations while the Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen announced a multiparty conference (MPC) scheduled to be held on Wednesday. 
Only on Saturday, opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan and Grand Democratic Alliance had formed a three-party steering committee to fight PPP’s new LG law and announced their first meeting for Monday (today). 
The Sindh Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2021 has already become a law despite the fact that the governor had refused to give his assent to it. 

PSP demands restoration of 2001 law; JI to stage sit-in at PA on 31st; MWM to host MPC on Wednesday 

All the opposition parties have already rejected the legislation terming it a ‘black law’ and geared up against it in a bid to pressure the ruling PPP to reverse it. 
PSP protest at Hasan Square
Amid ‘Go Zardari Go’ slogan, PSP chairman Syed Mustafa Kamal on Sunday announced launching what he called a decisive movement from Jan 2 against the LG law. 
The party staged a big protest demonstration near Hasan Square in city’s district East as part of its ongoing protest against the new LG law. Senior leadership of the party, including its president Anis Kaimkhani, was also present. 
A number of party activists, including women and children, were carrying banners, party flags and shouting slogans against the PPP leadership and rejecting what they called the ‘black law’. 
Speaking on the occasion, Mr Kamal said that his party would stage a protest outside the Chief Minister House. “We will not let PPP disintegrate remaining Pakistan...we will not allow a new East Pakistan,” he said. 
He said that the rulers had to delegate powers to the grassroots level otherwise the city would witness ethnic riots over the control of one waterline. 
Taking a dig at MQM-P, he claimed that “the champions of giving strikes call” had not staged a single protest against “snatching” of powers and resources by the PPP. 
He said that in the presence of PSP no party could pit Mohajirs, Sindhis and Punjabis against each other. “People of this city will never fight on linguistic basis,” he said. 
Mr Kamal demanded withdrawal of the LG law of 2021 and restoration of the 2001 law with more powers and resources so that people from Karachi to Kashmore felt empowered.  
JI demo in North Karachi
A number of JI workers and supporters gathered in a North Karachi locality near Power House to register their protest against the enactment of LG law. 
Carrying placards and banners, the protesters chanted slogans against the PPP government saying that the ruling party bulldozed “a black law” in the assembly. 
Speaking to the protesters, JI city chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman said that his party would stage a sit-in outside the Sindh Assembly building on Dec 31. 
He hoped that the Sindh government would have no option but to withdraw ‘the black law’ that was aimed at squeezing the administrative and financial authorities of local governments in the province. 
He said that the law had exposed the people who believed in feudalism and were intended to impose their agenda across the province.  
He remarked that feudal lords got a majority in the Sindh Assembly by suppressing the masses. 
He said that the government was trying to put Sindhi- and Urdu-speaking communities against each other in Karachi, but the JI would not only foil the conspiracy but also expose those who were promoting ethnic politics. 
“Some political parties in the city are opposing the black law only in drawing rooms,” he said, holding the MQM-P and PTI responsible for the miseries of Karachi. 
MWM’s MPC on 29th
The Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen, expressing its concern over the new LG law on Sunday, demanded that the government review the legislation. 
Speaking at a press conference, MWM leader Syed Ali Hussain Naqvi said that the government should take into consideration the concern expressed by almost all stakeholders on the bill. 
He said keeping in view the situation, his party had decided to convene an MPC on Dec 29.  
He said that all political parties of Karachi and rest of Sindh would be invited to the moot in which a future course of action would be decided after consultations.

2,Mass Covid-19 vaccination centres in Sindh to go round-the-clock from next year,"The first dose coverage for Covid-19 vaccine has increased from 45pc to 55pc in the province, say officials,","KARACHI: The Covid-19 vaccination coverage in Sindh has received a major boost due to an outreach programme launched this month across the province, health department officials told Dawn.
They said that once the door-to-door drive for Covid-19 vaccination was over by Dec 31, all the mass vaccination centres in the province would resume their round-the-clock timings from the next year.
According to the officials, the first dose coverage for Covid-19 vaccine has increased from 45pc (before the launch of outreach programme) to 55pc in the province; whereas that of double dose from 30pc to 40pc.
“We have received a very positive response from the public despite the fact that there was an anti-polio drive going on during the same time,” said Dr Samreen Ashraf Qureshi, the focal person for Covid-19 vaccination.
The health department had engaged a significant number of healthcare workers for the door-to-door outreach programme, which also led to reduce timings of the Covid-19 mass vaccination centres this month, which were earlier being run round the clock.
“Hopefully, the drive will end by Dec 31 and the mass vaccination centres will resume their old timings. Right now, these units are open the whole week from 8am till 8pm,” she said.
Currently, 12 mass vaccination centres are operating in the province including units at the Expo Centre, Khaliqdina Hall, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre and Dow University of Health Sciences in Karachi.
A Covid-19 booster drive is also in progress in the province under which so far 125,000 people have received the dose. 
In the first phase, booster doses were offered to front-line health workers, persons with weak immune systems and people aged above 50 years, who were fully vaccinated against the coronavirus six months ago.

5,"Culture dept officials, builder booked for forging heritage property’s record",FIA has conducted probe on SC order into sale of Dharamshala in Napier,"KARACHI: The Federal Inve­stigation Agency (FIA) has booked some senior officials of the Sindh cultural department and other suspects for cheating and forging property documents leading to the sale and subsequent demolition of a decades-old Hindu property on Napier Road.
A statement issued by the Sindh zone of the agency said that a case was registered against culture department officials Fauzia Mursaleen, Mir Nosh Khan, Ejaz Ahmed Rind, two tenants of the building Iqbal Swati and Abdul Rahman, builder Danish Yousuf and others.
They were booked under Sections 109 (abetment), 420 (Cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 468 (Forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (Using as genuine a forged document) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
“The case was registered in line with the orders of the Supreme Court, which had issued directives in a case pertaining to demolition of Dharmshala in Napier,” an FIA statement said. 

FIA has conducted probe on SC order into sale of Dharamshala in Napier

“In an inquiry conducted by the FIA it was found that the building was sold with a fake NOC [no objection certificate] in connivance with Sindh cultural department officers and staff members. The process was also facilitated by two individuals who were living in the building as tenants. The role of Evacuee Property Trust Board [EPTB] and its officials in this scam is also being closely scrutinised,” it added.
On a complaint filed by Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani, the Supreme Court had last month asked the EPTB chairman to appear personally and explain the alleged sale of a Hindu property called Dharmshala. 
Dr Vankwani is the patron of the Pakistan Hindu Council (PHC). He claimed that an inquiry had found that the ETPB had forged documents to prove that the Sindh heritage department issued a no-objection certificate for the demolition of the Dharamshala — a shelter for Hindu pilgrims. The piece of land, spread over 716 square yards, was then handed over to a builder for construction of a shopping centre. On June 11, the Supreme Court had ordered the Sindh government and the ETPB not to demolish any part of the Dharamshala.
The apex court had directed the Karachi commissioner to take over the building so that no person trespassed upon the premises. 
In his application, Dr Vankwani requested the apex court to transfer the control of the premises to the management of the nearby Baghani Temple. 
He called for an inquiry by the FIA into the alleged forging of documents and demolition of the heritage property by the ETPB.

Ex-SHO Orangi Town police station Inspector Azam Gopang along with constable Toheed and a private person Umair have been booked for allegedly killing Arsalan Mehsud and wounding his friend Yasir near Qatar Hospital on Dec 7. 
The investigating officer produced the held constable and private man before the administrative judge of the ATCs on expiry of their physical remand in police custody and requested for an extension in the same. 
However, the judge remanded them in judicial custody and directed the IO to produce them on Jan 3. The IO was further told to submit an investigation report on the next date. 
Ex-SHO Gopang is already in judicial custody in the present case. 
Initially, the police claimed that the victim, who was returning from a tuition centre in Nazimabad, was a criminal. But after widespread condemnation on social media and protests by relatives and community members, it emerged that the encounter was fake. 
Later, the constable and his civilian friend were arrested and a case was registered against them.

First of all, Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah’s 95th birthday...","IT was a significant week in more ways than one. First of all, Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah’s 95th birthday anniversary fell in it, and programmes were held in the city to highlight the achievements of our great leader.  
For example, on Dec 25, 1971, Begum Rana Liaquat Ali Khan called upon the nation to obey faithfully and honestly the call of President Z A Bhutto for faith, unity and discipline because that alone should be the nation’s best and truest tribute to Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah. She made the appeal in her presidential address delivered at a meeting arranged at Theosophical Hall under the auspices of the Pakistan Council for Public Affairs to celebrate the 95th birthday of the Quaid. Lamenting that the motto of faith, unity and discipline was often “so glibly quoted by us and then so smugly stored away for future verbal use”, she stressed what was needed at that critical juncture of the country’s history was that we follow the principles to the letter and spirit and not for “mere verbal persiflage”. 
It was indeed a critical juncture due to the debilitating war that had taken its toll on citizens. But the unmatched resilient and magnanimous spirit of the Pakistani nation was there to be witnessed. On Jan 1, 1972 it was reported that the Kashana-i-Atfal-o-Naunihal was under a virtual siege by women who wanted to adopt the war orphans. They had begun visiting the place after reading in newspapers that the All Pakistan Women’s Association (APWA) would arrange placements of the children at the above-mentioned orphanages. Women moved by noble intention flocked to the Kashana every day. But there were no babies available for adoption.     
Then there were other effects of the war that had an international involvement. On Dec 8, a British ship S S Harmattan was hit by Indian missiles in the outer anchorage of Karachi in which seven members of its crew got killed and six received injuries. On Dec 30, it was announced that S S Harmattan had been salvaged by the Karachi Port Trust (KPT). The operation was undertaken under the Lloyd Open Form that was on a no-cure-no-pay basis. Much of the fertiliser imported from Poland for Karachi transshipment to Chittagong had been damaged because water had entered the vessel through the gaping holes caused by the missile attack. 
Not just that, with respect to city affairs, too, things seemed quite unsettling. On Dec 30, about 1,500 prisoners at Karachi’s Central Prison went on a peaceful, indefinite strike.  Their demands included remission in sentences, disposal of pending  cases, full remission of sentences of those involved in murder cases and  jail reform. K Idris, Deputy Commission of the city, visited the jail  and tried to pacify the prisoners; he did not succeed. They, however,  assured him that they would not resort to violence. The strikers also  demanded that their grievances be known to the Governor of Sindh, Mumtaz  Bhutto, and requested him to visit them. The deputy commissioner  afterwards apprised the governor of the situation. The police had taken  adequate measures to deal with any emergency. The prisoners raised a  slogan when the deputy commissioner was at the prison saying [if] “you  have let off traitors” then why they couldn’t be released.

10,Single national curriculum termed ‘return to One Unit’,HYDERABAD: Education experts speaking at the concluding session day of the 7th Ayaz Melo were highly critical of the...,"HYDERABAD: Education experts speaking at the concluding session day of the 7th Ayaz Melo were highly critical of the single national curriculum (SNC) planned by the federal government, saying that its implementation would be tantamount to introducing syllabus-based ‘One Unit’.  
A teacher of Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), Dr Taimur Rahman, while participating in a discussion on syllabus late on Saturday night said that the federal government had promised to reform education and health sectors, but it failed to fulfil its promise.  
He said Pakistani education system was completely class-based that needed to be changed.  The session was moderated by Zakia Aijaz. Dr Rahman told Zakia Aijaz that Pakistan had 25 million out-of-school children.  
“On one hand there are seminaries and on the other private institutions that teach their syllabus,” he said.  
“When the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government could not change the system, it changed the syllabus.”  
Education was a provincial subject after the 18th amendment, he said.  
He said he saw books of the SNC; they were of poor quality and appeared to be published in haste with lot of mistakes.  
Prof Nazir Mahmood said the federal government’s decision to ‘thrust’ its syllabus over the province after 18th amendment was unconstitutional.  
Sindh refused to implement the SNC. ‘Wahdaniyat’ (oneness) could not be imposed in education and imposing the SNC on children was tantamount to imposing the federal government’s will.  
He equated implementing the SNC with rebirth of One Unit.  
He said schools were being converted into seminaries in Punjab. This government wanted to employ one million religious minded people. Rulers were mistaken if they thought the SNC would settle everything. He asked why real heroes had disappeared from syllabus? People needed those heroes who talked about democracy and people.  
Prof Riaz Sheikh of Szabist said that the PTI government was just a pawn insofar as implementation of the SNC was concerned.  
“Sindh has included not only Malala Yusufzai but Dr Abdul Salam in its syllabus besides Adeebul Hassan Rizvi and Comrade Hyder Bux Jatoi. Mai Bakhtawar will become part of its syllabus too.”  
“Unless religion and politics are separated, educational system will not improve,” he said. If the SNC was imposed, it would lead to Syria like conditions.  
Prof Abdul Majeed Chandio said the federal government wanted to produce ‘good Taliban’ through the SNC. 
He said Sindhi language had its own alphabets thus this province was more sensitive. Retired generals and religious minded people were included in the SNC preparations and it would divide people, he claimed.  
Prof Dr Arfana Mallah said no heroic role of women was included in syllabus. 
Writer Jamil Ahmed said culture was born among artisans, peasants and lower middle class. Language of idioms was found in villages and among villagers.  
If one wanted to learn language, he should wander among villagers.  
Hindi language was daughter of Sindhi language. Inclusion of Persian words in Urdu had damaged Urdu.

A 60-foot-wide main stage has been decorated with tri-colour party flags, banners and life-size portraits of former prime minister Ms Bhutto and other central leaders of the party.  
Foolproof security along with extensive traffic arrangements has been ensured. According to security sources, 30 police officers of SSP level and 80 DSPs along with women police force would be deployed on the day.  
Some 150 CCTV cameras have been installed and 70 walkthrough gates installed at the entry points of the venue. 
A control room has been established at the main venue to monitor the public meeting which the party sources said would be addressed by PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and other key leaders. 

Bilawal, other key leaders to address participants at Bhuttos’ mausoleum

Mr Bhutto-Zardari along with Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali on Sunday arrived at Naudero. 
The party workers and admirers of the Bhutto family had started pouring in from different corners of the country.  
Yaad-i-Benazir conference
Homage was paid to the slain PPP chairperson at a programme titled ‘Yaad-i-Benazir Conference’ held under the auspices of the party’s youth wing at the Sir Shahnawaz Bhutto Memorial Library. 
Speakers said that the Oct 18 (Karsaz) and Dec 27 (Benazir’s assassination) tragedies were part of a single conspiracy, and demanded inclusion of the names of then Pakistan president Gen Pervez Musharraf and Sindh Chief Minister Dr Arbab Ghulam Rahim in the investigation. 
Presiding over the conference, Sindh PPP president Nisar Khuhro said that in order to gag the voice of people and snatch their right to rule, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was implicated in a false case and hanged. His daughter Benazir Bhutto was also assassinated to achieve the same objective, he said. 
Bilawal’s political secretary Jamil Soomro, Khuhro’s spokesman Shakeel Memon, Sohrab Marri, Javed Nayab Leghari, Imran Jatoi, leaders of youth wing and others also spoke at the conference.  
Book on Benazir assassination launched
On the eve of the 14th death anniversary of Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, a book authored by former interior minister and senior PPP leader Senator A. Rehman Malik was launched in Islamabad on Sunday, adds Amir Wasim from the capital.  
Titled The Assassination of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, the book reveals the conspiracy and facts behind the high-profile murder. 
Published in English and Urdu, the book consists of 28 chapters carrying details of characters involved in the Liaquat Bagh, Rawalpindi, incident. It is available to people for free. 
Speaking on the occasion, the writer said false impressions were given that the PPP government during its tenure [after Benazir’s assassination] had failed to investigate the case. All those involved in the murder of Ms Bhutto were identified, arrested, put on trial and even convicted, except for those who were killed in mysterious circumstances or absconded. 
The arrested ones had been enlarged on bail, he regretted.  
Published with the curtsey of the Institute of Research and Reforms (IRR), the book is dedicated to the Bhutto family and martyrs of the PPP.

Speaking at a joint news conference at local hotel, Isra University vice chancellor Prof Dr Nazir Ashraf Leghari, former eye hospital head Prof Dr Shafi Jatoi and others said that SIOVS should be immediately re-affiliated with Lumhs to continue undergraduate and postgraduate programmes for students.
Isra University vice chancellor Prof Dr Nazir Ashraf Leghari said, “All of us urge Sindh chief minister and health minister, who are working wholeheartedly for Sindh’s health sector, to place SIOVS under LUMHS administration as it was its syndicate’s approved institute, so that faculty should also serve there besides Liaquat University Hospital’s staff.”
He added that SIOVS should be re-affiliated with LUMHS in the larger interest of students and patients.
They also appreciated Sindh High Court’s decision to de-notify SIOVS incumbent executive director Prof Dr Khalid Iqbal Talpur.
Dr Nazir Ashraf Leghari claimed that SIOVS got Rs500m grant from Sindh government which was disbursed by Prof Khalid Iqbal Talpur single-handedly.
He said that Prof Talpur misguided the government to get funds which resultantly collapsed other eye hospitals due to lack of funding. He added that provision of eye healthcare facilities in the province was declining.
He requested relevant anti-corruption watchdogs, including FIA, FBR, anti-corruption and NAB, to look into current and past assets of Dr Khalid Talpur. He also called for forensic audit from big four auditors of Pakistan into SIOVS’s funding.
Prof Dr Khan Mohammad Nangrejo said 32 faculty members of LUMHS were performing their duties, but a single individual was getting all perks and privileges which was height of injustice.
Dr Leghari said all these ophthalmologists did not want that the institute’s status should be compromised. He said it should be run by credible and professional faculty members of internationally recognised varsity, LUMHS.

The meeting chaired by SAI president Nawab Zubair Talpur noted that di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) fertiliser’s international price was Rs5,500 per bag, but was being sold at Rs10,000. Similarly, urea’s bag was being sold for Rs3,000 against notified price of Rs1,768.
SAI said that wheat crop needed urea with first cycle of water, and if not provided, it’s growth was effected. It claimed that DAP was being hoarded to inflate cost, and artificial shortage was created to exploit farmers.
SAI observed that only 20 per cent farmers had access to urea fertiliser and small growers were not able to use it. It said that at least three to four bags of urea were required to achieve better grain formation. 
SAI said that federal minister, industries and productions had said that this year 31mn ton urea was produced against last year’s production of 30m tons. 
SAI alleged that fertiliser manufacturing factories, dealers and agriculture department deprived farmers of billions of rupees by deliberately initiating this crisis. It expressed concern over non-provision of first cycle of wheat crop to the areas of Badin, Thatta and Sujawal.
The meeting asserted that Sindh government provided uninterrupted gas supply to fertiliser manufacturing units, yet remained silent over shortage of fertiliser.
The meeting warned consumers of wheat crisis and said that flour could be sold for Rs100 due to compromised production.It demanded the government to sell urea bag for same price as Punjab’s. 
SAI urged prime minister to hold an inquiry on the matter and to take action against the responsible. It also appealed to chief justice of Pakistan and chief justice Sindh High Court to take action against hoarders and profiteers, and requested National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to take notice of ‘corruption’.
