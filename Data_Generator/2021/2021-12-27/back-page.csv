0,Israel approves plan to double settler population in Golan,Syria describes Israeli annexation of the territory as a violation of its sovereignty,"GOLAN HEIGHTS: Israel’s government on Sunday approved a $317 million plan to double the Jewish settler population in the Golan Heights, 40 years after it annexed the territory captured from Syria. 
Prime Minister Naftali Bennett’s cabinet voted in favour of the plan that aims to build 7,300 settler homes in the region over a five-year period, during a meeting held at the Mevo Hama community in the Golan. 
It calls for 1 billion Israeli shekels to be spent on housing, infrastructure and other projects with the goal of attracting roughly 23,000 new Jewish settlers to the area, seized during the 1967 Six Day War. 
“Our goal today is to double the population of the Golan Heights,” the right-wing Bennett said ahead of the meeting. 
He was forced to leave the meeting after his 14-year-old daughter tested positive for the coronavirus, putting him into isolation, but a vote on the programme went ahead after a delay. 

Syria describes Israeli annexation of the territory as a violation of its sovereignty

Around 25,000 Israeli settlers live in the Golan Heights, along with about 23,000 Druze, who remained on the land after Israel seized it. 
Israel annexed the territory on December 14, 1981, in a move not recognised by most of the international community. 
Former US president Donald Trump, widely viewed as pro-Israeli, granted US recognition to Israeli sovereignty over the Golan in 2019. 
“The Golan Heights are Israeli. This is self-evident,” Bennett said. 
“The fact that the Trump administration recognised this, and the fact that the (President Joe) Biden administration has made it clear that there has been no change in this policy, are also important.” 
Shortly after Biden took office in January, his Secretary of State Antony Blinken suggested there were legal questions surrounding Trump’s move, which Syria condemned as a “flagrant violation” of its sovereignty. 
But Blinken indicated there was no thought of reversing course, especially with the Syrian civil war continuing. 
Bennett claimed that after a decade of conflict in Syria, international calls to restore Syrian control of the Golan were muted. 
“Every knowledgeable person in the world understands that it is preferable to have Israeli heights that are quiet, flourishing and green as opposed to the alternative,” he said. 
Bennett leads an ideologically disparate eight-party coalition that counts on support from left-wingers. 
Some in his cabinet, notably from the dovish Meretz party, have vocally opposed plans to expand settlements in the West Bank, a Palestinian territory also occupied by Israel since 1967. 
Roughly 475,000 settlers now live in the West Bank in communities widely regarded as illegal under international law. 
Bennett is a former head of a settler lobbying council that opposes Palestinian statehood. 
But he argued that unity on the Golan plan demonstrated that Israeli control of the area was a matter of “national consensus.”  
“The Golan Heights, the need to strengthen, cultivate and live in it, is certainly a principle that unites everyone here,” he said. 
Israel and Syria, which are still technically at war, are separated by a de facto border at the Golan Heights.

1,Charity says staff missing after Myanmar massacre,Save the Children says it is suspending operations in the region.,"BANGKOK: The international aid group Save the Children said two of its staffers were missing in a massacre in eastern Myanmar that left more than 30 people, including women and children, dead and burned in their vehicles after they were reportedly shot by government troops as they were fleeing combat.
Photos of the aftermath of the Christmas Eve killings in Mo So village, just outside Hpruso township in Kayah state, spread on social media, fuelling outrage against the military that took power in February after ousting the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi.
The US Embassy in Mya­nmar said it was appalled by the barbaric attack in Kayah state that killed at least 35 civilians, including women and children.
“We will continue to press for accountability for the perpetrators of the ongoing campaign of violence against the people of Burma,” it said in a statement. Save the Children said it was suspending operations in the region.
A villager who said he went to the scene said that the victims had fled the fighting between armed resistance groups and Myanmar’s army near Koi Ngan village, which is just beside Mo So, on Friday. 
He said they were killed after they were arrested by troops while heading to refugee camps in the western part of the township.
Save the Children said that two of its staff who were travelling home for the holidays after conducting humanitarian response work in a nearby community were caught up in the incident and remain missing.

2,Anti-apartheid icon Desmond Tutu dies at 90,Imran pays tribute to the Nobel laureate,"JOHANNESBURG: South African anti-apartheid icon Archbishop Desmond Tutu, described as the country’s moral compass, died on Sunday aged 90, sparking an outpouring of tributes for the outspoken Nobel peace laureate. 
Tutu, who had largely faded from public life in recent years, was remembered for his easy humour and characteristic smile — and above all his tireless fight against injustices of all colours. 
South Africa’s President Cyril Rama­phosa, announcing the archbishop’s death on Sunday, called him a man of “extraordinary intellect, integrity and invincibility against the forces of apartheid”. 
“The passing of Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu is another chapter of bereavement in our nation’s farewell to a generation of outstanding South Africans who have bequeathed us a liberated South Africa,” he said, weeks after the death of FW de Klerk, the country’s last white president. 
Former US president Barack Obama, the country’s first Black leader, hailed Tutu as a towering figure and “moral compass”. 

Imran pays tribute to the Nobel laureate

“A universal spirit, Archbishop Tutu was grounded in the struggle for liberation and justice in his own country, but also concerned with injustice everywhere,” Obama said in a statement. 
Mourners gathered at his former parish in Cape Town, St George’s Cathedral, while others massed at his home, some holding flower bouquets, according to a journalist. 
“If it was not for him, probably we would have been lost as a country,” said Miriam Mokwadi, a 67-year-old retired nurse, outside the cathedral. 
The South African cricket team wore black armbands in his honour on the first day of the first Test against India in South Africa. 
A tireless activist, Tutu won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for combating white minority rule in his country. He coined the term “Rainbow Nation” to describe South Africa when Nelson Mandela became the country’s first black president in 1994. 
And Tutu retired in 1996 to lead a harrowing journey into South Africa’s brutal past as head of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which lifted the lid on the horrors of the apartheid regime. 
However, Tutu also criticised the ruling African National Congress (ANC) — the vanguard of the fight against white-minority rule. He challenged Mandela over generous salaries for cabinet ministers and stridently criticised the corruption that mushroomed under ex-president Jacob Zuma.
Imran’s tribute
Like many world leaders, Prime Minister Imran Khan expressed condolences on the death of Archbishop Tutu. 
Posting a message on Twitter, Mr Khan wrote: “My deepest condolences on the passing of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Nobel Laureate, close confidant of Nelson Mandela, an icon of anti-apartheid struggle & champion of human rights.” 
“His critical role in liberation & national reconciliation is an inspiration for future generations,” he added.
