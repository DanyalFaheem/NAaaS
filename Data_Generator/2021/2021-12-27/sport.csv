0,"Haider, Huraira give Northern hope of first-innings lead",Northern reached 184-3 against defending champions Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at stumps on second day of the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy final.,"KARACHI: Still 190 runs behind their opponents. But, still, well-placed to get a first-innings lead.
Thanks largely to their openers Haider Ali and Mohammad Huraira, Northern reached 184-3 against defending champions Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at stumps on the second day of the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy final on Sunday.
Having bowled out Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for 374, both Haider and Huraira hit half-centuries as they shared an brisk opening stand of a 100 runs in the day/night pink-ball final at the National Stadium.
Pakistan international spinner Sajid Khan sent them both the pavilion before Sameen Gul got rid of Northern captain Umar Amin with Sarmad Bhatti (39 not out) and Farhan Riaz (one not out) still at the crease.
Huraira, fresh from making a triple century in the last round-robin encounter, showed he was a batter in top form.
He hit seven fours and a stright six over long-on in a 65-ball 51 before Sajid got him lbw with a delivery that turned sharply and had him on the backfoot. He walked off, showing his bat to the umpire and suggesting that he may have touched the ball.
Haider too is a batter in form, racking up runs in Pakistan’s recent Twenty20 series against the West Indies at the National Stadium.
He cracked 14 boundaries in his 81 and was dismissed attempting another hit to the fence. Trying to hit Sajid out of the park, he could only find Sameen at long-on.
Northern were then 163-2 and it was 180-3 when Sameen had Umar caught at first slip. 
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, who shared the trophy last season with Central Punjab after their final had ended in a draw, tried for another breakthrough but Farhan and Sarmad stood firm even if they combined for just four runs in almost eight overs.
Earlier, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa managed to add another 122 runs to their total thanks to Asif Afridi’s 68 after resuming on their overnight score of 252-5.
Rehan Afridi could only add eight runs to his overnight score before he departed for 31, edging a Kashif Ali delivery to wicket-keeper Rohail Nazir, but Asif was joined by Sajid and they added 39 runs with the latter contributing a run-a-ball 22.
Sajid hit a six and a boundary before being out lbw on Mohammad Nawaz’s armball that hit his backpad.
Asif and Mohammad Wasim Jr (21) then added another 63 runs to frustrate Northern bowlers but the former perished after hitting a six and six boundaries when he holed a Mubasir Khan delivery to Nawaz at mid-on.
Mubasir then wrapped up the tail when he dismissed Wasim and Imran Khan off successive deliveries.
Wasim went for a sweep against the spinner but missed the ball completely and was out lbw before Imran top-edged a similar delivery while playing a similar shot to mid-on.
Mubasir was the pick of the bowlers with 4-52 while pacer Waqas Ahmed got 3-94.

Heading into the teeth of brisk southerly winds, LawConnect grabbed the front position from rival 30-metre (100-foot) super maxi SHK Scallywag from Hong Kong, which hit a major technical problem with a jib sail fitting after having led the fleet out of Sydney Harbour. 
Some four hours after the race started, LawConnect was in first position ahead of another super maxi, Black Jack. 
SHK Scallywag, which had to hoist a less powerful storm jib while the crew tried to effect repairs with waves crashing over them, lay in third place. 
The 628 nautical-mile (1,170km) race in the Tasman Sea from Sydney and across Bass Strait to Hobart is one of the world’s most gruelling yachting events. It was cancelled in 2020 at the last minute due to health restrictions. 
The 26th edition started under blue skies, but the fleet are expected to face tough conditions due to strong winds as they make their way to the capital of the island state of Tasmania. 
The yachts are expected to reach the finish line on Tuesday, but weather could be the deciding factor. A major storm sank five boats, killing six sailors, in the 1998 race. 
The sailors faced strict health protocols due to the pandemic with mandatory Covid-19 vaccination and PCR tests before the start. 
The fleet was reduced to 88 boats with five yachts withdrawing over the last 24 hours due to the virus and injuries affecting the crew. 
Skippers have been told boats must immediately retire from the race if a crew member receives a message from health authorities saying they have tested positive for Covid-19.

The meeting scheduled for Sunday was postponed to Monday to facilitate the Race connoisseurs to see the Quaid-e-Azam Gold Cup, the premier race at the down country racing centre Karachi, held on Saturday. 
Exactly a half-dozen three-year-old colts and fillies, a cream of the top bloodlines bred at different stud farm in the country are taking part in the country to measure their strides  exhibiting stamina, speed and staying ability to wear the rob of champion three-year-old over 1600 metres distance.

5,"For Karachi’s basketball players, the future doesn’t hold much hope",Pakistan remains unranked among 213 members of global basketball body FIBA.,"KARACHI: They idolise NBA players, well and truly knowing that reaching that level would be beyond them. Even beyond the future generations of basketball players raised in Karachi. 
But they continue to play and during the 16th edition of the weeklong Quaid-e-Azam Gold Cup here at the Aram Bagh Court, there was a flurry of action with as many as 148 players across all age groups involved. 
Among those were players like the 16-year-old Yash Harwani and 14-year-old Mohammad Hasan Ali. For their youthful exuberances the harsh realities of the state of basketball in the country don’t matter. At least, for now. 
“I’m a big fan of [four-time NBA champion] LeBron James and I want to be like him one day,” Yash, who’s being touted as a future prospect for Pakistan basketball, told Dawn during the sidelines of the tournament. “Playing at the highest level is possible and you just have to show willingness to achieve that.” 
Hasan, who caught the eye during the tournament with his three-point shooting, echoes similar views. 
“Stephen Curry is my favourite player and I’ve modeled my game on his,” he said about the three-time NBA winner. 
For both Yash and Hasan, tournaments like the Quaid-e-Azam Gold Cup are an opportunity “to get better and learn new things”. 
But are they a pathway to a professional basketball career? 
“There aren’t any facilities to groom top players,” Kenneth Johnson, who’s played for Sindh at the National Games, told Dawn. “It’s far easier to become a minister in Pakistan than a NBA player.” 
Askari Alpha captain Shahmeer Zaheer, whose side beat Omega in the final on Saturday, agrees. 
“The biggest requirement in basketball is facilities,” he told Dawn. “You need a proper hoop, a smooth surface to play and they are rare to find in Pakistan.” 
That somewhat resonates with Pakistan’s standing in international basketball. 
Pakistan remains unranked among 213 members of global basketball body FIBA. Despite having won three silver medals at the South Asian Games and a silver at the South Asian Basketball Association Championship in 2013, it did not enter the qualifying for the 2021 FIBA Asia Cup, which was rescheduled to next year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
Syed Adnan Ali played basketball for 21 years and is now a referee at the Pakistan Basketball Federation. He believes the PBF is doing little to enhance Pakistan’s standing. 
“The sponsors aren’t attracted to the sport because it isn’t being promoted enough by the PBF,” Adnan, who is the coach of the Nixor College basketball team, told Dawn. “There isn’t any support for those who want to play.” 
As far as the Karachi Basketball Association is concerned, it says it’s doing its part in promoting the game and providing facilities to play.  
“We are doing everything we can which is in our capacity, we have no funding yet we have some of the modern technologies here,” KBBA president Ghulam Mohammad Khan, who is also a PBF vice-president, told Dawn. “We renovated the Aram Bagh court and made it an international level court, installed LED flood lights, baskets and a digital clock.” 
He informed that Karachi would hold the PBF Inter-provincial Tournament in March but added that there should be more such events so players across the country can pit themselves against each other. 
But like many other organisers of sport in the country, in the end, he questioned the players’ motivation.
“Basketball is mostly being played by the elite class of the society for recreational purposes,” he said. “They don’t participate in trials because they don’t want travel out of Karachi. Then, of course, there isn’t much money involved in the sport so the motivation dies.” 
That, though, doesn’t hold true in the case of Yash or Hasan. They want to achieve more but the future doesn’t hold much hope.

8,"Six of the best for City as Arsenal, Spurs cruise",Leicester City were blown away by four goals inside 25 minutes by Manchester City.,"LONDON: Manchester City opened up a six-point lead at the top of the Premier League with a first half demolition of Leicester City in a thrilling 6-3 win as Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur were also comfortable winners on Sunday.
Three of the scheduled nine Boxing Day matches were postponed due to coronavirus outbreaks as Britain battles record numbers of cases caused by the Omicron strain of the virus.
Earlier this week, Premier League clubs rejected the option of temporarily halting the season to allow a circuit breaker for infections.
And a stop to the season may be the only way to slow City’s charge towards a fourth title in five seasons as Pep Guardiola’s men have now won nine league games in a row.
Leicester were blown away by four goals inside 25 minutes.
Kevin De Bruyne blasted home to open the floodgates before Riyad Mahrez netted against his former club from the penalty spot.
Ilkay Gundogan rounded off a brilliant City team move to make it 3-0 before Raheem Sterling won and converted the champions’ second penalty.
Leicester are one of the sides to have been decimated by Covid infections and injuries in recent weeks, but they produced a stirring second half fightback thanks to James Maddison.
The midfielder pulled a goal back before leading a break finished off by Ademola Lookman.
Kelechi Iheanacho made it 4-3 when he bundled home from close range after Ederson could only turn Maddison’s shot onto the bar.
But City quickly restored some order as Aymeric Laporte powered home from a corner and Sterling rounded off the scoring from close range.
Arsenal consolidated their position in fourth with a routine 5-0 win at rock bottom Norwich City.
Goals from Bukayo Saka and Kieran Tierney put the result beyond much doubt before half-time.
Saka added a second before Alexandre Lacazette’s penalty and substitute Emile Smith Rowe rounded off a fifth consecutive win for Mikel Arteta’s men.
Spurs moved up to fifth, six points behind their north London rivals but with three games in hand, after easing past a depleted Crystal Palace.
Palace’s request for the game to be postponed was dismissed by the Premier League despite a coronavirus outbreak that left them without manager Patrick Vieira.
The Eagles were still able to field a strong side that featured just one change from their previous outing.
However, a rejuvenated Spurs under Antonio Conte never looked back after scoring twice in two minutes just after the half hour.
Harry Kane swept home just his third Premier League goal of the season before Lucas Moura powered in a header.
Palace’s task was made even tougher when Wilfried Zaha was stupidly sent-off for two bookable offences before half-time.
Son Heung-min added a third 16 minutes from time.
West Ham United’s bid for the top four is falling apart fast as they were beaten 3-2 at home by Southampton.
The Saints led three times through Mohamed Elyounoussi, James Ward-Prowse and Jan Bednarek and held out to move nine points clear of the bottom three.
Chelsea badly need to end a poor run of one win in four league games in the late game when they visit Aston Villa, who will be without manager Steven Gerrard due to a positive Covid test.
The Blues are now nine points off City and just three clear of Arsenal.
Villa’s next match against Leeds United, scheduled for December 28, was also called off on Sunday taking the total number of Premier League games postponed over the past two weeks to 14.
No restrictions have yet been put in place for the size of crowds at matches in England, although supporters do have to provide proof of vaccination or a negative test taken in the previous 48 hours.
Sport in Wales will be forced back behind closed doors from today, while in Scotland a restriction of 500 outdoor public events has seen Scottish Premiership clubs bring forward their winter break by a week after Sunday’s fixtures.

9,Hapless England on the canvas after Boxing Day pounding,England face more honest discussions after they were bowled out for 185 on Sunday while Australia reached 61-1 at stumps.,"MELBOURNE: England’s earnest dressing-room discussions about improving shot selection failed to bear fruit on Sunday’s opening day of the third Ashes Test, as shambolic batting delivered a Boxing Day feast of wickets for Australia at Melbourne Cricket Ground. 
England face more honest discussions after they were bowled out for 185 on Sunday. Australia reached 61-1 at stumps. 
Leading 2-0 after thumping wins in Brisbane and Adelaide, holders Australia need only a draw in Melbourne to retain the urn. 
But Pat Cummins’ men will be hell-bent on taking the series outright before the New Year Test in Sydney. 
Joe Root’s England, meanwhile, need a miracle. 
Only one team has ever turned around a 2-0 deficit to win the Ashes. That was Don Bradman’s Australia, winning the 1936/37 series 3-2 on home soil. 
Admittedly England, humiliated in a 275-run defeat in Adelaide, faced a tough task to bounce back on Sunday. Australia captain Cummins won the toss and invited under-siege England to bat first on a green-tinged, seaming MCG pitch. 
England were 61-3 at lunch. By tea, the tourists were 128-6, having lost the key wicket of skipper Root for 50. 
Englands resistance with the bat lasted just 65.1 overs. World’s top-ranked bowler Cummins (3-36), spinner Nathan Lyon (3-36) and left-arm quick Mitchell Starc (2-54) combined to keep the pressure on Englands batters. 
A loose shot outside off stump by Root, a questionable cut by Ben Stokes, and a wild heave by Jos Buttler will attract heavy attention from English press after another difficult day for the tourists. 
Johnny Bairstow, who scored 35, said Australia were handed a huge advantage by winning the toss. But he conceded England’s batters needed to improve. 
“Both teams were looking to bowl first. It was overcast with the weather conditions this morning and the pitch was green,” Bairstow said. “Yes, we’re still looking for that big score. 
“We’ve got to get a bit stronger and tougher with our dismissals. We spoke about that. That’s just being honest with ourselves. 
“But we’ve seen that the pitch offered plenty [for the bowlers] today and hopefully we turn up in the morning and put pressure on to get some early inroads.” 
Asked if he was disappointed with the shot selection of Buttler and Stokes, Bairstow said players were instructed to play their natural games. 
“Naturally the execution of those [shots] wasn’t there today. They and we will look back on [those shots] and probably reassess next time,” Bairstow said. 
After batting collapses and poor bowling in the first two Tests, Root read his players the riot act — seemingly to little effect.  
Rain delayed the start of play for 30 minutes before Cummins ripped through England’s top order on his return to the team after being ruled out for the second Test at Adelaide due to being a close contact of a positive Covid-19 case. 
England’s rejigged opening partnership of Zak Crawley and Haseeb Hameed lasted 12 balls before Cummins had Hameed caught behind for a duck. 
Crawley, who replaced Rory Burns, managed 12 before edging Cummins straight to Green at gully. 
The Australia skipper bagged his third wicket in the last over before lunch, with Dawid Malan (14) edging to the slips to break a budding 48-run partnership with Root. 
Australia claimed another three wickets in the middle session, dismissing the dangerous duo of Root and Stokes (25). The departure of Buttler for three, after aiming a wild slog to deep mid-wicket off the bowling of Lyon in the last over before tea, summed up England’s struggles against Australia’s disciplined bowling. 
Root added to his side’s woes outside off stump by offering a catch to wicket-keeper Alex Carey off the bowling of Mitchell Starc at 82-4. 
Stokes tried to lift Englands scoring rate by launching into an aggressive cut shot off the bowling of Cameron Green, but the left-hander was caught at gully at 115-5. 
Debutant Scott Boland, playing at his home-state ground, claimed his first Test wicket by trapping Mark Wood leg before to the delight of the 57,100 fans at the MCG. 
Bairstow battled for his 35 before going on the offensive in the search for quick runs as his batting partners dwindled. 
He was out trying to duck a venomous Starc delivery that caught his bat and looped to gully, where Green dived forward to take a terrific catch. 
Lyon removed tailenders Jack Leach (13) and Ollie Robinson (22). 
David Warner and Marcus Harris (20 not out) shared an opening stand of 57 for Australia. Warner was caught at gully off the bowling of Jimmy Anderson for 38. 
Harris required medical attention during the following over after being struck on the hand by a bouncer from Stokes, but survived to the end of play with nightwatchman Lyon to leave the hosts in the ascendancy again this series. 
Boland, who is only the second Indigenous player to represent Australia’s Test side after Jason Gillespie, said Australia’s bowlers worked hard to make England’s batters play. 
“We tried to keep it really full in the first session, Boland said. “Their batters were pretty conscious about trying to leave the ball so we tried to keep attacking them as much as we could and we were judging ourselves on how much we could make them play. 
“As a bowling group we know we are not going to give up any soft overs. You need to take 20 wickets to win the game and that’s our motive. It’s a great attack to be a part of.”

10,CA chief insists Pakistan tour will go ahead despite Covid spike,MELBOURNE: Cricket Australia chief executive Nick Hockley has said that his team is committed to touring Pakistan in...,"MELBOURNE: Cricket Australia chief executive Nick Hockley has said that his team is committed to touring Pakistan in March next year and the series won’t be cancelled despite fresh concerns emerging over the new Omicron strain of Covid-19. 
Australia are scheduled to tour Pakistan for three Tests, three ODIs and a one-off T20, with the month-long series beginning on March 3. This will be Australia’s first Test tour of the country in 24 years. 
Due to the security issues in Pakistan, the two countries have met only in Australia, UAE and England since 1998. 
“We just had a team go over to Pakistan,” Hockley told reporters on Sunday, the first day of the Boxing Day Ashes Test against England.“We are working closely with the PCB and all the authorities. It’s a really complex endeavour, we are very committed to touring. It is absolutely our intention to tour as long as it is safe to do so.” 
Australia will also tour India and Sri Lanka next year after not playing a Test overseas since the 2019 Ashes finale at the Oval. 
After winning the Twenty20 World Cup, Australia are on the verge of winning the Ashes but Hockley said head coach Justin Langer will have to wait until the end of the home season to know if his contract will be extended. 
“I think JL, I think the whole square are doing a fantastic job,” he said. “We always said we’re going to be really focused on the two upcoming campaigns – the T20 World Cup and the T20 team did fabulously to bring that trophy home, and same for the Ashes. 
“I know JL, I know the team, they are very, very focused on this series. What we have said, before the summer, we’ll be sitting down at the end of the season to review where we go from there.” 
Hockley, however, did say that Langer would see out his contract, which expires in the middle of next year. 
“There’s no question Justin will see out his contract that goes through to the middle of next year,” Hockley said. “There’s a tour of Pakistan and there’s a lot of great cricket coming up, but as I said we’ll sit down and review where we are at the end of the Ashes.”

11,KL Rahul masterclass gives India ideal start in quest to conquer SA,Rahul made 122 not out as India reached 272-3 at the close after Indian captain Virat Kohli won the toss and decided to bat.,"

CENTURION: Indian opener K.L. Rahul ducks under a delivery from South African pacer Marco Jansen during the first Test at SuperSport Park on Sunday.—AP

 
CENTURION: Opener K.L. Rahul showed superb application to score a seventh Test century and gave India an ideal start in their quest to win a Test series in South Africa with a solid century on the first day of the first Test at SuperSport Park on Sunday. 
Rahul made 122 not out as India reached 272-3 at the close after Indian captain Virat Kohli won the toss and decided to bat on a green-tinged pitch. 
Vice-captain Rahul, who averaged 7.50 in four innings with a top score of 16 in South Africa three years ago, reached his ton off 218 balls as he toyed with a blunt home bowling attack on a slow wicket. 
He will resume on the second morning with Ajinkya Rahane (40 not out), whose place in the side had been under scrutiny but played some wonderful shots to share an unbeaten fourth-wicket stand of 73. 
Ragged South Africa looked like a side who have not played Test cricket since June, with a number of their players having had no red-ball cricket in the last six months. 
They bowled too short on a wicket providing little assistance and did not attack the stumps enough after India had won the toss and elected to bat in overcast conditions. 
The decision to select 21-year-old debutant left-arm seamer Marco Jansen (0-61) over the more experienced, and in-form, Duanne Olivier raised eyebrows too. 
The home side had to wait until the second session to make a breakthrough as India opener Mayank Agarwal (60) was trapped lbw by Lungi Ngidi (3-45) after a 117-run opening partnership with Rahul. 
Agarwal left the field vigorously shaking his head after a review from South Africa suggested the delivery was striking the top of leg stump. 
“Putting up 270 on the first day is fantastic and the key to us doing that was getting a good start,” Agarwal told reporters. “When you come abroad to places like South Africa, it is very important you apply yourself, be disciplined and come with good game-plans. That paid dividends for us. The pitch was initially quite soft and there was moisture there. We knew scoring runs on the front foot would not be easy.” 
After waiting 242 deliveries for their first wicket, the home side got with the next ball when Cheteshwar Pujara pushed forward to Ngidi and was caught off the glove and thigh-pad by Keegan Petersen at short leg. 
Pujara had only been out first ball once before in his 92-Test career — run out by Ngidi at Centurion Park in 2018. 
Captain Virat Kohli (35) is now without a Test century in 24 innings but looked in good touch before he chased a wide delivery from Ngidi and was caught by Wiaan Mulder at first slip. 
“Credit goes to them, they had good disciplines and they left well. We could have been a lot better in terms of our lines and lengths,” Ngidi said.  “We need to reset and go again.” 
The South Africa team wore black armbands in honour of anti-apartheid icon Desmond Tutu, described as the country’s moral compass, who died on Sunday aged 90. Both teams also held a minute’s silence.
