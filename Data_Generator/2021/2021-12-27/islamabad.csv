• Teachers found involved in corporal punishment can face compulsory retirement, dismissal from service
ISLAMABAD: The Federal Directorate of Education (FDE) has directed heads of all institutions to be vigilant against corporal punishment as a stringent law in this regard has been passed by the parliament and has come into force in the capital.
Under the new law, teachers found involved in corporal punishment could face compulsory retirement and dismissal from service.
The FDE, which regulates 423 educational institutions in the capital, through a letter dated Dec 22 directed the heads of institutions to ensure strict compliance with the instructions failing which major penalties may be imposed on the individuals proven guilty.
FDE’s spokesperson Abdul Waheed said: “We will ensure complete implementation of the Islamabad Capital Territory Prohibition of Corporal Punishment Act 2021. All heads have been informed about the new law and in case of its violation, the FDE will take action.”
The letter said there were two types of actions - minor and major penalties. The minor penalties included censuring, withholding for a specific period promotion or increment or financial advancement in accordance with the rules or orders pertaining to the service or post. Stoppage from promotion and recovery from pay also falls in the category of minor penalties.
Under major penalties, a teacher found guilty could face demotion to lower post or time scale, compulsory retirement, removal and dismissal from service.
“Keeping in view the seriousness of the matter, it is advised that all heads of institutions must hold a staff meeting for orientation on the Act within one week of issuance of this letter,” read the letter.
Earlier, after approval from parliament, the Act received assent of President Dr Arif Alvi on December 1.
It said: “The child has the right to be shown respect for his personality and individuality and shall not be made subject to corporal punishment or any other humiliating or degrading treatment.”
It added: “Disciplinary measures concerning the child can only be taken in accordance with the child’s dignity and under no circumstances corporal punishments or punishments which relate to the child’s physical and mental development or which may affect the child’s emotional status are allowed.”
While explaining corporal or physical punishment, the Act stated: “Any punishment in which physical force is used and intended to cause some degree of pain or discomfort however light it may be which may involve hitting (smacking, slapping, spanking) a child with the hand or with an implement (a whip, stick, belt, shoe, wooden spoon, etc). Also included are kicking, shaking or throwing a child, scratching, pinching, biting, pulling hair or boxing ears. Forcing a child to stay in uncomfortable positions, burning, scalding or forced ingestion, for example, washing a child’s mouth out with soap or forcing him to swallow hot species, including mental abuse.
It says that cognizance of offence under this Act shall be taken by a court of a magistrate upon complaint by the child on whom punishment is inflicted or the parents of such a child or his next of kin. The law will also be implemented in private educational institutions.
It stated: “The federal government shall devise a comprehensive system for the enforcement and monitoring of this Act in private institutions whether registered or unregistered.”
All private institutions shall formulate a complaint system to address corporal punishment.
Pakistan has ratified United Nations Convention on Rights of Child (1989) and in accordance with Article 19 of the convention, the government has committed to taking all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligence treatment, maltreatment or exploitation.

3,EU to provide 250m euros for clean energy initiative: PM’s aide,Says Pakistan to get funds in lieu of billions of trees planted across country,"TAXILA: Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam said the European Union (EU) had agreed to provide 250 million euros to Pakistan for assisting its clean energy transition and nature-based ecosystem solution project.
Speaking at the inaugural ceremony of a solar-based water filtration plant and later addressing a public meeting in Manoonnagar area of Hassanabdal, Mr Aslam said Pakistan would get global funding in lieu of billions of trees planted across the country through the World Bank assisted Green Bond.
He said the billion tree tsunami project was Prime Minister Imran Khan’s vision and the government wanted to ensure complete transparency in the project.
He said a third-party evaluation and monitoring of the project through IUCN, WWF-Pakistan and FAO was underway.

Says Pakistan to get funds in lieu of billions of trees planted across country

The special assistant said significant and concrete progress was made on all federal and Punjab government projects in Attock during a record time of 15 months, adding that projects worth Rs8 billion had been launched in the district.
“As many as 45 water filtration plants have been installed at a cost of Rs60 million in Attock, Hazro and Hassanabdal which will control waterborne diseases,” he said.
The PM’s aide said the step had been taken because of an increase in pathological pollution, especially in Hazro and some areas of Attock, resulting in the spread of cholera, hepatitis and typhoid.
He said soon Rs10 million would be released for every union council of NA-55 Attock for different development schemes, adding that the government was determined to control inflation and was striving hard to bring it down by taking inclusive measures.
He said the opposition was only doing politics on non-issues as they had no agenda.
“Pakistan has got a true and sincere leader in the form of Imran Khan,” Mr Aslam said, adding the government had completed development projects which the previous governments could not do in years.

Referring to initiatives taken by the Punjab government for special persons, the minister said apart from increasing the quota in jobs, special arrangements were made for the issuance of disability certificates for special persons at the tehsil level.
He said for the first time the ‘school milk programme’ was launched to provide free milk to students of 89 primary schools in Attock and Sheikhupura districts, adding that in the first phase, milk would be provided to students for six months in selected schools.
Mr Bukhari said public-private partnership aimed at welfare of persons with special needs could yield positive results, lauding the role of the NGO for providing vocational and technical training, arranging marriages and food for the neglected segments of society in Taxila, Wah and Hassanabdal without any funding from the government.
He said strict monitoring of the non-governmental organisations was being carried out and 32,000 NGOs were registered in the province, adding that after scrutiny the number had reduced to only 8,000.

7,700 pending cases registered in one day on new Islamabad IGP’s order,Three armed men snatch cash and mobile phones worth Rs1 million from staff of a bakery in the limits of Industrial Area police.,"ISLAMABAD: On the direction of the recently-appointed Inspector General of Police (IGP) Mohammad Ahsan Younus, the capital police in a single day registered over 700 pending cases of theft and other crimes.
Moreover, the police chief has directed senior officers to ensure their presence in their jurisdiction after 12pm to ensure effective patrolling and reduce crime.
A number of police stations had made a routine of not registering First Information Reports (FIRs) of theft and other crimes or just mentioned the complaints in their daily registers called Roznamcha. Because of the practice, majority of the complaints failed to get FIRs registered.
The registration of cases is considered a matter of bad repute for the station house officers (SHOs).
But after registration of a case, the FIR is shared with a number of departments and intelligence agencies increasing the chances of arrest of the criminals and recovery of looted/stolen items. However, reports mentioned in Roznamcha are not shared with any law enforcement agency. This practice decreases the chances of recovery of stolen items or action against the culprits.
After intervention by the IGP, the Margalla police registered 120 cases in a single day. One of the cases was reported on February 14 when the police was informed about a motorbike theft. But the FIR could not be registered.
Tarnol police registered 70 cases and one of the applications was submitted to the police on May 21 regarding snatching of a motorbike on gunpoint.
Aabpara police registered 24 cases and the oldest application was about an incident on May 28 in which complainant Mohammad Waqas had alleged that a citizen deprived him of his car.
Secretariat police registered 43 cases and the oldest application was filed on Jan 3 about the theft of a motorbike.
Kohsar police also registered 18 cases and one of the applications was filed on July 30 regarding the theft of a vehicle from Blue Area.
Bhara Kahu police also registered 18 cases and the oldest application was filed on January 26 regarding lifting of a car.
Similarly, the Industrial Area police (I-9) registered 72 cases, Sabzi Mandi and Ramna police 51 FIRs each, Golra police 48 FIRs, Khanna 45, Karachi Company 42, Sihala 29, Shams Colony 23, Shahzad Town police 20, Koral police 11, Banigala police 12 cases, Noon 10, Nilor seven, Loi Bher six and Shalimar police registered four FIRs in a single day.
Meanwhile, three armed persons snatched cash and mobile phones worth Rs1 million from the staff of a bakery in the limits of Industrial Area police on Sunday.
According to a statement, the IGP while chairing a crime meeting at the Police Lines Headquarters directed the officers to remain present in their respective areas from 12pm to 5am to supervise the teams.
He said he would visit to check the presence of senior officers and no laxity would be tolerated.
The meeting was attended by the DIG operations, SSP operations, SSP investigation, zonal SPs, SDPOs, SHOs, Moharars and front desk staff of police stations.
The IGP asked the participants to evolve a comprehensive policy with special focus on criminal elements and crime pockets.
He instructed the police station staff to ensure FIRs’ registration on time, adding the front desk staff was bound to register the case of any missing person in five minutes. In case of delay, the concerned officials would be held responsible.
He said all those coming to police stations should be treated with respect and dignity.
Police counters would be set up at Polyclinic and Pims to facilitate the personnel, he added.
He said the Moharar’s strength would be divided into seven sections with weekly off for each personnel.
There would be at least three Jawans in a patrolling vehicle as well as on each picket during snap checking. All officers on duty must wear bulletproof jackets and helmets.
He directed the officers to expedite crackdown on criminal elements and mobilise the recovery of stolen goods, including the arrest of those involved in heinous crimes.
The IGP also asked them to take measures to further improve public service delivery.

8,"Three years on, work on two mega projects in Pindi still not launched",MNA says work on Rawalpindi Ring Road and Leh Expressway and Flood Channel projects to start in January,"RAWALPINDI: The present government has so far failed to start work on two mega projects in the garrison city - Rawalpindi Ring Road and Leh Expressway and Flood Channel - despite a passage of over three years.
On the other hand, the Mother and Child Hospital is yet to be completed.
After coming to power, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government promised to start work on the stalled Rs105 billion Leh Expressway and Flood Channel project, the Rs30bn Ring Road project and to complete the Rs6.5bn Mother and Child Hospital at Asghar Mall.
On Oct 6 this year, Chief Minister Usman Buzdar had directed the district administration to start work on the projects by the end of the year.

MNA says work on Rawalpindi Ring Road and Leh Expressway and Flood Channel projects to start in January

The Leh Expressway and the hospital projects were launched in 2006 during the tenure of then president Pervez Musharraf. These projects were the brainchild of Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed.
However, work on the projects was stopped by the PML-N during its tenure in the Punjab from 2008 to 2018. Mr Rashid, who formed his own Awami Muslim League party and became an ally of the ruling PTI, had promised to get the projects completed.
During the 2018 election campaign, the then chief justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar also took notice of the incomplete hospital project and visited the site and issued directions to the health authorities to complete it within six months. Though work on the project was started by the PTI-led Punjab government in 2018, it is still not completed.
During the tenure of President Musharraf, the cost of the project was Rs2.5bn and a 400-bed hospital equipped with modern facilities was to be constructed. A nursing school was also part of the project. There was also a plan to establish a centre to treat TB and breast cancer patients.
But the PTI government changed the plan as the cost of the construction escalated. Now, a 200-bed hospital is being constructed along with the nursing school and the chest diseases centre.
On the other hand, the cost of Leh expressway project also escalated from Rs20bn in 2006 to Rs105bn in 2021.
The Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) approved the two road projects worth around Rs48.57bn recently. The land acquisition for Leh Expressway was approved at a cost of Rs24.961bn.
The committee directed that no expenditure should be incurred till completion of the environmental impact assessment (EIA) report.
The project to be executed by the Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) envisages acquisition of 750 kanals to provide right of way for construction of the expressway and flood channel which would constitute an integral part of the transportation network of Rawalpindi besides serving the purposes of flood mitigation and sewage disposal.
The second project approved by Ecnec was the Rawalpindi Ring Road - the main carriageway from Banth (N-5) to Thallian (M-2) - at an estimated cost of Rs23.60bn. The committee also directed authorities concerned to acquire the concurrence of the Planning Commission and include axle load management in the project.
The provincial annual development programme will finance the project and the RDA will construct the 38.3km, six-lane, access-controlled Ring Road.
The project had earlier led to a major scandal involving some PTI leaders on the basis of which Prime Minister Imran Khan sacked some of his aides and senior government officials.
When contacted, PTI MNA Sheikh Rashid Shafique said Ecnec approved the two road projects on Dec 22 and work on it would be started in January.
“Leh Expressway project’s cost escalated to Rs105bn and it will be started next month,” Mr Shafique said, adding that after Ecnec’s approval, tendering process will be started.
Mr Shafique, who is the nephew of Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, said the Mother and Child Hospital’s total cost was Rs6.5bn and it would become functional by the end of February.
He said Punjab Minister for Health Dr Yasmeen Rashid will visit the hospital on Dec 29 to inspect installation of machinery.
“The outdoor patient department will become functional in January as promised by the interior minister,” Mr Shafique said, adding that work on the Ring Road project would commence soon.

10,Govt’s role in economy limits space for entrepreneurs: PIDE,ISLAMABAD: The investment climate in Pakistan is very pragmatic and needs various corrective measures like ...,"ISLAMABAD: The investment climate in Pakistan is very pragmatic and needs various corrective measures like decreasing the government’s footprint in the economy.
This was pointed out by economist and vice chancellor of Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) Dr Nadeemul Haque and leading researcher Dr Durre Nayab while talking to a group of journalists and writers in Islamabad.
They said the greater the role of the government in the economy, lesser the space available for entrepreneurs to function, adding that the challenge was to significantly raise investment rate and productivity as these were major drivers of growth but were relatively low.
Referring to a detailed report titled ‘Reform Agenda for Accelerated and Sustained Growth’, they said research laid down the reform agenda, pursuit of which would put the country on a high and sustained growth trajectory.
For there to be a stable democracy, Dr Haque suggested proportional representation in the electoral system must be adopted which meant that for political parties to be eligible to contest elections, the parties must have elections within the party as well.
“A certain, minimal percentage of the provincial population must be inducted as party members. The legislators should not have any say in the approval and execution of development projects. Only a small proportion, maybe 5pc, of the legislators may hold executive positions, the rest should be legislators only, Dr Haque said, adding that there should be a maximum term limit (maybe two terms) for the prime minister and all the legislators.
“Additionally, the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) Funds should be decentralised and federal and provincial governments should focus only on policy formulation,” he added.
Dr Durre Nayab said cities were believed to be the engine of economic growth.
“The cities that encourage economic activity are dense, high-rise, mixed-use and inclusive. These cities provide work, home, markets, school, hospital and leisure for all close to each other. By clustering economic activities, these cities generate knowledge spill overs, on the one hand, and reduce transaction costs on the other. This is an environment conducive to innovation, which is crucial for economic growth,” she said.

12,Inquiry into Riaz Fatyana’s allegations about cabinet members concludes,"Decision to be announced soon, govt spokesman says.","ISLAMABAD: The Standing Committee on Accountability and Discipline (SCAD) has completed inquiry and reserved its ruling in the MNA Riaz Fatyana case, who alleged that a brawl between two personalities from the Ministry of Climate Change compromised Pakistan’s position at an international conference.
“MNA Riaz Fatyana has submitted a written response with the Standing Committee on Accountability. The committee will announce its decision soon,” a government spokesman told Dawn on Sunday.
In December, the PTI had issued a show-cause notice to its MNA Riaz Fatyana for allegedly making “unreasonable” demands at the recently held climate conference in Glasgow, United Kingdom and making “false” allegations against two members of the federal cabinet.
The notice was issued to the MNA from Toba Tek Singh on the complaint of Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam, days after Mr Fatyana alleged that the former had a brawl with Minister of State for Climate Change Zartaj Gul while attending the conference.

Decision to be announced soon, govt spokesman says

Mr Fatyana made the allegations during a meeting of the parliament’s Public Accounts Committee on Nov 25 and this was widely covered by the media. He had thus forth been asked to submit a written statement on or before Dec 4, along with relevant documents and evidence. “You have to show cause as to why we should not proceed against you. The nature of this disciplinary proceeding shall be inquisitorial,” the notice issued to Mr Fatyana stated.
“Upon your return, as a member of the Public Accounts Committee, you have made some absurd and totally fabricated and false assertions in the meeting held on Nov 25, including that there was a brawl between two senior officials and Zartaj Gul, which led to her leaving the conference early. However, she had left early only to attend the joint session of the parliament,” read the notice, a copy of which is available with Dawn.
“This false news was taken up by the media and caused irreparable damage to the personal reputation of the complainant, the party’s image as well as performance of Pakistan at the COP-26 which got national as well as global acclaim,” it added.
In his complaint, Mr Aslam alleged that MNA Riaz Fatyana had come to Glasgow to attend the conference on climate change funded by a non-governmental organisation (NGO) and visited the Pakistani pavilion a couple of times where he made some “unreasonable demands” such as becoming part of the official delegation, which needed the prime minister’s approval.
Mr Aslam also alleged that Mr Fatyana had demanded an official vehicle and phone SIMs for his use, “but these could, obviously, not be met as he was not part of official country delegation”.
When contacted, Mr Aslam told Dawn that he and Ms Gul had issued a joint statement denying any brawl or misunderstanding at COP-26 and termed the allegations made by Riaz Fatyana “baseless”.
“Riaz Fatyana has submitted his response with the Standing Committee on Accountability and Discipline and now we are waiting for the outcome,” said Mr Aslam, maintaining that Mr Fatyana was not a part of Pakistan’s official delegation and was representing a non-governmental organisation without any invitation of the Ministry of Climate Change.
Despite several attempts to contact Mr Fatyana, he could not be reached for comment.
