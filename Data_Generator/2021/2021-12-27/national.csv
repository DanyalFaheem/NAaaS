TEXTUAL criticism, as defined by Britannica, is “the technique of restoring texts as nearly as possible to their original form”.
Textual criticism deals with the authenticity, correct attribution, interpretation and literary and historical evaluation of texts by analysing technical, linguistic, aesthetic, historical and/or literary aspects, says Britannica.
In Urdu, textual criticism is often called tadveen (literally: editing) or taseeh-o-tadveen-e-matn (literally: correction and editing of text). Some critics stress tehqeeq (literally: research) while naming it. As an equivalent of ‘textual criticism’, Dr Khaliq Anjum used the term matni tanqeed, almost a verbatim translation. His book titled ‘Matni tanqeed was a groundbreaking work on this topic in Urdu and soon became a textbook for the students doing MPhil or PhD in Urdu literature.
For the students of literature, knowing the history as well as principles of textual criticism is must, especially if they intend to carry out a research on old texts and/or want to edit literary works. A new book, just published by Lahore’s Kitabi Dunya, would come in handy for such students. Titled Urdu mein tadveen-e-matn: fan aur rivayet, it was first published from India and now a Pakistani edition has made it easier for Pakistani readers to grab a copy, since the arrival of books and magazines from India has virtually stopped.
Author Dr Aqeel Ahmed, an Aligarh Muslim University alumnus and young researcher from Bihar, India, first defines what textual criticism is and then goes on to describe its principles. In the second chapter, he narrates a brief history of Urdu’s textual criticism and the next eight chapters analyse the edited critical works of some of Urdu’s eminent researchers.
In his intro, the author defines textual criticism as: “textual criticism is a branch of research. As a term it means to edit a text according to authorial intention and to purge the text of any changes, distortions, interpolations or any unauthorised additional portions”.
Aqeel Ahmed says it was Shibli Naumani who pioneered the textual criticism in Urdu by editing and publishing Mirza Ali Lutf’s Gulshan-e-Hind in 1906. Before Shibli, Sir Syed Ahmed Khan had edited some works but they were Persian texts, not Urdu. After Shibli, Moulvi Abdul Haq edited and published a large number of Dakani Urdu manuscripts that were mostly in debilitating and decaying state and could have been lost forever.
Next to come was Hafiz Mahmood Sherani, a scholar who edited Qudratullah Qasim’s Majmoo’a-e-naghz. Sherani was not only able to read the damaged manuscript found in Muhammad Husain Azad’s library and to edit it meticulously while comparing it with another manuscript housed at London’s India Office Library, but he also proved that the manuscript is in fact the basic source of Muhammad Husain Azad’s evergreen book Aab-e-hayat, says Aqeel Ahmed.
Dr Mohiuddin Qadri Zor edited several texts but most famous among them is Kulliyaat-e-Qulli Qutb Shah, albeit Rasheed Hasan Khan criticised it and pointed out several lapses in its editing. But the author gives credit to Dr Zor for bringing forth a rare text. Imtiaz Ali Khan Arshi is a scholar known for his edited version of Ghalib’s Urdu divan, Ghalib’s letters and Dastoor-ul-fasahat.
Other textual critics taken into account in the book under review are: Malik Ram, Prof Nazeer Ahmed, Masood Husain Khan, Rasheed Hasan Khan, Mukhtaruddin Ahmed, Jameel Jalibi and Haneef Naqvi.
One feels that this list is incomplete and many other researchers who did some remarkable works in the field of textual criticism have been left out. Aqeel Ahmed in his foreword has shown his inability to incorporate all the scholars for want of space and says that only those critics have been included who can be called “representatives” of textual criticism and who have left their mark.
Constrains of space and time must have been there, but at least in the foreword or the concluding chapter, which is missing altogether, by the way, names of some of the bigwigs, for example, Waheed Qureshi, Syed Abdullah, Ibadat Barelvi, Imtiaz Ali Taj, Khalil-ur-Rahman Dawoodi, Kalb-e-Ali Khan Faiq, Iqtida Hasan, Noor-ul-Hasan Naqvi, Afsar Siddiqi Amrohvi, Qazi Abdul Wadood, Khwaja Ahmed Farooqi, Masood Hasan Rizvi Adeeb, Khaliq Anjum and Kalidas Gupta Raza could have been mentioned.
It is true that history of Urdu criticism is too long to be captured in a 600-page volume, but what the author could have done was to be selective on the basis of some criterion. For example, prominent scholars belonging to India whose works had appeared in pre-Independence era could have been included. Or he might have chosen scholars from Pakistan and India in post- independent era, delimiting the scope of research. In the present form, the book does justification neither to Indian nor to Pakistani scholars. However, it is a work much needed.

2,Delay in Dhabeji industrial zone project irks CPEC Authority chief,Petition in SHC challenging award of contract is also believed to have impeded progress.,"ISLAMABAD: Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on CPEC Affairs Kha­lid Mansoor has expressed displeasure over the delay in taking off of the ambitious Dhabeji industrial zone (DIZ) in Thatta and said that three other special economic zones (SEZs) that are part of the corridor project were near completion. 
Mr Mansoor, who is also the chairman of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) Authority, told Dawn on Sunday that a judgement reserved by the Sindh High Court (SHC) on a petition challenging the award of a contract for developing the DIZ had further caused the delay in initiating the project. 
The high court reserved its judgement on December 6 but has yet to announce it.
According to a notification, the winter holidays of the high court started from Sunday and will continue until Jan 9. “It is believed that the judgement will be announced after winter vacations of the court,” a senior official of Sindh Economic Zones Management Company (SEZMC) said.
The CPEC Authority has already submitted an official statement to the SHC, expressing satisfaction over the bidding process and that no irregularity had been committed in the award of the contract.

Petition in SHC challenging award of contract is also believed to have impeded progress

An SEZMC document shows the Dhabeji industrial zone will be declared a special economic zone later since it is a part of the CPEC.
The multibillion project will be developed under public-private partnership by the successful bidder Zahir Khan & Brothers (ZKB) and the Sindh government.
The project, spread over 1,500 acres, is being executed in a joint collaboration with the federal government, the Sindh government and the CPEC Authority to make it a hub of major economic activity in the province.
The Sindh government received bids of the project in February this year. After a two-month evaluation period, one of the bids was challenged and was declared “technically unfit”. Therefore, the provincial government decided to hold re-bidding in which ZKB turned out to be the successful bidder and was issued the letter of award by the provincial government. 
The award of the contract was challenged in the SHC with the plea that SEZ rules had not been followed in awarding the contract.
However, SAPM Khalid Mansoor said the petitioner had challenged the award of the contract on “very weak grounds” and “it is unfortunate that the project is still in the doldrums”.
“It is totally absurd that Dhabeji is not the part of CPEC,” Mr Mansoor said while rejecting the claim of the petitioner.
The Sindh government is of the view that since the DIZ has not been given the status of an SEZ, the rules of special economic zones were not applied to it.
In a meeting on November 23 on development projects in Sindh, Prime Minister Khan expressed a desire that all economic zones, including the Dhabeji industrial zone, should be completed as soon as possible.
Sources said the successful bidder had not yet signed an agreement with the Sindh government amid litigation. 
Under the contract, the successful firm will undertake designing, financing, construction, operation and maintenance of the Dhabeji industrial zone on a build, own, operate and transfer basis.
The DIZ is located near the port city of Karachi, some 35 kilometres from the M-9 motorway, close to seaports of Bin Qasim Port and Karachi Port.
According to the layout plan, the DIZ will have 130 heavy industries, 145 medium industries, 211 light industries, 82 warehouses, commercial area, office area, mosques, grid stations, roads, lanes, recreation areas, captive power generation facility and intake points for telephone, gas and electric utility companies.

3,Sindh ready to hold local govt polls in Feb-March: CM Murad,Says Zardari won’t attend Benazir’s death anniversary event today.,"LARKANA: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Sunday said he had conveyed to the Election Commission of Pakistan his government’s intention of holding local bodies elections in the province in February or March. 
“We are ready after legislation regarding LG elections. The PPP will form next government in Sindh as we have done everything in the interest of the province,” Mr Shah said while talking to media persons at the mausoleum of slain former prime minister Benazir Bhutto in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh where he laid wreaths and offered fateha. 

Says Zardari won’t attend Benazir’s death anniversary event today 

He said Pakistan Peoples Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had called a meeting of the party’s Central Executive Committee in the first week of January. He said the health of PPP co-chairman and former president Asif Ali Zardari did not permit him to participate in the death anniversary event of Benazir Bhutto on Dec 27 in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh. 
In an apparent reference to Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s (PTI) defeat in the local government polls in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, he said it was the result of people’s disapproval of Prime Minister Imran Khan’s policies, adding that the people’s reaction could be gauged from the volume of responses they had accorded to Asif Ali Zardari during his recent visits. 
In reply to a question, CM Shah did not rule out the possibility of talks with various parties but said coalition with them in the past was a bitter experience. He said the PPP was ready to work with any party which served Sindh’s interests. 
He said Imran Khan could better answer why the PTI chose to form an alliance with the Muttahida Qaumi Movement. 
About Green Line bus service, the chief minister said the Sindh government had also extended financial assistance to the project and provided land after amending laws in this regard as it was in the interest of Sindh. He said the federal government had in 2018 proposed that if the Sindh government distanced itself from the project, the Centre would complete it within three months, but till 2021 it was incomplete. 
Mr Shah said the PTI government had destroyed the country’s economy and people could hardly afford to have meals twice a day. 
MNA Ramesh Lal, Naseeban Channa, PPP leader Shagufta Jumani and Larkana commissioner and deputy commissioner were present on the occasion.

4,"Urea shortage, higher prices to affect wheat crop in Sindh: farmers",Growers want immediate remedial action against fertiliser hoarders.,"HYDERABAD: As wheat crop sowing comes to a close in Sindh, farmers complain that higher prices of urea — and at times its unavailability — are likely to affect crop productivity across the province.
Wheat growers stress that remedial measures must be taken immediately, especially against hoarders.
However, the fertiliser review committee in its weekly meeting,  presided over by Minister for Industries and Production Khusro Bakhtyar, noted on Friday that punitive measures undertaken against hoarders and profiteers had resulted in a significant reduction in urea prices close to the notified rate of Rs1,768 per 50kg bag. 

Growers want immediate remedial action against fertiliser hoarders

The committee not only ruled out any shortage of urea for the Rabi season but also noted that its price had declined significantly.
But stakeholders in Sindh paint a different picture. 
Hidayatullah Chhajro, the director general of Sindh government’s agriculture extension department, told Dawn by phone on Saturday that urea fertiliser was being smuggled to Afghanistan to make an extra buck. “Sindh is not getting its share and big dealers have hoarded it and supply this important farm input to sub-dealers at a higher price,” he said.
Against the provincial requirement of 14.5 million bags, fertiliser factories issued 9.3m bags, he said. Besides, the bulk of these bags had been dumped by big dealers, he added.
“The situation has improved in Hyderabad, Tando Allahyar, Tando Mohammad Khan and Sukkur to some extent and the price dropped by Rs150 per bag,” he remarked. Hoarders would be dealt with by the district administration, he said.
The wheat crop has been grown on around 1.15 million hectares (over 2.84m acres) in Sindh this season and the demand for urea has increased as a result. At least two bags of urea are applied per acre within 45 days of sowing wheat crop in addition to a bag of diammonium phosphate. Three major fertiliser producing industrial units — Fauji Fertiliser Corporation, Engro and Fatima — cater to urea’s needs of the farm sector.
However, farmers complain that urea prices remain unusually higher. “I myself bought a 50kg urea bag for Rs2,800, which is significantly higher than the officially notified price of Rs1,768,” said Nabi Bux Sathio, the vice president of the Sindh Chamber of Agriculture.
On Dec 22, Sindh’s agriculture secretary informed the federal secretary of the Ministry of Industries and Production about the shortage of urea in Sindh, fearing a decrease in the per-acre yield of wheat in the province.
According to his figures, 97pc of wheat sowing target had been achieved in Sindh, but urea shortage may affect the crop. Referring to a letter of Sindh agriculture department’s director general, he said that a shortage of 268,574 tonnes of urea (or 5.371m bags) was being reported in 23 districts of the province. 
“Growers are buying urea bags for Rs2,400 and Rs2,800 from the open market, which may lead to a loss of Rs5 billion to Rs7bn to farmers in terms of increased costs if the situation persists,” said Sindh Abadgar Board vice president Mehmood Nawaz.
He said the urea shortage was unfathomable since there was no shortage of gas for fertiliser factories. He estimated that around 8m urea bags of 50kg each were required for wheat crop alone and another 1m bags for other Rabi crops like sunflower, rapeseed, etc. “This trend, if continues, will impact the Kharif crop sowing as well,” he said.

5,FO condemns killing of six Kashmiris,ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Sunday strongly condemned the extrajudicial killing of six more Kashmiris by Indian ...,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Sunday strongly condemned the extrajudicial killing of six more Kashmiris by Indian occupation forces in Indian Illegally Occu­pied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK).
“Pakistan strongly condemns extrajudicial killings of six more Kashmiri youth in IIOJK by Indian occupation forces in the last three days in continuing fake enco­unters and so-called cordon-and-search-operations,” the Foreign Office spokesperson said in a statement.
He said a 19-year-old student was killed on Sunday by Indian forces with impunity in the Islamabad area of IIOJK. 
At least 18 Kashmiris have been killed by Indian occupation forces in December so far.
The FO spokesperson said the occupation army had intensified arbitrary detentions, night raids, coercion, harassment and humiliation of Kashmiris, and the extrajudicial killings in staged encounters and cordon-and-search operations continued unabated.
He said the burial of the last remains at unknown locations since April last year, without the consent and presence of their families, was yet another abhorrent manifestation of the callous behaviour and moral bankruptcy of BJP-RSS combine.
He said India should be well aware that no amount of oppression and use of force could break the will of the valiant Kashmiri people who were resolutely standing up against India’s state-terrorism in IIOJK, and struggling for their inalienable right to self-determination as ensh­rined in the relevant UN Security Council resolutions.
The FO spokesperson reiterated Pakistan’s call on the international community to hold India accountable for its grave and systematic violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in IIOJK.
The violations must be investigated by an independent commission of inquiry as recommended by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in its reports of 2018 and 2019, he added.

7,Autopsy reveals US woman was choked to death,"Knife wounds found on neck; her jacket, phone recovered; suspect’s physical remand extended.","RAWALPINDI: A US national of Pakistan origin murdered by her former husband in Rawalpindi was choked to death and also had two knife wounds on her neck, her post-mortem examination showed on Sunday. 
Rizwan Habib Bangash, 29, confessed to killing his former wife — 47-year-old Wajiha Farooq Swati — and burying her body in Lakki Marwat, Rawalpindi City Police Officer (CPO) Sajid Kiani disclosed on Saturday. Her body was later excavated from a house in Lakki Marwat district.
Ms Swati’s jacket and phone have also been recovered by the police, but they are still working to recover the murder weapon and apprehend other individuals involved in moving and burying her body.

Knife wounds found on neck; her jacket, phone recovered; suspect’s physical remand extended 

On the other hand, a judicial magistrate extended the physical remand of the main suspect, Rizwan Bangash, for three days on Sunday and also remanded his father and his employee in police custody for three days.  
Both the father of the suspect and his employee had facilitated the transfer of her body from Rawalpindi to the burial place.
The police have requested the judicial magistrate to extend the physical remand of Bangash as they had to recover the car in which her body wrapped in a piece of carpet was shifted to Lakki Marwat was yet to be recovered by the police.
However, the police have recovered the mobile phone of Ms Wajiha, her jacket and some other things, while efforts were under way to arrest other people involved in her murder and dumping her body. 
Nobody from Wajiha’s family had come to the police to claim her body so far, though her brother and mother lived in Rawalpindi and her body was kept in the mortuary of District Headquarters Hospital. 
Sources privy to the investigation revealed that there was no religious motive for the murder. However, the police suspect that Bangash could be involved in drugs trafficking and the police would investigate the sources of his income. 
Ms Swati landed at Islamabad airport with her nephew on October 16 at around 6.30am and went to Bangash’s house in Defence Housing Authority Phase-I where she slept until 2pm. Meanwhile, the suspect sent his three servants out of his home for some chores. 
The sources said Ms Swati was probably murdered between 2pm and 5pm, probably after an argument with the suspect. The suspect wrapped her body in a piece of carpet and put it in the boot of his car and left for Lakki Marwat with his servant.
The suspect had been in contact with his father, who arrived in Jhand from his native town Hangu where Bangash handed over the car containing the body to shift it to Lakki Marwat where his employee Sultan lived.
On reaching Lakki Marwat, they dumped her body in the courtyard of Sultan’s sister’s house after digging a six-foot deep ditch. Later, a concrete floor was laid to hide the crime.
On the other hand, Bangash returned to his house in Rawalpindi from Jhand and started preparing a plan to cover up the crime. He took two weeks to consult lawyers and educate his servants, telling them how to deal with the incident in case the police approached them, the sources said. 
“The murder suspect was so confident that he had continuously been dodging the then investigating police team despite being investigated in connection with the disappearance of the woman,” the sources said, adding that the Rawalpindi CPO — who assumed office earlier this month — directed the police to arrest Bangash and interrogate him. 
Despite being in police custody, he remained confident and did not disclose anything. However, he later confessed to the crime when his father was produced before him in the lock-up after being brought from Hangu.
When contacted, the police chief said that there was no religious aspect behind Ms Swati’s murder. The suspect was against her socialisation and often the couple had a quarrel over property worth millions of rupees which she had transferred in his name. 
“The police will also investigate the sources of [Bangash’s] income, including his involvement in drugs [trafficking],” the CPO said.

8,MQM to protest in NA over Sindh CM’s controversial speech today,PPP terms govt’s move to convene sitting on Dec 27 mala fide.,"ISLAMABAD: Members of the Mutt­ahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) through a calling-attention notice are set to lodge their protest on the floor of the National Assembly on Monday (today) over a recent controversial speech delivered by Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah in the provincial assembly as Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) termed the inclusion of the notice in the agenda mala fide and against rules.
The National Assembly secretariat has placed the calling-attention notice submitted by five MQM members on the Orders of the Day issued for the sitting of the lower house of parliament on Monday.
Through the notice, MQM lawmakers have invited the attention of federal Human Rights Minister Dr Shireen Mazari to a matter of urgent public importance regarding the Sindh CM’s hate speech, causing grave concern among the general public.
Federal Minister for Information Technology and Telecommunications Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, Kishwer Zehra, Usama Qadri, Sabir Hussain Kaimkhani and Iqbal Muhammad Ali Khan are movers of the notice.

PPP terms govt’s move to convene sitting on Dec 27 mala fide

The assembly will take up the notice on a day when a majority of PPP members will be attending a ceremony at Garhi Khuda Bakhsh to mark the 14th death anniversary of former party chairperson Benazir Bhutto.
Interestingly, the calling-attention notice on the issue of gas shortage in Karachi moved by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) MNA Faheem Khan and on the agenda for the past two days, has been mysteriously dropped from the agenda to accommodate the MQM’s notice. 
Under the rules, only two calling-attention notices can be placed on the agenda on a single day.
MQM members have moved the notice to protest against the Dec 11 speech of the  Sindh chief minister in the provincial assembly in which he had lashed out at the opposition for trying to create a rural-urban ethnic divide.
“Do you want people from Islamabad to occupy Sindh? The people of Sindh will never allow such an occupation. Yes, we are part of Pakistan and we should be considered a part of Pakistan. Don’t create a situation that people start thinking about something different. You are in minority and will remain in minority and can never take decisions,” the Sindh chief minister had said in his speech.
The members of the opposition in Sindh Assembly belonging to PTI had submitted a resolution to the provincial assembly secretariat demanding an apology from Mr Shah. 
The resolution described CM Shah’s speech biased and anti-state and warned him that the party’s protest campaign against the recently-passed Sindh Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2021 would continue.
In the resolution, the opposition members said that Mr Shah had used the phrase to throw the members out of the House and the PTI asked him to withdraw his hate speech and apologise on his biased and hateful statement.
Talking to Dawn on Sunday, PPP MNA Shazia Marri lashed out at National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser for allowing inclusion of the controversial calling-attention notice on the agenda and also for convening the assembly session on the day of the death anniversary of Ms Benazir Bhutto.
Ms Marri claimed that they had already requested the speaker not to call the assembly session on Dec 27 as the death anniversary of late Ms Bhutto was a national tragedy. 
She said the speaker and everyone in Pakistan knew that PPP leaders, members and activists gathered at Garhi Khuda Bakhsh on this day every year to pay homage to their leaders.
Ms Marri said that under the rules, the speech of the chief executive of a province delivered on the floor of the assembly were protected and could not even be challenged or questioned in a court of law and in other assemblies
“I feel that the calling-attention notice has been needlessly allowed to be listed on the agenda with a clear mala fide intention,” she alleged.
Moreover, Ms Marri said, the previous calling-attention notice on the issue of gas shortage in Karachi had not been dispensed with as per rules which also proved mala fide intentions of the government. Unfortunately, she said, the speaker’s office was being used to spoil the environment in the assembly. 
She claimed that opposition members had been previously told by the government that there would be no session of the National Assembly in December, adding that if the assembly session was so necessary then it could have been called earlier.
Ms Marri also criticised the government for placing resolutions seeking extension in the life of six ordinances. Out of these six ordinances, she said, four had already expired. Under the rules, she said the life of an already expired ordinance could not be extended.
The agenda item shows that the government is seeking extension to the Federal Government Properties Management Authority Ordinance, 2021, with effect from Dec 15 whereas it has placed resolutions on the agenda seeking extension to the Public Properties (Removal of Encroac­hment) Ordinance, 2021, the Regulation of Generation, Transmission and Distribution of Electric Power (Amendment) Ordinance, 2021, and the Public Private Partnership Authority (Amendment) Ordinance, 2021, from Dec 22.
Despite repeated attempts, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Parliamentary Affairs Babar Awan could not be contacted for his comments on the issue.

Speaking to media persons after the 6th National Writers Conference at Al-Hamra on Sunday, Mr Khawar said the PML-N’s “Respect to Vote” slogan had turned out to be a hollow promise as the party is now eyeing yet another deal. He said former premier Nawaz Sharif would be treated as per law and his fate would be decided by courts. 
He said the Sharif family did not even bother to comment on transfer of billions of rupees into bank accounts of their employees. “Today, for the first time, all state institutions are on the same page.”
In reply to a question, the SACM said changes in the PTI’s administrative structure were part of preparations for the second phase of local government elections in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab.
Claiming that the PTI was currently the most democratic party in the country, Mr Khawar said the party neither followed dynastic politics nor had a kitchen cabinet where a family decided the fate of 220 million people at the breakfast table.

10,Qasim Suri aims to reorganise PTI Balochistan at grassroots level,"“The prime minister has assigned me an important responsibility and I will fulfil it honestly and through hard work,"" he says.","QUETTA: National Assembly Deputy Speaker Qasim Khan Suri, who has been appointed president of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s (PTI) Balochistan’s chapter by Prime Minister Imran Khan, said on Sunday he would organise the party at the grassroots level and make it a true representative of the people of the province.
“The prime minister has assigned me an important responsibility and I will fulfil it honestly and through hard work, taking the people along with me,” Mr Suri said while talking to the media on his arrival at Quetta airport from Islamabad.
On Saturday, Prime Minister Imran Khan nominated new office-bearers of the PTI at the central and provincial levels a day after dissolving the party’s organisational structure across the country.
The dissolution came after the party’s dismal performance in the local bodies’ elections in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa where the party has been ruling for more than eight years.
Mr Suri denied reports of any differences within the party over the nomination of new office-bearers and said news circulating in this regard were baseless and political propaganda.
On his nomination, Mr Suri said it was not the first time the prime minister had put him in charge of the PTI’s Balochistan chapter, as he had served in the role twice.
“I am from Balochistan and will work with the people of the province and reorganise the party with the consultation of the people and party leadership,” he said, adding that the PTI was one and will remain united under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Imran Khan.
On a question about reports that PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif was coming back to Pakistan, Mr Suri said: “We also want Nawaz Sharif to come back and complete his remaining jail term awarded by the courts.”
On development projects in Balochistan, he said most of the National Highway Authority’s projects in the country were going on in Balochistan. “A lot of development work is being done in Balochistan. We will work for developing the areas left behind and for which the prime minister has announced a huge package,” he said.
