0,60 killed in Haiti as fuel tanker explodes,The blast is the latest disaster to hit the nation where violent gangs have triggered crippling fuel shortages by cutting supply.,"PORT PRINCE: At least 60 people were killed when a fuel tanker truck exploded in the Haitian city of Cap-Haitien on Tuesday morning, a local official said, with overwhelmed medics saying the toll was feared to rise.
The blast is the latest disaster to hit the poverty-wracked Caribbean nation, where violent gangs have triggered crippling fuel shortages by choking off supply, and the president’s assassination five months ago has yet to be elucidated.
“We have now counted 60 deaths,” Deputy Mayor Patrick Almonor said, adding that authorities were still searching for additional victims amid the charred debris in Cap-Haitien, Haiti’s second-largest city located on the northern coast.
Almonor earlier described a horrific scene at the blast site, saying he had seen more than 50 people  “burned alive” and that it was  “impossible to identify them.” According to Almonor, the truck is believed to have flipped over after the driver lost control while swerving to avoid a motorcycle taxi.
Fuel spilled onto the road and pedestrians apparently rushed to collect the fuel, a precious commodity as Haiti grapples with a severe fuel shortage caused by the tightening grip of criminal gangs on the capital Port-au-Prince.
Almonor said around 20 houses in the area were also set ablaze, but that no details were yet available on possible victim numbers inside the homes.
Nearby Justinien University Hospital was overwhelmed with patients as the injured were transported to the facility.
“We don’t have the ability to treat the number of seriously burned people,” a nurse said. “I’m afraid we won’t be able to save them all,” she said.
A doctor at the hospital told local radio station Magik9 that two people had died there and that 40 other patients were seriously injured.
“The people are burned on more than 60 percent of their body,” she said. Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry decreed a period of national mourning following the explosion he said had left dozens of people injured.
“I learned with sadness and emotion the terrible news of the explosion of a fuel tanker last night in Cap-Haitien,” Henry tweeted.

1,UN validation of Siberia’s heat record sounds alarm bells over climate change,This is the first time the WMO has added record heat in the Arctic to its archive of extreme weather reports.,"GENEVA: The UN on Tuesday officially recognised the 38 degrees Celsius measured in Siberia last year as a new record high for the Arctic, sounding “alarm bells” over climate change.
The sweltering heat — equivalent to 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit — was seen on June 20, 2020, in the Russian town of Verkhoyansk, marking the highest temperature ever recorded above the Arctic Circle, the World Meteorological Organisation said.
This is the first time the WMO has added record heat in the Arctic to its archive of extreme weather reports, and it comes amid an unprecedented wave of record temperature spikes globally, the UN agency said.
“This new Arctic record is one of a series of observations reported to the WMO Archive of Weather and Climate Extremes that sound the alarm bells about our changing climate,” its chief Petteri Taalas said in a statement.
Verkhoyansk lies about 115 kilometres north of the Arctic Circle and temperatures have been measured there since 1885.
The temperature, which the agency pointed out was “more befitting the Mediterranean than the Arctic”, was measured at a meteorological station during an exceptionally prolonged Siberian heatwave.
The average temperatures across Arctic Siberia reached up to 10C above normal for much of the summer last year, it said, adding that this had fuelled fires and massive sea-ice loss.
The heatwave also played a significant role in 2020 being designated one of the three warmest years on record globally.
Last year also saw a new record high of 18.3C for the Antarctic continent, Taalas said.
The WMO is still seeking to verify the 54.4C recorded in both 2020 and 2021 in the world’s hottest place, Death Valley in California.
And its experts are also working on validating a new European temperature record of 48.8C reported on the Italian island of Sicily this past summer.
The WMO’s archive “has never had so many ongoing simultaneous investigations”, Taalas said.

2,"UAE suspends talks with US on purchase of F-35 planes, drones worth $23bn",A person familiar with the matter says the US believes the move is a negotiating tactic to try to move the process along.,"WASHINGTON: The United Arab Emirates suspended talks on a $23 billion deal to purchase American-made F-35 planes, armed drones and other equipment on Tuesday, in a rare dispute between Washington and a key ally in the Gulf. 
The Emirati embassy in Washington said it would suspend discussions with the US, though meetings at the Pentagon this week between the two sides on other matters would move forward as planned.  
The US remains the UAE’s preferred provider for advanced defence requirements and discussions for the F-35 may be reopened in future, the embassy said in a statement. 
The proposed sale of 50 F-35s to the UAE came at the end of former president Donald Trump’s administration, emerging from a deal that saw the Emiratis formally recognise Israel. President Joe Biden’s administration put the deal on hold after he took office, in part due to criticism of the UAE and Saudi Arabia over their role in the conflict in Yemen. 
Also included in the deal are 18 advanced drone systems and a package of air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions. Emirati officials blamed an American insistence on restrictions on how and where the F-35s could be used and said they were a violation of sovereignty.
The State Department said in a statement that the administration remained committed to the proposed sales ... even as “we continue consultations to ensure that we have a clear, mutual understanding of Emirati obligations and actions before, during, and after delivery”. 
Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters that US requirements on the use of American-made military equipment were universal, non-negotiable, and not specific to the UAE. The US partnership with the UAE is more strategic and more complex than any one weapon sale, Kirby said. 
A person familiar with the matter said the US believed the Emiratis’ move now was a negotiating tactic to try to move the process along. The person said the UAE letter notifying the US of the suspension was written by a relatively low-level official. 
The Wall Street Journal first disclosed the suspension of negotiations. 
The UAE has long worked with the US on counter-terrorism and allowed the entry of people fleeing Afghanistan during the chaotic US withdrawal earlier this year. But tensions between Washington and Abu Dhabi have risen over the UAE’s growing cooperation with China. 
Last week, a top Emirati diplomat acknowledged the UAE stopped construction on a Chinese facility at an Abu Dhabi port that America considered a military base. The Journal first revealed the presence of the alleged facility. 
“We took these American concerns into consideration and we stopped the work on the facilities,” the diplomat, Anwar Gargash, told a meeting of the Gulf States Instit­ute in Washington.

3,France blames Iran for deadlock in nuclear talks,"""Iran’s continued nuclear escalation means that we are rapidly reaching the end of the road,"" says France’s ambassador to the UN.","UNITED NATIONS: The door to resuscitate the 2015 Iran nuclear deal is open for now, but “we are rapidly reaching the end of the road” to revive a pact that is being “hollowed out by Iran’s nuclear advances”, France’s ambassador to the United Nations said on Tuesday. 
“We are nearing the point where Iran’s escalation of its nuclear programme will have completely hollowed out the JCPOA,” France’s Nicolas de Riviere told reporters.  
He was referring to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action — the formal name for the deal reached between Iran and the five permanent UN members plus Germany six years ago. 
“The diplomatic door is firmly open for Iran to a deal now. Iran has to choose between the collapse of the JCPOA and a fair and comprehensive deal ... Iran’s continued nuclear escalation means that we are rapidly reaching the end of the road.”

4,Drugmaker Pfizer says Covid-19 pill near 90pc effective,"“It’s a stunning outcome,” Pfizer Chief Scientific Officer Mikael Dolsten says in an interview.","NEW YORK: Pfizer Inc on Tuesday said final analysis of its antiviral Covid-19 pill still showed near 90pc efficacy in preventing hospitalisations and deaths in high-risk patients, and recent lab data suggests the drug retains its effectiveness against the fast spreading Omicron variant of the coronavirus.
The US drugmaker last month said the oral medicine was around 89pc effective in preventing hospitalisations or deaths when compared to placebo, based on interim results in around 1,200 people. The data disclosed on Tuesday includes an additional 1,000 people.
Nobody in the trial who received the Pfizer treatment died, compared with 12 deaths among placebo recipients.
The Pfizer pills are taken with the older antiviral ritonavir every 12 hours for five days beginning shortly after onset of symptoms. If authorised, the treatment will be sold as Paxlovid.
“It’s a stunning outcome,” Pfizer Chief Scientific Officer Mikael Dolsten said in an interview.
“We’re talking about a staggering number of lives saved and hospitalisations prevented. And of course, if you deploy this quickly after infection, we are likely to reduce transmission dramatically,” Dolsten said.
Pfizer also released early data from a second clinical trial suggesting that the treatment reduced hospitalisations by around 70pc in a smaller trial of standard-risk adults, including some higher-risk vaccinated people. The results were not statistically significant, but Pfizer said they showed a  “positive data trend for reduction in risk.”  The trial did not show that the drug alleviated symptoms of Covid-19 in the same population.
The results in standard-risk individuals are from interim analyses at 60pc and 80pc of enrollment of the now fully-enrolled trial of over 1,100 people. Pfizer will continue the trial and release more data when its done.
Dolsten said he expects authorisation for use in high-risk individuals from the US Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory agencies soon. He does not believe an FDA advisory panel meeting will be needed.
“We’re in very advanced regulatory dialogues with both Europe and the UK, and we have dialogues with most of the major regulatory agencies globally,” Dolsten said. Pfizer submitted data to the US FDA last month, asking for emergency use authorization of the drug. The FDA’s decision could come within a matter of weeks, if not days, said Zarina Saidova, an analyst at Moscow-based Finam Holdings, as the new data confirms what the company previously disclosed and submitted to the regulator.

5,India probes Mother Teresa charity for ‘forced conversion’,"AHMEDABAD: Indian police are probing a charity started by Mother Teresa, officials said on Tuesday, in the latest...","AHMEDABAD: Indian police are probing a charity started by Mother Teresa, officials said on Tuesday, in the latest example of growing pressure on Christians under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist government.
Authorities in the western state of Gujarat said they were investigating whether the Missionaries of Charity forced girls in its shelter home there to wear a cross and read the Bible.
Modi’s home state is one of several in Hindu-majority India where vaguely worded rules against  “forceful conversion” have been put in place, or more strictly enforced, in recent years.
District social officer Mayank Trivedi said that his complaint to the police was based on a report by child welfare authorities and other district officials.
According to the complaint, 13 Bibles were found in the library of the institute and girls staying there were forced to read the religious text.
The Missionaries of Charity, founded in 1950 by the late Mother Teresa — a Roman Catholic nun who lived and worked in Kolkata for most of her life and won the Nobel Peace Prize — denied the allegations.
Activists say that religious minorities in India have faced increased levels of discrimination and violence since Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power in 2014.
In 2020, the US Commission on International Religious Freedom listed India as a  “country of particular concern” for the first time since 2004.
Modi’s government rejects having a radical  “Hindutva” (Hindu hegemony) agenda and insists that people of all religions have equal rights.

6,"Taliban behind 72 extrajudicial killings, says UN",Taliban foreign ministry spokesman Abdul Qahar Balkhi denies employees of the previous administration being persecuted.,"GENEVA: The UN said on Tuesday there were  “credible allegations” of more than 100 extrajudicial killings in Afghanistan since the Taliban took power in August, with most carried out by the country’s new rulers.
United Nations deputy rights chief Nada Al-Nashif said she was deeply alarmed by continuing reports of such killings, despite a general amnesty announced by the Taliban after their August 15 takeover.
“Between August and November, we received credible allegations of more than 100 killings of former Afghan national security forces and others associated with the former government,” she told the UN Human Rights Council. “At least 72 of these killings,” she said, were  “attributed to the Taliban”.
“In several cases, the bodies were publicly displayed. This has exacerbated fear among this sizeable category of the population,” she said.
Taliban foreign ministry spokesman Abdul Qahar Balkhi said the government was  “fully committed” to the amnesty decree, and denied employees of the previous administration were being persecuted.
Anyone  “found breaching the amnesty decree will be prosecuted and penalised”, he said.
“Incidents will be thoroughly investigated but unsubstantiated rumours should not be taken at face value.” Al-Nashif, who presented Tuesday’s update to the council on behalf of UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet, said many members of the militant  Islamic State group — a main Taliban enemy — had also been killed.
“In Nangarhar province alone, there... appears to be a pattern of at least 50 extrajudicial killings of individuals suspected to be members of the IS,” she said, with reports of  “brutal methods... including hanging, beheadings, and public display of corpses.” Her comments came after the United States and other countries harshly condemned the Taliban following a Human Rights Watch report earlier this month documenting 47 summary executions.

7,"Storm dumps snow, drenches parched regions in California","Latest drought monitor shows parts of Montana, Oregon, California, Nevada, Utah are classified as being in exceptional drought.","SAN FRANCISCO: Motorists spun out on whitened mountain passes and residents wielded umbrellas that flopped in the face of fierce winds as northern California absorbed even more rain and snow on Monday, bringing the possibility of rockslides and mudslides to areas scarred by wildfires following an especially warm and dry fall across the US West.
Kirkwood Mountain Resort was closed, saying on social media that it was not safe to open with 17 inches (43 centimetres) of overnight snow and high winds. A California Highway Patrol car in Truckee nudged a big-rig up a snowy hill while smaller vehicles spun out, resulting in minor bumps and bruises but no real injuries, CHP Officer Carlos Perez said.
Its just so bad and so thick, he said of the snowfall, with more expected Monday night. We’re telling people that if they don’t need to be around this area, they probably shouldn’t travel.
The multiday storm, a powerful atmospheric river weather system that is sucking up moisture from the Pacific Ocean, raised the threat of flooding and was expected to dump more than 8 feet (2.4 metres) of snow on the highest peaks in California and Nevada and drench other parts of the two states before it moves on midweek, forecasters said.
The storm will bring much needed moisture to the broader region that’s been gripped by drought that scientists have said is caused by climate change. The latest US drought monitor shows parts of Montana, Oregon, California, Nevada and Utah are classified as being in exceptional drought, which is the worst category.
Most western US reservoirs that deliver water to states, cities, tribes, farmers and utilities rely on melted snow in the springtime.
