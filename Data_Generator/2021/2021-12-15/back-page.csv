0,No-trust move only when system has no intrusion: Abbasi,"To test the waters, PPP asked to table motion against Senate chairman.","LAHORE: PML-N senior vice president Shahid Khaqan Abbasi has said the party will not consider moving a no-confidence motion against the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government at the Centre or in Punjab till it is clear that the constitution is supreme in the country and the system is being run without “interference” as per democratic principles and norms. 
“The PPP has stated several times that a no-confidence motion should be moved in Punjab. To test the waters, I ask them to table no-trust motion against Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani in the Senate where the opposition has a clear and demonstrated majority,” Mr Abbasi said while talking to Dawn on Tuesday. 
Asked whether such a move was possible till the establishment’s alleged support to the government dwindled, the PML-N leader said: “So far, there have been no deliberations in the PML-N over a definite no-confidence move against the federal or Punjab government, but the option is always on the table. It is not possible to move a constitutional no-confidence motion in a system which is not running constitutionally,” he said. The way votes were managed in the recent joint sitting of parliament did not inspire confidence that any lessons had been learnt from “past mistakes”, he added. 

To test the waters, PPP asked to table motion against Senate chairman  

Since the issue of appointment of new Inter-Services Intelligence chief, there were rumours that Prime Minister Imran Khan and the establishment were no longer on the proverbial same page, generating a debate among the PML-N ranks that if it was the case they could consider a no-confidence motion against the Senate chairman where the opposition has a majority.  
PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif, who has been in London since November 2019 for his medical treatment, had engaged the main leadership of the opposition alliance, Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), to submit a ‘working plan’ about tabling no-trust motion against either Mr Sanjrani, National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaisar or Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar, but no consensus was reached on the proposal.  
Former premier Abbasi said the opposition had already seen the way the situation was allegedly manoeuvered for the PTI government in the joint session of parliament last month (where it managed to bulldoze amendments to the Elections Act 2017). “So it is not the right time for any such move (no-confidence motion),” he added. 
Mr Abbasi’s recent remarks about PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif being the party’s candidate for prime minister’s slot (in the next general elections) were construed in the political circles as a message having been conveyed to the military establishment that there is a consensus on the nomination. 
“I had said this in the context that the party president usually is the candidate for prime minister’s slot. However, a final decision in this regard will be taken by the party leadership under its Quaid Nawaz Sharif at the time of the elections,” Mr Abbasi said, clarifying that his comment did not carry any kind of message for anyone. 
In August 2019, PTI-backed Sanjrani pulled a shock victory and survived a motion of no- confidence pushed by the opposition despite a clear disadvantage in numbers. And the Senate chairman did it again in March defeating the PDM’s Yousuf Raza Gilani for the same slot despite weaker strength of the treasury than the opposition in the house.

1,No US troops to be punished over deadly Kabul drone strike,"“What if the US had lost a child? What would the reaction have been?” asks man who lost his daughter, brother and six others.","WASHINGTON: The Pentagon said on Monday that no US troops or officials would face disciplinary action for a drone strike in Kabul in August that left 10 Afghan civilians dead, including seven children.
Spokesman John Kirby said Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin had received a high-level review of the strike that made no recommendation of accountability.
“There was not a strong enough case to be made for personal accountability,” Kirby said.
Aimal Ahmadi, 32, who lost his three-year-old daughter, his brother and six nephews and nieces in the strike, expressed anger at the decision on Tuesday.
“God will take revenge,” Ahmadi said, adding “what if the US had lost a child? What would the reaction have been?” The Taliban urged Washington to reverse the decision, with a spokesman saying the US should punish the culprits and compensate the victims.
The August 29 drone strike took place in the final days of the US-led evacuation of Kabul after the Taliban seized control of the country.
US officials said they had intelligence of a possible Islamic State attack on the evacuation operations at Kabul airport, and launched a missile from a drone at a target that was thought to be a car laden with munitions.
In fact, they struck a family that included an Afghan man who worked for a US aid group and seven children.
In early November, an initial report carried out by the US Air Force inspector general, Lieutenant General Sami Said, called the strike tragic, but “an honest mistake”. The review by Central Command head General Kenneth McKenzie Jr. and Special Operations Command chief General Richard Clarke made use of Said’s report and detailed recommendations on procedures for future drone strikes.
But it made no call for anyone to be punished for the mistake.
“What we saw here was a breakdown in process, in execution and procedural events, not the result of negligence, not the result of misconduct, not the result of poor leadership,” said Kirby.
If Austin “believed... that accountability was warranted, he would certainly support those kinds of efforts,” Kirby added.
Compensation payments
The strike killed Zemari Ahmadi, an employee of US-based Nutrition and Education International, and nine members of his family.
Last month, NEI founder and president Steve Kwon called the Pentagon’s investigation into the incident “deeply disappointing and inadequate”. The Pentagon promised to pay compensation and also to help relocate family members and Afghans working for NEI overseas, but that remains stuck on determining just who qualifies, according to officials.
Kirby said they are still discussing arrangements with Kwon.

2,Chinese firm’s plea against NTDC’s bid dismissal set aside,"Due to withdrawal of the letters of credit, the NTDC had assumed that the appellant withdrew its bid.","LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) has dismissed an appeal filed by a Chinese power company against a decision of the National Transmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC) regarding non-entertainment of its bid.  
The NTDC had floated a tender for procurement of plant, design, supply, installation, testing and commissioning of 500/220/132-kilovolt Lahore north sub-station and extension at 500/220/132kV Nokhar sub-station in May this year.  
Chinese firm SepcoIII Electric Constructions Company Ltd participated in the tender by submitting its letter of bid along with its financial statement, a letter of credit promise issued by the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) and security in the form of a guarantee issued by Deutsche Bank in favour of the NTDC.  
During the evaluation process, the NTDC asked the appellant/company to furnish an unconditional credit line, as the letter of credit was conditional. The ABC was not willing to amend its letter of credit and the appellant furnished the document issued by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBCL), which later annulled its letter.  
Due to withdrawal of the letters of credit, the NTDC assumed that the appellant withdrew its bid and consequently proceeded to write a letter to Deutsche Bank seeking encashment of the bid guarantee, which was declined.  
Aggrieved by the demand of the NTDC and actions of the respondents, the Chinese company filed a writ petition in the high court. A single bench dismissed the same and the firm filed an appeal before a division bench.  
The counsel for the appellant argued that in view of settled principles of law, executive discretion must be exercised in a fair and transparent manner on the basis of a cogent reason and rationale supporting the same, and the impugned actions were based on an arbitrary exercise of the executive authority.  
He said the NTDC treated the annulment of the financial commitments by the two independent financial institutions as withdrawal of the bid by the appellant, which was against the express provisions of tender.  
However, the LHC division bench in its written order observed that during the arguments, on a query about the appellant’s preparedness to furnish a third letter of credit from a bank, the counsel gave a vague reply and expressed no intent of the appellant to furnish a fresh, unconditional document.  
The bench noted that the appellant without raising any objection to the NTDC’s demand to furnish an unconditional letter of credit submitted a second document from another bank. The respondents firmly disclosed that after the annulment of the second letter by the bank concerned and the appellant’s intentional failure to submit a third unconditional letter, the appellant was, prime facie, not interested in performing its obligations and honouring its commitments as per the requirements of bid documents, the bench said.  
The appellant company withdrew its bid and only filed the writ petition as well as instant appeal to seek protection from the encashment of the bank guarantee, said the verdict authored by Justice Masud Abid Naqvi.  
The bench also observed: “Violation of a contract or failure to abide by the terms and conditions mentioned therein or to honour obligations arising out of an agreement cannot be decided in exercise of constitutional jurisdiction.”  
It further remarked that the superior courts should not involve themselves in investigations of disputed question of fact that necessitated taking of evidence. This could more appropriately be done in the ordinary civil procedure for litigation by a suit, it added.  
Dismissing the appeal, the bench observed that the case law referred by the counsel for the appellant was not applicable in the case.  
Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan was the other member of the division bench.

3,Winter vacations from Dec 25 to Jan 4,ISLAMABAD: A conference of federal and provincial secretaries on Tuesday decided that winter vacations would begin ...,"ISLAMABAD: A conference of federal and provincial secretaries on Tuesday decided that winter vacations would begin on Dec 25 and end on Jan 4.  
“Federal and provincial secretaries met today. The agreed proposal was that winter holidays should be from Dec 25 to Jan 4. Further notifications will be made by the governments concerned,” federal Education Minister Shafqat Mahmood tweeted on Tuesday.  
The conference, chaired by federal education secretary Naheed S. Durrani and virtually attended by all education secretaries of the provinces, urged all provinces and textbook boards to ensure publication of the country’s new political map.  
Before the tweet of the federal education minister, a press release issued by the education ministry had said that issue of winter vacations would be decided after a meeting of the National Command and Operation Centre which would be held on Wednesday.  
However, the federal education minister announced that winter vacations would begin from Dec 25.  
Sindh government has already announced winter vacations in all educational institutions in the province from Dec 20 to January 3.  
The PTI government had on August 4 last year unveiled the country’s new political map, essentially asserting its longstanding position on Kashmir and Sir Creek disputes.  
Prime Minister Imran Khan, while introducing the map at a ceremony, had said the map reflected the national aspirations and supported the principled stance on the Kashmir dispute.  
The new map was made public a day before Pakistan observed the first anniversary of annexation of occupied Kashmir. 
India annexed the held territory on August 5, 2019, by revoking articles 370 and 35A of its constitution, which had provided special status to occupied Kashmir and rights and privileges to Kashmiris.  
The map clearly identifies occupied Kashmir as a “disputed territory” and states that the final status will be decided in line with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions.

6,Belarus hands opposition leader’s husband 18 years in prison,Five other opposition activists sentenced to lengthy prison terms of 14 to 16 years.,"KYIV: A court in Belarus on Tuesday sentenced the husband of the country’s opposition leader to 18 years in prison, six months after the trial began behind closed doors. The charges against Siarhei Tsikhanouski included organising mass unrest and inciting hatred and have been widely seen as politically motivated.
Five other opposition activists were sentenced to lengthy prison terms of 14 to 16 years alongside Tsikhanouski.
Tsikhanouski, 43, a popular video blogger and activist, planned to challenge authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko in the August 2020 presidential election. He was widely known for the anti-Lukashenko slogan Stop the cockroach. He was arrested in May 2020, two days after he declared his candidacy.
His wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, ran in his stead, drawing tens of thousands of people to rally in her support during the campaign. Official results of the vote handed Lukashenko a landslide victory and a sixth term in office, but were denounced by opposition and the West as a sham.
The results triggered a months-long wave of unprecedented mass protests, the largest of which saw some 200,000 people taking to the streets of the Belarusian capital of Minsk. Lukashenko’s government unleashed a violent crackdown on the demonstrators, arresting more than 35,000 and brutally beating thousands.
Tsikhanouskaya fled the country to Lithuania a day after the vote under pressure from the authorities. Other key opposition figures have also left the country, while some have ended up behind bars.
In recent months, pressure has mounted on Belarus non-governmental organisations, activists and journalists, with the authorities regularly conducting mass raids and detentions of those they suspect of supporting the anti-government protests. The majority of independent media outlets and rights groups in Belarus have now been shut down.
Commenting on the verdict in her husband’s case, Tsikhanouskaya told The Associated Press that the dictator publicly retaliates against his strongest opponents, they’re being repressed for their desire to live in a free Belarus.
“We will not stop and will continue the fight with the dictatorship in the centre of Europe,” Tsikhanouskaya, who raises two children, added. “I don’t have the right to tell my children that they won’t see their father for so many years, because I don’t believe it myself.”
Siarhei Tsikhanouski has already spent 20 months behind bars. His trial was shrouded in secrecy, with court hearings held behind closed doors and lawyers bound by non-disclosure agreements.
State media showed a tired-looking Tsikhanouski being led into the closed hearing, along with other defendants who include Mikola Statkevich, who ran against Lukashenko in 2010 and was sentenced to six years in prison after demonstrations broke out following that election. Statkevich was arrested again in May 2020 and on Tuesday was sentenced to 14 years in prison.
Another popular blogger who also stood trial alongside Tsikhanouski, 29-year-old Ihar Losik, was handed a 15-year sentence. Losik was holding a hunger strike in jail to protest his prosecution.
US ambassador to Belarus Julie Fisher said on Twitter that it is clear whom the regime most fears.
The United States, alongside our partners, will continue efforts to secure the unconditional release of all political prisoners, including Siarhei Tsikhanouski, Ihar Losik and all those facing unjust detention and vengeful verdicts, she wrote.
