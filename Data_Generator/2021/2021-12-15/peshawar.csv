Addressing a joint news conference at the Peshawar Press Club on Tuesday, ANP provincial spokesperson Samar Haroon Bilour and JUI-F leaders — former district nazim Haji Ghulam Ali and former provincial minister Maulana Amanullah Haqqani — termed the police move a bid by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government to rig the local government polls by restricting the visits of opposition parties’ candidates to different polling stations on the Election Day.
Samar Bilour, who is also a member of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, alleged that the government had paralysed the Election Commission of Pakistan and issued its own code of conduct for the elections through police in order to restrict movement of candidates of opposition parties.
“Police have issued a form to be filled in by the candidates that they will not visit the polling stations on the Election Day. The candidates will have to inform the local police two hours prior to their visit to any place,” she said.
The ANP spokesperson said in case the candidates’ movement to the polling stations was restricted then how they would be able to observe the violations in the election process. She said ECP won’t be able to fold free, fair and impartial elections in the prevailing situation.

4,"PHC seeks reports on river bed mining, hotel construction on forest land","Orders early filling of top EPA, GDA vacancies","PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Tuesday directed the relevant authorities to produce reports on the illegal sand excavation from the bed of the Kunhar River in Mansehra, the construction of a hotel on Nathiagali forestland, and encroachments along major rivers in the province.
A bench consisting of Chief Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan and Justice Syed M. Attique Shah also directed them not to yield to any pressure by influential people during a crackdown on law offenders.
It also directed commissioner of the Hazara division Mutahir Zeb to examine the construction of a five-star hotel in Nathiagali area following the alleged encroachment of the land of Ayubia National Park.
The bench voiced concern about the non-appointment of officers to key posts, including that of the directors general of the KP Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Galiyat Development Authority (GDA), and ordered the early filling of those vacancies.

Orders early filling of top EPA, GDA vacancies

It fixed Jan 25 for next hearing into the matter.
In Sept this year, the court had turned down the petition of a private Chinese company to allow the excavation of sand and gravel from the bed of the Kunhar River for the Suki Kinari hydropower project in Manshera district.
The court had directed the company, Jiuzhou Hengton Machinery & Engineering Limited, to find another place for riverbed mining and inform the EPA and mines department about it.
It had issued those orders over the company’s petition for permission to excavate sand from the riverbed.
During Tuesday hearing, the high court also ordered the clubbing of that petition with the cases in question.
Few months ago, Chief Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan, while heading the Green Bench dealing with environment-related cases, had taken exception to encroachments along the River Swat, River Kunhar, River Chitral and others in the province and ordered their removal.
He had also taken notice of the alleged deforestation in parts of the province.
On Tuesday, the court observed that when any question was asked about an environment-related issue, the court was told that the relevant secretary had been transferred or the new secretary had not taken charge.
It added that several important posts had been lying vacant.
Provincial advocate general Shumail Ahmad Butt informed the bench that the government had recently appointed one of the most competent officers, Abid Majeed, as the environment secretary to effectively tackle environmental and forestry issues.
He said on the next hearing, the secretary would brief the court about initiatives taken by the government for checking environmental degradation and forest protection.
Hazara commissioner Mutahir Zeb told the bench that on the court’s orders, the administration had stopped the Chinese company from excavating sand and gravel from the riverbed and impounded machinery for that purpose and others.
He said the company had claimed that it had received an NOC from the mining department for the purpose, but it failed to produce that.
The commissioner said the company was excavation around 30,000 tons of sand and gravel from the bed of the River Kunhar for the execution of the Suki Kinaru project, but the action by the administration led to the suspension of excavation.
He added that the administration was also acting against other violators of the law.
The chief justice observed that the Chinese company had been acting like the East India Company and was damaging natural resources of the country.
He wondered why the relevant officers had turned a blind eye towards the illegal activities of that company.
The bench was told that the top GDA post was vacant after the high court’s Abbottabad Circuit Bench declared the appointment of the last chief illegal.
The bench observed that an FIR should have been registered against that DG as he had remained silent on the felling of precious forests in Ayubia for building a hotel.
It asked the Hazara commissioner not to be pressured by anyone during the crackdown on lawbreakers.
The AG said both high court and provincial government shared the same objective of checking environment-related problems and for that reason, the government fully endorsed the orders issued by the court in that respect.
The chief justice observed that the court won’t allow the tourism development through deforestation and environmental degradation.

6,LG polls: Tough PTI-ANP contest likely in Swabi's Razaar tehsil,ANP leaders say that record inflation and the falling popularity of the ruling party are boosting points for them.,"SWABI: A leading industrialist of the district contesting local government elections on the ticket of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Biland Iqbal and Awami National Party’s former tehsil nazim Ghulam Haqqani are locked in a tough contest for Razaar tehsil chairman slot and both have been claiming to emerge victorious in the Dec 19 local government elections. 
Momin Shah of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl,Mohammad Farooq of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and Akhtar Hameed of Jamaat-i-Islami are among other candidates for the tehsil top slot and their campaigns are gaining momentum. 
Contesting elections for the Razaar tehsil seat is considered a tough task as 20 of 56 union councils of the district are located in this tehsil and the candidates have to cover a wide region to secure people’s support. 
Biland Iqbal is the uncle of Shahram Khan Tarakai, the provincial minister for elementary and secondary education, and he had lost the union council nazim election in the previous LG election. On the other hand, Ghulam Haqqani had not only won the UC nazim election, but also remained the first nazim of Razaar tehsil. 
Interaction with leaders of the two parties has made it clear that they have set their eyes on the upcoming general elections and winning the tehsil chairman slot will be a great boost for any party in this regard. 
“The Tarakai family is striving to maintain its dominant position, and we are working for achieving the past glory of our party. Razaar belt is the stronghold of our party,” said ANP leader Mukhtiar Khan. 
One of senior political activists, not related to ANP, said that Ghulam Haqqani was leading the race right now. 
MNA Usman Khan Tarakai, MPA Mohammad Ali Tarakai, Shahram Tarakai and Senator Liaquat Tarakai all belong to one family. Mr Biland is part of the same family and they would try their best to ensure his win, said an independent observer. 
ANP leaders here say that record inflation and falling popularity of the ruling party are boosting points for Mr Haqqani. JUI-F, JI and PML-N leaders said their candidates had been very much in the contest and working for winning the election.

7,Man denied bail in girl assault case,PESHAWAR: A single-member Peshawar High Court bench has turned down the bail petition of a man accused of kidnapping...,"PESHAWAR: A single-member Peshawar High Court bench has turned down the bail petition of a man accused of kidnapping and sexually assaulting his minor foster sister.
Justice Lal Jan Khattak observed that the accused, Awais, a resident of Hazro area in Attock district, didn’t deserve to be extended the concession of bail.
The petitioner is charged in an FIR registered at the Charsadda police station by the father of a minor girl wherein he had charged him of kidnapping, keeping in illegal custody and raping his daughter who was aged around 15.
The complainant was represented by advocate Mehwish Muhib Kakakhel, who is also a member of the special committee constituted by the prime minister under an ordinance on rape.
Ms Mehwish said the girl went to the school on the day of the crime but didn’t return and that after five to six days, she escaped from the house of the accused and contacted her family, who recovered her afterwards.
She added that the next day, the girl recorded a statement with a judicial magistrate in Charssada nominating the accused for the offence.
The lawyer said the accused and the child were foster siblings and cousins and that the accused wanted to marry her but being foster siblings, the proposal was rejected and therefore, he kidnapped her and repeatedly raped her in confinement.
She argued that the accused faced the charge of a heinous offence, so he was not entitled to bail under the Code of Criminal Procedure.
The counsel argued that the law didn’t allow  bail to those accused of committing crimes punishable by death or life imprisonment, whereas kidnapping with the intent to compel a minor or a woman for marriage was punishable with life imprisonment.
She added that medical examination of the child proved the sexual assault.
The lawyer said the call data record of the accused’s mobile phone also supported the prosecution’s case.
She said the rape of minors was a menace, which needed to be dealt with an iron hand, and therefore, the court should deny the bail to the accused deter other criminals.

11,Home dept ordered to enhance security of  polio vaccinators,"Secretary says attacks can’t demoralise health workers, police","PESHAWAR: The government has ordered strengthening security of polio teams due to back-to-back attacks on the vaccinators resulting in the killing of eight policemen during the past three months.
“A meeting held with Chief Secretary Dr Shehzad Bangash in the chair has ordered home department to further enhance security of the polio teams to accomplish the national cause of eradicating poliomyelitis,” Health Secretary Mohammad Tahir Orakzai told Dawn. He said that there would be no backpedalling in the efforts to wipe out poliovirus in the province.
The health secretary said that police and polio workers were heroes of the people, whose security was the top priority of the government. 
He said that the meeting was also attended by IGP Moazzam Jah, who briefed the participants regarding security of the polio teams.

Secretary says attacks can’t demoralise health workers, police

Tank district, where a policeman was killed in the latest attack on the polio team, has been under the focus of authorities owing to positive sewerage water sample for poliovirus but the team encountered alleged militants in the area.
“On daily basis, we are witnessing some incidents because the policemen accompanying the teams work in different areas and the attackers search for soft targets. However, it is not going to demoralise our workers. It is evident from our achievement of zero case in the province,” said Mr Orakzai.
He said that their strategy was simple as they wanted to reach the entire target population and safeguard police and vaccinators. “We are in close contact with the police for foolproof security,” he added.
He said that only a single polio case was reported from Balochistan in the current year. “It is a marked achievement. We have to carry on polio vaccination as well as ensure protection of the health workers and police guarding them,” he said.
The crippling vaccine-preventable childhood ailment has been eradicated globally except Pakistan and Afghanistan. “We are committed to do away with the virus and make sure that our generation grow healthy,” said the health secretary.
About 40,000 police personnel have been deployed in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for the ongoing five-day polio drive started from Friday to inoculate over 6.4 million children with the help of 30,524 teams. 
The government is facing an uphill task to protect policemen and health workers from attacks, allegedly carried out by militants, who are opposed to vaccination.
In January last year, two lady health workers were murdered during a polio campaign in Swabi. A three-member committee, formed on the directives of chief minister to hold a fact-finding probe, cited security lapse as a reason of the murder of the vaccinators.
“One policeman is deputed to safeguard one polio vaccinator and the assailants often target the policeman standing in the street and run away on motorbike,” a police official said. 
He said on the condition of anonymity that such attacks happened all over the province in each district but the policemen continued to protect the vaccinators at the cost of their lives.
He said targeting polio teams was started in 2012 and about 63 people including 40 health workers and 23 policemen were killed in the incidents linked to polio vaccination in the country. Fifty per cent such incidents happened in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, he added.
So far, no statement has been issued by the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan to claim responsibility for such attacks, except the latest killings of two policemen one day apart in Tank, where the militants said that their people had killed them.
The militants banned polio vaccination in Swat in 2007. In 2012, militants banned vaccination in Waziristan briefly. Both Swat and Waziristan remained reservoirs of poliovirus subsequently.

Dozens of such stalls and kiosks of the Rabat ‘malta’ (orange) that is popular in Pakistan for its colour, taste and juice, can be seen on both sides of the main road as one enters Rabat town.
Farmanullah, a roadside vendor, while dealing with a customer from Mardan, told Dawn that people preferred to buy the Rabat orange as compared to other varieties of the fruit due to its taste and juicy nature. 
“The sale of Rabat orange begins in the start of December and continues till May,” he said, adding that it was being sold at Rs1,100 per bag containing 100 oranges.
The vendor said that the price of Rabat ‘red blood orange’ reached Rs3,500 per 100 oranges in April and May. He said that majority of the customers sent it to their relatives and friends as a gift.
Hidayatullah, another orange dealer in Rabat, said that some of the growers had started plucking the fruit while some would wait till March and April. 
He said that oranges of Palai Malakand, Timergara, Kaka Sahib and Khanpur could not compete with the Rabat orange. 
He said that besides the down districts, the fruit was also supplied to Dubai, Saudi Arabia and other countries in the winter season.
Shakir alias Ameer Sahib, another dealer, said that prolonged drought-like situation and soil erosion on the bank of the Panjkora River badly affected yield of orange in Rabat, Khall and Munjai in the current year. 
He said that quality, taste and colour of Rabat orange improved when it was left in trees till March or April.
Habibul Haq, an agriculture officer, told Dawn that the orange orchards in Lower Dir were spread over 1,200 acres in various areas that produced about 3,200 tonnes of oranges annually. 
He said that the ‘red blood orange’ of Rabat was the most popular variety.
The orange growers complained that neither the government nor the agriculture department ever helped them. They said that produce of their orchards could be improved if the government supported them. 
They said that government should take practical steps to rehabilitate the washed away orchards in the area.
