0,Pakistan looking for economic ties with US: Qureshi,FM says Islamabad-Moscow ‘trajectory contributing to stability’ in region,"ISLAMABAD: Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi has said that Pakistan desires a stable and broad-based relationship with the United States that is driven by economic interests.  
Speaking at the Margalla Dialogue hosted by Islamabad Policy Research Institute (IPRI) on Tuesday, Mr Qureshi said: “We value our longstanding relations with the United States. Looking towards the future, we do not want a transactional relationship with the US. We want multifaceted ties that are not susceptible to the vagaries of regional and international policies.”  
The foreign minister during his lecture listed Pakistan’s priorities for ties with major countries, particularly those in the region.  

FM says Islamabad-Moscow ‘trajectory contributing to stability’ in region 

Relations between Islamabad and Washington have long been troubled but turned chillier since President Joe Biden came to office earlier this year because of his experiences from his previous term as vice president. The two sides have occasionally cooperated during this period, but it is clear that Washington is keen to limit the scope of ties to dealing with Afghanistan.  
President Biden has so far not directly spoken to Prime Minister Imran Khan while Pakistan declined Washington’s invitation to the ‘Summit for Democracy’.  
Referring to the present government’s policy of prioritising geo-economics in external ties, Mr Qureshi said Pakistan wants a relationship with the US that is in sync with its changed priority.  
“Enhanced trade and investment ties with the US and cooperation in regard to regional connectivity can work to our mutual benefit,” he suggested.  
He mentioned Pakistan’s growing ties with China as an example of how geo-economics was driving Pakistan’s foreign policy. “Our relations with China are resilient and poised to grow further. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), of which the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is the flagship project, will leverage economic geography and connectivity of the three contiguous continents — Asia, Europe and Africa — ushering in prosperity for all global citizens,” he maintained.  
On expanding contacts with Moscow, the foreign minister said they “opened doors for reinvigorated relations in the security and economic realms”. “The Pak-Russia trajectory is contributing to stability in the region and we will continue to strengthen it,” he added.  
Mr Qureshi said Pakistan cannot unilaterally improve ties with India. “Pakistan’s quest for peace and geo-economic strength cannot be a solo performance. It takes two to tango,” he said while recalling that Islamabad’s peace overtures to Delhi were snubbed.  
“Our eastern neighbour chose to close all doors on any kind of talks. What’s more, it took the most drastic militaristic steps to invade and lay siege to the disputed territory of Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), disenfranchise its 14 million people and brutalise them,” he said.  
The foreign minister called on the United Nations and the international community at large to hold India accountable for its human rights abuses in occupied Kashmir. “Indian atrocities are too egregious to be masked by the veneer of secularism and democratic pretentions,” he said.

1,Govt hails ECP’s move to use EVMs for Islamabad LG polls,"Asad Umar, Zobaida Jalal to hold talks with Gwadar fishermen.","• Asad Umar, Zobaida Jalal to hold talks with Gwadar fishermen
• Visa process for officials of NGOs working in Afghanistan eased
• One year given to exchange discarded currency notes
• Minister says gas reserves depleting fast in Pakistan    
ISLAMABAD: Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry on Tuesday said the federal cabinet welcomed the decision of the Election Commission Pakistan (ECP) to use electronic voting machines (EVMs) during the local government (LG) elections in Islamabad and asked the commission to issue tender (with required specifications) for purchasing the machines.
Presided over by Prime Minister Imran Khan, the meeting was also informed that 20 million people in the country had received just one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.
To resolve the grievances of the protesting fishermen in Gwadar, the cabinet formed a committee comprising federal ministers Asad Umar and Zobaida Jalal.
The meeting approved a proposal to facilitate the officials of international NGOs involved in humanitarian activities in Afghanistan in acquiring Pakistani visas.
In a significant decision, the cabinet gave one year to change currency notes that had been discarded five years ago. Earlier, the cut-off date for their replacement was December 2016.
Fawad Chaudhry said the meeting was briefed about the introduction of EVMs and granting of voting rights to overseas Pakistanis.
“The cabinet welcomed the ECP’s decision to use electronic voting machines in the local bodies elections in Islamabad,” he said, adding that some 4,000 EVMs would be needed for LG polls in the federal capital.
“Getting 4,000 EVMs is not a big issue. Once the election commission invites tender, it will immediately get the machines of required specifications from the manufacturing companies,” he said.
The cabinet was also given a detailed briefing on the schedule of delivery and use of electronic voting machines at all polling stations in the country as well as training of staff.
The meeting expressed its firm resolve to hold the next elections through EVMs.
Gwadar fishermen issue
The information minister said the cabinet formed a two-member committee comprising Asad Umar and Zobaida Jalal, who would visit the port city of Gwadar on behalf of the prime minister and try to resolve the matter.
“They will talk to the protesters, as the prime minister has already taken notice and ordered the resolution of the issue,” Mr Chaudhry said.
According to Prime Minister Office, the meeting decided to make the process of obtaining Pakistani visas easier for officials of international NGOs.
The decision was made on humanitarian grounds and to help the people of Afghanistan.
The government will also facilitate the registration process of international NGOs working for the welfare of the Afghan people.
Similarly, the process of obtaining Pakistani visas for Afghans has been further eased and the necessary security clearance has been reduced to 15 days from 30 days.
The meeting decided to extend the facility for Afghans immigrating to other countries through Pakistan has been extended for another 60 days. The facility includes travel by land and air routes.
Vaccination process
Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health Dr Faisal Sultan gave a briefing to the cabinet members on preventive measures against Omicron — the latest Covid-19 variant affecting the entire world.
The cabinet emphasised the need to increase the pace of vaccinations, maintain social distance and wear masks.
It was also informed that at present 20 million people in the country had not received their second dose of the coronavirus vaccine.
“The cabinet appealed to all such citizens to take the second jab as soon as possible to prevent the spread of Covid-19,” Mr Chaudhry said.
Change in currency notes
The minister said the State Bank of Pakistan had sought a six-year extension to replace currency notes of Rs10, Rs50, Rs100 and Rs1,000 denominations, but the cabinet granted a period of 12 months only.
“Those who want to get currency notes changed should get it done in a year,” he said.
Interestingly, the facility is being given to those who could not change the currency notes by the cut-off date of December 2016.
Justice Wajih’s allegations
Responding to a claim of retired Justice Wajihuddin Ahmed, who resigned from the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf reportedly over differences with Prime Minister Imran Khan in September 2016, Fawad Chaudhry called him a “buffoon” and dismissed Mr Wajih’s allegations against the premier.
“Such buffoons roam around trying to seek importance in media by making such allegations. These people are not even given respect in their own homes, therefore please do not give importance to them,” the minister told mediapersons.
Justice Wajihuddin Ahmed had claimed in a recent TV show that Imran Khan used to get Rs5 million from his political aides to run his palatial hilltop house in Banigala.
Gas crisis
Mr Chaudhry warned of an impending gas crisis in the country, saying the natural resource was depleting fast and that “Pakistan will have no gas in years to come”.
He said people getting gas at cheaper rates in big cities should now change their habits. “This trend will not continue for long,” he added.
Meanwhile, the minister said the Sugar Sector Reform Committee’s report that was released on Tuesday contained several proposals, including its deregulation, to minimise the government’s role in fixing prices.
“The report will now be available for public debate before any final decision is taken,” he added.
Inflation
Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance Shaukat Tarin presented a comparative review of the prices of essential commodities to the federal cabinet and claimed that the weekly inflation rate had come down by 0.07 per cent as the cost of sugar, flour and other household items had decreased.
The cabinet was informed that apart from the prices of banaspati ghee and tea leaves in the region, rates of all other essential items were lower in Pakistan.
These items include flour, gram, dal mash, dal moong, tomato, onion, chicken and petrol.
The cabinet, however, expressed its concerns over the high prices of essential commodities in Sindh.
Among other decisions, the meeting approved an amendment to the bilateral air route between Pakistan and Tajikistan. This will reduce both air distance and travel costs.
Similarly, Kazakh Air Company was also allowed to start operations between Pakistan and Kazakhstan, with an aim to provide direct air travel between both countries and also boost bilateral trade.
To promote trade between Pakistan and the Central Asian countries, the cabinet directed the Aviation Division to finalise air travel agreements with these countries.
It also approved an amendment to air travel agreement between Pakistan and Iraq for increasing commercial flights between them.
Meanwhile, the cabinet was told that there was no shortage of urea in the country. However, to ensure its supply for the Rabi crop, the Sui Northern Gas Company will supply gas to plants by January 2022. Gas will also be supplied to Pak Arab and Fatima Fertiliser plants while the process of importing additional 50,000 tonnes of urea would be completed expeditiously, the meeting was informed.
The cabinet was told that a sack of urea in Pakistan was available for about Rs1,864 while in other countries it was being sold at Rs10,000 per sack.
The meeting was also informed that the country had petrol and diesel stock for 27 days.
Meanwhile, the information minister said 75 exploration licences had been awarded and revenue of Rs29 billion generated.
He said the meeting stressed the need to ensure safety standards of LPG cylinders and ordered action against those selling petrol at illegal pumps or in plastic containers.

2,SC puts onus on ex-judge’s counsel to disprove misconduct,ISLAMABAD: The Sup­reme Court directed the counsel for former Islam­abad High Court (IHC) judge Shaukat Aziz...,"ISLAMABAD: The Sup­reme Court directed the counsel for former Islam­abad High Court (IHC) judge Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui on Tuesday to satisfy the bench whether criticising a spy agency and his own institution was not contradictory to judges’ code of conduct.  
A five-member bench of the apex court — headed by Justice Umar Ata Bandial — resumed hearing on Mr Siddiqui’s petition against the proceedings of the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) and his subsequent sacking in the wake of a speech he delivered in 2018.  
Hamid Khan, Mr Siddi­qui’s counsel, argued that two members of the SJC — former chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) Saqib Nisar and senior puisne judge Justice Asif Saeed Khosa — were biased against the former IHC judge.  
Justice Bandial questioned the speech made by Mr Siddiqui in which he openly criticised the judiciary and the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). Justice Bandial said that such a matter should have been taken up with the chief justice.  
Mr Khan responded that Mr Siddiqui had repeatedly requested the then CJP Nisar for a meeting, but his requests had been turned down. Subsequently, he delivered the speech at Rawalpindi’s District Bar Association in July 2018, he added.  
In that speech, the former judge accused the ISI of manipulating judicial proceedings and using its influence for constituting benches of its choice to obtain favourable judgements.  
During the hearing, Justice Bandial asked why Mr Siddiqui did not produce any evidence of such interference before the SJC.  
Mr Khan argued that under the set practice, an inquiry should have been constituted before the SJC started the proceedings against Mr Siddiqui. He insisted that Mr Siddiqui was put on trial without being inquired.  
Justice Bandial pointed out that there was no need of conducting an inquiry in disciplinary proceedings. He, however, offered the counsel to prepare arguments on this aspect as well as the code of conduct of a judge.  
The hearing has been adjourned until January.

3,NCOC allows Pakistanis to return from Category C countries,ISLAMABAD: The Natio­nal Command and Opera­tion Centre (NCOC) on Tuesday allowed Pakistanis to travel inbound from...,"ISLAMABAD: The Natio­nal Command and Opera­tion Centre (NCOC) on Tuesday allowed Pakistanis to travel inbound from category C countries. 
Meanwhile, 25 per cent of total population and 37pc of vaccine-eligible population of Pakistan has been inoculated. 
To facilitate stranded passengers, a meeting of the NCOC decided to allow Pak­istanis, including NICOP/POC holders, to travel inbound from category C countries till December 31. However, vaccination certificate, pre-boarding (maximum 48 hours old) PCR test and mandatory quarantine for travellers from Omicron-hit countries will remain applicable. 
Moreover, as vaccination of people between 15 and 18 years of age has not begun in a few countries, mandatory full vaccination for inbound passengers of this age group has been exten­ded till January 31, 2022. 
After emergence of Omi­cron variant of coronavirus, the NCOC had announced on December 6 that there were 15 countries in category C list and there would be a ban on inbound travel from there. Countries placed in category C are the Neth­erlands, Hungary, Ukraine, Ireland, Zimbabwe, Slove­nia, Vietnam, Poland, Croatia, South Africa, Mozambique, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini and Botswana. 
As many as 13 countries were placed in category B, including the US, United Kingdom, Germany, Azerbaijan, Mexico, Sri Lanka, Russia, Thailand, France, Afghanistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Austria and Turkey. Remaining all countries were placed in A category. 
Inbound patients from countries in C category have to follow NCOC guidelines which also include compulsory quarantine. Inbound passengers from category B countries need 100pc vaccination, PCR test and rapid antigen test (RAT) at airport and passengers from category A list need to clear RAT. 
The data regarding vaccination shows that as many as 25pc of the total population of Pakistan, i.e. over 220 million, and 37pc of vaccine eligible population has become fully vaccinated. Overall 134,818,017 doses of vaccine have been administered. 
Meanwhile, 250 new Covid-19 cases and three deaths were reported in last 24 hours with positivity rate of 0.67pc. The number of active cases was 9,120 out of which 773 patients were admitted to hospitals as of December 14. 
The data shows that 3,342 ventilators are available across the country out of which 1,518 have been allocated for Covid-19 patients. However, only 71 ventilators were being used by Covid-19 patients across the country on Tuesday and occupancy was 5pc.

4,Interest rate hiked by 100bps to 9.75pc,SBP governor insists there won’t be 13pc rate-like situation in future.,"• Central bank revises upwards targets for inflation, current account deficit
• Notes recent rise in govt auction yields appears unwarranted
• SBP governor insists there won’t be 13pc rate-like situation in future    
KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Tuesday increased the policy interest rate by 100 basis points to 9.75 per cent and revised targets for inflation, current account deficit and growth rate and changed perception about the rising import bill.  
While announcing the decision, the SBP explained that the policy rate was raised “to counter the inflationary pressure and ensure that growth remains stable”. “The MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) expects monetary policy settings to remain broadly unchanged in the near term,” the SBP said, adding that the end goal of mildly positive real interest rate on a forward-looking basis was now close to being achieved.  
Meanwhile, in an interview with Geo News, SBP Governor Dr Reza Baqir assured that there would be no 13pc interest rate-like situation in future because this time “we have been taking timely corrective measures”. Earlier, he added, the interest rate had risen to over 13pc due to a crisis as the current account deficit was more than $19 billion in the year 2018.  
The SBP said that since the last MPC meeting despite a moderation in consumer loans, the overall credit growth has remained supportive of growth. Meanwhile, across all tenors secondary market  yields benchmark rates and cut-off rates in the government’s auctions  have risen significantly. The MPC noted that this increase appeared  unwarranted.
The SBP said the momentum in inflation had continued since the last meeting, as reflected in a significant increase in both headline and core inflation in November. “Due to recent higher than expected outturns, SBP expects inflation to average 9-11 per cent this fiscal year,” it said, adding that the pickup in inflation had been broad-based, with electricity charges, motor fuel, house rent, milk and vegetable ghee among the largest contributors.  
The State Bank also changed its assessment for current account deficit as the target for the current fiscal year (FY22) is in the range of 2-3pc of GDP. “Due to the higher recent outturns, the current account deficit is projected at around 4pc of GDP, somewhat higher than earlier projected,” it said.  
While in the near term monthly current account and trade deficit figures are likely to remain high, they are expected to gradually moderate in the second half of FY22 as global prices normalise with the easing of supply disruptions and tightening of monetary policy by major central banks, it added.  
The SBP looks satisfied with the recent data releases which confirmed that the emphasis of monetary policy on moderating inflation and the current account deficit remained appropriate.  
“The current account deficit is expected to be fully financed from external inflows,” said the SBP, adding that as a result foreign exchange reserves should remain at adequate levels through the rest of the fiscal year and resume their growth trajectory as global commodity prices ease and import demand moderates.  
Since the last MPC meeting on Nov 19, indicators of activity have remained robust while inflation and trade deficit have risen further due to both high global prices and domestic economic growth, it said.  
In November, headline inflation increased to 11.5 per cent year-on-year. Core inflation in urban and rural areas also rose to 7.6pc and 8.2pc, respectively, reflecting domestic demand growth. On the external side, despite record exports, high global commodity prices contributed to a significant increase in the import bill, the SBP said.  
“As a result, November trade deficit rose to $5 billion. The growth this fiscal year is expected to be close to the upper end of the forecast range of 4-5pc,” it added.  
High-frequency indicators of domestic demand released since the last MPC meeting, including electricity generation, cement dispatches, and sales of fast-moving consumer goods and petroleum products, and continued strength in imports and tax revenues suggest that economic growth remains robust.  
“A robust growth in sales tax on services also suggests that the sector is recovering well,” said the SBP, adding that this projection factored in the expected impact of Tuesday’s interest rate decision. “Around 70 per cent of this increase in imports stems from a sharp rise in global commodity prices, while the rest is attributable to stronger domestic demand,” it added.  
Despite strong exports and remittances, the current account deficit has increased sharply this year due to a rise in imports while recent outturns have been higher than earlier expected. Based on this momentum and the expected path of energy tariffs, inflation is likely to remain within the revised forecast range for the remainder of the fiscal year, said the SBP.  
Subsequently, as global commodity prices retrench, administered price increases dissipate and the impact of demand-moderating policies materialises, inflation is expected to decline towards the medium-term target range of 5-7pc during FY23, it added.  
The SBP said the government intended to introduce legislation to increase revenues through elimination of certain tax exemptions and reduce current and development expenditures. These measures would help moderate domestic demand, improve the current account outlook and complement recent monetary policy actions, it added.
