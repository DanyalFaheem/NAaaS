0,"Rao Anwar was present at site of staged encounter, IO tells court",Defence will cross-examine SSP Rizwan Ahmed on Jan 3 in Naqeeb murder case.,"KARACHI: An antiterrorism court was informed on Tuesday that the then SSP Rao Anwar was present at the place where young Naqeebullah Mehsood and three other captives were killed in a “fake” encounter.
SSP Dr Rizwan Ahmed, the second investigating officer of the high-profile case, deposed this before the ATC-III judge as a prosecution witness.
Ex-SSP Anwar along with his around two dozen subordinates has been charged with killing Naqeeb, Sabir, Nazar Jan and Ishaq in a staged encounter after dubbing them as ‘Taliban militants’ on Jan 13, 2018.
While recording his statement, SSP Rizwan deposed that the call data record (CDR) and geo-fencing of the cell phone of the then Malir SSP Rao Awan had shown him present on the crime scene between 2.41am till 5:18am on Jan 13, 2018.

Defence will cross-examine SSP Rizwan on Jan 3 in Naqeeb murder case

Earlier, Rao Anwar’s presence around the New Sabzi Mandi police post was also recorded on Jan 4, 5, 8 and 9, 2018. Naqeeb and others were kept in unlawful detention at the police post, the IO added.
He testified that the CDR and geo-fencing had further revealed the presence of other police officials including Shakeel Feroz, Azhar and Amanullah Marwat at the crime scene a day before the staged encounter took place.
He said that in the light of the statements of the witnesses recorded under Section 161 of the criminal procedure code (CrPC) the police officials were found involved in commissioning of the offence alleged on them.
After recording his statement, the judge fixed the matter for Jan 3, 2022 for cross-examination of SSP Rizwan Ahmed by the defence.
According to the prosecution, the undertrial police officials had kidnapped Naqeeb and three others for ransom and later killed them in a fake encounter and dubbed them as militants.
The killing of the 27-year-old aspirant model from South Waziristan had sparked widespread protests by the civil society and the then Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar took suo motu notice of the killings.
Contrary to Rao Anwar’s claim that the victims were militants, the trial court declared Naqeeb and other victims as “innocent” and quashed the cases filed against them.
In March 2019, an ATC had indicted Anwar and others policemen for the murder of four victims in fake encounter and labelling them as militants and foisting fake recoveries of weapons and explosives on the victims.
Seven other policemen, including Amanullah Marwat, Shaikh Muhammad Shoaib, Gada Hussain, Mohsin Abbas, Sadaqat Hussain Shah, Rana Shamim and Riaz, have been declared proclaimed offenders and warrants have been out for their arrests.

1,Ex-policeman jailed for life in acid attack case in Karachi,The judge also imposed a fine of Rs1 million on the convict.,"KARACHI: A sessions court on Tuesday sentenced a former policeman to life in prison for wounding his ex-fiancée in an acid attack to avenge the refusal to his marriage proposal in 2015.
Zeeshan Umar alias Ali was found guilty of attacking 19-year-old Raheela Raheem, her brother and nephew on July 5, 2015 in Mobina Town. However, the court acquitted co-accused Agha Sohrab for want of evidence.
On Tuesday, Additional District and Sessions Judge (East) Javed Hyder Phulpoto pronounced his verdict reserved after recording evidence and final arguments. The trial took six years to conclude.
The judge also imposed a fine of Rs1 million on the convict.
Complainant’s counsel Salahuddin Panhwar said that according to the prosecution, accused Umar and Raheela got engaged in 2015, but they broke up after a couple of months as her family considered him (Umar) a mugger.
He said on the day of the incident, which is a day before Eid, the victim had gone to a local market to get henna applied on her hands. She was standing outside her house carrying her six-month-old nephew, Muhammad Hadi, when accused Umar suddenly emerged there and threw acid on her and the little kid.
The attack had completely burnt her face and she lost one eye while her nephew also suffered serious burns, the added.
The counsel said that as the accused was a police constable the victim had to leave Karachi and move to Islamabad due to the threats. Besides, the accused had also attempted to influence the investigation of the case.
In 2017, the Supreme Court had ordered the police to provide security to the victim and her family, the counsel pointed out and added that they still needed security since the police high-ups had failed to comply with the apex court’s directives.

2,Sindh's medical colleges told to initiate admissions process,Health Minister Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho stresses the provincial govt will resist moves by PMC through legal means.,"KARACHI: Sindh Health Minister Dr Azra Fazal Pechuhu on Tuesday asked the heads of medical institutions in the province to start the admission process in the light of a provincial cabinet’s decision regarding the eligibility criteria of admission to medical and dental colleges. 
Amid a deadlock between the provincial and federal governments over the eligibility criteria, Dr Pechuhu emphasised that the provincial government would resist moves by the Pakistan Medical Commission (PMC) through legal means. 
She was chairing a meeting with the heads of private medical colleges and universities. 
Talking to the participants, the minister said admission to medical colleges and universities in Sindh would be given on the basis of minimum 50 per cent pass percentage in MDCAT (medical and dental college admission test) and that the government would resist the PMC through legal means. 
“Since a notification about the cabinet’s decision has already been issued, you can start the admission process. We will set up a Sindh medical and dental council and get it recognised from the WHO and other institutions,” she said. 
The government was standing with medical colleges and would provide them with legal support if needed, she added. 
The minister expressed the desire that maximum students would be enrolled in institutions and no medical seat would be left vacant. 
“Candidates having Sindh’s domicile would be given preference in the admission process. In the next stage, preference would be given to students from Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Kashmir and Balochistan,” she told the participants. 
The meeting decided that a university from the public sector would be selected to oversee the admission process at private medical colleges and universities as well as deal with legal matters with respect to the PMC. 
The meeting was informed that there were a total of 29 private medical institutions: 17 medical and 12 dental colleges. 
The PMC, the national regulator for medical and dental education, had turned down the Sindh government’s request to reduce the minimum pass percentage from 65pc to 50pc for admission to MBBS/BDS courses in the province. 
The PMC had warned that the commission would not register students who would get admission to institutions on the basis of less than 65pc marks in the MDCAT.

3,Doctors resume work at Sindh's OPDs,"""In our late-night talks, the government accepted almost all our demands,” says Dr Faizan Memon of Young Doctors Association.","KARACHI: Out-patient-departments (OPDs) at public sector hospitals across the province finally opened on Tuesday following successful negotiations between junior doctors and government officials.
The OPDs remained closed for more than a week due to junior doctors’ boycott of patient services.
“We worked in the OPDs but also observed a black day as well against yesterday’s police action. In our late-night talks, the government accepted almost all our demands,” said Dr Faizan Memon of Young Doctors Association-Sindh, adding that the government had issued a notification on relevant matters that had led to the protest.
The deadlock, he pointed out, was over regularisation of Covid-19 doctors. “The government officials have assured us that this issue would be sorted out in a technical way as it has legal implications. We are told that these doctors would be hired on a six-month contract basis till this matter is resolved permanently else we will resume our boycott.”

4,Opposition scales up drive against controversial Sindh local govt bill,Political parties announce strategies to foil PPP’s plan to enforce ‘dictatorship’ in Sindh.,"KARACHI: Building up their momentum against the recently passed Sindh Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2021, opposition parties in Sindh on Tuesday vowed to challenge the new law at all available forums.  
While the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf sought intervention from the president of Pakistan to safeguard peoples’ rights in the province, the Pak Sarzameen Party called for constitutional amendments to fix the problem once and for all and Jamaat-i-Islami vowed to take to streets on Dec 19 to stage a protest against the ‘black law’. 
PTI approaches Alvi
Leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh wrote a letter to President Dr Arif Alvi seeking his role against what he called human rights violation in Sindh and the recent ‘violation’ of the Constitution by the ruling PPP, which led to the passing of the local government bill.  
“On 26 Nov, 2021, a bill with certain amendments to the Sindh Local Government Act 2013 was got passed without presenting and referring it to the standing committee for necessary consultation,” said the letter appealing to the president to take urgent notice of this ‘alarming’ situation and take steps as per Constitution to up hold the supremacy of the Constitution.  

Political parties announce strategies to foil PPP’s plan to enforce ‘dictatorship’ in Sindh 

“This is a clear violation of Rule 99 of Sindh Assembly Rules of Business. Furthermore, not the said amendments but the Sindh Local Govt Act 2013 by itself is a serious violation and against the spirit of Articles 140-A, 7, 8 and 32. All opposition parties in the Assembly of Sindh and outside the House have rejected such amendments and Sindh Local Govt Act 2013 as a whole.” 
PSP accuses PPP of fomenting ‘hatred’
While accusing the PPP of igniting the politics of ‘hatred’, PSP chairman Mustafa Kamal demanded an apology from the Sindh chief minister for his remarks and sought immediate amendments to the Constitution so no one could exploit 18th Amendment and deny due rights to local governments.  
“We have come up with a three-point solution to get Pakistan out of this crisis, including Karachi,” he said while addressing a press conference at the party headquarters. PSP president Anis Kaimkhani and others were also present.
“There is an urgent need for three constitutional amendments to the constitution. The first amendment is that the powers and departments of mayors, like the prime minister and chief ministers, should be written in the constitution. The second amendment is that the money received from the National Finance Commission (NFC) award should be devolved to districts through a provincial finance commission (PFC) and the NFC award should not be launched until the province paid the money to the districts through the PFC.  
“The third amendment is that Pakistan will not have elections to the National and Provincial Assemblies until a local government council is formed.” 
JI’s power show on 19th
The JI on the other hand announced that it would stage a ‘power show’ on December 19 and organise a rally titled ‘Save Karachi March’ which would be attended by prominent individuals from all walks of life.  
He accused the PPP of deliberately promoting ethnicity for political gains after losing all real credibility among the masses.  
“They [PPP] know they can’t go into masses for vote in the name of performance,” said JI Karachi chief Hafiz Naeem ur Rahman while addressing a press conference at Idara Noor-e-Haq.  
“So they are left with no other option, but to use hatred and ethnicity. They want to spread it and use all machinery of the government and even the Sindh Assembly for this dirty politics. But we warn them that the people of Sindh can no longer be fooled. The ruling regime in fact believes in dictatorship and the same way it got the bill passed by the assembly without showing it to all legislators. The PPP has become a party of feudalism and getting into the assembly with the support of feudal lords wouldn’t constitute a democracy.” 
Notice on Sindh CM’s threat
Meanwhile, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement Pakistan (MQM-P) reiterated its demand from the state institutions to take notice of the Sindh chief minister’s threat from the floor of the provincial assembly when during an address he had said that the people of Sindh would look for ‘other options’ if they were forced.  
“This certain mindset is actually a threat to the sovereignty of the country,” said senior deputy convenor of the party Amir Khan while addressing a press conference.  
“Only for political gains and to make the wrong, right and use assembly to pass the black law and to get control of all resources and finances of the urban centre, the PPP and Sindh CM have crossed all limits and started threatening the state and its sovereignty. We at the same time were surprised by the reaction from the state and waited with hope that it would sooner or later take notice of this mindset.”

5,Children’s Learning Festival opens with fanfare,The three-day event will conclude tomorrow,"KARACHI: The three-day Children’s Learning Festival (CLF) commenced at the Arts Council of Pakistan here on Tuesday with the same motto of its organisers Idara-e-Taleem-o-Aagahi to see a book, other than a course book, in children’s hands and of learning and teaching others.
Speaking to his huge audience of children from various schools at the inaugural ceremony, Sindh Information Minister Saeed Ghani, who is the chief guest on the occasion, said that he himself does not come from a highly educated background and yet he got to where he is today thanks to enabling himself through education.
“My grandparents were not educated people. Both my grandfather and grandmother used to work in the fields but they sent their son to school. And then my father sent me to school. I am the second generation in my family who is educated. And I did not take my education for granted. I studied very hard and I worked very hard too and it is thanks to my hard work that I am a minister today. If I could do it, so can you. You only need commitment,” he said. 
28 books translated into Sindhi launched
On the occasion a set of some 28 children’s books, all adaptations, translated into Sindhi were also launched. In fact, there were several other book launches as the day progressed such as Amber aur Kashif ka Khel penned by Nepalese author Una Ilapin, Sadequain, a graphic storybook, and Khoo-Khoo-Khoo: Khaansta Sheher both by Rumana Husain. There was also Aik Sabaq Seekha by Aminah Alavi. There were also readings and discussions on books such as Amai and Shabnam, a book about inclusion by Fauzia Minallah along with many storytelling sessions of which the interactive sessions by the Naunehal magazine team were the most absorbing. 

The three-day event will conclude tomorrow

More interactive sessions included a bookmaking session for children of age five to 12 in the ‘Fahmida Riaz ki Baithak’, which happened to be right outside the main auditorium, labelled by the CLF as the ‘Bhittai Auditorium’. 
They had also labelled the open air theatre of the Arts Council as the ‘Sohail Rana Open Air Theatre’, the stalls area as the ‘Jamshed Nusse­rwanjee Mehta Courtyard’, the eating area or food court as ‘Burnes Road’ just like the other areas were called ‘Sadequain ki Gali’, ‘Moejodaro’, ‘Anita Ghulam Ali Ilm Jo Vehro’, etc. 
The children were also treated to a science show and inclusive sessions organised by the Deaf Reach School and Kazim Trust. There were also activities such as arts and crafts workshops. 
Among so many other things, children were also treated to a play Jungle Jungle Zindabad by Sheema Kermani’s Tehrik-e-Niswan theatre group. It was a beautiful production of two jungle animals, an elephant and a partridge, which see in the newspaper that some humans had an eye on their jungle. Suddenly, they are concerned about their environment. They are afraid that the humans will cut down the trees in the jungle for firewood and they will make dams over their rivers. They motivate other animals to join them as they head to the city to confront whoever has such plans.

Education without etiquette is useless
A conversation with Zehra Nigah, Dr Arfa Syeda Zehra and Mehtab A. Rashdi turned out to be an engaging discussion on literature, language and etiquette. 
Poet Zehra Nigah recalled her childhood days when they had just moved to Pakistan and were living in a house without doors and windows. 
“It was my mother’s faith that we had nothing to fear in our new and free country and her patience that saw us through those initial days,” she said. 
“I have seen both hardship and comfort when I was little but I didn’t complain or become pompous. My brothers and sisters and I respected our elders who taught us a lot about life. There was a relative of ours who was also living with us. Before eating her meals she would feel half of her bread to the birds of the tree under which she had placed her bed. She said the birds were her neighbours and that she couldn’t greedily eat her food with her hungry neighbours watching her. She taught us that sharing was caring,” she said. 
She added that today’s fast-paced life has seen many families living away from their family elders so children are deprived of such little lessons of life and values from them. Still, there are the books, which are one’s best friends. “They tell you so much without asking for anything in return,” she said. 
Academic and language expert Dr Arfa Syeda Zehra said that what she was taught in her childhood by her elders she still carries with her. “Education is useless if you are not taught etiquette along with it,” she said. 
“In our day, children were seen not heard. They would learn how to speak well by listening to others,” she said, while also adding that she was a naughty child growing up but that didn’t mean that she was insolent. 
The Children’s Learning Festival concludes on Thursday (tomorrow).

6,Harris Khalique’s poetry collection launched,KARACHI: Renowned writer and poet Harris Khalique’s sixth collection of Urdu poems titled Hairaan Sar-i-Bazaar was...,"KARACHI: Renowned writer and poet Harris Khalique’s sixth collection of Urdu poems titled Hairaan Sar-i-Bazaar was launched at the Karachi Press Club (KPC) on Monday evening. 
Waheed Noor, who moderated the event, said he’s someone who’s been close to Khalique [for a long time] and knows that the poet honours relationships. He is also connected with his times (apney ahd se judey huay hain). 
Journalist Mujahid Barelvi said poetry is not his domain but he could talk about the personality of the poet. Khalique belongs to the tribe that Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Habib Jalib and Fahmida Riyaz belonged to — he is secretary general of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP). In his poetry he chooses subjects such as missing persons, which is not an easy thing to do. 
Playwright Bee Gul recited three poems from the book: Gumshuda, Nadim Ahsan and Eshwar Kumar. 
Akram Baloch, representing the KPC, thanked the guests for coming to the event. He said he knows Khalique since 1992 when the latter worked for NGORC, and both share ideological ideas. 
Harris Khalique then came to the podium and read out a few of his ghazals and nazms from the book. He began with the following opening lines of the ghazal: 
Ay chashm-i-intizar, safaid-o-siyaah-o-surkh
Be khwaab be qaraar, safaid-o-siyaah-o-surkh 
[Oh the eye that awaits (the beloved) — white, black and red Sans dreams and peace — white, black and red] 
Artiste Khalid Ahmed also recited a couple of poems the first of which was Rashida Domini. 
Writer Noorul Huda Shah said newness or freshness (jiddat) in poetry is something that’s right in front of you. It’s no mean feat to make your mark in a realm which is studded with big names. Khalique’s poems have stories and characters. 
Poetess Zehra Nigah, presiding over the launch, started her speech by lauding the prefaces (deebachey) in the book and then appreciated its title, which has the word hairaan (astonishment or wonderment). She argued one of the special aspects of poetry is that it has the element of wonderment. She told that audience, which had packed the KPC hall, she is, these days, collecting verses (asha’ar) which contain the very word in it. 
Ms Nigah, highlighting the salient features of Khalique’s poems, said there are two kinds of scenography, or image-making (manzar kashi): one carries details, for example in qasidas; and the other can be found in ghazals. Khalique’s poetry has image-making, wonderment, history and characterisation (kirdar nigari). It is difficult to include all these elements in a nazm. 
In that regard, she mentioned the poem Punjab 1947 in the book, which she claimed comes across as a short film. She read the poem, too, and it has to be said that among all those who had recited nazms and ghazals that evening, Ms Nigah’s reading was well-enunciated and poignant. 
Ms Nigah pointed out some people are of the opinion that Khalique’s poetry is influenced by the legendary N M Rashid’s. She argued that there’s a vast difference between getting influenced (muta’asir) by someone and copying (naql) someone’s style. A good poet knows, and should know, how to be influenced. A bad copies and a good poet gets influenced. However, there are conditions to become the latter. First of all, the versifier himself has to be a mature poet. The other important thing is that the poet must have something to say and have a wide canvas of subjects.

The SHC also ordered the SBCA to removal illegal constructions, file criminal prosecution against builders/owners of such buildings, take action against architects and licensed inspecting engineers concerned as well as against SBCA officials for allowing such constructions.
It summoned the deputy commissioner-East along with a comprehensive report about encroachments in a Gulshan-i-Iqbal area.
The court also called the record of an approval for construction granted by the SBCA in 2019 to a man who had died in 1989.
A two-judge SHC bench headed by Justice Zafar Ahmed Rajput issued these directives on a set of petitions filed against illegal and unauthorised constructions and encroachments in different parts of the city.
In the light of the last order, the SBCA chief appeared in court on Tuesday. The bench berated him over frequent transfers of officials and said it was affecting their morale and weaken administration as well as the implementation of court orders against illegal and unauthorised constructions.
The SBCA chief conceded that they were facing different issues including incompetence while the lawyer for SBCA stated that there was no time frame in the authority for transfer and posting of officials.
A deputy director of the SBCA filed a compliance report about illegal constructions in Nazimabad and stated that a four-storey building was constructed against the approval granted for the ground-plus-one-floor.
He further stated that the fourth floor of the building had been demolished while notices issued to utility agencies to disconnect their connections in order to remove the remaining unauthorised construction and criminal prosecution had also been filed against the builder.
The bench said that after perusal of the compliance report and documents it appeared that the permission for raising construction of ground-plus-one-floor was granted to Syed Mehboob Hashmi in October 2019 while the petitioner said that Mehboob Hashmi was his father and he passed away in 1989 and no person of the same name ever existed in his family.
The bench directed the deputy director to submit the complete case file of the subject approval as well as further progress regarding the action against alleged violation.

Talking to Dawn, chief minister’s adviser on agriculture Manzoor Hussain Wasan said that while an acute shortage of irrigation water in lower Sindh during Kharif as well as in Rabi 2021-22 was bound to affect yield of crops, the province was not given its due share of fertiliser by the Centre. 
“Had Sindh been given the due share of fertiliser by the federation, there would have been no shortage of it in the province,” he said, adding that 96,493 tonnes urea and 12,786 tonnes DAP were available in the province as on Dec 13.  
The adviser said Sindh was not getting its due share of urea. Sindh needed 4.6 million urea bags for wheat crop sown on 1.2 million hectares.

Talking to reporters after presiding over a meeting of party leaders at Garhi Khuda Bakhsh Bhutto on Tuesday, Khuhro reacted to federal minister Asad Umar’s statement and asked him stop issuing threats of unconstitutional steps. 
He said that neither the Muttahida Qaumi Movement nor Pak Sarzameen Party were not sole representatives of Urdu-speaking community as ethnic politics had now become a thing of the past. 
He said that those who had compromised Sindh’s rights and census issue had better stop threatening people now as people of Sindh had refused to succumb to pressures and threats. 
He alleged that MQM had compromised Sindh’s rights to obtain ministries and betray Sindh’s interests. The local government bill had become a law now and it no more required governor’s assent, he said. 
He accused the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government of pursuing a double-faced policy and said the PTI criticised the Sindh’s LG bill passed by Sindh Assembly while it had itself brought in an ordinance in Punjab on local government, which was against democratic norms. 
About the centre’s decision taken in CDWP’s recent meeting to stop funding provincial development projects related to devolved departments, he said the ‘move’ was a conspiracy to curtail provinces’ share in the National Finance Commission award and further strengthen the centre. 
He called the step unconstitutional and said when the centre held 43 per cent share in NFC it should have to allocate funds for provincial development projects, he said.
If the federal government did not want to fund provincial development projects then it should better increase provinces share from 57 per cent to 60 per cent and release Sindh its just share, he said. 
He said that if it was acceptable to the centre, Sindh would be ready to execute all its development projects. The federal government appeared to work towards strong centre without realising that strong provinces were symbol of a strong centre, he said. 
Earlier, Khuhro said while chairing the meeting held to review arrangements for a big public meeting at the 14th death anniversary of Benazir Bhutto on Dec 27 in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh Bhutto that PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zarari and former president Asif Ali Zardari would be key speakers on the day.
