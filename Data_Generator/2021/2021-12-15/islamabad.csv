4,CDA plans changes to bylaws of housing societies,"""We are also planning to get personal guarantee from the owner of a housing scheme for keeping a strong check,"" says CDA chairman.","ISLAMABAD: The city managers have decided to change the bylaws of housing societies, under which instead of cancelling the entire layout plan action will be taken only against the specific portion of a society where violations have been made.
“We are going to make changes to the bylaws to protect rights of citizens and keep a complete check on operators of housing schemes,” said CDA Chairman Amer Ali Ahmed.
Talking to Dawn, he said in the upcoming board meeting the new policy/bylaws will be discussed.
He said the concerned wing will be bound not to cancel the entire layout plan of any scheme rather action should be taken against only the defected area.
He said instead of getting bank guarantees the CDA was also planning to get personal guarantee from the owner of a housing scheme so that they could not disassociate themselves from the scheme after selling plots.
The CDA after issuing layout plans of housing schemes used to cancel the entire plan when violations were reported.
However, the CDA management has now decided that only the specific portion where violation is committed will be cancelled to protect the right of people whose plots, houses fall on other areas of society.
The layout plan is the blueprint of any housing society which is approved by CDA allowing the operators to develop it.
The approval of the layout plan does not allow the operators to sell plots. Plots can be sold after getting a non-objection certificate (NOC) which is issued when the society develops the scheme in accordance with the layout plan.
However, CDA officials said many societies after getting approved their layout plans sold out plots and when the CDA cancelled the layout plans the buyers of plots faced the consequences.
“When we cancelled the layout plan of an entire scheme, all those who made investment in the society faced problems. In many cases, without any violations, people just because of the cancelled LOP/NOC were not eligible to get utility connections or loans from banks,” said an official.
Currently, there are over 100 unauthorised housing schemes in Islamabad and most of them got approval of their layout plan which was cancelled later.
There are only around 20 legitimate housing schemes with valid LOP and NOCs.
On the other hand, thousands of residents of unauthorised housing schemes have been suffering as they are ineligible to get utility connections.
Officials shuffled
The CDA management shuffled officials in the planning wing. Director architecture Arshad Chohan has been appointed as the director housing societies in place of Faraz Malik, who has been appointed as the director regional planning.
Similarly, deputy director housing societies Touqeer Nawaz Awan has been appointed as the director master plan.

6,ICCI seeks help to tackle radioactive contamination in industrial units,Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority will organise seminars to sensitise the business community about radioactive contamination.,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ICCI) has sought the help of Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority (PNRA) to control any chance of radioactive contamination in industrial units.
The two sides will collaborate to ensure the production of commodities free of radioactive sources.
PNRA Member Executive Mohammad Rahman and Director General Licensing and Authorisation Mohammad Qayyum along with other officials visited the ICCI on Tuesday to discuss the matter.
Mr Rahman briefed the ICCI team about the main functions of PNRA and said metal and non-metal scrap was an important raw material for the metal industry which was usually imported from different countries.
However, due to the weak regulatory controls over the sources in the exporting countries, there are chances of intermingling of radioactive sources within the imported scrap metals.
He said if such sources remained undetected, their untended melting has the potential to cause unnecessary radiation exposure to the public which would have serious financial, social and economic costs.
“PNRA intends to develop close liaison with chambers of commerce, including the ICCI, for effective implementation of regulatory requirements in relevant industries to prevent any radioactive sources in production activities,” Mr Rahman added.
He said industries should install radiation detection systems, and assured the ICCI that the authority will provide them technical support in selection and procurement of such systems.
The ICCI members were informed that PNRA will organise free of cost training of the relevant manpower in industrial units to ensure production of radioactive free commodities.
He said industries should develop procedures and mechanism for notification to PNRA and management of radioactive sources if found through detection mechanisms.
It was noted that all industrial units needed to work with PNRA for compliance with regulatory requirements by industries to prevent radioactive sources/radioactive.
The participants of the meeting noted that contamination in scrap and metal products was also becoming an international concern.
ICCI President Mohammad Shakeel Munir appreciated the role of PNRA for regulating, controlling and supervising matters related to nuclear safety, nuclear security and radiation protection measures. He said ICCI would cooperate in identifying the industries which required radiation detection equipment.
It was decided that the ICCI would also collaborate in execution of PNRA survey strategy in different industries.
PNRA would organise awareness seminars in trade bodies on a regular basis to educate and sensitise the business community about the preventive measures of radioactive contamination and this campaign will start from ICCI.
The two sides discussed a range of issues to make industries and businesses free of radioactive contaminants.

11,Call for expanding nuclear energy share in power generation to 20pc,ISLAMABAD: Adviser to the National Command Authority on Nuclear Power Dr Ansar Parvez has cautioned against lowering...,"ISLAMABAD: Adviser to the National Command Authority on Nuclear Power Dr Ansar Parvez has cautioned against lowering priority for nuclear energy in the power generation mix and has called for expanding its share to at least 20 per cent of the electricity generation capacity.
Dr Parvez, who has previously headed Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC), was speaking to participants of a webinar organised by the Strategic Vision Institute (SVI) titled ‘Pakistan’s Energy Security and Role of Nuclear Technology’.
Underscoring the importance of nuclear energy, he said it should continue to play an important role in the generation mix as it was cheap, reliable and had a higher productive capacity factor.
Dr Parvez suggested increasing the share of nuclear energy in the generation mix from the current 8pc to at least 20pc.
His contention was that nuclear plants unlike most of the other generation sources are baseload plants that produce electricity at a constant rate to meet the continuous demand. “Once 20pc of your capacity is on secure baseload, you can build as many of solar, wind, and hydel plants,” he said.
Pakistan currently has an installed nuclear capacity of 2,490 MW, which would next year grow to 3,635 MW with the addition of a 1,145 MW K-3 plant. No further growth in this capacity is expected till 2030 as no other nuclear power plant is currently under construction.
He suggested that solar, wind and other renewables were being prioritised in the national planning as they are cheap.
Dr Parvez, emphasising the significance of energy planning said it has a direct bearing on economic security, environmental security and national security.
Another expert Dr Zafar Ali said Pakistan accords utmost importance to nuclear security and technology regulations as a national responsibility. Over the years, he said, Pakistan has established a comprehensive and effective national nuclear regulatory regime, which covers nuclear material and other radioactive materials and associated activities.
He said that the regulatory arrangements while preventing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction should not hamper international cooperation in the peaceful uses of technology. A non-discriminatory approach towards civilian nuclear cooperation, he added, will not only benefit the global non-proliferation regime but also help in achieving the United Nations sustainable goals.

This consensus emerged at an international conference on “Securitising non-traditional security dynamics in South Asia: contemporary challenges and future trajectories” organised by School of Politics and International Relations (SPIR), Quaid-i-Azam University (QAU), in collaboration with Hanns Seidel Foundation (HSF).
Speakers argued that South Asia grapples with multiple non-traditional security challenges including deteriorating air quality in major cities, the Covid-19 pandemic, poverty and under-development, gender discrimination, refugees, illegal trade, smuggling and drug trafficking.
Contrary to the situation, the security dynamics in international relations are skewed towards traditional issue areas focused on military, strategic and power political aspirations of sovereignty-laden states engaged in zero-sum competition against each other.
The purpose of the two-day conference is to chart out ways in which non-traditional security challenges can be securitised.
SPIR DirectorDr Farhan Hanif Siddiqi said the purpose of the conference was to bring voices from Afghanistan, India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Pakistan and rest of the region on the subject.
Resident representative Hanns Seidel Foundation Dr Steffen Kudella said academic research was objective, transparent, logically consistent, verifiable, honest and most importantly relevant.
The HSF tries to strengthen this kind of research on non-traditional security issues in Pakistan and the region.
SPIR Professor Dr Zafar Nawaz Jaspal said without cooperation it will be difficult to deal with non-traditional security because the repercussion of the challenges was not limited within the border and had a spillover effect.
QAU Registrar Dr Raja Qaisar Ahmed stressed promotion of open spaces for such critical debates. He said it was high time to go beyond established narratives of security and build new knowledge for better trajectories.
Professor of Public Policy at National University of Science and Technology (Nust) Dr Syed Rifaat Hussain explained the history and evolution of the concept of non-traditional security.
He also focused on how state was created as a moral and ethical community, not only as a political community, and that was why it needed to address non-traditional security issues.
Dr Mohammad Mujeeb Afzal, assistant professor at the SPIR, argued that securitisation theory had helped us understand the power play of politicians and decision makers in the formulation of national security policy.
Professor and Dean National Institute of Advanced Studies, Bangalore, India, Dr Suba Chandran elaborated on conceptualising and contextualising non-traditional security. He also presented his five theses on the subject.
Professor of Peace and Conflict Studies at the National Defence University, Islamabad, Dr Arshi Saleem Hashmi discussed the regional and transnational non-traditional security challenges and how states after identifying them may be able to come up with coordinated efforts to deal with them.
Deputy Executive Director, Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI), Dr Vaqar Ahmed argued that possibilities of intra-regional market diversification existed if liberal exchange of trade delegations was pursued and also Covid-19 had given rise to new possibilities which could bring economies on compassionate grounds.
Assistant Resident Representative United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Ammara Durrani highlighted the post-pandemic trends and mitigation strategies that can be adopted at regional and national levels.
Deputy Director and Associate Professor Symbiosis School of International Studies, Pune, India, Dr Sukalpa Chakrabarti discussed Covid-19 and human security in India. She said the pandemic needs to be scrutinised from non-traditional security perspective.

The said sub zone comprises 23,618 acres of land and as per existing bylaws, it is reserved for agro farming, nature conservation projects, sports and recreation, playgrounds, entertainment zones and so on.
Apartments, office buildings and hotels are also allowed in this zone.
A press release issued by Capital Development Authority (CDA) stated: “It was decided at the meeting that the Master Plan Review Commission would work on building by-laws for Zone 4-D of Islamabad with the objective of promoting high rise vertical development in Islamabad and ensuring protection of green areas ... Allowing housing units and high rise developments in sub zone D will be a good decision as people, who have their own land, in this zone due to CDA’s rigid policies are unable to do planned construction”.
According to a CDA official, besides focusing on this sub-zone, the commission and CDA should also take steps to protect rights of people, who have their own land, in Zone III, but they are unable to plan construction.
He added that CDA is not acquiring private land in Zone III or allowing people to plan construction which is discrimination.
A meeting of the commission was chaired by its convener, CDA Chairman Amer Ali Ahmed.
It was also decided that the commission will give its proposals to reduce the current housing foot print in Zone IV from 55 feet to 20 to 25 per cent.
Similarly, the press release said, in light of the federal cabinet’s decision in August 2021, the commission will give suggestions for implementation and enforcement of building by laws for regulating illegal housing societies and constructions in suburbs of city.
