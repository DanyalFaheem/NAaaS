0,Intensive electioneering makes quite a contest,Electioneering for PP-206 by-polls (Khanewal) ended up on a sour note on Tuesday as PPP candidate Mir Syed Wasiq...,"Electioneering for PP-206 by-polls (Khanewal) ended up on a sour note on Tuesday as PPP candidate Mir Syed Wasiq Sirjees Haider alleged that his house was attacked by PML-N supporters.
Polling will be held on Thursday (tomorrow).
He said the mob pelted the house with stones and attempted to climb the boundary walls. PPP MPA Ali Haider Gilani alleged PML-N’s Ata Tarrar instigated the attackers.
In an application to the Khanewal city police, the PPP candidate alleged that the PML-N candidate Rana Saleem, Mr Tarrar with three former PML-N MPAs and 100 unidentified people attacked the house. The PML-N, however, rejected the allegation.
Earlier, electioneering for the PPP, PML-N, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) and Tehreek-i-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) candidates by their top leadership made the by-poll a contest worth watching.
The PML-N candidate had the support of central leadership like Talal Chaudhry, Rana Sanaullah, Ata Tarar and the party leaders of the Multan division.
According to exit polls, the PML-N candidate is leading the constituency with the support of 36 municipal councillors, out of 46. The candidate also has the support of the JUI-F and the JUP. The party has won the elections from the area first on the platform of the IJI and then as PML-N in 1988, 1990, 1993, 1997, 2013 and 2018.
The PTI has fielded Noreen Nishat Daha, the widow of Nishat Daha, whose election campaign was being run by local PTI MNAs, MPAs and ministers. The candidate won the support of several former candidates for the constituency and elders of rural areas. The party is banking on the development work carried out by the deceased MPA.
The TLP has Sheikh Akmal as a candidate for the by-poll. The party workers were mobilised when the party chief, Saad Rizvi, visited the constituency on Dec 13 and addressed a massive rally. Locals say the party will act as a spoiler for the PML-N candidate. The candidate has spent a good amount on publicity material.
The PPP’s campaign was spearheaded by the Gillani House in Multan. Former prime minister Yousaf Raza Gilani’s three sons, MNAs Irshad Siyal and Nawabzada Iftikhar Khan, and the sons of PPP South Punjab President Makhddom Ahmed Mehmood with local party leadership remained engaged in union councils assigned to them by the party.
The party remained unsuccessful in the constituency, except for 2008 when Nishat Daha was a PPP candidate. Otherwise, the party’s candidates remained runner up in 1988, 1990, 1993, and 1997 elections.
The Election Commission of Pakistan has made arrangements to conduct this election transparent, peaceful and lawful manner.
The presiding officer will receive the polling bag from the returning officer. Along with the police, Rangers personnel will provide security to presiding officers.
Security arrangements have been made at all 183 polling stations in the constituency. Presiding officers have been instructed to keep their location on mobile phones while taking Form 45 photo on the polling day.
They will also take Form 45 photo in front of the polling agents and immediately inform the returning officer on WhatsApp. In case of lack of internet access, the presiding officer will immediately reach returning officer’s office and hand over the original copy of Form 45 to them.

5,Traffic rule violation: LHC turns down mayor’s request for cut in fine,Terms imposition of heavy fines on the rickshaw drivers and the motorcyclists a harsh decision.,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Tuesday turned down a request of Lord Mayor retired Col Mubashir Javed for reducing the amount of fine being imposed on motorcyclists and auto-rickshaw drivers for violation of one-way traffic rule on the city roads.
During the hearing of smog and pollution related petitions, the mayor requested the court to review its order regarding imposition of Rs2,000 fine for traffic violations, especially on motorcyclists and rickshaw drivers.
He said a rickshaw driver hardly earned Rs700 or so in a day, terming imposition of heavy fines on the rickshaw drivers and the motorcyclists a harsh decision.
The mayor pointed out that a woman riding a motorcycle with her son on the Canal Road burst into tears when a traffic warden issued them a fine ticket of Rs2,000.
“The woman did not even have Rs200,” said Mr Javed, asking the court to review the earlier direction purely on compassionate grounds.
Justice Shahid Karim, however, rejected the assertion of the mayor that the fine was excessive and exorbitant. The judge observed that a collective effort was needed to control the environment woes.
The judge also directed the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) to spread awareness about smog amongst the masses.
However, the judge warned the provincial government against using its name in the public awareness campaign.
The judge adjourned the hearing till Dec 16 and directed the government to take punitive measures against industrial emissions and the people involved in burning of crop waste and garbage.
The judge had on Nov 19 ordered the city traffic police to impose a minimum fine of Rs2,000, especially on the violation of one-way rule on roads by the motorists.
Car owner fined: The city traffic police on Tuesday imposed a fine to the tune of Rs80,400 on a car owner, who had allegedly committed 166 traffic violations in the city.
The car owner had jumped traffic signals 142 times, a serious violation involving risks for the driver himself, as well as others using road.
A spokesperson for the city traffic police said the car owner was a resident of Islamabad and used to travel to Lahore to see his relatives.
On Tuesday, he said, a warden stopped the car owner, traveling along with his family, at a signal in Nawankot area to randomly check his vehicle’s status and found 166 rule violations.
On being questioned, the driver said he had come from Islamabad to inquire after a patient admitted to a Lahore hospital and requested not to impound the car.
The warden imposed Rs80,400 fine and seized the original registration book of his car.
The warden, he said, let the driver go on an assurance that he won’t commit any traffic violation in future.
The spokesperson said 17 special teams of wardens have been fielded with ‘special handsets’ carrying record of the vehicles plying on the city roads.

He also deplored that fish exports had declined.
The people were out on the streets in Gwadar against this government and the State Bank was no longer under Pakistan’s government but under IMF’s command. “The country is buried under Rs20,000bn extra loan in three years which is almost as much as the loan taken in the entire history of the country,” he said and asked was this change Imran Niazi promised to the nation.
Meanwhile, opposition leader in the Punjab Assembly Hamza Shehbaz said Imran Niazi had destroyed the old Pakistan in a bid to make a new one. Hamza urged all opposition and religious parties to join hands against this government in and outside parliament to send it home.

Addressing party workers at Mansoorah on Tuesday, he said the objective of all political parties was to maintain their grip over power and keep the common man away from the decision-making process. The three parties were the clubs of feudal lords and capitalists and protector of status quo, he said and added Pakistan needed a powerful local government system.
“The LG polls should be held in a transparent manner, without interference of the government and the establishment. They should also be held on time and as per schedule like the general elections.”
Mr Haq said the presence of powerful LG system was the main source of development as was there in the western countries. The west, he added, strengthened its democracy through the devolution of power. He said the JI would make full participation in the LG elections, directing the party leaders and workers to make preparations for it.
“Go to the people in every nook and corner and inform them about the manifesto of the JI,” he advised the participants in the meeting, saying the objective of the party was to transform the country into an Islamic welfare state.
He said the PTI had failed to bring about any change, keeping the former government policies continued.

The proposed alliance, to be formed at the conclusion of the two-day Inequality Conference currently under way in Lahore, will hold demonstrations and undertake other steps for building pressure on the government to change its policies responsible for widening the inequality gap, reveals the charter distributed at the moot.
The alliance will call for rejecting market fundamentalism and building economic alternatives that put people and planet first, building just economies that do not discriminate against and exploit women, stopping climate catastrophe by protecting affected communities and ending the undue influence of the fossil fuel industry.
It also seeks to make worker’s rights the cornerstone of economic model and end corporate greed, making wealthy corporations and individuals pay their fair share of tax, rejecting privatisation of essential services, building strong responsible states and ensure social protection for all as well as putting land back into the hands of women and smallholder farmers and ending the dominance of agribusiness.
Prof Ammar Ali Jan said inequality is in fact a suicide attack on society. Blaming the government policies for adding to the economic inequality, he called for uniting all popular movements on a single platform to get the policies changed.
Prof Fahad Ali said economic inequality had no relation with religion. He said the poor areas of Balochistan were 40pc poorer than the poor regions of Punjab. He regretted the subsidy given by the government during Covid-19 was usurped by the capitalists, while the workers were either sacked or their wages were slashed.

Dr Zahid Bilal, in-charge DM&CD, said there was a dire need to revisit the existing concept of human rights in Pakistan. “We can reduce social inequality and curtail human rights violations only through the provision of equal education opportunities for all.” Director Student Affairs Dr Shoaib Saleem highlighted the importance of youth empowerment and awareness for addressing the issues pertaining to human rights violations in society.
Dr Abdul Ghaffar from Department of Islamic Studies and Dr Sumaira Ijaz from DoU also spoke.
