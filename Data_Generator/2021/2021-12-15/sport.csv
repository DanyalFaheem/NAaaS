0,United clash off as Covid causes Premier League disruption,The Premier League Board took the decision to postpone the Brentford clash “based on guidance from medical advisers”.,"LONDON: Manchester United’s match at Brentford on Tuesday was postponed as the English Premier League reported a record number of Covid-19 cases, with the virus threatening to disrupt the busy Christmas fixture list.
It came hours after the Old Trafford club closed their Carrington training complex because of several players and staff members testing positive for coronavirus.
The Premier League Board took the decision to postpone the Brentford clash  “based on guidance from medical advisors”, said a Manchester United statement.
United’s fixture in west London was the second Premier League game to fall to the virus in three days, after Tottenham Hotspur’s match at Brighton & Hove Albion on Sunday was called off.
“Manchester United can confirm that our Premier League fixture at Brentford FC, on Tuesday 14 December at 19:30, has been postponed and will be rescheduled in due course,” a United statement late on Monday said.
With the Omicron variant sweeping across Britain, there are growing virus issues at several Premier League clubs.
The Premier League on Monday reported 42 new Covid-19 cases in the past week — a seven-day record since testing figures started being released in May 2020 -- up from 12 cases the previous week.
More fixtures could come under threat with Brighton, Tottenham, Leicester City, Aston Villa and Norwich City all reporting confirmed Covid-19 cases in recent days.
Norwich are due to host Villa on Tuesday, while Tottenham are scheduled to travel to Leicester on Thursday.
All of United’s players tested negative before Saturday’s match at Norwich, but it was reported a group of players and staff tested positive on Sunday.
“Following PCR confirmation of positive tests among the first-team staff and players, the outbreak requires ongoing surveillance with individuals who tested positive isolating in line with Premier League protocols,” added the United statement.
The Premier League last week instructed all clubs to reinstate Covid-19 restrictions, including a return to social distancing and mask wearing.
“With the health of players and staff the priority, and in light of the recent rise in Covid-19 cases across the country, the Premier League has reintroduced emergency measures,” the Premier League reiterated in a statement late Monday.
“These include protocols such as more frequent testing, wearing face coverings while indoors, observing social distancing and limiting treatment time.”
Brentford expressed disappointment for their supporters at the postponement, but said the  “health and safety of both clubs’ players and staff must always come first”.
Aston Villa manager Steven Gerrard said that his team had a virus outbreak involving  “a couple of staff members and a couple of players” which led to the club cancelling training on Sunday.
However, the squad trained as normal on Monday ahead of their trip to Carrow Road, where United won 1-0 on Saturday.
“We retested this morning and we have got a couple of staff and a couple of players missing for the foreseeable future,” said Gerrard.
“But the vast majority have come through the test this morning and we look forward to competing against Norwich.”
Brighton manager Graham Potter said there were  “three or four” positive tests among his squad, but their match against Wolves on Wednesday was not currently under threat.
Tottenham boss Antonio Conte admitted he had been  “scared” by the outbreak at the north London club, which also caused their European fixture against Rennes last week to be called off after eight players and five members of Spurs’ staff tested positive.
Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta last week called for the Premier League to issue clearer guidelines on how many positive tests should trigger a postponement.
Arteta’s side lost at Brentford on the opening weekend of this season when their game went ahead despite four positive tests.

Looking to get back to winning ways after losing their previous two league matches, centre-back Chris Smalling headed Roma into a sixth-minute lead at the Stadio Olimpico.
English striker Tammy Abraham then hit the crossbar with an unorthodox chest towards goal as Roma pressed for a second, with the same player again going close early in the second half.
The second goal came in the 56th minute, also from a corner, as Roger Ibanez headed home to put the game to bed. The victory was tarnished somewhat when 18-year-old Roma substitute Felix Afena-Gyan was sent off late on after picking up two bookings as the hosts moved to 28 points from 17 games above Juve on goal difference. Spezia stay 17th on 12 points.
Mourinho was furious with the referee after seeing Afena-Gyan bizarrely dismissed, with the second of the Ghanaian teenager’s bookings brandished for handball as he ran through to score what he thought was Roma’s third in the 93rd minute.
The Portuguese coach was also not too happy with his team’s overall performance throughout the match.
“I liked the two goals from a corner because yesterday we trained on this for 20, 25 minutes,” Mourinho told Sky Sport Italia.
“I like the result but not the game or how we played. We were in control in the first half but we lost a lot of easy balls. “We brought Spezia back into the game, when it was not difficult to close it.”

2,No regrets in awarding Winter Games to China: IOC’s Dick Pound,Reiterates IOC’s stance that it has no role to play in bringing about political change in any country.,"LAUSANNE: International Olympic Committee (IOC) senior member Dick Pound said he had no regrets about China being selected to host the 2022 Winter Games despite the international backlash over the country’s human rights record.
The US, Canada, Britain and Australia are among the countries that recently announced a diplomatic boycott of the Feb 4-20 Beijing Games, which China called  “political posturing.”
“In the sense of having a host country that could organise and put on an excellent Games from a Games perspective, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with China,” Pound told Germany’s Deutschlandfunk radio. “It’s a very good and very organised country.”
Pound reiterated the IOC’s stance that it has no role to play in bringing about political change in any country.
“You have to be reasonable about the expectations of a relatively small organisation,” he said of the IOC.
“When we award the Games to a country, we don’t do it as an indication that we support the political objectives of that country.
“It’s done on the basis of the importance of the country as a sporting nation and its ability to organise Games at the level that the world now expects.”
He said China’s Olympic Organising Committee has agreed to allow athletes to speak freely during news conferences on issues such as the treatment of minority Muslims in China’s Xinjiang region, which US President Joe Biden’s administration has called genocide. China denies all human rights abuses.
“The organising committee has given that guarantee that there will be freedom of speech for athletes,” added Pound.
Athletes will still have to abide by an IOC rule that says they cannot protest during sporting events or medal ceremonies.

4,Aubameyang stripped of Arsenal captaincy for discipline breach,"He was left out for Saturday’s 3-0 win over Southampton, will also not feature for West Ham’s visit to the Emirates on Wednesday.","LONDON: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been stripped of the Arsenal captaincy following a breach of discipline as manager Mikel Arteta outlined on Tuesday his desire for a culture change at the club.
The 32-year-old forward was left out for Saturday’s 3-0 win over Southampton and will also not feature for West Ham’s visit to the Emirates on Wednesday.
“Following his latest disciplinary breach last week, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang will no longer be our club captain, and will not be considered for selection for Wednesday’s match against West Ham United,” Arsenal said in a statement.
“We expect all our players, particularly our captain, to work to the rules and standards we have all set and agreed.”
According to The Athletic website, Aubameyang returned later than agreed from a personal trip to France last week, which subsequently forced him to miss training due to the need to pass coronavirus protocols.
Aubameyang was also left out by Arteta for a victory over north London rivals Tottenham in March over a disciplinary issue when he arrived late for a pre-match meeting.
“It is a really a clear statement from the club. It is the decision we have made with the last incident we had with the player and this is where we stand,” Arteta said at a pre-match press conference.
“We had to make the decision, it is the right one to defend the interest of the football club.”
Aubameyang was named Arsenal skipper in 2019 after Granit Xhaka was also stripped of the role for his tirade towards supporters after being substituted in a Premier League match against Crystal Palace.
The Gabon attacker initially revelled in the role, leading Arsenal to their only trophy under Arteta by scoring twice in the semi-final and final of the FA Cup in 2020.
However, Aubameyang’s form has dipped since signing a three-year deal that made him one of the highest earners in the Premier League worth a reported 18 million ($24 million) a year.
He scored just 10 Premier League goals as Arsenal finished eighth last season and has four in 14 league appearances this campaign.
“It is a really unpleasant situation,” Arteta said.
“The players accepted the decision, they know because they have committed to it.
“We want to take our culture and how we want to represent the football club to a different level.”
Arteta said he has not taken a quick decision on who will take the armband from Aubameyang.
Xhaka, Alexandre Lacazette, Kieran Tierney, Ben White and Aaron Ramsdale have all been tipped as potential captains.
Arsenal failed to qualify for European football for the first time in 25 years last season.
The Gunners are aiming to end a five-year absence from the Champions League this season and can move into the Premier League’s top four with victory over West Ham.

7,"‘Monster’ Inoue defends WBA, IBF titles against Aran Dipaen",Inoue wore Dipaen down with a series of punishing shots before dispatching him with a vicious left hand.,"TOKYO: Japan’s unbeaten  “Monster” Naoya Inoue defended his WBA and IBF bantamweight titles on Tuesday with an eighth-round technical knockout win over unheralded Thai challenger Aran Dipaen in Tokyo.
Fighting at Ryogoku Kokugikan -- the home of sumo -- Inoue wore Dipaen down with a series of punishing shots before dispatching him with a vicious left hand.
The bout, Inoue’s first in Japan for around two years, was widely seen as a stepping-stone towards an attempt at unifying all four bantamweight belts next year.
But the 28-year-old was made to work hard for his win over Dipaen, who absorbed a series of heavy body blows with little visible impact.
“He used to be a Muay Thai fighter and he brought that toughness,” Inoue said of Dipaen, who went into the fight with a 12-2 record.
“I started to wonder whether my punches were having an effect -- that’s how tough he was.”
Inoue took his unbeaten record to 22-0, with 19 wins by knockout.
After hammering away on Dipaen’s body, Inoue finally put the challenger away with a big left that sent him down to the canvas.
“The fight didn’t go as everyone was expecting, but it was good to fight in Japan again after two years,” Inoue said.
Inoue has set his sights on unifying the bantamweight belts next year, with WBA champion Nonito Donaire and WBO title-holder John Riel Casimero standing in his way.
But he warned that he could turn his attentions elsewhere if no agreement could be reached with either fighter next year.
“I’ve been placing a lot of importance on unifying the four belts, but if the individual fights don’t happen, I’ll start thinking about the super-bantamweight title,” Inoue said.
Inoue beat Donaire in the final of the World Boxing Super Series in 2019, claiming a unanimous points win over the veteran Filipino after an epic contest.
But Donaire went on to win the WBC belt earlier this year, and defended it in style at the age of 39 against countryman Reymart Gaballo on Saturday.
Casimero, meanwhile, pulled out of his WBO title fight against Britain’s Paul Butler in Dubai on Saturday after missing the weigh-in.
Reports said the Filipino was admitted to hospital with viral gastritis, and the WBO has ordered him to present his medical documents before Dec 20 or face being stripped of his title.

8,Pakistan survive King’s onslaught to clinch T20 series,KARACHI: There was a moment at the National Stadium on Tuesday when the West Indies probably felt they could pull ...,"KARACHI: There was a moment at the National Stadium on Tuesday when the West Indies probably felt they could pull off an improbable win.
Even with just his forehand, Brandon King found the perfect connection.
Shadab Khan could only look up into the night sky to see where the ball went; and then just stared at King. 
One-handed, King had smashed him over his head and over the boundary, taking this second-string West Indies — missing several of their big-name players and in a state of rebuilding following their dismal T20 World Cup campaign — to 102-3, 71 runs away from victory with six overs to go.
A sparse crowd at the venue could’ve been forgiven for thinking they might see their team on the losing side.
But Pakistan captain Babar Azam brought on Mohammad Wasim Jr and he engineered West Indies’ downfall.
Rovman Powell was dismissed and King soon followed, his dismissal for a match-high 67 all but ending West Indies’ hopes of taking the three-match Twenty20 International series into a decider on Thursday.
Shaheen Shah Afridi’s three wickets in a single over then seemed to have put the game beyond West Indies’ reach but Romario Shepherd’s late fireworks brought them close.
They only lost by nine runs after being dismissed for 163 on the final ball of their innings, a massive improvement on their showing in the opening match on Monday where they were thumped by 63 runs.
Pakistan, though, have another series victory, following their 3-0 whitewash of Bangladesh last month. Their Twenty20 juggernaut keeps rolling on. This was their 10th win in 11 matches — the only defeat coming in the semi-finals to eventual champions Australia at the Twenty20 World Cup.
This time, they won thanks to some late order hitting from Iftikhar Ahmed (32 off 19) and man-of-the-match Shadab Khan (28 off 12) who took Pakistan to 172-8 in their 20 overs.
“Shadab’s innings was outstanding,” Babar said after the match. “His innings was crucial in providing us with a total to defend.”
For a second successive game, it fell to Mohammad Rizwan and Haider Ali to resurrect Pakistan innings after another early wobble.
For a second straight night, they repaired some damage but it wasn’t similar to the one that had left the West Indies on the ropes in the opening game of the series where the duo ended with half-centuries in a 105-run stand.
Captain Babar Azam’s run out, trying to steal a single, and Fakhar Zaman’s stumping had left the hosts at 38-2 when Haider joined Rizwan at the crease.
With West Indies spinners not letting Pakistan score freely, they combined for 48 before Rizwan, seemingly poised for another big score in this prolific, record-breaking year of his, chased a wide Odean Smith delivery to the fielder at short cover. He hit a six and four boundaries in a 30-ball 38.
With the final match of the series to come on Thursday, Rizwan has 1239 runs from 28 matches.
Haider, who made a sluggish start and departed soon after as he tried to accelerate and push Pakistan to a big total.
When he was caught by an on-rushing Shamarh Brooks on the point boundary for 31 off 34 deliveries, Pakistan were 109-4 with six overs to go.
Mohammad Nawaz, promoted up the order following his 30-run cameo in the first match, fell in the next over, caught at mid-wicket off Hayden Walsh.
Asif Ali was expected to provide the final flourish and pulled Odean Smith for a six over mid-wicket but was gone for nine in the following over by Shepherd with Rovman Powell running in to claim a diving catch.
It was in the last three overs that Pakistan pushed on the pedal — thanks largely to Iftikhar and Shadab.
Iftikhar, who had come to the crease following Rizwan’s departure, had just one boundary in his first 15 deliveries.
But he came to the fore in the 18th over, pulling away Oshane Thomas for a six on the third delivery and followed it with another on the fifth, this time clearing long-off.
Iftikhar, though, didn’t stay long and was caught behind on the final ball of the over but nevertheless setting up the stage for Shadab to lift Pakistan to a big total.
An inside edge went past fine leg for a four in the penultimate over before he hit Dominic Drakes for a six straight down the ground and over long-off and Mohammad Wasim Jr joined the party, improvising for a scooped boundary.
Two of the first three balls of the final over went over the fence with Shadab hitting the first over long-off and the other over long-on.
“At the position I bat on, in the death overs, I usually get to play only four to five balls so in practice I try to keep that in mind,” Shadab said afterwards. “Today, that hitting practice paid off.”
Wasim was run out on the next-to-last ball of the innings but Pakistan had got 45 in the last three overs and there was a feeling that they had done enough. Only just in the end.
King had got off the mark with an inside edge off a Shaheen yorker that flew past wicket-keeper Rizwan to the boundary.

But he grew into confidence with a six off Nawaz that sailed over long-off in the following over. 
Fellow opener Shai Hope, however, couldn’t stay long and mistimed a Wasim delivery to Iftikhar at midwicket.
New batsman Brooks got a lucky inside edge that went for four and then smashed Wasim over the midwicket boundary before being trapped lbw by Nawaz.
King and his skipper Nicholas Pooran then combined for a 54-run partnership, the duo keeping the scoreboard ticking with ones and twos and the occasional boundary.
Pooran departed for a run-a-ball 26 on the last ball of the 11th over; trying to hit Nawaz across the line and being caught splendidly by Haris Rauf, who came running in from long-off.
King reached his 50 in the 13th over and then hit Shadab for that towering six but Wasim shifted the momentum back towards Pakistan, dismissing Powell with a slower one.
King, though, was undaunted. His thumping drive off Wasim in the same over had too much power and even though Babar got a hand to it, he couldn’t prevent him from reaching the fence.
He then pulled Haris Rauf for the third six of his innings, only to perish on the next ball, caught by Nawaz at long-on. He also hit six boundaries in his 43-ball innings.
Odean Smith hit Haris for a six but became the first victim in Shaheen’s three-wicket 17th over when he was caught spectacularly by Asif in the deep. Shaheen then had Dominic Drakes caught behind on the last ball of the over and then cleaned up Walsh.
Shepherd hit two sixes and two fours in his 35 not out, including a six and a four in Haris’ final over, but they still fell short with Haris giving Pakistan the perfect victory moment when he castled tailender Oshane Thomas on the final ball of the West Indies innings.
“It’s a tough one for us,” Pooran said after the match. “Of course it was a big improvement from yesterday. We bowled well and planned to bat for the full 20 overs. We felt we had this one here.”

9,Afghanistan to host Pakistan for three ODIs,"The series will take place in February-March, however, the exact schedule will be released later.","KABUL: Afghanistan will host Pakistan for a three-match One-day International series in 2023, according to the Future Tours Programme (FTP) announced by the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) on Tuesday.
The series will take place in February-March, however the exact schedule will be released later.
“A total number of 11 ODIs, four T20Is and two Test series have been included in Afghanistan schedule for the upcoming two years. These series are scheduled on home and away basis, among which Afghanistan will play 18 home and 34 away matches, apart from participating in the Asia Cup 2022, ICC T20 World Cup 2022, Asia Cup 2023 and the ICC World Cup 2023,” a press release issued by the ACB said.
The ACB also stated that the team’s focus will be on playing limited-overs match due to the fact that major ICC events are scheduled for the next two years.
“If we bifurcate the tally into limited-overs cricket and the Test format, it clearly shows that Afghanistan’s focus will be on the shorter formats of the game. Consi­dering the fact that Afghan­istan will be playing seven ODI series in the ICC World Cup Super League, as well as participate in four major limited-overs events, such as the 2022 T20 Asia Cup (T20), 2022 T20 World Cup, 2023 ODI Asia Cup, and the 2023 World Cup,” the press release added.

“Though the game of cricket in Pakistan is working on sound footing, the condition of other sports is miserable, and this is disheartening for every athlete who wants to join sports professionally,” Zaheer said while speaking as the chief guest during a book launching ceremony held at a local club in Lahore.
“A star sportsperson having no financial worries cannot only serve better for the national cause, he would also be able to bring up his children with better education and make them good citizens,” Zaheer added.
When the audience was reminded that the government was also abolishing sports departments, Zaheer said with players having jobs sports departments will also function.
Meanwhile, POA president retired Lt Gen Syed Arif Hasan, secretary Khalid Mahmood, former hockey greats Tariq Aziz and Akhtar Rasool also spoke on the occasion.

ADELAIDE: England captain Joe Root on Tuesday backed Jack Leach and Rory Burns to bounce back from dismal Ashes performances, as star all-rounder Ben Stokes declared himself fit to carry the fight to Australia.
Root refused to rule out selecting spinner Leach in Thursday’s pink-ball Test in Adelaide, even though he conceded 102-1 from 13 overs as England stumbled to a nine-wicket loss in Brisbane.
England controversially rested veteran quicks Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad for the first Test but Root said the pair were  “fit and ready to go” in Adelaide.
Leach’s meagre returns in Brisbane would normally see him dropped to make room in the attack, but England will want a specialised slow bowler for Adelaide’s traditionally spin-friendly wicket.
“We’ve obviously got some big decisions to make,” Root told reporters in Adelaide.
He said conditions did not suit Leach at the Gabba but Australia could pay the price if they continued to target him elsewhere.
“I’m sure he’ll want to respond and he’ll want to get back into the series and have an impact,” the England skipper said.
“Some of the grounds that we will be going to from this point onwards should offer a lot more for him and bring spin into it as well.”
Root also offered support to opening batsman Burns, who fell to the first ball of the series in Brisbane and then dropped a crucial chance from David Warner.
“Rory is a very strong character, you can’t doubt that side of his game,” said Root, himself strongly criticised back in England after winning the toss in Brisbane and opting to bat first.
“He’ll come back in and want a response and want to put some big scores on the board.” 
STOKES SAYS CAN MANAGE KNEE ISSUE
Meanwhile, England’ all-rounder Ben Stokes said the knee issue that hampered him in the  Ashes opener was a flare-up of an older injury and the all-rounder is  confident he can manage it going into the Adelaide Test.
Stokes scored five and 14 in the nine-wicket defeat by  Australia in Brisbane and bowled only 12 wicketless overs after jarring  his knee.
It was his first competitive match since July after a  mental health break and rehabilitation following surgery on a broken  finger.
“Having a long break is going to show itself, but there  are no excuses,” Stokes wrote in his column for Britain’s Daily Mirror.
“I didn’t do anything whatsoever except take a  catch and bowl a few no balls so the one positive is I probably can’t  get much worse.
“People will have seen me rubbing my knee from  time to time when I was in the field, but rest assured I’m fine. It’s an  old injury that flares up every now and again, but I know how to manage  it.“It just gets a little bit uncomfortable ... in and around my  cartilage, but it just looks worse than it is by the way I try and get  off it as soon as I can,” he wrote.
