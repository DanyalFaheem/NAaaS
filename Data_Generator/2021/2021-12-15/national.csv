0,NAB asked to approach FBR in Rs8.3bn case,IHC hears arguments from both sides on pre-arrest bail plea of ex-president Zardari,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday directed the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to reconcile with the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) the matter of Rs8.3 billion suspicious transactions in which the anti-graft watchdog had nominated former president Asif Ali Zardari as one of accused persons. 
An IHC division bench comprising Chief Justice Athar Minallah and Justice Aamer Farooq, while hearing a pre-arrest bail plea of the ex-president, noted that the allegations levelled by NAB pertained to the FBR and, therefore, the bureau should have forwarded this matter to the FBR before filing the case. 
NAB’s additional prosecutor general Jahanzeb Khan Bharwana argued that the bureau had prepared the reference on the Supreme Court’s directive in the fake bank accounts case.
The defence counsel, Farooq H. Naek, argued before the court that NAB had dragged the ex-president in the case without any relevant provision of the National Accountability Ordinance. He said the allegation against his client was that he had purchased a property while holding a public office. 

IHC hears arguments from both sides on pre-arrest bail plea of ex-president Zardari

The NAB prosecutor, however, argued that the ex-president had committed offences that fell well within the ambit of the accountability ordinance. He explained that Mr Zardari had in his wealth statement shown Rs53 million as the value of his property, whereas Rs150m had been paid for its purchase. 
While the court reminded the prosecutor that this matter pertained to the FBR, the latter insisted that NAB could proceed against Mr Zardari even if the FBR’s matter was kept aside. 
Advocate Naek claimed that since the case was based on transactions of two private parties, Mr Zardari had nothing to do with them. He contended that the former president had purchased some properties in a legitimate manner and it was also a private business deal. 
According to the NAB reference, Mr Zardari could not provide proof of his claim that he had purchased his palatial house in Clifton through legal means, whereas accused Mushtaq Ahmed, who worked as a stenographer in the President House from 2009 to 2013, had allegedly provided Rs150m for construction of the house. 
According to the reference, an illegal transaction of Rs8.3bn was carried out via Mushtaq Ahmed’s bank account with the money paid to Bahria Town. 
A third accused in the case, Zain Malik, son-in-law of Bahria Town’s owner Malik Riaz, had earlier signed a plea bargain deal with NAB and deposited around Rs9bn in the national exchequer. 
The same bench also took up seven identical petitions of former bureaucrats and top officials of autonomous bodies seeking acquittal in NAB references.

1,"Effort under way to boost shipping fleet, says minister",LONDON: Pakistan is working to boost the capacity of its shipping fleet to draw on its strategic geographical...,"LONDON: Pakistan is working to boost the capacity of its shipping fleet to draw on its strategic geographical position and help tackle the effects of a global supply chain crisis, federal Minister for Maritime Affa­irs Ali Haider Zaidi told Reuters. 
Pakistan has a coastline of over 1,000 kilometres and three major ports, including Karachi. It is two days sailing time from destinations in Africa and the Middle East and its western shoreline is close to the Strait of Hormuz oil chokepoint. 
A surge in demand for retail goods from people stuck at home under pandemic-related lockdowns and logjams impacting the supply of container ships and boxes to transport cargo have led to bottlenecks around the globe, which are set to continue into 2022. 
Mr Zaidi said the country is in negotiations “through a public-private mechanism to create joint ventures to expand into container shipping”. 
“The supply chain problems are faced by everyone and Pakistan is also affected. There are issues everywhere and this is one of the ways we are trying to deal with this longer term,” he said on a visit to London. 
The state-controlled Pakistan National Shipping Corporation has a fleet of 11 ships, including oil tankers and dry bulkers, and has issued a tender for another four ships, he said. 
Pakistan would initially charter space on container ships “and test the market before we start discussion on how many (container ships) we acquire”, he added. 
Pakistan was also seeking to develop as a port hub for landlocked central Asian coun­­tries, Mr Zaidi said.

2,PPP decries halt to federal funding for provincial uplift projects,Says it is Centre’s constitutional responsibility to provide its share in provincial development projects.,"ISLAMABAD: The opposition Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) has expressed “serious concern” over the federal government’s decision to stop providing funds for provincial development projects and termed it “unconstitutional”. 
PPP vice president Senator Sherry Rehman wrote on her official social media account on Twitter on Tuesday that the federal government, and not the federating units, was responsible for the lack of financial resources in the country. 
“The federal government cannot absolve its constitutional responsibilities simply by transferring its own financial burden on the provinces,” tweeted Ms Rehman, who is also the parliamentary leader of the PPP in the Senate. 

 



 
Her reaction came a day after the Central Development Working Party decided to stop financing provincial development projects, particularly those relating to devolved subjects, to shift to the federating units the financial burden that now stands at above Rs320 billion as part of a new National Development Framework under which the federal government wants to restrict its investment priorities to the areas of federal responsibilities and ensure that the provinces take full fiscal responsibility of all devolved subjects. 

Says it is Centre’s constitutional responsibility to provide its share in provincial development projects

According to the Planning Commission, 16 federal ministries have been devolved along with development projects to the provinces following the 18th Constitution Amendment and abolition of the Concurrent List.  
The financing of projects of provincial nature was discouraged through the federal Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) except for core vertical projects of health and population till 2017. The financial burden on the federal budget, however, kept on increasing despite the fact that the Centre’s fiscal share in divisible pool has shrunk to about 45 per cent from over 57pc under the seventh National Finance Commission award. The provincial projects have since then crept back into the federal PSDP, leaving a limited fiscal space for projects of national importance. 
According to a senior official of the Planning Commission, there are about 331 projects of provincial nature worth Rs1.151 trillion in the PSDP 2021-22. He said the Centre had already spent about Rs345bn on these projects. The Centre now wants the provinces to complete these projects with their own resources. 
Ms Rehman wrote that it was the constitutional responsibility of the Centre to provide its share in development projects in the provinces. 
“It has been proved that the imposed government sitting in Islamabad cannot take the provinces along,” she declared, reminding the federal government that its responsibilities were not limited to Islamabad only, but extended to the whole country. 
“Does this government need to be taught the fundamental principles and the federal responsibilities?” she concluded. 
Meanwhile, information secretary of the PPP and MNA Shazia Marri in a statement said Prime Minister Imran Khan had been making the people fool by pretending to be an honest leader. She alleged that the prime minister was persistently rewarding those who had been running his kitchen and bearing his other expenses. On the other hand, she alleged, Mr Khan had increased burden of inflation on the shoulders of poor masses. 
In an apparent reference to a statement made by a dissident of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, retired Justice Wajihuddin, the MNA said that how a person who had never borne his expenses and never paid school fees of his children could care about other people. She further alleged that Imran Khan had even sold his watch which he had received as a gift during his official visit to a foreign country. 
Ms Marri said the country was facing a critical financial crisis and the nation’s treasury was in the control of the International Monetary Fund.  
She said the country was facing unprecedented inflation while the PTI-led “incompetent” government had planned to prepare a new mini-budget. 
Ms Marri said Prime Minister Khan had forgotten that he would be held accountable by the people whom he had made to cry due to his bad economic policies.

The project loan, denominated in Japanese yen, will finance the construction of the second branch (Choubara) of the Greater Thal Canal irrigation scheme, the ADB said in a statement.  
The main canal and the Mankera branch were constructed by the government of Pakistan in 2009. 
The scheme is expected to provide reliable water supply to 704,000 hectares (around 1.74m acres) of land in Bhakkar, Jhang, Khushab, Layyah and Muzaffargarh districts, making them more agriculturally productive.  
“Given Pakistan’s vulnerability to the impacts of climate change, it is essential to build irrigation infrastructure for climate-resilient and sustainable agriculture,” said Yevgeniy Zhukov, ADB’s director general for Central and West Asia.  
The Asian Bank’s support will help boost the supply of local produce and promote food security while increasing economic growth, he said. Punjab is the main source of food production for Pakistan’s growing population.

5,Nacta drafts first-ever policy to counter violent extremism,Draft policy submitted to interior minister for approval.,"ISLAMABAD: The National Count­e­­r­terrorism Authority (Nacta) has come up with the first-ever National Cou­nter Violent Extremism Policy of Pak­istan (NCVEP 2021) as its draft was submitted to the interior minister on Tuesday.
Nacta’s national coordinator Mehr Khaliq Dad Lak presented the draft policy to Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed for approval.
Before finalising the draft, Nacta said it held provincial consultations with representatives of various segments of society, including academics, journalists, experts and members of civil society, in the past three months.
More than 250 relevant contacts and stakeholders from federal and provincial governments were approached for their contribution and input to the policy. This was in addition to three months of hard work by researchers and experts presently serving in Nacta who worked on the draft. 

Draft policy submitted to interior minister for approval

Nacta had in August helped revise the National Action Plan (NAP) after consultation with stakeholders. As per revised NAP, Nacta was then given the responsibility to formulate a policy to counter violent extremism. The counterterrorism authority finally completed this task and submitted the draft policy to the interior minister for approval.
The draft NCEVP 21 comprises two parts: The first part is the NCVEP 2021 itself while the second part is the national implementation and institutionalisation plan of the policy that clearly mentions the roles and responsibilities of various implementers and their supporting stakeholders along with key performance indicators under policy targets.
Nacta believes the draft NCVEP 2021 is a major national policy document that would keep on evolving and improving with the passage of time.

6,Civil servants’ compensations higher than private sector’s: report,"No reforms in country’s history have yielded significant results, notes think tank.","ISLAMABAD: Challenging a common myth, a leading state-run think tank has concluded that compensations and pensions being received by Pakistan’s civil servants are higher than their private sector counterparts and has called for wide-ranging reforms. 
“Estimates of the total compensation of the civil servants, including monetary wage plus allowances, and quantified in-kind and intangible rewards, show that civil servants are not underpaid since a large chunk is not declared on the salary slip,” said the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE). 
In a study conducted in consultation with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the PIDE notes that various pay and pension commissions took arbitrary decisions for revisions in remunerations and housing and transport facilities are being massively misused by the civil servants. 

No reforms in country’s history have yielded significant results, notes think tank

PIDE Vice Chancellor Nadeem-ul-Haque, a former senior IMF official who previously headed the Planning Commission of Pakistan, taunted the incumbent government on Twitter, saying: “See how @ImranKhanPTI government failed at major reform. @PIDEpk work on civil service incentives is unique.” 
The report says the total cost of a grade-21 officer is estimated to be 12 per cent higher than a UN national officer’s. Non-monetary benefits are much higher in the public sector than in the private sector, with 80pc of the private sector workers having no non-monetary benefits. In contrast, almost 80pc of public sector employees have more than three non-salary benefits. 
Except for an MPhil/PhD degree, there is a wage premium in the public sector at all education levels. Perks are an inefficient form of compensation as they are not linked to performance and efficiency. The World Bureaucracy Indicators of the World Bank estimate that the public sector wages in Pakistan are 53pc higher than the private sector wages. 
The report notes that as civil servants go up grade ladder, the proportion of cash allowances in total pay increases, and so does the proportion of quantified perks in the total cost. Government housing facility, given as an in-kind benefit, is never accounted for in the total cost of the civil servants — something that has a huge opportunity cost to the government. 
For example, the PIDE estimates suggest that the federal housing assets in Islamabad have a market value of about Rs1.45 trillion. “This is the residential value of the assets, and if used for commercial purposes, the value would be significantly higher” and can generate Rs11bn per year in rent. 
“Perks and different allowances add to the total cost of civil servants substantially, and if monetised, would break the myth of low salaries in the public sector,” the report notes. Instead of indexing salaries and developing a proper payment system, the pay and pension commissions’ approach has been to provide arbitrary allowances. 
“These allowances, such as housing and conveyance allowances, are often unrelated to the market conditions. The system causes further disparities when the more powerful service groups can get more plush housing than their counterparts in the occupational groups,” says the report. 
During the country’s history of more than 70 years, 29 commissions were constituted to chalk out a roadmap for civil services reforms, though “not a single one can be attributed to significant outcomes” as most of the reform deliberations merely tinkered with organisational restructuring, minor adjustment of pay scales, creation, merger, or disbanding of occupational groups, and changes in functions and powers. 
While all the reform efforts have failed to improve the performance of the civil service, it has set up a system for “perk-maximisation” and political quid pro quo for perks. The urge or daring for reforms in real essence has always taken a back seat. 
The system causes disparities when more powerful cadres get more allowances and perks than the others. The provision of perks instead of cash has long been recognised to distort employees’ incentives.  
The report notes that not all service groups have equal opportunities for career progression. “Each civil service cadre is organised vertically into a pyramid, but on top of each, we usually see an officer from only two cadres — the Public Administrative Services and the Secretariat Group. The technical and professional staff are restricted both vertically and horizontally.” 
The report describes pay and performance disconnect as the major problem and notes that the promotion and placement policies are not aimed at rewarding those who perform well and are capable of taking higher responsibilities. Wage overlaps accentuate this disconnect when people in a lower grade get the same pay as those above. 
The report notes that the public sector pension system in Pakistan is rather generous. Although pension is calculated as 70pc of the last drawn basic salary at the time of retirement, if the raises granted by successive governments are included, it increases pension to 122pc-140pc of their last drawn basic salary in some cases. On average, a person who serves in the government for 25 years or more draws a pension until he turns 80. After his death, at least 13 heirs can claim family pension, including wife, unmarried daughter, underage children, widowed daughter, divorced daughter and disabled child. 
Pakistan’s public sector pension system is also generous when compared to pension in the private sector.

8,PPP declares support for Gwadar rights movement,"“The people of Gwadar have the same rights the people of Islamabad have,” says Nayyar Bukhari.","GWADAR: A delegation of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) recently visited venue of the around month-long Gwadar sit-in and expressed solidarity with its participants.
The Gwadar sit-in’s participants have been protesting for around a month, demanding for their basic rights under the Constitution.
The PPP delegation comprised some central leaders of the party, including Nayyar Bukhari, Syed Khurshid Shah, Farhatullah Babar, Qadir Patel, Mir Changez Khan Jamali and Saeed Ghani. They announced PPP’s support for the protest of the people and their demands.  
They said former president Asif Ali Zardari and PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had directed them to visit Gwadar and announce the party’s support for the people of Gwadar.
Speaking on the occasion, Mr Bukhari said every citizen in the country has rights under the Constitution. “The people of Gwadar have the same rights the people of Islamabad have,” he said. Similarly, he said, the people of Balochistan had the same rights as the people of Punjab, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Khurshid Shah said the sit-in had highlighted the problems of the people of Gwadar. He said the PPP government had given an NFC award that did not consider only the population for distribution of resources. The PPP government had increased the grant of Balochistan from Rs47 billion to Rs110bn. He said it is very unfortunate that resources and funds for Balochistan are not being used for its people.
He said through 18th Amendment the PPP government had made the chief minister of Balochistan the chairman of the Gwadar port’s Board of Governor.
“PPP stands with you for the rights of the people of Gwadar,” Khurshid Shah said, adding that the call for resuming trade activities in the border areas of Balochistan is a legitimate demand and that the government must ensure resumption of trade activities in the province’s border areas to protect the livelihoods of the local people.
He said it was the PPP government which gave the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project to the country. The people of Balochistan should be given their due share in the economic corridor project, he added.
Maulana Hidayatur Rehman, who is leading the protest, warmly welcomed the PPP delegation by giving its members traditional chadars. He thanked the PPP leaders for extending support to the Gwadar rights movement.

Speaking to members of the Korangi Association of Trade and Industry (KATI), he said that welfare of employees was the top priority of the government and EOBI would solve problems of industrialists.  
He said that a committee would be formed after consultation with representatives of the government, industrialists, employees and EOBI officials to resolve problems of industrialists.  
He said that harassment of industrialists would not be tolerated as EOBI wanted the country’s industries to progress so that employment opportunities were created for the masses. 
According to KATI’s press release, the EOBI chairman said that the perception that more payments were made from contributing industries was wrong.  
KATI President Salman Aslam said a large number of employees came to Korangi Industrial Area for employment, but their dues were not paid by EOBI while a huge amount was also deducted.  
He said that complaints had also been received from industrialists that EOBI officials were harassing them. 
Korangi Industrial Trading Estate CEO Zubair Chhaya said that EOBI should appoint its focal person in KATI to solve problems of the Korangi industry. He suggested that EOBI should announce an amnesty scheme to enable industrialists to pay their dues to EOBI. 
Former President of KATI Zahid Saeed said that EOBI should include new industries to increase the fund so that no further burden was placed on industrialists who were already making contribution to EOBI.  
He called for a solution of litigation between EOBI and industrialists.

He said the Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd (SSGCL) is playing a hide-and-seek game with the all industries especially corrugated carton units which are the backbone of the national economy. “Without corrugated industry, all the exports and local supplies can be stuck up,” he asserted. 
He said the argument of gas shortage is not valid because the SSGCL should have made arrangements before the start of winter season.   
Mr Mirza said the corrugated carton units do not have any other source to obtain gas supply or any other source for continuation of their production because this industry belongs to SMEs. 
While rejecting the gas suspension to all non-export industries, SITE Association of Industries President  Abdul Rasheed urged the SSGCL to carry out staggered gas holidays with better load management to provide relief to the general industrial community providing livelihood to millions of people.
He said the general industries are supplying essential raw materials to export-oriented industries hence are an integral part of the supply chain and must stay operational otherwise the export sector even with gas would not be able to maintain the pace of exports.
He feared shortage of essential goods as well as increase in goods’ prices due to gas suspension to general industries.
