0,ADB sees higher than estimated inflation in Pakistan,"Energy tariffs adjustments, higher global commodity prices are likely to exert upward pressure on domestic prices.","ISLAMABAD: The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has forecast higher than estimated inflation in Pakistan mainly because of increase in energy rates and higher domestic commodity prices due to higher global commodity prices.  
In its Asian Development Outlook (ADO) Supplement, the Manila-based lending agency also lowered economic growth forecast for South Asia to 8.6 per cent, from its earlier projection of 8.8pc, and increased inflation forecast to 5.9pc, up from 5.8pc rate of inflation it had earlier estimated for current year.  
“Much of the forecast upgrade reflects a higher projection for Pakistan, where adjustments to energy tariffs and higher global commodity prices are expected to exert upward pressure on domestic prices,” reported the ADO supplement without actually projecting an inflation number. 

Energy tariffs adjustments, higher global commodity prices likely to exert upward pressure on domestic prices

In September, however, the ADB had estimated inflation for Pakistan at 8.9pc for current fiscal year and 7.5pc for FY22. The ADB also noted that cotton and sugarcane production in Pakistan increased with favorable weather, while services bounced back as mobility tracking measures recovered beyond levels in March 2020 before the pandemic. 
The report said South Asia was forecast to expand less than projected in its September Update for 2021, reflecting a modest downward revision to forecast GDP growth in India with manufacturing now projected to grow more slowly than anticipated in the update. 
In contrast, other economies in the region have benefitted from higher global demand and rebounding domestic activity with Covid-19 largely contained across the sub-region – South Asia. On balance, the GDP growth forecast for the sub-region in 2021 is lowered from 8.8pc in the update to 8.6pc and maintained at 7pc in 2022. 
In India, a strong 20.1pc growth rebound in first quarter of fiscal year 2021 was followed in second quarter by growth moderation to 8.4pc, marginally below expectations as a chip shortage hindered the production and sale of automobiles and many electronic goods. GDP growth nevertheless remained strong, driven by growth in private consumption at 8.6pc and in investment at 17.2pc. 
On the supply side, growth in India was broad based driven by strong expansion in services, particularly public administration, defense and mining. Agriculture remained resilient at 4.5pc growth, while manufacturing growth moderated to 5.5pc. Supply chain factors such as chip shortages and rising semiconductor prices will continue to suppress economic growth, as reflected in double-digit contraction in motor vehicle sales in October and in e-way bills in November 2021. 
In Bangladesh, exports and imports grew more than projected in the update thanks to a surge in global demand for clothing. Faster import growth widened the trade deficit, but growth will be supported by private investment with imports of capital machinery and raw materials for garments. 
Maldives attracted over one million tourist arrivals from January to October, an increase of 139.3pc over the year-earlier period. With the rebound in tourism expected to continue through the peak season in fourth quarter, the 2021 GDP growth forecast is revised up, while the projection for 2022 is maintained. 
In Sri Lanka, GDP grew by 12.3pc in second quarter, bringing growth in the first half of the year to 8.0pc, surpassing earlier expectations with improvement in all sectors. However, Sri Lankan growth prospects for 2022 are dampened by macroeconomic headwinds as reserves have declined and significant external debt repayments are due in 2022.

1,"London court rejects SNGPL’s claims against operator of two 1,200MW RLNG power plants",Orders gas firm to pay back withheld amount with interest.,"LAHORE:  Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd (SNGPL) faced a major defeat at an  international legal forum after its claims of billions of rupees in two  different petitions against the state-owned National Power Parks  Management Company Ltd (NPPMCL) were rejected by the London Court of  International Arbitration (LCIA) this week. 
However, the SNGPL terming the NPPMCL’s claims misleading stated that arbitration and awards are private and confidential. According to NPPMCL, which operates two 1,200-megawatt  RLNG-based power plants in Punjab, situated in Haveli Bahadur Shah,  Jhang and Balloki, Sheikhupura and procures RLNG for power generation  from SNGPL, the disputes arose when, in May 2018, the SNGPL raised ‘take  or pay’ invoices against NPPMCL and subsequently proceeded to recover  Rs10.37 billion from the gas supply deposit maintained by NPPMCL under  its Gas Supply Agreements (GSAs). 

Orders gas firm to pay back withheld amount with interest

Disputing SNGPL’s claims, the  NPPMCL contested the assertions of SNGPL on multiple forums and  ultimately submitted the disputes for final resolution to LCIA as per  the agreed mechanism under the GSAs. 
“The LCIA issued its final  awards related to these disputes earlier this week, holding that the  documents produced by SNGPL in support of its claims “are little more  than self-serving evidence”. 
“The LCIA also held that SNGPL wrongly drew  down the amount of approximately Rs10.37bn and directed SNGPL to pay the  same to NPPMCL with interest from the date of recovery until full  payment, which amounts to approximately Rs15.3bn,” the NPPMCL claims  while quoting the verdict of the reference.
In addition, the LCIA  also dismissed the counterclaims raised by SNGPL against NPPMCL,  including an additional claim of Rs4.38bn, and noted that SNGPL had  failed to discharge “its burden of proving their quantum.” The final  hearing for the LCIA arbitrations initiated by the NPPMCL took place  from Sept 20 to Sept 25. The hearing was attended by officials of NPPMCL  and SNGPL and witnesses including some power and gas sector experts.
The  SNGPL says that there are various misleading reports circulating  regarding two arbitration awards involving SNGPL and NPPMCL. “The NPPMCL  is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the federal government. The SNGPL will  not violate the confidentiality commitment enshrined in the relevant  rules; however, it has been constrained to respond given the ongoing  speculation. SNGPL intends to fully explore and avail all legal remedies  which are available to it and is consulting with its counsels in this  regard,” it explains.
It said under the terms of the license  granted to SNGPL by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) read  with the decision of ECC of the cabinet dated May 11, 2018 and in line  with the tariff regime in vogue, the company after exhausting all the  legal remedies available under the law, will take up the matter with  Ogra for determining the impact of the awards on revenue requirement of  the Company. 
“Since the relevant awards relate to ‘take or pay’ revenues  and since these revenues billed to NPPMCL were earlier offered to Ogra  as an operating revenue, the reversal of the same, if any, may not have  any material adverse impact on the profitability of the company,” the  SNGPL said.

2,Ogra proposes up to Rs10.30 cut in petroleum prices,Sources say the working paper on the prices of petroleum products from Ogra has been delivered to the Ministry of Finance.,"ISLAMABAD: For a change, the prices of petroleum products may go down by up to Rs10.30 per litre for the next fortnight on Wednesday if the calculations of the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) are accepted by the government.
Petroleum Division sources said the working paper on the prices of petroleum products from the Ogra had been delivered to the Ministry of Finance. The paper on pricing is based on existing petroleum levy and general sales tax rates, import parity price and commissions for dealers and OMCs.
According to the working paper, the regulator has calculated Rs10.30 and Rs8.65 per litre reduction in the ex-depot prices of petrol and high-speed diesel, respectively.

Petrol, diesel to carry extra Rs1.70 and Rs1.54 charge 

However, a senior official told Dawn that the finance ministry was working on a revised paper in consultation with the Petroleum Division to add an additional charge of Rs1.70 and Rs1.54 on petrol and diesel, respectively, on account of increase in commission for dealers and oil marketing companies under an agreement reached early this month.
Therefore, the ex-depot price of petrol and diesel were estimated to come down by Rs8.60 and Rs7.10 per litre, respectively.
Officials said the prices of petroleum products would have seen greater reduction but the impact of decline in international market was partially offset by devaluation of the rupee during the last fortnight.
It would be the first price cut after Sept 1 when the price of petrol and HSD stood at Rs118.30 and Rs115.03 per litre respectively. The prices have since been going up soaring to Rs145.82 for petrol and Rs142.62 per litre for diesel.
As of now, the government is charging Rs2.34 per litre general sales tax on petrol and Rs9.80 per litre on diesel. It is also charging Rs13.62 per litre petroleum levy on petrol and Rs13.15 per litre on diesel. In addition, Rs11.33 per litre customs/deemed duty on petrol and Rs10.45 per litre on are diesel being collected.
As such, the government’s per litre revenue on petrol works out at Rs27.30 per litre and Rs33.38 per litre on HSD at present.
The government has given an undertaking to the International Monetary Fund to increase petroleum levy on both petrol and HSD by Rs4 per litre every month to attain Rs30 per litre maximum permissible under the law. Until last year, the government used to charge up to Rs30 per litre petroleum levy on HSD and petrol and Rs6-8 per litre on kerosene and light diesel.

The Chinese company plans to initially arrange for assembly of two SUVs — Tiggo 4 Pro and 8 Pro — with eight dealers across Pakistan. The assembly plant, which is being set up at Port Qasim, will have the capacity of 16,000 units a year which would be increased to 32,000 units a year.  
Sales of the first locally-built vehicles are expected to begin in Pakistan within the ongoing fiscal year.   Ghandhara’s investment of $10 million over the first four years would provide the industry with a much-needed financial boost as well as help expand a retail network and create job opportunities, a press release said.   
Currently, Pakistan’s automotive industry accou­nts for almost nearly four per cent of the GDP. Chery’s Executive Vice President Charlie Zhang said the company’s entrance into Pakistan’s automotive market represents a significant step for China-Pakistan economic growth. 
With the close collaboration and support of the Pakistani government, this will deliver sustainable benefits for the national economy, customers, partners and Chery, he said. 
General Manager Pakis­tan Chery Felix Hu said after the start of local assembly, the company aims to export SUVs to Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.

4,Eight listings  raise Rs20bn in 2021,It is the highest number of offerings in a year since 2015.,"KARACHI: As many as eight companies went public in 2021, which is the highest number of offerings in a year since 2015.
The newly listed firms raised Rs20 billion from the general public, according to a research note released by Topline Securities on Tuesday.
Six of these listings were on the main board of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) while two were on the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) counter, which is reserved for smaller and riskier firms.
There were eight offerings in 2015, which raised a total of Rs116bn. The sum was unusually huge that year because of a secondary offering of Habib Bank Ltd shares by the federal government that alone generated Rs102bn.
Each of the eight offerings in the outgoing year received “immense enthusiasm” and was oversubscribed.
The brokerage said Octopus Digital Ltd has posted the highest return (46 per cent) among the eight listings so far. It was followed by Citi Pharma Ltd, which appreciated 5pc. On the other hand, the maiden listing on the GEM counter, Pak Agro Packaging Ltd, has posted a decline of 35pc. Panther Tyres Ltd has also posted a decline of 33pc.
“These offerings saw huge investor interest despite dull performance by the KSE-100 index, which saw a 2pc decline in rupee terms and 12pc in dollar terms in 2021 to date,” it added.
As for the outlook, the brokerage said the PSX will continue to see new offerings in 2022 if the macroeconomic situation stabilises following the resumption of the International Monetary Fund’s loan programme.

5,Commerce ministry yet to notify Strategic Trade Policy Framework,A well-placed source says the policy's file is pending in Prime Minister Secretariat for the last month.,"ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of Commerce has yet to notify the Strategic Trade Policy Framework 2020-25 despite a lapse of more than a month.
The framework — approved by the federal cabinet on Nov 9 after a delay of more than two years — envisages measures to enhance Pakistani enterprises’ capacity to produce, distribute and sell products more efficiently than their competitors.
The file of the policy was pending in Prime Minister Secretariat for the last one month, a well-placed source told Dawn, adding: “The file was sent the very next day after the cabinet’s meeting.”
This is the fourth strategic framework announced by the government since 2009. It allocates Rs45 billion to be spent in the next five years on giving subsidies and taking other support measures for non-textile sectors.
Unlike the past frameworks, the government this time has not announced an export target linked with the support being given to the sectors.
According to another source, the textile division had sent the textile and clothing policy to the Economic Coordination Committee of the federal cabinet for approval. This policy has also been submitted several times but is yet to be approved.
Earlier, the commerce division notified three policy frameworks — for 2009-12, 2012-15 and 2015-18 — but none of them could achieve its objectives, especially the export targets, due to various reasons. The previous frameworks also failed to alter the export paradigm.
The draft Textile and Apparel Policy 2020-25 is laden with cash subsidies and lower rates on utilities to boost the production and export of value-added textile products. The support for the textile sector runs in billions of rupees, especially under the head of subsiding utility costs.
Another scheme —regarding the payment of drawback of local taxes and levy — is also awaiting the federal cabinet’s approval. The scheme is simply a cash subsidy on export proceeds from the country.
The State Bank of Pakistan will also offer hefty incentives to entrepreneurs and the scheme will be made part of the textile policy. It has been proposed to allocate a hefty amount for the Export Finance Scheme and Long-Term Financing Facility.
The focus of the policy framework 2020-25 will be on geographical and product diversification, the reduction of manufacturing costs through tariff rationalisation, the pursuit of regional connectivity, the ‘Look Africa’ policy, and enhancement of market access through free trade and preferential trade agreements.
The framework will also focus on facilitating logistics and tracking under the International Road Transports (TIR) Convention and enhancing regional connectivity for access to Central Asian countries, Turkey and Iran, and through them to Europe and Russia.
