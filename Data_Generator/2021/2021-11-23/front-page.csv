• Fiscal adjustment requires cut in uplift funds, increase in tax target, Rs4 per litre monthly hike in petroleum levy
• Tarin says govt to ensure parliamentary approval to grant SBP autonomy
• IMF wants audit of Covid funds, names of contractors 
ISLAMABAD: The government on Monday committed to introducing a supplementary budget as part of an agreement with the International Mone­tary Fund (IMF) for a net fiscal adjustment of almost Rs550 billion during the remaining part of the current fiscal year through a 22 per cent cut in development funds, about Rs300bn increase in tax target and a Rs4 per litre monthly hike in petroleum levy on major petroleum products.
Making an upfront announcement about ‘five prior actions’ to secure approval of the IMF board for disbursement of about $1.06bn and revival of the Fund programme in January, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance and Revenue Shaukat Tarin said the government would also ensure “approval” of parliament to grant autonomy on matters of monetary policy, exchange rate and recruitments to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) that would remain answerable to parliament as it is now.
Speaking at a joint news conference with Energy Minister Hammad Azhar, Mr Tarin said the government would also get completed the post-facto audit of Covid-related expenditures and make public the beneficial owners of suppliers of vaccines and related procurements as part of the IMF agreement.
As such, five prior actions he listed include about Rs350bn worth of general sales tax exemptions through supplementary finance bill, Rs4 per litre increase in petroleum levy every month, autonomy to the SBP, audit of Covid-19 funds and declaration of their beneficial owners and Rs200bn reduction in the Public Sector Development Programme to Rs700bn. About Rs50bn cut has also been imposed on grants.
The revenue target has now been set at Rs6.1 trillion instead of Rs5.8tr in the original budget for 2021-22, Mr Tarin said, adding that the Federal Board of Revenue had already collected Rs225bn higher than the target in the first four months of the current fiscal year. The IMF was, however, unimpressed by the revenue collection and wanted implementation of policy actions to remove distortions like different GST rates for various sectors, he added.
Earlier in the morning, the IMF said its staff and the Pakistani authorities had “reached a staff-level agreement on policies and reforms needed to complete the sixth review” under the $6bn Extended Fund Facility (EFF). “The agreement is subject to approval by the Executive Board, following the implementation of prior actions, notably on fiscal and institutional reforms,” it added.
This will enable disbursement of $1.059bn, bringing total disbursements under the EFF to about $3.027bn.
An official said the legislative part of the IMF deal — SBP amendment bill and supplementary finance bill for withdrawal of tax exemptions — would be introduced in parliament next week.
Shaukat Tarin said the IMF board meeting would be called after Xmas holidays, most probably on January 12, to approve the agreement and the authorities would have the time until then to complete prior actions and ensure approval of the SBP amendment law by parliament.
He said the government would increase the rate of petroleum levy to Rs30 per litre through monthly increase of Rs4 to secure Rs356bn against a budgeted target of Rs610bn which was no more achievable.
Without directly naming former finance adviser Dr Hafeez Shaikh and incumbent SBP Governor Dr Baqir Reza, Mr Tarin said the IMF talks had prolonged because “we started the journey from where it was left in March-April with a commitment to withdraw Rs700bn tax exemptions, Rs4.95 per unit increase in electricity tariff and autonomy to the SBP against the constitutional previsions”.
“Let bygone be bygone, we have tackled whatever was wrong,” he said while responding to a question about accountability for such tough conditions as some of them were against the Constitution.
Mr Tarin said he remained steadfast against increasing taxes and energy tariff like a pyramid because that would have made the industry uncompetitive and affected the common man. He said he also insisted on ‘rationalising’ the SBP law in a manner that it was not seen an outside institution. “The IMF team was in a fix because we had made commitments and got $500 million and it was difficult for them to go back to the IMF board to justify why commitments were made when these were against the Constitution.”
The adviser said the team of officials he led was “not experienced” as some people described them unlike ‘experienced teams’ earlier, but they worked hard and “succeeded in major relaxations through give and take”. He said he was able to protect agriculture, tractors, food items, pesticides from sales tax, besides increase in tax rates and slabs for income tax and tax on provident fund. “Instead of Rs700bn worth of fiscal adjustment, we were able to save almost half and brought it down to Rs350bn,” he said.
Mr Tarin said he fully supported the SBP independence and its accountability as was for judges and other similar institutions. The central bank should not look like an alien institution and the applicability of accountability through the National Accountability Bureau or the Federal Investigation Agency would be like on it was the prime minister, parliamentarians and judges.
Additionally, there would be no monetary and fiscal policy board where the finance secretary used to have a say, but this has now to be replaced with a liaison between the finance minister and the SBP governor.
Responding to a question, Mr Tarin said the government would appoint the SBP governor and board of directors who would be completely free in monetary policy decisions, exchange rate adjustments and price determination. The governor and the board would have the powers to appoint deputy governors and the finance ministry would have no role in approving foreign visits of deputy governors and other senior officials.
Mr Tarin said the economic growth exceeded the government’s expectations in the first four months of the current fiscal year owing to expansionary fiscal and monetary policies and both the central bank and the government would now tighten them up as the economy had started overheating and such a growth rate was unsustainable. The SBP, he said, had already started mopping up excess money in the market through cash margins and monetary policy that would also slow down inflation.
Energy Minister Hammad Azhar said the base power tariff would not be increased for the time being and seasonal winter tariff and industrial support tariff of Rs12.96 for domestic, commercial and industrial consumers would remain protected.
The IMF appreciated the government for policy actions during Covid-19 period and as required under the Fund programme, but warned that external pressures had started emerging and needed to be addressed.
These include widening of the current account deficit and depreciation pressures on the exchange rate — mainly reflecting the compound effects of the stronger economic activity, an expansionary macroeconomic policy mix, and higher international commodity prices. In response, the authorities have started adjusting policies, including by gradually unwinding Covid-related stimulus measures.

1,PM Imran okays Rs5bn humanitarian aid for Afghanistan,Allows transportation of Indian food assistance through Pakistan.,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Monday approved Rs5 billion humanitarian aid for Afghanistan, besides allowing transportation of Indian food assistance for the war-torn country through Pakistan.
The decision was taken at the first meeting of the apex committee of the newly established Afghanistan Inter-Ministerial Coordination Cell (AICC). PM Khan chaired the meeting that was attended by Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Adviser on Finance Shaukat Tarin, Chief of the Army Staff Gen Qamar Bajwa, National Security Adviser Dr Moeed Yousuf and senior civil and military officers.
The PM Office said that the prime minister “ordered immediate shipment of in-kind humanitarian assistance worth Rs5 billion”.

 



 
The aid would include food commodities including 50,000 tonnes of wheat, emergency medical supplies and winter shelters, according to the PMO. A delegation of health officials from Afghanistan will visit Islamabad later this week to work out modalities for Pakistan’s support to Afghanistan’s health sector.

Allows transportation of Indian food assistance through Pakistan

The assistance approved by the prime minister was earlier announced on October 1 during the visit of FM Qureshi to Kabul for meeting with the Taliban leaders.
Humanitarian supplies are already being transported from Pakistan to Afghanistan almost on daily basis since September.
United Nations’ Special Representative for Afghanistan Deborah Lyons had on Thursday warned that the country was “on the brink of a humanitarian catastrophe” with nearly 60 per cent of its population expected to face extreme level of hunger.
The food emergency is expected to aggravate over the winter.
The participants of the meeting, while expressing concern about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Afghanistan, vowed not to abandon the Afghans in their time of need.
Mr Khan urged the international community of fulfill its “collective responsibility” to help Afghanistan stave off the impending humanitarian crisis.
He announced the government’s decision to permit 50,000 MT of wheat India had offered to Afghanistan as humanitarian assistance to go through Pakistan after finalisation of modalities.
“Pakistan will also facilitate the return of Afghan patients who had gone to India for medical treatment and are stuck there,” he further said.
While directing the ministries to extend maximum facilitation to Afghans, the prime minister said that it had been agreed in principle to reduce tariff and sales tax on key Afghan exports to Pakistan.
This would help support Afghanistan’s economy. Since Taliban takeover in August this year, imports from Afghanistan to Pakistan are higher than exports from Pakistan to Afghanistan.
Mr Khan instructed that no arbitrary closures of borders for trade should be allowed.
He further ordered revival of bus service between Peshawar and Jalalabad for facilitating cross-border travel. Measures for facilitating visas for Afghanistan were also approved.
The prime minister ordered that the facility of free Covid-19 vaccination for the Afghans entering Pakistan from land borders be continued. Pakistan has initiated free vaccination of the Afghans since November 13.
NSA Moeed Yusuf was asked to visit Afghanistan for exploring specific areas where immediate capacity building support was required by the Afghans.
Mr Yusuf, who is also the convener of AICC briefed the civil and military leadership on the current economic situation in Afghanistan and the progress made by the AICC in coordinating national efforts for humanitarian assistance and border facilitation for Afghans.

2,IHC appoints aides in social media rules case,Justice Athar Minallah asks whether recent social media rules have been framed in accordance with best international practice.,"ISLAMABAD: The Islam­abad High Court (IHC) on Monday appointed representatives of the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) and Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) and digital media experts as amici curiae in a case related to social media rules.
IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah asked digital media experts Sadaf Baig, Nighat Dad, Fareeha Aziz, Rafay Baloch and representatives of the PBC and the PFUJ to apprise the court whether the social media rules were contradictory to the constitutional provisions or not.
Additional Attorney General Qasim Wadud informed the court that the attorney general had consulted the stakeholders on the social media rules as per the court’s directives.
He said that the Prime Minister Imran Khan had constituted a committee, headed by federal Minister for Human Rights Dr Shireen Mazari, to review the social media rules which had held consultative sessions with over 30 stakeholders. The committee had also held discussions with managements of leading social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and other international forums in connection with the rules, he added.
“Where on earth an authority conducts moral policing,” questioned Justice Minallah.
Referring to recent ban on short video sharing application TikTok, he asked for what reason the app had been suspended in Pakistan.
Mr Wadud told the court that ban on TikTok had been lifted.
The IHC Chief Justice remarked that imposing ban on social network applications was not a permanent solution and prima facie the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority misused the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act.
Justice Minallah asked whether the recent social media rules had been framed in accordance with the best international practice.
The counsel for the petitioner claimed that numerous objections had been raised against the new social media rules.
The additional attorney general said that as per his knowledge, some European countries and Australia had suspended social media applications over non-conformity of the rules.
The court asked the amici curiae to review the social media rules and submit a report.
Further hearing in this matter has been adjourned till Jan 6.

3,Central bank wants savings accounts profit rate hiked to 7.25pc,Asks customers to file a complaint with their bank if it gives less profit on the savings account.,"KARACHI: The profit rate on savings accounts will rise by 1.5 percentage points to a minimum of 7.25 per cent by Dec 1, the State Bank said on Monday.
The announcement came after the central bank raised the policy rate last week to 8.75pc from 7.25pc.
The central bank through a social media platform also asked customers to file a complaint with their bank if it gives less profit on the savings account.
In case of non-compliance by the bank, the SBP asked the depositors to contact its customer complaint help desk.
For opening a savings account, the SBP informed the customers to visit the bank of their choice. From January 2022, it has been made mandatory for banks to provide the option to open bank accounts digitally with remote biometric verification and without the need for a customer to visit a bank branch.
The SBP also clarified that the inflation forecast is 5pc to 7pc for the current fiscal year and not 7pc to 9pc as being interpreted in some sections of the media.
“In some sections of the media, SBP’s average inflation forecast of 7-9pc in FY22 is being interpreted as the ‘inflation target’ and being compared to the inflation targets of other countries. This is incorrect,” the central bank said in a press release on Monday.
“SBP’s inflation forecast represents our projections for the current fiscal year. On the other hand, Pakistan’s inflation target is set by the government and is 5 – 7pc. This target is to be achieved over the medium term,” the SBP said. “Monetary policy is anchored on achieving the government’s inflation target over the medium term, i.e. over the next 18-24 months.”
Fahad Rauf of Ismail Iqbal Securities said the inflation targeting regime, as indicated by the IMF, would be the focus of the central bank in making monetary decisions.
The SBP amendment bill, which is yet to materialise, also highlights the central bank’s objectives like price stability, financial stability and economic development, he said.
Mr Rauf was of the view that considering current inflation outlook, interest rate would increase by another 100-150bps to achieve mildly positive rates.

4,PML-N seeks answers as ex-CJP terms clip fake,Party says verdict against Nawaz has no legal grounds,"LAHORE: The PML-N has asked former chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) Saqib Nisar to come clean about a leaked audio clip of a conversation purportedly between him and an unidentified man regarding the conviction of former premier Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz, though the former CJP has claimed that the voice in the clip is not his.
Taking to Twitter on Monday, PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif said: “The emergence of a new audio clip of former Chief Justice (Saqib Nisar) shows how Nawaz Sharif & Maryam Nawaz were targeted as part of a grand scheme to keep them out of political process.”
While talking to Dawn.com, Justice Nisar termed the audio clip fabricated, adding: “I have never spoken to the person in the audio call.”
The FactFocus website that broke the story about the audio quotes Mr Nisar as saying he had never contacted any accountability court judge to order them to announce a verdict against Nawaz Sharif or Maryam. “Why would I do that?” Mr Nisar asked, according to the website’s report. “I have no grudges against Mian Nawaz Sharif.”

Party says verdict against Nawaz has no legal grounds

The former CJP also said that no one from the army or the Inter-Services Intelligence had ever contacted him or pressured him in connection with the case, the website stated.
On the other hand, Shehbaz Sharif tweeted that time had come to right the wrongs inflicted on his elder brother and niece. “The nation looks forward to justice system,” he said.
In the audio clip, a voice, allegedly Mr Nisar’s, can be heard saying: “Let me be a little blunt about it. Unfortunately, here it is the institutions that dictate judgements. In this case, we will have to punish Mian sahab (Nawaz Sharif). [I] have been told `we have to bring Khan sahab (Imran Khan) [into power]’.”
He allegedly goes on to add in the conversation, “Punishment will have to be given.”
When the man on the other end of the line says Maryam “doesn’t merit a sentence”, Saqib Nisar purportedly tells him: “You are absolutely correct. I talked to my friends that something should be done about this but they did not agree. There will be no independence of the judiciary. So, let it be.”
As the audio leak remained the top trend on social media, the PML-N asked the former CJP to explain his position on it. The party’s secretary general, Ahsan Iqbal, termed the leak “serious stuff”. “Former CJ Saqib Nisar has to explain his position. These tapes provide evidence to what was an open secret in Islamabad,” he tweeted.
Former federal information minister Pervaiz Rashid said: “The one [Nisar] who is refusing to recognise his voice today will reject his written judgements too tomorrow.”
PML-N information secretary Marriyum Aurangzeb said that after the surfacing of Mr Nisar’s “confession audio clip”, PML-N Quaid Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz’s sentences had no legal or judicial grounds.
“This confession of Nisar has vindicated Nawaz and Maryam. God Almighty has his ways of ensuring that truth prevails and that’s exactly what happened. In the light of these revelations, Saqib Nisar and all those involved in this grand conspiracy must be booked under treason [law],” she demanded.
PML-N Punjab information secretary Azma Bokhari alleged that like Imran Khan, Mr Nisar was also a pawn. “For the respect of the judiciary, it is necessary that Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz be acquitted,” she demanded.
