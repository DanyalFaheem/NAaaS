1,Khokhar suggests moving no-trust motion against Sanjrani,Says move will expose those who ditch opposition during the secret ballot.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Senator Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar has suggested to the opposition that it should move another no-confidence motion against Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani to test the loyalty of those members sitting on the opposition benches as well as the forces which immediately come into action to convert a majority into a minority.
“Politically, it is a good opportunity for making such a political move. It will have many benefits. We have a majority [in Senate] but it was converted into a minority. We will come to know if such an attempt is made again or not,” said Mr Khokhar while informally talking to a select group of reporters here on Monday.
Secondly, he said, the move would also expose those people who were sitting on the opposition benches but always ditched it on crucial occasions as it happened at the time of recent joint sitting of parliament and the Senate when the government managed to get the crucial bills passed through manipulation.
Moreover, Mr Khokhar said if the move succeeded then it would open other avenues like moving a similar no-trust motion against Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar and this would help the opposition in pushing the government back.

Says move will expose those who ditch opposition during secret ballot

In August 2019, Sadiq Sanjrani had survived a no-confidence motion in the opposition-dominated house when 14 senators ditched the opposition during the secret ballot.
Commenting on the opposition’s defeat in the Senate on four bills on November 19, Mr Khokhar said it happened “primarily due to the opposition’s own mistake”. He said that during the crucial sitting, neither the opposition leader was present in the house nor the parliamentary leaders of other opposition parties, including the PML-N and JUI-F, were there. He said the government had very intelligently taken advantage of the situation and got the bills passed from the house where the opposition had a clear majority.
In his apparent reference to the six independents led by independent Senator Dilawar Khan, the PPP senator regretted that there was a group of people who sat on the opposition benches but they never voted with the opposition on crucial occasions.
“These people come to the opposition-fold when they are to get some benefits and then they vote for the government to get benefit from it as well,” he said, while asking the leadership of his own party to reconsider its decision to seek the support of the six-man independent group which the party had sought at the time of nomination of Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani as the opposition leader in the Senate.
Mr Khokhar said these people were getting double benefits as they were already enjoying chairmanship of five committees on the opposition’s quota.
All of these six independent senators elected in 2018 had been sitting on the treasury benches before the Senate elections in March and all of a sudden they submitted an application to the Senate chairman seeking allocation of seats on the opposition benches. They later informed the chairman that they wanted to support Mr Gilani for the office of the opposition leader for which the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) had already nominated Azam Nazeer Tarar.
Interestingly, all these independents had voted for Mr Sanjrani in the elections, only days before their decision to sit on the opposition benches.
Other members of the independents’ group are Ahmed Khan, Kauda Babar and Naseebullah Bazai from Balochistan and Hidayatullah Khan and Hilalur Rehman from the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata).
Senator Khokhar is among those members of the PPP who want the party leadership to take action against these six independents who had ditched the opposition during the crucial voting on the electoral reforms and other bills in the joint sitting of parliament and then in the Senate.
When other PPP legislators are expressing the same views in their private conversations, Mr Khokhar is the only party leader who is saying it openly that the party leadership should find out if the support of these senators has been beneficial or harmful to the party.
It may be recalled that Mr Khokhar had resigned as official spokesman for party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari in February without officially citing any reason.
Leader of the Opposition in the Senate Yousuf Raza Gilani, while commenting on the situation, had stated that the decision to seek the support of these independents had been made by the party with a “majority vote” and that any decision about the future relationship with these independents would also be made by the leadership.
Justifying their act of supporting the government in parliament, the head of the independents’ group, Dilawar Khan, had stated that they had voted for the electoral reforms bills because no one from the opposition had approached them for a support. On the other hand, he said, a number of treasury members had begged before them for the support.

2,PPP wants details of IMF deal disclosed,PPP Senator Sherry Rehman deplores parliament has not been taken into confidence on macroeconomic decisions.,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakis­tan Peoples Party (PPP) has called upon the government to disclose details of a ‘secret’ agreement with the Inter­national Monetary Fund (IMF).
The party’s parliamentary leader in Senate Sherry Rehman said the PTI government’s deal with the IMF had been shrouded in secrecy and uncertainty.
She regretted that the parliament had not been taken into confidence while crucial macroeconomic decisions were being undertaken.
“The parliament has been kept in the dark about the harsh conditions the government has agreed to with the IMF. It is no longer shocking that the government is celebrating the deal with the IMF because it has become tone deaf to the Pakistani street, but it has conveniently buried the terms of hard conditions that will be transferred to the people of the country.

Deplores parliament has not been taken into confidence on macroeconomic decisions

“Struggling to keep their head above the economic water, families have been unable to recover from continuous price bombs being dropped on them by the PTI government. Now, this latest deal with the IMF has left the entire nation with severe financial and economic whiplash. This level of indebtedness, profligacy and burden of prices on each household has never been seen in the country before,” the PPP leader said.
Condemning the newly announced mini-budget, she said: “The new mini-budget imposed on the people of Pakistan will exacerbate the impoverishment levels in the country. It is clear now that the one per cent elite that is out of touch with 99pc of Pakistan has constructed the deal with the IMF to balance its books, burdening Pakistan with regressive taxes, unaffordable fuel, spiking electricity tariffs and unprecedented gas shortages. Affording basic needs such as food and warmth for the winter has become impossible tasks for the country, it is no wonder that families are struggling to pay for education of their children or afford basic medicine.”
She said the people were right to ask as to who was running Pakistan now.
“From the way the country has been progressing, it is clear that the IMF is running the country by proxy and the government in Islamabad has simply become the figurehead.
“According to new conditions, the State Bank will report directly to IMF headquarters now, instead of the cabinet or the parliament of the country. This re-colonisation of Pakistan is unacceptable to us. We paid a heavy price for our freedom. Yes, we ran many IMF programmes before but never in this shameful manner,” she said.
Ms Rehman said there had already been an increase of electricity tax by Rs1.68 per unit, while petroleum tax had been increased and it was now being sold at Rs145.82 per litre.
“To further exacerbate the economy, the interest rate has been increased by 150 bps and is now at a whopping 8.75pc which will directly hurt the private sector, especially SMEs,” she said.

3,PPP leader among four killed in ambush near Mastung,Cause of the killings could not be ascertained so far; hundreds of people belonging to the Ababki tribe reach Mastung hospital.,"QUETTA: A tribal elder and local leader of the Pakistan Peoples Party was killed along with three companions in an ambush near Mastung late Sunday night.
Police said Sardarzada Mohammad Khan Ababki was going to Quetta from Mastung with some companions and guards in a pick-up. When the vehicle reached the Wali Khan area on Quetta-Mastung road, armed men hiding on both sides of the road opened fire on the pick-up using automatic weapons.
As a result, Sardarzada Ababki and another person were killed on the spot and six others, including guards, were seriously injured.
Police and personnel of a security force rushed to the site and shifted the bodies and the injured to Nawab Raisani Memorial Hospital in Mastung. However, two of the injured could not survive as they had received multiple bullet injuries.
The remaining four injured were later shifted to the Trauma Centre of the Civil Hospital Quetta.
Deputy Commissioner of Mastung retired major Ilyas Karzai said that the armed men after firing at Mr Ababki’s vehicle escaped from the site. He said that security forces had launched a search operation in the area.
The cause of the killings could not be ascertained so far. However, it seems to be motivated by tribal enmity.
Hundreds of people belonging to the Ababki tribe reached the Mastung hospital after the incident.

7,OPINION: Stability with growth,"When growth is strong, the path of least resistance may be to not take any action that may appear to undermine growth.","PAKISTAN’S economic growth history is striking for its lack of stability. Repeated boom-bust cycles — rapid economic growth followed by a crash — cause uncertainty in livelihoods of our citizens and undermine the ability of our businesses to plan for the longer term. One key cause of these repeated boom-bust cycles is delayed policy action to prevent overheating. 
Friday’s decision of the State Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to raise the policy rate by 150 basis points, and moderate the pace of growth, is a step towards the goal of maintaining stability with growth. In this context, it is important to understand why the SBP moved the MPC a week earlier, the considerations behind an increase of 150 basis points, and how the central bank sees monetary policy evolving in the near term to preserve stability with growth. Before addressing these three key questions, it is important to note that with Friday’s action on the policy rate, monetary policy continues to remain supportive of growth as indicated by continued negative real interest rates. SBP expects growth of around 5 per cent for this fiscal year, a four-year high.
In the September Monetary Policy Statement, the MPC had already indicated that the highly accommodative monetary policy settings that had been maintained since the onset of Covid in March 2020 were no longer needed. This policy response helped Pakistan emerge from the Covid shock earlier and with much less economic damage than almost any country in the world. However, with growth improving continuously since last summer and fears surrounding the Delta variant receding, the MPC noted that it was appropriate to begin tapering the monetary stimulus to prevent overheating. Accordingly, the policy rate was raised in September and future moves were expected to be gradual in the absence of unforeseen circumstances.
Since then, however, things did not turn out fully the way the MPC had anticipated. In particular, inflation and the current account deficit have risen somewhat faster than expected because of both domestic and global factors. At the same time, prospects for economic growth have also strengthened further. Such variances between projections and outcomes have become more pronounced in the face of uncertainties related to an unprecedented shock like Covid. For instance, developments in international commodity prices and global inflation over the last few months have challenged central banks around the world.
When outcomes are different from projections, it is important to be forward-looking and recalibrate the best course of action given the updated information. It was in this context that the date of the MPC meeting was brought forward. In addition, learning from this experience and international best practice, the frequency of MPC meetings was also increased from six to eight times a year, enabling faster course correction in the event of any future material deviation of outcomes from forecasts.
In deciding how much to raise the policy rate, the MPC weighed several factors. Since the extent of inflation and current account developments had been moderately more than that anticipated at the time of the September MPC meeting, the pace of tapering monetary stimulus needed to be somewhat more than the gradual pace anticipated at that time. Even before the announcement that the MPC meeting was being brought forward, analysts had already priced in a hike of at least 100 basis points in the policy rate in the November meeting. After careful deliberation, the MPC came to the view that raising the policy rate by 150 basis points would strike an appropriate balance between protecting the outlook for inflation and the current account deficit while also supporting stable growth.
So where does Friday’s move leave us in terms of the future path of monetary policy? Since the MPC began providing forward guidance in January, it has been centred on two major components: (a) the end goal of mildly positive real interest rates and (b) the pace at which this goal would be achieved. The end goal remains the same. However, given the more than expected rise in inflation and current account deficits in recent months, it is appropriate that the pace of achieving it be somewhat accelerated. Friday’s rate action was a significant move in this direction. As a result, and given the currently available information, the MPC expects future moves to be smaller in magnitude, such that the path to mildly positive real interest rates is likely to be less steep from here.
When growth is strong, the path of least resistance may be to not take any action that may appear to undermine growth. After all, why not go along with the trend and avoid any action to risk unpopularity. If a bust ensues, blame can always be apportioned to external factors beyond the control of policymakers. Such a course, however, has to be avoided as it would perpetuate repeated boom-bust cycles as in our past. In this light, it is imperative to make a break from the past and gear policy to give equal weight to stability and growth; we cannot afford to let our history rob us of our future.

8,Amnesty asks Pakistan to end enforced disappearances,"Says that since war on terror start, hundreds of Pakistani rights defenders, activists, students, journalists have gone missing.","ISLAMABAD: The Amn­e­­sty International on Mon­day urged Pakistani authorities to stop forcibly disappearing suspected militants for years without trial, calling the practice abhorrent.
In a report entitled “Living Ghosts”, the rights group describes the difficulties faced by the families of the disappeared in obtaining information about their detained relatives. It says that since the beginning of the US-led war on terror, hundreds of Pakistani rights defenders, activists, students and journalists have gone missing.
Among such detainees was Idris Khattak, who disappeared while traveling in the country’s northwest in 2019. Weeks later, authorities acknowledged he was in their custody on unspecified treason charges. Khattak worked for Amnesty Inter­national and Human Rights Watch before disappearing.
Enforced disappearance is a cruel practice that has caused indelible pain to hundreds of families in Pakistan over the past two decades. On top of the untold anguish of losing a loved one and having no idea of their whereabouts or safety, families endure other long-term effects, including ill-health and financial problems, said Rehab Mahamoor, Amnesty International’s acting South Asia researcher.
She asked Pakistan to disclose the fate and whereabouts of all the disappeared to their families, and release those still being held. The group also urged officials lin­ked to such enforced disappearances to be put on trial.
There was no immediate comment from the government, which has repeatedly denied the allegations. It says most of the missing went to Afghanistan to join militant groups in recent years.
Although Pakistani law prohibits detentions without court approval, officials have privately conceded that intelligence agencies were holding an unspecified number of suspects at detention facilities.

9,PM Imran calls for expanding Pak-US cooperation to stabilise Afghanistan,Says there is an urgent need to financially assist the Afghan people as part of the effort to prevent a humanitarian crisis.,"

ISLAMABAD: The Chairman of House Foreign Affairs Committee, Congressman Gregory Meeks, and the Chairman of Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, Central Asia and Non-Proliferation, Congressman Ami Bera, call on Prime Minister Imran Khan on Monday.—AP

 
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Monday stressed the need for enhancing bilateral parliamentary and diplomatic cooperation between Pakistan and the United States to promote peace, stability and economic development in Afghanistan.
During a series of meetings with the visiting Chairman of House Foreign Affairs Committee (HFAC) Congressman Gregory Meeks and Chairman of Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, Central Asia and Non-Proliferation Congressman Ami Bera, the Pakistani side apprised the visitors of the new legislation passed by parliament on electoral reforms and rights of women, children, journalists, religious minorities and trans genders.
According to the Prime Minister Office, PM Khan warmly welcomed the two congressmen’s visit to Pakistan and expressed the hope that the visit would not only lead to further deepening of Pakistan-US relations but would also be instrumental in strengthening relations between parliaments of the two countries.

 



 
He expressed the hope that more high-level exchanges would take place between the two countries to reinforce their ties.

US Congress delegation also meets foreign minister, army chief

Mr Khan said there was an urgent need to financially assist the Afghan people as part of the effort to prevent a humanitarian crisis and economic collapse in Afghanistan.
He hoped that ways and means would be found to address the liquidity issue to enable banking channels to help Afghanistan sustain its immediate economic burden and challenges.
The two sides agreed that Pakistan and the United States should work to strengthen bilateral trade and economic relationship and cooperate with each other in health, security, counterterrorism and climate change issues.
In a separate meeting with the congressional delegation, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said Pakistan valued its relationship with the US and wanted to further deepen and widen this relationship.
He expressed the hope that more high-level exchanges would take place between the two countries.
The foreign minister emphasised that Pakistan was pursuing imperatives of geo-economics and it was determined to make the country a hub of trade, investment and finance.
He invited US companies to invest in Pakistan’s IT and health sectors.
The two congressmen said that given Pakistan’s potential and the size of its 220 million-plus consumer market, the US companies were keen to invest in Pakistan. It was noted that both countries were making impressive strides in deepening co-operation in climate change and fighting the Covid-19 pandemic.
Mr Qureshi underlined Pakistan’s commitment to peace, stability and progress in Afghanistan and highlighted the country’s continuing efforts for facilitating humanitarian assistance and economic support to Afghanistan given the twin challenges being faced by the Afghan people.
He expressed the hope that the international community would expeditiously extend finical assistance to Afghanistan to enable the country to meet its compelling needs.
Congressman Meeks deeply appreciated Pakistan’s role in the evacuation of US and Afghan nationals as well as Special Immigrant Visa Holders (SIVs) from Afghanistan and hoped that the two countries would expand their engagement to stabilise Afghanistan.
The foreign minister said that Pakistan was firmly committed to promoting peace and security in South Asia to enable the region to realise its immense potential and expressed the hope that the US would support Pakistan’s endeavours in this regard.
The delegation also met National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaisar who apprised the delegation of the recently enacted election reform laws to ensure transparency in the electoral process in Pakistan. He said parliament had legislated on protection of rights of women, children, religious monitories and trans genders.
The speaker said the media was an important part of governance and, therefore, protection of media persons’ rights was imperative so that they could perform their duties without fear or foe.
He said the government owed to the Pakistani diaspora who had made immense contribution towards their motherland. “The recent grant of right to vote to overseas Pakistanis is realisation of the commitment the present government made to them,” he said.
In reply to a question by the congressmen, the speaker said the government had legislated to ensure international transparency, and empowered the State Bank of Pakistan in decision making, besides incentivising the economic and manufacturing sectors to achieve their potential.
The US congressmen thanked the NA speaker for providing them the opportunity for exchange of views. Mr Gregory Meeks agreed that parliamentary engagement would strengthen the existing bilateral relations.
He appreciated the Pakistani leadership for handling the economic crisis during Covid-19. He also termed contributions of Pakistan to climate change and renewable energies, immense. He said that Pakistan was playing a vital role in mitigating the effects of global warming.
Congressman Ami Bera also termed relations between the US and Pakistan based on trust and cooperation. He appreciated contributions of Pakistani women lawmakers to the law making.
The delegation also called on Chief of the Army Staff Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa and discussed issues of mutual interest, current security situation in Afghanistan and bilateral cooperation in various fields.
According to a military spokesperson, the COAS said that Pakistan desired to maintain the tradition of bilateral engagement with all regional players and wished for enduring peace in the region.
Gen Bajwa reiterated the need for global convergence on Afghanistan for avoiding a humanitarian crisis and coordinated efforts for economic uplift of the Afghan people. He re-emphasised that “peace in Afghanistan means peace in Pakistan”.
