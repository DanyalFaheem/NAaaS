0,Khayaban-i-Iqbal to have two interchanges to cope with increasing traffic,"CDA board set to approve hiring of consultant to build interchanges at E-11 Chowk, Shaheen Chowk","ISLAMABAD: To cope with the ongoing as well as further traffic burden on Khayaban-i-Iqbal after completion of the portion of Margalla Road, the civic agency has decided to construct two interchanges on it.
The Capital Development Authority (CDA)’s engineering wing will build the two interchanges at E-11 Chowk and Shaheen Chowk as the CDA board is going to take up the approval of the consultant firm for these interchanges in its meeting to be held on Thursday.
Khayaban-i-Iqbal, which is falsely known as Margalla Road, is one of the busiest roads in Islamabad. Due to educational institutions and government offices it faces traffic congestion on a daily basis near Shaheen Chowk.
In E-11, which has become a new business hub particularly after the construction of wedding marquees and apartment buildings, the road also faces huge traffic burden.

CDA board set to approve hiring of consultant to build interchanges at E-11 Chowk, Shaheen Chowk

CDA officials said when a portion of the (original) Margalla Road from G.T. Road to Sangjani would be completed this road would be facing more traffic. 
Therefore, construction of the interchanges is imperative to handle the rush to some extent.
The officials said work on Margalla Road was in progress and would hopefully be completed in the current fiscal year and would be linked with Khyaban-i-Iqbal from Sangjani.
They said PC-I of both the projects had already been approved by CDA’s Development Working Party in June and after hiring of the consultant the civic agency would call tenders for starting work on the interchanges.
Prime Minister Imran Khan in April this year performed the groundbreaking of the Margalla Avenue project. The prime minister had said with the construction of the road traffic burden on Murree Road near Bhara Kahu would reduce as it would serve as a bypass at Bhara Kahu.
The construction work was awarded to the Frontier Works Organisation (FWO). The CDA divided the project into three phases. 
In the first phase, a portion of the road will be constructed from G.T. Road to Sangjani and in the second the Bhara Kahu bypass would be built and in future the third phase from Sangjani to Constitution Avenue will be taken up.
Currently, work is in progress in the first portion. 
However, construction is yet to be started in the second phase – the Bhara Kahu bypass – as currently detailed engineering and survey is being conducted on the project.
This phase will provide a big relief to the people of the capital city, Bhara Kahu, Murree, Abbottabad and Azad Jammu and Kashmir. 
Every year in the summer season, millions of tourists face massive traffic congestion at Bhara Kahu.
“Focusing on the road from G.T. Road to Sangjani is good but we will appeal to the CDA to also look into the second phase to ensure its early start as this phase is linked to millions of people who suffer traffic jams at Bhara Kahu,” said Faisal Khan, a resident of Bhara Kahu.

1,Police still have not disclosed details of newborn’s kidnappers,"RAWALPINDI: Despite passage of three weeks, police have been unable to disclose details about the kidnappers ...","RAWALPINDI: Despite passage of three weeks, police have been unable to disclose details about the kidnappers involved in the abduction of a newborn baby from the guarded nursery of Holy Family Hospital (HFH).
When contacted, the baby’s father said: “My father asked the police to show him the kidnapper who had abducted his grandson and they said that they would deal with him themselves.”
He said the involvement of the hospital staff cannot be ruled out due to which police as well as the hospital management was silent.
City Police Officer (CPO) Athar Ismail told Dawn that the police team led by Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) New Town had been working hard on the case from different angles – keeping in view past incidents.
The CPO said: “It might be a solitary act or it could be a gang involved. This is yet to be ascertained. Although it appears that the staff may be involved, our focus is not primarily on this.” He added that the hospital’s security has been sensitised after the kidnapping incident happened.
When the medical superintendent (MS) of the hospital was asked about the police investigation, she said she had been told by the police to let them complete their investigation and the details would be disclosed soon.
After the baby was taken and police investigation launched, a cell was established in the hospital to facilitate police who were inquiring about all the staff members on duty at the time of the incident.
On the other hand, a five-member team constituted by the MS is likely to submit a report to her by the end of the week.
The baby was found lying in a private hospital in Dhoke Syedan, four days after being abducted on Nov 4, 2021 with a letter which stated that this was the baby stolen from the nursery of HFH.
The baby dropped by an unidentified woman in the private hospital was wrapped in the same blanket which was covering a doll lying in place of the newborn in the HFH nursery on Sunday Oct 31, 2021.
After the private hospital management found the abandoned baby with a letter, they informed the police which led to the baby’s recovery.
“A woman walked into the private hospital, and left the scene after placing the baby wrapped in a blanket with a letter which said he was the newborn stolen from the HFH,” a source said.
“We are enjoying life with our loved one since he was found and brought home,” the baby’s father said, adding that, “we have named him Mohammad Irtaza and every member is enjoying days and nights playing with him.”

On Saturday, a gang of robbers entered the house PML-N Senator Nuzhat Sadiq at F-10/1 and took away cash and valuables worth Rs4.7 million.
After the incident, Inspector General of Police Qazi Jamilur Rehman and Deputy Inspector General of Police Afzal Ahmed Kausar visited the Shalimar police station, cheeked the record and suspended the SHO, said the police.
The IGP also removed the SDPO and directed him to report to the Central Police Office.
Senior police officials said a zonal in-charge was also served with a displeasure letter over different issues, including holding an open kutchery on a premise owned by a land grabber. 
The officials said the practice of appointing junior officers on senior posts was one of the reasons behind the increase in crime. 
Sub-inspectors are appointed as SHOs despite the availability of 53 inspectors in the capital. Likewise, grade-18 officers (SPs) are also appointed on the post of grade-19 (SSPs), they added.
When contacted for comments, IGP Qazi Jamilur Rehman said Additional Superintendent of Police Farhat Abbas Kazmi would respond on his behalf. 
Mr Kazmi said there were some issues, including a robbery at the house of the senator, which resulted in the removal of the SHO Shalimar and the SDPO of the circle.
It is also a prerogative of the IGP to appoint officers on any posts, he said, adding there was a policy to appoint competent and capable officers as SHOs and SSPs.
Junior ranking officers work hard on senior posts and show good performance compared to officers of senior ranks, Mr Kazmi said.
About the zonal in-charge, he said displeasure was already issued to him. Recently, five open kutcheries were conducted by him, including one at a house of a man, he added.

3,Private school owner in Islamabad allotted 11 kanals in H-8 at ‘reduced’ rate,"In May, CDA decided to charge school owner over Rs475 million but later reduced the cost to Rs237.5m.","ISLAMABAD: The estate wing of the Capital Development Authority (CDA) has allotted a plot to the owner of a private school measuring 11 kanals in H-8 after revising the earlier calculated rate and reducing the amount to an astonishing Rs237.5 million.
Through its ratified move, the CDA allotted the land on the rate reserved for amenity plots.
Sources said a plot, which was allotted to the school in 2007-8 in F-11, was cancelled later as besides other issues the residents of F-11 were opposing the earmarking of it in the area. Later, on the direction of court, the CDA heard the case again, restored the plot and shifted it to H-8, which is exclusively reserved for educational institutions.
However, the CDA decided to charge Rs84,716 per square yard which means that the allottee of the plot has to deposit Rs470 million in the CDA kitty to get the allotment letter.

In May, CDA decided to charge owner over 475m but later reduced the cost to Rs237.5m

A document available with Dawn states: “The rate of the premium worked out to Rs475,629,510/. The rate per sq yard, of the premium is subject to change and may be imposed accordingly from time to time”.
It added: “If the above offer is acceptable, please arrange payment of premium of land amounting to Rs475,629,510 along with AGR @ Rs6 worked out to Rs33,687 within four months from date of issuance of this letter so that this office may proceed further in the matter”.
It also stated: “In compliance with the judgment/decision dated 30-9-2016 of the Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in Civil Petition ... of 2014 and Civil Review Petition of 2015, your request has been considered/examined by Member (P&D), CDA and acceded to and Authority has decided to offer plot no. 101 measuring 5614.40 square yard in Sector H-8, Islamabad”.
Sources said the rate was fixed, which was reflected on the offer letter issued in May 2021 in accordance with the one fixed for institutions. 
However, the estate wing issued a revised offer letter with a rate reduced from Rs84,716 to Rs42,358, (decreasing the total cost from Rs470 million to around Rs238 million). 
This offer was accepted after which the final allotment was issued.
CDA Member Estate Naveed Illahi while speaking to Dawn defended the allotment. He said the estate wing on the recommendation of the finance wing got the rate revised as the earlier rate was not meant for school plots.
Director (Estate Management) Anwar Khan, who issued the final allotment letter, also defended the allotment and said the plot was allotted on the basis of the rate calculated by costing section of the finance wing in accordance with rules and regulations. He said it was an old case as the school was first allotted a plot in 2008 and charged as per the rate fixed for schools.
It is relevant to note here that in the past the CDA allotted plots to private schools on throwaway rates. 
In 2007, a policy was introduced for private schools and allotment of plots under this policy was widely criticised and resulted into cancellation of 17 out of the total 19 plots allotted to private school owners. 
The said plot was also among the 19 plots initially allotted in 2007-8.
CDA officials said in the past a 6,000 square yard plot was allotted at Rs70 per square yard in F-7/2 in 1981 to the owners of Froebels International School.
The owners of Beaconhouse School System were allotted a 23,725 square yard plot at Rs100 square yard in H-8/1 in 1985 and owners of The City School were allotted a 14,036 square yard plot at Rs100 per square yard in H-8 in 1986.
Similarly, owners of National College of Business and Management Sciences and Wahid Public School were allotted 8,888 square yard and 14,605 square yard plots, respectively, at Rs250 square yard.
For International Grammar School and College, Toddlers Academy, Ambrose Hall School, Cambridge School and Islamabad School of Art and Sciences various amounts of land was allotted at Rs500 per square yard.
Owners of Magic Roundabout Nurseries were allotted 1.8 acres at Rs843 per square yard in Farash Town in 2006 whereas owners of Siddeeq Public School and Sajid Ideal Model High School were allotted three acres each at Rs1,785 per square yard in 2006.
The owner of Pak Turk International School was allotted two plots in 2006; one measuring 2.66 acres at Rs1,785 per square yard in Chak Shahzad and the other measuring 12,100 square yard at Rs7,400 per square yard in sector H-8
The owners of Bahria College Naval Complex, Bahria Foundation College, Headstart School, Roots Montessori School and Modern Institute of Informatics and Management were allotted various amounts of land at Rs4,500 per square yard in the past.

The initiative titled Pakistan Innovation Challenge will provide children an opportunity to participate in online competitions. The decision to launch the initiative was taken jointly by the Ministry of Information Technology and the visiting delegation of Digital Cooperation Organisation (DCO) to promote public-private partnership, enhance the role of women in IT, provide digital facilities in urban and rural areas and promote self employment among skilled youth.
Minister of IT and Telecommunication Syed Aminul Haq talking to Dawn said that the students will participate in competitions related to designing and creating 3D stories, developing games, and other innovations.
The Pakistan Innovation Challenge will be executed with support of the DCO by the IT ministry, Special Technology Zones Authority and technology companies PolyUp and Innovators Garage.
The DCO, established in 2020, consists of seven founding member countries including Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Nigeria, Oman and Jordan.
The idea of establishing the DCO was floated by the government of Saudi Arabia to enable market opportunities for people of member countries. The first secretary general of DCO is Deema Al-Yahya, an IT professional belonging to Saudi Arabia, who is currently visiting the member states.
In the last leg of the tour before proceeding to Nigeria, she noted that progress made by Pakistan in the sector highlighted importance of the Pakistan-DCO partnership to enable digital prosperity for all.
The statement issued by the DCO secretariat states that Ms Yahya has lauded the inclusion of young people, women and entrepreneurs in Pakistan’s digital economy.
“The DCO is committed to enabling Pakistan’s progress in these areas,” she added, “We look forward to supporting Pakistan as a valued member state of the DCO for years to come.”
Pakistan has informed the DCO delegation of innovative solutions to provide IT and telecom services to rural areas without public sector investment.
“The Universal Service Fund (USF) and other ideas of Ministry of IT were presented to the DCO that can be replicated in other countries,” the IT minister said.
USF is financed by telecom companies operating in the country and this fund is utilised for establishing telecom infrastructure in rural and remote areas where companies do not enter as business volumes are not attractive.
Mr Haq said member countries could benefit from the expertise of start-ups in Pakistan by investing in them while joint efforts were also required for free movement of IT professionals and companies in member countries.
“The Pakistan government is committed to providing all our citizens with the skills to benefit from our vision of a knowledge-based digital economy. The Pakistan Innovation Challenge is a great example of how we are partnering globally to support our children and Pakistan’s future,” the minister added.

A division bench, comprising Chief Justice Athar Minallah and Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, heard identical petitions filed against the August 2021 balloting in which FGEHA had allotted 4,723 plots to top judges, including incumbent Chief Justice of Pakistan Gulzar Ahmed, senior pusine judge Umar Atta Bandial and 50 other judges of the superior courts, senior bureaucrats and others.
IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah on September 13 suspended the allotment while hearing the petitions and an appeal against the single-member bench decision that had directed FGEHA to consider the left-over applicants for G-13 and G-14 who had applied for plots for over a decade ago.
Interestingly, the FGEHA executive board also made allotment to all of its members.
The board comprises secretary housing and works Dr Imran Zeb Khan, FGEHA director general Tariq Rasheed, additional secretary Zahoor Ahmed, draftsman of the law ministry Mohammad Israr, senior chief Planning Commission Mohammad Anwar, senior joint secretary finance division Rizwan Ahmed Sheikh, Chief Commissioner Islamabad Amir Ali Ahmed, chief executive of Pakistan Housing Authority Foundation Amir Mohyuddin, FGEHA chief engineer retired Capt Imtiazul Haq Khattak, chief planner Dr Asghar Naeem and joint secretary ministry of housing Mohammad Buksh Sangi.
During an earlier hearing, the secretary housing sought adjournment to formulate a policy for allotment of plots.
Justice Minallah pointed out that the FGEHA DG had filed an appeal before the Supreme Court and asked the latter whether he felt aggrieved from any interim order of the IHC?
The secretary housing informed the court that the federal government had formulated a policy for allotment of plots.
He also revealed that journalists, lawyers and all categories other than civil servants had been excluded from the government housing schemes.
However, when Justice Minallah inquired as to whether the judges would be entitled to get plots in government schemes, the secretary housing replied that the chief justices of the superior courts may send nominations through respective registrars.
Justice Minallah remarked that the policy should not be confined to officers only as it was the right of the low grade employees to get a plot at subsidised rates.
On the court’s query, the secretary housing said FGEHA was developing F-14, F-15, a housing scheme at Park Road and the new sectors of G-12 and F-12.
The court noted that the FGEHA members got subsidised plots and then disposed them of at exorbitant rates in the open market which was an injustice.
The authority could have earned Rs3 billion from auction of plots in each sector and the amount could be utilised for establishing new hospitals, controlling inflation etc.
Justice Minallah pointed out that by including judges in the housing schemes, FGEHA developed the interest of superior courts judges and when they will take up cases related to the authority it would be tantamount to clash of interests.
FGEHA’s lawyer Mohammad Akram Sheikh explained the salient features of the policy.
He argued that when the statute provides an internal mechanism for redressing grievances, approaching those authorities was mandatory and it did not fall within the ambit of conflict of interest.
He submitted to the court that the forum of the IHC was being used in these proceedings to scandalise the judges of superior judiciary.

Speaking at a function at Pir Mehr Ali Shah Arid Agriculture University to mark the silver jubilee of the university, the minister said universities and students could change the destiny of the country.
He said social media platforms were founded by young people who revolutionised the information technology sector. He said Stanford University in the United States had built a $3 trillion economy.
The minister said when Pakistan was established there was only one university but now the number of universities in the country is over 200.
He requested vice chancellors of universities to set targets for their contribution in national development to motivate the students.
He said when the first case of Covid-19 was detected in Pakistan on Feb 26, 2020, the country was not preparing anything related to coronavirus.
He said at that time Pakistan was importing safety kits, masks, ventilators and had a shortage of sanitisers.
He said he worked for lifting the ban on the use of ethanol for manufacturing sanitisers and within a short span of seven months Pakistan started exporting coronavirus-related material.
He said agricultural universities in Multan, Faisalabad, Tando Adam, Lasbela and Rawalpindi had been giving marvelous performance.
It is very important that the government should have close contact with universities, he said, adding students and universities should also develop close contact with private entrepreneurs and the business community.
He said it was a good omen that there was a large number of students in agricultural universities who would take part in the economic development of Pakistan.
He said Pakistan could be a major source of agricultural exports due to its proximity to countries importing agricultural products.
He said there was a lot of potential in modern agriculture and focus should be shifted to smart forms instead of conventional farming.
He urged the students to form their own companies which could help farmers in setting up smart farms, including livestock farms.

The bill has defined “youth” as a person “who has attained the age of 25 years and not exceeded the age of 35 years at the time of filing of nomination paper”.
According to the 1973 Constitution, the minimum age of a candidate for contesting the elections on a National Assembly seat is 25 years.
The bill has suggested insertion of a new sub-section in Section 206 which says: “A political party, while making the selection of candidates on general seats, shall ensure at least thirty (30) per cent representations of youth candidates, especially those from under represented sections of the society.”
Another new sub-clause states that “a political party shall provide campaign finance support to its youth candidates.”
Similarly, a new sub-clause in Section 208 says: “a political party shall ensure at least 30 per cent youth representation in its central office-bearers and executive committee members, by whatever name called.”
The Statement of Objects and Reasons attached to the bills says that “around 64 per cent Pakistan’s population is consisted of people under the age of 30 years. This is a historic and very unique demographic opportunity for the country but unless young people are most directly involved in creating legislation which impacts them and their constituencies, Pakistan cannot benefit from the enormous potential and innovative edge of its youth bulge.”
This amendment bill, it says, seeks to increase youth electoral and political representation in Pakistan.
“It will democratise and ensure youth representation in the decision-making of the country by also mandating preferential representation of working class and under-represented groups of society in the elected and political leadership,” the bill says.
