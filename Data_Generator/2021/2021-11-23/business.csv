0,ECC scraps two wheat import tenders,Official says decision taken because of sufficient local availability of wheat as well as higher prices on international market.,"ISLAMABAD: The Economic Coordination Com­mi­t­tee (ECC) of the Cabinet on Monday scrapped two international tenders for the import of wheat over higher prices and allowed the floating of a fresh one.
The ECC meeting presided over by Economic Affairs Minister Omar Ayub Khan cancelled the wheat tenders on the recommendation of the Ministry of Food Security and Research.
The seventh and eighth international wheat tenders for the current fiscal year for importing 90,000 tonnes each were opened on Oct 25 and Nov 4, respectively.
An official in the Ministry of Food Security said the tenders were scrapped because of sufficient local availability of wheat as well as higher prices on the international market.
An official announcement of the Finance Division said that the ECC scrapped the seventh tender floated by the Trading Corporation of Pakistan and allowed the state-run grain importer to issue fresh tender. Similarly, the eighth wheat tender was also cancelled on the basis of higher prices.
The ECC further directed the food security ministry to re-assess the need and requirements of neighbouring country Afghanistan for wheat.
The ECC approved a summary seeking elimination/reduction of tariffs on various items currently being imported from Afghanistan as goodwill gesture.
The sub-committee on revision of OMCs and dealers margins sought time for deciding revision in margin on petroleum products. It was decided that the summary may be tabled in the next meeting after soliciting comments and views from all the members of the committee.
On the summary of Ministry of National Health Services, the ECC exempted personal & protective and testing laboratory equipment donated by the USAID-funded programme — Promoting Quality of Medicine Plus — from customs duty and taxes.
The ECC also recommended the allocation of Rs6 billion to initiate the process for improvement and rehabilitation programme of Balkassar-Mianwali (N-130) and Mianwali-Muzaffargarh (N-135) roads. The ECC also deliberated in detail and recommended funds for payment of salaries to the employees of Heavy Electrical Complex (HEC) and markup to Bank of Khyber with directions to finalise the privatisation of HEC by mid-January next year.

2,"SC suspends IHC order axing probe against cooking oil, ghee firms",The inquiry was initiated under Competition Act of 2010 against a number of manufacturers in view of the hike in their prices.,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Monday suspended the Islamabad High Court’s September 14 order quashing an inquiry initiated by the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) into the spike in prices of cooking oil and ghee in 2020.
A three-judge SC bench, headed by Justice Umar Ata Bandial, suspended the IHC order after granting leave to appeal moved by the CCP and its inquiry officers through senior counsel Faisal Siddiqui against Dalda Foods (Pvt) Ltd, seeking to set aside the high court’s decision.
The inquiry was initiated under the Competition Act of 2010 against a number of manufactures of ghee and cooking oil in view of the hike in their prices. Subsequently, Dalda Foods Ltd had challenged it in the IHC which set aside different letters and orders issued by the CCP for information as well as the inquiry initiated against the cooking oil manufacturer.
The CCP appeal argued that the commission was a watchdog body established under Section 12 of the Competition Act with the purpose of ensuring free competition in all spheres of commercial and economic activity and protecting the consumers from anti-competitive behaviour.
On a complaint on the Prime Minister Citizen’s Complaint Portal, the National Price Monitoring Committee (NPMC) held a meeting on May 20 last year to deliberate on the prices of essential items and their supply position and suggested to the CCP to check anti-competitive practices by taking into consideration the international commodity prices.
Moreover, the Ministry of Industries and Productions had also brought to the notice of the CCP complaints against non-reduction in prices of ghee and cooking oil through a letter on June 8, 2020 as well as the complaint on the citizen’s portal on the issue, stating that the commission had the mandate to intervene in such situations and initiate suo motu action under Section 37 of the Competition Act.
Subsequently, the CCP through July 13, 2020 letters sought information from different manufacturers, including Dalda Foods, about the alleged excessive pricing of Vanaspati ghee in the market.
The appeal stated that Dalda Foods through a July 21 reply did not cooperate and sought to delay the issue though other entities like the All Pakistan Solvent Extractors’ Association, Pakistan Vanaspati Manufacturers’ Association, Rawat Oil and Ghee Mills (Pvt) Ltd, Pardhan Oil Industries (Pvt) Limited, Bilour Industries (Pvt) Limited, Chashma Ghee Mills (Pvt) Limited, Golden Oil Products, Mujahid Oil Refinery Limited, Platinum Argo, Taj Vegetable Oil Processing Unit (Pvt) Limited, Hafeez Iqbal Oil and Ghee Industries (Pvt) Limited, Associated Industries Limited, Punjab Oil Mills Limited, Fahad Hammad Oil and Ghee Industries and Khadija Edible Oil Refinery (Pvt) Limited had provided the requisite information.
The appeal explained that after the collection of certain basic data in the context of alleged violations of the Competition Act, a preliminary/tentative opinion was formed by the CCP and the inquiry was initiated on its own under Section 37(1) into the price hike in relation to alleged violations of Sections 3 and 4 of the Act. Thus the inquiry was neither arbitrary nor non-transparent but was strictly in accordance with Section 37(1) of the Competition Act, it contended.
Dalda Foods had approached the high court which, according to the appeal, stayed the inquiry on November 18, 2020. The IHC later allowed the petition by highlighting what were the prerequisites for exercise of authority by the CCP to order an inquiry under Section 37 of the Competition Act and whether a division of the federal government or the NPMC had the authority under the Competition Act to direct the CCP to initiate regulatory action on the basis that in its opinion a fall in international prices of a commodity had not translated into reduction in domestic prices of such a commodity.
The CCP appeal argued that the high court had wrongly held that the inquiry was only concerned with a mere price increase without any application of the mind as to how such a price hike was linked with violation of Sections 3 and 4 of the Competition Act. The court had further erroneously held that based on the American jurisprudence, no such inquiry can be initiated without the presence of ‘plus factors’ i.e. price fixing conspiracy, defendant acting contrary to his own interests and evidence implying a traditional conspiracy, the appeal contended.

4,Action ordered against urea hoarders,"Meeting briefed that farmers are getting one urea bag between Rs1,950 and Rs2,000 whereas rates should be around Rs1,850.","ISLAMABAD: The Fertiliser Re­­v­iew Committee (FRC) on Monday directed the provinces to take strict actions against urea hoarders. The directives came amid a looming fertiliser shortage across the country.
The FRC meeting, chaired by Federal Minister for Industries and Production Makhdum Khusro Bakh­tyar, sought to allay issues related to supply of crop nutrients. The meeting noted that urea prices were already beginning to increase at the retail end, with buyers paying up an additional Rs120 for a 20kg bag.
The FRC meeting was attended by Minister for Energy Hammad Azhar and Minister for National Food Security & Research Syed Fakhar Imam along with relevant officials and representatives of fertiliser manufacturers.
The meeting was briefed that farmers were getting one urea bag between Rs1,950 and Rs2,000 in different parts of the country whereas the rates should be around Rs1,850.
Fertiliser manufacturers present in the meeting said the ex-factory price was Rs1,798 per bag and other overheads including freight charges, dealers’ margins etc which had not changed significantly.
Regarding the urea supply and demand position in the country, meeting was informed that the data of National Fertiliser Development Company (NFDC) showed an increase in urea sales by 10 per cent during January-October. Fertiliser offtake in 10 months of 2021 was 5.081 million tonnes against 4.626m tonnes during same period last year.
The officials said demand for urea has increased due to the favourable agriculture policies of the government and better farm economics.
The officials presented a report highlighting that different dealers had hoarded around 450,000 tonnes of urea and were gaining exorbitant profits over it.
Mr Bakhtyar expressed concern over the hoarding of an essential commodity for farmers and asked the provincial governments to take strict action against hoarders and those engaged in black marketing of fertilisers.
Meanwhile, fertiliser manufacturers said that there had to be a difference between storage and hoarding as warehousing was part of the supply chain.
The meeting was informed that traditionally the highest fertiliser offtake was witnessed in December which is up to 800,000 tonnes. However, this year it was expected to be between 800,000 and one million tonnes.
The fertiliser manufacturers highlighted that the shortage was not due to supply constraints but due to high demand. The manufacturers asked the three ministers present there to consider various proposals forwarded to the Ministry of Industries and the Ministry of National Food Security & Research for improving the supply side.

5,SBP urged to fix policy rate at 7pc,KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan’s move to increase discount rate by 150 basis points to 8.75 per cent will...,"KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan’s move to increase discount rate by 150 basis points to 8.75 per cent will multiply the woes of the auto parts manufacturers, the Pakistan Asso­ciation of Automotive Par­ts & Accessories Manufac­turers (Paapam) said on Monday.
Paapam Chairman Abdur Razzaq Gauhar urged the SBP to bring down the interest rate to 7pc to encourage industrial expansion and growth which would bring in fresh investments and create jobs for millions of young people entering the job market every year.
The Paapam chief said the interest rate hike would lead to a crisis of unforeseen proportions for the industrial sector in general and the auto parts sector in particular.
“The auto parts manufacturers are currently struggling to survive under the impacts of rising cost of raw materials and freight, rupee fall against the dollar, higher minimum wages and expensive energy,” he added.

6,Tax breaks kick Pakistan’s electric car shift into higher gear,40pc of polluting emissions in Punjab come from transport,"ISLAMABAD: Nawabzada Kalam Ullah Khan, a businessman, had been planning to swap his family’s petrol-powered cars for electric models for years.
But it wasn’t until a set of massive tax cuts came into effect in July that the 29-year-old from Pakistan’s capital Islamabad finally put in an order for two electric cars.
“Someone has to take the initiative to switch to these cost-efficient, environment-friendly vehicles in the face of increasing pollution in big cities – and we’ve done it,” Khan said.
His new cars, he said now cost about five times less to run day to day than his old vehicles, a major incentive to make the switch.

40pc of polluting emissions in Punjab come from transport

Major Pakistan and Indian cities are struggling with dangerous levels of air pollution, with Pakistan’s Lahore this week declared the most polluted city in the world.
Heavy use of fossil-fuel-powered vehicles for transport combined with smoke from seasonal crop burning make the problem particularly severe at this time of year.
But Pakistan’s electric vehicle push is picking up speed, nearly two years after the country launched its ambitious green policy, which envisions a shift to 30 per cent electric cars and trucks nationwide by 2030, and 90pc by 2040.
Key to the shift are hefty tax exemptions for both electric vehicles imports and imports of parts and equipment to build the cars in Pakistan.
That has helped make the vehicles more affordable, industry figures said, as Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government pushes ahead with its plan to cut carbon emissions and urban pollution.
Falling taxes
The general sales tax on locally manufactured electric cars — those with batteries holding less than 50-kilowatt hours (kWh) of power — has dropped from 17pc to nearly zero, said Asim Ayaz, general manager of the government’s Engineering Development Board (EDB).
At the same time, the customs duty on imported electric car parts — such as batteries, controllers and inverters — is down to 1pc.
The duty on importing fully built electric cars also has fallen from 25pc to 10pc for one year, Ayaz told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Officials say the tax relief is a big step toward implementing Pakistan’s National Electric Vehicle Policy, originally passed by the cabinet in November 2019.
It aims to put half a million electric motorcycles and rickshaws and 100,000 electric cars, vans and small trucks into the transportation system by 2025.
“Definitely the tax exemptions make the price point (on electric vehicles) competitive,” said Malik Amin Aslam, the special assistant to the prime minister on climate change.
“It makes it extremely attractive for the customer to go electric.” Aslam said if about a third of new cars sold run on electricity by 2030, as envisioned, Pakistan could see a big drop in climate-changing emissions and pollution.
Electric vehicles currently produce 65pc fewer planet-warming gases than those running on fossil fuels, he said.
Pakistan ranks second, behind Bangladesh, according to a list of nations with the worst air quality compiled last year by IQAir, a Swiss group that measures levels of lung-damaging airborne particles known as PM2.5.
In Punjab, Pakistan’s most populous province with Lahore as its capital, transport accounts for more than 40pc of total air-polluting emissions, followed by industry and agriculture, according to a 2019 study by the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organisation.
Overcoming doubts
Shaukat Qureshi, general secretary of the Pakistan Electric Vehicles and Parts Manufac­turers and Traders Association, said the new tax cuts mean savings of up to 500,000 rupees ($2,900) on imported small electric vehicles.
He said many members of the association have used the incentives to order them for the first time.
There are no reliable figures on how many electric cars local importers have ordered brought into the country since the government announced the exemptions.
But in his other role as chief operating officer of car company Zia Electromotive, which imports and manufactures electric vehicles, Qureshi said he has ordered 100 small electric cars from China and plans to import 100 more every month after that.
Pakistanis — like many other people around the world — have historically been reluctant to switch to electric vehicles for reasons ranging from higher costs to lack of charging infrastructure and “fear of the unknown”, said Ayaz at the EDB.
The tax cuts help remove the cost obstacle, he said — and could help create about 20,000 new jobs in the auto industry as Pakistani car companies start manufacturing electric cars, he predicted.
The charging infrastructure issue remains, though some companies have already established charging stations in big cities and along motorways.
Climate change and development expert Ali Tauqeer Sheikh said the government should encourage the private sector to install more charging stations near offices, homes and parking lots.
To overcome worries that electric vehicles may have no resale value, car manufacturers and dealers could offer buy-back guarantees, he added.
But, Sheikh said, simply selling more electric cars is not enough to tackle Pakistan’s emissions and air pollution, since the total number of vehicles being sold — mainly traditional cars — is still growing every year.
He said the government needs to push to completely phase out fuel-run and hybrid vehicles by increasing taxes on them and provide affordable bank loans for people looking to buy electric.
“Poor people who use motorbikes and rickshaws deserve to have more electric vehicles on the roads to cut air pollution,” he said.
