This was stated by Layyah Deputy Commissioner Azfar Zia while addressing the inauguration ceremony of the model village. He said that under the Chief Minister District Development Programme, multiple schemes of roads, electricity, community hospital and other facilities would be launched in the village.   
“Gishkori Nashaib, which is encircled by a river offshore, named Khaddi, would also get a bridge as the district management has forwarded a special request to the Punjab Planning and Development Department for it.”   
Mr Zia said thousands of people travelled over one hundred kilometre daily to reach the other side of the river, which cost them money. 
“Around Rs160m have been pledged for the uplift of this village to be named as model town and more than 10,000 poor people of the village would get health and clean potable water facility at their doorstep,” the DC added.

Protesters occupied New Shakargarh Road and demanded VC Prof Dr Tariq Mahmood resolve their fee and academic issues. Students boycotted classes and chanted slogans against the university administration.
Protesters Farhan Aleem and Sikandar Ali said a tug of war had been ongoing between the VC and teachers but the end-sufferers were the students.
They said the university was not being run efficiently. They said the VC should either regularise or terminate teachers’ contracts but the matter should be settled at the earliest. They said their complaints to the VC about missing classes and overcharging of fees never bore any fruit. They said they returned home every day without gaining anything in terms of knowledge and learning.
VC Prof Mahmood said the selection board was conducting its own process for the appointment of assistant professors. Lecturers and associate lecturers have nothing to do with it. He alleged 10 lecturers were spreading unrest in the university. He said contract teachers did not have any academic qualifications for the job of assistant professors. He said such elements were trying to use students to blackmail him.  
He said allegations of misconduct against him were baseless. He said the recruitment process would be completed in a couple of months.

4,Prosecution failed in Czech model drug smuggling case: LHC,A detailed verdict issued by the LHC says the lacunas in the prosecution case cannot be ignored.,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has observed that the prosecution failed to prove the guilt against Czech Republic fashion model Tereza Hluskova in the drug smuggling case.
A detailed verdict issued by a two-judge bench on the appeal of the foreign model against her conviction says the lacunas in the prosecution case cannot be ignored.
Through a short order, the bench comprising Justice Ali Baqar Najafi and Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar had on Nov 1 allowed the appeal of the model acquitting her in the case.
A trial court had on March 20, 2019, sentenced the foreign model to eight years and eight months in jail for making an attempt to smuggle heroin from Lahore airport to Abu Dhabi in 2018. The trial court had also imposed a fine of Rs113,000 on the model.
As per the prosecution, the 21-year-old Czech model was trying to smuggle 8.5kg heroin from Lahore airport to Abu Dhabi on Jan 10, 2018, but was intercepted by customs officials. The prosecution presented nine witnesses against the suspects.
The verdict authored by Justice Najafi notes that the complainant and the prosecution witness, customs inspector Pervez Ahmad Qazim, has not been able to show any official document on the basis of which he was permitted to perform his duties at the airport.
The judge observes that the inspector admitted that the distance between the Custom House and the airport is 15km, then how he took almost 12 hours to reach.
He says the complainant claims that the shift in-charge at the airport retained cutter, manicure and monitor and also field test tube kit but he has not stated a word regarding handing over the said articles by the previous shift in-charge to him.
Also read: Lahore court sentences Czech model to 8 years, 8 months in jail for smuggling narcotics 
“This raises the question of the availability of instruments to open the suitcase and kit for testing the off-white powder,” the judge observes in the verdict.
He states that according to the complainant, the appellant was searched by Constable Naheed Akhtar but the woman officer was not produced as a witness.
The judge remarks that the investigating officer says the investigation was entrusted to him on Jan 10, 2018, and about 9am he reached the place of occurrence. He also admits that when he reached the place of occurrence, many people gathered there but he did not ask anything from any of them.
“He also admitted that he did not investigate as to how and when the luggage and narcotics were shifted from the airport to the Custom House, ‘’ notes the judge.
The judge further observes that the IO did not take CCTV footage at the airport during investigation though admitted that the cameras were installed outside and inside of the airport.
“In such like incident, the CCTV footage are mandatory which rule out the possibility of false implication to a good extent,” the judge maintains.
“Such are the lacunas in the prosecution case which cannot be ignored, therefore, obviously we can safely conclude that the prosecution has failed to bring the guilt against the appellant,” the verdict concludes.
The Czech model left Pakistan on Saturday after her release from the Kot Lakhpat jail.

5,Punjab govt in haste to get new law approved for LG election,Federal government asks Punjab to provide Rs9bn for onward transfer to the ECP for holding local government elections.,"LAHORE: The Punjab government has finalised the draft Punjab Local Government Act (PLGA) 2021 and it is hastily working to get it approved by the provincial cabinet, which is meeting on Tuesday (today), for tabling it in the Punjab Assembly next week while acting on Prime Minister Imran Khan’s direction to hold election by the coming March. 
The government is showing this haste following the Election Commission of Pakistan’s directions to hold local government (LG) elections within 120 days after Dec 31 when the current government’s five-year term expires.  

PLGA 2021 to get nod by cabinet

The PML-N is, however, pursuing its case of getting its almost two years that were wasted owing to suspension of the LG’s tenure by the incumbent PTI government. 
PM Khan, a couple of days ago, had directed the Punjab government to hold LG elections in the first quarter of the next year. He also constituted a three-member committee, comprising PTI chief organiser Saifullah Niazi, Aamir Kyani and Punjab Local Government Minister Mian Mahmoodur Rasheed, to select strong candidates for slots of chairmen of district councils and mayors. 
Meanwhile, the federal government has also asked Punjab to provide Rs9bn for onward transfer to the ECP for holding the elections. Sources say it would be tough for Punjab to spare Rs9bn– most probably by cutting the development budget. 
On the other hand, the officials close to the development say the government has not shared the draft law with other political parties. They suggest that the draft Act should have been shared widely and the parties as well as general public be allowed to speak their hearts out about it.  
The final PLGA 2021 manuscript proposes creation of 11 metropolitan corporations — nine at divisional headquarters and one each in Sialkot and Gujrat. It has also identified 15 municipal corporations and proposed a municipal corporation status for Murree. Each municipal corporation will have population less than 250,000 people. 
Similarly, 109 municipal committees and 125 town committees will be carved in the urban local governments having more than 50,000 and 25,000 population, respectively. 
The Punjab Local Government and Community Development (LG&CD) Department has proposed 1,883 neighbourhood councils and none of this council will be in any town committee. 
In the rural areas, the department has proposed 35 district councils and 3,364 village councils. 
Regarding mode of the LG elections, the government has proposed party-based as well as direct elections for all upper tiers, neighbourhood and village councils.
For the upper tiers, it proposed 37pc elections on the party-base, having panels comprising head, deputy head and councillors on reserved seats, while the 63pc through direct election to be held on the basis of closed list proportional representation of general councillors. This whole upper tier election will be held through only one ballot paper. 
Similarly, for the neighbourhood and village councils, the chairman, vice-chairman and councillors on reserved seats as a panel of seven will be held on a party basis while six general councillors will be elected on proportional representation, only on one ballot paper. 
The LG&CD department is also working to fix role of authorities and public sector companies in the metropolitan corporations, including PHAs, development authorities, WASAs, TEPAs, waste management companies, parking companies as well as sports, literacy and population welfare. 
The department has also proposed authorities in each district, including a health authority; a education authority; a social welfare authority, a population control authority and sports and recreation authority. 
The proposed law explains the composition of district authorities, including the lord mayor of metropolitan corporation as the chairperson and his nominated deputy mayor or member of the head’s cabinet as the vice chairperson; the chairperson of the district council and the head of the largest urban local government in the district as chairperson and the vice-chairperson (other than Lahore district); the district office of each devolved district level office of the respective government department shall be the secretariat of the district authority. 
The departmental head of each devolved district level office of the respective government department shall be the ex-officio chief executive officer of the authority.

8,Parvez raps govt for extending property tax regime to villages,LAHORE: Punjab Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Parvez Elahi criticised the government for what he said increasing the...,"LAHORE: Punjab Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Parvez Elahi criticised the government for what he said increasing the property tax and also bringing villages into the ambit of the levy as proceedings of the house resumed after a two-day break here on Monday.
Dissatisfied at the answers being given by parliamentary secretary Faisal Farooq to the written queries of the legislators during the Question Hour, the speaker postponed the questions related to the excise department for another day.
The chair also questioned inclusion of villages in the property tax domain and increasing the levy by 10 to 15 per cent.
The issue had been raised by MPA Malik Muhammad Arshad from Sahiwal through a question in which it was mentioned that the villages making a part of his constituency had been brought under the property tax domain.
“We’ve never heard about levying property tax on villages. Is there any law (legal cover) to collect the tax from rural areas? If it is so, then produce its schedule before the house,” ordered the speaker.
Admitting that a 10pc to 15pc increase had been made in property tax, the parliamentary secretary said some rural settlements were large enough to be considered a town (and thus are taxed like in the towns).
Mr Elahi also drew the government’s attention towards increasing use of drugs in schools. He asked the parliamentary secretary if the government had done anything in this regard or had the excise department itself become proactive to control the menace before it’s too late.
Law Minister Raja Basharat, responding to it, informed the house that a separate directorate was being established in the excise department to check drugs use. He said the police were also active to take action on the issue.
MPA Malik Arshad, however, challenged the minister, saying a separate directorate had already been established by the PML-N government and his party membership had been suspended for raising the issue of rising drug use among the youth.
Speaking on a point of order, PML-N’s Samiullah Khan castigated the ministers over their persistent absence from the house proceedings. He said that the ministers would look out for excuses to miss the session as they were losing interest in the governance.
PPP parliamentary leader Syed Hassan Murtaza also took the government to task over inflation. He said the opposition would somehow placate their electorate, but wondered what the treasury lawmakers would do when they would return to the masses to seek votes in the next elections.
Mr Murtaza was continuing his tirade when the chair put off the proceedings till Tuesday morning.

9,Anti-smog strategy for Lahore: Three-day weekly closure of education institutes ordered,LAHORE: The Punjab government on Monday announced closure of private offices and educational institutions in the...,"LAHORE: The Punjab government on Monday announced closure of private offices and educational institutions in the provincial capital on Mondays, in addition to the weekly holidays observed on Saturdays and Sundays from Nov 27 till Jan 15, 2022.
Last week, the Lahore High Court (LHC) had ordered the Punjab government to issue a notification directing private offices in Lahore to halve staff attendance in an effort to tackle smog.  
Punjab Relief Commissioner Babar Hayat Tarar issued the directive.
The order, applicable within the territorial limits of the Lahore Metropolitan Corporation cites evidence of “persistent deterioration in Air Quality Index of the city of Lahore, fluctuating from satisfactory to poor levels, which is likely to cause breathing discomfort, respiratory tract diseases and heart diseases” as major reasons for the decision.  
The directions include that all private offices being operated by companies, private sector entities and other individuals, within the territorial limits of Lahore Metropolitan Corporation, shall remain closed on every Monday, in addition to Saturday and Sunday, with effect from Nov 27, 2021 until Jan 15, 2022. However, their staff may work from home.
It further states all public and private educational institutions (universities, colleges, schools and academies etc.) in territorial limits of Lahore shall remain closed on every Monday, in addition to weekly holidays which shall be observed on Saturday and Sunday, with effect from Nov 27, 2021, until Jan 15, 2022. However, they may arrange virtual classes.
The step was taken after Lahore continuously topped the list of world cities with the most polluted air. The air quality levels of the city had been hazardous and unhealthy for the last two to three weeks.  
Meanwhile, All Pakistan Private Schools Federation (APPSF) President Kashif Mirza chaired a review meeting of the central executive committee on the current situation of smog.  
The APPSF meeting rejected the school closure due to smog issues, and instructed the private schools to ensure effective measures to tackle the current situation.
The participants said an irreparable educational loss of the students had already been done due to bad governance and policies of education authorities during Covid-19 pandemic.
They issued SOPs for schools to take measures for smog including wearing masks, sunglasses to prevent itchy eyes, no outdoor morning assembly, no outdoor sports activities, schools may revise and adjust timings during smoggy days, and schools may also conduct online classes, if needed.
Meanwhile, the Punjab transport department has imposed fines worth Rs4.913 million on smoke-emitting vehicles in different areas of the province during October and November. It also conducted challans of 12,176 vehicles while impounding 2,472 vehicles for emitting smoke on roads.
The department spokesperson claimed the DRTAs secretaries have been directed to challan and impound smoke-emitting vehicles for three days under the direction of the Judicial Water and Environment Commission.

11,Punjab police see social media ‘misuse’ in rising rape cases,"Main reasons for the increase in such crimes are misuse of social media and under-age employment, according to police.","LAHORE: The Punjab police have claimed that misuse of social media is one of the reasons behind an increase in crime relating to rape and child abduction.
Official statistics of the police department, also available with Dawn, reveal that as many as 3,085 incidents of rape, 180 of gang rape, 146 of child rape, 1,289 of child abduction and eight cases of murder-after-rape have been reported in the province during the first 10 months of 2021.  
The data also discloses that at least 10 police officials have been found involved in rape cases reported during the corresponding period.
It claims that as many as 4,130 culprits are in police custody while 298 others are on bail in these cases.  
The statistics signed by an additional inspector general (monitoring) of police also claim a 54 per cent conviction rate with a 23pc ratio of absconders in the crime incidents in-question.
Responding to questions asked by lawyer and activist, Abdullah Malik, under the Punjab Transparency & Right to Information Act 2013, the police department argued that the main reasons for the increase in such crimes are free registration of cases, misuse of social media and under-age employment.
Asked about any physiological study on the culprits involved in these crimes, the reply says, “The issue does not relate to the police department.”
To another query whether the department recommended any case study to make further legislation to eliminate the crime from society, it says “Zainab case” has been a test case in the history of Punjab police that has been successfully solved. The case also invited attention of various NGOs, it adds.  
Mr Malik says the department did not respond to his other query regarding police station wise data of cops involved in such crimes. He also disputes the conviction rate claimed by the police saying as per a previous data of such crimes shared by the department for the period of 2018-20 was not more than five per cent.
Talking to Dawn, Advocate Asad Jamal said the reasons claimed by the police department for the aforementioned crimes were not understandable except for underage employment of children without protection.  
He said terming the alleged “misuse of social media” one of the reasons for such crimes was an unsubstantiated fact. The police department must share more information on this aspect.  
He said there must have been an analysis and study of years before making such claim.  
The advocate opined that the bizarre reasons narrated by the police were nothing more than an act of diverting attention from its poor performance. Has any study been done by the police? Have they gathered reliable data? What do they mean by “misuse of social media”, by whom and how?  
Calling the police performance and capacity deplorable in preventing and detecting such crimes, Jamal referred to police departments of countries where, he said, psychologists and criminologists are engaged to prevent and investigate criminal activities including criminal acts for which cyber space is used. Our police should also take similar steps to improve their performance.

The incident brought about an embarrassment for the police which later lodged a case while nominating seven women, including Dua Chaudhry and three unidentified men, under various charges.
The police claimed that the stage actor and other women were holding mobile phones to record any police resistance to defame them or to get sympathies in case of any physical encounter as the police station had no policewoman to stop them.
The police said the actor had also warned that they would go to the higher forums if policemen even ‘touched’ her or her other female fellows.
Some witnesses told the media men that the actor forced her entry into the police station along with her accomplices almost an hour after the police raided her party she had organised at a private housing society where the locals had complained of some violations.  
They said Dua Chaudhry got upset over taking into custody of two employees Adnan Tariq and Abdullah from the venue. She asked the police to set both of her employees released. On resistance, Dua Chaudhry and others allegedly attacked the personnel, the police said.
They thrashed constable Gohar Ayub, tore his uniform and threatened him and others for raiding the event.  
The actor and other women later left with her two employees, according to a first information report (FIR) that was lodged by the police soon after the suspects fled.
The FIR was registered on the complaint of police official Tafheem who alleged that those women who attacked the police were identified as Dua Chaudhry, Fiza Adnan, Kainat, Sehar and others.
He said the police had responded to the emergency call of locals when they complained that the management misused the sound system at the event, causing a great deal of inconvenience to them.

Jhang District Police Officer Hassan Asad Alvi told the media on Monday that on Nov 15, Altaf Husain, his wife Nasreen Bibi and their minor daughter Bismillah, were found murdered in their house at Malloana Mor.  
When the incident happened, it was reported in the media, based on the first information report (FIR), that a youth (Altaf’s son Manzar Ali) had killed his parents and sister over their refusal to marry him of his choice and escaped. 
Jhang Saddar police had registered a case against Manzar on the complaint of Akhtar Abbas, his stepbrother. Akhtar had claimed in the FIR that his Manzar had axed his parents and sister to death because they were opposing his wish to marry with his cousin in Kasur.  

Suspects murdered five members of family, including father, over land 

The DPO added that he had constituted an investigation team, headed by DSP Saifullah Bhatti. During investigation, police took the complainant into custody for interrogation over his repeatedly changing statements.  
Akhtar confessed that he, in connivance with his real brother, Asghar Ali, wanted to occupy all property of their father, Altaf, who had contracted a second marriage with their maternal aunt after the death of their mother 25 years back. 
Both the brothers (Akhtar and Asghar) made a plot to grab the property of their father after killing him, their stepmother, stepsister and two stepbrothers. To execute their plan, the suspects first got their stepbrother, Sarwar Ali, strangled in January 2016 by two hired murderers who were paid Rs100,000. Early this month, the suspects murdered their second stepbrother Manzar (the suspect in the case) and buried his body in the fields. 
The same day they axed their father, stepmother and stepsister to death and registered a murder case against Manzar (whose body they had buried after his murdered), saying he had escaped after committing the murder. 
The DPO added that now the triple murder case had been converted into quintuple murder case while both the main suspects and the hired murders of their brother had been arrested.
