0,"All Germans will either be ‘jabbed, cured or dead’ this winter, warns minister","Belgium, Netherlands condemn clashes that rocked weekend protests against new anti-Covid measures.","BERLIN: Germans faced the stark warning on Monday that they would be either “vaccinated, cured or dead” from Covid by the end of winter, while Austria returned to a partial lockdown as Europe battles a fourth wave of the pandemic.
Belgium and the Netherlands meanwhile condemned clashes that rocked weekend protests against new anti-Covid measures, aimed at containing a surge in infections sweeping parts of the continent.
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte slammed three nights of unrest as “pure violence” by “idiots”, while his Belgian counterpart Alexander de Croo called the violence at a 35,000-strong protest in Brussels “absolutely unacceptable”.
The anger comes amid growing alarm over Europe’s return as the pandemic’s epicentre, blamed on a sluggish vaccine uptake in some nations, the highly contagious Delta variant and colder weather moving people indoors again.
“Probably by the end of this winter, as is sometimes cynically said, pretty much everyone in Germany will be vaccinated, cured or dead,” German Health Minister Jens Spahn said, as he urged more citizens to get the jab.
Outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that Germany’s current Covid curbs — including barring the unvaccinated from certain public spaces — “are not enough”.
“We have a highly dramatic situation” as new infections “double every 12 days”, Merkel told a meeting of leaders of her conservative CDU party, according to participants.
With intensive care beds swiftly filling up, Germany’s worst-hit regions have ordered new shutdowns, including the closure of Christmas markets.
The restrictions mirror those in neighbouring Austria, which re-entered a partial lockdown — shuttering shops, restaurants and festive markets — from Monday, the most drastic restrictions seen in Western Europe for months.
Its 8.9 million people are not allowed to leave home with few exceptions, such as going to work, shopping for essentials and exercising, as virus cases surge.
The Alpine nation also plans a vaccine mandate from Feb 1, one of few places in the world to so far to announce such a move. Austria’s schools and kindergartens remain open.
“Look around you, nobody is here,” said Anelia Lyotin, manning a stall in Vienna selling nuts and dried fruit.
“This situation now is bad for everyone and the only solution is that everyone gets vaccinated,” said the 36-year-old.
Across the border in Slovakia, unvaccinated people were also facing curbs blocking them from entering non-essential stores.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in European cities at the weekend to protest the stricter Covid rules, with anger boiling over in some places.
At least 145 people were arrested in the Netherlands over protests that began in Rotterdam on Friday, sparked by a Covid curfew, and spread to cities across the country. Several police officers were injured.
In Brussels on Sunday, officers fired water cannon and tear gas at a protest police said was attended by 35,000, demonstrating against a ban on the unvaccinated from venues such as restaurants and bars.
In Denmark this weekend, around 1,000 demonstrators protested government plans to reinstate a Covid pass for civil servants.
A crowd of 40,000 marched through Vienna on Saturday decrying “dictatorship”, while some 6,000 people protested in the city of Linz on Sunday.
French elite police and counter-terrorism officers arrived in Guadeloupe after a week of unrest over Covid measures, including looting, with President Emmanuel Macron pleading for calm on the French Caribbean island. The Red Cross said in a report Monday that the pandemic had damaged the “fabric of society”.

1,Inquiry finds ‘overwhelming evidence’ of misconduct by ex-NY governor,ALBANY: A legislative investigation released on Monday found overwhelming evidence that former Gov Andrew Cuomo...,"ALBANY: A legislative investigation released on Monday found overwhelming evidence that former Gov Andrew Cuomo sexually harassed women and that he ordered state workers to help produce his book on pandemic leadership during work hours.
The report also found that Cuomos staff substantially revised a state health department report on Covid-19 deaths in nursing homes to exclude statistics that might have dimmed his reputation as a pandemic leader.
The findings, authored by a law firm hired by the Assembly’s Judiciary Committee, were widely expected, and the sections on sexual harassment largely echo allegations previously made in a report last summer by the state’s attorney general.
But it offered some new details, particularly around the $5.2 million private deal Cuomo struck to write a book, American Crisis: Leadership Lessons on the Pandemic.
Cuomo had promised state ethics officials that no state resources would be used on the book, but the Assembly’s investigators at the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell said they found evidence the governor had his staff spend copious amounts of time on the project.
One senior state official explained that Book-related assignments were given by superiors and expected to be completed, and the work was not voluntary, the report said. “Another senior state official complained in a text message to a colleague that work on the Book was compromising the officials ability to work on Covid-related matters.” Junior and senior staff members told investigators they were asked to perform book tasks during their work day, including transcribing dictations, printing and delivering documents, and attending meetings with agents and publishers.
One senior state official sent and received 1,000 emails about the book, the report said. The report didn’t name the official, but included details identifying her as his former top aide, Melissa DeRosa. Cuomo, a Democrat, resigned in August to avoid a likely impeachment trial.
His spokesperson, Richard Azzopardi, and lawyer, Rita Glavin, didn’t immediately respond to request for comment on Monday.
Cuomo has denied sexually harassing anyone or touching any women inappropriately. For weeks, he has attacked the Assembly’s investigation as biased and set on smearing him.
The former governor faces a separate criminal charge alleging that he groped the breast of a former assistant, Brittany Commisso, after summoning her to the executive mansion on Dec 7, 2020.
The Assembly report said it had reviewed travel, phone and text messages that back up Commisso’s account of her whereabouts on the day she says the attack happened.
We conclude that there is overwhelming evidence that the former Governor engaged in sexual harassment, the report reads.
The investigators also examined allegations that Cuomo’s office had the state Department of Health delete a reference to 10,000 Covid-19 deaths among nursing home residents in a July 2020 state report.

2,Demonstrators demand foreign treatment for ailing Khaleda,DHAKA: Bangladesh police fired tear gas and around 20 people were injured on Monday as thousands of opposition...,"DHAKA: Bangladesh police fired tear gas and around 20 people were injured on Monday as thousands of opposition demonstrators demanded the government allow ailing ex-premier Khaleda Zia to fly abroad for treatment.
Zia, 76, arch-rival of current Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, was admitted to the critical care unit of a Dhaka hospital early this month after her health worsened, one of her doctors said.
She is currently barred by a court from travelling overseas after being convicted on graft charges in 2018.
“She is critically ill and now urgently needs treatment in developed countries such as the United States, Germany and Britain. There is no treatment for her in the region,” doctor A. Z. M. Zahid Hossain said.
Organisers said a protest outside Dhaka’s National Press Club drew more than 15,000 activists and supporters of Zia’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), but police put the number at around 7,000. Hundreds of police were deployed.
The BNP, which was last in power from 2001 to 2006, also staged demonstrations in dozens of other cities and towns across the country of 169 million people.
In the northern district of Natore “about 20 people were injured including three journalists” when BNP activists clashed with police who tried to thwart a procession, a police inspector said.
“They (BNP activists) threw rocks at police, who fired tear gas and (rubber bullets) from shotguns to disperse them,” he said.
Hossain, who is a vice president of the BNP, said Zia was suffering from liver disease, chronic kidney disease and a heart complaint in addition to her existing conditions of rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes.
Hasina last week appeared to reject her family and party’s pleas for treatment abroad.
“I have done whatever I can for Khaleda Zia. Now the law will decide the next course of action,” Hasina told a press briefing.
“Using whatever (authority) is in my hand, I have managed to keep Khaleda Zia at her home (not in jail),” she said.
Zia was sentenced to 10 years in prison in February 2018 on graft charges that her party says were politically motivated.
But she was released in March last year as her condition worsened in a jail where she was the only inmate. She has since been barred from flying abroad.
“On Feb 8, 2018, she walked to the jail without assistance. But when she was released on March 25, 2020, she came out in a wheelchair. Now she can’t move or do any normal activity without assistance,” Hossain said.

3,"Climate warming forecasts may be too rosy, says study","“The false precision may lead countries to believe they are making good progress when opposite may be true,” says one author.","PARIS: UN projections of how much current climate policies and national pledges to cut carbon pollution will slow global warming are more uncertain than widely assumed, researchers reported on Monday.
Leading into this month’s COP26 summit, the UN said existing policies would see Earth’s average surface temperature rise a “catastrophic” 2.7 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels by 2100.
Renewed pledges from large emitters such as India would have a negligible effect on warming this century, the UN said during COP26, and were still worlds away from the Paris Agreement temperature goal of 1.5C of warming.
But the apparent precision of these estimates is misleading, according to a new study, written by several contributors to the UN reports it calls into question. “The false precision to climate outcomes given during COP26 may lead countries to believe they are making good progress, when the opposite may be true,” said first author Ida Sognnaes, a senior scientist at the CICERO climate research centre in Oslo.
At issue is the standard method used to connect the dots between a set of climate policies and the end-of-century temperature increases they might lead to.
Most climate projections are based on models that start with the desired temperature outcome — a cap on global warming of 1.5C or 2C, for example — and then work backwards to see what policy levers need to be pulled in order to get there.
In this “backcasting” approach, experts adjust variables such as coal use, renewables and afforestation to hit the end-of-century target.
“Our study is a ‘forecast’,” said CICERO’s director of research Glen Peters. “We model out where existing policies take us and then see where we end up.” Seven different climate modelling groups used this technique to assess how voluntary pledges under the Paris treaty running to 2030 — known as nationally determined contributions — would play out by 2100.
Unrealistic scenarios
Their estimates, published in Nature Climate Change, ranged from 2.2C to 2.9C, roughly in line with the UN figures. What stood out, however, was the lack of certainty.
“If you take the low end of that range, it may sound like we are really close to meeting the Paris goals,” Peters said.
“But it is equally likely that the outcome could be up around 3C, in which case much stronger policies would be needed.” Peters compared the new study’s methods to those used to measure the impact of Covid policies such as mask wearing, social distancing or vaccination.
Since the outbreak of the pandemic in early 2020, Covid modelling has been updated every few months based on how policy is seen to be affecting the spread of the virus.
“New policy is based on where we are actually heading, not where we may have been heading if there was no action taken,” Peters said.
Most studies on global warming impacts contrast a worst-case scenario of unabated carbon emissions, on the one hand, with aggressively optimistic pathways to a 1.5C world on the other.
The reality, however, is somewhere in between these extremes, and is likely to stay there for decades.

KEIV: Ukraine, alarmed by a build-up of Russian troops near its borders, has held another military drill of airborne forces close to the capital Keiv, the defence ministry said on Monday.
The drills simulated the landing of airborne troops and armoured personnel carriers for an attack on an enemy target, the ministry said in a statement. It released footage showing the landing of troops, supported by aircraft and helicopters.
Last week, Ukrainian marines conducted drills near the borders of Russian-annexed Crimea.
The head of Ukraine’s military intelligence told the Military Times outlet this weekend that Russia had more than 92,000 troops amassed around Ukraine’s borders and was preparing for an attack by the end of January or beginning of February.
Kyrylo Budanov said such an attack would likely involve air strikes, artillery and armoured attacks followed by airborne assaults in the east, amphibious assaults in Odessa and Mariupol and a smaller incursion through neighbouring Belarus.
The Kremlin on Monday dismissed the suggestion and said it was alarmed that Ukraine was being supplied with large quantities of weapons and building up its own forces.
Ukraine, which aspires to become a Nato member, received a large consignment of US ammunition earlier this year and Javelin anti-tank missiles, prompting criticism from Moscow, which has said it has serious security concerns about the prospect of Ukraine joining Nato one day.
In the next few days Ukraine will also receive two refitted former US Coast Guard patrol boats designed to beef up its navy.

5,Indian farmers keep pressure on Modi despite climbdown,"“Our protests will end once the government passes the law on MSP,” says leader.","LUCKNOW: Flushed with victory after Prime Minister Narendra Modi caved into demands for agricultural reform laws to be repealed, Indian farmers held a mass rally on Monday to demand minimum support prices be extended to all produce, not just rice and wheat.
The protest movement launched by farmers more than a year ago became the most serious political challenge to the government, and resulted in Modi making a surprise commitment on Friday to roll back the reforms.
Thousands gathered for the latest rally in Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state, where Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party will seek to hold onto power in state elections due early next year. They turned their attention to minimum support prices (MSP), which were a side issue in the agricultural reform laws.
“Our battle is only half won,” Joginder Singh Ugrahan, a prominent farmers’ leader, said in an address to about 5,000 farmers waving flags of various farmer and labour organisations. “Ensuring that the government makes a law MSP is a big issue for all of us,” he said. “Our protests will end once the government passes the law on MSP.” Currently, the government mainly buys rice and wheat at minimum support prices or guaranteed prices, but the safety net benefits barely 6pc of India’s millions of farmers.
In a letter addressed to Modi on Sunday, the main farmers’ body said: “Minimum Support Price, based on the comprehensive cost of production, should be made a legal entitlement of all farmers (and) for all agricultural produce . . .” Farmers also asked in the letter for the federal government to withdraw a draft electricity bill, which they fear would lead to state governments withdrawing their right to free or subsidised power, used mainly for irrigation.

6,US blacklists financial facilitator for Afghan affiliate of IS,Also designated three men as Specially Designated Global Terrorists for their roles as leaders of the Afghan affiliate of IS.,"WASHINGTON: The United States on Monday imposed sanctions on an individual it accused of acting as a financial facilitator for the militant Islamic State group’s Afghanistan branch, in a move that follows a series of attacks in Kabul claimed by the militant group.
The US Treasury Department said it blacklisted Ismatullah Khalozai, accusing him of operating a Turkey-based informal money-moving network, known as a hawala, to transfer funds to finance the IS.
The State Department on Monday also designated three men as Specially Designated Global Terrorists for their roles as leaders of the Afghan affiliate of IS, according to the Treasury.
“Today’s designation underscores the United States’ determination to prevent ISIS-K and its members from exploiting the international financial system to support terrorist acts in Afghanistan and beyond,” said Andrea Gacki, director of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, using a common name for Islamic State-Khorasan Province.

7,India arrests prominent Kashmiri rights activist Khurram Parvez,National Investigation Agency officials also searched the Jammu Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society offices for more than 14 hours.,"SRINAGAR: India’s top anti-terrorism investigation agency on Monday arrested a prominent human rights activist in Indian-occupied Kashmir after raiding his home and office, his wife said.
Personnel from the National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested Khurram Parvez in Srinagar, his wife Samina said. They also confiscated Parvez’s mobile phone, laptop and some books, along with her cell phone. “They said it’s a case of ‘terror funding’,” she said.
Parvez, 42, is the programme coordinator for a widely respected rights group in the disputed territory, the Jammu Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society (JKCCS), and chairperson of the Asian Federation Against Involuntary Disappearances (AFAD).
The NIA did not immediately issue a statement about the arrest or raids, but an arrest warrant seen by this news agency shows that Parvez was arrested under various sections of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA).
“I’m hearing disturbing reports that Khurram Parvez was arrested today in Kashmir & is at risk of being charged by authorities in #India with terrorism-related crimes,” tweeted Mary Lawlor, the UN special rapporteur on human rights defenders.
“He’s not a terrorist, he’s a Human Rights Defender.” 

 



 
NIA officers searched the JKCCS offices for more than 14 hours.
The NIA also raided Parvez’s home and office in October last year, seizing research materials, phones and computer hard drives.
The rights group has monitored violence in the region for more than three decades and has exposed rights violations by Indian government forces including torture, extra-judicial killings and unmarked mass graves in numerous reports.
Last week, it criticised security forces for killing civilians during a controversial shootout with alleged rebels in Srinagar whose bodies were hurriedly buried by Indian police in a remote graveyard without their families present.
Following an outcry and protests by families of three of the victims, authorities exhumed two of the bodies and returned them to their families.
At least 2,300 people have been arrested under the UAPA — a vaguely worded law which effectively allows people to be held without trial indefinitely — in the Indian-occupied territory since 2019, when New Delhi cancelled the region’s partial autonomy and brought it under direct rule.
Almost half of them are still in prison, and convictions under the law are very rare.

8,Sudan govt frees several civilian leaders,"KHARTOUM: Sudanese authorities have released several civilian leaders detained since last month’s military coup, a...","KHARTOUM: Sudanese authorities have released several civilian leaders detained since last month’s military coup, a former captive said on Monday, amid efforts to restore a fragile transition process towards full democracy.
“I was released late yesterday evening,” following a deal to reverse the military takeover, the head of Sudan’s Congress Party, Omar al-Degeir, who was among civilians arrested in the army’s October 25 power grab, said.
“I was in solitary confinement and completely cut off from the world throughout this period.” The Congress Party, however, slammed Sunday’s deal, saying it “explicitly legitimised the continuation of the coup regime”.
Other civilian politicians were also released, including Sedeeq al-Sadiq al-Mahdi of the Umma Party, Sudan’s largest political group.
Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok’s advisor Yasser Arman, a leading figure of Sudan’s main civilian bloc, the Forces for Freedom and Change (FFC), was among those freed, according to Degeir. But other key civilian figures and ministers deposed in the coup have yet to be freed.
On Monday, 12 out of the 17 FFC members in Hamdok’s dismissed government, including foreign minister Mariam al-Mahdi, announced their resignation, refusing to collaborate with the coup leaders.
“We don’t question his integrity as a patriot or as a leader... but what happened yesterday was a setback, a setback in the trust,” she told the US think-tank, Atlantic Council, after Hamdok met with his cabinet.

10,"Democracy slipping away at record rate, warns IDEA",70pc of the global population now lives under non-democratic regimes.,"BRUSSELS: A greater number of countries are sliding towards authoritarianism, while the number of established democracies under threat has never been so high, the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA) said on Monday.
Populist politics, the use of Covid-19 pandemic restrictions to silence critics, a tendency of countries to mimic the anti-democratic behaviour of others, and disinformation used to divide societies are mainly to blame, the Stockholm-based intergovernmental organisation said in a report.
“More countries than ever are suffering from ‘democratic erosion’,” IDEA said in its 2021 study on the state of democracy, relying on data compiled since 1975.
“The number of countries undergoing ‘democratic backsliding’ has never been as high,” it said, referring to the regressive turn in areas including checks on government and judicial independence, as well as media freedom and human rights.

70pc of the global population now lives under non-democratic reg imes

Afghanistan, which was taken over by Taliban militants in August after international troops withdrew, is the most dramatic case this year, while Myanmar’s Feb 1 coup marked the collapse of a fragile democracy.
Other examples include Mali, which has suffered two coups since 2020, and Tunisia, where the president has dissolved parliament and assumed emergency powers.
Large democracies such as Brazil and the United States have seen presidents question the validity of election results, while India has witnessed the prosecution of groups of people critical of government policies.
Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Serbia are the European countries with the greatest declines in democracy. Turkey has seen one of the largest declines between 2010 and 2020.
“In fact, 70 per cent of the global population now live either in non-democratic regimes or in democratically backsliding countries,” the report said.
The Covid-19 pandemic has led to a surge in authoritarian behaviour by governments. The study said that there was no evidence that authoritarian regimes were better at fighting the pandemic, despite Chinese state media reports to the contrary.
“The pandemic provides additional tools and justification for repressive tactics and silencing of dissent in countries as diverse as Belarus, Cuba, Myanmar, Nicaragua and Venezuela,” the report said.
