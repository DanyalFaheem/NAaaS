His team trailing 1-0 and being outplayed at home by an injury-hit Leeds United, it likely dawned on Antonio Conte that he had a bigger job on his hands at Spurs than he might have imagined. 
Even without key men Raphinha and Patrick Bamford, a youthful Leeds were well worth their half-time lead thanks to Daniel James’ first goal for the club. 
But Conte’s half-time team talk made all the difference. 
Tottenham came out with much more intensity and delivered a second-half performance more in their new manager’s image as goals by two unlikely sources Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Sergio Reguilon secured a 2-1 win on Sunday. 
Hojbjerg’s scuffed shot found the bottom corner to level just before the hour-mark and Reguilon grabbed the winner with his first Spurs goal after Eric Dier’s deflected free-kick came back off the post. 
It was a first league win under Conte since the Italian replaced Nuno Espirito Santo as Tottenham manager before the international break. His renowned passion was evident in the final minutes as he whirred his arms, urging fans to get behind the players to see out victory. 
They did, and Spurs climbed to seventh place above Manchester United, who plunged even lower in the standings on the day they fired manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer after a string of humiliating results. 
Conte was once linked with potentially replacing Solskjaer at United but he has ended up at Tottenham and has yet to lose, having started with a win in the Europa Conference League and a 0-0 draw at Everton in the Premier League. 
“At halftime, the players showed me they could win this game,” Conte said. “In the second half I corrected the situation ... I look at the stats and Leeds are the best in the league for running and the intensity. In the second half we changed something tactically and in the intensity we beat them.”

3,Napoli finally beaten as Inter fire title warning shot,MILAN And then there were none.,"MILAN And then there were none. 
Serie A leaders Napoli lost for the first time this season as Inter Milan reinvigorated their title bid with a 3-2 win on Sunday. 
Inter, the defending champions, cut the gap on Napoli and AC Milan to four points after 13 rounds and ended Napoli’s status as the last remaining unbeaten team across Europe’s five major leagues. 
Dries Mertens, who had set up a pulsating finale with his club-record 137th goal for Napoli, missed the chance to equalise in injury time when he blazed his shot over. 
“It was a very tactical match and we could have drawn it in the end,” said Napoli coach Luciano Spalletti on his first return to the San Siro in Milan since he was fired by Inter after finishing fourth in 2019. 
Spalletti’s players wore jerseys paying tribute to football great Diego Maradona, who died on Nov 25 last year. 
It was another Argentine who scored the winning goal. Lautaro Martinez scored Inter’s third after a heart-pounding upfield surge from compatriot Joaquin Correa in the 61st minute. 
Inter goalkeeper Samir Handanovic preserved the result with a brilliant save to deny Mario Rui in injury time, forcing the ball onto the crossbar, before Mertens’ miss. 
To make matters worse for Napoli, Spalletti also had to watch two of his players come off worse in clashes of heads. 
Star striker Victor Osimhen had to leave the field 10 minutes after the break after he and Milan Skriniar thumped into each other, with Napoli revealing late on Sunday that the Nigeria attacker had suffered  “multiple fractures” of his left cheekbone and eye socket. 
Goalkeeper David Ospina also collapsed to the ground in worrying fashion after his head whacked into Inter substitute Edin Dzeko’s, but both players carried on with their heads bandaged. 
The visitors had struck first in the 17th when Piotr Zielinski won the ball off Nicolo Barella and ran forward to score from Lorenzo Insigne’s pass. 
Hakan Calhanoglu levelled the scores from the penalty spot midway through the first half and Ivan Perisic headed Inter’s second before the break.
Felix Afena-Gyan made sure that Andriy Shevchenko got off to a losing start in charge of Genoa with the teenage substitute scoring both goals in a 2-0 win for AS Roma on a soaking night on the Italian Riviera.
The 18-year-old Ghanaian slotted home the opener eight minutes from the end in the middle of a downpour at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris and then curled home a stunning long range effort in stoppage time before charging over to celebrate with coach Jose Mourinho. 
His goals, the first by a Serie A player born in 2003, move Roma to fifth, three points behind Atalanta in the final Champions League spot. 
Shevchenko has a job on his hands at Genoa whose anaemic display meant they stay in the relegation zone after being put there earlier in the day by local rivals Sampdoria’s 2-0 win at Salernitana. The defeat left the promoted side bottom in Cagliari’s place. 
Earlier, a penalty from Brazilian forward Joao Pedro helped Cagliari to a 2-2 draw at Sassuolo.
Also, Nigerian forward David Okereke’s second-half goal was enough for Venezia to come away from Bologna with a surprise 1-0 win.

4,Sri Lankan spinners put West Indies in trouble,"After Sri Lanka’s pacers failed to take a wicket, the spinners made hay as off-spinner Ramesh Mendis claimed three wickets.","GALLE: The West Indies were on Monday in deep trouble in the first Test against Sri Lanka as they collapsed to 113 for six at stumps on day two in reply to the hosts’ first innings total of 386 all out.
The tourists, hunting their first-ever Test win in Sri Lanka, trailed by 273 runs with four wickets in hand at the Galle International Stadium.
After Sri Lanka’s pacers failed to take a wicket, the spinners made hay as off-spinner Ramesh Mendis claimed three wickets and left-arm orthodox duo Praveen Jayawickrama and Lasith Embuldeniya shared three wickets between them.
Openers Kraigg Brathwaite and Jermaine Blackwood had added 46 runs for the first wicket before Embuldeniya provided the breakthrough trapping Blackwood leg-before for 20.
Jayawickrama was operating from the City End and Nkrumah Bonner (one) gloved one to first slip where Dhananjaya de Silva took a low catch.
Mendis came into the attack in the 32nd over, replacing Jayawickrama and claiming two wickets in two balls to put the West Indies in all sorts of trouble. He struck on the last ball of his first over when Brathwaite was caught at leg-slip.
Brathwaite had looked solid on his way to 41 off 115 deliveries with seven fours and had successfully overturned a decision before tea.
“Personally disappointed not to go on after getting a start,” he told reporters.  “Hopefully I will make up next time.”
Mendis struck again in the first ball of his second over when Shai Hope was well caught by Oshada Fernando at short leg. He made 10.
Hope had come in as a concussion substitute for Jeremy Solozano. On his Test debut, Solozano was taken to hospital on the first morning when a full-blooded pull shot from Dimuth Karunaratne smashed into his helmet.
He spent the night under observation but scans revealed no serious injuries other than concussion and he returned to Galle and spent time in the team hotel after being discharged.
Jayawickrama changed ends and came on from the Dutch Fort End to pick up a second wicket as Jomel Warrican edged to wicket-keeper Dinesh Chandimal and then exhausted a review as the West Indies middle order collapsed, losing four wickets for 20 runs.
Earlier on Monday, the West Indies bowled out Sri Lanka for 386, Roston Chase claiming a five-wicket haul.
Among his victims were Karunaratne, whose classy 147 came to an end when Joshua da Silva completed a smart stumping.
The West Indies still need 74 runs to avoid the follow-on, but Karunaratne wants to play it safe.
“I don’t think it’s the most sensible thing to do. Nobody wants to bat last in Galle,” he said. “We need to first bowl them out and then put some runs on the board. It will give bowlers some breathing space too.”
Karunaratne was invo­lved in two hundred-plus stands with Pathum Nis­sanka (56) and Dhananjaya de Silva (61). Chandimal chipped in with 45 runs.

5,Pakistan shrug off late jitters to seal T20 sweep over Bangladesh,DHAKA: Mohammad Nawaz struck a boundary off the last ball as Pakistan overcame late drama to beat Bangladesh by five...,"DHAKA: Mohammad Nawaz struck a boundary off the last ball as Pakistan overcame late drama to beat Bangladesh by five wickets in Monday’s third and final Twenty20 International for a series whitewash.
Bangladesh totalled a mediocre 124-7 on a two-paced wicket that had variable bounce, but a slow approach meant Pakistan needed eight runs off the final six balls.
Captain Mahmudullah Riyad came on to bowl his only over of the day and dismissed Sarfaraz Ahmed and Haider Ali in consecutive deliveries before Iftikhar Ahmed smashed a huge six off the fourth ball, denying him a hat-trick.
With two runs needed off two balls, Iftikhar went for glory but ended up being caught for six at backward point. New batsman Nawaz then hit a four through extra cover to take to 127-5 and break Bangladesh hearts. 
Mahmudullah finished with 3-10 from his solitary over. 
“The pitch was a tricky one,” player-of-the-series Mohammad Rizwan said. “Whenever you play away, you get on different kinds of pitches. But we try to stick to our process.” 
Pakistan skipper Babar Azam was dismissed for 19 while Rizwan’s 51-run partnership with Haider gave the tourists an early boost. 
Paceman Shohidul Islam, making his debut, bowled Rizwan for 40 to break the stand but Haider appeared to be in full control, hitting 45 in 38 balls with three fours and two sixes before falling. 
Mahmudullah had opted to bat first but debut paceman Shahnawaz Dhani, leg-spinner Usman Qadir and fast bowler Mohammad Wasim claimed two wickets apiece to restrict Bangladesh to their low score. 
Dhani took a wicket in his first over by removing Najmul Hossain Shanto for five before Wasim and Usman rattled the hosts.
Wasim claimed 2-15 and Qadir finished with 2-35 playing his first match in the series. 
Mohammad Naim ended up as the top-scorer for the home team with 47 off 50 balls. 
“Batters from both teams struggled a bit,” Mahmudullah said at the end of the match. “[We] needed to spend some time at the crease to capitalise. Naim batted well.” 
Babar credited Pakistan’s team spirit for the series whitewash. 
“The way every individual has performed, credit to the group. There is always scope for improvement,” he said. 
Pakistan won the first game by four wickets and the second by eight wickets. 
The visitors will now play two Test matches, starting in Chittagong on November 26.

6,"China, US team up at worlds to mark ‘ping-pong diplomacy’",“Ping-pong diplomacy” was triggered by a meeting between a Chinese and an American player at the 1971 world championships.,"BEIJING: China and the United States will team up for the mixed doubles event at the World Table Tennis Championships finals this month on the 50th anniversary of “ping-pong diplomacy”, the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) said on Monday. 
“Ping-pong diplomacy” was triggered by a meeting between a Chinese and an American player at the 1971 world championships and helped mend relations between the two countries. 
The meeting resulted in an American table tennis team being invited to China to play what the Chinese know as “ping-pong”, ultimately paving the way for US President Richard Nixon’s trip to the country in 1972. 
China’s Lin Gaoyuan and Wang Manyu will partner Americans Lily Zhang and Kanak Jha, respectively, at the Nov 23-29 event in Houston, the ITTF said in a statement. 
“I’m really happy to be partnering with Lily Zhang for the mixed doubles event,” Lin said. “She’s the top table tennis player in the US. I’m not China’s top player yet, but our goal is to come out on top for this event. 
“The biggest advantage about pairing with her is that she speaks Mandarin. I hope we can get into the groove soon, develop good chemistry and work hard towards a great performance.” 
The two American-Chinese pairings will “build on the China-US friendship” and open “a new chapter of ‘ping-pong diplomacy’ in this new era”, Chinese Table Tennis Association president Liu Guoliang said in a statement.
The ITTF declared that “history will be made in Houston”. 
The 50th anniversary comes amid tense relations between the two countries, with the world’s top two economies at loggerheads over a number of issues, including the fate of China’s Uyghur minority and a clampdown in Hong Kong. 
But Chinese officials and state media have hailed the anniversary as a largely positive opportunity to cele­brate ping-pong diplo­macy’s “wonderful legacy”.

7,"Bangladesh pick uncapped Mahmudul, Raja for first Pakistan Test",All-rounder Shakib Al Hasan is also included in the squad but needs to have his fitness assessed.,"DHAKA: Bangladesh have called up uncapped duo Mahmudul Hasan Joy and Rejaur Rahman Raja for the first Test against Pakistan in Chittagong that starts on Friday.
All-rounder Shakib Al Hasan is also included in the squad but needs to have his fitness assessed.
“We will obviously have to wait and see if Shakib makes it for the first test but the players who are in the squad have been the most consistent performers for us in tests and their presence can make a difference,” chief selector Minhajul Abedin said on Monday.
Experienced opening batsman Tamim Iqbal has opted out of the series due to injury.
The two newcomers made their way into the squad based on their performances in the longer form of the game, according to Abedin.
Batsman Mahmudul, 21, has made a promising start to his first-class career with two hundreds in the National Cricket League while medium-pacer Raja, 22, picked up 33 wickets in 10 first-class matches.
“It is still early days for him but Mahmudul has showed good temperament for the longer version,” Abedin said.
“He is also an in-form batsman. With injury concerns to Taskin [Ahmed] and Shoriful [Islam], we needed to keep our pace bowling options open and Raja got the nod. We have been monitoring his performances in first-class competitions. He is strong and energetic and has a knack for taking wickets.”
The second Test is in Dhaka from Dec. 4-8.
Bangladesh squad for first Test: Mominul Haque (Captain), Shadman Islam, Saif Hasan, Najmul Hossain Shanto, Mushfiqur Rahim, Liton Das, Nurul Hasan Sohan, Mehidy Hasan Miraz, Nayeem Hasan, Taijul Islam, Ebadot Hossain, Abu Jayed Rahi, Yasir Ali, Mahmudul Hasan Joy, Rejaur Rahman Raja, Shakib Al Hasan.

Alexander Zverev showed off new, more aggressive, tactics in a dominant 6-4, 6-4 win over second-ranked Daniil Medvedev on Sunday to lift the trophy at the ATP Finals for the second time.
A day after beating top-ranked Novak Djokovic over three sets in the semi-finals, Zverev raised his game to a new dimension.
“It was definitely a game plan,” Zverev said. “He’s one of the best baseline players in the world, and against him you need to take control over the points, and I did that today and thats why it worked out very well for me.”
The 24-year-old Zverev, who did not face a single break point in the final, has now won six titles in six finals this year — including Olympic gold in Tokyo and two Masters titles in Madrid and Cincinnati.
Zverev became only the fourth player to beat the top two players in the world in the semis and final of the season-ending tournament.
Victory was also sweet revenge for Zverev, who lost in three sets to Medvedev in the round robin stage and came into the match having lost his last five meetings against the Russian.
He also stopped Medvedev from becoming the first player to retain the trophy since Djokovic won it four times in a row between 2012 and 2015.
It’s been a great season. It’s not easy to get to the Masters final and for myself I was really happy to be here,” said Medvedev. Hopefully I’m going to be a part of many of these tournaments and can try to win one more time.”
Earlier, French duo Pierre-Hugues Herbert and Nicolas Mahut won their second ATP Finals doubles title by beating American Rajeev Ram and Briton Joe Salisbury 6-4, 7-6 (7-0).

The opening match will take place next Nov. 21 in the 60,000 capacity Al Bayt Stadium. 
The head of soccer’s world governing body urged LGBTQ football fans and all others to attend the tournament and “engage and speak and convince” in a bid to influence the Gulf Arab state’s policies. 
“We cannot think that if we stay home and just criticize things will change. Things have improved. Things will continue to improve,” he said. 
At the event on Sunday night, football stars like David Beckham and Samuel Eto’o watched a drone display from a jetty in Doha’s West Bay as organisers promised a “spectacular” tournament. 
But on the sidelines officials were on the defensive about key issues that have dogged the tournament for years like Qatar’s anti-LGBTQ laws, the welfare of migrant workers and allegations of corruption. 
Nasser Al Khater, CEO of the 2022 World Cup, defended the country’s record in a virtual roundtable with reporters on Saturday night. 
“Qatar has been unfairly treated and scrutinized I think, unfairly treated for a number of years,” Al Khater said. 
He denied allegations by the US Department of Justice that bribes had been paid to secure votes when Qatar was awarded the hosting rights in 2010. 
He also defended the country’s progress on human rights, pointing to recent labour reforms, but cautioning that there is more work to do. 
Amnesty International recently said those labour reforms have not improved workers’ lives and that practices like withholding salaries and charging workers to change jobs were still commonplace. Qatar’s government rejected Amnesty’s findings. 
On Friday, the International Labour Organisation said Qatar was inadequately investigating and reporting the deaths of workers in the country.

11,‘Crowd problems put future of French football at risk’,"“Everyone must understand that it’s the survival of French soccer that’s at stake,” says Sports Minister Roxana Maracineanu.","PARIS: Repeated crowd problems in Ligue 1 are putting the future of French football at risk, French Sports Minister Roxana Maracineanu said after Sunday’s game between Olympique Lyonnais and Olympique Marseille was abandoned due to fan violence. 
The disciplinary commission of the French League (LFP) on Monday said that Lyon would play their Ligue 1 home games behind closed doors until it rules on the incident on Dec 8 after an investigation.  
The French “Olympico” was called off almost two hours after being suspended when Marseille’s Dimitri Payet was hit by a bottle thrown from the Groupama Stadium stands. 
Referee Ruddy Buquet sent the players to the dressing room after Payet fell to the ground as he was preparing to take a corner kick.
Payet missed training on Monday and French website RMC Sport reported that Marseille would press charges.
The stadium announcer initially said the match would restart, following a decision made by local Lyon authorities.  
This was criticised by the French League (LFP), which called for an emergency meeting of its disciplinary panel on Monday, resulting in Lyon playing home matches without spectators starting with next Wednesday’s game against Stade de Reims.  
“They have to come to an agreement, this kind of problem is for the League to solve,” Maracineanu told France Info radio on Monday, her office later saying the sports and interior ministries would meet over the matter on Tuesday.  
The interior ministry added that the French federation and the LFP have been summoned to the meeting.  
“Everyone must understand that it’s the survival of French soccer that’s at stake,” Maracineanu said.  
Similar incidents have marred domestic football since the start of the season, many of them involving Marseille, and LFP said it is destroying the image of the league in France and internationally.  
Payet was also hit by a bottle during a game at Nice in August. He had been heckled by Lyon supporters while warming up before kick-off.  
Nice were docked a point after the incident with Marseille, who on Wednesday were ordered to play their next home game behind closed doors after trouble during last month’s clash with Paris Saint-Germain. 
The game between Nice and Marseille was halted with 15 minutes left and replayed in its entirety two months later on neutral ground in Troyes and without fans.  
Nice were also ordered to play three games behind closed doors. Lens incurred a similar punishment following a pitch invasion during September’s northern derby against Lille. 
Earlier on Sunday, Amine Gouiri scored twice as Nice rallied past Clermont 2-1 to climb to second place, 11 points behind leaders PSG, after Lens were thrashed 4-0 by Brest. Lens dropped to fourth place, two points behind Nice.  
Angers moved into sixth place by edging Lorient 1-0 with a penalty from Thomas Mangani in the 67th.  
Strasbourg equalised with the last kick of the game in a 1-1 draw with Reims as substitute Jean-Ricner Bellegarde curled home a free kick in the seventh minute of  stoppage time.
St Etienne remained in the relegation zone despite beating Troyes 1-0 with a powerful long-range strike from Peru defender Miguel Trauco in the 61st.  
Opa Nguette came off the bench and scored twice to help bottom side Metz rally from a 2-0 deficit and draw 3-3 with Girondins Bordeaux.

Since being handed the job on a full-time basis in 2016, the former England international has revitalised the nation’s fortunes, taking them to the 2018 World Cup semi-finals and the final of European Championship this year. 
The 51-year-old Southgate’s future had been the source of some uncertainty with his much-admired work with the national team making him a candidate for some of the top club jobs. 
Southgate’s deal was set to expire after next year’s World Cup but he has been rewarded after England reached the Euro 2020 final — their best performance at a major tournament for 55 years. The new deal means he and his assistant Steve Holland will lead England to next year’s 2022 World Cup finals before taking them through qualifying for Euro 2024. 
“There was never a consideration I wouldn’t go to Qatar,” Southgate said. “I wanted to be sure I was wholly committed beyond that. We have a great opportunity in front of us and I know they and the fans are all excited about what this squad could achieve in future.”

Marco Asensio, Nacho Fernandez, Vinicius Jr and Ferland Mendy were on target for Real, who reached 30 points from 13 league matches, one more point than Real Sociedad, who were held to a 0-0 draw at home against Valencia. Real are two points in front of Sevilla, who drew 2-2 at home against Alaves on Saturday. 
Carlo Ancelotti’s team made a bright start and were 2-0 ahead after 25 minutes with goals from Asensio and Nacho, both from assists by Kroos. 
But Real got a scare a few minutes later, when a shot from Luis Suarez deflected off Nacho and deceived Real keeper Thibaut Courtois, who dived to the left as the ball slowly crossed the goal line to his right.
Granadas hopes of a comeback were short lived, however, as Real got back on top after the break and Vinicius extended their lead, finishing off a beautiful team move that also involved Karim Benzema and Casemiro. 
After Granada’s Monchu was sent-off for an ugly sliding tackle on Vinicius, Mendy wrapped up the scoring for the visitors. 
Real Betis ended their three-game losing streak in all competitions with a convincing 3-0 win at 18th-placed Elche. 
Getafe beat 16th-placed Cadiz 4-0 at home to move off the bottom of the table and push Levante there.

Freiburg, who had suffered their first league loss of the season in their last game against Bayern, are on 22 points, with Borussia Dortmund on 27 in second and Bayern on 28. 
It was Eintracht’s second win in a row and the Eagles had a bit of luck on their side when Jesper Lindstrom benefited from a bad clearance to take the lead in the 34th minute. 
Freiburg had had the better chances but they were even unluckier in the 42nd minute when Filip Kostic whipped in a an awkward free kick that sailed past half a dozen players with none making contact before sailing in at the far post as keeper Mark Flekken looked on. 
Eintracht climbed to 11th in the 18-team division, ahead of Cologne on goal difference. Cologne drew at Mainz 05 1-1 in the late game, when their top-scorer Anthony Modeste was forced off with an injury. 
Jonathan Burkardt put Mainz ahead against the run of play with a cool cut inside and finish shortly before half-time. The visitors bounced back early in the second half when defender Salih Ozcan headed in a Mark Uth free-kick to level the scores and claim his first ever Bundesliga goal.
