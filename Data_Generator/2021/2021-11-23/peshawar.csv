They were addressing a meeting of farmers, who had gathered here to celebrate their release from jail.
Liaqat Yousafzai, central president of Tobacco Growers Association Pakistan, Arif Ali Khan, president of Ittehad Kashtkaran, and two other leaders, Mohammad Dagiwal and Inayat Ali Shah Bacha were sent to jail under Maintenance of Public Order in the first week of November.
On this occasion, Inyat Ali Bacha said they expected the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government to protect the interests of the small growers, but it had failed to do so. “The current year is the worst year for the poor growers as the government toed the policy of the purchasing companies,” he said.
Addressing the growers, Arif Ali said exploitation of growers by multinational and national companies won’t be allowed at any cost.
The grower leaders said according to their information there were still 800,000 kilogrammes of tobacco lying with the growers.
The growers also constituted a central organising committee to run a month-long campaign across the tobacco growing regions of the province to solicit their suggestions on how to stop their exploitation at the hands of purchasing companies. They said the campaign would culminate into a farmers’ convention in Swabi on Dec 20 to announce a future line of action.
Arif Ali Khan was nominated president and Liaqat Yousafzai general secretary of the committee, which also includes leaders from all tobacco growing districts.
FIVE ARRESTED: The police on Monday arrested five people and recovered a Kalashnikov, a rifle and a pistol along with several rounds from them for resorting to firing in Kalu Khan area.
SHO Kalu Khan police station Fayyaz Khan said members of the two groups traded fire over an old enmity, which created panic among people of the area.

3,"KP speaker to put absentee MPAs on notice, send their cases to ECP",Directs members of the assembly’s staff to not mark absent lawmakers as present afterwards.,"PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly Speaker Mushtaq Ahmed Ghani on Monday announced the issuance of notices to the lawmakers absent from the house’s proceedings for six consecutive days as the lack of quorum disrupted the sitting.
The sitting was adjourned after two headcounts as only 17 out of 145 lawmakers were found present in the assembly in the last count.
The issue of lack of interest in the house’s proceedings by both lawmakers of the opposition as well as government has consistently plagued the current session that forced the chair to express his displeasure time and again.
Mr Ghani had earlier announced the installation of biometric system to record the attendance of lawmakers in the assembly. However, on Monday the speaker expressed his helplessness to overcome the nonchalant attitude of both treasury and opposition lawmakers.
“What can I do,” apparently exasperated Ghani asked labour and human rights minister Shaukat Ali Yousafzai saying the 145-member house is almost empty.

Questions deferred due to absence of ministers, sitting adjourned over lack of quorum

“As the next step, I will send notices to lawmakers abstaining from the proceedings for six consecutive days and will refer their cases to the Election Commission of Pakistan,” he said, adding that the assembly’s rules of business empowered him to act against absentee MPAs.
He directed members of the assembly’s staff not to mark absent lawmakers as present afterwards.
“I will take action against officials showing absent MPAs as present,” he said, adding that the secretariat had received around 40 leave applications.
However, the casual attitude towards the house’s proceedings by both lawmakers and government makes itself evident in one way or the other.
MPA Nadia Sher of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf pointed out the lack of quorum when Deputy Speaker Mahmood Jan chaired the proceeding after the departure of Speaker Mushtaq Ghani.
On a point of order, Opposition Leader Akram Khan Durrani drew the chair’s attention towards the absence of members from the house, especially cabinet members.
He said the assembly was losing prestige as neither treasury nor opposition members were taking interest.
Similarly, the elementary and secondary education department informed the house in a written response to a question of MPA Nighat Yasmin Orakzai, “Rs23.5 million has been spent out of a sum of Rs13 million released from an allocation for the Government Girls Degree College Parachinar No 2.” The total college allocation is Rs22 million, according to it.
Apparently, there’s little checking of the written departmental response to the lawmakers’ questions before being shared with the provincial assembly.
Several questions were deferred due to the absence of elementary and secondary education minister Shahram Tarakai and health minister Taimur Saleem Khan Jhagra.
The assembly was informed that 71 schools had been closed down in Peshawar district due to a lack of students.
Minister Shaukat Yousafzai said the enrolment in those schools was very low, so the department closed the schools down and shifted their students to the nearby schools.
The question was referred to the house’s relevant standing committee.
Awami National Party MPA Bahadur Khan said the elementary and secondary education department had failed to comply with the decision of the house’s standing committee regarding the commissioning of government middle school for boys in Jandol area of Lower Dir district.
He said the committee had directed the department to provide staff to the school, which was built four years ago, for the resumption of classes.
Opposition Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal member Inayatullah Khan, through a calling attention notice, asked the government to regularise around 1,000 employees of the defunct People’s Primary Healthcare Initiative, including doctors and technicians.
He said those employees continued to perform their respective duties without getting salaries and that the government should regularise their services.
Minister Shaukat Yousafzai said he couldn’t comment on the matter as it was sub judice.
He said initially, a private organisation, Sarhad Rural Support Programme, recruited those employees.
The chair referred the notice to the committee.
The assembly passed the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Waqf Properties (Amendment) Bill, 2021, after incorporating two amendments of Pakistan Peoples Party MPA Nighat Yasmin Orakzai.
Special assistant to the chief minister Zahoor Shakir said the purpose of that amendment was to bring the rent of Auqaf properties on a par with the present market rate.
He said the department received Rs6,000 rent from a unit against the market rate’s Rs70,000.
The assembly passed the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincially Administered Tribal Areas Levies Force (Amendment) Bill, 2021. Also, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Appointment of Law Officers (Amendment) Bill, 2021, was introduced.

The police identified the deceased cop as Amjad Khan, who was serving as investigation officer at the Bhadbher police station.
An official of the Khazana police station told Dawn that the cop was on way to workplace from Sikandar Khan Dheri area when two unidentified motorcyclists targeted him near the Toda Stop.

5,Protests gridlock traffic in Peshawar,PESHAWAR: Three protest demonstrations on a major thoroughfare outside the provincial assembly building caused...,"PESHAWAR: Three protest demonstrations on a major thoroughfare outside the provincial assembly building caused traffic gridlock for several hours here on Monday.
The protesters showed up in large numbers to press for their demands as the assembly resumed session.
They included employees of the Worker Welfare Board and the residents of Malakand and Lakki Marwat districts.
The protests led to the suspension of traffic on Khyber Road from afternoon to evening causing traffic mess on GT Road along with downtown and adjacent roads.
Cars crawled along bumper to bumper on the GT Road, one of the city’s busiest arteries, forcing drivers to wait for hours in long queues.
The WWB employees protested the closure of four board schools and alleged that the closure of 18 technical institutes managed by the board across the province was also on the cards threatening the jobs of around 300 people.
They said they would continue with the protest until their demands, especially job security, were met.
The Malakand residents protested the arrest of citizen journalist Mohammad Zada, while the people of Lakki Marwat staged protest against the deputy commissioner of their district. The Lakki protesters alleged that the DC had ordered the torture of the Marwat youths.
The traffic police said on their Twitter handle that the flow of heavy traffic on Northern Bypass and Chamkani Mor-Suray Pul Road began at around 1pm and within an hour or so, the thoroughfare was blocked due to the protests.
The protests also caused the blocking of the Amn Chowk-Suray Pul section of Khyber Road and slowing of traffic on other roads in the provincial capital.
The residents turned to social media to resent the prolonged road blockage.
“What on earth is happening in Peshawar because I have been asked to cancel around five Careem rides in half an hour since roads are either closed or there is a traffic jam,” wrote social media user Wajeeha on Twitter.

7,Govt yet to fix service charges for private hospitals,PHC issued directives for the purpose about two years ago,"PESHAWAR: The health department has not fixed consultation fee for doctors and rates for diagnostic services in private sector despite the directives of Peshawar High Court issued two years ago, according to officials.
They said that in July 2020, Peshawar High Court ordered Healthcare Commission Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to fix rates for medical tests, including Covid-19 and dengue in consultation with private laboratories after complaints were lodged by people.
Officials said that no progress was made on the issue as HCC was not empowered under the law to do so and health department was in the process of establishment of another office to look exclusively the charges at the private sector hospitals and laboratories.
“Punjab Healthcare Commission is empowered to fix consultation fee and rates for private diagnosis centres but in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa the law does not authorise the commission to issue rates for laboratory tests, X-ray, MRI and CT scan etc in addition to fixation of consultation fee of doctors,” they told this scribe.

PHC issued directives for the purpose about two years ago

Officials said that after instructions were issued by PHC, a report was submitted to health department wherein HCC informed it about the legal situation and proposed establishment of a separate body to fix rates for laboratories and doctors.
“Under the Healthcare Commission Act, 2015, we are required to regulate the health outlets and ensure that people get quality care. The commission has carried out categorisation of the health facilities both in public and private sectors but the task of fixing rates does not come under its domain,” they said.
Officials said that health department constituted a committee for the purpose comprising senior medical consultants with director-general health services as its head. They said that a report regarding the matter was submitted in the court two years ago. They added that after a few meetings, the committee discontinued work and the issue went into hibernation.
They acknowledged that it was a big issue for patients to pay high fee for tests and checkups at private laboratories and hospitals. They said that there were no fixed rates for any test either in private hospitals or in public sector.
Officials said that many junior consultants received more fee than the senior ones while the rates for laboratory investigations also varied from one centre to another. Most people complained of high fee for dengue and Covid-19 tests in private sector as the charges ranged from Rs2, 000 to Rs6,000, they said.
They said that some four months ago, the department formed another committee with additional secretary health, director-general health and representatives of HCC as members to pave way for setting up a body for fixing charges of the diagnostic outlets and fee structure for the doctors in accordance with their qualification and experience.
“There is no legal mechanism in health department to fix fee and rates. The committee may recommend amendments to HCC law through provincial assembly authorising it to fix fee structure in private centres,” said officials.
They said that the Mutahidda Majlis-i-Amal government had notified a fee structure for doctors in 2008 which was not implemented.
They said that a notification by health department regarding charges would be resisted by owners of private health facilities and they would likely get relief from the courts in case of action. However, an amendment through provincial assembly was required, they said. “HCC has already compiled data of all the hospitals in public and private sectors,” they added.

On Saturday, a gang of robbers entered the house PML-N Senator Nuzhat Sadiq at F-10/1 and took away cash and valuables worth Rs4.7. 
After the incident, Inspector General of Police Qazi Jamilur Rehman and Deputy Inspector General of Police Afzal Ahmed Kausar visited the Shalimar police station, cheeked the record and suspended the SHO, said the police.
The IGP also removed the SDPO and directed him to report to the Central Police Office.
Senior police officials said a zonal in-charge was also served with a displeasure letter over different issues, including holding an open kutchery on a premise owned by a land grabber. 
The officials said the practice of appointing junior officers on senior posts was one of the reasons behind the increase of crime. 
Sub-inspectors are appointed as SHOs despite the availability of 53 inspectors in the capital. Likewise, grade-18 officers (SPs) are also appointed on the post of grade-19 (SSPs), they added.
Early this month, the SHOs of six police stations were removed over their poor performance and misconduct. Four of the SHOs were suspended over misconduct and bad reputation, including for allegedly assisting land grabbers.
When contacted for comments, IGP Qazi Jamilur Rehman said Additional Superintendent of Police Farhat Abbas Kazmi would respond on his behalf. 
Mr Kazmi said there were some issues, including a robbery at the house of the senator, which resulted in the removal of the SHO Shalimar and the SDPO of the circle.
It is also a prerogative of the IGP to appoint officers on any posts, he said, adding there was a policy to appoint competent and capable officers as SHOs and SSPs.
Junior ranking officers work hard on senior posts and show good performance compared to officers of senior ranks, Mr Kazmi said.
About the zonal in-charge, he said displeasure was already issued to him. Recently, five open kutcheries were conducted by him, including one at a house of a man, he added.

15,Allegations against ex-CJP create doubts about 2018 polls: ANP,ANP central general secretary Mian Iftikhar Hussain urges institutions to follow the Constitution.,"PESHAWAR: Awami National Party has said all state institutions should remain within constitutional framework to avoid controversies.
Addressing a press conference at Bacha Khan Markaz here on Monday, ANP central general secretary Mian Iftikhar Hussain said that the allegations levelled against former chief justice of Pakistan were of serious nature. He added that the allegations created doubts about the transparency of 2018 general elections.
He said that Constitution had defined role of all institutions and those violating the rules were weakening the foundation of the country. He said that keeping in view the allegations against the former CJP, the sitting prime minister could not be called ‘Sadiq’ and ‘Ameen’.
The ANP leader said the audio recording had proved that Imran Khan had come to power through rigged elections. He said that people held judiciary in high esteem but some controversies caused damage to its status.

Iftikhar urges institutions to follow Constitution 

Mr Hussain alleged that establishment was playing active role against the opposition parties. He said the opposition lawmakers were asked to avoid attending the joint session of parliament to pave way for making legislation as per desires of the rulers.
He also showed concerns over increase in the prices of daily use commodities including petroleum products, natural gas, LPG, wheat flour, cooking oil and other essential items. He said that government had nothing to do with welfare of poor as it was following the dictations of International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Referring to a strike call by owners of petrol pumps from November 25, the ANP leader said that foreign loans had led to unprecedented inflation, which made life of people miserable. He said that despite tall claims, the federal government badly failed to provide any financial relief to common people.
Mr Hussain also expressed his reservations about the process of local government elections, saying that the rulers were unable to face the voters so they were not in favour of holding the polls. However, he said that his party was fully prepared to contest the elections and prove its strength.
On the occasion, a former senior activist of Jamaat-i-Islami in Dir Abdur Rehman announced joining ANP. ANP lawmaker from Dir Lower Haji Bahadur Khan was also present on the occasion.
