0,Heirs of Mehran Town factory fire victims accept blood money,Court grants bail to owners and four employees.,"KARACHI: A district and sessions judge on Monday granted bail to interned owners and four officials of a Mehran Town factory after they reached an out-of-court settlement with families of 16 workers, who died in a fire in the industrial unit in August, against payment of around Rs67,200,000 diyat (blood money).
The fire allegedly caused by an electric short-circuit had engulfed the industrial unit, BM Luggage, on Aug 27 killing the 16 workers.
Factory’s owner Hassan Meetha alias Ali Meetha, its building’s owner Faisal Tariq, manager Syed Imran Ali Zaidi, supervisors Zafar and Rehan and watchman Syed Zarin have been booked for their alleged involvement in the incident.
Police had arrested the watchman and later arrested Meetha, Tariq and Zaidi after the court revoked their interim pre-arrest bail on Aug 30.

Court grants bail to owners and four employees

Later, they moved applications seeking grant of post-arrest bail and the District and Sessions Judge (East) Khalid Hussain Shahani had reserved his order on the bail pleas on Oct 19.
While pronouncing the order on Monday, the court allowed the pleas in view of an out-of-court settlement reached by the applicants with the legal heirs of the 16 deceased factory workers.
According to the terms and conditions of the agreement, both the factory owners would pay Rs4.2 million to legal heirs of each victim. Meetha will contribute 60 per cent of the total amount while Tariq would pay remaining 40pc.
Initially, the factory owners handed over cheques for Rs1m to each family of the victims. They also agreed to pay the remaining amount of Rs3.2m to each family in instalments after every three month.
The court granted each applicant bail in the sum of Rs100,000 surety each.
Defence counsel Hassan Sabir said the court directed prison authorities to release the held factory owners and officials forthwith if their custody was not required in any other case.
Earlier, the suspects were produced from prison while the legal heirs of the deceased were also present.
The legal heirs submitted applications supported by their personal affidavits stating that they had agreed to accept diyat offered by the suspects, adding that the agreement in this regard was signed in the office of the Korangi deputy commissioner.
They submitted that they had no objection if the suspects were granted bail and released from prison in the present case.
The matter was fixed for Nov 27 when the factory owners would submit the schedule of the remaining payment to the court.
In the meanwhile, the court also confirmed interim pre-arrest bail granted to six officers of the provincial government, civic agencies and utilities, who were nominated in the case for their alleged ‘negligence’ towards conducting inspections to ensure safety of the workers at their workplace and failure in initiating timely rescue operation.
A case was registered under Sections 322 (manslaughter) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code at the Korangi Industrial Area police station on behalf of the state.

1,Women of power,"A female meter reader from Lyari says she has been given motorcycle riding, self-defence training.","

Meter reader Nazia Murad.

 
KARACHI: She enters a building, heads to the big wall near the entrance with all the electricity meters installed and gets right down to work. Putting on her plastic gloves, she brings out her cell phone. But first she wipes clean with her finger the dust off the screen so that the reading becomes clear for her to photograph. The picture will be printed on your electricity bill.
Meet K-Electric’s female meter reader. She has been around for four years but is being noticed more now as there are several others like her joining the ranks.
Farzana Kausar was 39 when she joined the utility four years ago. ‘Not possible’, ‘You won’t be able to’, ‘It’s not something females do’ and ‘What are people going to say?’ ... She ignored all the negatives to embrace the positives, but only in life. If you speak to her about the positives and negatives at work, she would tell you that it has to do with current. “Current that enters the circuit is positive current and current that is moving away from the circuit is negative.” That is it!
Farzana belongs to Lyari. “Four years ago, our first batch only had four females. I joined because I wanted to do something different,” she told Dawn. “And I did not find any opposition from my people. Lyari is quite enlightened and supportive that way,” she said.

A female meter reader from Lyari says she has been given motorcycle riding, self-defence training

About her training days, she informed that besides receiving training on how to do readings, she was also taught how to ride a motorcycle along with getting some training in martial arts and self-defence. “Well, at the time, there were several threats to KE personnel and I had to learn to defend myself in case of any untoward incident,” she said, adding that that said, nothing like that ever happened to her.
“I am all set now. And seeing me do my work with so much ease and also earn a respectable livelihood has prompted more women to follow me,” she said.
Forty-year-old Nazia Murad is another female meter reader working with the power utility. She was part of the second batch that included nine women.
“After my initial training, which lasted about one week, I went around different areas for meter readings with my seniors for a month. Now I am myself a senior and usually handling work on my own, unless we are taken along and guide a junior. We are taking readings for some 20 days after we are given a schedule from our IT department. Then we go area-wise. A group goes out together and then each reader is given an area to cover following which we regroup and leave,” she said.
She said she is glad that the new meters are not placed that high. “At five feet, we can easily do readings but higher than that would be an issue,” she said. “It is also better that the new meters have been installed outside homes. That way we don’t have to disturb consumers to open gates or doors for us. Though they still come outside for a chat if they notice us and if they are facing some issues with their bills or anything,” she said.
“But consumers are also pleasantly surprised to find a woman doing the meter reading. Some also inquire from us about the joining procedure. We tell them about the required qualifications, etc,” she said, adding that she herself is a graduate and that there is also scope for advancement and promotions in her job.
Nazia said that the third batch of meter readers getting training from KE included four to five women and the most recent fourth batch had as many as 11 women. They are all stationed at various centres in Lyari, Korangi, Landhi, Gulistan-i-Jauhar, Surjani Town, Malir, she said.
Going a step further, the power utility, recently, also started a programme, ‘Roshni Baji’, who are raising awareness about general safety, electrical safety, rain safety, power theft hazards and energy conservation within communities. These women are said to be Pakistan’s first certified women electricians. KE has also inducted five women grid operating officers to take on more challenging roles in the transmission of power.

2,"Fresh deal with IMF to increase inflation, says Miftah",KARACHI: Former finance minister and senior leader of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Miftah Ismail on...,"KARACHI: Former finance minister and senior leader of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Miftah Ismail on Monday warned that the new arrangement of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would bring a “storm of inflation” in the country.
He feared that the growing inflation would push majority of the country’s population towards poverty and it would become tougher to make ends meet.
He also criticised the government policy to empowering the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) granting its governor so much authority that he was now “exploiting his office and behaving like a viceroy”.
Speaking at a press conference here, Mr Ismail said that the current move of the SBP would put immense burden on the national exchequer.
“The current increase in the interest rate from the SBP will raise government expenses by Rs400 billion,” he said. “Similarly, the private sector would face an additional Rs100bn burden.”
“It’s a misconception and deliberate move of the government to mislead people that it is increasing the interest rate to cap inflation. The interest rate has nothing to do with inflation which is increasing due to incompetence of the government and its corrupt practices,” he said.
Accompanied by PML-N leaders Nasiruddin Mahmood, Khawaja Tariq Nazeer and Ali Akbar Gujjar, the former finance minister claimed that the IMF would become directly involved in several matters of governance and the terms and condition the PTI government had agreed for a loan would ultimately force people to pay more for even essential items of daily life.
“So in simple words you [PTI government] have awarded the IMF a status above the state,” he said. “Now the government cannot ask the IMF anything. Before the fresh deal, the consumer price index (CPI) has already increased by 9.2 per cent while the sensitive price index (SPI) has witnessed a jump by 15.2pc and wholesale price index by 21.2pc year on year basis.”
“The CPI says school fees and education expenses have gone up by only 2.2pc and doctor fees and medicine prices have gone up by 8pc. The 15.2pc hike in SPI results in price hike as flour is now available at Rs60 a kilo, mutton and beef at Rs 1,132 and Rs 558 per kg, respectively,” he said.

3,"No headway in fixing of official milk price, SHC told",KARACHI: City administration on Monday informed the Sindh High Court that it had so far unable to fix the official...,"KARACHI: City administration on Monday informed the Sindh High Court that it had so far unable to fix the official price of fresh milk as meetings were under way with stakeholders.
An additional commissioner appeared in court on behalf of the Karachi commissioner and submitted that negotiations with all stakeholders were in the final phase and another meeting was scheduled for Nov 24 (tomorrow).
The bench directed the commissioner to fix the milk price within four weeks and sought a compliance report.
When a two-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Ahmed Ali M. Shaikh took up a petition for hearing about the price and quality of milk, additional commissioner filed a compliance report on behalf of the commissioner.
It was stated in the report that various meetings had been taken place in the office of the commissioner to fix a rational and justified price of milk and a committee had also been constituted to assess and analyse the cost of production of milk.
“The commissioner office has been negotiating with all stakeholders and is in the final phase to finalise milk price in local limits of Karachi division and for that another meeting is scheduled on Nov 24,” it maintained.
The report further stated that district administration had imposed fine against 2,310 profiteers and collected Rs11,918,500.
In September, a division bench of SHC had directed the commissioner to sit together with officials of the Sindh Food Authority and representatives of milk associations and chalk out a formula to ensure the quality of fresh milk as well as its sell at official price. The court also sought a proper statement from the commissioner containing guidelines approved by the meeting.
The bench had also said that out of box steps be taken in collaboration with representatives of milk association to ensure quality and price of milk.
However, the commissioner in its report filed last month submitted that the price of fresh milk could not be fixed and all meetings remained unproductive due to antagonism, inflexibility and rigidity of retailers, wholesaler and dairy farmers associations. He added that the next meeting was scheduled to be held on Oct 28 to determine and fix the rational and judicious price of fresh milk.
It was submitted in the petition that the official price of per litre fresh milk was fixed at Rs94 in the metropolis in 2018, but it was being sold at around Rs140 per litre in different parts of the city in violation of the notified rates and court orders.

DG Dr Mohammad Juman Bahoto told this correspondent that the inquiry committee was to be headed by Dr Nazeer Rind of his office and three senior doctors would assist him as members of the committee.
Dr Nazeer Rind said the committee had already started probe by recording statements of employees at the DHO office, members of general public and employees of health department. The inquiry would be carried out impartially, he said.
EPI Sindh project director Dr Irshad Memon warned if the DHO office was found involved in the embezzlement of funds for measles programme, action would be recommended to the minister and secretary of health.
Meanwhile, many teams failed to reach remote areas of Dadu district to vaccine children against the disease. An estimated number of 21,000 children in Sado-Bado, Gorakh hills, Karo Jabal, Pipra Sar, Nai Gaaj, Mado, Gozo, Fareedabad and Shah Godrio areas were not administered the vaccine and 10,000 children in Kachho area were deprived of the vaccine.
Sources said that as soon as funds for the WHO-sponsored vaccine programme that was to run from Nov 15 to 27 to vaccinate 550,000 children in 52 union councils of the district arrived they were withdrawn by DHO office, seriously affecting the entire exercise.
Several complaints against the DHO were submitted to National Accountability Bureau and Anti Corruption Establishment police, said the sources.
Raja Rafiq Ahmed Panhwar, vice president of Pakistan Paramedical Staff Association’s Sindh chapter, complained that WHO had released Rs6,000 each for field teams for refreshments and fuel and there were six to nine teams working in each union council.
But the DHO Shaikh released only Rs15,000 per union council and embezzled the rest of the amount, he said. If vaccinators and dispensers were not given the actual amount, they would boycott the drive, he warned.
DHO Shaikh contended Rs15,000 had been released to teams in the first phase, the remaining amount would be given to them in the second phase. There were total 555 teams working in 52 union councils in the district since Nov 15 to vaccinate 550,000 children, he said.
Ghulam Qadir Brohi, a resident of Sado Bado area, said that vaccinators had not visited his village to administer vaccines to at least 300 children. The drive had definitely suffered hiccups after the DHO office allegedly swallowed up the budget for measles programme, he said.
Ahmed Khan of Karo Jabal area complained that 20,000 children in mountainous areas were deprived of the vaccine as the teams failed to reach them. Despite sending several complaints to secretary and DG Health Sindh action was not taken against the corrupt DHO, he said, adding around 10,000 children were not vaccinated against measles in Kachho area as well.

7,"Protests held in many towns of Sindh against criminal assault, murder of Hindu schoolboy",The boy’s body with torture marks was found dumped at a desolate place in Babarloi town of Khairpur district on Friday.,"SUKKUR: Members of the Hindu community, along with civil society and rights activists, held protest demonstrations in many cities and towns of Sindh on Monday over the criminal assault and murder of Sukkur’s St Mary’s High School student, Kahna, 10, son of Pritam Kumar.
The boy’s body with torture marks was found dumped at a desolate place in Babarloi town of Khairpur district on Friday.
The incident took the social media by storm and ultimately triggered protests by the Hindu community and civil society organisations in many towns of Sukkur, Khairpur, Jacobabad, Kandhkot-Kashmore, Shikarpur and Ghotki districts on Monday.
The bereaved family and other protesters held a big demonstration at Babarloi by-pass and blocked the road for several hours. A police team led by Khairpur SSP tried to persuade them to clear the road but in vain. A Rangers team also visited the venue of protest and asked people to disperse but it also failed in their attempt till late in the evening.
Mr Kumar, the slain boy’s father, told the SSP that he knew that the alleged rapists and killers, Inam Shah and Mudassir Shah, had already been arrested but they were not being treated as criminals due to their political clout. “They are enjoying all undue facilities at the behest of certain influential figures instead of being locked up and interrogated,” Mr Kumar claimed. He said he also knew that Inam Shah himself belonged to an influential family whose members were government and judicial functionaries.
In Kandhkot, a large number of Hindu community members and activists of different political parties and nationalist groups gathered outside the local press club and raised slogans against killers and the area police. They condemned that 10-year-old Kahna was subjected to criminal assault before he was throttled to death on a day when the world was observing Universal Children’s Day.
Speaking to the participants, Santosh Kumar Agarwal, Daleep Kumar Thakur, Raja Gopi Chand, Sikandar Ali Shah, Sajjad Brohi and others said that cases of child abuse had registered an increase in the country. They urged the judiciary to sentence culprits of criminal assault and murder of children to death. They demanded instant justice to the family of Kahna in order to bring an immediate end to such incidents.
“We will extend our protest drive to other parts of Sindh if Kahna’s killers were not taken to task,” said Ghayal Sindhi and Nazir Soomro, adding that both the arrested men be treated as suspects of criminal assault and murder.
In Jacobabad, the local Hindi Punchayat took out a procession and held a protest demonstration at the Shaheed Allah Bux Park to demand justice to Kahna’s family.
Speaking to the media, Punchayat leaders said that certain influential figures were trying to protect the suspects and making efforts to persuade the bereaved family to agree on an out-of-court settlement.
“We will not allow this to happen,” they declared, saying that no one could be given a licence to kill or subject any person to rape.
Similar protests were held in different towns of Ghotki and Shikarpur districts to demand exemplary punishment to culprits of child abuse and murder.

NFM technical consultative committee’s chairman Dr Kaleemullah Lashari led the experts’ team, including Dr Michael Jansen and others and informed them about the conservation work. The experts inspected DKG Area, HR Area and L Area.
Dr Jansen collected information and evidence regarding ongoing conservation work at HR Area, L Area to guide experts busy in the conservation work on the second and concluding day of the team’s visit.
Ihsan Abbasi (curator) and Naveed Sangah briefed the experts on the conservation work and said that all record at the museum which had been kept since 1960-1965 had been digitalised.
Director general of antiquities and archeology Sindh, Manzoor Ahmed Kanasro, who was also coordinator of the UNESCO and NFM committee, said that record had been completely documented and fumigation had been carried out. After fumigation with chemical, the record and antiques had become safe for 10 to 15 years, he said.
He said that well-developed street grids and extensive drainage system indicated that the inhabitants of Mohen Jo Daro were highly skilled in technology of water control. When the remains of the city were unearthed archaeologists believed they had discovered an important city of an ancient civilisation, dating back to 2600 BCE, he said.
Dr Jansen said that wealth and icons of the towns were also evident in the architecture of the city, carnelian and gold beads as well as baked bricks. A watergated pool called good bath stood on a dirt mound and was enclosed with baked brick walls, the nearest building being a temple, he said, adding wells were found throughout the city and each home had a bath area and drainage system.
Dr Lashari said that efforts continued to conserve all remains of Mohen Jo Daro, a very important of the civilisation of Sindh, which was spread over about 250 acres on a mountain.

Women face different restrictions here ... in order to have courage to speak, one should learn to become a bold author.
She was speaking at the launching ceremony of a book Kallo, a short story authored by Samina Nazeer, at the Khanabadosh Writers Cafe here on Sunday evening.
Ms Shah said that this city (Hyderabad) and Hyderabad Deccan (India) faced similar conditions. The former remained under the influence of nawabs and the latter under sardars and jagirdars. She pointed out that Raja Tabbasum, a young author, exposed nawabs of Hyderabad Deccan. “Those who remain silent would always face troubles and those who speak always remain fearless,” she remarked.
She said Urdu literature lacked women authors. She noted that Samina Nazeer had written on human’s internal sentiments. Readers of this book would be able to speak and find new dimensions, she said.
Ms Shah also observed that Sindhi literature did not produce short stories like Kallo and even in Urdu, this kind of work had been produced after a long gap. “Sindhi literature is losing spirit for producing bold writings,” she noted.
She said Samina Nazeer’s book should be translated into Sindhi to enable Sindhi writers produce literature with boldness.
Samina Nazeer felt that women across the world faced similar conditions but loneliness, deprivation and dreams were a separate subject. She described Kallo as her creative work that became expression of sentiments.
“Writers here in Pakistan have been silenced or they prefer to stay silence,” she observed.
She said that when she returned Pakistan after 18 years, she learnt about a mystic Pakistan “but it appears that it leaves a lot to be desired ... a real mystic society is still far away”.
Writing short stories demanded feeling the ‘pain’, she said.
She pointed out that today people preferred buying mobile phones over books. “Still, book has its own place,” she said.
Writer and poet Atiya Dawood said that the book had many characters of woman’s distress. Not only pain, but there were many other sentences that touched the readers, she said.

12,Sindh Assembly asks Centre to halt construction of two canals,"PTI boycotts proceedings; MQM-P, GDA support govt resolution.","KARACHI: Amid Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s boycott, the Sindh Assembly on Monday strongly condemned the federal government for constructing Jalalpur Canal and Greater Thal Canal’s Phase-II, passing a resolution that was also fully supported by two other major opposition parties — the Grand Democratic Alliance and Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan.
Irrigation Minister Jam Khan Shoro, who tabled the resolution, said that the Sindh’s water share had continuously been cut by the Centre.
Speaking on the resolution, lawmakers of ruling Pakistan Peoples Party and opposition GDA and MQM-P expressed grave concerns over the construction of the two canals and demanded immediate halting of the process in the larger interest of the province’s people.
At the outset of the proceedings, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf members lodged a strong protest when Opposition Leader Haleem Adil Shaikh was not allowed by Deputy Speaker Rehana Leghari to speak before Question Hour.

PTI boycotts proceedings; MQM-P, GDA support govt resolution

The opposition members gathered in front of the Speaker’s rostrum, chanting anti-government slogans and tearing up copies of agenda as the chair repeatedly assured the agitating members that they would be allowed to speak after completion of the business.
And when the chair allowed the irrigation minister to move the resolution after completion of Question Hour, PTI lawmakers rose to protest against the move and then boycotted the proceedings, left the house and did not return.
Minister Shoro said that water dispute between Sindh and Punjab was 100-year old, recalling that commissions were established in 1937 and 1945 to settle the dispute. In 1991, another water accord was reached to which the PPP had severe reservations but it accepted it in the greater national interest, he said.
He said that the provincial government had taken up the matter of short supply of water to the province at the Council of Common Interest (CCI) and then the attorney general accepted the Sindh’s stance. “The sea has invaded 3.2 million acres of Sindh’s land. On the one hand, they (federal government) decry shortage of water, but on the other hand, it is establishing a new canal,” he deplored, adding that this was not acceptable to Sindh at any cost.
The resolution said: “This house expresses grave concerns over the construction of Jalalpur Canal and Chaubara Branch Canal Project Greater Thal Canal (Phase-II).”
It said that the Sindh Assembly in its sitting held in Feb 2003 and June 2003 had also passed the resolutions unanimously along with the opposition parties against the construction of Greater Thal Canal and termed its construction against the interests of the people of Sindh.
“In view of this situation, this house condemns this act of federal government in compliance to the Punjab government’s controversial projects despite the Sindh government forwarding their objections on legal grounds being against the constitutional provision under Water Apportionment Accord 1991 and the IRSA Act 1992. This House resolves that the process and construction of above project must be stopped immediately in the best interest of people of Sindh,” the resolution said.
MQM-P’s token walkout
MQM-P’s parliamentary party leader Kanwar Naveed Jameel said that his party fully supported the resolution but would also register its protest over ‘injustices’ being meted out to urban areas of the province.
He said that despite being a coalition partner in the federal government, the MQM-P had always stood by the Sindh government for the rights of the province.
He said that the Sindh government always talked about water share of the province but it didn’t increase even a drop of water for Karachi in the last 14 years. Mr Jameel said that provision of water was the prime responsibility of the provincial government yet the federal government was funding the K-IV water project.
“Despite your (Sindh government) injustices with urban areas, the MQM-P always supported the provincial government for its right,” he said before announcing a boycott of the proceedings against the ‘injustices’.
Sharjeel Inam Memon, who was presiding over the session, requested the MQM-P not to boycott the proceedings and suggested the government to hold a meeting to listen to the party’s grievances.
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Mukesh Kumar Chawla assured that he along with other ministers Saeed Ghani and Nasir Hussain Shah would have a meeting with the MQM-P after which the latter staged only a token walkout and came back immediately.
PPP’s Syed Qaim Ali Shah, Imdad Pitafi, Riaz Hussain Sheerazi; MQM-P’s Muhammad Hussain Khan and GDA’s Nand Kumar also spoke on the resolution.
The house also adopted a unanimous resolution moved by Nand Kumar of the GDA to pay tribute to Baba Guru Nanak on his birthday.
The house was adjourned to Wednesday.

13,FIA finds airport land’s demarcation maps forged several times,KARACHI: The demarcation map of the Jinnah International Airport’s land was made several times in connivance with...,"KARACHI: The demarcation map of the Jinnah International Airport’s land was made several times in connivance with revenue and Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) officials with mala fide intentions of encroachment, a Federal Investiga­tion Agency’s (FIA) investigation revealed on Monday.
The FIA also made a startling disclosure that the record of the summary containing the approval note of the then chief minister in 1992 was not available regarding the transaction of four acres of the land while a bogus summary was moved for regularising another five acres.
Besides, the land transactions were carried out by the officials concerned despite a complete ban on further transaction of the state land imposed by the Supreme Court in 2012, according to officials’ accounts and papers reviewed by Dawn.
Two FIRs have been registered by the FIA’s corporate crime circle about illegal allotment and occupation of CAA’s nine acres, and four suspects including three CAA officials and one private person have been arrested.
Over 30 suspects have been nominated in both cases including officials of the Board of Revenue, CAA, deputy commissioners, assistant commissioners and private persons namely Haleem Siddiqi, Arslan Khalid, Khalid Yusufi, Mushtaq Ahmed and others.
‘Fabricated’ maps
The land acquisition process of the Karachi airport in Malir (formerly East) district was initiated in 1976, but it was allocated to the CAA in 1983, containing 78 acres of private persons and 209 acres of state land.
The land demarcation maps prepared in 1983, 1995, 2000, 2008, 2012, 2019 and 2019 revealed that the revenue officials with mala fide intentions shifted the boundaries of CAA’s land to pave the way for illegally creating new survey numbers and then relocating those numbers to usurp four acres.
Zareen Gul Durrani, the then estate officer at the Jinnah International Airport, Jahanzeb Khan and Mohammed Ali, the then senior surveyors at the airport, have signed the said fabricated demarcation maps and also issued a no-objection certificate without concurrence from the law officer and approval from the competent authority.
The FIA believes that 23 accused persons — including CAA, revenue officials, the then deputy commissioner Malir and others — seemed to have committed criminal misconduct to misappropriate government property.
About the alleged illegal occupation of five other acres lands of the airport, the FIA probe said that retired captain Haleem Siddiqui claimed that he had purchased the said land from Ayesha Mohammed Khan in 1993 for his company Epic Air Pvt. Ltd and the same was regularised by the land utilisation department.
FIA records reveal that Ms Ayesha purchased 62 acres of land in deh Narathar in district West Karachi, while the LU was given 84 acres in lieu of 62 acres.
However, the FIA said the record file of the LU showed that the ‘outward number’ did not appear in the summary for the Sindh’s chief minister submitted by late Ghulam Abbas Soomro, the then secretary LU, to this effect.
“The officers of the LU department confirmed in their statements that without any outward number, the summary seems to be fake/bogus/suspicious,” according to the FIA investigation.
The FIA believed that 11 accused, including officials and Haleem Siddiqui, in collusion, connivance and abetment with each other committed acts of criminal misconduct to misappropriate government property for wrongful gain.
