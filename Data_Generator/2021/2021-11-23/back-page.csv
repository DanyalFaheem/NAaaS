0,Telenor looking for merger opportunities in Pakistan: CEO,Four cellular firms operating in country with a total of 187 million subscribers.,"KARACHI: Telenor Group is looking for “merger opportunities” in Pakistan, news agency Reuters quoted on Monday the CEO of the Norwegian telecom operator as saying.
“Telenor will continue to look for merger opportunities in Asia, including in Pakistan and on a regional basis,” said Sigve Brekke, CEO of Telenor Group, which runs telecom business in nine markets across Europe and Asia.
He made the comment after announcing his company’s plan to merge its telecom unit in Thailand with a local entity in an $8.6 billion deal.
There are four cellular networks in the country with a total of 187 million subscribers. Jazz is the largest network with a 38.4 per cent market share, followed by Telenor (26.4pc), Zong (22.2pc) and Ufone (12.1pc).

Four cellular firms operating in country with a total of 187 million subscribers

Speaking to Dawn, Pak-Kuwait Investment Company’s head of research Samiullah Tariq said the European company was looking for consolidation in Pakistan because the telecom market is becoming saturated here.
“It’s become a stable business now. There’s not much growth,” he said, emphasising that a possible merger will bring efficiency and bottom-line improvement to the merged entity.
“The consumer may suffer because of the reduced competition in the telecom sector. But the merged entity will have more space on its balance sheet to invest in technology and infrastructure as the 5G rollout is expected in 2022-23,” he added.
Both Jazz and Telenor are owned by foreign holding companies. As such, they don’t publish the net profit figures for their Pakistan operations.
But the latest quarterly accounts released by its holding company show the Pakistan business of Telenor Group posted a year-on-year increase of 12.9pc in operating profit for July-September. Its total revenue increased 3.2pc over the same period. The company’s subscriber base stood at 48.9m at the end of September, up 6pc from a year ago.
However, its average revenue per user (ARPU), a key performance benchmark for cellular companies, declined 10pc year-on-year in July-September.
In an interview with Dawn last year, Telenor Pakistan CEO Irfan Wahab Khan had said that raising the number of phone subscribers in Pakistan was “challenging” because of high and discriminatory tax rates. He had also claimed that the official teledensity percentage — which was 79pc at that time and now hovers around 85pc — was “misleading” because many phone users carried multiple SIMs.
He told Dawn that a market like Pakistan should not have more than three cellular networks. Ensuring geographical coverage consumed resources and the resulting intense competition reduced profitability, he said.
Ufone, which is the smallest telecom player, is also looking for a merger with another telecom operator, according to reports in the financial press. Should Telenor merge its operations with Ufone, the combined entity will have almost as many subscribers as the current market leader Jazz.
The telecom industry underwent the first round of consolidation about five years ago when the shareholders of Warid signed a share-swap agreement with Mobilink (now Jazz) for a 15pc stake in the merged entity.
Earlier this month, MCB Bank Ltd showed interest in purchasing the entire 55pc stake in Telenor Microfinance Bank, which the Telenor Group currently owns in the Pakistani micro-lender.

1,Forensic firm urges permission to share tape scandal’s result,"FactFocus, which shared the audio clip of conversation allegedly involving former CJP Saqib Nisar, had mentioned firm in report.","WASHINGTON: Garret Discovery, a US firm which examined a tape attributed to former chief justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar, told Dawn on Monday it “did perform work” for a website called FactFocus but refused to share details.
In the audio clip, which has not been verified by Dawn, a voice, allegedly of the former chief justice, can be heard saying: “Let me be a little blunt about it. Unfortunately, here it is the institutions that dictate judgements. In this case, we will have to punish Mian Saheb (Nawaz Sharif). [I] have been told ‘we have to bring Khan Saheb’ (Imran Khan) [into power].” Then, he adds, “Punishment will have to be given.”
FactFocus also carried a statement on its site, saying that it got the audio clip checked by Garret Disco­very, a firm which identifies itself as “computer, mobile, video and audio forensic experts”.
FactFocus said: “Garret Discovery has a team of leading experts who have a long experience of analysing and presenting evidence and testifying before courts in the US. The firm’s analysis report certifies the integrity of the audio file and states that ‘this audio has not been edited in any way’.”
In a chat with a Garret Discovery representative, Dawn pointed out that the firm has been mentioned in a story about a former Pakistani chief justice.
“A website called FactFocus did this story, based on a taped conversation between the chief justice and someone else. The website claims that your firm performed forensics on the tape and determined that it has not been edited or tampered with. So, we need your version.”
“We did perform work for FactFocus. As part of our standard agreement, we have a confidentiality clause that prohibits us from speaking about the scope of work or work we performed,” the representative responded.
“We have no problem releasing details as long as our client signs an agreement allowing us to do so. Please contact FactFocus with any inquiries as to the work we performed and discuss with them any release of information. We will not comment anymore on this issue until that time.”
When Dawn asked Fact­Focus if Garret Discovery also determined this was “a genuine audio tape of a conversation between two persons,” they said they never made any claim about the authenticity of the conversation. “The forensic was about the tape, not who the two persons were. Although, the first voice is that of Mr Nisar, we don’t know the second person.”

2,Maryam accused of delaying tactics after counsel skips IHC hearing,Information minister blames Maryam for seeking 16 adjournments since August 2018 when she filed an appeal in the case.,"ISLAMABAD: After the newly-engaged counsel for the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader expressed his inability to appear before the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday (tomorrow) in the hearing of appeals of Maryam Nawaz and her husband retired Capt Mohammad Safdar, the government took this as an opportunity to blame the appellant for adopting delaying tactics.
Advocate Irfan Qadir, who was engaged by Ms Nawaz last month, filed an application before the IHC seeking hearing on any other date except Nov 24 as he was supposed to appear before the Supreme Court.
The application signed by Advocate Qadir stated: “At the conclusion of hearing on Nov 17, 2021, the titled case was adjourned to Nov 24…that immediately thereafter the Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan issued a cause list according to which two cases of the undersigned counsel have been fixed before the bench no. 2 at the principal seat of the apex court on the same date…as such it would not be possible for the undersigned to be present before this Honorable Court on Nov 24.”
Subsequently, Irfan Qadir requested the court that “the case may graciously be adjourned to any other date convenient to this Honorable Court”.
It is a routine practice that when a lawyer is supposed to appear before the Supreme Court, he seeks adjournment in cases fixed for hearing before the high courts or trial courts on the same date.
However, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry blamed Ms Nawaz for seeking 16 adjournments since August 2018 when she filed an appeal before the IHC against her conviction in the Avenfield apartment reference.
“16th application to seek adjournment from Maryam Nawaz, and organised propaganda against judiciary and armed forces, hence these people are not less than Sicilian Mafia,” the minister tweeted.

 



 
The government has been accusing the PML-N of launching a campaign against the judiciary after the former chief judge of Gilgit-Baltistan, in an affidavit, accused the former Supreme Court chief justice Saqib Nisar of issuing instructions to delay the release of Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz till the conclusion of the 2018 general election.
The government was also critical of the leaked audio of Justice Nisar in which he was allegedly discussing the conviction of Mr Sharif and his daughter.
A few days before the elections in 2018, the accountability judge of Islamabad, who is working under the supervision of an apex court judge, convicted the Sharif family in the Avenfield apartment reference on July 6.
The Sharif family filed appeals against its conviction before the IHC in the second week of August 2018.

3,Taliban ban TV shows featuring women actors,Wearing hijab now mandatory for female TV anchors,"KABUL: The Taliban regime late on Sunday issued a new “religious guideline” that calls on the country’s television channels to stop showing dramas and soap operas featuring women actors.
In the first such directive to Afghan media issued by the Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, the Taliban also called on women television journalists to wear “Islamic hijabs” while presenting their reports.
And the ministry asked the channels not to air films or programmes in which the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) or other revered figures are shown. It called for banning films or programmes that were against Islamic and Afghan values.
“These are not rules but a religious guideline,” ministry spokesman Hakif Mohajir said.

Wearing hijab now mandatory for female TV anchors

The new directive was widely circulated on social media networks.
Despite insisting they will rule more moderately this time around, the Taliban have already introduced rules for what women can wear at university, and beaten and harassed several Afghan journalists despite promising to uphold press freedoms.
The guideline for TV networks comes after two decades of explosive growth for independent Afghan media under the western-backed governments that ruled the country until August 15, when the Taliban regained power.
Dozens of television channels and radio stations were set up with western assistance and private investment soon after the Taliban were toppled in 2001.
During the past 20 years, Afghan television channels offered a wide range of programmes — from an ‘American Idol’ style singing competition to music videos, along with several Turkish and Indian soap operas.
When the Taliban previously ruled from 1996 to 2001, there was no Afghan media to speak of — they banned television, movies and most other forms of entertainment, deeming it immoral.
People caught watching television faced punishment, including having their set smashed. Ownership of a video player could lead to a public lashing.
There was only one radio station, Voice of Sharia, that broadcast propaganda and Islamic programming.

4,SHC told to explain appointments made ‘without adherence to rules’,Orders SHC registrar to specify number of posts filled under different processes and also identify the sanctioning authorities.,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court summoned the Sindh High Court’s (SHC) registrar on Monday to explain how many posts of para-legal staff had been filled since 2017 by relaxing the rules.
“It appears that the appointment of para-legal staff was carried out without strict adherence to the appointment rules (Sindh Judicial Service Rules),” observed Justice Umar Ata Bandial, who headed a three-judge bench.
The bench had taken up a petition moved by Ghulam Sarwar Qureshi through his counsel, Khawaja Shamsul Islam. The petitioner sought a declaration from the apex court that all appointments made in the Sindh High Court since 2017, including those of civil judges and additional district judges in lower courts across the province, were ab initio illegal, unconstitutional and had no legal effect.
The Supreme Court ordered Abdul Razzak, the SHC registrar, to appear before it on Dec 2 with record detailing the appointment of para-legal staff since 2017.
The registrar was also asked to specify the number of posts filled under different processes and also identify the sanctioning authorities.
The apex court expressed surprise that it was provided a copy of a report prepared by the SHC registrar about the allegations levelled by the petitioner under a sealed cover, but no copy was provided to the petitioner’s counsel.
The bench said the report needed to be read carefully because even a cursory glance suggested that the appointment of para-legal staff was undertaken by relaxing rules. The condition of domicile was relaxed in some cases on the request of the district judges concerned.
The court noted that the letters written by different district judges seeking relaxation of rules were verbatim copies and carried the same date in July 2017.
An initial review further revealed that for the post of clerks in the high court, the age limit was relaxed by as many as five years and six months. In one case six persons appeared to be related to Zulfikar Sheikh – a relative of the incumbent Chief Justice of the SHC, the order said.
In another case, the age limit was relaxed by 12 years for Mohammad Afzal for the job of bailiff, the order said. It was alleged during the hearing that the individual was related to “decision-makers”.
“The registrar is required to answer the allegations raised in the petition,” the court said. It appears that nine stenographers were appointed in Karachi-West and only one of them hailed from that city, the bench observed.
Moreover, six junior clerks were appointed after easing the age limit _ in one case the limit was relaxed by four years and six months.
About the appointment of judicial officers under the administrative control of Sindh High Court, the Supreme Court observed that in this case the selection criterion was followed strictly, recalling that 49 out of 826 candidates were picked after the first test and after further scrutiny only four were shortlisted. Only one of them was finally selected.
In the petition a directive was sought for the constitution of a joint investigation committee (JIT) to scrutinise the record of appointments made in the Sindh High Court as well as in the province’s lower judiciary.
After the JIT report, the petitioner added, directives should be given to initiate an inquiry against the registrar, the SHC chief justice and all the district judges for alleged violation of rules.
The petition had also sought a directive that the registrar, the chief justice and the law ministry of Sindh produce the entire record of appointments in the SHC from 2017 till date.
The apex court should order the authorities concerned to denotify all such appointments, the petitioner pleaded.
