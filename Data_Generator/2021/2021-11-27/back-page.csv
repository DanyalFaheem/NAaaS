0,Shehbaz Sharif urges chief election commissioner to move court against Daska poll ‘culprits’,"Calls for further probe to identify ‘behind-the-scene directors’ of fraud at federal, provincial levels.","LAHORE: Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly, Shehbaz Sharif, has written a letter to the chief election commissioner (CEC) requesting him to move court against all characters behind Daska by-poll fraud involving overnight disappearance of about 20 presiding officers. 
In the letter to CEC Sikandar Sultan Raja, the PML-N president has called for legal action against the officers and staff involved in the scandal, besides exposing those in the federal and provincial governments responsible for giving illegal instructions. 
In light of the facts, findings and recommendations of two investigation reports (of the election commission), Mr Sharif has asked the CEC to file complaints against all election officials performing duties in Daska who have been identified as having committed offences under sections 184, 186, 187 and 188 of the Election Act in the court of law. Moreover, action should be taken against those involved as per sections 167, 175, 174 and 183 of the law, he demanded. 
The opposition leader also suggested that amendments be made to the act, election rules, code of conduct and procedures in consultation with political parties to avoid irregularities like the Daska by-election. 

Calls for further probe to identify ‘behind-the-scene directors’ of fraud at federal, provincial levels  

The letter stated that fact-finding reports have been issued on the NA-75 Daska by-election in which presiding officers, election staff, the Sialkot deputy commissioner (DC) and the district police chief were declared guilty of misconduct and illegal activities. Those involved in the fraud also violated the election process to divert the results in favour of the government. The officers responsible gave illegal orders to the election staff and committed criminal conduct. The reports proved there were continuous meetings of government functionaries with government officials at their residence. 
Mr Sharif said electoral fraud and vote theft had stained the democratic system. He asked the CEC to initiate further probe to identify, fix responsibility on, and file complaints against the persons at the federal and provincial levels (other than those mentioned in the reports) who were “behind-the-scenes directors” of the whole episode and passed illegal instructions to the district functionaries to carry out “nefarious criminal acts”. 
“There is also a need to formulate amendments to the Act/rules/code of conduct/SoPs in consultation with political parties to ensure that the illegalities in the infamous NA-75 (Daska) by-election do not recur.” 
He said both investigation reports contained compelling, indisputable facts which constituted a damning indictment of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s Punjab government over a “pre-meditated and systematic rigging of the by-election”.   
“Overwhelming evidence of such rigging was available immediately after the by-election, which was one of the most controversial by-elections in Pakistan’s history — 20 missing presiding officers, aerial firing to terrorise voters, two persons killed, suspension/deliberate slowing down of voting, bad law and order situation. Both reports have confirmed the widespread view of the PML-N that the illegal events on polling day were pre-planned and executed with the connivance and active collaboration of the district authorities at the behest of the Punjab government,” he claimed. 
He said the main finding of the first report was: official records obtained from various sources, including the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, Intelligence Bureau and police, and statements of presiding officers and other election officials revealed that the by-election was not held in a fair, free and transparent manner. 
“Election officials and other government functionaries were found to be puppets in the hands of their unlawful masters. The report reveals that 20 ‘missing’ presiding officers had concealed facts and manipulated replies, shifting blame to police, however they were clearly guilty of negligence and maladministration and their conduct showed that they were backed by someone. The presiding officers and other officials of the education department were fully involved in jeopardising the fair, free and transparent by-election. The roles of the district returning officer and returning officer were also very poor and irresponsible,” the letter stated. 
It further said one of the key findings of the second report was that the district administration was “in the loop” regarding “undesired and illegal incidents” in the by-election. “The lethargic behaviour of the district police officer (DPO) and senior police officers strengthened the apprehensions that the department was already in the knowledge of what was going on and it allowed things to happen as per planning.” 
It said that the DC and the DPO of Sialkot were found guilty of misconduct. “The [assistant commissioner] Daska not only misused his official position, but tried his level best to jeopardise the election process and alter the results in favour of the government and also gave unlawful directions to the polling personnel, both of which were criminal acts on his part. 
“His (AC) residence became a pivot of unlawful activities where meetings of government functionaries were held regularly, including by an adviser to the chief minister and an officer of the CM’s secretariat. [Deputy superintendents of police] and other police personnel performing election duties were also found to be involved in violations of legal provisions, code of conduct and security plan.” 
The letter said that disclosures made in the reports established election rigging of an unprecedented nature, amounting to subversion of the will of the people, disrespect of the people’s vote, and a stain on the democratic system.  
“The ECP must take immediate, decisive, punitive action against all those responsible, which can serve as a deterrent to such illegalities in the future, not only for election officials but also for all those involved in the electoral process, including behind-the-scenes functionaries of the provincial and federal governments.”

1,Protesters hold demos outside Amazon depots across Europe,Extinction Rebellion says Amazon’s “crimes” include activities which emit more carbon dioxide than a medium-sized country.,"TILBURY: Climate activists targeted 15 Amazon depots across Europe on “Black Friday” and the world’s biggest e-commerce company also faced protests by workers and delivery drivers in Germany, France and Italy. 
Amazon, based in Seattle, is facing criticism from climate activists who say excessive consumption harms the environment while an alliance of trade unions say the company does not pay workers enough nor enough tax to governments. 
“Black Friday epitomises an obsession with overconsumption that is not consistent with a liveable planet,” the Extinction Rebellion group said after blocking 13 Amazon depots across the United Kingdom. 
“Amazon and companies like it have capitalised on our desire for convenience and stoked rampant consumerism at the expense of the natural world,” it said. 
Reporters at an Amazon depot at Tilbury docks in eastern England said protesters had blocked the entrance, meaning no vehicles could enter or exit. The group also said it had blocked Amazon depots in Germany and the Netherlands. 
Banners read: “Black Friday exploits people and planet” and “Infinite growth, finite planet”. 
Extinction Rebellion said Amazon’s “crimes” included activities which emitted more carbon dioxide than a medium sized country, helping fossil fuel companies. 
“We have a large network of sites across the UK and are working to minimise any potential disruption to customers,” said a spokesperson for Amazon, which brought the traditional US Black Friday discount day to Britain in 2010.
Amazon also said it takes its responsibilities “very seriously”.
“That includes our commitment to be net zero carbon by 2040 — 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement — providing excellent pay and benefits in a safe and modern work environment, and supporting the tens of thousands of British small businesses who sell on our store. We know there is always more to do,” it said.
Trade unions across Europe’s biggest economies also called out warehouse workers and delivery drivers to strike against what they said were Amazon’s unfairly low wages and tax payments.
In Germany, the company’s biggest market after the United States, the Verdi union said around 2,500 employees went on strike at Amazon shipping centres in Rheinberg, Koblenz and Graben.
In France, one of the country’s top labour unions, CGT, called for Amazon workers in the country to go on strike. The union coalition also reported a strike in Italy.
“The coalition demands Amazon pays its workers fairly and respects their right to join unions, pays its fair share of taxes and commits to real environmental sustainability,” the “Make Amazon Pay” coalition said in a statement.

2,"New virus variant triggers global alarm, sends stocks tumbling",WHO cautions against hasty travel bans,"LONDON: Authorities around the world reacted with alarm on Friday to a new coronavirus variant found in South Africa, with the EU and Britain among those tightening border controls as researchers sought to establish if the mutation was vaccine-resistant.
Hours after Britain banned flights from South Africa and neighbouring countries and asked travellers returning from there to quarantine, the World Health Organisation (WHO) cautioned against hasty travel bans.
“It’s really important that there are no knee-jerk responses here,” said the WHO’s emergencies director Mike Ryan, praising South Africa’s public health institutions for picking up the new variant of the virus that causes Covid-19.
“Because we’ve seen in the past, the minute that there is any mention of any kind of variation, then everyone is closing borders and restricting travel.” The WHO said it would take weeks to determine how effective vaccines were against the variant.
South Africa’s Health Minister Joe Phaahla called the travel restrictions “unjustified”, though he also said preliminary studies suggested the new variant may be more transmissible.

WHO cautions against hasty travel bans

European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said the EU also aimed to halt air travel from the region. Several other countries including India, Japan and Israel toughened curbs.
“It is now important that all of us in Europe act very swiftly, decisively and united,” von der Leyen said. “All air travel to these countries should be suspended until we have a clearer understanding about the danger posed by this new variant.” In Washington, top US infectious disease official Anthony Fauci said no decision had been made on a possible US travel ban. There was no indication that the variant was in the United States, and it was unclear whether it was resistant to current vaccines, he told CNN.
The news nonetheless pummelled global stocks which plunged 10%, on fears that new restrictions would hit the travel industry and already shaky economies across southern Africa.
Most significant variant
The variant has a spike protein that is dramatically different to the one in the original coronavirus that vaccines are based on, the UK Health Security Agency said, raising fears about how current vaccines will fare.
“As scientists have described, (this is) the most significant variant they’ve encountered to date,” British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told Sky News.
In Geneva the WHO, whose experts on Friday discussed the risks that the variant, called B.1.1.529, presents, warned against travel curbs for now.
It would take several weeks to determine the variant’s transmissibility and the effectiveness of vaccines, WHO spokesperson Christian Lindmeier said, noting that 100 sequences of it had been reported so far.
British health minister Sajid Javid said the sequence of the variant was first uploaded by Hong Kong from someone travelling from South Africa.
“It is highly likely that it has now spread to other countries,” Javid told lawmakers.
South African scientists suspect the sudden spike in infections in the country is linked to the new variant, but it is not clear how far it has spread beyond its borders.
Belgium identified Europe’s first case, adding to those in Botswana, Israel and Hong Kong. Denmark has sequenced all Covid-19 cases and found no sign of the new mutation, Danish health authorities said on Thursday.
Israel imposed a travel ban covering most of Africa.
“We are currently on the verge of a state of emergency,” Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said in a statement. “Our main principle is to act fast, strong and now.” Brazilian health regulator Anvisa recommended that travel be restricted from some African countries, but President Jair Bolsonaro appeared to dismiss such measures.
Bolsonaro has been widely criticised by public health experts for his management of the pandemic, railing against lockdowns and choosing not to get vaccinated. Brazil has the world’s second-highest death toll from the virus, behind only the United States.
The coronavirus has swept the world in the two years since it was first identified in central China, infecting almost 260 million people and killing 5.4 million.
One epidemiologist in Hong Kong said it may be too late to tighten travel curbs against the latest variant.
“Most likely this virus is already in other places. And so if we shut the door now, it’s going to be probably too late,” said Ben Cowling of the University of Hong Kong.
European states had already been expanding booster vaccinations and tightening curbs as the continent battles a fourth Covid-19 wave, with many reporting record daily rises in cases.
Discovery of the new variant comes as Europe and the United States enter winter, with more people gathering indoors in the run-up to Christmas, providing a breeding ground for infection.

3,"Russia mourns death of 46 miners, five rescuers; survivor found",Acting emergencies minister calls survival of medic Alexander Zakovryashin “a miracle” and pays tribute to those who died.,"GRAMOTEINO: Russia on Friday was mourning more than 50 people who died in a Siberian coal mine disaster, though the discovery of a rescue worker presumed dead was being hailed as a miracle.
The accident on Thursday at the Listvyazhnaya mine in the Kemerovo mining region saw smoke fill the site after an apparent gas explosion.
After initially reporting that six rescuers had died during attempts to reach miners, officials said Friday that one had been found alive after spending the night in the mine and was taken to hospital for treatment.
Acting emergencies minister Alexander Chupriyan called the survival of medic Alexander Zakovryashin “a miracle” and paid tribute to those who had died.
“Rescuers, just like miners, did their duty to the end,” he said, and their names “will remain forever in our memory.” News of his survival was a small consolation for a community devastated by the loss of 51 lives, including those of 46 miners, in the worst mining accident in Russia in more than a decade.
Officials said it appeared the accident at the mine had been caused by a methane explosion. Investigators launched probes into possible safety violations and senior managers at the facility were arrested.

4,Pakistanis among hundreds of migrants rescued by Tunisian navy from sea,The navy says the migrants included 13 woman and 93 children.,"TUNIS: The Tunisian navy rescued 487 migrants on Friday from an overloaded boat that ran into difficulty in rough seas in the Mediterranean as they tried to reach Europe. 
The vessel was carrying migrants from Egypt, Syria, Sudan, Pakistan, Ethiopia and the Palestinian territories. The navy said they included 13 woman and 93 children. 
In recent months, several drowning incidents have occurred off Tunisia, with an increase in the frequency of attempted crossings from Tunisia and Libya towards Italy. 
Hundreds of thousands of people have made the perilous Mediterranean crossing in recent years, many of them fleeing conflict and poverty in Africa and the Middle East. 
The migrants were taken to the port of El Kitf in Ben Guerdane.

5,Thousands join global outcry over violence against women,Clashes breaks out during rallies in Mexico and Turkey.,"MEXICO CITY: Thousands of protesters hit the streets of Europe and Latin America on Thursday to demand an end to violence against women, with police in Turkey firing teargas to disperse the demonstrators. 
The rallies took place to mark the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, with thousands marching through Mexico City, Madrid and Barcelona, while others gathered in Paris and London. 
There were also rallies in countries including Chile, Venezuela, Bolivia, Uruguay and Guatemala. 
“They didn’t die. They killed them,” read one of the banners at the march in Mexico, a country where around 10 women are murdered each day. 
Across Latin America and the Caribbean, at least 4,091 women were victims of femicide in 2020, according to the regional commission of the United Nations. 
Tensions flared in Mexico City when a small number of hammer-wielding protesters tried to grab shields from police officers, who repelled them with smoke bombs. 

Clashes breaks out during rallies in Mexico and Turkey

Things also turned ugly in Istanbul as riot police fired tear gas to break up a demonstration by hundreds of protesters urging the government to rejoin an international treaty designed to protect women. 
The Turkish government had abandoned the landmark Istanbul Conven­tion earlier this year on grounds its gender equality principles undermined traditional family values, in a move that angered women campaigners. 
So far this year, 345 women have been killed in Turkey, rights groups say. 
A global scourge
In Spain, where the government has made the fight against domestic violence a national priority, thousands hit the streets of Madrid and Barcelona in a sea of purple flags, while others rallied in Valencia, Seville and other cities around the country. 
In the Spanish capital, marchers wearing purple masks, hats and scarves walked behind a huge banner reading “Enough of male violence against women. Solutions now!” 
“Not all of us are here, the murdered are missing,” they chanted as they marched past the Cibeles fountain and other historic buildings that had been illuminated in purple, holding signs reading “Not even one more death”. 
“On a global level, it remains a scourge and a huge problem,” Leslie Hoguin, a 30-year-old student and actor told AFP.
“It’s high time that patriarchal violence against our bodies, our lives and our decisions came to an end.” Many were fed up of the ongoing abuse faced by women.
“We are sick of the ongoing violence against us which takes many different forms,” said Maria Moran, a 50-year-old civil servant.
“We want to see prostitution abolished and an end to the murders, the abuse and the rapes.” Back in 2004, Spain’s parliament overwhelmingly approved Europe’s first law cracking down on gender-based violence.
“Eradicating sexist violence is a national priority,” tweeted Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, a self-described feminist whose cabinet is dominated by women.
“We will only be a just society when we are done with all kinds of violence against women.” 
Nearly one in three women worldwide has experienced physical or sexual violence, mostly by someone they know, according to UN Women, the United Nations’ organisation for gender equality.
“Violence against women is a global crisis. In all of our own neighborhoods there are women and girls living in danger,” executive director Sima Bahous said in a video message.
