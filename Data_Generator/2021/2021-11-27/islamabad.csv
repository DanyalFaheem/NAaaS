• Minister backs decision, says education ministry will supervise college and higher education
• All 33 colleges placed under administrative control of Federal College of Education
ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of Federal Education has shown its support for the federal government’s plan of placing school education in Islamabad under the administrative control of the yet to be elected mayor while teaching and non-teaching staff are up in arms against the move.
The teaching and non-teaching staff of schools formed an action committee and decided that from Tuesday they would start boycotting classes against the decision, saying placing education under the local government was an anti-education decision.
Speaking to Dawn, Education Minister Shafqat Mahmood supported the ordinance under which the mayor will be the reporting officer of the FDE head. He said his ministry will supervise college and higher education. He said placing school education under the mayor was a good decision.
“Elected mayor, who will get vote of public, should have the right to say in school education affairs and I support this move. As far as college and university education, the ministry of education will supervise it,” the minister said, adding the ministry will play a guiding role for the local government.
According to the ordinance related to the local government promulgated by President Dr Arif Alvi recently, the director general of the Federal Directorate of Education (FDE) will report to the mayor for all purposes of education. Moreover, the head of the FDE shall be appointed with the consent of the mayor.
The local government will be responsible for management of primary, elementary and secondary education facilities.
Meanwhile, two days before approval of theordinance, the ministry of education decided to place all the 33 colleges in Islamabad under the administrative control of the Federal College of Education, H-9, which is a subordinate organisation of the ministry.
Earlier, the FDE was supposed to regulate all the 423 public schools and colleges in Islamabad. However, after a notification issued by the ministry on November 22, now the 33 colleges are part of the Education College and FDE has no longer a supervisory role on them. This means after the local government elections when the FDE will be devolved to the local government, the mayor will have no say in the affairs of the colleges.
Many of the colleges have school sections as well and it is yet to be decided what will be the fate of these school sections.
Meanwhile, the associations of schoolteachers, non-teaching staff and school heads have decided to oppose the move. 
Their action committee headed by Fazal-i-Mola through a statement said on Monday that the committee will start an awareness campaign in all educational institutions and from Tuesday they will start boycotting classes.
Schoolteachers Association President Malik Ameer Khan said a protest rally will also be organised.
“We will not accept this Act. Educational institutions should remain part of the education ministry,” he said.
On the other hand, college teachers have been supporting the ministry’s move of placing colleges under the control of the Federal College of Education, H-9.
President of the teachers of Federal Government Colleges has welcomed this move.
President College Teachers Association Dr Rahima Rehman said: “This was our longstanding demand that the higher education setup of ICT (colleges) should be administered by the federal ministry without any involvement of the FDE. We are now very optimistic about the resolution of our issues under the umbrella of the ministry,” she said.
The tenure of the local government ended in February this year and the government was supposed to hold new elections within 120 days. However, the elections are yet to be held. Recently, the government got the ordinance approved from the cabinet and was promulgated. However, it is not clear whether the government will hold the elections on the basis of the ordinance or will enact a law through parliament.
The life of the ordinance is 120 days, extendable for one more term. Currently, the Election Commission of Pakistan is in the process of completing delimitation of constituencies/wards and will issue a final list in February.

IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah while hearing identical petitions against the land acquisition for these sectors reminded the FGEHA that the owners of land were the main stakeholders in development of any sector but the authority was treating them otherwise.
Justice Minallah observed that it was an injustice that the authority forcibly acquired land from villagers and the adjudicator for any land acquisition dispute was its executive board, but every member of the FGEHA executive board was the beneficiary of the development of both the sectors.
It may be noted that subsequent to the August 17 balloting of plots for F-14 and F-15, the FGEHA executive board unanimously approved one plot for each of its members.
The IHC, however, suspended the decision of the executive board. Justice Minallah has also suspended the allotments of all the 4,723 plots to top judges, including Chief Justice of Pakistan Gulzar Ahmed, senior puisne judge Umar Atta Bandial along with 50 other judges of the superior courts, senior bureaucrats and others.
Justice Minallah pointed out that since the FGEHA had developed pecuniary interest of its board members how they would adjudicate upon appeals against the acquisition of land for these sectors.
He also expressed displeasure over the authority for lingering on the matter.
The court, however, asked the director law of the FGEHA to examine cases of affected landowners to redress their grievances.
Advocate Danyal, a counsel for the landowners, however, requested the court to decide the petitions since FGEHA appeared not interested in compensating the villagers. Justice Minallah advised him to have faith in the government entity.
“Even otherwise, the petitions are pending before the IHC and the court would take up this matter again,” he added.
Further hearing in the matter was adjourned till January 18.
Meanwhile, FGEHADirector General Tariq Rashid visited the under-construction Kashmir Avenue Apartments, G-13 Chaklala Heights and Skyline Apartments.
The staff present at the sites informed the DG that there were 3,432 apartments in the Chaklala scheme while the Skyline Apartments comprised 3,945 units.
“This authority is trying hard to provide residential facilities to the allottees in a shortest possible time. Besides these projects, FGEHA is also launching other housing projects for the federal government employees and other segments of society,” said a press release issued by FGEHA.
The DG was told that 1467 apartments were also being constructed at Kashmir Avenue. The DG asked the staff to complete all the projects well on time and where necessary carry out the work in two shifts. 
Moreover, he also visited the ongoing projects in Lifestyle Residency G-13, G-15/3, F-14 and F-15 and asked for their timely completion.
The DG was told that for the first time the authority had started supplying potable water in G-14/4 through the recently completed water supply system. Previously, potable water in the sector was supplied solely by private tankers.

The crackdown was launched on instructions from Deputy Commissioner Imran Hamid Sheikh, who received complaints of short-measuring and overcharging by petrol station owners across the district. Mr Imran has also directed others to check petrol stations in their respective subdivisions. 
Following directions, Assistant Commissioner Hazro Zohaib Ahmed carried out detailed inspections of various petrol stations after complaints regarding tampered-with gauges. Fines amounting to Rs40,000 were imposed on owners of different petrol stations for tampering with gauges and short-measuring. He said that the campaign against petrol stations’ managements selling less fuel to customers, violating weight and measurement laws, would continue. 
He said that petrol pump owners and operators found to be tampering with gauges and selling petrol and diesel in lesser quantities would not be spared. He said 10 to 12 millilitres of petrol and diesel was being sold to consumers from each nozzle, conserving around 200 litres a day against an average sale of Rs10,000. 
During a raid on petrol and CNG stations in Attock, Assistant Commissioner Zarmena Wazir paid surprise visits to various petrol and CNG stations whose nozzles had discrepancies. She fined various stations for short-measuring and profiteering. Fines amounting to Rs45,000 were imposed on the owners of different petrol pumps of Jand.
A team led by Assistant Commissioner Ijaz Abdul Kareem found inaccurate petrol measuring apparatuses and expired fire extinguishers being used at a station. In Fatehjang, Assistant Commissioner Ghulam Mustafa Jutt along with officials of the municipal committee and enforcement department paid surprise visits to filling stations on Rawalpindi-Kohat Road to check gauges and per-litre prices of diesel and petrol. He imposed a fine of Rs80,000 on various filling stations as they were found guilty of tampering with nozzles and short-selling fuel. 
On the other hand citizens, especially motorists of district Attock have demanded a stringent policy to curb the sale of petrol by short measuring at fuel stations. They have pointed out that repeated campaigns and inspections by the district administration have failed to yield positive results and unfair practices continue unabated.

7,Nine awarded for their endeavours to end violence against women,"""Clear policies, legislation and changes of attitude are necessary,"" says Swedish ambassador.","ISLAMABAD: As the 16 days of activism against gender-based violence campaign kicked off across the globe, UN Women Pakistan and the Swedish embassy celebrated champions who had played their part in accelerating efforts to end violence against women and girls in the past year.
The event titled ‘2020 in Retrospective – Celebrating Pledges Made to End Violence Against Women was held on Friday night and was attended by government officials, diplomats and development partners.
Welcoming guests at the ceremony, the Swedish ambassador, Henrik Persson, appreciated the concerted efforts of stakeholders to stand against gender-based violence. 
He said: “No country is unaffected. Gender-based violence is found everywhere. Clear policies, legislation and changes of attitude are necessary. The self-evident right of women, girls to decide over their own bodies is being challenged. It must be defended.”
In 2020, under the global theme of ‘Orange the World: Fund, Respond, Prevent, Collect!’ UN Women Pakistan encouraged participants to make commitments for ending violence against women, and a number of pledges were received by partners to bridge funding gaps, show political will for calling for an end to violence and ensure essential services for survivors of violence.
To appreciate the commitments and actions taken on pledges made, nine awards were presented to individuals from the federal capital, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh. The recipients were ASP Amna Baig of Islamabad police, National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser, Federal Judicial Academy Director General Hayat Ali Shah, Women Parliamentary Caucus Secretary Munazza Hassan,  Ombudsperson for Protection Against Harassment at the Workplace Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rukhshanda Naz, Sindh Commission on the Status of Women Chairperson Nuzhat Shirin, Ombudsperson for Protection Against Harassment at the Workplace Balochistan Sabira Islam, Communications Specialist at TransPeshawar Umair Khan and Secretary and Women Development Department, Balochistan Zafar Buledi.
Country Representative UN Women Sharmeela Rasool applauded the meaningful steps taken by the award winners in solidarity for ending violence against women and girls.  
“We haven’t responded to the shadow pandemic of violence against women in a way we have responded to the current pandemic of Covid-19. Without us acting together, we will not be able to end this grave violation of human rights. I appeal to all women and girls, men and boys to be the voice of the voiceless, break the cycle of violence and don’t just be a passive bystander,” she said.
Human Rights Secretary Inamullah, the chief guest at the ceremony, said: “Domestic violence acts have been promulgated by all four provincial governments. The Ministry of Human Rights has also introduced Domestic (Prevention and Protection) Bill, 2021 which has been under consideration by the Parliament. Sensitisation and awareness raising of public is one of the regular features to end violence against women.”
To symbolise hope and a brighter future for women, UN Women Global Ambassador Muniba Mazari recited a poem ‘Still I rise’ by Maya Angelou. The event ended with a celebratory performance by Natasha Humera Ejaz, a singer and songwriter from Islamabad and members of UN Women Pakistan team.
