0,Nato chief warns Russia of ‘costs’ if  it invades Ukraine,"It is the second time this year that Russia has amassed a large and unusual concentration of forces in the region, he says.","BRUSSELS: Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Friday warned Russia that any attempt to invade Ukraine would have costs, as concern mounts about a Russian military build-up near its former Soviet neighbour’s borders.
Ukraine says Moscow kept about 90,000 troops near their common border following massive war games in western Russia earlier this year. The Ukrainian Defence Ministry said units of the Russian 41st army remain near Yelnya, about 260 kilometres north of the border.
Moscow denies that its planning any invasion and refuses to provide details about troop movements on its own territory.
If Russia uses force against Ukraine that will have costs, that would have consequences, Stoltenberg said, ahead of a meeting of the 30-nation military organisations foreign ministers in Latvia Nov 30-Dec. 1, where Russia’s activities will be high on the agenda. He did not say what those costs would be.
This is the second time this year that Russia has amassed a large and unusual concentration of forces in the region, Stoltenberg told reporters. He said it includes tanks, artillery, armoured units, drones, and electronic warfare systems, as well as combat-ready troops.
This military build-up is unprovoked and unexplained. It raises tensions and it risks miscalculations, Stoltenberg said. He conceded that there is no certainty about the intentions of Russia but said that this is a military build-up by a country that has invaded Ukraine before.
Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014 after the country’s Moscow-friendly president was driven from power by mass protests. Weeks later, Russia threw its weight behind a separatist insurgency that broke out in Ukraine’s east.
Ukraine and the West accused Russia of sending its troops and weapons to back the rebels. Moscow denied that, saying that Russians who joined the separatists were volunteers. More than 14,000 people have died in the fighting that devastated Ukraines eastern industrial heartland known as Donbas.
A 2015 peace agreement brokered by France and Germany helped end large-scale battles, but efforts to reach a political settlement have failed and sporadic skirmishes have continued along the tense line of contact.
‘Very dangerous’ signals
In Kiev, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Friday that Russia was sending “very dangerous” signals with troop movements on the border, warning that his military was ready to push back any offensive.
He also claimed Kiev had uncovered a coup plot involving Russian citizens, but did not give full details.
His warning came as Western governments raise worries over Russian troop movements on Ukraine’s border, with Washington saying it has “real concerns” over the troop build-up.
“We believe that very dangerous rhetoric is coming out of Russia,” Zelensky told a wide-ranging press conference in Kiev.
“It is a signal that there could be escalation,” he said.
Zelensky said Ukraine was ready to take on Russia if Moscow decides to move troops across the border.
“There is a threat today that there will be war tomorrow,” he said, adding that Kiev’s “powerful” army was “entirely prepared”.
He called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to deny he was planning an invasion.
“The president of Russia should say in public: ‘We are not planning this’,” Zelensky said.

1,Macron tells Britain to ‘get serious’ on migrant crisis,PARIS: French President Emmanuel Macron told Britain on Friday it needed to “get serious” or remain locked out ...,"PARIS: French President Emmanuel Macron told Britain on Friday it needed to “get serious” or remain locked out of discussions over how to curb the flow of migrants escaping war and poverty across the Channel.
Macron was responding to a letter by Prime Minister Boris Johnson in which the British leader set steps that he said would deter migrants from making the perilous journey across the sea separating the two countries.
Johnson, who has previously said France was at fault, insisted in the letter that France agree on joint patrols on its shores and consent to taking back the migrants that make it to Britain.
Infuriated by the letter, and not the least by the fact that Johnson published it on Twitter, the French government cancelled an invitation to UK Home Minister Priti Patel to attend a meeting on Sunday in Calais.
The meeting with officials from Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium and the European Commission would still go ahead, Macron said.
“The (EU) ministers will work seriously to settle serious issues with serious people,” Macron told a news conference in Rome. “We will then see how to move forward efficiently with the British, if they decide to get serious,” Macron added.
The growing spat between Britain and France - and between their two leaders - is taking place just days after 27 migrants died trying to cross the narrow seaway from France to Britain, the worst tragedy on record in one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes.
France has accused Britain of managing its immigration system poorly and Macron said Johnson’s Tweet was not a “serious” way of handling matters.
“I’m surprised when things are not done seriously, we don’t communicate between leaders via tweets or published letters, we are not whistle-blowers”, he said.
Macron’s comments and the cancellation of the meeting with Patel underlined the poor post-Brexit relations between the two countries and the difficulties they may face working together to curb the flow of migrants.
“We’re fed up with (London’s) double-talk,” government spokesman Gabriel Attal said. “(French Interior Minister Gerald) Darmanin told his counterpart she was not longer welcome.” London said it hoped Paris would reconsider.
“No nation can tackle this alone and so I hope that the French will reconsider,” transport minister Grant Shapps told BBC News.
Seventeen men, seven women and three teenagers died on when their dinghy deflated in the Channel, one of many such risky journeys attempted in small, overloaded boats by people fleeing Afghanistan, Iraq and beyond.
The deaths deepened animosity between Britain and France, already at odds over post-Brexit trade rules and fishing rights.
When Britain left the EU, it was no longer able to use the bloc’s system for returning migrants to the first member state they entered.

2,"Italy, France look to mend ties with new treaty",The treaty has been signed weeks before Paris assumes the EU presidency in January,"ROME: France and Italy sought to move past recent tensions and signed a new treaty on Friday to formalise their relations, against the background of a European Union in flux.
French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi put pen to paper in a ceremony full of pomp at Rome’s Quirinale palace of President Sergio Mattarella.
An aerial acrobatics display by both countries’ air forces followed, trailing the colours of the Italian and French flags across a clear autumn sky over the capital.
Later, Macron held a private audience with Pope Francis, against the backdrop of a child abuse scandal engulfing the Catholic Church in France. At a joint press conference, Draghi said the treaty represented a “historic moment” and evoked the close relations with France, from their “republican values” to economic and cultural ties.

The treaty has been signed weeks before Paris assumes the EU presidency in January

For his part, Macron said the treaty — only the second of its type with an EU partner, after a 1963 treaty with Germany — “seals a deep friendship”.
Italy and France have long been bound by historical, cultural and linguistic ties, their relationship deepened in recent decades by their memberships of both the EU and the Nato military alliance.
The treaty was signed just weeks before France takes over the rotating EU presidency in January, and at a time of change on the continent.
Britain’s messy exit and rows between the EU’s liberal democracies and their eastern neighbours have roiled the bloc, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who took a leading role in the EU, is bowing out following September elections.
Both Draghi and Macron emphasised their commitment to closer European integration, particularly in the realm of defence.
“As founding countries of the EU... we defend a more integrated, more democratic, more sovereign Europe,” the French president said.
Macron denied Paris was looking for a “substitution” for its relationship with Berlin that has anchored the EU for more than 60 years, insisting the new Italian treaty was complementary.
‘Difficult moments’
The wide-ranging new Quirinale Treaty foresees greater cooperation in economic and industrial matters, diplomacy and defence, culture, education and climate change among others, aided by regular attendance by ministers from one country to the other’s cabinet meetings.
Macron noted Italy and France had undergone “difficult moments”, not least the diplomatic crisis in early 2019 when Italy’s then-populist government openly criticised the French president.
Ties improved with a new government in Rome later that year and have gone from strength to strength with the arrival in office in February of Draghi, a former European Central Bank chief.
Draghi thanked Macron for handing over former members of the far-left Red Brigades group that terrorised Italy in the 1970s and 1980s.

3,Iran accuses UN nuclear watchdog of bowing to West’s pressure,Tehran wants lifting of sanctions days before Vienna talks.,"TEHRAN: Iran has accused the UN’s nuclear agency of bowing to pressure from its Western financiers to “discriminate” against Tehran, as strains persist ahead of new talks to revive the 2015 atomic deal.
“It’s a reality. The IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) doesn’t deal with Iran as it should,” Behrouz Kamalvandi, spokesman of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, told state television late Thursday.
He argued that organisations such as the IAEA were “under the influence of powerful countries” which “finance them and in exchange apply pressure on them”.
In a phone call on Friday with EU diplomatic chief Josep Borrel, Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said it would be “possible to reach a favourable agreement” if sanctions are lifted.
“We will participate in the Vienna talks in good faith and seriously,” he said, while calling for “a serious and sufficient guarantee” that the United States will not leave the nuclear deal.

Tehran wants lifting of sanctions days before Vienna talks

After a mission to Tehran this week, IAEA head Rafael Grossi said his talks with Iranian officials had been “constructive” but “inconclusive”.
“In terms of the substance... we were not able to make progress,” Grossi told reporters in Vienna where the IAEA is based.
Kamalvandi said the Islamic republic was “trying to stand up for its rights and to counter the negative image that they (the international community) are trying to fabricate about us”.
Western countries “say we are seeking a nuclear weapon and that we must be prevented at all costs”, he said.
“The nuclear industry is an essential industry and one to which we are committed. Above all, we must not give up but instead pursue our efforts,” the spokesman said.
Grossi’s visit came ahead of the scheduled resumption on Monday of negotiations between Tehran and world powers aimed at reviving the 2015 nuclear deal that gave Iran sanctions relief in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.
The deal has been gradually disintegrating since former US president Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the accord in 2018.
President Joe Biden’s administration, however, says it is working to return the United States to the accord whose other parties are Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia.
Full compliance
Iran wants the lifting of all sanctions in a verifiable process, its foreign minister said on Friday, three days before nuclear talks resume in Vienna. Monday’s indirect talks between the United States and Iran, with the participation of major powers, aim at bringing the two countries into full compliance with a 2015 deal. Washington abandoned the accord in 2018 and reimposed crippling sanctions on Iran.
If the opposing sides are prepared to return to their full obligations and the lifting of sanctions, a good and even immediate agreement can be reached, minister Hossein Amir­abdollahian said in a telephone conversation with the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Joseph Borrell. Iran wants a good and verifiable agreement, Iranian media quoted Amirab­dollahian as saying.

4,Indian farmers celebrate first anniversary of protests,"Farmer groups are continuing to camp out at border points with New Delhi, waiting for the laws to be officially withdrawn.","NEW DELHI: Thousands of jubilant Indian farmers waving green and white flags on Friday marked the anniversary of their movement by celebrating a victory that forced Prime Minister Narendra Modi to withdraw three agriculture laws the farmers feared would drastically reduce their incomes and leave them at the mercy of corporations.
Using tractors, jeeps and cars, farmers from New Delhi’s neighboring states last November converged on the highways on the outskirts of the capital, braving a harsh winter, a scorching summer and a devastating coronavirus surge.
Farmer groups are continuing to camp out, mainly at Singhu, Tikri, and Ghazipur border points with New Delhi, waiting for the laws to be officially withdrawn during a parliament session scheduled to begin next week. Rakesh Tikait, a top farmer leader, said they also want government assurances of guaranteed prices for certain essential crops, like wheat and rice a system introduced in the 1960s to help India shore up its food reserves and prevent shortages. He demanded that the government set up a committee to settle their demand.
“We are not going away until our other demands are met,” he said. There was no immediate response by the government.
Lal Kumar, a 42-year-old farmer, said “Modi has accepted defeat.” With his low farm income, Kumar said he was not able to look after his family properly.
Farmers worried that the now-withdrawn laws would have left them at the mercy of corporations that would have no legal obligation to pay them guaranteed prices.

5,"Putin hosts Azeri, Armenian leaders in bid to defuse tensions","The goal, a year into the truce, is to create conditions for the revival of the region, stresses Russian president.","MOSCOW: Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday hosted the leaders of regional rivals Armenia and Azerbaijan for talks marking the first anniversary of a Moscow-brokered peace deal that ended fighting in the separatist region of Nagorno-Karabakh.
In the southern city of Sochi, Putin held a bilateral meeting with Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev. Then the Russian president met with Aliyev and Armenia’s Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan together, and after that he said he would have a separate bilateral meeting with Pashinyan.
Opening the meetings, Putin said a lot has been done over the past year, but not all the issues are yet resolved. He pointed to repeated clashes on the border between the two nations that resulted in multiple casualties.
The goal, a year into the truce, is to create conditions for the revival of the region, so that people can feel safe there and be able to carry out normal economic activities ... develop the economy, Putin stressed.
Armenia and Azerbaijan have been locked in a decades-old dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh, a region that lies within Azerbaijan but was under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a separatist war there ended in 1994.
The Azerbaijani military routed the Armenian forces in 44 days of fierce fighting in the fall of 2020, which ended with a Russia-brokered peace deal that saw Azerbaijan gain control of a significant part of Nagorno-Karabakh and reclaim all the regions controlled by Armenian forces outside the separatist region.
Russia has deployed nearly 2,000 peacekeepers for at least five years to monitor the peace deal.
The peace agreement was celebrated as a triumph in Azerbaijan but was seen as a betrayal by the opposition in Armenia. Pashinyan defe­n­­ded it as the only way to prevent the Armenian forces from losing control over the entire Nagorno-Kara­bakh region.
The 2020 deal envisaged a transport corridor via Armenia that would link Azerbaijan with its exclave of Nakhchivan region a plan resented by the Armenian opposition, which also fears that Armenian interests could be compromised by the planned demarcation of the border.
Putin on Friday said Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia achieved a lot in a year that passed since the peace deal was signed.

6,Protest paralyses Dhaka after student’s death,"“We are not against the government. We just want safety on roads,” says one student.","DHAKA: Huge crowds blockaded busy streets and harassed drivers in the Bangladeshi capital on Thursday to protest the death of a high school student in a road accident.
Thousands of uniformed students brought traffic to a standstill around Dhaka’s main commercial district and near the national parliament.
Others marched to the city mayor’s office, demanding a fast-track prosecution for the driver of a garbage truck accused of fatally running over the pupil.
“We won’t return home until we get justice,” Sabit Bin Arif said.
“We want justice. We want safety of our lives on the roads. How can we sit back when our friend got killed by such negligence?” the 18-year-old added.
Students were seen approaching vehicles — including police vans — and asking those behind the steering wheel to show their driving licenses.
In 2018, similar street protests sparked by the deaths of two students in a bus accident grew into a nationwide movement that stopped traffic around the country for a week, prompting a government crackdown.
Authorities later introduced a road law increasing punishments for reckless driving, but students participating in Thursday’s protest said the measures did not go far enough. “We won’t return home until our rights are ensured this time,” Israt Jahan Ivy, 17, told AFP.  “We are not against the government. We just want safety on roads.”

7,Pope tells Macron ‘I’m still alive’ during Vatican talks,"VATICAN CITY: Pope Francis, 84, joked on Friday “I’m still alive” when asked by French President Emmanuel...","VATICAN CITY: Pope Francis, 84, joked on Friday “I’m still alive” when asked by French President Emmanuel Macron how things were going at the start of hour-long private talks in the Vatican.
A video released by the Vatican of the two before and after the talks in the papal library showed the two to be very friendly, with both laughing.
When the president sat at the pope’s desk and asked how things were going, Francis answered in Italian “I’m still alive.” He shortly later said “perfect” but it was unclear whether he was referring to the same question.
Francis was hospitalised for 11 days in July during which he underwent surgery to remove part of his colon, which had narrowed. It was the first time he had been hospitalised since his election in 2013.
A Vatican statement did not disclose what the two had discussed privately but said Macron’s talks with top Vatican diplomats afterwards included climate change, Lebanon, the Middle East, Africa, and the forthcoming French Presidency of the European Union.
Shortly before the papal audience, Macron had told reporters he wanted to talk to Francis, among other things, about the equitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccines, the Lebanon crisis and migration.

8,"Afghan humanitarian crisis, drug trafficking alarm China, India, Russia",Statement calls on Taliban to respect results of UN resolutions on Afghanistan and the central role of UN in the country.,"NEW DELHI: The foreign ministers of India, Russia and China expressed concern on Friday at the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Afghanistan and the spread of drug trafficking in the country.
Afghanistan has been plunged into crisis by the abrupt end of billions of dollars in foreign assistance, following the collapse of the Western-backed government and return to power of the Taliban in August.
“Expressing concern over deteriorating humanitarian situation in Afghanistan, the Ministers called for immediate and unhindered humanitarian assistance to be provided to Afghanistan,” said a joint statement released following a virtual meeting between India’s S Jaishankar, Russia’s Sergey Lavrov and China’s Wang Yi.
The statement called on the Taliban to respect the results of United Nations resolutions on Afghanistan and the central role of the UN in the country.
The three countries also pledged to do more to combat drug smuggling in the region.
“The spread of illicit drug trafficking in opiates and methamphetamine from Afghanistan and beyond... poses a serious threat to regional security and stability and provides funding for terrorist organizations,” the statement added.

The UN health agency said early evidence on the variant, until now known by the technical term B.1.1.529, has shown an increased risk of reinfection compared to other highly transmissible variants, indicating that people who contracted Covid and recovered could be more subject to catching it again with Omicron. 
The WHO suggested that the variant could pose greater risks than the delta variant, which was first detected in India and has been causing ravages worldwide.
The WHO announcement marks the first time in months that it has classified a Covid variant as a highly-transmissible variant of concern. The classification also applies to delta, which has become the world’s most prevalent variant.
