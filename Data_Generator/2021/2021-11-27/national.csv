0,Nadra wants FIA official’s explanation over remarks,Says its data is not available online and has never been hacked or compromised.,"ISLAMABAD: A day after remarks of a senior Federal Investigation Agency’s (FIA) official about security of the National Database Registration Authority’s (Nadra) data set off alarm bells, Nadra on Friday rejected as misleading the claim of citizens’ data being compromised. 
Making it clear that Nadra’s data was not available online and had never been hacked or compromised, a senior Nadra official said the Authority does not provide unauthorised access either to its databases or citizen ID data. 
“Instead, multi-layered control mechanisms and well-defined policies and practices have been implemented for the security and protection of all data that Nadra stores by taking all preventive measures”. 
He said the Nadra management has taken a strong exception to what he called an irresponsible statement issued by a senior government official and has requested the relevant authorities to seek an explanation from the officer concerned. 

Says its data is not available online and has never been hacked or compromised

“These baseless insinuations carry unintended consequences, including reputational damage to the organisation servicing foreign governments and clients as the leading system integrator.” 
He regretted that as the irresponsible statement came at a critical juncture when Nadra after a lapse of six years was re-establishing its footprints as one of the leading ID solutions providers in the world and establishing prowess as trailblazer in ID world, such an allegation may result in hampering its efforts to regain market place in ID world. 
He said Nadra, as the national registration authority, ensures through its design, policies and practices that privacy of citizens’ ID remains utmost priority. 
In this regard, Nadra has always developed its products, services and infrastructure by incorporating security by default (SbD) protocols that ensures the protection of data at utmost level. 
In addition, implementing a privacy-by-design-and-security-by-default (PbD &SbD) approach, Nadra deploys four types of controls in order to ensure privacy and protection of data. Moreover, Nadra IT and information security controls are aligned with world’s best information and security practices and standard ISO 27001 (ISMS). 
The IT infrastructure of Nadra goes through regular internal and external security audits and vulnerability and penetration testing. 
“Nadra uses the Defence in Depth (DiD) multi-layered approach to cyber security in which a series of defensive mechanisms are layered to protect citizens’ data and information. If one mechanism fails, another steps up immediately to thwart an attack,” he explained. 
Nadra Chairman Tariq Malik, when contacted, linked malicious and baseless stories against Nadra with the attempts of Pakistan’s enemies to trigger creative chaos and create a trust deficit between the State and citizens. 
He was disappointed to see how non-technical bureaucrats and some public servants play naively in furthering the agenda of enemies. 
“Nadra’s data has been compromised, it has been hacked,” FIA Cybercrime Wing Additional Director Tariq Pervez claimed during a briefing to the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Information Technology and Telecommunication on Thursday. 
He subsequently attempted to clarify his remarks and said that all of Nadra’s data had not been hacked. “During the SIM verification process involving biometric data, Nadra’s biometric system is compromised,” he said, without providing further explanation. 
Later on FIA retracted from the rem­arks of the additional director made during the meeting of the National Assembly Standing Committee on Information Technology and Telecommunication. 
An official statement issued by FIA authorities said, “It is clarified that no such statement was given about the hacking of data which had been misrepresented”. 
Denying any such hacking of biometric data, Nadra in an official statement issued immediately on Thursday said Nadra multi-biometric data is secure and well protected from any hacking attempt.

The first and only woman in Pakistan to reach the rank of three-star general has also become the first-ever female colonel commandant of the AMC. She earlier served as surgeon general of Pakistan Army.
The installation ceremony was held at AMC Centre in Abbottabad. 
Speaking on the occasion, the COAS lauded contributions of AMC towards ensuring high standards of health care during peace and war, according to Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). 
Gen Bajwa said AMC had always answered the call of duty during natural calamities, both inland and abroad. “Our doctors and paramedic staff have been frontline warriors against Covid-19 and displaying exemplary commitment and resolve for safety and well-being of the people of Pakistan,” he remarked. 
He said installation of the first-ever three-star female general officer as colonel commandant of AMC was indeed a matter of immense pride for the army and the country. 
He said keeping pace with rapid advancements in medical science was imperative for the doctors and paramedics to keep themselves at par with modern militaries and best global practices in health care.
Earlier, on his arrival at Abbottabad, the COAS laid wreath at Yadgar-i-Shuhada and offered Fateha. 
The military’s media wing stated Lt Gen Johar hails from Panjpeer village in Swabi district.
According to a media rep­ort, she is daughter of Col Qadir, who had served in the Inter-Services Intelli­gence and niece of retired major Mohammad Aamir who also had served in ISI. Both her parents had died in a car accident over three decades ago.

2,Supreme Court to take up MNA Ali Wazir’s appeal on Monday,"Police arrested Wazir on Dec 16, 2020 in Peshawar at the request of the Sindh police, and flew him to Karachi.","ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court will take up an appeal of Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM) leader MNA Ali Wazir on Monday against the Sindh High Court’s (SHC) judgement earlier this year that dismissed his bail application.  
The plea will be taken up by a three-judge Supreme Court bench comprising Justice Umar Ata Bandial, Justice Sajjad Ali Shah and Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah.  
On Friday, a different bench head­­ed by Justice Sardar Tariq Masood took up the petition moved by Advo­cate Salahuddin Khan Gandapur on behalf of Mr Wazir but the bench ordered fixing the case for Monday after accepting the adjournment request by the prosecutor general of Sindh.
Police arrested Mr Wazir on Dec 16, 2020 in Peshawar at a request of the Sindh police, and flew him to Karachi.
Mr Wazir was arrested on the charges of making insulting and incendiary speeches against the state institutions at a PTM protest rally in Karachi on Dec 6, 2020. An FIR was lodged against him the following day in the Sohrab Goth police station.  
The interned PTM lawmaker, through his counsel, approached the SHC for bail after an anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Karachi had dismissed a similar application in February this year. 
The appeal has pleaded before the apex court to set aside the high court order since it is not sustainable under the law and facts. It has also stated that Mr Wazir is innocent and did not commit the offence under which he was arrested. 
Moreover, the SHC and the ATC had failed to appreciate that witnesses named in the FIR challan were not independent witnesses but police personnel, the petition argued. 
The petition regretted that no independent witness was cited against the appellant from the area where the public meeting was held. Therefore, a National Assembly member — who was himself struggling for the supremacy of parliament and the rule of law, the Constitution and for the democratic and human rights of the citizens — had been implicated in a false case. 
The appellant had no criminal history or any other pending cases against him, the petition stated and questioned any independent evidence, direct or indirect, to connect Mr Wazir with offences like criminal conspiracy, waging war against the state, assaulting the president and governor, promoting enmity between different groups, disobeying law and order, and circulating rumours to cause mutiny. 
The appeal argued that Mr Wazir was arrested and implicated in the case due to political rivalry with the ruling party. 
The appeal also questioned whether the appellant was arrested and the FIR was lodged against him after seeking approval from the National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser. 
The SHC, according to the appeal, had failed to appreciate that the appellant was entitled to bail since no independent witness was ever produced against him during the trial. 
In its June 1 order, the SHC noted: “Upon a tentative assessment of the transcript of the speech which is on record, we have observed that uncouth, vulgar, obscene and uncivilized language has been used by the applicant against institutions of the state apart from language and words that may have the potential of creating disharmony and inciting provincial differences.” 
The SHC also observed that it was incumbent upon all persons and institutions of the country to ensure the stability and security of Pakistan and not to incite feelings that had the potential to lead to the contrary. 
The bench further noted that a healthy and constructive criticism against any person or institution, expressed in a civilised manner, should be permissible, but a distinction must be drawn between criticism and spewing venom through uncouth language, which could not be permitted on the basis of the freedom of expression when it may lead to destabilisation of the country.

3,Delay in ML-1 approval hinders efforts to reduce train accidents,PR wants to rehabilitate 470km Khanpur-Kotri track immediately,"LAHORE: The Pakistan Railways (PR) could face major accidents on the decaying rail line from Khanpur to Kotri, as the federal government continues to delay the approval of Rs30 billion PC-1 for track rehabilitation it received from the department around three months ago. 
On the other hand, the approval of the ML-1 (Main Line-1) project to be completed under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) seems elusive, leaving the railways with no option but to continue operations on the existing line. 

PR wants to rehabilitate 470km Khanpur-Kotri track immediately

“The situation is very disappointing as the Rs30bn PC-1 meant for rehabilitation of the 470-kilometre critical line-1 track from Khanpur to Kotri — a stretch that has seen the majority of fatal and non-fatal accidents, especially in the last three years — is yet to be approved by the Planning Commission despite the fact the PR sent the proposal about three months ago,” an official source said while talking to Dawn on Friday. 
“The delay may lead to major accidents on this portion anytime in the future, as the track is in a dilapidated condition and is considered a high-risk area,” the official requesting anonymity warned. 
When asked about the reasons behind the delay, he said the commission is confused about approving the project. Senior officials are of the view that the CPEC’s ML-1 project is supposed to rehabilitate the entire rail track from Karachi to Peshawar and is already pending approval by the Chinese government, so execution of this scheme worth Rs30bn could be questioned in the future. 
“They (the commission) are in a fix whether to approve this project or not at a time when the ML-1 project approval is awaiting the Chinese nod. They know the expense incurred on the Khanpur-Kotri track rehabilitation can be included and later deducted from the Chinese financing after approval of the ML-1 project, hence they are indecisive about it,” the official said, requesting the federal government to intervene and press the commission to approve the project. 
Under the project, the PR aims to rehabilitate 15km to 25km critical stretches on the 470km Khanpur-Kotri portion by replacing them with new tracks, while maintenance of the less-dangerous portions is also part of the project. The decision was taken after the PR felt that since the ML-1 project approval was facing delays, it should start rehabilitation of the critical portions of the track (mainly in Sukkur and Karachi divisions) on its own in funding collaboration with the federal government to avert accidents. 
The PR had also requested the Chinese authorities to at least allow it to initiate the bidding process for the $6.8bn ML-1 project and that any issues related to its cost revision could be solved later. 
The PR chief executive officer was not available for comments despite attempts.

4,AJK boy detained by Indian army; family calls for repatriation,Teenager inadvertently strays across unmarked LoC.,"MUZAFFARABAD: Family of a teenage resident of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) on Friday urged the Indian authorities to release and repatriate him at the earliest because he had strayed across the Line of Control (LoC) out of ignorance. 
Rashid Naeem Khan, Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of police in Poonch division, told Dawn by telephone that 14-year-old Asmaad Ali of Tetrinote village was believed to have strayed across the unmarked dividing line sometime in the afternoon on Thursday where he was taken into custody by the Indian army for questioning. 
The 9th grade student was living with his maternal grandparents who had raised him after the death of his mother in his infancy, he said. 

Teenager inadvertently strays across unmarked LoC

Mohammad Hameed, one of the relatives of Asmaad, told Dawn that the boy went to board his grandmother on a bus at 11am on Thursday but did not return home afterwards. 
“Normally, while playing with colleagues he would return home after sunset. However, when he did not return home till late evening, we contacted different relatives to inquire about his whereabouts but to no avail,” he said. 
DIG Khan said no complaint was lodged by Asmaad’s family with the police about his disappearance until a brief news item by an Indian wire service revealed his detention by the Indian army on the other side of the divide. 
Mr Hameed said all relatives, particularly the grandparents, of the teenager were in a state of shock and stress, amid worries about his safety. “We all make an impassioned appeal to the Indian authorities to release and return him at the earliest because he has wandered across the divide out of ignorance,” he said. 
DIG Khan pointed out that unlike occupied Kashmir, many AJK areas along the LoC had civilian populations ahead of the Pakistan army posts which was why unintentional movement across the unmarked divide, mostly by the women and young children, occurred sporadically.
“Unmindful of the hazards of their carelessness, young children and women often go astray along the LoC and land in trouble on the other side,” he said. 
He recalled that in many cases Indian army had itself intruded into the AJK side of the LoC and whisked away innocent civilians, such as the Aug 18 seizure of three young boys who were fishing in a water channel serving as LoC in Taroti (Abbaspur) area of Poonch district. 
Those boys were repatriated by the Indian army after two days.

5,"Questionnaire for next census sent to CCI for approval, minister told",Asad Umar chairs meeting to review progress made for holding the exercise in 2022,"ISLAMABAD: The questionnaire for the 2022 census has been finalised by the advisory committee and a summary has been forwarded to the Council of Common Interests (CCI) for approval, Federal Minister for Planning Development and Special Initiatives Asad Umar was informed on Friday. 
Mr Umar was chairing the third progress review meeting on the 7th Population and Housing Census 2022, the digital census.  
In a detailed presentation on the work plan and the progress made, the meeting was informed that the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) was strictly following the timelines and was so far on track to finalise the data in December 2022 for provision to the Election Commission of Pakistan for the delimitation process ahead of 2023 general elections.  
The participants were informed that the federal cabinet on Oct 5 had already approved the recommendations of the census advisory committee for forwarding them to the CCI. 

Asad Umar chairs meeting to review progress made for holding the exercise in 2022

Keeping in view the challenging timelines and gigantic activity of the first-ever digital census, the PBS was collaborating with different national organisations like National Telecommunication Communication, National Database and Registration Authority, Space and Upper Atmos­phere Research Commission, and National Radio and Telecom­muni­cation Corporation for the provision of services to complete the exercise in a successful manner, the meeting was informed. 
Detailed consultative meetings held with all stakeholders and all major preparatory activities will be completed by the end of March next year. 
The participants were further informed that an advertisement has also been prepared for hiring a firm for a social media campaign for the public. 
Mr Umar said that PBS should initiate the sharing of all activities of the census for awareness of all stakeholders, the provinces must be involved in all processes, and sensitisation seminars may be held at each provincial headquarter for awareness and broader involvement of all stakeholders. 
He emphasised that quality of services along with timeliness must be kept in mind before finalising the potential partners. 
He further said that proper monitoring of all activities with Gantt charts must be done professionally through specialised software for timely completion of activities. 
The meeting was also attended by the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, secretary planning development and special initiatives, and PBS chief statistician, among others.

6,Pakistan may attend US democracy summit,Observers say that Pakis­tan might consult China before announcing its participation.,"WASHINGTON: The US State Department on Friday issued the final list of the nations invited to the Summit of Democracy Washington is hosting on Dec 9-10 and the list includes Pakistan. 
Diplomatic observers in Washington say that Pakistan is likely to participate in the 110-nation virtual summit, as it will boost its efforts to re-establish economic and political ties with the United States, which, until recently, was a close ally. 
“Prime Minister Imran Khan, who visited the United States in July 2019, will address the summit as well, if Pakistan agrees to participate,” a diplomatic source said.
Those invited can confirm their participation by the end of next week. 
Observers say that Pakis­tan might consult China before announcing its participation as the US decision to invite Taiwan, instead of Beijing, has angered China. 
China’s Foreign Ministry said earlier this week that it was “firmly opposed” to the invitation. “US actions only go to show democracy is just a cover and a tool for it to advance its geopolitical objectives, oppress other countries, divide the world and serve its own interests,” Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters in Beijing. 
Observers in Washington acknowledge that the invitation puts Pakistan in a difficult spot as it also fears giving India a free hand by opting out of the summit. Pakistan is worried about India’s growing influence in the United States since 2011, when Osama bin Lad­en’s presence in Abbottabad strained Islamabad’s relations with Washington. 
From South Asia, the United States has invited both India and Pakistan but has kept Bangladesh out. Nepal has been invited too, although Sri Lanka is out. 
Observers say the invitations show that American interests in the region played a key role in making the guest list. Three invitees — India, Pakistan and Nepal — have borders with China and the US wants to maintain friendly ties with them to counter China’s growing influence. 
Apparently, strategic interests persuaded Washington to ignore concerns for democracy while inviting these three nations to the summit. 
As expected, the Taliban-run Afghanistan is out too. Washington wants Kabul to form an inclusive government and undertake major social and political reforms, if it wants US recognition. 
Russia has also been kept out of the summit, although both China and Russia are major world powers. With almost 1.40 billion people, China is the world’s most populous country, followed by India with almost 1.34bn people. 
Russia is the largest country by far, with a total area of about 17 million square kilometres. China is also the fourth-largest in area, after Russia, Canada, and the United States. 
Two major Middle Eas­tern nations — Turkey and Iran — are also out of the summit, although Iraq has been invited. Azerbaijan, which has a land dispute with Armenia, is out too, although Armenia has been invited. Azerbaijan has an authoritarian regime, as do other Middle Eastern and Central Asian nations. 
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are also out, apparently for being kingdoms, although the United Kingdom, a constitutional monarchy, is on the list. 
So are Australia, Canada and New Zealand that recognise the British queen as their sovereign. 
Egypt and Syria are also out of the list as they too have authoritarian regimes. Israel has been invited because it holds regular elections.

7,PFUJ denounces minister’s statement,ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists has condemned the statement of Information Minister Fawad...,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists has condemned the statement of Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry regarding the national convention organised by the PFUJ recently on Freedom of Media and Freedom of Expression.  
It asked the information minister to refrain from generating fake news to divert public attention from real issues, such as the shrinking civic space for debate, discussion and dissent.  
The information minister had said the Federal Investigation Agency and the Economic Affairs Division should probe affairs of the Free and Fair Election Network (FAFEN), which had provided funding for the PFUJ convention. 
In a tweet, Mr Chaudhry said he had called for a probe after Sarwar Bari, a former head of the FAFEN, had levelled serious allegations against the network and the convention.
Reacting to the tweets and statements issued by Mr Chaudhry and Minister of State Farrukh Habib, PFUJ’s President Shahzada Zulfiqar and Secretary General Nasir Zaidi termed them “irresponsible”.  
They said the event was organised to hold an open debate on the unannounced censorship and curbs on the national media by the PTI government. “Holding such open debates is a mandate and responsibility of civil society and no threats by any minister can deter us from pursuing our path to achieve freedom of press and freedom of expression in the country,” they said.  
The PFUJ leadership noted that since the inception of PTI government, Pakistan is being viewed as a country where “democratic norms and practices” are being compromised. “Pakistan has dropped to its lowest level in the World Press Freedom Index during the last three years,” they said. “This speaks volumes about the coercive policies of the government.”

Leaders of the student organisations involved announced their decision after six rounds of talks with a committee headed by provincial Minister Sardar Abdul Rehman Khetran. 
Speaking at a joint press conference, Mr Khetran, student leader Zubair Baloch and others announced that all universities of the province would restart classes from Saturday for 15 days as the government had assured recovery of the two missing students within 15 days. 
However, they said that Balochistan University would remain closed till the recovery of the two missing students, Faseih Baloch and Sohail Baloch.
Sardar Khetran said the two students had gone missing on November 1, triggering a protest sit-in and causing closure of the Balochistan University, but as a result of several rounds of talks with leaders of the student organisations, the students had agreed to restore educational activities in all closed universities, except Balochistan University.
“We will make all possible efforts to trace two missing students Faseih Baloch and Sohail Baloch within 15 days,” Sardar Khetran said, adding that the governor and the chief minister had taken the issue seriously and in this connection all officials concerned would be taken on board.
Zubair Baloch of the Baloch Student Organisation said that protesting students had given 15 days to the parliamentary committee for the recovery of the missing students and during these 15 days all universities, except Balochistan University, would reopen and resume educational activities.
“We want an open educational environment to be created in the educational institutions for students so that they can study without any interference.”
Sardar Abdul Rehman Khetran said that after improvement in law and order situation in the province, check posts of security forces had been gradually reduced, but as was in the past, necessary police personnel would remain present at the check posts.
