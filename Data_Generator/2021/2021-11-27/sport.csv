He and Mushfiqur Rahim combined for an undefeated 204-run partnership after Bangladesh were reduced to 49-4 in the first session. 
They kept the Pakistan bowlers at bay from the first half of the morning session through the entire second and third sessions. 
At stumps owing to bad light, Liton was on 113 and Mushfiqur on 82. 
“The guys showed a great deal of character and skills after we were 40-odd for four today, Bangladesh batting coach Ashwell Prince said. 
“I was really impressed by how calm and composed Liton was. The most nervous everyone got was when Liton started getting cramps. We were hoping that his body can hang in their till the end of the day. He is going to recover tonight, and hopefully he can continue tomorrow.”

The first hour belonged to the Pakistan fast bowlers, who utilised the early moisture on the pitch. 
Opener Saif Hasan hit fast bowler Hasan Ali for two boundaries in the second over to hint at a good start for Bangladesh.
Opening partner Shadman Islam struggled against Shaheen Shah Afridi, who moved the ball well, but Saif grew with confidence, driving the left-arm pacer through mid-off for four. 
Shaheen broke through with the next delivery when Saif fended a short delivery to short leg to Abid Ali for 14. 
Shadman also fell for 14, as Hasan had him leg before after leaking runs in his opening spell. 
Bangladesh skipper Mominul Haque fell soon afterwards, scoring just six as off-spinner Sajid Khan spun one sharply to take an edge that was gladly accepted by wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan. 
The umpire initially declared Mominul not out but the decision was overruled on review. 
Najmul Hossain Shanto got off the mark with a four but he too soon perished for 14, cutting a Faheem Ashraf delivery straight to Sajid at point. 
Liton and Mushfiqur were duly cautious at the start and survived some tricky moments before they dominated. 
They went unscathed in the whole middle session during which they raised their half-centuries and Liton hit Sajid for the lone six of the day. 
Liton, who was dropped from the Twenty20 squad following a poor T20 World Cup, chopped left-arm spinner Nauman Ali’s short delivery past backward point to the boundary to bring up his half-century off 95 balls. 
“I didn’t ask anything of him [Liton] during the T20 series,” batting coach Prince said. “We worked on one or two little technical things. It was more about changing his stance, and basically his alignment to get him lined up better.” 
With the pitch offering nothing for the bowlers, the Pakistan pacers came up with a short balls plan which almost worked as Liton, on 67, mistimed one off Shaheen but Sajid put down the catch at midwicket. 
Liton then became more watchful. 
Mushfiqur, meanwhile, raised his 24th half-century with consecutive boundaries against Hasan off 108 balls. He survived because of a no-ball by Nauman after sweeping straight to point. 
Playing with caution, Liton reached his first Test century off 199 balls after pushing Nauman to mid-off for a tricky single. He had to dive to complete the run after pushing Sajid at midoff and a direct hit could have cost him his wicket. 
Mushfiqur hugged Liton as he stood back to kiss his helmet and raise his bat responding to applaud from the gallery and the dressing room. 
Pakistan took the new ball as soon as it was available without reward for another five overs. 
“We had a good first session by taking early wickets. We should appreciate the way Liton Das and Mushfiqur Rahim batted. They played really well,” Hasan said. 
“It’s a slow pitch and we need to bowl in good areas to get break-through. At this moment, Bangladesh are in good position but our batters are in a good form and they have the ability to score better on this track.” 
Pakistan handed batsman Abdullah Shafique a Test debut and Yasir Ali was making his Test bow for Bangladesh in the two-match series.

1,NZ openers block out India after Southee five-for,Latham and Young produced the first century opening partnership by a visiting team on Indian soil in five years,"KANPUR: Tom Latham and Will Young defied India to lead New Zealand to 129 without loss in reply to the home side’s 345, leaving the opening Test at Kanpur’s Green Park Stadium evenly poised on Friday. 
After Tim Southee bowled the Black Caps back into contention with a five-for, Latham and Young produced the first century opening partnership by a visiting team on Indian soil in five years. 
At stumps, Latham was 50 not out and Young 75 not out, having survived 41 testing overs of spin by Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel. Play ended due to bad light with three overs remaining. 
They trail by 216 runs after bowling out India three overs after lunch with Southee claiming 5-69, on a track that had prompted both sides to pack three spinners into their respective teams. 
Shreyas Iyer, on 75 overnight, achieved a century on debut and was out for a team-best 105. Iyer became the 16th India batsman to score a hundred on Test debut. He faced 171 balls, hit 13 fours and two sixes. 
“I was happy the way everything went on day one. [But] I couldn’t get any sleep last night, Iyer said. “I had to still focus again today. I was up early at 5 a.m., but when you make a century, it is a wonderful feeling. [After presenting his cap], Sunil Gavaskar motivated me and told me to enjoy the moment.” 
India had resumed on 258-4 and all eyes were on Iyer as the 26-year-old, only making his debut with several frontline batsmen rested, approached his hundred. 
He showed no nerves and hit Kyle Jamieson (3-91) for back-to-back boundaries and then took two off him to bring up his century, the Mumbai batsman kissing his helmet and raising his arms while the sparse crowd in the stadium cheered.
Southee, who had dismissed Ravindra Jadeja for his overnight score of 50, wrecked India’s middle and lower order. 
His victims included Iyer, who played a lazy drive that was pouched by Will Young at cover. It was a tame end to an otherwise stellar knock studded with two sixes and 13 boundaries. 
Southee, who bowled 11 overs on the trot in the morning session, went on to complete his 13th five-wicket haul in Test cricket. 
It was a terrific bowling display by the 32-year-old, who missed part of Thursday’s play with a groin strain but returned to torment the Indians after taking pain-killers. 
“Having played a bit of cricket, you tend to sort of be able to play through some sort of stiffness and some soreness...,” he said. “It’s nothing new to be able to play through a little bit of pain...I think the best painkiller is wickets.” 
Spinner Ajaz Patel removed the last two Indian batsmen as New Zealand conceded 87 runs on Friday to claim the last six wickets. 
Thereafter, New Zealand didn’t give a single whiff to the India bowlers. 
Latham and Young added 72 runs before tea and completely stumped the India attack with their defiance. 
Their 50-run stand came up in 125 balls. 
After tea, they continued to grind against the spinners, who were at fault for bowling too flat. 
Young hit 12 boundaries in his assured knock, while Latham’s stay was more eventful.
The 29-year-old was given out lbw twice early in his knock but survived as replays confirmed edges before the ball hit his pad on both occasions. 
He was adjudged caught behind in the final overs too but once again Latham successfully reviewed the decision to prolong his stay.

2,"Rain ends first match, rest of Dutch tour of SA in jeopardy",CENTURION: Heavy rain brought an end to the first One-day International between South Africa and the Netherlands on...,"CENTURION: Heavy rain brought an end to the first One-day International between South Africa and the Netherlands on Friday, while coronavirus fears put the remaining two matches in doubt.  
The Netherlands were 11 for no wicket in reply to South Africa’s 277 for eight when a storm broke over SuperSport Park.  
Kyle Verreynne hit a career-best 95, one-day newcomer Zubayr Hamza made 56 and all-rounder Andile Phehlukwayo thrashed six sixes in a 22-ball 48 in an otherwise lacklustre home batting performance. 
The washout was another setback for South Africa in a stuttering campaign in the International Cricket Council’s World Cup Super League.  
South Africa have yet to win a series in the league and were strong favourites to beat one of the league’s weaker teams.  
While the rain fell in Centurion, officials from Cricket South Africa and the Netherlands board were discussing whether the second and third matches, scheduled for Sunday and Wednesday, would go ahead.  
Unconfirmed reports that the tour had been called off proved premature but a joint statement confirmed that the Dutch team were keen to go home — but could not immediately find flights out of Johannesburg.  
The statement said a decision on the remaining matches would be made “in the next 24 to 48 hours”.  
“Cricket South Africa (CSA) and Koninklijke Nederlandse Cricket Bond (KNCB) are aware of news reports doing the rounds regarding the Netherlands tour to South Africa being cancelled or postponed,” the statement read.  
“Both boards can confirm that following updated information, it is highly unlikely that the visiting team will be able to fly out of South Africa over the weekend.” 
New restrictions on travellers from South Africa were announced by the British government on Thursday and followed on Friday by travel bans by several European Union countries, including the Netherlands, following the discovery of a new variant of coronavirus, B.1.1.529, in South Africa.  
South Africa were sent in to bat on a slow pitch on Friday.  
Wicketkeeper-batsman Verreynne fell five runs short of maiden ODI century but helped South Africa recover from 24-2 as he featured in a 119-run partnership with Hamza.  
The other specialist batsmen were tied down by steady Dutch bowling and it took an eighth wicket stand of 68 off 40 balls between Phehlukwayo and captain Keshav Maharaj (18 not out) to boost the South African total.

3,ECB unveils action plan to tackle racism following Rafiq allegations,"The Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) Action Plan promises a redesigned blueprint for player and coach education.","LONDON: The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) on Friday released a 12-point action plan to tackle racism and discrimination in the sport, including a review of the  “dressing room culture” across teams and a standardised approach to whistleblowing.
The move comes after a number of players, including former Yorkshire spinner Azeem Rafiq, alleged they were the victims of institutional racism at their clubs.
The Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) Action Plan promises a redesigned blueprint for player and coach education, as well as a mentoring programme for cricketers from diverse or underprivileged backgrounds.
Teams will also be required to diversify their leadership boards by April 2022, with a commitment to have 30% female and representative ethnicity.
“We have now set out a series of game-wide commitments so that cricket can start to make the transformation that we know is needed,” ECB interim chair Barry O’Brien said.
The ECB said it would set up a new anti-discrimination unit within sixth months and also vowed to remove  “structural and cultural barriers” in their elite talent pathways.

4,‘International participation key to improving Pakistan hockey’,"“We have the talent but we need to make a lot of efforts to help the game,” he says.","LAHORE: Pakistan Hockey Federation secretary Asif Bajwa on Friday said that the national team wouldn’t improve without featuring in international events while adding that government patronage is essential to help Pakistan regain its standing in the global game.
“We have the talent but we need to make a lot of efforts to help the game,” Bajwa said while addressing the Lahore Press Club. “Sport always needs the help of government to flourish and that remains key to us achieving our targets.”
Yet again, Bajwa lamented Pakistan’s inability to participate in the 2019 FIH Pro League after the government refused to grant funding to the team. It also meant Pakistan were unable to take part in the next season of the league last year as well as the ongoing third edition.
“Missing the inaugural edition meant our ranking slipped and we haven’t been able to regain that,” said Bajwa.
“Then, the Covid-19 pandemic put a stop to international activity.
“We are now slowly and gradually returning to the international fold with our team participating in the FIH Junior World Cup in India and we need to ensure more participation to go forward.”

5,Cummins tasked with healing Australia after time of Paine,"MELBOURNE: After a week of speculation, fast bowler Pat Cummins was confirmed as Australia’s 47th Test captain on...","MELBOURNE: After a week of speculation, fast bowler Pat Cummins was confirmed as Australia’s 47th Test captain on Friday, tasked with galvanising the team at short order before the Ashes amid the fall-out from Tim Paine’s resignation and decision to take a break from cricket.
Cummins will be supported by new vice-captain Steve Smith, who returns to a formal leadership role for the first time since losing the captaincy during the Newlands ball-tampering scandal in 2018. 
As former skipper Paine’s vice-captain, Cummins was considered a shoo-in to replace the wicket-keeper, who on Friday stepped away from all cricket to take a “mental health break” after damaging revelations of a ‘sexting’ scandal. 
However, the appointment is still remarkable given that Australia has almost always favoured batsmen as captains.
Cummins becomes only the second fast bowler to captain the side after Ray Lindwall, who led for one Test against India in the mid-1950s. 
“There’s a couple of more unknowns about having a bowling captain and that’s why I think from the outset I was absolutely determined if I was captain to have someone like Steve as vice-captain next to me,” Cummins told reporters from the team’s Gold Coast base. 
“I feel like I’ve got quite a lot of experience to draw on. I think a lot of the problems or potential issues around being a fast bowling captain, hopefully — I’m sure we’ll be able to work through.” 
Popular, telegenic and amiable in public, Cummins becomes captain a decade after his sensational Test debut as an 18-year-old, when he took a seven-wicket match haul at the Wanderers to help beat South Africa. 
He had to wait nearly six years for his next Test due to injuries but now tops the world’s test bowling rankings. 
The appointment of Cummins was hailed by former players and pundits but Smith’s promotion, coming three years after ‘Sandpaper-gate’, did not sit well with some. 
Smith served a 12-month ban from internationals and a two-year ban from leadership roles completed last year. 
Former spinner Shane Warne was completely opposed to Smith’s promotion, saying it would invite ridicule. “We need to go into the Ashes now with a clean slate, not open up old wounds,” Warne wrote in a column for News Corp. 
Smith, sitting beside Cummins in a white team polo shirt, said he understood there would be “negativity”. 
“But for me, I know that I’ve grown a great deal over the last three or four years,” he said. “I’m a more rounded individual, and in turn, I think it’s turned me into a better leader. I’m excited to be in this position next to Patrick.” 
One of the duo’s first tasks will be to help selectors pick a wicketkeeper before the Ashes opener in Brisbane on Dec 8. 
The uncapped duo of Alex Carey and Josh Inglis, along with Matthew Wade, have been touted as potential replacements for Paine, whose international future is now in doubt. 
From there, Cummins and Smith will need to work out quickly how they operate together on the field. 
While taking the captaincy quicker than planned, Cummins has served something of an apprenticeship as New South Wales skipper in the domestic one-day competition. 
Like Paine, who succeeded Smith after the Newlands scandal, Cummins has been described as a “cleanskin” in the media, a poster boy who can help Australia move on from scandal. 
Cummins said he was not entirely comfortable with such titles. 
“I think that’s probably really hit home in the last few days, seeing Tim [Paine],” said Cummins. “A lot of the pressure and the responsibility of being perfect is unreasonable. I think it’s too much to ask of anyone. I think we’ve got to be a bit kinder and a bit more a bit more understanding at times.” 
On a dramatic day for Australian cricket, Cummins’ appointment came hours after it was announced that former captain Paine will take a break from the sport, ruling him out of the Ashes. 
Cricket Tasmania said that the 36-year-old Paine would immediately leave all forms of the game for the “foreseeable future”. 
His decision to step out of the limelight altogether put an abrupt end to fierce debate in Australia over whether he should take part in the Ashes. 
“Following discussions over the last 24 hours, Tim Paine has advised Cricket Tasmania that he will be taking a leave of absence from all forms of cricket for the foreseeable future,” Cricket Tasmania said in a statement. 
While stepping down as skipper, Paine said at the time he wanted to remain a “committed member” of the Australian Test side and was looking forward to facing England. 
There had been a groundswell of support in the Australian changing room for Paine to remain in the Ashes side. 
Cummins and Smith said that he was very much in their thoughts. 
“We really feel for him and his family,” said Cummins. “He’s a well-loved and respected figure of our team. We love him and hope to see him back in the team soon.”

Holders Spain suffered a blow to their title defence before hitting a ball in anger with Carlos Alcaraz in quarantine after testing positive for Covid-19.
The rest of the Spanish team, who are missing Rafael Nadal, were given the all-clear after PCR tests to play Ecuador in Madrid on Friday.
Sweden were in imperious form in the Spanish capital against the Canadian 2019 finalists who went into battle without their top two players Felix Auger-Aliassime and Denis Shapovalov. Elias Ymer, 25, got the show on the road, beating Steven Diez 6-4, 6-2 before his two-year younger sibling Mikael sped past Vasek Pospisil 6-4, 6-4.
Robert Lindstedt and Andre Goransson then combined for a 7-6, 6-4 doubles win over Pospisil and Brayden Schnur to leave the Swedes needing a win over Kazakhstan on Saturday to progress to the quarter-finals for the first time since 2011.

France then came back as Adrian Mannarino beat Jiri Vesely 6-7 (1-7), 6-4, 6-2.
And Nicolas Mahut and Pierre-Hugues Herbert completed the comeback with a three-set defeat of Jiri Lehecka and Machac.

Amadej Marosa scored for Mura four minutes into stoppage time in Maribor, finishing off a quick counterattack with a shot that was deflected and looped into the net. It was a big blow for new Tottenham manager Antonio Conte, whose team now likely need a win over group winners Rennes in the last round to have a chance of advancing. 
“This is a bad loss for us,” Conte said. “The performance was poor. We know we have a lot of work ahead of us. We were poor not only technically and tactically but also mentally. 
“Someone [might] think that a new coach arrives and Conte won in the past and then I am a magician. But the only magic I can do is to work. To bring work and work to improve, to bring my methods, my ideas of football. But we have to understand that we need time.” 
In the same competition, Jose Mourinho’s AS Roma routed Zorya Luhansk 4-0 at Stadio Olimpico to stay in contention for the first place in Group ‘C’. 
LASK, Gent and Alkmaar also made the next round. 
In the Europa League, Leicester City beat Legia Warsaw 3-1 to leap from bottom to top of Group ‘C’ and keep alive their hopes of reaching the knockout stages. 
West Ham clinched top spot in Group ‘H’ with a game to spare with a 2-0 victory at Rapid Vienna. Bayer Leverkusen also sealed a place in the next round after coming back from 2-1 down to beat Celtic 3-2 in Group ‘G’. 
Giovanni Van Bronckhorst got off to a perfect start as Rangers manager as a 2-0 win over Sparta Prague secured their place in the last 32.   
Real Betis, Lazio, Monaco, Galatasaray and Olympiakos also qualified for the knockout stages. 
Only the eight group winners go straight into the round of 16 the runners-up enter playoffs with the eight teams who finish in third place in the Champions League groups. 
A similar system operates for the third-place Europa League teams dropping down into the Europa Conference League. 
Mura had lost their first four group games but went ahead in the 11th minute when Tomi Horvat scored into the roof of the net. Tottenham, one of the big favourites to win the first edition of the competition, then had Ryan Sessegnon sent off in the 32nd with a second yellow card. 
Harry Kane equalised from a narrow angle in the 72nd but Tottenham then needlessly gave Mura the chance to counter in the final seconds. 
Rennes won Group ‘G’ with 11 points after a 3-3 draw against Vitesse Arnhem, who are tied with Tottenham on seven. 
Cyriel Desser’s scored his second goal in stoppage time to secure a 2-2 draw for Feyenoord at Slavia Prague, which was enough for the Dutch side to clinch first place in Group ‘E’. 
Copenhagen topped Group F after routing Gibraltar’s Lincoln Red Imps 4-0. 
First-half goals from Carles Perez and Nicolo Zaniolo gave Roma a comfortable cushion in the first half before Jordan Veretout missed a golden opportunity to make it 3-0 from the spot. Tammy Abraham added two more goals in the second, including one from an overhead kick.

The overnight leader, though, made sure that didn’t happen. Minhaj fired five birdies in a three-under 69 and leads the inaugural edition of the championship at its halfway point at nine-under 135.
Four shots adrift are two of the country’s top golfers — Shabbir Iqbal (70) and Matloob Ahmed, who hit seven birdies in a stunning six-under 66. 
Sunny Masih’s second successive round of 70 sees him a stroke further adrift at 140, one ahead of Waheed Baloch (70) and Dilshad Ali (71). 
The country’s latest golf sensation Ahmed Baig (69) is at 142 alongside Mohammad Zubair (70). They are a shot ahead of Arif Ali (69), Mohammad Shahzad (69) and Mohammad Imran (72). 
Mohammad Tariq (72) and Mohammad Alam (70) are at even-par after two rounds while Mohammad Munir, another of Pakistan’s top golfing stars, finds himself at one-over after firing seven birdies for a 66 to rebound from a disastrous first-round 79.

13,"Italy, Portugal on collision course in World Cup playoffs","ZURICH: The last two European champions, Italy and Portugal, could meet for a spot at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar...","ZURICH: The last two European champions, Italy and Portugal, could meet for a spot at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar after they were drawn on Friday in the same path for the playoffs. 
The 12 teams — 10 of which finished runners-up in their groups — were split into three four-team paths, each with its own semi-finals and final.
Seeded teams were guaranteed a home game in the semi-finals. 
The winning team from each path qualifies for the World Cup in Qatar, meaning Italy and Portugal cannot both reach the tournament.
Italy, who won the Euros earlier this year, and 2016 European champions Portugal will play their semi-final games at home against North Macedonia and Turkey, respectively. 
Should the two heavyweights advance, Portugal will have home advantage in the final. 
“It could have been a little better, for sure.” Italy coach Roberto Mancini told RAI2. “We are confident and positive, especially in the more difficult moments. 
“As we would have gladly avoided them [Portugal], probably they too would have avoided us. We will have to play a great match [against North Macedonia], then we will see in the final.” 
Italy — who beat England on penalties in the Euro 2020 final earlier this year — are hoping to banish the memories of their play-off heartache from four years ago when they lost to Sweden and failed to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1958. 
Portugal have featured at every major championship since missing out on the 1998 World Cup. 
Wales, who are looking to make their first World Cup in 64 years, were drawn in the same path as Scotland, who have not qualified since 1998. 
“We’ve given ourselves a great opportunity. We’ve worked ever so hard to finish second and get that home draw. We’ve got everything to play for,” Wales manager Robert Page told the BBC. 
Older Wales fans still get high blood pressure thinking about the 1977 World Cup qualifier with Scotland. 
Played at Liverpool’s Anfield stadium, the Scots took the lead with a penalty awarded for handball even though replays showed it was Scotland striker Joe Jordan who handled. 
Scotland won 2-0 to earn a place at the World Cup in Argentina the following year. 
Eight years later, Scotland earned a vital draw in Cardiff to book a place at Mexico ‘86, but the celebrations were cut short after manager Jock Stein suffered a heart-attack on the touchline and died in the changing rooms shortly afterwards. 
Scotland will welcome Ukraine to Glasgow in their semi-final game. Wales take on Austria in Cardiff, with the winners to have home advantage in the final.
Russia will host Poland for the right to face Sweden or the Czech Republic in their bracket final. Russia or Poland will host the final. 
The Russians, who reached the 2018 quarter-finals as the host nation, have only ever lost one World Cup qualifier at home — against Germany in 2009. 
The six playoff semifinals will be played as single-leg elimination games March 24. The three finals are played five days later. 
The three winners will complete Europes entry of 13 nations in the 32-team lineup in Qatar. 
FIFA will make the tournament draw on April 1 in Doha. 
FIFA also held the draw for the intercontinental playoffs where the Asian qualifier will play a team from South America while one from the CONCACAF region faces Oceania’s qualifier. 
European Playoff Draw (Home side first): 
Path ‘A’; Scotland v Ukraine, Wales v Austria 
Path ‘B’: Russia v Poland, Sweden v Czech Republic 
Path ‘C’: Italy v North Macedonia, Portugal v Turkey. 
Intercontinental Playoff Draw: AFC team v CONMEBOL team, CONCACAF team v OFC team.
