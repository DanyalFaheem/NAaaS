0,Commercial use of military land annoys CJP,SC seeks report on decisions of all services chiefs on the matter,"KARACHI: The Supreme Court on Friday lashed out at the defence secretary over commercial activities and construction of housing societies on cantonment land and summoned him along with a report carrying details of decisions of all services chiefs on the matter.
Headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Justice Gulzar Ahmed, the three-member bench took up the matter pertaining to alleged conversion of cantonment land in violation of relevant laws for hearing.

SC seeks report on decisions of all services chiefs on the matter

While replying to a query of the bench that also comprised Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Qazi Mohammad Amin Ahmed, Defence Secretary retired Lt Gen Mian Mohammad Hilal Hussain said such land was allotted for the purpose of defence strategic objectives. He contended that there were policies, rules and regulations for cantonment and military land when the apex court confronted him how housing societies had been made on such land.
At this juncture, Justice Amin said such policies were under the command of this court while the CJP remarked that cinema halls, wedding halls and other commercial activities were also being carried out on cantonment land and there was no such provision in the Constitution.
The chief justice said such activities needed to be stopped, land retrieved and used for defence purpose. He then asked the secretary how he was going to roll these things back.
The secretary said that he would make efforts in this regard and requested the court for some time. At this point, the CJP told the secretary that he was sitting in Islamabad whereas majors and colonels in the financial capital were acting like kings and could do anything despite court orders.
The bench observed they were making mockery of court orders passed about commercialisation of the land meant for defence purposes.
Justice Ashan asked retired Lt Gen Hussain that he would have to come up with a proper strategy and time frame to fix such issues.
The defence secretary apprised the bench that the air force, navy and army chiefs had decided not to allow further commercial activities on cantonment land. The CJP asked him that all the cantonment boards must also be informed about such decisions. He also directed him to appear along with a report as well as copies of decisions/minutes of meetings made by the armed forces chiefs about cantonment land.
The chief justice remarked that commercial and residential activities were being carried out at the Masroor Base, Cantonment Board Faisal and in the jurisdictions of other cantonment boards of the city while the Korangi Creek Airbase has almost been closed.
All Askari housing societies had also been built on cantonment lands in the metropolis, he observed.
The court also directed the defence secretary to consult the attorney general, who did not turn up on Friday, and appear in person before the bench in Islamabad on Tuesday.
Earlier on Wednesday, the apex court observed that the conversion of cantonment land into private land in Karachi seemed to be contrary to very mandate of the Cantonment Act, 1924 and the Land Administration Control Rules, 1937 and also was in violation of various provisions of the Constitution and summoned the defence secretary and attorney general for Nov 26. “If any law or rule is made contrary to such mandate, the same will be ultra virus the act and the constitution and therefore, this aspect needs to be heard and decided by this court,” the bench observed.
It said the land meant for cantonment purposes were progressively being used rather allotted, leased and transferred by the cantonment authorities to the personnel of armed forces for their own personal use (i.e. construction of houses, commercial buildings and other related things).

1,PTA to cut mobile termination rates from Jan 1,Officials say the decision will offer more flexibility to cellular operators to introduce new bundles for consumers.,"ISLAMABAD: The Pak­istan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) has reduced the mobile termination rate (MTR) from Rs0.70 per minute to Rs0.50 with effect from Jan 1, 2022, an official statement said on Friday.  
MTR — the price a cellular operator charges from another operator for terminating off-net calls — will be further reduced to Rs0.40 per minute from July 1 next year, the telecom regulator said. 
According to PTA officials, the reduction in MTR will directly or indirectly benefit callers in that it will offer more flexibility to operators to introduce new bundles for consumers.
While the PTA claims that the decision has been made after thorough consultation with the telecom industry, some industry players have opposed the move. They argue that the reduction would affect the telecom industry’s efforts to improve the quality of service and coverage across the country, causing a potential loss of around Rs8-10 billion to the industry. 
“The callers are not aware of wholesale termination charges which are settled among the operators. Higher termination charges tend to favour larger players as compared to smaller operators,” a PTA official said, adding that it was the regulator’s responsibility to provide a level playing field. 
The PTA believes that lowering MTR would allow more competitive and innovative offerings, such as free off-net minute bundles, for consumers. Besides, it is expected to make the market healthier and beneficial in terms of lower tariffs on off-net calls.  
In July, the PTA issued a consultation paper in which it noted that an MTR of Rs0.70 per minute in Pakistan was still higher than the benchmarking results of the MTR determination of 2018 and the MTRs prevailing in regional countries. 
The regulator said it had also received requests from telecom operators to review the existing mobile termination rates. 
After industry hearing and thorough analysis, the PTA has determined the MTR for all types of calls — including local, long distance, and international incoming calls — terminated on mobile networks from other mobile networks or fixed networks in Pakistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, to be Rs0.50 per minute from January to June 2022, Re0.40 per minute from July 2022 to June 2023, and Rs0.30 per minute from July 2023 onwards.  
On the other hand, those who opposed the reduction in MTR maintain that the rate in Pakistan was already among the lowest in the world. 
One industry player feared that lowering MTR will further deflate the telecom market amid record inflation and currency devaluation.

2,"IHC dismisses contempt plea against Maryam, Abbasi",ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Friday dismissed a petition...,"• Justice Minallah observes contempt law cannot be invoked for the sake of a retired judge
• NA panel’s chair summons former CJP, Rana Shamim, others     
ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Friday dismissed a petition seeking contempt of court proceedings against Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) vice president Maryam Nawaz and former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi for criticising former chief justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar.  
IHC Chief Justice Athar Mina­llah during a brief hearing on the petition remarked that the former chief justice of Pakistan may file a suit with an appropriate forum for redressal of his grievances.  
He observed that the contempt law could not be invoked for the sake of a retired judge.  
The petition was filed by local lawyer Kulsum Khaliq under Article 204 of the Constitution read with sections 3 and 4 of the Contempt of Court Ordinance, 2003.  
The petitioner has requested that contempt proceedings be initiated against the respondents. She argued that both the PML-N leaders had attempted to scandalise the former chief justice.  
When the court asked the petitioner whether the respondents had said anything against the IHC or its judges calculated to interfere with the due administration of justice or to prejudice pending proceedings, she replied in the negative.  
The court noted that it had highlighted the principles and law regarding contempt in the Firdaus Ashiq Awan case.  
The IHC chief justice observed that there is no cavil to the proposition that judges are not above the law and they are accountable. Bona fide criticism is an integral part of the accountability of judicial officers.  
The scope of contempt has been aptly described by Lord Atkin in the judgement of the House of Lords titled “Ambard v. Attorney-General for Trinidad and Tobago”, [1936].  
The court order reproduced the excerpt of the judgement as: “But whether the authority and position of an individual Judge or the due administration of justice is concerned, no wrong is committed by any member of the public who exercises the ordinary right of criticising in good faith in private or public act done in the seat of justice. The path of criticism is a public way: the wrongheaded are permitted to err therein: provided that members of the public abstain from imputing improper motives to those taking part in the administration of justice, and are genuinely exercising a right of criticism, and not acting in malice or attempting to impair the administration of justice, they are immune. Justice is not a cloistered virtue: she must be allowed to suffer the scrutiny and respectful even though outspoken comments of ordinary men.” 
Justice Minallah stated that a judge who ceases to hold a judicial office upon retirement instantly severs his or her connection with the judicial organ and the courts. A judge after retirement, therefore, attains the status of a private citizen. Such a person is no more a member of the ‘court’ in the context of Article 204 of the Constitution or under the Ordinance of 2003. 
However, a judicial officer, after his retirement, is not without a remedy in case the latter considers to have been maligned or his respect lowered in the eyes of the people. As a private citizen it remains open to a retired judicial officer to seek remedies available in a court of law. However, the offence of contempt is not attracted in the case of a retired judge because after retirement the latter attains the status of a private citizen, said the IHC chief justice. 
“It is emphasised that even otherwise, the power of contempt is exercised sparingly. It is not a power meant to protect a judge as an individual nor the latter’s dignity. Judges are entrusted with an onerous duty to serve the people through the fountain of justice and they are, therefore, not immune from public scrutiny nor criticism,” the court order stated, adding: “An independent judge would not be influenced nor affected in any other manner because of public criticism.” 
The court order stated that the authority of a judge is not dependent on the words of the Constitution but, rather, rests on public respect and the confidence of the people. 
Being magnanimous is an essential attribute of an independent and impartial judge because of the exalted position and the divine nature of judicial functions, it added. 
The court declared the petition as not maintainable and dismissed it, observing: “In the case in hand, the petitioner seems to be hurt because a former chief justice of Pakistan has been publicly criticised in his individual capacity. This definitely does not attract the offence of contempt.”

3,Centre to launch uplift projects in 14 Sindh districts,Federal ministers hold provincial govt responsible for food inflation.,"• PM says past govts ignored development of the province
• Federal ministers hold provincial govt responsible for food inflation
• PPP spokesperson says Sindh is the only province providing free treatment for cancer, heart and kidney ailments      
ISLAMABAD: The federal government on Friday criticised the Sindh government for ‘poor governance’ with ministers holding it responsible for food inflation in the country, as Prime Minister Imran Khan claimed the Centre would uplift 14 districts under the Rs444 billion Sindh Development Plan. 
Minister for Food Security Khusro Bakhtiyar said Sindh was the hub of fertiliser hoarders, whereas Minister of State for Information Farrukh Habib and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Youth Affairs Usman Dar in a press conference condemned the Sindh government for food inflation. 
However, Pakistan Peoples Party that rules Sindh slammed the federal government for criticising the provincial government. 
While chairing a meeting to review implementation of the development plan, the prime minister said the federal government would prioritise uplift of 14 Sindh districts. 
The meeting was attended by federal ministers Dr Fehmida Mirza, Asad Umar, Hammad Azhar and senior officials. 
Mr Khan said the objective was to improve socio-economic status of residents of the province. He directed that priority be given to less developed and rural areas of Sindh to ensure prosperity. He regretted that the previous governments had ignored the development of Sindh. 
While calling for transparency, quality of work and adherence to timelines while implementing the development plan, the PM asked the relevant departments to fast-track work on Hyderabad-Sukkur Motorway and construction of sports complexes in Badin, Ghotki, Thar, Mirpurkhas, Tando Mohammad Khan, Hyderabad and Sanghar. 
The development plan includes projects related to roads and motorways, housing, information technology and telecom, water resources, health, higher education, vocational training, disaster management, railways, energy and establishment of sports facilities. 
The meeting was informed that the Sindh Development Plan comprised 48 Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) projects, 50 non-PSDP projects and seven public-private partnership projects. 
The government approved 26 new PSDP projects and allocated financial resources for the fiscal year 2021-22. The Planning Commission had authorised Rs16.304 billion for eight federal government divisions and organisations. 
Meanwhile, the state minister for information blamed the Sindh government for rise in food inflation in the country, alleging that the “Sindh government has left the people of the province at the mercy of mafias”. 
He said when sugar price went up to Rs150 per kilo, the Sindh government stopped supplying sugar cane to mills and later blocked stocks of sugar from reaching the markets. He said prices of food and grocery items were still higher in Sindh as compared to other provinces. 
In response to the criticism, PPP spokesman Faisal Karim Kundi wondered: “Why does Imran Khan worry so much about Sindh?” 
He claimed that Sindh was the only province where free treatment was being given for cancer, heart ailments, liver and kidney ailments. 
Mr Kundi said the biggest trauma centre of the country was also functioning in Sindh. “If nothing is being done in Sindh, then why do people from across the country travel to Sindh to avail free medical treatment,” he questioned.

4,Lower Dir judge arrested for raping woman at official residence,PHC suspends senior civil judge,"PESHAWAR: Police in Lower Dir district have arrested a senior civil judge on the charge of sexually assaulting a woman at his official residence. 
The incident took place on Thursday when the woman, a resident of Nishtarabad area of Peshawar, approached Balambat police station with the complaint of sexual assault against senior civil judge Jamshed Kundi. 
Police said that initial medical examination of the woman confirmed the occurrence of sexual assault. 
Judge Kundi was arrested and later presented before a local court on Friday, which granted his one-day physical remand to police. Police had asked for three-day remand. 
Meanwhile, the registrar of the Peshawar High Court (PHC) said in a statement: “Mr Jamshed Kundi, senior civil judge, Dir Lower, on being charged in case FIR No. 187 registered with police station Balambat has been suspended with immediate effect.” 

PHC suspends senior civil judge

The statement said that the law would take its course be it anybody accused of an offence. “Peshawar High Court will continue to strive to uphold the rule of law,” it added. 
According to the FIR, the complainant told police that the judge had asked for Rs1.5 million bribe for providing a job to her sister three months ago. As she did not have that amount, she gave the judge her jewellery valued at Rs1.5m. 
“The judge contacted me on Thursday and said he was unable to secure job for my sister,” she said, adding that the judge asked her to accompany him to Lower Dir to collect the jewellery. 
She said that she travelled to Lower Dir from Peshawar in the judge’s official vehicle. 
After reaching his official residence, located in Balambat Colony, Kundi told her that he would return her jewellery only if she agreed to have sex with him, the complainant said. On her refusal, the judge sexually assaulted her. 
Police sent the woman to Timargarah hospital for her medical examination. 
Police have booked Kundi under section 376 of the Pakistan Penal Code. 
The District Bar Association of Lower Dir, through a resolution, has demanded an inquiry into the incident through a judicial commission headed by a judge of the PHC to unearth the facts. 
The resolution said that the incident was reported to police at around 1:40pm but the FIR was registered at 8:40pm after medical examination of the victim was conducted. This suggested that police have acted under pressure of unknown elements by delaying registration of the FIR for considerable time, which necessitates an impartial inquiry. 
The resolution said that since the issue was directly related with the confidence of citizens in the courts, it must be thoroughly examined by an independent inquiry commission.

6,"Inflation, not poverty, is real issue: Shaukat Tarin","Rubbishes claim of mini-budget, asserts only some tax exemptions to be withdrawn.","KARACHI: Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance and Revenue Shaukat Tarin downplayed on Friday the incidence of poverty in Pakistan while insisting that its rate has gone down recently.
Speaking to journalists at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), Mr Tarin said the latest figures by the World Bank show the incidence of poverty dropped to 4.2 per cent from 5.4pc a year ago. “Our problem is inflation, which has affected the lower middle class in urban areas the worst,” he said.
The adviser said the rural areas were thriving as bumper crops brought prosperity there and led to ‘record sales of motorcycles’. He also believed the middle and upper classes were doing well. 
“Restaurants are full of people. Cars are getting expensive,” he remarked.
Repeating his statement from two weeks ago, Mr Tarin again warned speculators in the foreign exchange market not to play with fire. “I warn speculators: the rupee will swing the other way too. We’re taking some actions that will change the direction [of the exchange rate movement].” He also reiterated his claim that the rupee was undervalued by roughly Rs10. 

Rubbishes claim of mini-budget, asserts only some tax exemptions to be withdrawn

Although the exchange rate hovered above Rs178 in the open market on Friday, the finance adviser insisted that its actual value should be Rs165 to Rs167 as per the real effective exchange rate, a technical measure that compares the value of a nation’s currency against the weighted average of the currencies of its major trading partners.
Tax exemptions to be withdrawn
He took exception to a reporter’s question about the impending ‘mini-budget’ to formalise the policy measures being taken under the soon-to-be-resumed loan programme by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). “Don’t sensationalise. There’s no mini-budget. Some [tax] exemptions will be withdrawn.”
Mr Tarin said he stood his ground and refused to impose new taxes though the country’s economic team — under the preceding finance adviser — had signed up for “exemptions and new taxes” worth Rs700 billion in its negotiations held in March this year.
He said he agreed in principle with the IMF’s argument against tax exemptions. “What’s the point in distorting the system by charging different rates of sales tax?” he said, noting that incentives should rather be in the shape of targeted subsidies.
Non-productive investment
The finance adviser vowed to introduce a “certain scheme of taxes” mainly for the real estate sector so that non-productive investment “can be recycled to the other sectors of the economy”.
In his speech to mark the maiden listing on the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) board, which is a separate counter of the PSX reserved for high-risk small and medium enterprises (SMEs), Mr Tarin said benefits to the real estate sector must be aligned with those extended to other productive sectors of the economy. “We do see an anomaly in the real estate sector when plots of land are bought and are held for years. That’s productive capital sunk,” he said.
He called for developing capital markets to ensure easy access of SMEs to funds in both debt and equity forms.
“SMEs are too reliant on the banking sector for funding needs. But even the footprint of banks on GDP is just 33pc. Lending [as a percentage of deposits] is just 42pc. This means only 15pc of GDP is supported by banks,” he said.
Later on, the finance adviser visited the office of the Pakistan Banks’ Association (PBA), according to a press release. It said the PBA conveyed its concerns to Mr Tarin about the continuing ‘wide disparity’ between the lower tax rates on profit/dividends from investment in shares listed on the stock market as well as units of mutual funds and the tax rates on profit from bank deposits classified as ‘profit on debt’.
Regarding PBA’s concerns related to disparity in the tax rate on banks and tax rate on the corporate sector besides the continuation of the super tax on banks, Mr Tarin “understood and agreed with the PBA” and promised to look into the matter, the statement added.
According to a separate press release by the Central Depository Company (CDC), Mr Tarin inaugurated the country’s first Professional Clearing Member (PCM) at the CDC House. The introduction of the PCM regime is aimed at minimising the risk of custody defaults by transferring custody of shares to the PCM, it added.
