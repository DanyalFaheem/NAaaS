0,"Exports, imports see record rise in 1QFY22","External debt shows slowest build-up in last five years, says ministry report.","KARACHI: Exports and imports both reached the highest-ever level in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021-22 (1QFY22) which convinced the government to achieve 5.5 per cent economic growth, said a report issued by the Ministry of Planning and Development on Friday.  
“Growth responsiveness to stimulus package is more than anticipated and thus the economy is likely to surpass the annual growth target by a fair margin likely in the range of 5-5.5pc,” the First Quarterly Economic Review for FY22 said. The government has set 4.8pc growth target in the budget for FY22.  
“The growth rates are indicative signs of continued economic growth. However, the structural problems of balance of payments constrained growth have rapidly become more pronounced as imports surged to highest ever level in tandem with rising aggregate demand,” said the report.  
The review noted that at a time when the developing world is grappled with rising debts, Pakistan’s external debt recorded its slowest build-up in last five years. 

External debt shows slowest build-up in last five years, says ministry report  

Exports recorded highest ever average monthly level of $2.4 billion in 1QFY22 as well as highest ever in a single quarter at $7.2bn on shipment basis. 
Exports of services sector fetched highest value in 1QFY22 since 2016; however, if government services are excluded, then it is the highest-ever. 
“However, government services accounted for more than 50pc of services exports during 2013 to 2016 which has now reduced to just 13pc in 1QFY22,” the review said.  
Imports again surged to their highest-ever level in single quarter at $17.5bn and recorded 64.3pc growth during 1QFY22 to cater for growing economic activities in the country, said the report.  
“Import of textile machinery surged by 144pc and textile group imports surged by 76pc,” it said. 
Foreign investment inflows (net) went up by 323pc during 1QFY22 compared to the last year. Portfolio inflows increased to $880 million compared to net outflow of $146m in the comparable period, said the report. 
Credit to private business has witnessed phenomenal increase of 318pc in the 1QFY22 to Rs190bn as against net retirement of Rs87bn in the corresponding period of last year, said the report. “This reflects signs of increasing economic activity in the country,” said the report. 
The report noted that FY22 started off with positive prospects for economic growth revival as industrial and services sector activity picked up and agriculture sector performance looked impressive as far as first estimate of Kharif crop is concerned.  
Cotton picking has started since month of August and data shared by the Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association (PCGA) shows highly encouraging trend of cotton arrivals, the report said. PCGA data for October 15, shows that cotton arrivals till date are 93.7pc higher than the corresponding month of last year, it added.  
Sugarcane output may increase this year mainly due to increase in crop area, ample water availability, effective and timely crop management activities because of higher sugar price and better sugarcane procurement price in the market, the report said. 
Reviewing the industrial sector, the report said 24pc growth in oil sales was reported by the Oil Marketing Companies. “112pc growth in production of cars shows phenomenal economic activity during the 1QFY22 in the manufacturing sector,” it added.  
Aggregate demand pressures are evident from 84pc rise in car sales in the 1QFY22, 65pc increase in imports and massive spike in demand for consumer credits, it said.  
Demand of high-speed diesel has increased by 26pc whilst petrol consumption has risen by 14pc and electricity consumption rose by 13pc during 1QFY22, the report added.

1,Refinance schemes hinder stock listings: Shamshad Akhtar,Shaukatv Tarin acknowledges subsidised loans create distortions.,"KARACHI: Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) Chairperson Dr Shamshad Akhtar urged the government on Friday to do away with refinance schemes in order to promote capital markets.
The federal government provides industrialists with subsidised loans through the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), which help them grow their production and export earnings. However, refinance schemes also turn away growing businesses from the capital markets — the traditional avenue for raising funds by selling shares and debt instruments to the general public.
Dr Akhtar, who previously served as SBP governor, said such schemes create a distortion in the economy and deter companies from getting listed on the stock exchange.
Currently, the SBP is offering multiple schemes for export financing, long-term financing, SME financing, renewable energy financing, storage of agricultural produce financing, modernisation of SMEs financing and home financing.

Tarin acknowledges subsidised loans create distortions

“The government needs to scale down these schemes,” she said while addressing a ceremony to mark the beginning of trading in Pak Agro Packaging Ltd, the first small and medium enterprise (SME) that’s been listed on the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) board of the PSX.
The SBP aggressively promoted its refinance schemes in the immediate aftermath of Covid-19 to minimise the pandemic’s economic impact. For example, approved financing under the Temporary Economic Refinance Facility — aimed at promoting new investment and expansion and/or Balancing, Modernisation and Replacement — amounted to Rs436 billion at the end of its maturity on March 31.
Similarly, subsidised loans approved for hospitals amounted to Rs17.8bn at the end of June 30. “I understand that the country needed some cushion during Covid-19. But such schemes distort the financial flows to the capital markets,” she said.
Responding to Dr Akhtar’s comments, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance and Revenue Shaukat Tarin acknowledged refinance schemes indeed create market distortions. However, he said all developing economies encourage such policies to enhance their industrial output and export earnings.
“Our competitors are also incentivising their exporters. We have to match their incentives,” he said, noting that the government may “rationalise” these schemes going forward. “But we won’t do it in a knee-jerk fashion.”
Speaking on the occasion, PSX Managing Director Farrukh H. Khan said investors face a “tax-driven distortion” in the returns of different asset classes, which is hindering the efficient allocation of resources.
He said the number of stock market investors is now increasing after flat-lining for five years. “So far in this fiscal year, we’ve had four main-board listings and two GEM listings,” he said while demanding that the government should restore the tax credit for the newly listed entities.

2,"PPRA rules not ideal for RLNG imports, Senate panel told",Committee chairman assures Petroleum Division of sending recommendations to finance ministry over the matter.,"ISLAMABAD: The Senate Standing Committee on Petroleum was told on Friday that the Public  Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) rules were not ideal for on-spot  procurement of re-gasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) supplies and they need to be amended. 
Briefing the committee, Secretary Petroleum Dr Arshad Mehmood said allowing the private sector to import RLNG was difficult due to several bottlenecks in the system.
He added that there were numerous legal, commercial/financial, operational and technical issues that need to be addressed for Third Party Access (TPA) to the private sector with regard to the use of LNG terminals.
Committee chairman Senator Abdul Qadir inquired about the reasons for not allowing the private sector to import RLNG.
The secretary petroleum said that there were issues related to limited pipeline capacity and challenges in allocation of pipeline capacity from Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd and Sui Northern Gas Company Ltd and the Port Qasim Authority’s ability to handle numbers of LNG vessels and night navigation for LNG vessels.
He, however, added that the private sector was engaged in development of two more LNG terminals, and the Petroleum Division was also working on a new LNG policy for an improved regulatory framework with special focus on private sector participation in the LNG sector.
Regarding amendments to the PPRA rules, the standing committee chairman assured the Petroleum Division of sending recommendations to the finance ministry over the matter.
Responding to the queries by the senators regarding market liberalisation in the LNG sector, the secretary petroleum said that the government was focusing on private sector participation in the LNG supply chain, development of new LNG import terminals in the private sector, third-party access to LNG terminals and pipeline network, construction of new gas pipeline from Karachi to Lahore, development of gas storage and an LNG virtual pipeline.
Mr Mehmood informed the committee that the TPA rules and network codes have been developed to provide access to pipeline network to the private sector investors.
“We have laid 1,100km-long 42-inch RLNG pipeline, while the planning for another RLNG pipeline was at an advanced stage to transport the imported gas from the upcoming LNG plants in Karachi to the upcountry consumers,” Dr Mehmood said.
The committee members also asked about the Saudi government’s pledge of  investing $14 billion in setting up an oil refinery, Dr Mehmood said  that Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco) and companies from UAE and  China have shown interest in such projects after the approval of  Refineries Policy 2021, which offers incentivised internal rate of  return.
While discussing the problems faced by people of Quetta, Ziarat and other areas where the temperature reaches below freezing point during winter, the chairman committee said that power consumers in those areas should not be charged higher slab rates as their consumption is high only during winter.

3,Sindh a urea hoarding hub: Khusro Bakhtyar,"Sales of urea in Sindh have surged 52pc to 360,520 tonnes over the last season, meeting told.","ISLAMABAD: Federal Minister for Industries and Production Makhdum Khu­sro Bakhtyar on Friday said the province of Sindh had become a safe haven for fertiliser hoarders and profiteers.
The minister made these remarks while chairing a meeting to review the urea supply situation in the country. The fertiliser industry also shared the latest position of urea supply through a real time portal which showed inter-provincial distribution anomalies.
The data showed that during rabi season the urea offtake in Punjab was 817,817 tonnes that was 4 per cent less than over rabi 2020 whereas the sales in Sindh had surged 52pc to 360,520 tonnes over the last season.
The meeting was informed that over 100pc increase in urea offtake was witnessed in 10 districts of Sindh including Badin, Hyderabad, Jacob­abad, Khairpur, Larkana, Matiari, Naushahro Feroze, Sukkur and Thatta while Tando Muhammad Khan witnessed 300pc increase in urea sales.
On the other hand surplus urea was supplied to only six districts of Punjab with the highest offtake of 71.45pc over the rabi season 2020.
Appreciating the efforts of the Punjab government to stop urea hoarding, Mr Bak­htyar said that the Sindh government should also take measures to provide the fertiliser at affordable prices for boosting wheat production.
The minister said owing to negligence of the Sindh government to control prices of commodities in the province, especially in Karachi and Hyderabad, the country had witnessed a higher rate of inflation over the past years.

Major price decrease was recorded for onions 37.91pc, pulse moong 28.20pc, potatoes 25.82pc, tomatoes 11.72pc and sugar 0.57pc. 
Fahad Rauf of Ismail Iqbal Research said CPI is expected to clock in double digit from November i.e. 10.1pc versus 4MFY22 average of 8.7pc and October reading of 9.2pc. He said food, electricity and petroleum prices would be major contributor on MoM basis. 
He said the State Bank of Pakistan SBP had predicted 7pc to 9pc in CPI in FY22 but “in my opinion, CPI would range between 10.5pc to 11pc. However, in the first half of January-June 2022, the CPI is feared to range between 11.50-12pc due to rising energy prices and rupee devaluation against the dollar, which would increase the landing cost of imported finished and raw material items’ prices. 
Head of Research Pak Kuwait Investment Company, Samiullah Tariq said, “I see 10pc CPI in November.” 
He said in case Covid-19 makes a comeback, then the possible decline in oil prices would drive the food inflation down from 10pc. He added that crude oil price WTI on Friday had plunged by 10pc to $69.50 per barrel. Mr Tariq projected CPI for the calendar year 2022 at 10pc.
