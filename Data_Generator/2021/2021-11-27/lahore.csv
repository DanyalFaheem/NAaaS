0,Aleem announces quitting Punjab cabinet,Convinces PM that as a news channel owner he should be impartial,"LAHORE: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) stalwart and Punjab senior minister Abdul Aleem Khan has announced resigning from his office as he lost interest in the government primarily after not being considered for the province’s chief executive slot or any other active role. He had also stopped turning up in most of the provincial cabinet meetings.
Aleem met Prime Minister Imran Khan early on Friday and convinced the latter to allow him to tender his resignation on the pretext that he owned a news channel and wanted to maintain impartiality by stepping down.
“I met PM Imran Khan and convinced him that I should not hold any government office to maintain impartiality as being owner of News Channel Samaa. I requested [the PM] that the Punjab government may accept my resignation as senior minister/food minister,” Aleem tweeted.
In another tweet, Aleem stated that he was obliged to the prime minister for accepting his request. “I am sending my resignation to the Punjab chief minister,” he tweeted.

Convinces PM that as a news channel owner he should be impartial  

When contacted, Aleem Khan said he would meet Chief Minister Usman Buzdar on Saturday (today) and submit his resignation. He said he had reached Lahore after meeting the prime minister.
Considered to be a close aide of Prime Minister Imran Khan, Aleem hoped to become Punjab chief minister and had made several attempts to win the slot. In his first tenure, Aleem had occupied the 90 Shahrah-e-Quaid-e-Azam, a part of the Chief Minister’s Secretariat, and wanted to at least act like deputy chief minister. However, he could not succeed as Mr Buzdar secured unwavering support of the premier.  
Opposition PML-N had alleged that Buzdar suited the prime minister most as the latter wanted to run Punjab remotely from Islamabad.
As soon as Aleem started lobbying for the chief minister’s slot and giving a tough time to Buzdar, he was called by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in a case of assets beyond means. He was subsequently arrested in Feb, 2019. Aleem then resigned as senior minister/ local government minister.
He was granted bail by the Lahore High Court after more than three months, but he was not immediately inducted in the Punjab cabinet. It took him 14 months to return to the cabinet as a senior minister and later he was offered food department and denied the local government portfolio.
Despite having invested heavily [in the party] and becoming instrumental, among others, in the party’s rise, in the emerging scenario had dashed all his ambitions, reducing him to almost a non-entity.
Aleem had also attempted to resign some four months ago as he had sought permission from the prime minister, but the latter did not agree. After the premier’s refusal, Aleem was on record saying his businesses needed him more and the politics did. He had been vocal enough to say there was no role for him to play in the politics right now as things were going smooth for the party.
At personal level, he said, he had reset his priorities as he had been preoccupied with politics before and even after the 2018 elections and his businesses suffered badly because of this. “Aleem Khan had started drifting away from politics as well as the party and wanted to keep a safe distance with the party, while staying within its ranks,” a source said.
Aleem was now mainly stationed at Islamabad or in Karachi and making investments in the electronic media, banking and real estate sectors,” a source in the cabinet told Dawn.
“Ever since Aleem Khan was denied chief minister’s slot, or any other active role in the government, which was his priority, he gradually lost interest in the toothless slots,” the source added.

1,Loan default by sugar mills: Arguments sought on BoP plea maintainability,LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Friday sought arguments on the maintainability of a petition of the Bank of Punjab...,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Friday sought arguments on the maintainability of a petition of the Bank of Punjab (BoP) seeking recovery of a financial loan allegedly defaulted by Al-Arabia Sugar Mills owned by the family of Leader of the Opposition in National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif.  
At the outset of the preliminary hearing, a counsel for the bank stated before the court that the sugar mills had obtained a loan of Rs740 million. He said the mills failed to pay back the loan within the stipulated time despite the bank issuing repeated notices for the payment.
The counsel asked the court to allow the petition of the bank to be filed under the Financial Recovery Ordinance 2001 and order the sugar mills to clear its liability.  
Justice Jawad Hassan adjourned the hearing till next week and directed the bank’s counsel to come up with arguments on the maintainability of the petition.
SUMMONED: Lahore High Court Chief Justice  Muhammad Ameer Bhatti has sought personal appearance of the provincial  secretary for specialised healthcare to explain his position in a case  regarding non-issuance of appointment letter to an associate professor  despite recommendation of the Punjab Public Service Commission (PPSC).
Petitioner  Dr Faryad Hussain through his counsel Hafiz Tariq Nasim submitted that  he was fully eligible for his appointment having been recommended by  the PPSC and the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC).
The  counsel said the secretary for specialised healthcare had not issued the  appointment letter on the plea that the petitioner lacked five years  post experience.
He argued that in terms of the Pakistan Medical  Commission Act 2020 the recommendations of the defunct PMDC were  protected and could not be undone by the PPSC.
He further argued  that once the petitioner had been recommended by the PPSC, there was no  justification for withholding the issuance of his appointment letter as  associate professor.
He said the inaction of the respondents  appeared in violation of Article 4 of the Constitution whereby legal  rights of the citizens had been guaranteed.
Opposing the petition,  a law officer said the competent authority had not issued the  petitioner NOC and so far as the recommendations of the PPSC were  concerned one of the legal members of the PMC had written a letter to  undo the PPSC recommendations.
The chief justice issued a notice for personal appearance of the specialised healthcare secretary on Dec 7.
reference adjourned: An accountability court on Friday adjourned hearing of a money laundering reference against Leader of Opposition in National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif and his son Hamza due to unavailability of their counsel.
The court was told that defence counsel Amjad Pervaiz was out of the country and would return on Dec 9.
An associate of the counsel requested the court to adjourn the hearing.  
Shehbaz and Hamza were also present in the court.
Presiding Judge Naseem Ahmad Virk deferred the hearing till Dec 13 and directed the NAB to present its witnesses for cross-examination.
The NAB alleged that the family members and benamidars of Shehbaz received fake foreign remittances of billions in their personal bank accounts. In addition to these remittances, the bureau said, billions of rupees were laundered by way of foreign pay orders, which were deposited in personal bank accounts of his sons, Hamza and Suleman.
Shahbaz, his wife Nusrat and son Hamza had been indicted in the case.  
Being out of the country, Nusrat joined the trial proceedings through a pleader with the permission of the court.
Another accountability court also adjourned hearing of Ramzan Sugar Mills and Ashiana-i-Iqbal Housing Scheme references against Shehbaz, Hamza and others till Dec 13.

3,SHOs to foot-patrol city streets,CCPO hints at introducing standard design for police stations,"LAHORE: Lahore Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Fayyaz Ahmad Dev says station house officers (SHOs) in Lahore will visit door-to-door, streets, markets, and bazaars on foot to know about public problems to improve “a soft image of the police”. 
The foot patrol is an important part of modern policing, he told Dawn after inaugurating the new building of the Factory Area police station on Friday.
Mr Dev said the Lahore police had been directed to take back the police personnel from senior officers provided to them against the laid down policy. The retrieved personnel would be posted in police stations, he said, adding the department has also been directed to enhance patrolling. 

CCPO hints at introducing standard design for police stations 

He said maximum resources would be allocated to 85 police stations of the city, adding that in modern policing the police station was a basic unit that must be strengthened to achieve desired targets.
He said in the future, raids would be carried out jointly by operations and investigation wings to reduce the risk of injuries or any physical loss to the police, adding that standard guidelines have been issued to all the police officers to follow the same while carrying out raids for the arrest of the hardened and other criminals.
“We have also decided to introduce a standard design and infrastructure of the police station buildings of Lahore,” Dev said.
The prime theme of the initiative is to give an identity to police station buildings in the provincial capital.
Six more such multi-storey buildings are also under construction, which are Qila Gujar Singh, Gawalmandi, Faisal Town, Ravi and Chuhng police stations. He said he had directed the officers to complete the police station buildings by the end of December.
The Factory Area police station has four storeys and 42 rooms, which house front desk, community guide room, three lockups for males and females, six residential barracks for the police station staff, kitchen, Mess and a Gymnasium. The building cost Rs100.3m. He said the new building was a beautiful addition to the existing modern infrastructure of the provincial capital police. 
The CCPO said the staff of the police station would have to change their behaviour while discharging functions in the conducive environment provided in the new building.
He said the priorities have been changed with the passage of time with a focus on strengthening police stations for being basic unit of the police and this would help change the ‘thana culture’.
Dev highlighted the important role of citizens centric policing in crime control and maintenance of law and order in the city. “Anywhere in the world, police cannot get any success in crime control without cooperation and support of public,” he said.

Abdul Rauf, the petitioner, had assailed the order of the tribunal passed in 2017 and also a decision of the labour court issued in 2016. Both legal forums had dismissed the pleas of the petitioner against his termination by the Packages Limited. 
The petitioner was working as an assistant operation with the industry and was put on notice over consistent late arrival in 2014. An inquiry was conducted and he was dismissed on March 25, 2014. 
The petitioner claimed he was victimised for raising voice for the rights of minority workers in the industry. 
His counsel, Khalil Ismail, argued his client was not afforded proper and reasonable opportunity to contest the charge. He said a labour court had restrained the respondent industry from passing a final order against him but the order was not obeyed by the respondent and subsequent appeals were also dismissed by the appellant forums. 
Dismissing the petition, Justice Asim Hafeez observed that the charge was established against the petitioner both through verbal and documentary evidence during the inquiry. 
He noted that the petitioner’s counsel failed to place any document on record to show that the stay order of the labour court was communicated to the respondent.

The government could have earned a handsome revenue by auctioning these rusting and damaging vehicles.
Around 400 vehicles -- cars, motorcycles and rickshaws -- have been rusting for a decade in the police lines.  
Chiniot was upgraded to the district in 2009 and police line was established temporarily in a sports complex on Chiniot-Pindi Bhattian highway.
Like other districts, the unclaimed vehicles from various police stations were shifted here in the corner of the ground. The unclaimed vehicles are those abandoned by their at various places and later shifted here by the police. 
The vehicles also included those recovered from thieves, but their owners could not be traced. For the last 12 years, such vehicles have been accumulated. 
These vehicles are damaged totally or partially due to weather conditions. Almost all the vehicle tyres have been damaged. 
Despite security at the police lines, vehicles’ parts have been stolen or removed from these vehicles. 
An official said if these unclaimed vehicles had been auctioned, the government would have earned millions from them. 
A couple of years back, then district police officer Syed Hasnain Haider initiated a committee for the auction of these vehicles which consisted of representatives from the judiciary, deputy commissioner office, district accounts office and the DPO office. When the matter was taken up in the meeting of the committee, the representative from the judiciary, a senior civil judge, said that the vehicles should undergo a forensic check up to ascertain whether their chassis and engine numbers were tampered with or used in any criminal activity. The police took responsibility for forensic work, but could not complete it despite the passage of two years.
District bar secretary Chaudhry Badar Munir said the government should not only auction these vehicles on time to generate handsome revenue but also remove this junkyard which may spread dengue as their broken trees were breeding grounds of mosquitoes.
A spokesperson for the district police said a committee had been constituted a couple of years ago that decided to get vehicles’ checkups from the Punjab Forensic Science Laboratory of Lahore.  
“We are dispatching the vehicles to the lab in a batch of 30 vehicles. Once this activity is completed, the auction process will begin,” he added.

10,Four of 40 Punjab sugar mills not functional despite deadline lapse,"LAHORE: Out of total 40 sugar mills in Punjab, four are not crushing sugarcane though the provincial government had...","LAHORE: Out of total 40 sugar mills in Punjab, four are not crushing sugarcane though the provincial government had set Nov 20 as the last date for making all these units functional.
The four mills not operational are Pasrur Sugar Mills in Sialkot district, Shakar Gunj in Jhang, Chenab and Tandlianwala-I mills in Faisalabad district.
Punjab Cane Commissioner Muhammad Zaman Wattoo says a couple of the mills stopped crushing cane soon after start of the season on the excuse of non-availability of the crop, adding the officials were conducting field visits to ascertain the reasons for their closure.
The government had notified that sugar mills in south Punjab would begin crushing from Nov 15 and in other regions from Nov 20.
The province is likely to produce 63 million tonnes of cane, over 12 percent more than the 50 million tonnes of target set for the 2021-22 season. The crop has been sown on 1.88m acres against the target of 1.86m acres. The average yield is likely to remain around 744 maunds per acre, as per estimates of the Punjab Crop Reporting Service.
The minimum support price for sugarcane in Punjab has been fixed at Rs225 per maund, while in Sindh it is Rs250 per maund. This is creating problems for the Punjab mills as growers in the districts bordering Sindh are transporting their produce to the neighbouring province, taking advantage of the constitutional clause that puts no bar at inter-province trade.
The start of the crushing season has, however, begun bringing down prices of the locally- manufactured sweetener, which is selling at Rs87 per kg in the wholesale market. The rate of the local crystallised sugar had shot up to Rs140 per kg a couple of weeks ago, prompting the government to launch a crackdown on the hoarders.
To control the prices in the pre-crushing season, the government had imported sugar and supplied it in the open market. But, the powdered imported sugar failed to attract the consumers for its low sweetness.
Prime Minister Imran Khan alleged on Nov 5 that the sugar price hike was caused by closure of sugar mills in Sindh, where cane crushing season preceded Punjab by at least a fortnight. 
Subsequent to the reduced supplies from Sindh, he said, the millers in Punjab also began hoarding the commodity, pushing the price up to Rs140 per kg.

12,"Students rally for restoration of unions, fee cuts in Lahore",Also demand recovery of those picked from various universities including the University of Balochistan.,"LAHORE: Hundreds of students from various educational institutes of the city on Friday marched from Nasser Bagh to Charing Cross to demand restoration of student unions.  
The students solidarity march was organised by the Progressive Students Collective (PSC) while other organisations including the Peoples Students Federation (PSF), the Baloch Council, the Pukhtun Council, the Seriaki Council and the Punjabi Council participated. Students from Gilgit and Hazara also participated.  
Labourers, doctors, teachers, lawyers, civil society activists and political party’s representatives joined the students to express solidarity with them.  
The Students Solidarity March 2021 kicked off from Istanbul Chowk (Nasser Bagh) and concluded at Charing Cross on The Mall. The students holding red flags, placards and banners inscribed with slogans in favour of restoration of student unions, reduction in fees and provision of missing facilities chanted slogans in unison with drumbeats and music to highlight their demands.  
The students also demanded recovery of those picked from various universities including the University of Balochistan.  
They recited revolutionary poems to highlight the injustices done to them and the girls spoke about the problems they face on campuses.  
The students also condemned the eviction of their fellows from the hostels of the Punjab University and reiterated their resolve to continue their struggle for the restoration of student unions, representation of girl students on anti-harassment committees, reduction in fees, and provision of missing facilities in the educational institutions.  
Punjab Haqooq-i-Khalq Movement general secretary Muzzamil Kakar said the students were not given any representation in decision-making on the campuses about their future. The situation, they said, was increasing their problems. He said the students from remote areas in Balochistan and Fata were facing problems and it was bringing bad name for the state.  
“Most remote areas lack access to education and the students have to travel to big cities for education,’ he said.  
PSC’s Muqadas Jarral said the students were facing problems such as hefty increase in fees and harassment. “Free education is the basic right of every citizen under the constitution but they are being deprived of it,” she said. She further said the students were protesting on the roads of the country to demand their rights but the state was not ready to implement its constitution/ agreement with citizens.  
Senior journalist Munizae Jahangir lauded students for coming out on the streets to demand their rights despite pressure and oppression and said the ban on student unions was in contradiction with a call for ending the culture of dynastic politics in the country. “Those who talk against dynastic politics are the ones who ban student unions,” she pointed out.  
HKM member Farooq Tariq said all the provincial governments despite making promises were not restoring student unions in institutions and were involved in enforced disappearance of young students on university campuses in Balochistan.  
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) also issued a statement in support of the march.
