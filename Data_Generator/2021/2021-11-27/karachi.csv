Area SHO Asad-un-Nabi said that Zulfiqar was arrested for killing his wife, Laraib, 26.
He said she got divorce from her first husband from whom she had a son who lived with his father. She had ‘love marriage’ with Zulfiqar and less than a month ago gave birth to a baby boy. The couple often quarrelled with each other and on the night between Thursday and Friday, she called police helpline Madadgar-15 as she feared that her husband might kill her, but she did not divulge her address. 
The SHO said the police made efforts to trace the call but in vain. Later, the woman again made a phone call to Madadgar-15 and told the police that her life was in danger and this time she revealed her home address. The police rushed to the spot but when they reached she was already dead, he added.
The police arrested her husband and informed the victim’s sisters about the incident. They reached the police station and lodged a murder case against Zulfiqar. 
The officer revealed that the victim’s sisters refused to take custody of the infant child so the police handed him to the couple’s neighbours in Surjani Town.
He said that the man told the police that he had suspicion that his wife was in still in a relationship with her former husband.
BESK official shot dead
An official of the Board of Secondary Education Kara­chi was shot dead in Korangi on Friday, police said.
Area SHO Shahzada Saleem said Masood Ahmed, 55, was killed by armed pillion riders at Labour Square, Korangi-3. The body was shifted to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre to fulfil medico-legal formalities. 
The officer suspected some personal enmity behind the murder as the suspects did not take away anything from him.
He said that the victim was an employee at the BSEK. He was allegedly involved in apparently some illegal activities involving his place of work. People frequently visited his residence in Korangi, he said, adding that the murder might be linked with his activities.

1,Sindh Assembly passes new LG bill as opposition boycotts proceedings,"Functions of education, health taken away; mayor to be elected through secret ballot.","• Functions of education, health taken away
• Mayor to be elected through secret ballot
• Towns to replace DMCs
KARACHI: Amid opposition’s absence and based on its numeric majority in the Sindh Assembly, the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party on Friday get passed an amended local government bill that takes away functions of education and health care from municipal bodies and replaces open ballot for the election of mayors, deputy mayors, etc.
The Sindh Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2021 also abolishes District Municipal Corporations (DMCs) in urban parts of the province, replacing them with Town Municipal Corporations.
The opposition parties — Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, Grand Democratic Alliance, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan and Muttahida Majlis Amal — rejected the new law and boycotted the proceedings after lodging strong protest by chanting anti-government slogans and carrying placards.
Secret ballot introduced
According to the amended bill, any person could be elected by the council as mayor, deputy mayor, chairman or vice chairman but according to the Sindh Local Government Act, 2013, only elected members had been eligible to be crowned as mayor, deputy mayor, chairman or vice chairman. 
However, the indirect election would be held through secret ballot instead of open voting in the house to elect mayor, etc.
As per the amended bill, a metropolitan corporation would consist of over 5million people; municipal corporation between 300,000 to 5m; town in metropolitan corporation 500,000 to 750,000, town in municipal corporation 125,000 to 350,000; municipal committee 50,000 to 300,000; union committee in municipal corporation 45,000 to 75,000; union council 10,000 to 25,000 people.
The new bill has deprived the local government institutions of functions like education and health as they would deal only with municipal functions such as water, sanitation and garbage disposal.
‘Govt empowering LGs as per Bilawal’s vision’
Speaking on the bill, Local Government Minister Syed Nasir Hussain Shah said that the government was empowering the LG institutions through this bill as per the vision of Pakistan Peoples Party’s chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.
Justifying the urgency of tabling the amendment bill, he said that the Election Commission of Pakistan had given the provincial government a time frame for holding the LG election in Sindh.
Mr Shah said that the government consulted all major parties including PTI, MQM-P and Jamaat-i-Islami before tabling the amended bill and their proposals were also available on record. “We have incorporated their (opposition parties) recommendations in the bill,” he added.
As for the opposition protest over the bill, the LG Minister said: “It is not a final verdict and can be amended anytime.”
He also criticised the opposition members for boycotting the bill’s passage and said that they were assured of discussion on the bill. “They just want to oppose the bill without going through it,” he said.
The house passed the bill with a majority vote, without having a proper debate, in the presence of a lawmaker of the Tehreek Labbaik Pakistan.
Chaos in PA
Earlier, the house witnessed ruckus when Deputy Speaker Rehana Leghari allowed the LG minister to present the bill with opposition members protesting. 
They gathered in front of the speaker’s rostrum, chanting Kala Qanoon Na Manzoor (Black Law is unacceptable) slogans.
The chair tried to calm them down assuring them that they would be allowed to speak on the bill. “Let the bill be introduced, I will give you the floor,” she told the opposition members who opted to boycott the proceedings later.
Meanwhile, the house also passed the Sindh Telemedicine and Telehealth Bill, 2021.

A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Gulzar Ahmed said that the land would remain in the possession of the commissioner.
Main Raza Rabbani, lawyer for the builders, informed the bench that all constructions had been demolished by the builders themselves, adding that they were in the process of compensating some 99 allotttees.
However, he said that the debris was lying for which he requested for more time. The bench allowed 20 days, but pointed out after examining the pictures attached with a report that the foundation/basement of the building had not been demolished as yet. 
The counsel assured the bench that the same would also be completely removed.
The bench also directed the commissioner to ensure that all the structure of the building as well as debris must be cleared within the stipulated period.
The demolished building was located near the abandoned Gilani railway station of the Karachi Circular Railway in Block 13-D, Gulshan-i-Iqbal. The Pakistan Railways had claimed that the subject land was allotted for the KCR but it was encroached upon by the builders.
Last month, the Supreme Court had ordered the demolition of the under-construction multi-storey building after the builders failed to establish the ownership of the land.

4,14 infants diagnosed with congenital rubella syndrome in three years,‘Make sure that women are protected from rubella before they get pregnant’...,"KARACHI: Fourteen infants have been diagnosed with congenital rubella syndrome in a study being conducted at the National Institute of Child Health (NICH) in collaboration with the National Institute of Health, Islamabad and WHO, it emerged on Friday.
Experts associated with the project told Dawn that it’s the first-ever study, initiated in 2019, on this subject in Pakistan.
Rubella, or German measles, is a mild contagious viral infection that occurs most often in children and young adults. In pregnant women, the infection may cause congenital defects known as congenital rubella syndrome.
“Rubella is the leading vaccine-preventable cause of birth defects. It also results in high rate of prematurity, stillbirths, miscarriage and foetal death. This explains why it’s so important to include it in the ongoing country-wide vaccination drive along with measles,” explained Dr Jamal Raza, principal researcher of the study.

‘Make sure that women are protected from rubella before they get pregnant’

Dr Raza, who is also the executive director of government-run Sindh Institute of Child Health, said under the study blood samples from more than 500 infants (aged less than one year) suspected of having the illness had been sent to NIH from NICH — the largest public sector health facility for children in Sindh — for analysis in more than two years.
Six cases this year
“There were five positive cases of congenital rubella syndrome in 2019, three in 2020 and six this year so far. It’s still a very high number given the fact that it represents children at only one public sector healthcare facility,” he said.
About the birth defects in affected children, Dr Raza said the team was focusing only on congenital glaucoma/cataract, heart disease and deafness, though rubella congenital syndrome could cause one or multiple birth defects including small head size or microcephaly, intellectual disabilities, mental retardation, learning and development delays. According to Dr Raza, there is no cure for congenital rubella syndrome. The long-term outlook for a child born with the illness depends on the severity of birth defects and specific symptoms of the disease can be treated accordingly.
The NICH would have complete data on the illness once the study is completed in the next two years.
It is important to mention here that congenital rubella syndrome has been reported to affect an estimated 100,000 infants each year in the world, mainly in developing countries. No consolidated data exist on the prevalence of rubella infection in Pakistan.
Some local studies, however, indicate that rubella infection in females of child bearing age in Pakistan is a serious concern. For instance, a 2018 study conducted in Rawalpindi showed a high prevalence of rubella in females aged between 18 and 45.
“This is alarming as it can result in high risk of congenital rubella syndrome in newborns and foetal death. Therefore, women planning to become pregnant, who do not have natural immunity to rubella should be vaccinated at least 4 weeks prior to conception,” the study said.
In a 2019 study conducted in Lakki Marwat in Kyber Pakhtunkhwa a lot of women, particularly in the rural area, were found to have recent rubella infection, suggestive of placing many unborn babies to a high risk for acquiring congenital rubella syndrome.
These studies were published in the Journal of Islamabad Medical and Dental College and the Journal of the Pakistan Medical Association.
Life with disability
When asked how big the problem of rubella infection is among pregnant women in Pakistan, senior gynaecologist Dr Shershah Syed said: “It’s a major issue because rubella is very dangerous for a pregnant woman and her developing baby. Also, it’s important to understand that disability will have serious and long-term consequences not just on the individual himself but also on his family and society. Hence, it’s a vital family responsibility to make sure that women are protected from rubella before they get pregnant.”
Sharing observations of her clinical practice in Karachi, Dr Nusrat Shah, senior gynaecologist and Pro Vice Chancellor of Dow University of Health Sciences, said rubella infection among pregnant women was rare.
“This is because women have had it in childhood and develop natural immunity which is life-long. We routinely carry out the rubella IgG test for every pregnant woman to see her immune status and the test is positive, most of the time. This means the woman is immune either because she had childhood rubella or she has been vaccinated,” she added.
According to the experts, the initial finding of the NICH study suggests that a significant number of girls fail to get immunised against rubella that later affects them during pregnancy and the foetus.
“The government has now included vaccination against rubella in the Expanded Programme for Immunisation, raising hopes that the illness will be eliminated in the next few years in the country,” said Dr Raza.

5,"Protesting builders, residents baton-charged outside Nasla Tower",SC gives one week to demolish high-rise; builders want to know who has final authority in approval matters.,"KARACHI: While police and Rangers on Friday evening resorted to tear gas shelling and baton charge to disperse protesting residents and builders trying to stop the razing of Nasla Tower, the Supreme Court directed the Karachi commissioner to expedite the demolition process of the building and complete it within a week. 
Officials and witnesses said that the protesters belonging to the Association of Builders and Developers (Abad) arrived at the place and tried to block Sharea Faisal near Nursery roundabout, when law enforcers took action against them. 
East SSP Qamar Raza Jiskani told Dawn that the protesters allegedly tried to take law into their own hands. 
“The police and Rangers took action and dispersed the crowd,” added the senior officer. He said that no one was arrested. However, the officer hinted that there was a possibility of lodging an FIR against the protesters. 

 

 

SC gives one week to demolish high-rise; builders want to know who has final authority in approval matters

Traffic was suspended on the main artery that links the city to the airport and the National Highway. 
Construction work stopped in city
Earlier, the builders association had announced that they would hold a protest on service road in front of Nasla Tower. 
In a statement, Abad chairman Mohsin Sheikhani had said that they would be halting work on all approved projects in Karachi. 
He claimed that “despite the approvals of the buildings and projects from all the government agencies they stand null and void”. He said they request the government to inform them “who is the final authority for seeking approvals”. 
He said: “Abad is against the illegal encroachments and illegal construction. If illegal projects are constructed, it is the duty of government agencies to check them and give a no-objection certificate and Abad is following approvals strictly.” 
But despite approvals and getting permissions, there were the moves to shatter the confidence of the people, he said, adding: “We are backstabbing the overseas Pakistani and local investors who have invested millions of rupees.”
Announcing halting of work at projects in Karachi, Hyderabad and other cities, the Abad chairman vowed that “slowly the work in other parts of the country will also be stopped”. 
SC gives one week for demolition
A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Gulzar Ahmed and comprising Justice Ijaz Ul Ahsan and Justice Qazi Mohammad Amin Ahmed directed the commissioner to expedite the demolition process of the 15-storey Nasla Tower and complete it in a week and to ensure safety of public and its property. 
Commissioner Iqbal Memon filed a fresh report on Friday along with some photographs showing that some walls of the ground floor of the building to upper floors had been removed. 
When the CJP asked him why the demolition process was started from the ground floor, the commissioner replied that he had engaged the services of some experts/engineers who were present on the spot and supervising the process. 
Replying to another query of the bench, he said that there were 200 workers taking part in the demolition drive. The CJP directed him to enhance the strength of workers from 200 to 400 workers and expedite the process. 
During the hearing, the CJP expressed serious resentment on Jamaat-i-Islami’s Karachi chief Hafiz Naeem ur Rehman for ‘disturbing’ the hearing as he repeatedly attempted to address the court about compensation for allotttees of Nasla Tower. 
The CJP told him that the court had already passed an order directing the builders to refund the amount to all allotttees. 
The chief justice also questioned his locus standi in the matter and asked him to maintain silence, but the JI city chief insisted on arguing. 
The CJP remarked that this was not the forum to deliver a political speech and warned to charge him with contempt proceedings.

6,"Opposition rejects LG bill, says it opens door to ‘horse-trading’",Vows to challenge ‘black law’ in court...,"KARACHI: Calling the Sindh Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2021 against the spirit of devolution of power to grassroots level, the opposition parties in Sindh Assembly on Friday unanimously rejected the provincial government’s bill and vowed to challenge the move of the Pakistan Peoples Party-led government in the apex court.  
The opposition leaders said the legislation, which they termed a black law, would “deprive local governments of their core functions and authorities” and warned that it could also take to the streets against the proposed law.  
The announcement from the opposition parties came at their joint press conference led by Opposition Leader in Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh, which was held minutes after the bill had been tabled in the Sindh Assembly.  
The opposition leaders gathered at the media corner of the Sindh Assembly building and shared sketchy details about their future protest plan.  

Vows to challenge ‘black law’ in court

“This bill negates the Article 140-A of the Constitution,” said Mr Sheikh flanked by leaders of other opposition parties including of Kanwar Naveed Jameel of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan, Hasnain Mirza of Grand Democratic Alliance, Abdul Rasheed and dozens of opposition members of the assembly.  
“Now everyone has come to know that why the PPP wanted to keep its draft secret. They were guilty conscious because they knew that they had violated the Constitution, defied the democratic norms and crushed the every tradition of values. Till the last moment and even secretary of the assembly was not provided with copies of the bill. From assembly to court, we would raise this issue everywhere.” 
He referred to the rules of the house according to which, the draft of the bill was supposed to be presented to legislators two days before tabling it in the house so that they could provide their inputs.  
He accused the PPP government of using the ‘backdoor’ to present the bill in the house while bulldozing rules and regulations.  
“There’s a dictatorship in the Sindh Assembly. The opposition has been silenced forcibly and after removing the opposition from the crucial Public Accounts Committee and the standing committees, the members of the opposition have practically been deprived of the status of legislators,” he added.  
‘Robbery to snatch local bodies’ powers’ 
Kunwar Naveed Jamil of the MQM-P called the bill presented by the treasury benches a ‘robbery’ and an attempt to snatch powers from the local bodies’ representatives only to give monopoly to the PPP’s provincial government even in municipal affairs.  
He warned that his party would call meeting of its leaders and it could take to the street for protest if the PPP government insisted to stick with the same bill.  
“That’s tantamount to injustice to the people of Sindh,” he said. “The bill was laid in the house without taking opposition in confidence and not allowing open discussion on the bill. The amendment to LG Act will pave the way for secret balloting for election of Mayor or chairmen of LG bodies. This would lead to horse-trading and in fact this particular amendment was made to open new opportunity for the PPP members. We have kept our options open and if things are not changed, you may see us on roads in protest against this bill.” 
Parliamentary leader of GDA Hasnain Mirza blamed the PPP of imposing “civil dictatorship” in Sindh thwarting democratic process in the assembly.  
He said that the rules of the assembly required prior notice for moving a bill so that members of assembly could be given time to present their suggestions.  
“We are elected representatives of people of Sindh and it is our responsibility to protect rights and interests of masses,” he said appealing to the Supreme Court to take notice of the “PPP’s way of governance where all the rule and norms of democracy are being violated”. 
He said that the bill was aimed at promoting horse trading and corrupt practices in local government elections. 
The JI MPA Abdur Rasheed said the PPP had started rigging elections even before announcing the local bodies’ elections and called the fresh bill in the Sindh Assembly ‘beginning of horse trading.  
The process of devolution of power to grassroots level, he said, must culminate in the upcoming LG elections.  
“We have always demanded and again make it clear that Karachi Development Authority, Sindh Building Control Authority, Karachi Water and Sewerage Board, Solid Waste Management and other civic services should be transferred to local government institutions,” he said.  
The PPP government, he said, was in deep fear of losing the local bodies’ elections in all major urban centres of Sindh that it had started using its provincial assembly to legalise all “illegal moves” which included control of municipal agencies and institutions.

8,‘Disaster management course be included in syllabi’,DADU: Speakers at a seminar held here on Friday called for designing disaster management courses and inducting them...,"DADU: Speakers at a seminar held here on Friday called for designing disaster management courses and inducting them in the syllabi at college and university levels so that youths could learn how to deal with a situation caused by natural disasters timely and effectively.
The seminar titled “Earthquakes in Pakistan: causes, consequences and way forward” was organised by Sindh  University’s Pakistan Study Centre.
Professor Dr Shuja Ahmed Mahesar, director of the centre, pointed out that the country had a history of natural disasters and in many cases they caused heavy casualties and left a trail of destruction. He recalled that four earthquakes measured at 6 on Richter scale had struck the northern areas and Balochistan in the recent past.
“More  than 85,000 people had lost their lives in the October 2005 Azad Kashmir earthquake alone”, he said, and stressed the need for chalking out plans to cope with such situations in a better manner with a view to save as many lives as possible.
“We all should stand and work together as a team to deal with a situation arising out of disasters,” he said. 
SU’s Centre for Pure and Applied Geology director Dr Rafique Ahmed Lashari said  that Pakistan had successfully made arrangements in terms of  both institutional developments and  coordination among various stakeholders to cope with natural disasters, including floods. 
He lauded the performance of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and its provincial chapters, as well as the Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority (ERRA) for their quick response in the face of the Kashmir earthquake  in 2005.
He said there was an undocumented but well-drilled  preparedness plan for response, relief, and recovery involving dedicated  agencies and departments at the federal, provincial and local  government levels. “The same is, however, not true for the rest  of disasters arising out of natural hazards such as flash floods,  earthquakes, and landslides,” he observed. He argued that Pakistan’s entire focus on disaster preparedness and management relied on mobilisation  of the armed forces or provision of relief goods (food, water, tents, blankets, medicine, etc) through district relief offices. 
Dr Lashari said that Pakistan is located in the fault zone, hence the country should review its disaster management policy and develop a  contingency plan on avoiding heavy loss of life and infrastructure in the face of natural disasters.
Dr Abdul Razaq Channa said that natural  disasters cast a severe impact on human life. Institutions of higher education should induct disaster management course in their syllabi so that youths could learn  how to respond timely and in professional manner in the face of natural disasters, he said, and called for designing such courses at the earliest.
A large number of researchers, besides students and teachers, attended the seminar.
