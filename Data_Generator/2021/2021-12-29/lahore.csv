The minor canal irrigates various southern villages of Sadiqabad tehsil. The usual water flow in the canal is 70 to 75 cusecs but its actual discharge was more than that as a result of which a breach occurred and water flowed into wheat fields of the adjoining area.  
Locals said they plugged the breach by themselves as no official of the irrigation department reached there to help them out.  
Senior Engineer Chaudhry Abdul Wahid told this correspondent that the breach was plugged by the irrigation staff before noon. It occurred owing to closure of some water channels as a result of which water level rose in the canal. He said the supply of water was stopped at Sadiq Branch canal.  
Sadiqabad Assistant Commissioner Kaleem Yousuf told Dawn that he reached the spot and monitored the rescue activities undertaken with the the help of local residents. He said water wreaked havoc on wheat spread over 15 acre and partially damaged crop over 45 acre.  
The case of the affected farmers had been sent to the deputy commissioner for compensation, he said.

1,Shafqat Mehmood questions Zardari’s ‘eligibility’ for campaign,"Let former prime minister Nawaz Sharif return home and then the people would see whose legs would tremble, he says.","LAHORE: Federal Education Minister Shafqat Mahmood says how Asif Ali Zardari can launch a campaign against the government when he should be in jail.  
Speaking to the media at the Punjab Assembly on Tuesday, he said Mr Zardari could not launch any anti-government drive because the PPP leader was facing multiple corruption cases and should be in jail instead.  
Let former prime minister Nawaz Sharif return home and then the people would see whose legs would tremble, he remarked while answering a question. Referring to NAB (National Accountability Bureau) references against the PML-N leader, he wondered that Mr Sharif was unaware of deposits worth Rs16 billion in his bank account.  
Responding to a query, Mr Mahmood, who had been appointed central Punjab president after dissolution of party organisations of the ruling PTI, said there was no progress with regard to reorganisation of the party though intra-party consultations were going on the matter. He said a final decision on the issue would be taken by party chairman Imran Khan.  
He, however, said the party was making full preparations for the forthcoming local body polls.
Explaining the purpose behind his visit to the provincial assembly, the federal minister said he was here to discuss various political matters with the PML-Q, an ally of the ruling party. He sought to negate the impression that he was here to appease PML-Q leader Chaudhry Parvez Elahi and said he (Mr Elahi) was like his brother.  
He said his meeting with the speaker was very congenial and announced that both the allies would jointly pitch strong candidates in the local polls. He said Mr Elahi had vast political experience and the polls would be contested with his consultation.

2,Punjab Assembly passes six bills after suspending rules,Agenda of the day was not issued even after proceedings of the house had started after a delay of two and a half hours.,"LAHORE: The Punjab Assembly on Tuesday passed six bills on private members day after suspending rules to take up the legislative business before the Question Hour.  
Interestingly, agenda of the day was not issued even after proceedings of the house had started after a (usual) delay of two and a half hours.
Rule No 42 of the Rules of Procedure says that questions and their answers will be taken up in the first hour of a sitting and traditionally these are taken up immediately after recitation of the Quran and Na’at.
But, Speaker Chaudhry Parvez Elahi suspended the rule on Tuesday and took up legislative work first.  
Five bills, four of them related to private universities, were passed, while two fresh bills for grant of charter to new private universities were introduced without circulating the same among the MPAs as well as press gallery members.  
PML-N lawmaker Azma Bukhari regretted that members were neither provided agenda of the day nor were copies of the bills being introduced in the house.  
QUESTION HOUR: Law Minister Raja Basharat and the opposition joined hands in criticising Transport Minister Jehanzeb Khichhi for answering the queries of the lawmakers without preparation.  
Raja Basharat lamented that ministers would come to the house without proper briefings and would put up three-year old answers when the questions raised years ago would have lost their worth and purpose.  
Two questions about the likely start of the Orange Line Metro train were included in today’s Question Hour though the train had become operational over a year ago.  
Advising his cabinet colleagues to get briefings on the latest situation from their relevant departments before coming to answer the questions, Raja Basharat also demanded a ruling from the chair on the issue.  
His views were endorsed by Ms Bukhari who said that the house was being run in violation of the Rules of Procedure. She said answers to questions were kept pending for two years and if somehow these were taken up, the relevant minister would be missing from the house.
The chair held by Panel of Chairmen Waseem Badozai agreed to the opinion but did not immediately give the ruling.
The house unanimously adopted a resolution calling for officially observing the death anniversary of First Righteous Caliph Hazrat Abu Bakar Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him). The resolution was moved by MPA Moavia Azam Tariq.  
The session was later prorogued for an indefinite period.

4,"50,000 await new electricity connections in Fesco area",Meters shortage behind the delay in provision of utility,"CHINIOT: Over 50,000 new electricity consumers are awaiting new connections and power supply for the last five months as the Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (Fesco) failed to procure electricity meters for them on time. 
According to a notification, dated 28-01-2018, issued by the Pakistan Electric Power Company (Pepco), all the distribution companies (Discos) are bound to provide electricity connections to the category-I consumers seeking up to 15 kilowatt load within 30 days, to category-II consumers seeking 16-70 kilowatt within 44 days and category-III connections seeking load of 71-500 kilowatt within 73 days. However, the shortage of electricity meters has left thousands of new consumers without electricity in the areas of Fesco.  

Meters shortage behind the delay in provision of utility

Dawn has learnt that the undue delay in the procurement process of electricity meters has caused the delay. As a result, 50,000 new applicants of new connections who have paid the demand notice amount months back are waiting for provision of electricity since July 2021.  
Due to the delay, on the one hand, Fesco is deprived of not only millions of rupees it can earn from new connections while on the other hand, commercial and industrial units are being stopped from starting new businesses and expanding their work. 
Dildar Hussain, a local furniture trader, says that he has been waiting for a connection for his new furniture factory for months but in vain and he has been told that there are no electricity meters.  
Fateh Sher Khokhar, the president of the district bar association, has demanded the Ministry of Water and Power and National Electric Power Authority (Nepra) take notice of the situation and direct Fesco to expedite the new connections process or the people awaiting connections will exercise their legal rights through courts. 
Sheikh Tahir, public relations officer (PRO) at Fesco headquarters, says the company is procuring new electricity meters, wires and other accessories for new meters according to the rules and a transparent process. It had called for tenders some months ago but the local electricity meter manufacturers formed cartels in bidding process and provided exorbitant rates, which were not acceptable by Fesco, he adds.  
The tenders, he continues, were given again and after completion of procedural formalities, the tenders were awarded to a private firm, which provided Fesco with the first tranche of some 7,000 meters and the mid-January, it will be provide 70,000 meters, which will be sufficient to clear the backlog.  
Mr Tahir has confirmed that about 50,000 electricity connections are pending, saying that Fesco has awarded tenders for procurement of 700,000 meters, which will be sufficient for all new connections in the near future.

“Federal ministers Khusro Bakhtiar and Asad Umar are involved in sugar and flour scams, Pervaiz Khattak in Malam Jabba and BRT and Qasim Suri in the fake vote scandal,” Ms Bokhari told reporters outside the Punjab Assembly on Tuesday.  
Prime Minister Imran Khan had dissolved the PTI’s organisational structure after the party’s humiliating defeat in local polls in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and appointed Asad Umar as party’s central secretary general, education minister Shafqat Mahmood as Punjab president, Khusro Bakhtiar as south Punjab president, defence minister Pervaiz Khattak as KP president, maritime affairs minister Ali Zaidi as Sindh president and National Assembly Deputy Speaker Qasim Suri as Balochistan president.  
The PML-N lawmaker further said “the thieves” were making a new PTI. “There seems to be not a single clean person in the party who takes the PTI reins,” she lamented and added Imran Khan was solely responsible for the PTI’s humiliating defeat in KP.
Chiding Hasaan Khawar, special assistant to the chief minister on information, Ms Bokhari said: “Khawar should not try to portray CM Buzdar like Shehbaz Sharif. His stature is too small to make comments on Nawaz Sharif,” she said and added that Khawar was not a political person as he grabbed this position through a ‘parchi.’ 
Answering a question about the return of PML-N Quaid Nawaz Sharif, she said he would return to Pakistan soon as this was his own country. “When the date of Nawaz’s return would be announced some people would be in hospital after hearing this,” she said.  
Meanwhile, PML-N Punjab president Rana Sanaullah issued a show-cause notice to Sargodha division vice-president Malik Aslam Khachla for displaying banners against party’s MNA Hamid Hameed and directed him to submit a reply in 15 days.

The chief minister said work was in progress to speedily complete the schemes to develop the provincial metropolis. The government had set an example of saving millions in such projects, he said.  
Every promise, made with the people, had been fulfilled; he said and maintained that the political future of the critics was bleak. The propagandists should realise that the people could not be served with hollow slogans as the PTI-led government had initiated real changes at the grassroots, he concluded.

“The government wants to make parliament a rubber stamp to meet IMF requirements. The mini-budget and legislation in this regard is in fact an attack on the sovereignty of parliament, the State Bank of Pakistan, national interest and security,” he said in a statement on Tuesday.
The PML-N president said if the parliament failed to stand for the interests of the people, it would not be considered a representative body of the people.
“This mini-budget is a practical interpretation of taking the entire ship to the bottom of the sea just because one fears drowning himself,” he said. The government itself drowned in the flood of public hatred and was now imprisoning the country in the cage of the IMF, he added.
“This year, an increase in the prices of petroleum products by more than Rs39 is an injustice. The price of medicines has been steadily rising over the past three years of PTI rule.”
He said the PTI government’s acknowledgement of the reduction in sugar production in the National Assembly was a denial to its earlier claims. The government’s acknowledgement of the closure of two percent of textile mills due to the gas shutdown confirmed the concerns and warnings sounded by the opposition beforehand.
He said facts, information and documentary evidence acknowledged that the economy was in shambles.

20,LHC judge rules mere confession not enough for conviction,"Acquits murder convict, saying prosecution failed to prove case and remove doubts.","LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has observed that the mere admission of a suspect is not sufficient for conviction and the responsibility to prove a case beyond any shadow of reasonable doubt squarely lies with the prosecution.
“If it (prosecution) fails to successfully discharge it, the only result can be the extension of benefit of doubt to the accused person,” Justice Muhammad Tariq Nadeem rules in a verdict acquitting a murder convict.
The verdict further states that it is an established proposition that multiple doubts are not required in this regard; even a single circumstance creating doubt in a prudent mind is sufficient.
The judge observes that it is an obvious principle of law that in case of doubt, the benefit thereof must accrue in favour of a suspect as a matter of right and not of grace.

Acquits murder convict, saying prosecution failed to prove case and remove doubts

Appellant Ghulam Dastagir was convicted under Section 302(c) of the PPC and awarded 14 years of rigorous imprisonment.
The complainant’s counsel argued that the appellant himself admitted in his statement that he murdered the deceased in self-defence. He said after the confession of the accused the weakness of the prosecution’s case became irrelevant.
Justice Nadeem observes that it was the primary duty of the prosecution to establish its own case independently instead of depending upon the weaknesses of defence. In this case, he observes, the prosecution miserably failed to discharge its duty and did not produce sufficient incriminating evidence to connect the appellant with the commission of offence.
“I am quite confident to hold that the defence plea can be accepted or rejected intotoand the practice of picking and choosing some sentences favouring the prosecution in isolation of those favouring the accused/appellant is strictly prohibited by the law,” the judge adds.
The judge allowed the appeal observing that the prosecution failed to prove its case against the appellant beyond any shadow of doubt and set aside his conviction.
AIRHOSTESS’ SUIT: The Lahore High Court has dismissed a petition of a senior airhostess who was terminated from service on charges of submitting a fake graduation degree at the time of her appointment.
Samina Saleem was appointed as an airhostess in the Pakistan International Airlines in 1996. For verification of her BA degree that she submitted, the matter was referred to the university concerned, which reported the document was fake and bogus.
Consequently, a show-cause notice was issued to the petitioner by the authority and she was dismissed from service on Dec 27, 2018, as her reply was deemed unsatisfactory.
The petitioner instituted a suit to challenge the order of her dismissal from service wherein a civil court rejected the plaint on the grounds that the suit was barred by law. The court said the remedy available to the petitioner was a suit for damages and that the suit for declaration instituted by her was not maintainable. She approached the high court after her appeal was rejected by a sessions court also.
The petitioner pleaded that there was no need to submit a BA degree and that the qualification for the appointment of an airhostess was only intermediate. She had provided her intermediate certificate, which was not found to be fake and, therefore, she could not be dismissed on account of irrelevant documents that was not a condition for the job appointment.
Justice Rasaal Hassan Syed observes in his verdict that perusal of the reply to the show-cause notice and the contents of pleadings by the petitioner show that she did not claim that her degree was genuine, but only maintained that there was no need to file a BA degree as it was not the academic requirement for the appointment.
The judge notes that in the present instance the removal of the petitioner from service was on account of furnishing a fake document and the remedy did not lie in seeking a declaration rather the petitioner would be entitled to seek damages, which she could be granted if she proved that the termination was not genuine or amounted to unfair treatment.
The judge further observes that where a service grievance is agitated by an employee who is not governed by statutory rules of service, such a petition under Article 199 of the Constitution will not be maintainable.
The judge dismissed the petition of the airhostess being without substance.
