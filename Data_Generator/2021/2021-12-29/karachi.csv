0,"SC orders removal of ‘unauthorised’ mosques, cemetery from two parks",CJP rules KMC can’t allow construction of mosque in parks; warns cancellation of illegal allotments in PECHS,"KARACHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday came down hard on the city administration for allowing establishment of illegal cemetery, mosques and shrines on public spaces and ordered the authorities to remove all encroachments and retrieve the land meant for public parks.
A two-judge SC bench comprising Chief Justice of Pakistan Gulzar Ahmed and Justice Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed directed the Karachi commissioner and other officials to remove a graveyard, a mosque and a shrine on the Kidney Hill Park premises and a mosque constructed on another park near Tariq Road within a week and restore the land to its original purpose.
It also asked the commissioner to explore the possibility to shift the graves to a proper cemetery.

CJP rules KMC can’t allow construction of mosque in parks; warns cancellation of illegal allotments in PECHS

The CJP deplored that the city had been facing massive unauthorised and illegal constructions and encroachments on public spaces and there was no way to reverse or fix it.
He remarked that the officials concerned, who were bound to protect such places, did not bother to come out of their offices to address such issues and even not properly implementing directives as the court had already passed several orders about the Kidney Hill Park in the past.
“You are not there to sit for yourselves, but to serve the public,” the CJP further.
Justice Amin said that such misconduct on the part of the officials concerned would lead to their dismissal from service.
The CJP said that there was permission of ground plus one floor, but multi-storey buildings had been raised in Pakistan Employees Cooperative Housing Society (PECHS), North Nazimabad and other parts of the city and feared that there would be destruction in case of an earthquake.
The open spaces on the front and backsides of houses in PECHS are also encroached upon, the CJP said, adding that the land in the PECHS had been allotted in the ‘50s and ‘60s, but surprisingly the cases of recent allotments were still coming on record.
He warned to cancel all such allotments and order registration of FIRs against the officer-bearers of PECHS.
At the outset, the bench asked Commissioner Iqbal Memon about implementation of its earlier orders about the Kidney Hill Park. He replied that the then commissioner in his report submitted in June said all the encroachments had been removed.
However, the court was informed that there was still a graveyard while a new mosque in the place of a demolished mosque as well as a shrine had also been established on the park land.
The CJP expressed serious resentment over the Karachi commissioner, Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, administrator of the district municipal corporation-East and assistant commissioner-Ferozabad for not implementing the court orders.
When the bench confronted the officials, Assistant Commissioner Asma Batool submitted that Al-Fateh Mosque had been removed from the park. An application was filed against the removal of the mosque on the ground that the land was leased out in 1990. The bench dismissed the application and observed that the layout plan did not provide any space for mosque and KMC itself had no authority to allot or allow permission of construction of a mosque on the land of a park.
The KMC or any other licensing agency could only give possessory rights and such rights did not culminate into ownership or title of the land, the bench ruled.
When the court was informed that another mosque, Bismillah Masjid, had been raised on the premises of the park, it observed that the same was also illegal even if there was any allotment and directed the commissioner to remove it.
The bench was informed that the authorities concerned had no record of the graves. The court directed the commissioner to retrieve the whole land and if there was any genuine grave the same should be protected.
The bench ordered, “The commissioner Karachi shall also explore a possibility of shifting of the graves from Kidney Hill Park to the properly declared graveyard and take appropriate measures in this regard in accordance with law.”
During the proceedings, the court was informed that another mosque, Madina Masjid, had also been built on a land measuring around 1,100 square yard shown as a park in PECHS on main Tariq Road. 
The bench expressed resentment at DMC-East administrator when he requested it to pass an order about the removal of the mosque and said that it was his duty to restore public spaces. It directed the administrator to ensure the removal of the mosque and other encroachments in a week and restore the land as a park.
The CJP expressed anger at AC Batool when the bench was informed that she had tried to stop the demolition work of 15-storey Nasla Tower. The bench warned her that she could be sent to prison. She contended that the work was halted temporarily to take preventive and safely measures.
On a previous hearing, the commissioner had informed the bench that the 62-acre land of the Kidney Hill Park had been retrieved and a PC-I of Rs950m had been submitted to develop it as a model park.
Al-Bari Towers
The ministry of housing and works in its report informed the apex court that the land located in Bahadur Yar Jang Cooperative Housing Society and used to build Al-Bari Towers was not allotted as it was meant for amenity purposes.
However, appearing on behalf of the builder senior lawyer Rasheed A. Razvi sought adjournment on the ground that he had not received copies of the reports including the one filed by the ministry.
The bench adjourned the hearing till Jan 11 and directed him to obtain the copies from its office and come prepared on the next date.
On the last hearing, the bench was informed that a plot measuring 3,931 square yards and meant for a family park in Bahadur Yar Jang Cooperative Housing Society had been divided into three plots and only a small portion of the plot left for the park. The other two plots were allotted and a huge building, known as Al-Bari Towers, was built.
The court had ruled that none of the parties create any third party interest.

1,Case against plot owner of Nasla Tower registered,"Not a single official, builder named in FIR","kARACHI: Police on Tuesday finally registered a criminal case against the builder of Nasla Tower, officials of the Sindh Building Control Authority, Sindhi Muslim Cooperative Housing Society and the plot owner for helping, facilitating and ignoring the illegal construction of the multi-storey residential building on Sharea Faisal, which is being demolished on the orders of the apex court. 
The FIR was lodged on behalf of the state and it carried eight different sections of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) ranging from fraud and cheating to illegal actions of government officers and criminal breach of trust by public servants. 

Not a single official, builder named in FIR 

However, only one person — Abdul Qadir who owns the plot in question — was named in the FIR and remaining suspects were nominated with their designations as their names were not part of the document. 
It said Mr Qadir in connivance with the officials of the SBCA, Master Plan Department (MPD) and SMCHS had managed to encroach 341 yards of the service road and attach it with the original plot.
Only on Monday, the Supreme Court had ordered the authorities to lodge an FIR against SBCA officials, including its director general. 
The FIR says the plot of Nasla Tower is 780 square yards in the SMCHS and the society had allotted 780 square yards to the owner/builder, Abdul Qadir, who — in collusion with his construction partners and officials from SMCHS, SBCA, MPD and other departments — had erected Nasla Tower on 1,121 square yards — illegally building on 341 square yards of a service road — and sold flats and shops to people. 
Responding to a query, SSP-East Qamar Raza Jiskani told Dawn that the SP Investigation had been tasked with directly supervising the probe that had attracted a national interest after the Supreme Court’s order. Replying to another question about no names directly mentioned in the FIR except the owner of the plot, he said the matters was ‘too old’ and it would now take time to find out the people at different offices and positions who had actually granted the permission and helped construction of the illegal building on the plot. 
“So we have kept the scope of the probe and the FIR quite wide,” said SSP Jiskani. “The FIR has been drafted and lodged with all due care mentioning each and every single office and position which possibly had facilitated Nasla Tower one way or the other. Now during course of the probe, the names would start emerging which would be incorporated in the FIR. The SP investigation has been asked to directly supervise the case and its probe. It should not be handled like regular case.” 
An FIR at the Ferozabad police station has been lodged under Sections 161 (public servant taking gratification other than legal remuneration in respect to an official act), 167 (public servant framing an incorrect document with intent to cause injury), 218 (public servant framing incorrect record or writing with intent to save person from punishment or property from forfeiture), 408 (criminal breach of trust by clerk or servant), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) and 447 (criminal trespass) of the PPC.

An official said that an intelligence-driven raid was carried out in the SITE-Superhighway area, which led to the arrest of the suspects.
Two hand-grenades and a pistol were also seized from them.
“They have been identified as Anas Khan and Firdous. An FIR has been lodged against them with the SITE-Superhighway police station,” the official said. 
“Findings of initial investigation suggest that they got militant training in Afghanistan. Suspect Anas was previously arrested in Afghanistan and remained in Pul-i-Charkhi prison from 2007 to 2012. His father was also a member of TTP-Waziristan and killed last year,” the official added.
Guard dies after falling into lift shaft

The area police said the victim, identified as Tariq Jawed, went to the sixth floor of the building through stairs to perform his regular duty in Block-16.
“After finishing his duty, the victim moved to the lift and opened its door,” said a police official. “He opened the door of the lift and went inside, but the lift was not there and he fell down to the ground, dying on the spot.”
The official said that the police were gathering further details and facts. A case would be lodged in line with the desire of the victim’s family.

“I am also going to the areas where PPP does not have a vote bank. We do not have a single MPA in Korangi district but we are continuing development work according to the party’s vision,” he said.
He expressed these views while talking to media persons after inaugurating newly constructed Aqsa Park in a Model Colony union committee here.
“We will change Karachi. Development work will be done in every part of the city as Rs1.5 billion has been allocated for construction and repair of roads in the city and work has been started by dividing Karachi into three parts,” he said.
He said that tenders had been issued in this regard and procurement was in progress. 
The administrator, who is also the provincial government’s spokesman and chief minister’s law adviser, said that now the work of cleanliness in Korangi district would be carried out by the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board for which three-month time had been given. 
“The chief minister has approved a development plan under which the road from Sharea Faisal to Kala Board and goths will be constructed,” he added.
He said that Aqsa Park of Korangi district had been rebuilt with the resources of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation.
Barrister Wahab said that the park had been made very beautiful, adding that new plants, trees are planted and benches had been provided for the citizens.

“This celebratory firing results in grief for others, killing and injuring innocent people. The survivor of this firing mostly suffers from paralysis. This is all due to the negligence of our institutions, which are responsible for protecting people’s lives. How long will citizens suffer from this? It is time to get rid of this menace,” the statement said.

5,"Traders at MQM moot reject LG law, treatment meted out to Karachi","""We want the cities to receive funds from the province like the province receives from the federal government,"" says resolution.","KARACHI: Just two weeks after holding a multiparty conference that rejected amendments brought about by the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party to the local government bill, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan organised a Karachi traders’ conference at its temporary headquarters in Bahadurabad to go over the PPP’s new LG law here on Tuesday.
MQM deputy convener Kanwar Naveed Jameel read out a resolution that said that the PPP-led Sindh government was hurting business, education and had taken away basic facilities and rights of the people of Karachi.
“Therefore, the people here, specifically the business community of Karachi have come to this conclusion that they reject the new local government act. The system is stopping the city’s economic growth. And the amendment to the 2013 LG law is taking control of all local government powers. It is paralysing them. 

‘Our courts are more interested in demolishing towers but they don’t see the demolition of our Constitution’

“We want the local government to be self-sufficient. We want the cities to receive funds from the province like the province receives from the federal government. So stop going against this city. Give it its basic rights. Or we will keep fighting for our rights until we are given back our rights,” the resolution read.
Earlier, welcoming the guests, MQM-P leader Khawaja Izhar ul Hasan shed light on the issue. He said 70 per cent of Pakistan’s economy stood on Karachi’s contribution and 75pc of that contribution came from the trade and business community of the city. Therefore, they called them here. 
“The decisions we make today will therefore be noteworthy for the betterment of Karachi,” he said, adding that the MQM had always moved forward while taking the business community on board.
“Now we pay taxes for everything, save air. And despite so many taxes we don’t have transport, we don’t have garbage disposal system, we don’t have clean water. There is nothing happening for anyone’s good in union councils,” he fumed.
Chairman of Aram Bagh Alliance Asif Gulzar said that if the Sindh government was unable to take care of Karachi, then it should think about making it a separate province.
Chairman of All Karachi Sarafa Tajir Ittehad Shakir Fancy said that Karachi could only be saved through jihad. “Every resident of Karachi should think about Karachi and stand up against those using Karachi for their ulterior motives,” he said.
Abdullah Bantwa of West Orangi Town Traders said that he was aware of the ‘cat and mouse game’ being played here.
Ilyas Memon of Tariq Road Tajir Alliance said that Karachi looked abandoned and disowned.
Shah Zaman of All Karachi Shadi Hall Association said that Karachi’s situation was before all and they needed to do something soon in order to save the city.
Javed Siddiqui of Karachi Electronics Alliance said that it was so sad that the city which generated 70 per cent revenue for Pakistan and 92 per cent for Sindh was treated as an ‘afterthought’.
Sheikh Irshad of Jama Cloth Association said that the time for talks had passed. “Now is the time to get up and do something.”
Alam Sheikh of Old City Tajir Ittehad said that MQM should take the lead in rejecting the act and the entire trader community was with them.
Saleem Memon of Karachi Electronic Market Association said that the laws kept on changing here and now they had that dark law. “The MQM is trying to stop it from being passed but now it is required that all the traders reject it now,” he said.
Aslam Bhatti, another trader, suggested holding protests before Chief Minister House. “Otherwise it will be like allowing the government to suck blood from our veins,” he said.
Businessman Arif Jeeva said that the business community was non-political but it was being forced to raise its voice against the injustices it faced. “Do not corner us. Do not make us leave this place. We only want our city to prosper,” he said.
Mohammed Raees of Shadi Hall Association said that to him it felt that Karachi was an orphan while its people were disowned even though Karachi holds Pakistan so dear.
“This city is not getting the resources it produces. Gas is one example of this. There is no gas in Sindh which produces gas but you go out of Sindh and there you find gas connections everywhere,” he said.
Deputy convener of Karachi Tajir Action Committee Sharjeel Goplani said that Karachi was a landmark city. “We are paying multiple taxes here and on top of that we are also asked for bribes. There are no new trade or industrial zones coming up here. The ones that were here have been encroached upon. We are made to come out on roads to get our issues resolved. The government does nothing for us. So we need to protest about this act also,” he said.
Mohammed Arshad of All Pakistan Jewellery Manufacturers said that he wanted to see the mayor of Karachi having hospitals, schools, police, sewerage system, etc, all under him. “We are all taxpayers. We deserve these facilities,” he said.
Rafiq Jadoon of Bolton Market said that they were prepared for all kind of sacrifices to make things better for the business community and for it they were with the MQM.
Sheikh Habib of All Karachi Tajirs also threatened to come out on streets to protest.
Javed Memon of Landhi Market, Hakim Shah of All Karachi Tajir Association, Rizwan Irfan of Karachi Electronic Association, Atiq Mir of Karachi Tajir Ittehad and Jamil Paracha of Karachi Tajir Alliance also spoke.
‘Liaquatabad pays more tax than Lahore’
Finally, MQM-P convener Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui concluded the meeting. He said it was a great moment for him to be sitting amid proud and hardworking people who paid their taxes.
“This city is responsibly running the country thanks to all of you. Your views will help us move forward. We can see that tax generated from Liaquatabad alone is more than taxes from entire Lahore. And these are not our figures. These are government figures. But sadly, here justice is not just blind, it is deaf and mute, too. Our courts are more interested in demolishing ‘towers’ but they don’t see the demolition of our Constitution,” he said.
“For the last 10 years, we are saying that if votes can’t help us, the roads will. We are together on one platform in MQM with our traders’ community. It is good to know that we all share the same viewpoint. We are with you at every step of the way. Even if you stop paying taxes as you don’t get services, we will stand with you. There is a common point in your misery. No one in the government cares. We will protest for you. We will protest with you. We will take your grievances to courts. And we reject this act by the PPP with you. MQM’s door is open for you. MQM’s heart is open,” he said, adding that after hearing out the traders they would next hold similar meetings with industrialists and the chambers of commerce.

6,16th Karachi International Book Fair set to begin tomorrow,137 booksellers with 315 bookstalls will participate in the annual event at Expo Centre,"KARACHI: The 16th Karachi International Book Fair, organised by the Pakistan Publishers and Booksellers Association (PPBA) in collaboration with the National Book Foundation (NBF) will be held from Dec 30 (tomorrow) to Jan 3, 2022. 
Speaking at a press conference at a local hotel on Tuesday evening, chairman of the PPBA Aziz Khalid said the journey [of the exhibition] now spans 17 years. This year’s edition is called the 16th because last year the event could not take place due to the coronavirus pandemic. 

137 booksellers with 315 bookstalls will participate in the annual event at Expo Centre 

Giving out details of the programme, the convener of the fair, Waqar Matin, said it’s going to be held from Dec 30 to Jan 3 in Halls No: 1, 2 and 3 of Expo Centre. 
He said the good thing about this year is that there are a big number of booksellers from Lahore taking part in the event. Then there are participants from Jhelum, Islamabad and Hyderabad. 
The inauguration will take place on Dec 30 at 11.30am and Sindh Culture Minister Syed Sardar Ali Shah will formally open it. Writer Anwar Maqsood will be the main speaker. 
Mr Matin said there will be 315 bookstalls at the fair and 137 booksellers. American and UK publishers, among other foreign publishers, will have their book displayed but they themselves can’t come to the fair because of the pandemic. Then there are aizazi stalls for institutions such as the Arts Council, the Sindh Textbook Board, the Sindhi Adabi Board and the Sindhi Language Authority etc. 
Returning to the podium, Mr Khalid said when the exhibition first began, apart from the publishers and booksellers it was the media that supported it. At the time the organisers didn’t have many resources. At the first presser held 17 years back, the media was told that the entire effort of putting up the exhibition was being done under the umbrella of the association. It was to do with the collective benefit of the country, because in those days the situation in Pakistan was not good. No one was willing to visit us. It was the media that owned the KIBF. 
“Through the fair we wanted to tell the world not to associate us with bad things. We also have a book reading culture. A big number of our people, mostly belonging to the middle class, stand in a queue in a disciplined way for a long time to step into Expo Centre [to buy books]. It was important to show that side of us to the world… and the media helped us do that,” he said.

12,"Wasa’s third lagoon yet to be rebuilt, 13 years on",Hyderabad depends on two reservoirs during 15-day closure of Kotri barrage.,"HYDERABAD: During annual closure of Kotri Barrage (Dec 26 to Jan 10), the Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) has to manage drinking water supply to the city through alternative sources because it has not been able to rebuild its third water storage lagoon yet. The rebuilding work has been pending for 13 years. 
Wasa officials claimed that its existing northern and southern lagoons, one with 230MGD and the other with 170MGD capacity, were completely filled and would be enough to meet drinking water needs of the city. These storages directly supply water to the 10MGD and 30MGD filtration plants located off Rajputana Road. 
In addition to the lagoons, said an official, Wasa also installed three pumps of 5MGD each downstream and one 10MGD capacity turbine at upstream to keep lifting water for the city throughout closure period. 

Hyderabad depends on two reservoirs during 15-day closure of Kotri barrage  

This enables Wasa to ensure water supply although some rationing was done during the closure period. “The needs for water supply drop due to winter season, therefore shortage usually doesn’t occur,” said one official. Besides, two storages of 8MGD each Hala Naka and Paretabad also feed other parts of the city. 
Wasa had built an additional lagoon with soil reclaimed during desilting of its northern and southern lagoons. This additional lagoon with a capacity of 100MGD was built 18 years ago, but it developed a breach 13 years ago and since then it could not be rebuilt for storage purposes. 
If that lagoon was made functional, it would also provide an additional storage of 100MGD for the city. Electric supply disruption is causing problems to filtration plants’ working since Sunday and Monday rains in the city. This affects overall supply of drinking water. 
Wasa regularly witnesses transfer of managing directors and when officers from departments other than Wasa were posted there, they found it hard to understand technical and tricky job of the civic body. Wasa employees had been observing strikes intermittently for a long time which was adversely affecting its performance. “A scheme for additional lagoon rehabilitation is pending for execution. Boundaries of two existing lagoons will also be raised,” said an official. These lagoons are located in Karan Khan Shoro village near Kotri Barrage from where they supply water to two filtration plants. The older lagoons also needed desilting.  
According to another official, Wasa lifts water from upstream and downstream when the barrage authorities release entire flows downstream for annual maintenance. “We have multiple systems at Kotri Barrage that keep replenishing our supplies for the city,” said former managing director Saleemuddin. 
He said that when annual closure came to an end and river flows were maintained upstream by the barrage authorities, the water supplies became easier. 
The barrage would remain closed till Jan 10. Its all four canals —   Kalri Baghar (KB) feeder, old Phulelli, new Phulelli and Akram Wah — (one on the right and rest on the left side) would also remain closed for maintenance. Water flows would be released downstream barrage as all 44 gates of barrage will remain open.

“Maulana Fazlur Rehman courageously fought against this selected PTI government. We will get people rid of PTI government soon,” he said.
He said that PTI government delivered nothing to people except for price hike, lawlessness, unemployment, loadshedding of electricity and gas etc. By introducing mini budgets, it was forcing people to commit suicide, said Maulana Nahiyoon.
He said PTI did not know how to run government. 
He expressed his confidence that JUI-F would emerge victorious in Sindh arguing that the ruling PPP also did not serve the masses. “People even cannot find ambulances to transport their dead … they have to use donkey carts for the purpose. Government hospitals don’t have anti-rabies vaccine,” he observed.
He claimed that the PPP government was appeasing waderas and nawabs. 
Khalid Hassan Dhamra, Azam Jehangiri, Abdul Qadir Rajput, Asif Khoso and Ishaq Khan were also present.
