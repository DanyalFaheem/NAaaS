Officials from the HEC informed a Senate subcommittee headed by Senator Rana Maqbool Ahmad that the committee will examine the case on Monday and submit a report to the committee in 15 days. 
The Subcommittee of Senate Standing Committee on Federal Education and Professional Training held a meeting with Senator Ahmad in the chair. 
At the start of the meeting, the committee took up the complaint of the student of Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, Australia, who alleged that his thesis paper was stolen by the vice chancellor of a public sector university in Rahim Yar Khan.  
The committee was briefed by the HEC officials about the mechanism followed in checking plagiarism. The severity of the penalty is directly proportional to the ratio of plagiarism in a research journal or thesis paper, they added. 
The committee was informed by the vice chancellor of the University of Balochistan that a plagiarism policy in the university had been formulated in 2007 and there had been three cases of plagiarism so far. The vice chancellor deals only with the plagiarism of students and faculty members and research journals directly come under the domain of the HEC. 
The committee sought details of plagiarism found in research journals and also directed the HEC to collect details of plagiarism from universities.  
The convener of the subcommittee said HEC should strictly deal with whoever was found involved in this crime. 
The meeting was also attended by Senator Fawzia Arshad, parliamentary secretary for education, and vice chancellors of various universities.

3,"Pims charging up to Rs150,000 for angioplasty, NA told","The cost of angioplasty includes Rs100,000 to Rs150,000 for consumable items for one drug-eluting stent, government says.","ISLAMABAD: Though health authorities claim that free of cost treatment is provided to the citizens in public sector hospitals, Prime Minister Imran Khan in a written reply has informed the National Assembly that patients were paying up to Rs150,000 for angioplasty and Rs23,000 for angiography at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims). 
It may be noted that government employees, who are entitled to free treatment, do not have the facility to undergo surgery and pay the cost through their departments afterwards like the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology (AFIC). 
PTI MNA Fauzia Behram had asked the minister for national health services (NHS) if it was true that heart surgery and angiography were the most costly treatments at Pims. She also asked if it was a fact that government employees had to submit hundreds of thousands of rupees before undergoing surgery and angiography. 
The third question was if there was any proposal under consideration of the government to allow government employees to make payment of surgery after reimbursement from their departments. 
In the absence of a federal minister for health, the prime minister has the charge of the ministry. Special Assistant to Prime Minister (SAPM) on Health Dr Faisal Sultan is dealing with health-related issues.  
The federal health minister (Imran Khan) in a written reply stated that the hospital (Pims) was providing 100pc free angioplasty/stenting to acute heart attack patients from its own budget whether they were from any segment of society. 
“Poor patients are also being treated with Baitul Maal’s assistance. Now we have also started treatment of patients from Sehat Sahulat Programme. The total cost of angiography is Rs23,000,” he stated. 
Hospital charges for angiography are Rs10,000 and the cost of consumable items is Rs13,000. The cost of angioplasty includes Rs40,000 hospital charges and Rs100,000 to Rs150,000 for consumable items for one drug-eluting stent depending on the type of the stent used. 
“The total cost is the cheapest for all hospitals in Islamabad/Rawalpindi both in the public and private sectors like AFIC. No hospital fee is charged from government employees and the payment made by these entitled patients is for consumable items only. All entitled departments have their own medical budget for their employees and reimbursement is made by concerned department from their own medical budget.
The amount spent on the purchase of stent/s and other devices is also reimbursed by the department under medical attendance rules 1990 and subsequent guidelines. The federal government is already providing free of cost health facilities,” the minister stated. 
“The amount which is spent by the patient in case of unavailability of some services/items is reimbursed by the department. However, if the concerned department agrees to allocate a certain amount from their medical budget to Pims, these employees will not be charged for these items. In addition, the government is also planning to introduce Sehat Card for the federal government servants to avoid out of pocket expense at the time of emergency,” the reply concluded.

4,CDA employees also take to streets against local govt ordinance,"Protesters say future of 14,000 workers at stake and their placement under MCI will be resisted","ISLAMABAD: Ahead of the upcoming local government elections, the federal government faced another setback as after the protest of teachers thousands of employees of the Capital Development Authority (CDA) on Tuesday also took to the streets against the Islamabad Local Government Ordinance 2021.
The employees staged a protest at Aabpara opposing the devolution of CDA’s departments to the local government under the ordinance.
Addressing the rally, CDA Employees Union General Secretary Chaudhry Yaseen said instead of taking the employees into confidence the government through an ordinance had decided to shift almost all departments of the civic agency to the local government.
He said the union will oppose the move and will utilise all available options against the division of the departments.

Protesters say future of 14,000 workers at stake and their placement under MCI will be resisted

Mr Yaseen, who is also secretary of Pakistan Workers Federation, said he was enjoying the support of workers of a large number of federations and if a need arose the CDA employees will go for a lockdown of the city and will also stage protests outside Parliament House.
He said the CDA was the developer of Islamabad but during the last tenure of the fund-less local government the city saw its roads dilapidated and streets and footpaths broken.
However, he added, when the federal government last year gave the administrative control of various departments of the local government back to the CDA the latter carried out development works and now the roads and streets have been carpeted and more development works were in progress. 
He said the CDA had over 14,000 employees whose future was at stake and the union would not allow anyone to shift them to the local government.
Trader leaders Ajmal Baloch, Kashif Chaudhry; religious leader Syed Jahangir Shah, Javed Baloch from Wapda Hydro Electric Union, Ijaz Chaudhry from OGDCL, Azhar Awan from the teachers’ union and other unionists also spoke on the occasion.
They promised their full support to the CDA union against the ordinance, stating instead of issuing the ordinance the government should have debated the matter in parliament.
According to the local government ordinance, the over 40 departments of CDA, except the chairman secretariat and the planning and estate wings, along with thousands of employees are to be transferred to the Islamabad Metropolitan Corporation (MCI) within a year.
Teaching and non-teaching staff of all educational institutions in Islamabad have already staged protests against the local government ordinance under which their schools would also be placed under the administrative control of the MCI.
The first local government completed its five-year term in February this year and new elections were to be held within 120 days. The federal government recently promulgated the Islamabad Local Government Ordinance 2021 for holding local bodies’ elections.
The government is planning to hold the elections in March-April. A few days ago, the CDA union through advocate Kashif Malik also filed a case in the Islamabad High Court, challenging the ordinance.

8,Omicron likely to put additional stress on Pakistan's health sector: report,Says gaps exist between public behaviour and the government's response to pandemic,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s healthcare system is poised to undergo significant stress due to the emergence of the new Covid-19 variant, Omicron, despite a decrease in the number of Covid-19 positivity and casualty rates.
This was pointed out in a report, titled ‘Covid-19 Response and Relief Governance Monitoring’, which was prepared and launched by Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) on Tuesday.
Fafen has collected data from 64 districts across the four provinces to generate a monitoring report on Covid-19 governance for a period between Oct 1 and Dec 15, 2021. The data is based on the interviews with key stakeholders as well as direct observations conducted by independent observers deployed in the districts.
While observing gaps in public behaviour and government’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the network reiterated the need to focus on health-sector priorities to tackle threats posed by outbreaks and pandemics.
The system has remained under the additional burden of the reported 48,906 infections with 183 deaths between January and September 2021 from the dengue outbreak.
Also read: 79 confirmed Omicron cases detected in Pakistan so far
The report urged the government to adopt a comprehensive and proactive response to maintain control and safeguard the population against the threat posed by the Omicron variant.
While recognising the strides made in the vaccine uptake process, it states that a significant proportion of the total population is yet to be inoculated and still requires utmost attention as it is the only way to prevent and secure the population from falling prey to Omicron or any other new variant.
The report highlights the challenges in the vaccination process but also underscores the need to extend the vaccination process to far-flung areas of the country.
The misinformation and rumours reported about the efficacy of the vaccine circulating among some healthcare workers and the general population is slowing down the vaccination process, the report said, adding that the government needs to proactively expand the outreach of its awareness campaign to counter the misinformation and rumour and educate the public and healthcare workers.
It also reflects on the declining and worrisome trends of compliance with SOPs at public spaces and offices. Field monitoring of the public spaces shows that the majority of people are not complying with the observation of Covid-19 SOPs.
While public information is more widely displayed, compliance among the public remains low. Respondents in only 18pc of the districts shared that the majority of people in their areas are taking the Covid-19 threat seriously.
The report recognises the government’s proactive approach after the discovery of the Omicron variant.
On Nov 29, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health Dr Faisal Sultan and Minister for Planning Asad Umar held a joint press conference and appealed to the citizens to complete their vaccination doses and announced preventive measures, including curbs on travel from the countries affected by the new variant.

9,Capital admin launches arms licences audit,Bans issuance of new licences till completion of audit,"ISLAMABAD: The capital administration on Tuesday launched an arms licences audit to verify whether they had been issued to the residents of Islamabad or not.
Talking to Dawn, Deputy Commissioner (DC) Mohammad Hamza Shafqaat said the audit would also help the administration in checking the status of the licence holder.
He said the administration had banned issuance of new licences till completion of the audit.
The capital administration issues non-prohibited bore licences only to the residents of the capital, the DC said.
Besides, another purpose of this exercise was to ascertain whether the fee deposited by the applicant had been transferred to the exchequer or not, he added.
Arms licences issued to nonresidents of capital will be cancelled, Mr Shafqaat said while replying to a question.

Bans issuance of new licences till completion of audit

The ban on the issuance of arms licences will be lifted as soon as the audit is completed, the DC said. The administration has further decided to make the arms licensing process online by using services of Nadra, Mr Shafqaat said.
The capital administration will develop arms licences data bank in collaboration with Nadra, the DC said, adding that the data bank would help different departments in getting details of arms and their owners whenever needed.
According to the district administration spokesman Noman Nazim, the capital administration issued 7,000 to 8,000 arms licences of non-prohibited bore.
Officials of the capital administration told Dawn that the step had been taken in response to complaints that licences had been issued to nonresidents of Islamabad. Besides, some irregularity had also been detected in payment of the licences fee to the exchequer, they added.
According to a notification issued from the office of the deputy commissioner, it has been decided to make the arms licensing process completely online, free of human interaction by using the services of Nadra. 
“Hence issuance of new arms licences/weapons licences is hereby temporarily stopped till further order for development and streaming of arms licensing process,” it added.
Furthermore, the assistant commissioner of Shalimar has been deputed to carry out an audit of the licences, it added.

10,Rawalpindi mayor vows to come back with majority once again after LG elections,Asks PML-N workers to prepare for polls as tenure expires on Dec 31.,"RAWALPINDI: As the tenure of the local government is expiring on Dec 31, Mayor Sardar Naseem Khan at the last session of the Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation (RMC) council said his Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N) would come back in majority after the next elections.  
Addressing the session, he said former prime minister Nawaz Sharif will return from London next year, and the party workers should work hard to win the next local government and general elections. 
“I am asking you to prepare for the elections as the ruling PTI cannot win in Punjab due to its poor policies. You have already seen what happened in the first phase of the local government elections in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The fate of the PTI will be even worse in the second phase.”  
Mr Khan said there were chances that the general elections would also be held next year so all the union council chairmen should be ready for it. 
“Inflation, rising prices of petrol and edibles have made the people angry and the PML-N will come to power and put the economy in a right direction,” he said. 
“Though we were allowed to work for only two years, we tried our best to deliver,” he said. 
The mayor said the elected house had approved development schemes worth Rs2.31 billion for the garrison city but the Punjab government did not allow the local government to carry out more than eight per cent work on the projects. 
“Despite all odds, we managed to allocate Rs80 million for graveyards, and spent Rs20 million on the purchase of funeral buses for the Rakh Dhamial graveyard.”  
He said ministers and lawmakers belonging to Rawalpindi wanted to take credit for the development works in order to field their supporters in the upcoming local body elections. But the next local government elections would be a clear victory for the PML-N and the start of a new era of development in Rawalpindi, he added. 
Ruling party union council chairman Azhar Iqbal Satti criticised the PTI government and announced his cooperation with the mayor. 
The opposition union council chairmen offered Mr Satti to join the PML-N to which he said he would consider it. 
Meanwhile, the Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation approved five parking contracts worth Rs219 million which had been rejected in its session held in November. 
In the last session, the elected house had also approved the removal of parking points from the gazette notification to stop collection of fees at six densely-populated parking spaces. 
The mayor also laid the foundation of Jinnah Hall of the assembly. 
He imposed a ban on vendors from installing stalls and pushcarts along Murree Road from Faizabad to Marrir Hassan Chowk.

The webinar was attended by representatives from Friends of Silk Road organisations of Pakistan, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand and think-tanks in Indonesia, Philippines and China. 
Saying the ‘Asian Century’ needs BRI to progress, the speakers called for strengthening multilateral cooperation, promoting the BRI as it represents shared interests of Asian countries.

The nine countries agreed to institutionalise their interaction, counter disinformation and fake news and rejected any notion of a ‘new cold war’. 
The webinar was moderated by Mustafa Hyder Sayed, the PCI executive director. He said BRI had provided an alternative development model to developing countries for promoting human development which before BRI were dependent on the West and its institutions.
Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed, Chairman Senate Defence Committee and Pakistan-China Institute, said BRI through CPEC benefits the people. He said BRI was not directed against any country and termed it a win-win model of cooperation since it was inclusive and aimed to promote connectivity. He said 2021 was an important year in the history of Communist Party of China since it marked its centenary and the year when China eliminated absolute poverty.  
Professor Wang Yiwei, Director Institute of International Affairs, Renmin University of China, said the post-pandemic era was all about adaptation to the ‘new normal’. He said in these challenging times, multilateralism was the only way forward and BRI can be taken as a blueprint to advance multilateralism.

Professor Dai Yonghong, Director Institute of Global Governance and Area Studies, Shenzhen University, said the international environment calls for advancing green development, adapting green business practices and promoting human development. The unipolar world that the United States is trying to maintain is disappearing and a multipolar world is emerging.
