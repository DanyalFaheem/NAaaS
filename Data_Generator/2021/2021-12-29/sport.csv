The Monaco Yacht Club-based Black Jack and the 100-footer LawConnect, a previous winner as Perpetual Loyal in 2016 and Investec Loyal in 2011, were only several nautical miles apart and were expected to finish the race early on Wednesday morning. 
“They are neck and neck at the moment,” Cruising Yacht Club of Australia Commodore Noel Cornish told media in Hobart. 
Hong Kong’s SHK Scallywag100, which led the fleet out of Sydney Harbour on Sunday, was in third place as further retirements cut the original fleet of 88 yachts to 52, with harsh conditions forcing withdrawals due to damage or minor crew injuries — most coming on the first day. 
Black Jack navigator Alex Nolan said conditions had been light early on Tuesday with a breeze of 10 knots. 
“We are looking forward to a good day, to where we will end up this afternoon and evening,” he said. “Everyone is very well. Everyone is very happy. We are pushing it very hard.” 
LawConnect’s position tracker has been malfunctioning, with its location determined instead by radio reports. 
This year’s 628-nautical mile event (1,170 kilometers, or about 720 miles) is one of the slower races in recent memory, a long way behind Comanche’s 2017 record of 1 day, 9 hours, 15 minutes and 24 seconds.

1,KP gain upper hand in Quaid-e-Azam Trophy final,Mohammad Wasim Jr and Test spinner Sajid Khan end up with four wickets each as the defending champions dismiss Northern for 256.,"KARACHI: A day after the rain-enforced washout, wickets tumbled at the National Stadium as holders Khyber Pakhtunkhwa gained the upper hand in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy final against Northern.
Pakistan’s T20 all-rounder Mohammad Wasim Jr and Test spinner Sajid Khan ended up with four wickets each as the defending champions dismissed Northern for 256 on Tuesday, crucially gaining a first-innings lead of 118 runs which would see them crowned champions again if the match ends in a draw.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa increased their lead to 270 after they reached 152-5 in their second innings at stumps on the fourth day. 
A heavy winter downpour had seen no play in the day/night pink-ball final on Monday and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, who shared the trophy with Central Punjab after last season’s final ended in a thrilling draw, had Northern on the ropes early on.
Resuming on 184-3, Northern could only add another 72 runs before they folded with Wasim ripping through their middle and low order.
Sarmad Bhatti was the first to go but not before he completed his half-century as he edged an outswinger from Sameen Gul to substitute wicket-keeper Mohammad Haris. Sarmad hit three fours in his 57.
The other batter continuing from Sunday, Farhan Riaz (30), soon followed — this time Wasim’s pace and bounce forcing an edge to the keeper.
In the same over, Wasim made it 241-6 after Mubashir Khan’s gloved his pull shot and found Fakhar Zaman at leg gully to leave for a duck.
Wasim struck again in his next over. An attempted drive by Rohail Nazir (4) only got a thick outside edge on its way to a diving Kamran Ghulam at first slip before Northern’s last three wickets fell without the addition of a run.
First Sajid, who’d dismissed both Northern openers Mohammad Huraira (51) and Haider Ali (81) on Sunday, trapped tailender Waqas Ahmed lbw for a duck before Wasim (4-65) ended the resistance of Mohammad Nawaz (20) with a short ball that his fellow Pakistan T20 all-rounder couldn’t get away and gave a simple catch at square leg.
Sajid (4-54) finished the Northern innings by dismissing Mohammad Musa.
Knowing their only chance of winning the title now rested on dismissing Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for a low score and chasing it down, Northern gave themselves a good chance when they reduced their opponents to 69-4 before Rehan Afridi (42 not out) and Iftikhar Ahmed (24 not out) steadied the holders’ second innings.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa captain Ashfaq Ahmed (8) was the first to depart when Kashif Ali induced an edge that flew to Faizan at third slip.
Sahibzada Farhan had made 11 in a 45-run partnership with Fakhar (50) for the second wicket before Musa had him caught behind.
Kamran Ghulam was yet to get off the mark when Nawaz rattled his stumps before Fakhar, who had hit nine fours and a six in his 53-ball knock, edged an angling delivery by Musa onto his stumps.
Iftikhar and Asif Afridi (15) then combined for 34 runs before the latter was lbw by Mubasir.
It meant Iftikhar had to play the anchor role as Rehan took charge in an attempt to increase the scoring rate.
While Iftikhar had faced 106 deliveries for his runs at stumps, Rehan has cracked four boundaries and a six in the 61 balls he’s faced so far.
All that has set the stage for an intriguing final day.

2,Queen’s Baton Relay to project Pakistan’s soft image: Sindh CM,"Says sports, education are means to elevate educational and health standards while they also help promote development and peace.","KARACHI: Holding the Queen’s Baton for next year’s Commonwealth Games at the Mausoleum of the Quaid-i-Azam on Tuesday, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah thanked the organisers for bringing it to Karachi for the first time. 
“I would like to congratulate the people of this province, especially the citizens of Karachi, and we’re honoured to have this Baton amongst us,” Murad said after he was handed over the Baton by Pakistan Olympic Association president retired Lt Gen Arif Hasan, who is the chief of the Commonwealth Games Association of Pakistan thanks to his role in the POA. 
“With the Baton travelling through the city during its relay, I expect our athletes, sports fans and general public to show themselves as a disciplined society so that the soft image of Pakistan is projected to our fellow members of the Commonwealth as well as the whole world.” 
The Baton arrived in Pakistan from Seychelles during its worldwide relay before the Games in Birmingham and was handed over to CGA Pakistan by the British Deputy High Commission on Monday. Its first stop on Tuesday was the Sindh Marassatul Islam University before it was unveiled at Quaid’s Mausoleum. 
The chief minister said that sports and education were a means to elevate educational and health standards, while they also help promote development and peace. 
“The sports and education are part and parcel and connect people of various cultures,” he said. “That’s the reason why the United Nations recognises sports as an enabler for sustainable development. 
“As a tradition, the Baton of Commonwealth Games carries a good will message from the Queen and the people of United Kingdom and we thank them all for their best wishes for international peace and cooperation. 
“I truly believe that the sports, the arts and physical activities have the power to change perceptions, prejudices and behaviours, as well as to inspire people, break down racial and political barriers, combat discrimination and defuse conflicts. 
Murad added that sports was beyond any kind of politics and that was why it must be widely utilized for educating the youth and inculcate in them the highest ethical standards. 
Earlier, students of the Sindh Madressatul Islam University got their chance to carry the Baton with former Pakistan cricketer Shoaib Mohammad also present on the occasion. 
“It’s an honour for us that the relay in the Pakistan leg started from here,” the University’s vice-chancellor Prof. Dr. Mujeebuddin Sahrai Memon said. 
On Wednesday, the Baton travels to the Karachi Grammar School before making its final appearance in Pakistan at the Kakri Ground in Lyari. Maldives is the next stop for the Baton.

6,Bismah Maroof confirms availability for 2022 World Cup,PCB announces 36 probables for the training camp to be held in Karachi as part of the women team’s selection.,"LAHORE: While Pakistan batter Bismah Maroof has confirmed her availability for the 2022 ICC Women’s World Cup and will participate in warm-up matches, women chief selector Urooj Mumtaz stepped down as chief selector, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Tuesday.
The PCB also  announced 36 probables for the training camp to be held in Karachi as part of the women team’s selection and preparation for the 2022 World Cup being held in New Zealand  from  March 4 to  April 3.

She has already been re-integrated into cricketing activities and has resumed fitness sessions as part of her post-childbirth rehabilitation at the National High Performance Centre. She will soon commence net practice after overcoming a thumb injury.
“Under the policy, if Bismah is selected, she will be allowed to be accompanied by her dependent child and one support person of her choice,”  the PCB stated.

7,Cavani rescues United in Newcastle draw,NEWCASTLE: Ralf Rangnick accused his Manchester United stars of lacking aggression after Edinson Cavani rescued a ...,"NEWCASTLE: Ralf Rangnick accused his Manchester United stars of lacking aggression after Edinson Cavani rescued a 1-1 draw at struggling Newcastle on Monday.
Rangnick’s side trailed to Allan Saint-Maximin’s eye-catching early goal and were out-played for long periods at St James’ Park.
Cavani came off the bench to bag his first goal since October in the second half, ensuring Rangnick avoided a first defeat in four games as United’s interim manager.
But United remain in seventh place in the Premier League, seven points behind fourth placed Arsenal with two games in hand.
Rangnick had won his first two league games since taking over from the axed Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, but neither performance was especially convincing and this was another underwhelming effort.
“I didn’t like the performance at all. We didn’t control the game apart from a few moments. It’s all about energy, physicality and who wins the second balls. In all those areas we weren’t at our best,” Rangnick said.
“If you want to be competitive you have to get physical and this was not the case in many parts of the game.” United did have the excuse of the Covid outbreak that forced them into a 16-day period of inactivity since they won 1-0 at Norwich on December 11.
But regardless of the coronavirus chaos, Rangnick will know United must improve dramatically if they are to secure a top four finish.
“We have to meet the demands in terms of speed, tempo and rhythm.” Second bottom Newcastle ended a three-game losing streak, leaving them two points from safety after the most encouraging display of Eddie Howe’s eight-match reign.
Although their Covid situation has improved, United still weren’t able to return a completely clean bill of health after Sweden defender Victor Lindelof tested positive on Sunday.
Raphael Varane returned from injury to replace Lindelof, but United looked rusty after their enforced lay-off and Newcastle took advantage to snatch a seventh minute lead.
Varane carelessly gifted possession to Sean Longstaff and he picked out Saint-Maximin.
The French winger showed his mesmerising dribbling ability as he shimmied past Diogo Dalot and Harry Maguire before steering a fierce strike past David De Gea from the edge of the area.
Newcastle were a real threat on the counter and Jonjo Shelvey broke from the halfway line for a 25-yard rocket that De Gea pushed away.
United’s lethargy was encapsulated by a Cristiano Ronaldo miskick that drew a mocking roar of delight from the Gallowgate End.
Rangnick responded by sending on Sancho and Cavani for Fred and Greenwood at half-time.
Crucially, Saint-Maximin should have scored with a close-range effort that lacked the power to beat De Gea.
United finally began to emerge from their shell and Marcus Rashford’s dipping shot forced a tip over from Martin Dubravka.
Ronaldo’s frustrations boiled over as he was booked for a reckless challenge on Ryan Fraser that had Newcastle baying for a red card.
Fraser nearly exacted immediate retribution with a stinging drive which De Gea saved at full stretch.
But United equalised in the 71st minute when Dalot’s cross reached Cavani and the Uruguay striker stabbed home at the second attempt after his first effort was blocked.
It was the 80th league goal conceded by Newcastle in 2021, the most of any Premier League team in a calendar year.
Cavani almost made it 81 moments later as his goalbound flick was hooked off the line by Jamaal Lascelles.
In a dramatic finale, Newcastle’s Jacob Murphy hit the post with a curler before Miguel Almiron’s strike forced a brilliant save from De Gea.

8,England slammed amid calls for Joe Root to step down,Former England cricketers come down hard on England for their poor show Down Under.,"LONDON: Joe Root must step down as England captain after his team’s meek surrender in Melbourne ensured Australia retained the Ashes, former England batsman Geoffrey Boycott said on Tuesday.
“Now Australia are 3-0 up and the Ashes have gone, will Root please stop saying Australia are not much better than us? I don’t mind him living in cuckoo land but stop trying to kid us,” Boycott wrote in his column in The Telegraph.
“If he really believes what he says then maybe it is time he gave up the captaincy of the England cricket team. The facts are staring us all in the face, except Joe doesn’t want to see it. England can’t bat. Our bowling is ordinary.”
Boycott said many of Root’s decisions were wrong, such as batting first on a seamer-friendly pitch at the Gabba while leaving out James Anderson and Stuart Broad who have over 1,100 Test wickets between them.
“It’s every cricketer’s dream to captain England and Joe has had 59 Tests to mould and stamp his authority on this set of players. He has had 13 Tests against Australia with only two wins and nine losses,” Boycott noted.
“Nobody would want to give up the captaincy, but it is not about Joe — it is about getting guys to perform better.”
Other former England cricketers also came down hard on England for their poor show Down Under.
“I’m a  little embarrassed, to be honest,” former England captain Ian Botham  said on Australia’s Channel 7.  “To lose the Ashes in 12 days ... I just  think that England have lost their way. The performance today summed it  up.
“It’s been a walk in the park for the Australians. It burns  me to say that but they have completely outplayed England.”
Michael  Vaughan, another former skipper, said England had not focused on Test  cricket enough.
“They’re a group of players that pride themselves  on competing and they’ve just not managed to find any kind of  consistency or skill,” Vaughan told Fox Cricket.
“It’s not been  easy in these times: the England side haven’t had a great deal of  preparation. But if you want to look for excuses you can, you can always  find excuses -- this [Melbourne] Test match team for quite a while has not been  good enough.
“The focus has been on the white ball team and it  delivered a World Cup, but we’re not a good enough cricketing nation to  take our eye off the ball of Test match cricket.”
Moeen Ali, who retired from Test cricket in September, said there was a massive gulf in class between Australia and England.
“Australia  are just way ahead of England,” Ali told BT Sport.  “I didn’t think the  gap was that big before the series but I almost think it is bigger than  we are willing to admit. I can’t remember many sessions we have won in  this series.”
Ex-England pace bowler Steve Harmison added that  “there  was no fight” and said careers were on the line.
BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew said he would be surprised if Root stayed on as captain while the skipper himself told the BBC: “You can’t start looking at things too far in the future”.
Agnew, himself a former England Test bowler, said England’s domestic structure was not “fit for purpose”.
“The [first-class] County Championship has been marginalised to the fringes of the season for the convenience of playing more limited-overs cricket,” he wrote.
“The ability to produce a solid defence has given way to the desire to hit ramps, scoops and towering sixes.
“The message from the authorities is the shortest formats are the only interesting or exciting versions of cricket,” Agnew added.

9,Boland-inspired Aussies humiliate England to retain Ashes,MELBOURNE: A relentless Australia spearheaded by debutant Scott Boland skittled England for an embarrassing 68 on...,"MELBOURNE: A relentless Australia spearheaded by debutant Scott Boland skittled England for an embarrassing 68 on Tuesday to win the third Test by an innings and 14 runs and retain the Ashes with two matches still to play.
Just when a demoralised England thought their tour could not get much worse, they folded in the morning on day three in Melbourne and will now be desperate to avoid a series whitewash.
England resumed at the MCG on 31 for four, still 51 runs behind, after a disastrous final hour on Monday against some outstanding fast bowling that left their Ashes dreams in tatters.
Their survival rested on skipper Joe Root, but when he fell for 28, it was just a matter of time before the rest followed -- all over before lunch in an embarrassing chapter for English cricket.
Boland, called up as injury cover, was invincible on his home ground, taking 6-7 off four overs, equalling the record for the fastest five-wicket haul in 19 balls. He was later named man-of-the-match.
Mitchell Starc ended with 3-29 as England’s misery was complete.
“It is pretty insane. Just an awesome few weeks, everything clicked and everything worked out,” said Australian skipper Pat Cummins.  “Thrilled for Scott Boland. We have been relentless.
“The bowlers have just turned up and owned their areas outside off-stump. There have been big partnerships, everyone’s performed, everyone’s contributed -- it’s a great feeling.”
Ben Stokes resumed on two but his poor tour continued when he was clean-bowled by Starc for 11. Jonny Bairstow made five and when Root was out it was all over, with the tailenders quickly following.
“It is what it is,” said a dejected Root, who is facing growing calls over his captaincy.
“Credit to Australia, they blew us away last night and they have outplayed us in this Test match -- in fact the series so far.
“We have a lot of hard work to do now and come back strong in the last two games.”
Whether there would be play at all at the MCG was in doubt after four members of the England party -- two support staff and two family members -- tested positive for coronavirus on Monday.
But all players from both teams underwent PCR tests after stumps and returned negative results Tuesday morning, with the first ball bowled on schedule.
England had headed to Melbourne knowing they must win to keep the five-Test series alive after heavy defeats in Brisbane and Adelaide, with Australia only needing a draw to retain the urn as holders.
And they fleetingly hauled themselves into contention on the back of a vintage bowling effort from veteran seamer James Anderson, which restricted Australia to 267 in their first innings in reply to the tourists’ 185.
It was only an 82-run lead but any dreams England had of staying in the Test -- and the series -- fell apart in the face of an intense fast-bowling blitz on Monday from Starc, Cummins and Boland.
In an hour of mayhem, they removed hapless openers Zak Crawley (five) and Haseeb Hameed (seven), Dawid Malan for a golden duck and nightwatchman Jack Leach (0), leaving England staring into the abyss on 31 for four after another stunning collapse.
“I’m speechless,” said Boland, the debutant and England’s tormentor-in-chief.
“Coming here today, I thought we had a pretty good chance of winning, but I had no idea it’d be over before midday.”
Boland was so nervous on his Test cricket debut that he forgot to breathe.
At  lunch on Sunday, he received some friendly advice from Australia  assistant coach Andrew McDonald to add speed to his run-up.
Boland  claimed a modest haul of one wicket for 48 in England’s first innings, before completing a remarkable debut by taking  six wickets for seven runs in England’s second innings.
Boland praised his former Victoria state coach McDonald for supporting him during his first Test.
“He’s been huge. Since I found out on Christmas Eve that I was playing, I have been really nervous,” Boland said on Tuesday.
“Coming  off at lunch on day one, that was hard work. I felt like I wasn’t  breathing at all. I was just so nervous the whole time. He gave me clear  instructions. He knows my bowling so well.”
Boland also received  great support from his home-state spectators at the MCG.
“I’ve never had a crowd behind  me like that,” Boland said. “I tried to soak it up when I was down at  fine leg. I really enjoyed it. It felt like they were pushing me on when  I was running in to bowl. I was just hoping I was going to be good  enough.”
Once again, England’s hopes had rested with Root, who resumed on 12, and star all-rounder Stokes.
Stokes has failed to fire but he flogged Starc for four to show intent, only for the New South Welshman to respond in devastating fashion two balls later with a fuller, tighter delivery that clattered into the stumps.
Root took a nasty blow in the groin area off Cummins on 23 and eventually went for 28, caught by David Warner at slip off Boland.
Despite the dismissal it capped an incredible 12 months for Root with the bat, ending the calendar year with the third most Test runs (1,708) in history, surpassed only by Pakistan’s Mohammad Yousuf (1,788 in 2006) and Viv Richards (1,710 in 1976).
Meanwhile, England head coach Chris Silverwood said he believes the players are responding to his coaching methods despite the defeat in Melbourne.
Australia’s commanding performance in the Ashes series has heaped pressure on Silverwood.
Asked whether the players were responding to his coaching techniques, Silverwood told BT Sport: “I think they are.
“We had a good honest chat after the last game. We just have to put performances together and start pushing back [against Australia]. It’s disappointing for us all and the lads will be feeling that in the dressing room.”
England’s team selections have also come under scrutiny in the series.
James Anderson and Stuart Broad were left out of the opener in Brisbane, while ex-skipper Michael Atherton said the decision to have five seamers and no spinners and leave Mark Wood out of the Adelaide Test was “lacking cricketing sense”.
They made four changes for the third Test with Crawley, Bairstow, Jack Leach and Wood coming in.
“We do know who are our best 11 players are, but we had to make changes after the first two games. We knew we had good people to come in,” Silverwood added.
“We have some world-class players and some youngsters who are learning on the job constantly. We have to try and give them some confidence. We know they have the ability, we back them.
“We have to give them the opportunity to show what they can do in the last two Tests.”
England’s miserable batting was castigated by the British media.
“Gutless England batsmen deliver full spectrum of ineptitude,” screamed The Daily Telegraph, while The Sun slammed  “Clueless England”.

10,Mohammed Shami joins 200 club as India take charge in Centurion,"Shami led the Indian attack with a superb bowling display, eking out every ounce of assistance from the helpful conditions.","CENTURION: India seamer Mohammed Shami claimed his 200th Test wicket and completed figures of 5-44 as hosts South Africa were bowled out for 197 on the third day of the first Test here at the at the SuperSport Park on Tuesday.
India reached 16 for one in their second innings at the close, a lead of 146 that already looks imp­o­sing for the home side on a wicket that will get harder to bat on.
First-innings centurion KL Rahul (five not out) and nightwatchman Shardul Thakur (four) will resume on the fourth day trying to quickly move to a score that allows India to declare and have enough time to bowl the home side out again.
Mayank Agarwal (four) was the only wicket to fall in India’s second innings as he edged debutant seamer Marco Jansen to wicket-keeper Quinton de Kock.
Eighteen wickets fell on the third day after no play was possible on Monday due to rain.
Shami led the Indian attack with a superb bowling display, eking out every ounce of assistance from the helpful conditions.
“Test match cricket is not rocket science. Understanding the conditions was crucial... it had rained a bit and I just wanted to hit the right lengths,” Shami told reporters.
“While coming through the ranks, no bowler thinks about this [getting 200 wickets]. They just dream of playing for India. It’s all about hard work... when you put in the work, results follow.”
His haul included the wicket of South Africa’s top-scorer Temba Bavuma, who had reached 52 when he edged to wicket-keeper Rishabh Pant.
Bavuma put on 72 for the fifth wicket with De Kock (34) before the latter tried to guide a Thakur (2-51) delivery through gully but succeeded only in playing onto his own stumps.
It was a key moment in the game that swung the momentum back in India’s favour and exposed the South African lower order.
All the Indian seamers were among the wickets, Jasprit Bumrah (2-16) weighing in despite rolling his ankle and being forced to leave the field. He returned late on to pick up the last wicket.
“Bumrah is fine,” Shami said.  “He came back and picked up a wicket. Ankle injuries are always painful but hopefully he should be okay.”
Seamer Lungi Ngidi had earlier taken 6-71 as South Africa made light work of bowling India out after the visitors resumed on 272 for three.
Ngidi, who took a career-best 6-39 on debut against India at Centurion in 2018, helped South Africa claim the last seven wickets for the addition of only 55 runs in 15.3 overs.
“The first session tomorrow is going to be key,” Bavuma said.  “The intensity we brought today out there with the ball is what we will require. Hopefully, there will be a reachable target for the batters to chase down.
“If we cant chase it down, then we need to find a way to make it super hard for the Indian bowlers.”

11,PCB clarifies its position over sale of PSL broadcasting rights,Says “the predefined process in the Bid Document was adhered to” at all times during the bidding procedure.,"LAHORE: Clarifying its position over the sale of the broadcasting rights for the next two editions of the Pakistan Super League, the Pakistan Cricket Board issued a press release on Tuesday saying that “the predefined process in the Bid Document was adhered to” at all times during the bidding procedure. 
The statement came after Transparency International Pakistan wrote a letter to the PCB after receiving a complaint about irregularities in the procedure after the rights to broadcast the Twenty20 league in Pakistan were awarded to a consortium comprising ARY Communications (Pvt) Limited (ARY) and Pakistan Television Corporation Limited (PTVC). 
TIP said that that the complainant had said that the granting of the broadcast rights to the consortium was “a violation of the Public Procurement Regulatory authority (PPRA), 2004 rules”. 
It that TIP had learned that Independent Media Corporation Pvt. Ltd (IMC– the parent company of GEO Entertainment Television Pvt Ltd) “had bid Rs3.74 billion for two years alone, while PTV and ARY consortium had bid Rs 2.1 billion for one year”. 
“The complainant wrote if PCB had to approve the bid of the consortium, then it should have been Rs4.2 billion for two years but upon re-bidding, PCB approved the bid of the consortium for 2 years of Rs 4.35 billion,” it stated. 
TIP also expressed surprise at why “despite the experience of 65 years of sports broadcasting, why did PTV not bid individually for broadcasting rights of PSL?” 
The PCB said in its statement that it had invited bids for broadcast rights through a public tender advertisement and had received two bids. 
“Just before announcement of the Reserve Price set by the PCB, the IMC representative raised a concern, asking the PCB what process PTVC, as a state broadcaster, had followed to align itself with ARY. The PCB advised that this query was better directed towards the PTVC who would be best placed to respond,” the PCB said. 
“Bidders were asked if there were any further concerns or objections before the PCB announced the Reserve Price and then opened the sealed financial proposals. No further concerns were raised and both bidders agreed for the bidding process to continue. 
“After which, the PCB announced the Reserve Price of PKR3.584billion for two years in the presence of both the bidders. 
“Before the financial proposals could be opened, the representative of ARY/PTVC stated that their financial offer as contained in the earlier submitted Financial Proposal document was for one year and requested that its value should be considered doubled. The PCB informed the ARY/PTVC representative that a verbal request made at this belated stage could not be entertained in order to modify the contents of the sealed financial proposal. Hence, the request was declined and this decision was accepted by the bidders.” 
It added that neither IMC (Rs3,360,000,000) nor ARY/PTVC (Rs2,108,786,786) could not meet the reserve price set by the PCB at Rs3.584billion and therefore both bidders were offered another opportunity to exceed the reserve price with a sealed revised financial proposal and both exceeded it. 
The IMC offered Rs3,740,000,000 while ARY/PTVC offered Rs4,350,786,786 and was therefore awarded the rights. 
The PCB concluded saying that a bid evaluation report was made available on its corporate website after the Dec 23 bidding process while it had not received any complaint regarding it to its Grievance Redressal Committee.
