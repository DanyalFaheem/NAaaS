China put hundreds of thousands more people under lockdown, while infections hit new highs across Europe and in several US states. Covid-19 surges have wreaked havoc around the world, forcing many nations to make tough choices between economically punishing restrictions and controlling the spread of the virus.
The United States has halved the isolation period for asymptomatic cases to try and blunt the disruption, while France has ordered companies to have employees work from home at least three days a week.
Contact restrictions were in place in Germany for the second year in a row heading into the New Year, as Europe’s biggest economy shuttered nightclubs and forced sports competitions behind closed doors.
Despite facing a much smaller outbreak compared with global virus hotspots, China has not relaxed its “zero Covid” strategy, imposing stay-at-home orders in many parts of the city of Yan’an.
The hundreds of thousands of affected residents there joined the 13 million people in the city of Xi’an, who entered a sixth day of home confinement as China battled its highest daily case numbers in 21 months.
“I’m about to be starved to death,” wrote one Xi’an resident on the Twitter-like Weibo platform.
“There’s no food, my housing compound won’t let me out, and I’m about to run out of instant noodles... please help!” Many Xi’an residents have similarly complained on social media about the restrictions, which include a ban on driving and only one member of a household permitted to go outside for groceries every three days.
This lockdown is the most sweeping in China since the similar-sized city Wuhan was cut off from the world in the early days of the pandemic.
The surges in many countries have been propelled by the highly transmissible Omicron variant, with the Netherlands and Switzerland both saying that it has now become the dominant strain in their countries.
Greece meanwhile reported a new daily record of 21,657 cases, which health authorities said was linked to the rise of Omicron. The WHO warned against complacency even though preliminary findings suggest that Omicron could lead to milder disease.
“A rapid growth of Omicron... even if combined with a slightly milder disease, will still result in large numbers of hospitalisations, particularly amongst unvaccinated groups, and cause widespread disruption to health systems and other critical services,” warned WHO Europe’s Covid Incident Manager Catherine Smallwood.
To hold back the tide, European nations brought back curbs with painful economic and social consequences.
Facing record-high infections, France stopped short of issuing a stay-at-home order but called on employers to make staff work from home three days a week where possible.
Finland on Tuesday said it would bar unvaccinated foreign travellers from entering. Only residents, essential workers or diplomats will be exempt.

1,China slams US after space station’s ‘close encounters’ with Musk’s satellites,"“US ignores obligations under international treaties, posing a serious threat to lives, safety of astronauts,” says spokesman.","BEIJING: Beijing on Tuesday accused the United States of irresponsible and unsafe conduct in space over two “close encounters” between the Chinese space station and satellites operated by Elon Musk’s SpaceX.
Tiangong, China’s new space station, had to manoeuvre to avoid colliding with one Starlink satellite in July and with another in October, according to a note submitted by Beijing to the United Nations space agency this month.
The note said the incidents “constituted dangers to the life or health of astronauts aboard the China Space Station”.
“The US... ignores its obligations under international treaties, posing a serious threat to the lives and safety of astronauts,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a routine briefing on Tuesday.
Starlink, a division of SpaceX, operates a constellation of close to 2,000 satellites that aims to provide internet access to most parts of Earth.
SpaceX is a private American company, independent of the US military and civilian space agency Nasa.
But China said in its note to the UN that members of the Outer Space Treaty — the foundation of international space law — are also responsible for actions by their non-government entities. SpaceX has not responded to a request for comment.
Evasive manoeuvres to reduce the risk of collisions in space are becoming more frequent as more objects enter Earth’s orbit, said Jonathan McDowell of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.
“We’ve really noticed the increase in the number of close passes since Starlink started getting deployed,” he said.
Any collision would likely “completely demolish” the Chinese space station and kill everyone on board, McDowell added.
The core module of China’s station Tiangong — meaning “heavenly palace” — entered orbit earlier this year, and it is expected to become fully operational next year.
Beijing’s complaint about Starlink prompted criticism on Chinese social media of SpaceX’s billionaire founder Musk, who is widely admired in China.
One hashtag about the topic on the Twitter-like Weibo platform racked up 90 million views on Tuesday.
“How ironic that Chinese people buy Tesla, contributing large sums of money so Musk can launch Starlink, and then he (nearly) crashes into China’s space station,” one user commented.

2,Russian court orders closure of rights group,Prosecutor says organisation “creates a false image of the USSR as a terrorist state and denigrates the memory of World War II”.,"MOSCOW: Russia’s Supreme Court ordered on Tuesday the closure of Memorial, the country’s most prominent rights group that chronicled Stalin-era purges and symbolised post-Soviet democratisation, sparking an international outcry.
The court ruling against Memorial International, the group’s central structure, caps a year that began with the jailing of President Vladimir Putin’s top critic Alexei Navalny and saw a historic crackdown on rights groups and independent media.
But the ban against Memorial stands out even in the current climate and would have been unimaginable just a few years ago.
Judge Alla Nazarova ordered the closure of Memorial International and its regional branches after prosecutors accused the organisation of failing to mark its publications with a label of “foreign agent”, the tag for groups that receive funds from overseas.
“Disgrace! Disgrace!” supporters shouted in court after the ruling.
Prosecutors also accused Memorial International of denigrating the memory of the Soviet Union and its victories and rehabilitating “Nazi criminals”.
During Tuesday’s hearing a prosecutor said Memorial “creates a false image of the USSR as a terrorist state and denigrates the memory of World War II”.
The court decision is the hardest blow yet to the organisation founded in 1989 by Soviet dissidents including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Andrei Sakharov.
The ruling came after Putin accused the group of advocating for “terrorist and extremist organisations”.
In a statement on Tuesday evening, Memorial International said it would appeal and find “legal ways” to continue its work.
“Memorial is not an organisation, it is not even a social movement,” the statement said. “Memorial is the need of the citizens of Russia to know the truth about its tragic past, about the fate of many millions of people.”
The court ruling sparked an international backlash, with US ambassador John Sullivan calling it “a blatant and tragic attempt to suppress freedom of expression and erase history.” “The dissolution of Memorial International is a terrible loss for the Russian people,” French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said, adding the decision was “deeply worrying for the future of historical research and the defence of human rights in Russia.” Marija Pejcinovic Buric, secretary general of the Council of Europe, said Russia appeared to be moving “further away from our common European standards and values.” “The liquidation of International Memorial is devastating news for civil society in the Russian Federation,” she said.
Dozens of supporters gathered outside the courthouse in freezing temperatures and several people were detained.
Memorial is a loose structure of locally registered organisations, with Memorial International maintaining the network’s extensive archives in Moscow and coordinating its work. The group has spent years cataloguing atrocities committed in the Soviet Union, especially in the notorious network of prison camps, the Gulag. Supporters say its closure signals the end of an era in Russia’s post-Soviet democratisation process, which began 30 years ago this month.
Author Leonid Bakhnov, whose grandfather was executed at the peak of Stalin-era purges in 1937, said the group’s closure was “a tragedy for Russia”. “What a wonderful New Year they arranged for us,” he said bitterly.

3,Drought-hit western US walloped by powerful winter storm,"LOS ANGELES: A powerful winter storm battered the western United States on Monday, dumping much-needed snow on the...","LOS ANGELES: A powerful winter storm battered the western United States on Monday, dumping much-needed snow on the drought-parched mountains of California, but causing travel misery over a wide area.
Three feet (one metre) of snow had fallen in 24 hours on parts of the Sierra Nevada range, taking this month’s total to a record-breaking 16 feet, and bolstering the badly depleted snowpack that feeds the region’s reservoirs.
“We were definitely not expecting a wet winter,” said Dr. Andrew Schwartz, lead scientist at the Central Sierra Nevada Snow Laboratory at UC Berkeley, California.
“It just so happens that we ended up with a lot more snow this year than we expected, which is a pleasant surprise, of course,” Schwartz said.
Part of the main highway from San Francisco to Reno remained closed on Tuesday for a third day due to record-setting snow in the Lake Tahoe area after a winter storm blasted across northern California and Nevada.
A snow-choked highway shut down on Sunday from the Nevada state line to Placer County, California, although Caltrans said U.S. 50 reopened late Monday for vehicles with chains or four-wheel drive.
And with temperatures in normally mild Seattle dropping well below freezing, Kaety West walked a short distance in the snow from the tent where she usually stays to find refuge at a small warming centre at an American Legion hall.
""Im not even willing to stay in it right now. Its just so difficult,"" she said of her tent.
The US west has suffered years of pitiful rainfall, leaving vast swaths of the countryside parched and vulnerable to wildfire.
It is too soon to declare the drought over, said Schwartz, but “it looks like the western United States is getting some help”.
The immediate impact of the storm was less positive, with tens of thousands of people experiencing electricity outages and roads blocked.
Pacific Gas and Electric reported power lines had been felled by the fierce weather, with more still to come.
“Winter storm system forecasted to bring more snow, rain & wind — electric and vegetation crews have restored service to nearly 50000 customers since Christmas morning and are prepared to respond to potential outages ahead,” the utility said on social media.
In Seattle, in northern Washington state, heavy snow was causing delays and cancellations for travelers, with airport operators having to remove ice from planes, as the city suffered under plunging temperatures.
“After a year of unprecedented challenges, Seattle is facing a long duration of dangerously cold temperatures & snow,” tweeted Mayor Jenny Durkan.
“We’ve declared an emergency to allow Seattle to marshal full resources required to protect residents, provide warm spaces & support our frontline workers.” Much of Oregon was also under a winter storm warning, with a further blanketing of snow expected overnight Monday.
Emergency shelters
With temperatures in western Washington and Oregon not forecast to rise above freezing for days, officials were planning on keeping emergency shelters for longer than initially expected.
Seattle leaders said city shelters will remain open through the new year. At the shelter where West went to get warm, American Legion Hall Post 160, there was room for about a dozen people.
Keith Hughes of the American Legion said the capacity is limited by lack of volunteer staff.
“Volunteers, this is a problem for myself as well as everyone else in town, its really hard to get with COVID going on,” he said, adding there were plans to keep the space open for 10 days.

4,Time capsule found in base of Gen Lee’s statue,WASHINGTON: Workers dismantling the pedestal of a statue of a Confederate general discovered a copper box on Monday...,"

THE time capsule, a shoebox-sized container which was found last week in the granite pedestal of a statue erected in 1890 of General Robert E. Lee, who commanded the army of Northern Virginia during the American civil war.—AFP

 
WASHINGTON: Workers dismantling the pedestal of a statue of a Confederate general discovered a copper box on Monday believed to have been buried 130 years ago, the second apparent time capsule unearthed at the site.
“They found it!” tweeted Virginia Governor Ralph Northam along with pictures of the box. “This is likely the time capsule everyone was looking for.”
According to an 1887 newspaper article, a time capsule hidden in the base of the statue of General Robert E. Lee, who commanded the Army of Northern Virginia during the Civil War, contained relics such as buttons and bullets, Confederate currency, maps, a rare picture of assassinated president Abraham Lincoln in his coffin and other items.“Experts believe there may be coins, books, buttons, and even ammunition from the Civil War,” he said.
A different shoebox-sized container found in the base of the statue was opened by conservators last week but was clearly not the time capsule mentioned in the 1887 newspaper piece.
It contained three water-logged books, a photograph in a soggy cloth envelope and a coin.
The items appeared to have been mementos left behind for posterity by some of the workers who erected the statue. The time capsule found on Monday is about twice the size.
Lee’s statue in Richmond, the Virginia city that was the capital of the South during the bloody 1861-65 conflict, was taken down in September, one of a number of monuments to the pro-slavery Confederacy removed in recent months.
The statue became the focus of protests for racial justice last year following the death of George Floyd, a Black man who was murdered by a white police officer in Minnesota.
During the Civil War, the Confederate South seceded from the United States and fought to maintain slavery, which the rest of the country had abolished.

5,Strike blamed on Israel sets Syrian port ablaze,"The strike caused “significant material damage”, says Syrian military source.","BEIRUT: An Israeli air strike hit Syria’s Latakia port before dawn on Tuesday, sparking a fire that lit up the Mediterranean seafront in the second such attack on the key cargo hub this month, Syrian state media reported.
Since the outbreak of Syria’s civil war in 2011, Israel has routinely carried out air strikes on its strife-torn neighbour, mostly targeting Syrian government troops as well as allied Iran-backed forces and Hezbollah fighters.
But it is only the second time it has hit the port of Latakia, in the heartland of President Bashar al-Assad’s minority Alawite community.
“At around 3:21 am, the Israeli enemy carried out an aerial aggression with several missiles from the direction of the Mediterranean... targeting the container yard in Latakia port,” Syrian state news agency SANA cited a military source as saying.
The strike caused “significant material damage”, it added.
Asked about the strike, an Israeli army spokesman said: “We don’t comment on reports in foreign media”.
Pictures released by SANA showed firefighters training hoses on stacks of blazing containers that lit up the night sky.
The news agency said the containers were carrying “engine oil and spare parts for cars and other vehicles”.
But Britain-based war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said the cargo was “arms and munitions,” which had detonated in “powerful explosions that were felt across the city of Latakia and its suburbs”.
It said it was unclear whether the arms were from Iran or some other supplier.
Latakia governor Ismail Hilal said firefighters had brought the blaze under control by midday and were dousing the embers, SANA reported. It is the second time this month that Israel has attacked the container yard at Latakia port.
The Syrian government’s other major ally, Russia, operates a naval base in the port of Tartus, 85 kilometres (53 miles) to the south.
So far this year, Israel has targeted Syria nearly 30 times, killing 130 people including five civilians and 125 loyalist fighters, according to Observatory figures.
On December 7, it carried out a strike targeting an Iranian arms shipment in Latakia, its first on the port since the start of the civil war.
While Israel rarely comments on individual strikes it carries out on its northern neighbour, it has acknowledged mounting hundreds since 2011.
According to a report by the Israeli army, it hit around 50 targets in Syria in 2020.
In the deadliest operation since the strikes began, Israel killed 57 government troops and allied fighters in eastern Syria in January this year.

6,Hurriyat accuses India of putting occupied Kashmir on sale,Says Indian govt wants to change the demographic character of Muslim majority J&K and disempower its residents.,"NEW DELHI: Jammu and Kashmir Hurriyat Party and other opposition groups on Tuesday slammed India’s recent move to allow non-Kashmiris to buy land, saying New Delhi had put up Jammu and Kashmir on sale.
In a statement, Kashmir’s All Parties Hurriyat Conference headed by incarcerated Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, said it has “strongly appealed to the international community to take cognisance of the systemic demographic change being foisted upon Muslim majority Jammu & Kashmir, by settling outsiders here including through a new policy of sale of land and natural resources to them.”
APHC said that of Government of India wants to change the demographic character of Muslim majority J&K and disempower its residents through such diktats. It said the measures were aimed at scuttling “the final resolution of the long standing international political dispute of Kashmir in accordance with the will and aspirations of its people as promised by the international community, based on principles of justice and international law.”
Since August 2019, in succession one after another authoritarian laws and diktats are being implemented in the state towards this end and “to facilitate the electoral prospects of the ruling party in India as J&K has become its favourite whipping boy.”
The Indian administration was pursuing a divide and rule policy by splitting the population of J&K “on the basis of religions, regions, ethnicities and political interests to fracture political aspirations and voices,” the Hurriyat statement said.
Last week the J&K administration, headed by Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha, changed land use laws and allowed re-classifying agricultural land for non-agricultural purposes.
The decision triggered strong criticism from regional parties, who said the land would be used to settle non-locals.
Recently the government told parliament that only seven plots of land had been purchased in J&K following the scrapping of special status.
Allowing people from outside J&K to buy land in the UT was one of the major talking points for the BJP and the centre, but so far that doesn’t seem to be the case.
APHC said that the situation in J&K is “deeply disconcerting and highly repressive as people are the receiving end of this colonial mindset.”
It asked people not to lose hope but stay vigilant and alert “and safeguard their right over their land and resources as much as possible.”
The Indian government and its handicked administration has held a real estate summit in Jammu (the first of its kind) to encourage people from across the country to buy land, or a second home, in Jammu and Kashmir.

7,Salman Khan survives snake bite,NEW DELHI: Bollywood “bad boy” Salman Khan has revealed how he starred in his own real-life action drama when he...,"NEW DELHI: Bollywood “bad boy” Salman Khan has revealed how he starred in his own real-life action drama when he was bitten by a snake and spent six hours in hospital.
Khan — who enjoys a cult-like status in star-obsessed India — said the serpent bit him twice when he tried to remove it from his countryside home near Mumbai ahead of his 56th birthday on Monday.
Using a stick, Khan said he “picked up the snake with a lot of love and brought it out, and the snake wrapped itself on the stick and then it started climbing upwards,” he told reporters.
After he was bitten, local villagers “screamed ‘hospital, hospital, hospital’, saying that I should be taken to a hospital quickly. There was so much commotion, the snake was a bit venomous, and it bit me again.” The actor was administered with antivenom, kept under observation and then discharged after six hours.
Khan is one of Bollywood’s biggest draws, despite a host of controversies.
He was found guilty of culpable homicide for a 2002 hit-and-run which killed a homeless man sleeping on the pavement in Mumbai.
His five-year prison sentence was almost immediately overturned by a higher court.
Khan was convicted in 2018 of shooting dead two rare antelopes on a hunting trip two decades earlier but denied killing the animals.
The snake that bit him survived the latest encounter, with Khan saying it has now been safely taken back to the jungle.
India saw an estimated 58,000 snakebite deaths per year — or 160 every day — between 2000 and 2019, according to a study published last year.

8,Benazir’s legacy still unfolding,"“Things could have been different if BB were around,” says historian Dr Ayesha Jalal.","WASHINGTON: “Benazir Bhutto’s son would like to continue her legacy but how far he has the autonomy to do so” is not clear, says historian Dr Ayesha Jalal.
Dr Jalal, a leading historian of Pakistan and South Asia, was the main speaker at a virtual seminar on the slain Pakistani prime minister where speakers argued that only an independent political system could bring the country out of its troubles.
At another seminar, also held in Washington this week, Kamran Rizvi, Benazir Bhutto’s adviser on human rights, condemned the trend of branding opposition politicians as traitors and urged all political forces to work together to restore unfettered democracy.
“Her legacy is unfolding as we speak, her son would like to continue that legacy but how far he has the autonomy to do so before a combination of factors both within the party and without,” was not clear yet, Dr Jalal said. She urged PPP to discuss how to revive BB’s legacy and provide people with an alternative to the current system, which had failed to deliver.
Mr Rizvi urged all political parties to work together to stem out those who were “spreading religious intolerance and hate.”
“Everybody is playing politics, and this is addictive,” said Dr Jalal while underlining the difference between BB and other politicians. “Things could have been different if BB were around.
She had a conscience,” she said, adding that “something has to be done” now to continue BB’s legacy.
“We have seen a decline in the very conception of governance. And it has been replaced with formative politics where pretense replaces considered policy and careful implementation so long as it is couched in the language of religion,” she argued.
Dr Jalal noted that Benazir Bhutto also had to make compromises, but she was also “the first to acknowledge that her hands were tied.”
BB did “not abandon her conscience when she saw injustice and felt the need to take a strong moral stance, she did,” Dr Jalal said. “With her gone, it is rare to find anyone asking questions that must be asked of public servants, elected or non-elected.”
She explained how “lynching by emotionally charge vigilante mobs” had become the norm “while the rulers play politics, much as Nero fiddled while Rome burnt.”
Dr Jalal noted that BB’s hands were tied on a range of issues, but she was always willing to create alternative spaces to try and achieve her goal. “She had an acute sense of history and history eventually will have to judge her.”
Mushtaq Rajpar of the Friends of Sindh Society, Washington, who organised the seminar, said it was important to recall BB’s achievements and sacrifices to restore true democracy in the country.
Another speaker, Iqbal Tareen, said that BB had a stabilising influence on Pakistani politics and urged political forces to unite under the banner of democracy.
Another scholar and author Dr Ayesha Siddiqa recalled how BB returned to a country paralysed by Zia’s martial and revived democracy. She argued that like other political murders, BB’s murder “will also remain mystery” but her sacrifice would continue to encourage political struggles.
Senator Afrasiab Khattak said that BB understood the weakness of Pakistan’s political forces, reached out to other parties and played a key role in the MRD movement.
“She also reached out to powers other than the US” and appealed directly to political forces in both the United States and Europe to help restore democracy in Pakistan, he said.
“We are now living in the post-Zia Pakistan with controlled democracy, censorship, curbed rights, disappearances and terrorism,” which had further increased the need for a united struggle, Mr Khattak said.
Kamran Shafi, a former ambassador and journalist who was a member of BB’s first government as well, also emphasised the need for a united front for restoring democracy.
Hasan Mujtaba, a New York-based Pakistani poet, recited his famous poem on Benazir Bhutto, which was also printed on her daughter’s dupatta during her wedding ceremonies.
