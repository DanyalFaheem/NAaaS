0,Pak Refinery unveils $1.2bn expansion plans,"“Daily petrol production will increase from 750 tonnes to 4,000 tonnes,” shares managing director.","KARACHI:  Pakistan Refinery Ltd (PRL) has decided to expand and upgrade its  production capacity at an estimated cost of $1.2 billion, a securities  filing said on Tuesday.
Speaking to Dawn, PRL Managing Director Zahid Mir said the project will double the company’s installed  refining capacity to 100,000 barrels per day in five years.
“Daily petrol production will increase from 750 tonnes to 4,000  tonnes while diesel production will rise from 2,000 tonnes to 5,000  tonnes,” he said.
PRL is currently operating at around 60pc of its  installed capacity, he said. That’s mainly because the demand for its  major product — furnace oil — went down substantially post-2017 as the  country changed its fuel mix for power generation in favour of imported  liquefied natural gas (LNG). The capacity utilisation levels are low  across all five refineries for the same reason.
The government is  now encouraging the refineries to start producing Euro V and VI fuels  while phasing out their furnace oil production capacities.
“The  share of furnace oil, which is currently 30pc of our output, will go  down to just 2pc. We’ll use that for internal consumption,” said Mr Mir.
Producing  Euro V–compliant diesel and petrol, increasing the overall installed  capacity and reducing the production of furnace oil are the three stated  objectives of the $1.2bn expansion and upgrade project.
In the  immediate term, PRL is going to undertake a front-end engineering design  (Feed) study for the expansion project at an estimated cost of $50m, he  said. The Feed study, in turn, will determine the exact project cost  and lead to the financial close and the award of an engineering,  procurement and construction (EPC) contract.
Mobilising resources
Like  all other refineries, PRL has been in a tussle with the government in  recent weeks after it ran out of capacity to store furnace oil.
The  country’s energy managers imported excess furnace oil for power  producers while expecting a shortage of LNG in winter months given its  unusually high international prices. Their miscalculation created a glut  in the local market as the five refineries were left with huge stocks  that power producers refused to lift. As a result, PRL had to shut down  its production on Dec 16 temporarily because of operational and ullage  constraints.
Mr Mir said PRL will easily mobilise the funds  required to undertake the $1.2bn project. “It’s a strong and  economically viable project. With the backing of Pakistan State Oil  (PSO), we don’t see any problem in raising funds because the economics  of the project is very good,” he said while referring to its parent  company that holds 63.56pc shareholding in PRL.
He said the $1.2bn  expansion project will have a 35pc or $420m equity portion. PSO has  committed to providing $273m or 65pc of the $420m equity portion, he  said. “We’ll raise the rest of $147m or Rs26bn through different  sources, including commercial loans, rights shares, sukuk and term  finance certificates,” Mr Mir said.
As for the $780m debt portion  of the $1.2bn project cost, the PRL MD said about half of it will be  from foreign sources. “It’s too early to comment on its breakdown,” he  said, adding that the award of the EPC contract will have the finance  aspect as well. “It’ll be EPCF… our contractor will most probably be  Chinese,” he said.
PRL ran a net loss of Rs378m in the most recent  three-month period against a net profit of Rs282m a year ago. Its share  price increased 2.13 per cent on Tuesday to Rs12.48 apiece.

1,Country has surplus urea stock for Rabi season: minister,ISLAMABAD: Minister for Industries and Production Makhdoom Khusro Bakhtyar on Tuesday said that unlike the shortage...,"ISLAMABAD: Minister for Industries and Production Makhdoom Khusro Bakhtyar on Tuesday said that unlike the shortage of urea stock in the international market, Pakistan had surplus stock for Rabi season.  
“Urea price per bag in the international market is around Rs11,000 while that in Pakistan is only Rs1,800, therefore the huge difference is tempting the local dealers and profiteers to hoard urea in bulk,” he said while addressing a press conference here along with Minister for National Food Security and Research Syed Fakhar Imam.
Mr Bakhtyar advised the farmers not to worry about shortage of urea as the hoarders could not afford to hold the stock for longer period.
He said actual production of urea fertiliser during last Rabi season was 3.17 million tonnes and production during 
current season was estimated at 3.255m tonnes — an increase of eight per cent over last year — which was expected to go up 3.355m tonnes or 11pc higher if the Fauji Fertiliser Bin Qasim Limited (FFBL) was provided full gas.
The minister said that Northern Plants would remain operational till March-2022 and additional gas would be provided to FFBL which would remain operational in the next three months.
Mr Bakhtyar said production plants were showing a daily production of 20,000 tonnes of urea which meant that in the January-March 2022 period, 1.8m tonnes would be available in addition to existing mill stocks of 70,000 tonnes.
The minister highlighted that Punjab has been supplied 5pc extra urea in the first three months while in other provinces supply was even healthier than the last season.
He said in order to stop smuggling and hoarding of urea fertiliser, the government had evolved a comprehensive monitoring system to keep check on transportation of the fertiliser. 
“From November 15, a web portal for monitoring of urea was launched under which all factory dispatches with dealer name, location and truck numbers are entered by manufacturers in real time. Once urea arrives, it is sold at controlled rate by the dealer under the supervision of District/Agri administration,” he explained. 
Mr Imam said the country recorded a bumper wheat crop of 27.5m tonnes last year while due to better planning of the federal government, this year too production would be a record high of over 28.9m tonnes. 
He said as per the target, Punjab would produce 21.9m tonnes of wheat, Sindh 4m tonnes while the rest would be produced by the other provinces.
He said keeping in view the higher prices of urea in international market, there were chances of smuggling of the fertiliser, therefore the government had taken measures to stop the smuggling.
He informed that so far wheat sowing over 96pc of total area had been completed.
To a question, the food security minster informed that prices of wheat and wheat flour in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had not increased due to timely actions of the federal government. 
However, due to poor planning of the Sindh government, price of a 20 kg wheat flour bag had gone up to Rs1,400 compared to Rs1,100 in Punjab and KP.

2,Murad Ali Shah bemoans policies hurting exports,Chief minister to notify a working group of businessmen at CM House to discuss and resolve issues with consultation.,"KARACHI: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Tuesday said Bangladesh’s exports had reached $40 billion while Pakistan’s were stuck at $25bn as our policies were not business friendly. 
“I am going to constitute a working group with industrialists so that their problems could be solved in consultation with them,” he said while speaking at a reception he had hosted for the members of Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FPCCI) and other leading businessmen here at the Sindh CM House.
Around 180 leading industrialists, including SM Muneer, Dr Ikhtiar Baig, Zubair Tufail, Khalid Tawab, Dr Noman Idress Butt, Hanif Gohar, Ishtiaq Baig, Zahid Iqbal Chaudhry and various others attended the event. 
“Pakistan used to export urea but today the country is facing its acute shortage which would badly affect our Rabi crops. I am surprised that we are faced with a shortage of gas, wheat, and sugar which we were exporting,” CM Shah lamented, adding that this was the result of our defective policies. 
Mr Shah said that the industrialists and other business community members were the backbone of this country. “Your [businessmen’s) contribution in the national economy has proved to be a propelling wheel to run the country,” he said.
Mr Shah added that he was going to notify a working group of businessmen at CM House to discuss and resolve their issues with mutual consultation. He further said that he had directed the provincial industries and revenue ministers to start remove encroachments, if any, from the industrial areas of the province. “We would discuss in our cabinet to explore ways and means to reduce the price of the industrial plots being developed in new industrial zones,” he said. He further said that his government would resolve the issues of water shortage, gas and electricity at industrial areas.   
CM Shah urged businessmen to establish export-oriented industrial units so that national export could be enhanced. “We have to invest in the food processing industry, automobile, software industry, medicines and such other export-oriented goods,” he said. 
The chief minister extended good wishes for the contestants of the FPCCI forthcoming election. “I am sure Sindh will lead the FPCCI,” he hoped. 
Earlier, leading industrialist Mr Munir thanked the chief minister for his business friendly policies and approach.

3,SNGPL resumes supply to textile export industry from today,RLNG provision to power plants may be curtailed if domestic demand increases.,"LAHORE: After most stay applications against the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd (SNGPL) on supply to the industry were withdrawn on Tuesday, the company decided to start supplying 75 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) of gas to captive power-run textile export industry from Wednesday (today).
However, an official source in the Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division) said the SNGPL could ensure provision of 75mmcfd of gas to the industry over a long period only if it curtails supplies to gas-fired power plants in Punjab.
“The situation related to re-gasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) supplies from liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals have improved and may continue till the end of this week. However, if it deteriorates in the near future, which is quite possible keeping in view the increasing demand of the domestic sector, the company will have no option but to curtail RLNG supplies to power plants that may cause disruption in power generation and lead to loadshedding in Punjab,” the official, who requested anonymity, told Dawn on Tuesday.

RLNG provision to power plants may be curtailed if domestic demand increases

Answering a question, he said most of the stay applications against the SNGPL on the issue of gas supply to industry have been withdrawn by the petitioners and the remaining, if any, would be withdrawn by Wednesday (today).
Punjab reportedly needs three LNG cargoes in January to meet the increasing demand in all sectors, including domestic, which is presently receiving over 1,000mmcfd of gas these days. The government expects the arrival of one cargo next month, but the schedule for the remaining two is uncertain due to delayed order placement. If no cargo arrives by Jan 10, the situation could get out of control and lead to suspension of supply to all sectors, except domestic consumers.
On the other hand, the Gas Load Management Plan for winter 2021-22 is being implemented following a decision of the Cabinet Committee on Energy. Under the plan, the general industry (non-export) is being provided gas on a weekly rotation basis with one day off for each sector. The cement industry is also being treated on a par with the general industry. The plan also allows five per cent extra supply to gas-fired power plants during winter as compared to last year’s actual consumption.
Meanwhile, a spokesman for SNGPL said the decision was taken to facilitate export industries. “The government, SNGPL and the industrial sector have taken this decision unanimously to keep the textile industry running. Therefore, gas shall be restored from Wednesday morning,” the spokesman said in a press release.
The government, after an extensive meeting with the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association, Pakistan Textile Exporters Association and others concerned, had on Monday announced to provide 75mmcfd of gas to captive power-run textile export industry from Wednesday till March 31, 2022 subject to a written submission from the exporters that they would get the stay orders withdrawn immediately and their energy audits carried out till June 30, 2022.

5,SECP policy board gets chairman after six months,Outgoing head resigned on June 23 for personal reasons.,"ISLAMABAD: The federal cabinet appointed Mehmood Mandviwalla as the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan’s (SECP) policy board on Tuesday after a gap of six months, paving the way for the approval of the commission’s budget for the year 2021-22.  
Barrister Mandviwalla is a corporate lawyer by profession and served as Sindh’s caretaker law minister in 2013. The federal cabinet has also approved the resignation of former SECP policy board’s chairman Syed Masoud Naqvi, who was appointed in May 2020 to head the board. He tendered his resignation on June 23 for personal reasons.  

Outgoing head resigned on June 23 for personal reasons

Since the policy board was operating without a chairman since then, SECP’s annual budget for the ongoing fiscal year could not be approved. As a result, all of SECP’s finances and expenditures were being managed on an ad hoc basis.  The SECP policy board consists of a maximum of 11 people, including five ex officio and six private-sector members. Prior to Mr Naqvi, Prof Khalid Mirza was appointed as the first private-sector expert to head SECP’s policy board in November 2018. Before that, the position was traditionally held by the finance secretary.  
However, the cabinet reversed Prof Mirza’s appointment on Aug 9, 2019 — a decision challenged by him in the Islamabad High Court. However, he later resigned in May 2020. Meanwhile, the SECP only has two commissioners at present, including its chairman, Amir Khan, and Sadia Khan. However, at least three commissioners are required to establish tribunals for hearing appeals against any decision made by a commission’s department.
