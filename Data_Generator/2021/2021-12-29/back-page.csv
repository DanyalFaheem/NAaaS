0,IHC summons official over encroachment on national park land,"No permission was obtained by new GHQ for boundary wall around Defence Complex, CDA tells court.","ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday expressed displeasure with the Capital Development Authority (CDA) for “selective enforcement of law” and summoned the defence secretary in connection with encroachment on Margalla Hills National Park (MHNP) by the new General Headquarters (GHQ).
IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah was hearing a petition filed by an affected villager against ‘illegal’ construction of a boundary wall around the Defence Complex in the protected MHNP.
During the course of hearing, the CDA’s lawyer Hafiz Arfat Ahmed Chaudhary appeared in the court with Irfan Aziz Khan, director general (environment), Faisal Naeem, director (building control), and Afnan Alam, director (land and rehabilitation), of the CDA.
The CDA officials told the court that no permission/authorisation was obtained from the authority for construction of the boundary wall.

No permission was obtained by new GHQ for boundary wall around Defence Complex, CDA tells court

They were not sure whether construction of the wall had taken place outside the specified area allotted for the Defence Complex.
In response to the court’s query, the CDA officials confirmed that no building plan had yet been approved for undertaking construction within the area specified for the Defence Complex.
Last week the court had ordered a halt to the construction of the boundary wall.
On Tuesday Lt Col Kafeel, director (legal), appeared in the court on behalf of the Ministry of Defence. He told the court that the construction of the wall had been stopped. However, he did not explain how construction had been initiated in the protected area.
“The Secretary, Ministry of Defence has been directed to appear in person and explain under what law construction has been initiated and why the IHC judgement that barred the construction in the MHNP was violated by the branches of the armed forces i.e. Army, Air Force and Navy,” the court order said.
The court also directed the defence secretary “to inquire as to who had authorised construction of the wall and to undertake other activities in violation of the laws enforced within the Islamabad Capital Territory.”
The CDA chairman and the interior secretary were also directed to appear in the court and satisfy it as to why proceedings might not be ordered against those officials who had consistently failed in their constitutional obligations to take action against those who violated the enforced laws/regulations and thus infringed fundamental rights of the general public.
The court order noted: “It has consistently been observed in its judgments regarding absence of rule of law within 1400 square miles of the Islamabad Capital Territory and prevalence of elite capture.”
“Selective implementation of enforced laws is intolerable in a society governed under the Constitution. It has become obvious to the Court that public functionaries enforce the laws to the extent of ordinary citizens while the privileged and powerful enjoy immunity.
“The impunity enjoyed by some classes is the worst form of undermining rule of law by the State and its functionaries. This phenomenon is subversion because the Constitution is based on the premise of equality of all citizens before the law. No one is above the law nor anyone can claim exemption from being held accountable when laws are violated,” the court order read.
The defence secretary, the CDA chairman, and the interior secretary were directed to submit their affidavits before January 11, 2022.

KABUL: A crowd of women marched through the Afghan capital on Tuesday, accusing Taliban authorities of covertly killing soldiers who served the former US-backed regime.
Around 30 women gathered near a mosque in the centre of Kabul and marched a few hundred metres chanting “justice, justice” before they were stopped by Taliban forces, an AFP correspondent saw.
The Taliban also tried to prevent journalists from covering the march, organised against the “mysterious murders of young people, particularly the country’s former soldiers”, according to social media invitations.
Taliban fighters briefly detained a group of reporters and confiscated equipment from some photographers, deleting images from their cameras before returning them.
Since the hardliners returned to power in August they have effectively banned unsanctioned protests and frequently intervene to block demonstrations against their austere brand of Islam.
The protest comes weeks after separate reports by the United Nations, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said there were credible allegations of more than 100 extrajudicial killings by the Taliban since their takeover.
“I want to tell the world, tell the Taliban to stop killing. We want freedom, we want justice, we want human rights,” said protester Nayera Koahistani.
In a statement read aloud by protester Laila Basam, the demonstrators called on the Taliban “to stop its criminal machine”.
The statement said former soldiers and government employees of the old regime are “under direct threat”, violating a general amnesty announced by the Taliban in August. The protesters also aired objections to the ratcheting restrictions women are facing under Taliban rule.
The government issued new guidelines at the weekend banning women from travelling long distances unless escorted by a close male relative. “Women’s rights are human rights. We must defend our rights,” said Koahistani.
Video footage posted online on Tuesday showed another women’s protest held elsewhere in the capital that also called for women to be allowed education and work opportunities.

2,France orders mosque closed over ‘unacceptable preaching’,PARIS: France has ordered the closure of a mosque in the north of the country because of the “radical nature” of...,"PARIS: France has ordered the closure of a mosque in the north of the country because of the “radical nature” of its imam’s preaching, regional authorities said on Tuesday. The mosque in Beauvais, a town of 50,000 people some 100 kilometres north of Paris, will remain shut for six months, according to the prefecture of the Oise region where Beauvais is located.
The authorities alleged the sermons there incited hatred, violence and “defended jihad”.
The decision about the mosque, which has a congregation of about 400, comes two weeks after Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said he had triggered the procedure to close the site because the imam there “is targeting Christians, homosexuals and Jews” in his sermons.
This, the minister said, was “unacceptable”.
Local authorities were legally bound to observe a 10-day period of information-gathering before taking action, but said on Tuesday that the mosque would now be shut within two days.
Local daily Courrier Picard reported this month that the mosque’s imam was a recent convert to Islam. A lawyer for the association managing the mosque said that it had filed for an injunction to overturn the ban.
The lawyer, Samim Bolaky, said there would be a court hearing on the appeal within 48 hours.
The authorities said the imam, who the association claims had preached only occasionally and had now been suspended, was in fact a regular presence at the mosque, according to the official document citing the reasons for the closure seen by AFP.
It said the imam had called the jihad, a term for war against the enemies of Islam, a “duty”, and had “glorified” its fighters as “heroes” who protected Islam against Western influence.
He had also labelled non-Muslims as “enemies”, it said.
“The terrorist threat remains at a very high level” and the closure had “the aim of forestalling acts of terrorism being committed”, the document said.
The French government had announced earlier this year that it would step up checks of places of worship and associations suspected of spreading “radical Islamic propaganda”.
The interior ministry said this month that around 100 mosques and Muslim prayer halls out of France’s total number of more than 2,600 have been investigated over recent months because of suspicion that they were spreading “separatist” ideology.
Six sites were being probed with a view to closing them down on the basis of French laws against extremism and “Islamist separatism”, it said.
