0,Tribal districts denied share in uplift funds under Provincial Finance Commission,"In PA sitting, minister insists money was not released due to absence of LG system","PESHAWAR: Despite the merger of Fata with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in May 2018, the tribal districts haven’t received its three years share in development funds, which go to the districts through the Provincial Finance Commission.
Responding to a question in the provincial assembly on Tuesday, finance minister Taimur Saleem Khan Jhagra defended the government’s stand regarding the denial of funds to the tribal districts for development activities through local bodies.
“Why the funds will be released when there is no local government system in the merged districts,” he said, adding that the release of funds in the absence of the LG system is very difficult.
The minister said after the local body elections were held, the merged districts, too, would get the due funds.

In PA sitting, minister insists money was not released due to absence of LG system

He said it was to the ruling PTI’s credit that local body polls had taken place in the province and a system of governance was in place at the district level.
Mr Jhagra said Fata’s merger with the province was a bold decision of the PTI government.
MPA of the opposition Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl Naeema Kishwar, who raised a question about the denial of funds to the tribal districts, said the provincial government had held only two PFC meetings during the last two years though under the Local Government Act, 2013, the commission was required to meet four times.
She complained that the erstwhile Fata had neither been given representation in the PFC nor had it received its due share in development schemes under the LG law.
The lawmaker also regretted that the women had no representation in the commission.
The provincial government had also denied Rs43 billion funds meant for the development activities of local bodies in the previous financial year, which was a violation of the KP Local Government Act, 2013.
In the financial year 2019-20, the share of local bodies in development funds was Rs46 billion fixed by the PFC in view of the local government law. However, the provincial government released Rs3 billion only.
Section 53 of the KPLGA states: “In addition to the establishment charges budgeted for the devolved functions and transfers in lieu of Octroi and Zilla taxes, the development grant for local governments shall be so determined that it is not less than thirty percent of the total development budget of the province in the respective year.”
Winding up debate on an adjournment motion, Mr Jhagra said he was not in favour of giving executive allowance to employees of attached departments and directorates.
He said if the government kept giving that kind of allowances to its all employees, it would be left with no money for development projects.
Opposition Leader Akram Khan Durrani had moved the motion.
He said currently, the province’s pension bill had gone up to Rs100 billion a year. “In 2019, it was agreed that executive allowance would only be given on the basis of performance, which was also approved by the cabinet,” he said.
Mr Jhagra, however, said there had been no progress on the issue since then.
He said the Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal government (2002-07) in its tenure had decided to covert the pension system into contributory one that was sustainable and that the current government would revisit that decision.
The minister said the government decision to allow executive allowance for officers working on scheduled posts spurred many other seats to be declared as scheduled one so as to claim the allowance.
He said the government had in this budget announced 25 per cent increase on basic pay scale, which was later upward revised to 37 per cent.
“We have never promised giving executive allowance to every officer,” he said urging the opposition not to use the house’s floor for propping up such agendas.
Deputy Speaker Mahmood Jan, who was in the chair, adjourned the sitting until Friday due to a lack of quorum.

5,Service tribunal accepts district judge’s seniority plea,Orders seniority for him from 2001,"PESHAWAR: Accepting an appeal of district and sessions judge Kalim Arshad Khan, the Subordinate Judicial Service Tribunal has ordered the Peshawar High Court administration to give him seniority from the year 2001 when his batch mates were appointed.
A bench consisting of Justice Ijaz Anwar Khan and Justice Syed Mohammad Attique Shah ruled that the appellant had not been assigned the correct seniority along with his batch mates.
The appellant had filed the appeal against a letter issued by the high court registrar on March 13, 2021, whereby he was conveyed the decision of the court’s administrative committee to turn down his application or departmental appeal for the fixation of seniority from Sept 19, 2001, when his other colleagues were appointed as additional district and sessions judges (ADSJs).
The appellant has been engaged in around two-decade long legal battle before different forums.

Orders seniority for him from 2001

While he had topped the test conducted for appointment of ADSJs he had not been appointed against the said post whereas four other candidates were appointed through a notification on Sept 19, 2001. He was appointed an ADSJ on Feb 22, 2005, after a bench of the high court had accepted his petition and ordered his recruitment. He has been seeking seniority from the year 2001 when his batch mates were appointed, and not from 2005.
While the appellant was at Serial No 40 in the present seniority list, he will now be at Serial No 2 after this judgment of the tribunal.
Barrister Syed Mudassir Ameer and advocate Hamid Ali shah appeared for the appellant and contended that their client was entitled to seniority with his colleagues since 2001.
They contended that under section 8(3) of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Civil Servants Act, 1973, read with Rule 10 (a) of the KP Judicial Service Rules 2001 the appellant having been appointed in a same selection process as such, his seniority was to be determined in accordance with the order of merit, assigned by the selection committee.
They added that though an earlier appeal of the appellant was dismissed by the tribunal on Dec 8, 2012 on the ground that it was time-barred, but in 2015 the matter of his seniority had re-opened as this tribunal had struck down the earlier seniority list circulated in 2009.
An additional advocate general, representing the high court, assisted by some of the judges whose seniority had to be affected, and stated that the earlier appeal of the appellant was right dismissed in 2012 as it was time-barred.
He said in its judgment through which the PHC had ordered his appointment, there was nowhere mentioned that he should be given seniority since 2001 when his batch mates were appointed. He added that as the appellant was appointed in 2005 and therefore, seniority could not be given to him with retrospective effect.
The tribunal ruled that the record transpired that the seniority list of the year 2007 was a provisional seniority list and it remained disputed because numerous objections were raised against it that remained undecided.
It ruled that the Dec 8, 2012, judgment of the tribunal to reject the appeal of the appellant couldn’t be made a hurdle to his case as the impugned seniority list was issued without lawful authority, so the question of his seniority needed to be re-determined.
The tribunal referred to several Supreme Court judgments and declared that it was a settled preposition of the law that the appointments made as a result of the selection in one combined competitive examination would be deemed to be belonging to the same batch.

6,"‘Lack of transportation, storage facilities limit farm productivity’",Panelists urge govt to encourage investors in agriculture sector,"PESHAWAR: Speakers at a seminar on agricultural development have urged the federal government to take effective steps for facilitating farmers and encouraging investors in agriculture sector so as to ensure food security and alleviate poverty in the country. 
The event was organised by Sustainable Energy and Economic Development (Seed) in collaboration with the Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry and provincial agriculture department at a local hotel here on Tuesday. 
The panelists said that the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa offered tremendous opportunities for the growth and productivity of the agriculture sector, but the farmers direly needed the government’s attention to meet their demands. 

Panelists urge govt to encourage investors in agriculture sector 

The key speakers on the occasion include provincial secretary agriculture Dr Mohammad Israr, SCCI president Hasnain Khurshid Ahmad, former president Sherbaz Bilour, KP Business Voice chief economist Ali Khizar and Seed Programme team leader Dr Umar Mukhtar. 
Many experts, officials of the agriculture department, traders, researchers and farmers were in attendance. 
They identified lack of processing facilities and proper investment in the development of post-harvest value chains as main issues creating hurdles to development of agriculture. 
The other problems which deterred agricultural productivity from reaching its potential were infrastructure limitations such as inadequacy of transportation network, non-existence of storage and warehousing facilities near farmlands and lack of packaging, grading and sorting facilities as well as standardisation and certification support. 
They said Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had the potential to enhance the production of a variety of crops, fruits and vegetables for direct consumption as well as to feed a large number of downstream industries across the country through the development of strong value chains. 
The participants highlighted that the farm-to-market linkages were absent, restricting farmers from improving their productivity. 
Lack of quality control, trained post-harvest labour and knowledge gaps all hinder the processing potential to materialise while limited financial resources and credit constraints exacerbate the environment. 
Hasnain Khurshid said these hurdles were present across most agricultural commodities having potential for growth in KP and required efforts from the private and public sector for improvements. 
Dr Israr said that agriculture was the key to socioeconomic uplift of the province as nearly 80 per cent of the population depended on the sector and related industries for their income. 
Earlier, Dr Omar Mukhtar said that agricultural commodities in KP had tremendous potential in the domestic and export markets, if properly leveraged.

7,ANP flays KP govt's plan to hire social media internees,Alleges PTI plans to spend Rs1 billion public funds on the training of social media activists to work for its publicity.,"PESHAWAR: Awami National Party has criticised the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government for announcing to hire communication/social media influencer internees and warned to raise voice against the initiative. 
Party’s provincial spokesperson Samar Haroon Bilour in a statement here on Tuesday alleged that the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government had planned to spend a big amount of Rs1 billion public funds on training of social media activists to work for its publicity in the province. 
The government, she said, wanted to target the opposition parties through social media. She added that the rulers failed to come up to the expectations of people and it had therefore announced hiring over 1,200 social media activists to work for moulding the public opinion. 
The ANP leader said that results of the first phase of local government elections in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had baffled the PTI leadership which was making all-out efforts to change public opinion in its favour and thus it was taking all possible measures to restore public confidence. 
“The government is unable to dodge the people through false social media propaganda tools because the voters are well aware about the incompetence of the rulers. PTI candidates will face historical defeat in the next elections,” she claimed. 
She said that such tactics on part of the government were meant to pave the way for winning local government elections in the second phase. The ANP, she said, would raise voice against such initiatives at all available forums.

Many tourists visited different hill stations of Swat valley to enjoy the tourist resorts covered with snow after snowfall on the last Sunday.
“Some years ago it was hard to travel to the snowbound areas in Swat as the roads were in bad shape but it is now easy after the construction of the motorway. I visit Swat valley with my family every year to enjoy snowfall and luckily we made it this year too,” said Iqbal Ahmad, a tourist from Lahore.
He said that he preferred to visit Swat in the winter than summer season as he loved snowfall.
The tourists said that every area of Swat was beautiful but they loved to enjoy snow in Gabin Jabba.
“Gabin Jabba, when wears white snow blanket, becomes a combination of attractions as it becomes more adventurous. This year we hiked to the top on heavy snow under our feet which was challenging but we enjoyed it a lot,” said Rozina Amin, a tourist from Islamabad who was with her family members in Gabin Jabba valley.
The tourists said that they enjoyed the natural beauty of Gabin Jabba, which became more picturesque after the snowfall.
“I would only watch snowfall in movies and TV shows and always longed to witness the snow-clad valleys myself. This year I am lucky enough to visit Malam Jabba in Swat. I not only saw the snow-clad valley with my own eyes but also played in it. More than all, I touched the snow and it is amazingly soft and beautiful,” said Iqra Ali, a tourist from Faisalabad.

13,KP health dept complains about slow pace of Covid vaccination,"Most of the students also defied vaccination because their parents were reluctant to give consent for the same, say officials.","PESHAWAR: Two persons died of coronavirus and 38 new cases were recorded in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Tuesday amid complaints by the health department regarding the slow pace of vaccination in private schools.
“We have been able to immunise only 90,000 (15 per cent) of the total 600,000 students of private educational institutions in Peshawar so far. The situation throughout the province regarding private schools is not different where the health workers face the daunting task to inoculate the students,” senior health officials told this scribe.
They said that most of the students defied vaccination because their parents were reluctant to give consent for the same.
Officials said that the Private Schools Regulatory Authority (PSRA) was cooperative but parents were hampering vaccination of their children.
Chief Secretary Dr Shehzad Bangash has also taken exception to the lacklustre response of private schools towards Covid-19 and has directed strict action against those showing reluctance.
“Covid-19 vaccination has been declared obligatory regime by National Command and Operation Centre. Everyone has to receive jabs, therefore, we have been urging the schools to convince the parents or face action in the shape of closure of their institutions,” said officials.

They said that the vacations of schools were also about to start. They said that health teams were directed to immunise the students in door-to-door campaigns. They added that similar strategy was adopted in the mountainous areas where educational institutions would stay closed for more than two months owing to winter vacations.
Officials said that the health department had so far administered the first dose of coronavirus vaccine to 13.5 million (52pc) of the 24.47m targeted population above 12 years of age while the number of fully vaccinated residents of the province was 12.5m (40pc).
“They main issue is that health conscious people have already been vaccinated and the rest of the people are hesitant to get dose, therefore, the government needs to take strictest action,” they said. They added that other provinces were ahead of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in vaccinating their residents.
The managing director of PSRA, Ahmed Zeb, told Dawn said that they had appointed focal person to ensure the vaccination of students.
“We get information from health department and address the refusals by talking to parents. We have shared data with health department and have requested it to inform us before the visits of teams to schools so that appropriate steps can be taken,” he said.
He said that they also took action through the district administration. “We are holding continuous meetings with private schools and urging them to cooperate in the administration of vaccine,” he added.
The PSRA director said that there was a very clear message to the schools that if they did not vaccinate their students and other staff against Covid-19, the virus would emerge with full veracity again and the schools would get closed.
“The only option is vaccination to let the schools operate smoothly. It is a national cause to safeguard the students and staff of schools,” he said.
Meanwhile, the province’s mortalities due to the virus reached 5,924 and infections 181,285, according to a report of health department.
Of the positive patients, 174,818 persons including 48 recorded during the last 24 hours have already recovered from the infectious ailment. The number of active patients is 38 in the province. There are 170 patients admitted to different hospitals and 15 of them are on ventilators.

The women carrying placards reached the Qazi Ishfaq Chowk and staged a sit-in there, raising slogans against the government. They also burnt electricity and gas bills.
The road remained closed for nearly five hours, causing problems for transporters and commuters.
The women protesters said the urban locality was hard hit by gas and power outages. They said they won’t end their agitation until the authorities concerned assured them of ending the unscheduled power and gas outages.
Later, local elders and councilors-elect also joined the protest and blasted Pesco for carrying out power outages in the Lakki city from 6am to 6pm daily, causing water shortage in mosques and at homes.
The protesters ended the agitation after officials of the district administration, Pesco and SNGPL assured them of doing away with the excessive power and gas outages.

Mr Mayar said consumers were unable to pay bills of gas and electricity owing to overbilling and inclusion of different taxes in tariff. He said gas outages were illegal and unconstitutional because as per Article 156 of Constitution a province had the first right to use a natural resource where it was produced.
In Mansehra, the residents took to the streets against inflated power bills in Oghi tehsil on Tuesday and warned that they would storm the offices of the Peshawar Electric Supply Company if the fuel adjustment charges were not withdrawn immediately.
They also said they would take the Pesco to the court on the matter.
“If the extra amount added to electricity bills as fuel adjustments is not withdrawn, we would not only continue to our protest against it but also move the court of law for abolition,” former councillor Munir Tanoli told protesters at Milad Chowk.
Holding banners and placards and shouting slogans against the Pesco and for the immediate abolition of fuel adjustment charges, the protesters earlier marched through the streets.
Mr Tanoli said the people were badly hit by the escalating cost of living and high unemployment rates but the government didn’t understand their misery and was constantly increasing power and gas tariffs.
He said the protest would continue until fuel adjustment charges were abolished.

17,Uncertainty about uplift projects after opposition poll victory in Haripur,PTI claims winning support of majority of village council chairmen,"HARIPUR: A state of uncertainty is visible among the newly-elected chairmen of the village and neighbourhoodcouncils of Haripur about their development plans following the election of the tehsil chairmen from the opposition.
During the Dec 19 local body elections, PML-N nominees Raja Haroon Sikandar and Syed Qasim Shah emerged as winners against the ruling PTI’s candidates for the slots of Khanpur and Ghazi tehsil chairmanship, respectively.
While independent candidate Samiullah Khan, believed to have enjoyed the tacit support of the PML-N’s voters, too, won the chairmanship of Haripur tehsil by a big margin despite serious efforts by federal minister Omar Ayub Khan and his cousins, including provincial minister Arshad Ayub Khan and MPA Akbar Ayub Khan, (Khan brothers) for PTI candidate Akhtar Nawaz Khan.
Though the Provincial Election Commission has yet to officially declare election results, the local PTI leaders, which was upset by the unexpected electoral defeat and wants to show that their vote bank is intact, gathered the elected chairmen and councilors from different VCs and NCs at one of their houses and got them to fill the PTI’s basic membership forms afresh.

PTI claims winning support of majority of village council chairmen

The PTI sources claimed that out of a of total 124 VCs and NCs chairmen, the party’s strength in the Haripur tehsil council made majority with 107 members excluding those yet to be notified as members elected onreserved seats.
They said in Khanpur tehsil council, the Khan brothers had mustered the support of 20 chairmen out of a total of 24 and that they all had filled the PTI’s basic membership forms showing that there would be only a few chairmen and members left in the camp of newly-elected tehsil chairman belonging to the PML-N.
Another PTI source told Dawn that some other council chairmen had secretly approached the party’s leadership to show their support to the Khan brothers.
“The prevailing situation is of great concern for each member of tehsil council, who wonder how they will ensure the smooth running of business when the chairmen of two tehsil councils belong to the opposition camps of a sitting MNA and two MPAs, who publicly announced that the major sources of funding lie with them compared to the tehsil chairmen,” said a VC chairman requesting anonymity.
Another NC chairman quoted federal minister Omar Ayub Khan as saying during the same meeting with newly-elected tehsil council chairmen and member that a tehsil chairman could disburse only a meagre amount of Rs562,600 to each of VC/NC.
He said the purchase of a power transformer and two poles would exhaust the money.
Urging his group’s members to forge unity, the federal minister informed them about the future funding from the Asian Development Bank and other foreign lenders agencies and said the chairmen-elect should stay in contact with him, minister Arshad Ayub Khan and Akbar Ayub Khan regarding ongoing and future development projects.
Another VC chairman told Dawn that though the direct election of tehsil members had brought about a balance of power in the district with Rajgans of Khanpur and Utmanzais of Khalabat Township, the political rivalry indicated that the ultimate losers would be the people of two tehsils.
“If both sides continue with the ‘leg pulling’ of each other against the larger interest of the people in Haripur, there will be no use of our staying as mere rubber stamp attesting CNICs and birth, death and marriage certificates,” said another chairman.
He appeared to be irked by the ongoing verbose and tug-of-war among rival political families over the powers of council chairmen.
When contacted, chairman-elect of Haripur tehsil council Samiullah Khan rejected the claim of the PTI leadership regarding winning the support of majority tehsil members and said the situation would be clearer within a week regarding majority in the council.
He, however, said he would manage his council’s business in line with rules and with the coordinationof all councillors and district administration.
“Though there are rumors about the powers of council chairmen, I am satisfied with the rules of business and will go by the book for smooth running of the house,” he said.
Raja Haroon Sikandar, the chairman-elect of the Khanpur tehsil council, also declared the PTI’s leadership claim of mustering support of majority chairmen as political bluff.
The situation is a bit different in Ghazi tehsil, where the PTI’s former district leadership and assembly members evinced little interest in the election helping PML-N candidate Syed Qasim Shah become the tehsil chairman. The PTI nominee stood third in the election.
