0,PTI special panel decides to revive party’s old constitution,Report to be submitted to Prime Minister Imran Khan for approval.,"ISLAMABAD: A special committee constituted by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chairman and Prime Minister Imran Khan last week to review the party’s organisational structure has decided to revoke the present constitution of the party and revive the previous one adopted in 2015 with a few changes aimed at strengthening the party at grassroots level.
The committee has recommended that the party should have five tiers instead of seven and make provincial constituencies as the new tier in place of tehsils.
These details were provided to Dawn by Minister for Information Fawad Chaudhry, who is also a part of the newly formed 21-member committee.
He said the main committee had then formed a subcommittee under the newly nominated secretary general of the party, Asad Umar, for this purpose which completed its task on Tuesday. The report would now be submitted to the party chairman and the main committee for final approval.

Report to be submitted to Imran for approval

“We have suggested that the 2019 constitution of the party should be revoked and we should go back to the constitution that had been adopted by the party in 2015 with certain changes,” said Mr Chaudhry, who is also a member of the subcommittee that finalised its recommendations.
He said the purpose of reviewing the party’s organisational structure through changes in the constitution was to reorganise and prepare the party for the upcoming local government elections in the provinces and, ultimately, the next general elections.
The other members of the subcommittee include PTI’s additional secretary general Aamer Mehmood Kiani, Punjab Governor Chaudhry Muhammad Sarwar, Sindh Governor Imran Ismail and Minister for Maritime Affairs Ali Haider Zaidi.
After the general elections in 2013, the PTI introduced a new party structure under which Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were divided into four regions — each with no office-bearers at the provincial level. Later, the same structure based on regions was maintained in the new constitution adopted by the party in 2019 and Sindh and Balochistan were also divided into four regions.
After the shocking defeat of the party in the first phase of the local government elections in its stronghold Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on December 19, Imran Khan in his capacity as the PTI chairman dissolved the party’s organisational structure across the country and formed a committee to review the constitution.
The dissolution of the PTI’s organisations from the centre to the tehsil level across the country had been announced by Fawad Chaudhry at a news conference in Islamabad on December 24. The next day, the prime minister nominated new office-bearers of the party at the central and provincial levels, reviving the eight-year-old party structure.
Mr Khan appointed Minister for Planning and Development Asad Umar as the central secretary general in place of MNA Kiani, who has been made the additional secretary general.
Minister for Education and Professional Training Shafqat Mahmood was made the president of the party’s central Punjab chapter and Minister for Industries and Production Khusro Bakhtyar the president of the PTI’s south Punjab chapter. Mr Zaidi became the president of PTI’s Sindh chapter, whereas Defence Minister Pervez Khattak was given the responsibility to reorganise the party in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. National Assembly Deputy Speaker Qasim Suri was nominated as president of the party’s Balochistan chapter.
The new nominations show that Mr Khan has abolished the party’s organisational structure as given in the 2019 constitution and appointed office-bearers at the central and provincial levels. There have been no changes in the party’s structures in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan chapters so far.
Fawad Chaudhry earlier said Imran Khan had made these nominations temporarily by using his special powers as the party chairman. He said this “interim set-up” would continue to function until the party had a new constitution.

1,PPP assails approval of security policy without parliament’s input,Senator Raza Rabbani says the government had pledged to place the security policy before parliament.,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) has expressed concern over the government’s act of bypassing parliament in the formulation of the country’s first National Security Policy.
PPP Senator Raza Rabbani said in a statement on Tuesday that the National Security Policy, which had been first approved by the National Security Committee (NSC) on Monday and the next day by the federal cabinet, was denied any input from parliament.
He recalled that the government had promised to share the details of its agreement with the-then banned Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan at an appropriate time, but this never happened.
Similarly, he said, the government had pledged to place the security policy before parliament, but it was not taken into confidence on this most crucial national issue.
While approving the policy, the NSC headed by Prime Minister Imran Khan put economic stability at the core of the comprehensive national security. The NSC meeting had been attended by the ministers for foreign affairs, defence, information and broadcasting, interior, finance and human rights, the national security adviser, services chiefs and senior officials.
The five-year policy document covering the period 2022-26 is being flaunted by the government as the first-ever strategy paper of its kind that sets out the state’s national security vision and guidelines for attainment of those goals. It will guide government’s foreign, defence and economic policies and decision-making.
Although the policy will be shared publicly at a later stage, it reportedly seeks to leverage the symbiotic linkages among human security, economic security and military security with safety and prosperity of citizens being at the centre of the whole-of-government approach.
It covers both traditional and non-traditional security challenges, including economy, food, water, military security, terrorism, population growth and dealings with the external world, especially major powers.
A draft of the policy was earlier this month shared with the Par­liamentary Committee on National Security headed by National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser. The opposition parties, however, had boycotted the meeting while questioning the credibility of National Security Adviser Dr Moeed Yousuf.

The Senate Standing Commission on Law and Justice had on December 23 also summoned the inspectors general police and home secretaries of all the provinces as well as the Islamabad administration to seek details about implementation of the new anti-rape law.
Senator Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, who presided over the Senate committee’s meeting, had lauded the government’s efforts in promulgating the anti-rape law and highlighted that the main objection in the past had always been about its implementation.
The Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) Act 2021 recently passed by parliament seeks to establish special courts and use of modern devices during the investigation and trial of rape cases. The special committee can also issue appropriate directives from time to time to Nadra to prepare a register of sex offenders the details of which will only be provided to a court of law or a law enforcement agency.

The special court’s judge will have the same powers and jurisdiction as the sessions court and will be appointed for a period of three years but could be transferred to another special court within the same province.
Anti-rape crisis cells will also be established throughout the country. The cell will be headed by the commissioner or deputy commissioner of the area concerned as deemed fit by the prime minister and will also comprise the medical superintendent of a public hospital and the district police officer or a police officer heading a division.

3,"No secret deal on Reko Diq project, says CM Bizenjo",Says the rights and interests of Balochistan will be protected in any new deal.,"QUETTA: Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo has rejected allegations of opposition parties that a secret deal has been signed on Reko Diq gold project by the provincial government.
“Elected representatives of the opposition and government have been given a detailed briefing on the progress made so far on Reko Diq project,” the chief minister said, adding that rights and interests of Balochistan would be protected in any new deal.
Speaking to journalists after inaugurating the first parking plaza in the provincial capital on Tuesday, Mr Bizenjo said in the in-camera session of the Balochistan Assembly, lawmakers had been informed about the important project in detail.
He said that members of the opposition and treasury benches had appreciated the government’s move to hold the in-camera briefing on the gold project as it fulfilled the demand of the opposition parties on the issue.
The chief minister said that nothing had been kept secret from the lawmakers as the present government did not believe in taking decisions in rooms with doors shut.
Mr Bizenjo said the government had lost the case in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and a huge fine had been imposed on the federal and Balochistan governments.
He said that in the earlier agreement signed by the previous government in the 90s, the share of Balochistan was not clear and the province had been included in that accord on the basis of 25 per cent equity.
In the new agreement to be signed soon, he said, the Balochistan government was trying to get at least 25pc share in the profits.
“It is our desire to get maximum share for the province in the agreement which is yet to be finalised,” the chief minister said.

A project of the Quetta Metropolitan Corporation, it has been completed in more than 12 years at a cost of Rs1.02 billion due to negligence of the authorities concerned and lack of funds.
The parking plaza has six floors which will accommodate more than 600 cars and 678 motorcycles. Its construction will reduce traffic jams in Quetta.
The commercial areas of the city have been facing traffic pressure since long with its population of 3.5 million.
Speaking at the inaugural ceremony, the chief minister said the Quetta city had been facing traffic problems because there were no parking facilities. The population of Quetta had increased manifold but the roads and other civic facilities were not expanded accordingly, he added.
Mr Bizenjo said his government was trying to resolve the basic issues of the people and provide maximum facilities to them.
He said initially the parking plaza would allow people to park their vehicles for free. Later, the plaza would be given over to a contractor, he added.
