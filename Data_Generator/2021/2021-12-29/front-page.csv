• Claims Rana Shamim’s affidavit issue shows how strong ‘Sicilian mafia’ is
ISLAMABAD: Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry on Tuesday said the government would bring back self-exiled former prime minister Nawaz Sharif to the country as he would never return himself, insisting that the opposition was incapable of toppling the present setup led by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI).
Speaking at a joint press conference with National Security Adviser Dr Moeed Yusuf after a meeting of the federal cabinet, the minister said: “Nawaz Sharif will never return home voluntarily, rather the government will bring him back once the agreement with the UK government is finalised.”
The recent statement of former National Assembly speaker Ayaz Sadiq that he was going to London to bring Nawaz Sharif back had gotten the Sharif family in Jati Umra worried, Mr Chaudhry said, adding that the government had finalised matters with the United Kingdom regarding the return of Nawaz Sharif.
“The opposition parties cannot overthrow the present democratically elected government with their so-called protest movement,” he said, claiming that only [Prime Minister] Imran Khan could act as real opposition.
“Real leadership is required for agitation in politics, which the opposition lacks,” the minister said, adding that the opposition leaders were giving false hopes to their party workers.
When pointed out that Jamiat-i-Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman had given a call for long march which he claimed would lead to the fall of the government, the minister said the Maulana had been giving such calls for the last three years.
“Maulana Fazl reached Islamabad with his supporters in the very first year of the PTI’s tenure with the false hope that the government would be toppled; since then, he has been giving dates,” he said.
Commenting on former chief judge of Gilgit-Baltistan Rana Shamim’s affidavit filed before the Islamabad High Court, Mr Chaudhry said this showed how strong the Sicilian mafia — Nawaz Sharif and family — was as it had even hatched conspiracy against the judiciary.
Responding to a question, the information minister said the government was forced to go to the International Monetary Fund due to the loot and plunder committed by Pakistan Peoples Party co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz supremo Nawaz Sharif.
He said the opposition should come up with an alternative solution if they had any instead of merely resorting to point-scoring. Prime Minister Imran Khan, the minister said, had laid the foundation of a government based on transparency, and the assets of politicians and their families were in full public view.

1,79 confirmed Omicron cases detected in Pakistan so far,Member of Covid-19 task force suggests govt should tighten restrictions and limit the number of participants in indoor events.,"ISLAMABAD: While the most transmissible new variant of Covid-19 has reached over 100 countries, Pakistan on Tuesday announced that so far 79 confirmed cases of Omicron had been reported across the country out of which 85 per cent was of local transmission.
Dr Javed Akram, a member of the National Scientific Task Force on Covid-19, suggested that the government tighten restrictions and limit the number of participants of indoor events such as weddings to curb Omicron.
A statement issued by the National Institute of Health (NIH) said that since the World Health Organisation had designated Omicron as a variant of concern on November 26, the Ministry of National Health Services, National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC), NIH and provincial health departments remained vigilant to detect the new variant in Pakistan.
“The first case of Omicron was reported on December 13 in Karachi. As of December 27, a total of 75 Omicron cases have been confirmed, (including) 33 in Karachi, 17 in Islamabad and 13 in Lahore. Twelve cases were associated with international travel. The relevant authorities have isolated the patients and initiated contact tracing in order to control the spread of the variant,” it stated.

 



 

First case was reported in Karachi on Dec 13

Four more cases of Omicron were reported from Islamabad on Tuesday, taking the city’s tally to 21.
“Vaccination and SOPs (standard operating procedures) continue to be our best defence against Covid-19 despite the mutations being reported. All government-approved Covid-19 vaccines available in Pakistan remain highly effective at preventing severe disease and hospitalisation. The government urges everyone to get both doses of Covid-19 vaccine as well as the booster dose as per the eligibility criteria and process. More details are available at the NCOC website (ncoc.gov.pk) and Sehat Tahaffuz Helpline (1166),” statement said.
Dr Javed Akram, who is also Vice Chancellor of University of Health Sciences, told Dawn that according to principle of public health, only a proportion of disease is detected. “So there can be some of the cases which could not be detected. As Omicron is the most transmissible variant so I suggest that restrictions should be tightened. Unfortunately, wedding season is going on due to which around 500 guests are gathered in a hall and no one, including bride and groom, wears a mask. I suggest that the number of indoor guests should be decreased. We should sacrifice our desires rather than wishes,” he said.
“People should get themselves vaccinated and strictly adhere to the SOPs. Omicron came from Africa and I fear that more variants may arrive from there because there is very low vaccination rate in the continent. Omicron is more transmissible as compared to Delta, but luckily it is not as virulent as Delta,” Dr Akram said.
According to sources, a person, who arrived from the UAE to Islamabad on December 25, was detected with Omicron. Similarly, a woman, who arrived from abroad, was found positive. Two persons in Bahara Kahu area of the federal capital tested positive for Omicron. This proves that local transmission of the virus has increased.
Islamabad District Health Officer Dr Zaeem Zia said Omicron was highly transmissible and suggested that the masses get themselves vaccinated at the earliest. “Vaccine is the only shield against the virus as it reduces chances of health complications in case of infection,” he said.
According to the NCOC data, 291 Covid-19 cases and three deaths were reported across the country over the past 24 hours, with national positivity rate at 0.69pc. As many as 636 patients were on critical care on Tuesday.

2,"Rs2bn power theft loss in Railways every year, says minister","Azam Swati says electricity is being stolen in connivance with Wapda officials, calls for installation of electricity meters.","ISLAMABAD: Railways Minister Azam Khan Swati on Tuesday informed a Senate committee that Pakistan Railways (PR) has been suffering a loss of Rs2 billion annually due to electricity theft.
He told a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Railways presided over by Mohammad Qasim at the Parliament House that electricity was being stolen in connivance with officials of the Water and Power Development Authority and it could be stopped only by installing over 54,000 electricity meters.
The meeting discussed the proposed Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) and future strategies of Pakistan Railways.
Deputy Chairman of the Senate Mirza Mohammad Afridi, Senators Dost Mohammad Khan and Mushahid Hussain Sayed, senior officers of the railways ministry and other officials also attended the meeting.
The committee ratified Senator Faisal Saleem Reh­man as member of the Rai­lway Advisory Committee.
Mr Afridi urged the railways ministry to launch fast passenger and freight trains as there was a cargo business worth billions in the country and if Pakistan Railways could get 30 per cent of it the financial position of the organisation would change.
While reviewing details of the PSDP’s tentative allocation of Rs35 billion for 2022-23, Mr Swati informed the meeting of the strides Pakistan Railways had taken in the past 10 months.
The minister urged the committee to fully support the PSDP package so that the railways could be revived. He said that if the provinces played their part, the sector could be revolutionised, spreading business and trade opportunities far and wide.
He said the Taftan-Quetta track would be restored if the Balochistan government gave Rs15bn out of Rs600bn and the federal government would bear the remaining amount which will help development of the province also.
Mr Swati said Pakistan Railways had started a freight train service to connect Islamabad with Tehran and Istanbul and also planned to start a passenger train on this route.
He said the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government was restoring the old track from Peshawar to Torkham.
The minister told the committee that Pakistan Railways was controlled by the mafia and tenders for more than 1,500 trains were awarded to one man.
He informed the committee of plans to develop the Afghan-Pakistan transit trade route.
He said that tourism would be enhanced if historical railway routes and stations were revived.
Mr Swati invited the members of the Senate and the National Assembly committees to visit the railway stations and give suggestions for building hotels, hostels or markets.
He informed the committee that once completed the Rs220bn Karachi Circular Railway project would revolutionise commuting in the metropolis. He said the seed money had been arranged for its completion in 36 months.
The minister said Pakistan Railways would dynamically pursue the expansion of routes and take these beyond borders. It planned to develop the Chaman-Kandahar route and the Havelian-Kashgar route to promote international trade.
The committee lauded the efforts of the ministry despite lack of funds and assured it of its complete support.

3,Top ex-GB judge Rana Shamim asked to become approver in affidavit case,"“I think he can clear his position even at this point of time,"" says Attorney General Khalid Jawed Khan.","ISLAMABAD: The principal law officer of the country extended an olive branch to former chief judge of Gilgit-Baltistan Rana Shamim on Tuesday as he asked him to become an “approver” to get himself exonerated in the affidavit case.
Meanwhile, the Islam­abad High Court (IHC) decided to indict all alleged contemnors on Jan 7 in the case which relates to the affidavit that accuses former chief justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar of manipulating judicial proceedings.
During the hearing of the contempt of court case against Mr Shamim, Editor-in-Chief of Jang Group Mir Shakeel-ur-Rehman, Resident Editor of The News Aamir Ghouri and Editor Investigation Ansar Abbasi, Attorney General (AG) Khalid Jawed Khan said that the former GB top judge was the principal contemnor in the affidavit case.
The AG said that he had not been appointed a prosecutor in the case and he still considered Mr Shamim a respectable citizen. “I think he can clear his position even at this point of time.”
He then offered: “if he [Mr Shamim] is ready to tender an apology, admits that he was used as a pawn and discloses the name of the beneficiary, I would request the court to pardon him.”
Without mentioning a story published in an English daily that claimed that the affidavit was executed in the office of PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif, IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah said that there was some development in this case as well.
On the other hand, Mr Shamim’s counsel Abdul Latif Afridi said that the news report had been contradicted and his client and Ansar Abbasi could file a contempt petition against the newspaper.
Talking to Dawn, Mr Shamim said that the affidavit was executed in the Notary Public office in London where no other person, including Mr Sharif, was present.
Syed Amjad Shah, representative of Pakistan Bar Council, suggested in the court that after Mr Shamim had submitted original copy of the affidavit, the court should seek a counter-affidavit from the former CJP.
Mr Abbasi argued that the case fell within the ambit of press freedom and expressed apprehension that any adverse verdict would be detrimental to the press freedom in Pakistan.
Justice Minallah said that he had never authored any judgement against the media freedom.
“I do not believe in powers of contempt”, remarked the IHC chief justice.
Mr Afridi referred to two judgements; one authored by Justice Minallah in the contempt proceedings against former information minister Dr Firdaus Ashiq Awan and another by the apex court against PTI leader Imran Khan in the 2014 contempt of court case; and recalled that in both cases the alleged contemnors were pardoned.
He requested the court to show restraint in the affidavit case as well.
However, Justice Minallah said that the affidavit had cast aspersions on all judges of the IHC. He referred to a pending petition of the Ministry of Law and Justice for implementation of the International Court of Justice order about Indian spy Kalbhushan Jadhav and said that if they created an impression that courts in Pakistan were compromised, how India could concede jurisdiction of Pakistani courts.
Mr Afridi responded that his client had no intention of committing contempt and was also unaware of consequences.
The court asked Resident Editor of The News Aamir Ghouri about publishing a report on the basis of an affidavit which was claimed to be a privileged document by the author.
Mr Ghouri responded that it was the responsibility of a journalist to file a story in public interest.
Justice Minallah reminded him that it was against international journalistic ethics if someone wrote a story to manipulate the pending proceeding.
The court postponed further hearing till Jan 7.

4,Tabling of mini-budget in parliament deferred,Information minister says cabinet wants a threadbare discussion on it before presenting it to parliament for passage.,"ISLAMABAD: The federal cabinet on Tuesday approved the first-ever National Security Policy (NSP) of the country but deferred approval of the supplementary finance bill [mini-budget] which was scheduled to be tabled in the National Assembly on Wednesday (today).
In a significant decision, the cabinet ordered publication of members of parliament (MPs) 2019 tax directory and observed that “no other sector has as much accountability as politicians”.
“The cabinet deferred [approval of] the [supplementary finance] bill today as it wants a threadbare discussion on it before presenting it to the parliament for passage,” Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said in a post-cabinet meeting press conference. He said a special meeting of the cabinet would be held soon on a one-point agenda — the supplementary finance bill. He said the bill would be presented in the current session of the parliament and an initial discussion on the draft was held in the cabinet meeting.

Cabinet approves National Security Policy; orders publication of parliament members tax directory

National Security Policy
The minister said the federal cabinet had approved the country’s first-ever NSP which was unveiled by the high-powered National Security Committee on Monday with Prime Minister Imran Khan in the chair.
“It is for the first time that economic strategy has been linked with geostrategic policy because if economy of a country is not strong, its security cannot be guaranteed. Until the common man is satisfied with the economic, social and legal situation, the security of the country will remain in danger,” he said.
Describing salient features of the policy, the minister said the document would be shared with the media within 10 days, adding that the National Security Policy focused on the common man.
The work on the policy, he said, was started in 2014 and the policy got approval in 2021, which means it took almost nine years for its preparation after input from 18 different ministries.
The minister claimed that there had never been a consensus on national security policy and it was for the first time that the present government had incorporated points of view of all stakeholders.
“For the first time we have passed an important milestone under the leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan,” he added.
He said policies of other related ministries, including internal policy and food security policy, were also linked with the National Security Policy.
Speaking at the same press conference, National Security Adviser (NSA) Dr Moeed Yusuf termed the NSP the country’s first ever comprehensive citizen-centric security policy based on economic security. “I would like to congratulate the nation on this successful endeavor because if any country has unclear national security vision, then policy making under it is very difficult,” he added.
“The policy focuses on overall aspects of national security and it has been decided that economic security would be the core of the policy. Strong economy would ensure more spending on military and human security,” he added.
Underlining the need for external initiatives, he said the policy’s objective was peace. “Search of peace in the neighborhood and all other countries.”
Mr Yusuf said: “We are an Islamic state and have an ideology of an Islamic country. Therefore, the policy aspects of national cohesion should revolve around the nation’s diversity. All aspects of diversity would be taken along with other elements of NSP.”
He said human security aspects of NSP had core focus on population followed by health security, climate, water, food security and gender.
The main points, he said, like external imbalance, export and import issues leading to increased current account deficit, energy security and education, were included in economy as education’s one component -- namely unity and radicalisation -- was related to national security.
The NSA said the second important concern of Pakistan was to produce quality human resources that would cast ultimate impact on economy at the local level and this was discussed under the chapter of economic security.
The other elements of the policy shed light on sovereignty and territorial integrity meaning hard security related to defence and military security.
Pointing towards criticism over absence of private sector, academia and experts from formulation of the policy, Di Yusuf said over 600 experts hailing from academia and private sector and including university students were engaged to provide their input for creating the NSP.
He said Prime Minister Khan had directed the National Security Division (NSD) to give monthly update on implementation of the NSP and problems being faced in its implementation.
MPs tax directory
In another landmark decision, the information minister said, the cabinet had ordered publication of MPs 2019 tax directory, adding no other sector had as much accountability as politicians. “The foundation of a government is based on transparency,” he added.
Mr Chaudhry said on the recommendation of the Finance Ministry, the cabinet gave approval to the names of the members of new board of directors of the House Building Finance Corporation.
He said the cabinet also approved a bill that seeks enhanced coordination among various education boards.
He said the cabinet also approved the proposal for appointment of Mohammad Asim to the post of executive member of the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority.
The cabinet also gave approval to the constitution of a joint investigation team for an investigation into the killing of Nazim Jokhio who was killed in Karachi.
The minister said police investigation into his murder case had been compromised to save the killers of Mr Jokhio.
Mr Chaudhry said the cabinet approved the proposal to convert Citizen Club in F-9 Park, Islamabad, into Gandhara Heritage and Cultural Centre and the PM will head its management committee.
The cabinet, he said, approved the proposal to send to Cuba made-in-Pakistan Covid-related medical equipment worth Rs23 million. The consignment includes face masks, sanitizers and personal protective equipment.
He said the ministries had been given the powers to make temporary appointments on vacant posts for six months.
