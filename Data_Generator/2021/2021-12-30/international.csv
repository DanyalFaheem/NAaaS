0,Media outlet closes in Hong Kong after police raid,Suppression of the city’s local press has increased in the wake of 2019’s huge and often violent democracy protests.,"HONG KONG: Hong Kong pro-democracy media outlet Stand News said on Wednesday it will close after a police raid and arrests of seven current and former staff members, in the latest blow to the city’s rapidly shrinking press freedoms.
Suppression of the semi-autonomous Chinese city’s local press has increased in the wake of 2019’s huge and often violent democracy protests and Beijing’s subsequent imposition of a sweeping national security law.
On Wednesday morning, police officers burst into Stand News’ office, seizing phones, computers, documents and thousands of dollars, while hauling its acting editor-in-chief into the headquarters in handcuffs as it was searched.
“Because of the current situation, Stand News will stop operating immediately,” the outlet said later in a statement on Facebook.
Stand News said its website and social media would no longer be updated and would be taken down soon. It added that acting editor-in-chief Patrick Lam, who was among those arrested, had resigned and all employees were terminated.
Steve Li, senior superintendent of the national security police, accused the media outlet of publishing news articles and blog posts between July 2020 and November 2021 that incited hatred towards the Hong Kong government, among other alleged crimes.

1,China warns Taiwan of ‘drastic measures’ if it moves for independence,China regularly describes the island as the most sensitive issue in its ties with the United States.,"BEIJING: China will take “drastic measures” if Taiwan makes moves towards independence, a Beijing official warned on Wednesday, adding that Taiwan’s provocations and outside meddling could intensify next year.
China claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and in the past two years has stepped up military and diplomatic pressure to assert its sovereignty claim, fuelling anger in Taipei and concern in Washington.
China was willing to try its utmost to seek peaceful reunification with Taiwan but would act if any red lines on independence were crossed, Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman of the Taiwan Affairs Office, told a media briefing.
“If separatist forces in Taiwan seeking independence provoke, exert force or even break through any red line, we will have to take drastic measures,” Ma said.
Taiwan has emerged as a key factor in strained relations between China and the United States, the island’s most important international backer and arms supplier despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties.
China regularly describes the island as the most sensitive issue in its ties with the United States.
Ma said provocation by pro-independence forces and “external intervention” could grow “sharper and more intense” in coming months.
“Next year, the Taiwan Strait situation will become more complex and severe,” he said.
Beijing has sent repeated air missions over the Taiwan Strait in recent months to pressure Taiwan. It has said it will not give in to threats.
While the United States recognises only one China, it is required by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself and has long followed a policy of “strategic ambiguity” on whether it would intervene militarily to protect Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack.
The defeated Republic of China government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with the Communists, who established the People’s Republic of China.

2,Iraqi vote victor Sadr meets pro-Iran rivals,State media reported the leaders discussed “the political situation” and the “formation of the next government”.,"NAJAF: The winner of Iraq’s October parliamentary election, Shia cleric Moqtada Sadr, met on Wednesday with rivals from the pro-Iran Hashed al-Shaabi former paramilitary alliance ahead of the opening of parliament.
The October 10 vote was rejected by the Fatah (Conquest) Alliance, the political arm of the pro-Tehran Hashed, but Iraq’s top court on Monday dismissed their allegations of voter fraud and ratified the results.
It paves the way for parliament to meet and elect a president — who will then name a prime minister tasked with forming a new government.
In multi-confessional and multi-ethnic Iraq, the formation of governments has involved complex negotiations ever since the 2003 US-led invasion toppled dictator Saddam Hussein.
On Wednesday, leaders including Fatah Alliance chief Hadi al-Ameri, senior Hashed official Faleh al-Fayyad and Qais al-Khazali, head of the Asaib Ahl al-Haq force — a key component of the Hashed — were hosted by Sadr at his home in the Iraqi shrine city of Najaf, according to state news agency INA.
The leaders discussed “the political situation” and the “formation of the next government”, INA reported.
Sadr, a political maverick and former anti-US militia leader who opposes all foreign interference, had already met leaders from pro-Iran parties earlier this month.
Iraq is trying to recover from years of war and jihadist violence but remains hobbled by political divisions, corruption and poverty.

3,Cocaine worth $143m seized in Rotterdam,"THE HAGUE: Dutch customs have seized more than 1.6 tonnes of cocaine, hidden in shipments of bananas, cocoa beans ...","THE HAGUE: Dutch customs have seized more than 1.6 tonnes of cocaine, hidden in shipments of bananas, cocoa beans and cement in Rotterdam harbour, the public prosecutor’s office said on Wednesday.
The smuggled drugs, with an estimated street value of 127 million euros ($143 million) were stashed in three containers that arrived in Europe’s largest port.
“The first container came from Ecuador and were loaded with bananas destined for a company in Barendrecht,” just outside Rotterdam, prosecutors said.
“The drugs in the second container were found in a load of cocoa beans, also from Ecuador but which had been shipped through Colombia and then came via Antwerp,” the statement said. A third container, loaded with cement destined for Portugal, had five sports bags filled with drugs.
Drug seizures have rocketed this year in Rotterdam harbour — now seen as a major gateway into Europe for drugs, particularly cocaine.
Dutch customs authorities said they had confiscated a record 68 tonnes of cocaine in 2021, compared to 49 tonnes the previous year.
The EU’s policing agency has warned that the Netherlands and neighbouring Belgium are becoming major hubs for cocaine, especially for supplies coming from Colombia.
The North Sea coast has now “overtaken the Iberian peninsula as the primary point of entry for cocaine reaching Europe,” Europol said in a report, released in September.
After cannabis, cocaine is the second-most popular drug in Western and Central Europe, with an estimated 4.4 million users over the past year, the Europol report said.

4,US appoints two envoys for Afghan women,"“Two highly qualified and respected leaders will advance the State Department’s vital work,"" says US state secretary.","

WASHINGTON: The United States on Wednesday appointed two special envoys for defending women’s rights in Afghanistan’s as the country’s new Taliban rulers further tightened gender restrictions.
Rina Amiri, an Afghan-born US scholar and mediation expert who served at the State Department under former president Barack Obama, will take the role of special envoy for Afghan women, girls and human rights.
Stephenie Foster, also a former State Department official with diverse public and private sector experiences, will be the new Senior Adviser for Women and Girls Issues in the office of the Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts (CARE).
“Two highly qualified and respected leaders will advance the State Department’s vital work to support Afghan women, girls, and human rights,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement issued by his office.
Mr Blinken said that Ms Amiri will address issues of “critical importance to me” and the rest of President Joe Biden’s administration. “We desire a peaceful, stable and secure Afghanistan, where all Afghans can live and thrive in political, economic and social inclusivity,” he added.
Earlier this week, the Taliban imposed new restrictions, banning women from working and limiting their access to education. The moves go against the pledges Taliban made after their Aug 15 takeover when they promised a moderate policy on such issues.
The new rules prevent women from traveling long distances without a male escort and forbid vehicle owners from giving rides to women unless they wear headscarves.
On Monday, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry also expressed his concern on this new development. “Saying that women can’t travel alone or go to schools and colleges — this kind of retrogressive thinking is a danger for Pakistan,” he said at a public meeting in Islamabad.
Secretary Blinken said Ms Amiri “will work closely with me” on issues like “fundamental freedoms of women, girls, and other at-risk populations in all of their diversity.”
Special Envoy Amiri’s important work will be complemented by the contributions of Stephenie Foster, he added.

5,Nine Serbs indicted for killing around 100 Muslims,Bosnia’s state court will need to confirm the indictment for the case to proceed.,"SARAJEVO: A Bosnian war crimes prosecutor has indicted nine Bosnian Serbs for the killing of around 100 Muslim Bosniaks, including seven entire families, early in the 1992-95 war, the prosecutor’s office said in a statement on Wednesday.
Twenty-six years after the end of its devastating war between Orthodox Serbs, Catholic Croats and Muslim Bosniaks in which about 100,000 people had died, Bosnia is still searching for people who went missing and seeking justice against the suspected perpetrators.
At the same time, the Balkan country is going through its worst post-war political crisis, with Bosnian Serb leaders’ threat of pulling out of Bosnia’s national institutions, including the joint armed forces, raising fears of a new conflict.
The nine men, the former members and commanders of the Bosnian Serb wartime army, are accused of killing the Bosniak civilians from the area around the southeastern Bosnian town of Nevesinje, including dozens of women, elderly people and small children.
The prosecutor’s office said seven families were among those killed in the summer of 1992. The remains of 49 people have been found while 47 people are still unaccounted for.
Bosnia’s state court will need to confirm the indictment for the case to proceed.

6,Israel agrees to transfer tax receipts to Palestinians after Abbas’s visit,Israel collects hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes on behalf of the PA as part of the 1990s interim peace agreements.,"JERUSALEM: Israel’s defence minister approved a raft of measures aimed at improving relations with the Palestinians on Wednesday following a rare meeting with Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas in Israel.
Defence Minister Benny Gantz met Abbas at his private residence in a Tel Aviv suburb late on Tuesday night. It was the first time Abbas met an Israeli official inside Israel since 2010.
The two discussed security coordination between Israel and Abbas’ Palestinian Authority, which administers pockets of the occupied West Bank.
Gantz’s office said he approved confidence-building measures (CBM) including the transfer of tax payments to the Palestinian Authority, the authorisation of hundreds of permits for Palestinian merchants and VIPs, and approving residency status for thousands of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Israel collects hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes on behalf of the PA as part of the interim peace agreements signed in the 1990s.
The tax transfers are a key source of funding for the cash-strapped Palestinians, but Israel has withheld funds over the PA’s payment of stipends to thousands of families that have had relatives killed, wounded or imprisoned in the conflict.
Israel claims the payments incentivise terrorism, while the Palestinians say they provide crucial support to needy families.
Israel approved residency for some 9,500 Palestinians.
Israel controls the Palestinian population registry, and over the years its policies have left an estimated tens of thousands of Palestinians without legal status, severely limiting their freedom of movement, even within the occupied territories.
Israel granted legal status to some 4,000 Palestinians in October.
Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett is opposed to Palestinian statehood. His government has shown no interest in reviving peace talks, which broke down more than a decade ago, but has said it wants to reduce tensions by improving living conditions in the West Bank.
