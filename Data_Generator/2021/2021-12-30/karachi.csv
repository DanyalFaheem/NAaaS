0,Report finds social media among reasons behind rising suicide trend in Tharparkar,Recommends establishment of Early Warning Help Line Service.,"HYDERABAD: A fact-finding report on increasing trend of suicide in Tharparkar has attributed the depressing trend, among other reasons, to negative impact of social media, which makes people believe “if there seems no solution to problems the best way is to commit suicide rather than facing the situation.”
The report compiled by a seven member committee appointed by DIG Mirpurkhas range Zulfiqar Mahar recommended establishment of psychosocial and rehabilitation centre in the district to register people suffering from psychological problems like depression, hopelessness etc. 
It said that if family members, relatives or neighbours noticed telltale signs in an individual they should immediately inform the centre and seek support for him or her.
The report discussed issues of social transformation, sexual exploitation, forced marriages, wani, child marriages, religious and traditional barriers, drug addiction, leisure time with no incentives, population explosion, income and loan repayment procedure, exposure to social media, role of police in examination, MLO’s responsibility and psycho-social counselling services.
It said that rural people had an impression about the city life that it was carefree and free of problems and they too should adopt it but their socio-economic conditions did not support such change, causing increased depressive disorder. Sexual exploitation was also one of the reasons for suicide, it said. 
It said that forced or wani marriages and child marriages were common, particularly among Bheel and Kolhi communities who believed that a girl should be married at an early age to take up responsibility of children. Bhopa, Darvesh and Faqir wielded great influence over people in rural areas and youth and elders (male) consumed drugs as an escape from problems, it said.
It proposed police should investigate suicide cases and review 174 CrPC to either register it as FIR or not. A committee of stakeholders be constituted by senior police officer for proper examination of socio-economic reasons behind suicide and budget be allocated for police stations for chemical analysis of suicide victims, it said.
The committee comprised members of civil society rights defender Kashif Bajir (chairman), Partab Shivani and Gotam Rathi (minorities) Dr Lakesh Khatri (psychiatrist), Ms Hajani Lanjho (District Bar Association), DSP Ayoub Dars and inspector Ms Fozia Nasir (members).
It said that a mortuary be established in the district to keep bodies for longer periods to help investigation, and a chemical analysis laboratory be set up to increase access to investigation because collected samples were sent to Karachi for examination which ultimately took time.
“Psychosocial and Rehabilitation Centre shall be established to register people facing psychological problems such as depression, hopelessness and disinterest in life,” it said. 
A Medico Legal Officer should be a trained doctor with specialisation in post mortem and be posted in district headquarters and taluka hospitals for proper medical examination of suicide victims, it said. 
It said the psychiatrists be posted in hospitals and police department to counter incidents of depressive illness and provide psychosocial support to communities.
The report recommended that an Early Warning Help Line Service be established to allow people to register cases and inform about psychosocial problems faced by an individual or family. Open katchehry be held at every police station with the help of NGOs to provide a platform to communities to discuss and share problems, it said.
It said that deputy commissioner should invite investors and stakeholders to launch industrial initiatives to support people in income generation opportunities as engagement of youth was becoming the most serious challenge for society.
It proposed that Tharparkar district be promoted for tourism which could help generate revenue. Lady health supervisors and health workers along with population department should ensure birth spacing as an average household in Thar had 8-11 children amid scarce resources. 
The culture department should organise theatres in union councils to sensitise communities to ethical practices and moral standards, it said.

1,"Sindh’s share in urea being given to Punjab, says Wassan",KARACHI: Adviser to Sindh chief minister on agriculture Manzoor Hussain Wassan on Wednesday alleged that the federal...,"KARACHI: Adviser to Sindh chief minister on agriculture Manzoor Hussain Wassan on Wednesday alleged that the federal government was giving Sindh’s share of urea to other provinces by exerting pressure on fertiliser companies. 
Addressing a press conference here, he said Federal Minister Hammad Azhar had slashed the Sindh’s quota of urea fertiliser to provide more to Punjab. 
The agriculture adviser said the province received less than 1.5 million bags of urea fertiliser in December. “On the directive of Federal Minister Hamad Azhar, Punjab has been given more quota,” he said, alleging that the federal minister was instrumental to ‘smuggling’ of urea from Sindh to other provinces. 
He said the federal government wanted to create a shortage of fertiliser in Sindh. “Injustice is being committed with Sindh,” he said, asking Prime Minister Imran Khan to have mercy on the province. 
Manzoor Wassan said that most of the natural gas was produced in Sindh which was not being given its due share as guaranteed in the constitution. “The federation is creating artificial shortages,” he added. 
He said the provincial government wanted the immediate resolution of the fertiliser crisis in the province. “We have also formed a committee, ensuring that the ghost dealers should not get urea as the fertiliser companies are giving their product to dealers wrongfully,” he said. 
The agriculture adviser said the provincial government would not allow anyone to take fertiliser from Sindh to any other province. “We have set up check posts at the provincial borders to check the illegal movement of fertiliser,” he said, adding that the federal government and fertiliser companies were responsible for the urea crisis in Sindh as “Imran Khan wants to destabilise Sindh”. 
Mr Wassan also predicted that Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari would get married after becoming prime minister either in 2022 or 2023. “Politically, year 2022 will be dangerous, there will be many rallies and big change is likely”, he said. 
He also predicted former prime minister Nawaz Sharif would not return home before March 2022. “Fazlur Rehman got as much share in KPK as he was supposed to get, he will not get anything more, now it is our turn,” he said.

Comrade Sanjha Channa, Darya Khan, Rasheed Khoso and others, who led the protest, said that it appeared the government had decided to privatise public sector universities. Constant raise in fees would lead to eventual privatisation of universities, they feared.
They said that it was tantamount to closing doors of education on students of peasants and labourers and rejected the fee hike. They would support SAU students’ demand for cut in fees, they said.

3,No arrest yet as slow-paced Nasla Tower probe gets under way,Investigators pay a visit to head office of SBCA.,"KARACHI: No arrest has been made in connection with a criminal case registered against builder, owner and government officials regarding the illegal construction of 15-storey Nasla Tower as the pace of investigation appears to be slow, it emerged on Wednesday. 
While raids had been conducted and ‘visits’ to the office of the Sindh Building Control Authority made by investigating agencies — police and Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) — what came as a strange course of investigation was its slow and leisurely pace to find out the real culprits and then seeking assistance to identify the suspects from the same institution which is under the radar for all the illegalities carried out in raising the building. 
A police investigation team led by SP Altaf Hussain along with officials of the ACE visited the SBCA office in Civic Centre, met its senior officers and sought a list of those who were part of the authority when the layout plan of Nasla Tower was approved. 

Investigators pay a visit to head office of SBCA

“We have sought a list from the SBCA and names of those officials who were here at time the [Nasla Towr] building was approved,” SP Hussain said while talking to reporters after the visit. 
“The police teams are also carrying out raids on the homes of the SBCA officers concerned. The SBCA officials today provided us some details and documents and we are closely analysing all these things. We have also sought record from the Sindhi Muslim Cooperative Housing Society. Things would start gathering pace soon,” he said. 
The Ferozabad police on Tuesday lodged an FIR against the owner of the plot where the Nasla Tower was raised, a builder and all those officials of different government agencies and private organisations who helped and facilitated the illegal construction of the multi-storey residential building off main Sharea Faisal. 
The police investigation came following the orders from the Supreme Court regarding registration of an FIR against SBCA officials. It had also directed the Karachi commissioner to complete the demolition of the 15-storey building within a week and asked the official assignee to attach the land in order to compensate the affected residents as the builders did not come forward to refund the residents money. 
However, as told by the police authorities, it seems that the process would take some time to identify, trace and then arrest the people behind the illegal construction of the building. 
A late-night raid, police sources told Dawn, on the house of a former assistant director of the SBCA had failed to achieve any success. 
“Safdar Magsi was the assistant director of the SBCA when the construction of the Nasla Tower was approved,” said a source while denying the impression of a laid-back approach of the law enforcement agency. 
“His home was raided, but he was not there. There are some 25 to 30 SBCA officials who are suspected for their role in facilitating and helping the illegal activity and deliberating ignoring violation of defined rules for vested interests,” he said. “Although the police have sought the SBCA’s help in gathering data and names, they are also doing their job on their own without relying on any individual or institution.”

4,"KMC ready to take control of Askari Park, says Murtaza Wahab",The Supreme Court has given Corps V two weeks to hand over Askari Park to the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation.,"KARACHI: City Admin­is­t­ra­­­tor Barrister Murtaza Wahab on Wednesday said that the decision of the Supreme Court regarding Askari Park would be implemented.
The apex court had given Corps V two weeks to hand over Askari Park in Gulshan-i-Iqbal to the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation.
A two-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Gulzar Ahmed had directed the KMC to remove all commercial activities and structures on the premises of the park and ensure that it would be fully kept for public.
Speaking at the inauguration ceremony of a model park in Shah Faisal Colony, the administrator said that KMC was ready to take administrative control of the park for its renovation and beautification as directed by the Supreme Court.
He said that the he had inaugurated a park in Model Colony the other day and now another park was opened here.
“We do not have an elected representative in Korangi, yet we are serving indiscriminately because we believe in service, and will continue to serve the people,” he said.
He announced that the Second Marigold Festival would be held at Frere Hall from Jan 7 to 9.
Sindh govt buying 240 buses
He said that the provincial government would buy 240 buses shortly to resolve public transport issue of the metropolis. He said that 50 buses would arrive by Jan 31.
He added that a special waterline was being laid from Hub to facilitate the residents of district West.
He said that Sindh produced the most gas, yet its people were deprived of the basic necessity. “It is their [federal government] incompetence that they say there will be a gas shortage in winter,” he said.
He said that due to shortage of gas, a delegation of industrialists called on the chief minister in which they said that they could not fulfil their export orders.
“Today not only Karachi, but also Lahore, Islamabad, Peshawar, Quetta, Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir are caught in the whirlpool of inflation,” he said, adding that the inflation had risen to 12.5 per cent within a year.

5,MPC demands review of controversial Sindh LG law,Resolution emphasises need to root out “mafias” from the city rather than holding random operations against encroachments.,"KARACHI: A multiparty conference (MPC) organised by Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) on Wednesday demanded that the Pakistan Peoples Party government review the Sindh Local Government (Amendment) Act 2021 to empower the third tier of the government at grassroots level.
The MPC — Construct Karachi, Construct Pakistan — held at the Karachi Press Club was presided over by MWM leader Syed Ali Hussain Naqvi. 
The conference was attended by leaders of different parties including Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf MPA Bilal Ghaffar, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan leaders Muhammad Abbas and Mehfoz Yar Khan, Syed Hafeezuddin of the Pak Sarzameen Party, Younus Bunari of Awami National Party, Sardar Rahim of Pakistan Muslim League-Functional, Tariq Hassan of PML-Q, Rao Kamran Iqbal of Pakistan Awami Tehreek, Atiq Meer of All Karachi Tajir Ittehad and several members of the civil society.
The participants at the conference vowed to struggle together for the prosperity of Karachi and demanded that the provincial government review the controversial law amid serious reservations of the political and business stakeholders of the city.
They said that Karachi was currently deprived of necessities like water, gas, electricity and infrastructure. However, they were of the view that the division of Sindh on ethnic grounds could jeopardise harmony and peace. 
The government can facilitate the citizen even in limited resources through different relief schemes, they added. 
A resolution adopted by the participants of the conference emphasised the need to root out “mafias” from the city rather than holding random operations against encroachments. 
It also asked the federal government for making efforts so that the prime minister’s relief package could benefit the people of the city.
The conference demanded early completion of the K-IV water supply project to address water scarcity in the city and sought immediate intervention both from the federal and provincial governments to resolve basic problems regarding the necessities of the city.

6,Delimitation of local govt constituencies in Sindh to begin tomorrow,ECP likely to complete task in three months.,"KARACHI: While the main opposition parties in Sindh are teaming up with each other against amendments made by the Pakistan Peoples Party government to the local government law, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) is set to start the delimitation process from Friday (tomorrow) for LG elections in Sindh.
The process is likely to complete in March next year as the ECP said that the final list of union councils and union committees/wards would be published by delimitation committees on March 24. 
According to the schedule issued by the ECP to carry out delimitation, the completion of all administrative arrangements including procurement of maps and relevant data would be made within 15 days (from Dec 31 to Jan 14, 2022), the preliminary list of union council and union committees/ward would be prepared by delimitation committees from Jan 17 to Feb 15 and the same would be published on Feb 16 inviting representations and objections. 

ECP likely to complete task in three months

The objections and representations could be filed by voters concerned between Feb 17 and March 4 before such committees and the same would be disposed of till March 21.
March 22 would be the last date to communicate the decisions of delimitation authorities to delimitation committees while the final list would be published on March 24, it added. 
The tenure of the last local governments in Sindh had ended in Aug 30, 2020 and the ECP was under constitutional and legal obligation to hold the LG polls within 120 days of the expiry of the tenure. 
However, it could not be complied with as initially letters issued by the provincial election commission in April last year to district election commissioners of Sindh for delimitation of UCs/ wards were challenged in court on the grounds that under the Elections Act, 2017, the exercise of delimitation could not be carried out unless the final results of the population census were officially published. 
After several directives of the court, the Council of Common Interests had approved Census-2017 in April and the official result of census was published in May. 
Thereafter, the Sindh government has been continuing to drag its feet on the issue as the ECP had notified delimitation committees for LG polls in Sindh, but the provincial government did not provide requisite data nor made amendment to the Sindh LG Act 2013 on the pretext that it had reservations on the official result of the 2017 census. 
In November, the ECP had issued a final deadline to the Sindh government to provide data for holding elections in the province. 
The ECP had directed the chief secretary to give necessary legislation and the requisite data, maps and notifications within two weeks and warned that alternatively, the commission would initiate the delimitation process in the province with effect from Dec 1 under the applicable LG law (LG Act 2013) in Sindh and would frame rules thereunder. 
Thus, the Sindh Local Government (Amendment) Bill, 2021, was first passed in November in the provincial assembly and again this month after the same was sent back by the governor after raising several objections. 
However, all the major opposition parties of Sindh have been protesting against the amendments and some of them have also petitioned the Sindh High Court. According to them, the bill has usurped the authority of local governments. 
They have strongly opposed the amendment made to Section 140-A (Power of government to amend schedules) which says, “Notwithstanding anything contained in this act, the government shall have power to amend, alter, add or remove any entries from the schedules, by notification and the official gazette”.

7,High tsunami risk poses dual challenge to Pakistan: experts,"Country experienced 4,039 earthquakes from 2008  to 2014.","KARACHI: Pakistan faces potentially high tsunami risk with dual challenge; the natural disaster has high probability and, second, allows little response time as the triple junction known as the Makran subduction zone is located just 50 kilometres away from Balochistan’s coast, warned experts at a workshop on Wednesday.
The event — Media awareness on early warning system for hydrometeorological hazards (tsunami, cyclones and heavy rains) — was jointly organised by the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) in collaboration with United Nations Development Programme.
“We would just have 15 to 20 minutes to analyse the situation and respond. While Gwadar has elevated front (and a bit safe), its areas of East and West Bay are very vulnerable in case a tsunami occurs of the same (8.7 magnitude) intensity that struck in 1945. It will also inundate Gwadar port and the city,” said Tariq Ibrahim of the Met department, citing data generated with the help of simulation studies.

Country experienced 4,039 earthquakes from 2008  to 2014

About its impact on Karachi, he said one to two kilometre area of the city’s coast was very vulnerable (to damage). “The many tributaries of the Indus delta makes Sindh’s coast very vulnerable (to tsunami threat).”
The Makran subduction zone, he pointed out, had potential to generate future tsunamis in the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean. More than 4,000 people were killed along Pakistan’s coast and neighbouring countries like Iran, India and Oman by tsunami in 1945.
“Pakistan is situated in a tectonically very active zone, lying at the triple plate junction of Indian, Eurasian and Arabian plate boundaries, where the Indian plate pushes into the Eurasian plate,” he said.
Both the Karakoram and Hindu Kush ranges, he said, were caused by the collision of the Indian plate into the Eurasian plate and that the Hindu Kush and the Pamir constituted one of the most seismically active earthquake zones in the world.
“We had 4,039 earthquakes in Pakistan in six years (2008-2014). But, most of them were of light and minor intensity (ranging between one and 4.9 magnitude),” he said.
Threat of intense cyclones
The experts at the workshop also explained in detail the threat Pakistan faced from cyclones and said there was a likelihood of intense cyclones in the future as sea temperature was rising. The changing climate might not affect their frequency of occurrence.
“In other oceans, however, the frequency of cyclones is predicted to increase with rise in sea level,” said chief meteorologist Dr Sardar Sarfaraz while giving a presentation on weather forecast and formation of cyclones.
Countries, he said, had learnt to minimise human and material losses from cyclones. In this respect, he gave the example of Bangladesh that had built elevated shelters in the coastal areas for immediate evacuation in case of a cyclone threat. Over 300,000 people died in the 1970 cyclone that hit East Pakistan.
“The socio-economic benefits of weather prediction are estimated to amount to at least $160 billion per year. For every dollar invested, at least $26 in socio-economic return could be realised,” he said, referring to a study conducted by the World Meteorological Organization.
During the discussion, it was highlighted that the Met department had modern art seismic monitoring and tsunami early warning centre at the PMD Complex in Karachi and Islamabad.

KARACHI: Bringing into focus, the lifelong struggles of lawyer and human rights activist Rashid Rehman, the book Eshq Wo Kar-e Musal Sal Hai by columnist and academician Prof Dr Tauseef Ahmed Khan was launched at the office of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) here on Wednesday.  
Introducing the book, HRCP vice chairperson Qazi Khizar said it tells you the story of the lawyer and human rights activist Rashid Rehman from his birth to his death. 
“He was a lawyer and head of HRCP in Multan who had dedicated his life to helping the poor and those being wronged. He fought for their rights. And that’s what he was doing defending Junaid Hafeez, a university lecturer being tried on blasphemy charges,” he said, adding that Rehman was Hafeez’s second lawyer as his first counsel turned down the case and didn’t even return the fee.  
“For taking the case he was receiving open death threats. All his friends tried to convince him to stop defending Junaid Hafeez, the lecturer. But he was adamant,” he said.
Assistant Professor Dr Irfan Aziz observed that a few thousand new books are being published here annually though most of them are propaganda books or digests while books on serious subjects are scarce. “We need books about our society, our people. We need realistic books,” he said. 
Regional Director of Aurat Foundation Mahnaz Rehman said that the seemingly small book is a well-researched treatise. She also said that people used to be afraid to speak up about Junaid Hafeez. But now many are talking about the misuse of the blasphemy law. “This month we also saw the horrific Priyantha Kumara lynching incident, which has brought the issue back into focus,” she said.  
Dr Riaz Ahmed Shaikh said it is a book of just nine chapters but it is a notable book. 
“It is an open FIR against the state of Pakistan, which cannot save people who stand up to defend those who are being wronged here. It is the state that should save people from exploitation but instead, it was Rashid Rehman who did all this. He helped people trapped in bonded labour, he helped in land reforms for the poor peasants, he defended women’s rights, he also went to jail and that, too, when he just had heart surgery,” he said.  
Senior journalist Ghazi Salahuddin said that the book was very much needed. “Our human rights defenders should know of their role models and Rashid Rehman was a role model,” he said.  
He also added that during the Priyantha Kumara incident one man was trying to stop the mob, who was later called and honoured at the Prime Minister House. “But Rashid Rehman was also like that. Why has he not been honoured?” 
Activist and journalist Zohra Yusuf sent in a message that was read out on the occasion. She writes that she still has emails from Rashid Rehman about the threats he was receiving. “He was even threatened before a judge but no action was taken. He was an exceptionally committed human rights fighter and I thank Dr Tauseef to put his story into the record and in print,” she wrote.  
Finally, the author of the book Dr Tauseef spoke. He said that the book could have been published long ago and in Rashid Rehman’s life but the manuscript was with the slain lawyer for years to review ahead of its publication. “And finally when he did go through it, he was gunned down soon after on May 7, 2014,” he said.  
“Meanwhile, Junaid Hafeez has been in jail for 10 years. There has been no progress on his appeal, too. He was a fine young teacher who is locked up due to a law that can be misused. There are several other laws like the blasphemy law introduced in the Ziaul Haq’s regime, which go against human rights and which need to be revisited and talked about to spread awareness about their downside,” he concluded.  
Senior journalist Sohail Sangi, labour leader Usman Baloch and HRCP’s co-chairman Asad Iqbal Butt also spoke.

9,‘Nationalism demands exclusive allegiance to state’,Prof Ashis Nandy delivers online lecture organised by Habib University,"KARACHI: Habib University hosted a lecture on “Clash of visions in the Third World: are we all dreaming of gatecrashing the colonisers’ world?” online as part of its Yohsin lecture series.
The online lecture by the post-colonial thinker Prof Dr Ashis Nandy was viewed by intellectuals, educationalists, socialists and journalists from all over around the world and turned out to be a national twitter trend.
Dr Nandy spoke about the intellectual failures in regards to post-colonialism, particularly how it appears as a racialized project that we have blindly internalised. 
He argued that people’s views were adopted and shaped by Western intellectual canons, which robbed them off their autonomy. This is even the case with post-colonial studies, he added.

Prof Ashis Nandy delivers online lecture organised by Habib University 

He identified a number of distinctive features of modern colonialism, especially the colonialism that came after the Spanish empire, which was solely interested in looting, and was not racial in character. With the British and French empires, the conquest of indigenous peoples was justified in the name of a selfless moral duty, also famously referred to as the White Man’s Burden. The Enlightenment, he argued, was racist and closely linked to the so-called “civilizing mission”.
The coexistence of different sacred cosmologies with science was possible in our part of the world, but not in the Western hemisphere, which was totalitarian, he remarked.
Dr Nandy lamented the fact that modern colonialism had not been examined seriously by post-colonial scholars. 
He spoke in-depth about the distinctiveness of the modern nation-state. “The nation-state is not given to us by birth. Nationalism is an ideology, which demands an exclusive allegiance to your state. Nationalism demands that you adopt your state’s enemies as your own enemies,” he pointed out.
He concluded his lecture by warning the audience of the social ills of accepting the nation-state at the cost of culture, language, ethnicity and identity. 
Alluding to recent state-transformative efforts in our region, he said: “Configuring a different kind of state will portend a dark future for countries in South Asia if we are not careful.”
The Yohsin lecture series is Habib University’s flagship event which brings global scholars to Pakistan.

11,Around 0.5m diabetics may face amputations in 2022: experts,KARACHI: Over half million diabetics in Pakistan could lose their legs amid growing cases of amputation among its...,"KARACHI: Over half million diabetics in Pakistan could lose their legs amid growing cases of amputation among its patients due to ulcers and other complications, experts warned on Wednesday calling for immediate intervention from the health authorities for better treatment facilities and extra care of the patients. 
They believe that with 33 million people living with diabetes now in Pakistan, diabetic amputations are on the rise and if appropriate measures are not taken immediately 300,000 to 600,000 people may lose their legs because of diabetic foot ulcers in 2022 in Pakistan. 
“Amputation rate among people living with diabetes is between 20 to 40 per cent in our part of the world,” said Diabetic Foot International president Dr Zahid Miyan while speaking at a ceremony regarding the establishment of 30 diabetic-foot clinics throughout Karachi. 
The facilities are aimed at providing an evidence-based standard of diabetic-foot care to people living with diabetes within or close to their houses and the application of a fast-track tool for early recognition, management and a referral system. 
On the occasion, a memorandum of understanding was signed between the Baqai Institute of Diabetology and Endocrinology (BIDE) and local pharmaceutical firm High-Q Pharma for the establishment of 30 diabetic-foot clinics in Karachi. General practitioners and family physicians would be trained there in the identification of diabetic-foot ulcers, their treatment and referral to a tertiary-care facility in case the wound requires surgery or vascular treatment. 
BIDE Director and renowned diabetologist Prof Dr Abdul Basit said Pakistan could save billions of rupees by providing standardised diabetic-foot care in the country.

Palijo said at a press conference after offering condolence to Syed Hidayatullah Shah on the death of her daughter Syed Nosheen Shah here on Wednesday that the ruling party should rectify the flaws in the LG law with the help of stakeholders.
He said that councillors should be residents of Karachi who should be elected in a democratic manner and empowered as well so they could work for their areas. He was not in favour of doling out powers on political grounds to councillors, nazims and chairmen as he believed the local bodies should not be manipulated politically, he said.
He appealed to all people engaged in politics in Karachi to think of entire Sindh and not only of Karachi when they practiced politics and avoid raising slogans that might resurrect linguistic prejudices.
He said that everyone talked about “occupation” of Karachi and “occupation” of this and that city or area, while in Punjab no one raised such slogans.
About mysterious death of Syed Nosheen Shah, final year student of MBBS in Chandka Medical College Larkana, Palijo said that her death bespoke the alarming conditions prevailing in Sindh’s educational institutions. 
He said that Nosheen was murdered in the PPP’s political capital but no party leader bothered to visit her home to offer condolence to the bereaved family. All the evidence showed that she had not committed suicide, he said.
