• FM assures economic sovereignty will be guarded
ISLAMABAD: The opposition on Wednesday harshly slammed the government on the floor of the National Assembly over its plan to present a mini-budget and a bill granting autonomy to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to meet certain conditions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and vowed to block it “with full force”, terming it a step towards “surrendering the country’s financial sovereignty”.
Speaking on points of order while interrupting the Question Hour, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) MNA Raja Pervez Ashraf and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML) parliamentary leader Khawaja Asif even asked the treasury members not to support the government bills which, according to them, would make the lives of the people of the country more difficult.
Mr Ashraf said the government needed to remove confusion and clarify the situation as there were “whispers” inside and outside the parliament that it was planning to bring a mini-budget in the assembly.
Mr Asif feared that the country’s nuclear programme was also in danger and it could be the next target.
“This is a request to the treasury members, please not to surrender the country’s economic sovereignty,” Mr Asif said, warning that “after this, Pakistan will be stripped of its nuclear capability”.
“Through this money bill and the SBP bill, we are going to surrender our financial sovereignty which will be worse than what happened on Dec 16, 1971,” Mr Asif said in his usual aggressive style amid slogans of “shame, shame” from the opposition benches.
The PML-N stalwart said the SBP had already been converted into a “local branch of the IMF” and the country had already received a “viceroy” in the form of the SBP governor.
“We have become a financial colony of the international donor institutions. For God’s sake, become a shield for the people of this country against price hike, vandalism and terrorism. Please have some realisation,” Mr Asif said while pointing towards the treasury benches.
He said the government did not have the required numbers in the house which was evident from the fact that it had not been able to complete quorum of the assembly for the past three days. He, however, without elaborating said they knew that the government could manage votes through “facilitators.”
The PML-N lawmaker vowed to oppose the two bills with full force and asked the government to try to create a national consensus as to how the country could be brought out of this difficult situation.
Earlier, Mr Ashraf said everyone in the house as well as people from different walks of life were concerned over reports that the government was planning to introduce a money bill or a mini-budget.
“Inflation, unemployment and shortage of gas and other commodities have already wreaked havoc on the people of the country. Now, if a mini-budget or money bill is in the offing, which would increase their difficulties, then everyone sitting in the house should resist the move,” he said.
Responding to the speeches of the two opposition members, Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi assured the house that the government would not and could not make any compromise on the country’s nuclear programme and that the country’s economic sovereignty would be protected. He, however, did not make any specific comment on the mini-budget and the SBP bill and once again blamed the previous governments for the present state of national economy.
When Deputy Speaker Qasim Suri gave floor to the foreign minister, the opposition members pointed out lack of quorum and staged a walkout in an effort to prevent him from responding to the speeches made by the two senior opposition members.
Mr Suri, however, declared the house in order after a headcount and allowed Mr Qureshi to continue his speech. As soon as Mr Qureshi resumed his speech, the opposition members returned to the house to participate in the proceedings.
Stating that protection of the country’s economic sovereignty was collective responsibility of the government and the parliament, Mr Qureshi said the country’s macro-economic indicators had not become alarming during the last three years. He said the overall economy had not deteriorated in the last three years but this was a long story that needed to be reviewed.
Commenting on the point raised by Mr Asif about the country’s nuclear assets, the minister said: “I want to say this on the floor of the house that there is, was and will remain a national consensus on credible minimum deterrence.”
Taking the opposition to task for using the quorum as a tool to register its protest and for disrupting the proceedings, he said it was true that it was mainly the government’s responsibility to maintain the quorum, but at the same time it was also responsibility of the opposition if it wanted to see the National Assembly functioning smoothly.
Joint opposition meeting
The joint opposition during a meeting on Wednesday pledged to block the mini-budget and the SBP bill in the assembly.
According to PML-N information secretary Marriyum Aurangzeb, the members of the opposition discussed the strategy to prevent the mini-budget and other “IMF-dictated legislations” from being passed in the house.
The opposition members pledged to use all their powers and resources to ensure that the legislations would not get approved. They hoped that the “upright” government allies would also take a decision against these steps of Prime Minister Imran Khan and would vote for the country’s national interests.
Those who attended the meeting included former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and Khawaja Asif of the PML-N, Naveed Qamar of the PPP and parliamentary leader of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Asad Mehmood.
It was decided that the opposition members would be asked to ensure their attendance on the day of presentation of the controversial bills in the assembly.

• Announces civil awards for ‘resilient exporters’ who help increase exports 
ISLAMABAD: Following the unexpected defeat of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) in the recently held first phase of local government elections in its stronghold of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and differences among the party candidates, Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday directed the province’s chief minister to ensure unity among party ranks for winning the second phase of polls next month.
Moreover, owing to the severe shortage of natural gas in the country, the prime minister directed the authorities concerned to ensure expeditious issuance of licences for domestic exploration of gas to meet the increasing demand, especially in winter.
He vowed to celebrate the diamond jubilee of the country in a befitting manner.
KP Chief Minister Mahmood Khan called on the prime minister to discuss the upcoming second phase of the local government elections and the PTI’s organisational structure in the province.
According to the Prime Minis­ter Office, Imran Khan directed the chief minister to take all steps to ensure unity and discipline within the party ranks for the next phase of the LG elections.
The KP chief minister apprised PM Khan of the progress on various development projects in the province at which the PM directed to complete all the projects on time so that people could get immediate relief and facilities.
Following the defeat in the first phase of the LG polls, the prime minister had wrapped up the PTI’s organisational structure and grilled the KP CM over the loss. He had called “wrong selection” of candidates as the main cause of the defeat and observed that in some constituencies three PTI candidates were contesting for one seat.
Differences among the PTI candidates were confirmed after some of them moved courts against each other. “It is because of their [party candidates’] differences that the prime minister directed the KP CM to ensure unity among party ranks before the second phase of the LG polls, which is scheduled for Jan 16, 2022,” sources told Dawn.
The sources said the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) declared the provisional results of 45 out of 63 tehsils in 17 districts of KP where local body elections were held on Dec 19.
According to the provisional results as well as unofficial and unverified results from 53 tehsils, the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) was leading with 20 seats. At the second spot was the PTI with 13 seats, independent candidates have won in 10 tehsils, while the Awami National Party (ANP) has so far won in six tehsils. The PML-N has claimed three seats, Jamaat-i-Islami two and the PPP and Tehreek-i-Islahat Pakistan one seat each.
The JUI-F also clinched the mayor’s seats in the provincial capital of Peshawar, Kohat and Bannu. In Mardan, the ANP’s nominees for mayor swept the polls.
Gas exploration: At a separate meeting on the demand and supply of natural gas, PM Khan instructed the relevant departments to remove hurdles in the process of installation of new liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and virtual pipeline projects by investors.
The meeting with federal ministers was briefed about the demand and supply from domestic reserves, and shortfall and import of LNG.
It was informed that the current constrained demand of gas in the country was 4,700 million cubic feet per day that increased to at least 6,000mmcfd in winters. The supply to domestic consumers amounted to 3,300mmcfd that was decreasing each year.
The prime minister directed that the gas shortfall be managed by importing LNG. With the current infrastructure, there was a shortfall of nearly 1,000mmcfd in winter for which multiple options were being adopted, he stated.
The meeting was also told that in the short term, the existing capacity of domestic terminals was being optimised and the process of issuance of virtual pipeline licences expedited. Additionally, the installation of two new LNG terminals was under way with all bottlenecks being removed on priority.
In this regard, the ministries of maritime affairs and petroleum as well as the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority were directed to coordinate and take all other stakeholders, including the investors, on board.
The PM emphasised the importance of the North-South Gas Pipeline and directed to ensure its execution without further delay in the agreed timelines.
Awards for exporters: In another meeting, PM Khan emphasised the need for promoting the export culture and said the traders helping increase the country’s exports would be rewarded with civil awards.
The PMO quoted Mr Khan as saying: “We need resilient exporters who will be rewarded with national civil awards as per their performance in increasing exports.”
He also directed the Ministry of Commerce to develop a portal that could cater to the complaints of exporters. The ministry was also directed to act as a catalyst to achieve sustained growth in exports. “We have to develop an ecosystem and a culture that can increase exports and decrease our dependence on imports,” he stressed.
Mr Khan also directed all the departments concerned to develop robust policies and transparency by using technology.
Earlier, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Commerce Abdul Razak Dawood apprised Mr Khan that this year, a record growth in exports had been achieved after 10 years of stagnation. He stressed that it was high time to introduce incentives to further increase the export target.
Pakistan’s diamond jubilee: PM Khan called for holding Pakistan’s diamond jubilee celebrations in a befitting manner to highlight the country’s distinctive identity, culture and unique location.
“On the occasion of the country’s 75th independence anniversary, there is a need to tell the youth about the purpose of Pakistan’s creation and the true message of Allama Iqbal,” Mr Khan said while presiding over a meeting held to review preparations for the diamond jubilee celebrations in the coming year. He was briefed in detail about the preparations by Minister for Information and Broadcasting Chaudhry Fawad Hussain.
The meeting was told that the celebrations will focus on highlighting the country’s history, culture, national heroes, the women who participated in the Pakistan Movement, local sports, tourism, economy, green Pakistan and relations with friendly countries through various events and documentaries.

2,"Every party seeks patronage of establishment, says minister",RAWALPINDI: Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed on Wednesday said every party and politician wanted to be...,"RAWALPINDI: Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed on Wednesday said every party and politician wanted to be patronised by the establishment, terming the debate on the return of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif useless.
“Every party wishes that the establishment patronises it, but at the same time, raises slogans of giving respect to vote… however, it is the decision of the establishment to support an elected government only,” Mr Ahmed said during his visit to the under-construction Mother and Child Hospital at Asghar Mall in Rawalpindi.
He was accompanied by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health Dr Faisal Sultan as well as senior health officials of Punjab.
Mr Ahmed said useless hype had been created about the return of Nawaz Sharif.
“It does not matter whether he comes or not; it will not make any difference to the government,” he said, adding it was strange that people who spent most of their lives in this country eventually left it instead of loving it.
“People went abroad for medical treatment instead of availing healthcare facility here,” he said.
The minister reiterated his offer of a one-way ticket to Pakistan for Nawaz Sharif.
Talking about the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), an alliance of opposition parties, the minister said he wanted the alliance to move the date of its protest from March 23 to the 30th as it coincided with Pakistan Day celebrations.
“For the first time, Pakistan Air Force will introduce J10 C fighter jets during the fly past in collaboration with China and these fighter airplanes are an answer to Rafale jets,” Mr Ahmed said.
“I requested them to change the date of the long march as many special guests will arrive in the country for the March 23 parade, therefore maintaining law and order is our priority,” he said, adding that no one would be allowed to take law into their hands, and if they do, law would take its course.
Mr Ahmed said they would take part in the next general elections under the leadership of Imran Khan.
“Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government, under PM Khan, will not only complete its tenure but also come into power again,” he added.
He said Rawalpindi’s Mother and Child Hospital worth Rs6 billion as well as the Leh Nullah and Ring Road projects would be completed before the present government’s term ended.
The minister said Prime Minister Khan would inaugurate the hospital on Feb 28, 2022 as 90 per cent work on the hospital was completed.
The hospital would be a state-of-the-art facility and would be included in the Prime Minister’s Health Card scheme for the residents of Punjab, he said, adding that the Provincial Central Development Working Party (CDWP) had approved the Leh Expressway project on which work would be started soon.
“The Executive Committee of National Economic Council (Ecnec) had also approved the project” and the residents on both sides of Leh Expressway would be allowed to construct plazas and commercial buildings, Mr Ahmed said.
The interior minister said he was working on getting two more blocks constructed in the CDA Hospital in Islamabad. “I face hurdles in carrying out development work in my constituency but not in Islamabad as there was no shortage of funds there,” he added.
Speaking on the occasion, Dr Faisal Sultan said the 400-bed hospital would be the first state-of-the-art facility of its kind in the country.
The hospital was being constructed on 200 kanals and a huge amount had been spent on it, he added.
Dr Sultan said health cards would be issued in Islamabad, Azad Kashmir Gilgit-Baltistan and in Punjab from Jan 1.
“Health cards would change the lives of citizens as they would be able to avail costly medical treatment from public and private-sector hospitals,” he added.

3,Pakistan Bar Council plans to resist junior judge Ayesha Malik’s rise to SC,"PBC's executive committee adopts resolution highlighting need to adhere to seniority principle, launching countrywide protests.","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s legal fraternity has started gearing up to put up effective resistance to what they believe another attempt to elevate a junior judge to the Supreme Court by superseding at least three competent, senior judges.
While the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) has called its meeting on Jan 5, 2022 to complete the unfinished agenda to elevate Justice Ayesha A. Malik of the Lahore High Court to the SC, the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) has called a meeting on Jan 3 to consider the matter and chalk out an appropriate strategy.
It may be recalled that on Sept 9, lack of consensus during an exte­nded meeting had forced the JCP to defer her elevation as the first-ever woman judge in Pakistan’s judicial history to enter the SC.
PBC Vice Chairman Khushdil Khan wrote letters to all the vice chairmen of executive committees, members of the JCP from the lawyers’ side, presidents of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) and the provincial and Islamabad Bar Councils and high court bar associations to attend the joint meeting scheduled to be held on Monday at PBC office.
The letter issued to different bar associations said the joint meeting was called to consider the elevation of the junior judge to the SC in what they called violation of the seniority principle. The letters recalled how Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Gulzar Ahmed again proposed the name of the junior judge from the LHC while superseding three senior judges including Chief Justice of the LHC Mohammad Ameer Bhatti.
The JCP was meeting on Jan 5 to consider the same name that had been earlier ‘disapproved’ by the JCP, the letter said. In this scenario, the joint meeting of lawyers was being called to chalk out a future course of action.
Balochistan High Court Bar Association President Majeed Kakar and PBC member from Balochistan Munir Kakar also dubbed the elevation of the junior judge as an attempt to trample the seniority principle. They emphasised that Justice Malik was being denied the right to become the chief justice of the LHC.
Instead of her, the most deserving judge who should be elevated to the Supreme Court was Islamabad High Court (IHC) Chief Justice Athar Minallah, they observed, adding that he should be nominated by the JCP to become the judge of the top court.
Meanwhile, a meeting of the executive committee of the PBC under the chairmanship of Mohammad Masood Chishti in its Wednesday meeting also adopted a resolution endorsing the statement of its vice chairman highlighting the need to adhere to the seniority principle and to launch countrywide protests.
The resolution also unanimously praised the illustrious career of former Justice Sarmad Jalal Usmani who became JCP member, stating that he remained an independent judge and refused to take oath under the Provisional Constitution Order and held his ground against the worst form of dictatorship and always stood for the rule of law and the Constitution while adhering to the principle of good conscience and justice.
After his appointment as JC member, the PBC and public at large expect the same level of steadfastness and perseverance for principle of seniority in appointment of judges to the superior judiciary, the resolution stated, adding that the council reiterated its consistent stance to stand for the principle of seniority.
Earlier on Sept 9, lack of consensus during an extended meeting had compelled the JCP to defer her elevation. As a consequence, PBC Vice Chairman Khushdil Khan had expressed his serious reservations and concerns regarding the move to, what he called an attempt to violate the seniority principle for elevation of judges to the Supreme Court and High Court. In a statement, the PBC vice chairman also emphasised that it was a consistent stance of the legal fraternity that judges should be elevated/appointed on the principle of seniority in all courts and that the ‘pick and choose’ practice must be stopped.
Four of the eight JCP members on Sept 9 namely Justice Maqbool Baqar, Justice Sardar Tariq Masood, former judge Dost Mohammad Khan and PBC representative Akhtar Hussain had opposed the idea, whereas the CJP, senior puisine judge Justice Umar Ata Bandial, Law Minister Barrister Farogh Naseem and Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Khalid Jawed Khan had favoured Justice Malik. Justice Qazi Faez Isa, another JCP member, however, was out of the country then.
When the JCP was meeting on Sept 9, the lawyers had also organised a protest and convention in a nearby SC Bar Association complex, in which they had accused the judiciary of favouritism due to its pick and choose practice in the appointments and thus harming the judiciary’s image.
In a resolution so adopted, the convention had asked the JCP to strictly adhere to the seniority principle in the judicial appointments to the apex court from the provincial high courts until such time as fair, transparent and objective criteria for appointment of judges at all levels were framed in consultation with all stakeholders including the Bar and the appropriate amendments to the Judicial Commission rules.

4,Security policy called into question in Senate,"• Opposition stages token walkout, noisy protest in front of chairman’s podium  • Says NSP framed without taking parliament on","• Opposition stages token walkout, noisy protest in front of chairman’s podium
• Says NSP framed without taking parliament on board
• Leader of house alleges opposition skipped national security meeting due to absence of ‘people in military uniform’
ISLAMABAD: The opposition in the Senate on Wednesday called into question the National Security Policy (NSP) framed without taking parliament on board, sparking a war of words and rumpus in the house.
The opposition also staged a token walkout from the house against the move, besides lodging a noisy protest in front of the chairman’s podium.
Raising the issue, PPP parliamentary leader in the Senate Sherry Rehman said reports suggested that the new policy, yet to be shared with parliament, would be based on economic centrality. She said despite being the primary arena for policy development, the NSP had been approved at a meeting of the National Security Committee without expected consultation from parliamentarians.
Ms Rehman said that instead of evolving consensus in parliament on the NSP and other issues of economic importance and civilian safety, the government continued to bulldoze bills and disregard democratic norms. “How can the country be secured if its economic and security policies are not audited by its public representatives?” she asked.
She said there had been no consultation with the opposition regarding the NSP, nor had its draft been presented to parliamentarians. “Our history is replete with failed policies which did not succeed because they were made behind closed doors.”
The PPP senator said there was a paper out there saying that economy would be central, but wondered what the new economic security policy was all about.
“Is Pakistan going to be secured with the mini-budget run directly from IMF or by the State Bank which is no longer going to be answerable to Pakistan? If economic security will flow from the IMF’s complete and crippling control of the economy, then this policy is highly questionable,” he said.
“How can the government speak about an NSP that focuses on economic development when the economic situation under the incumbent government has proven disastrous for the people? This government is responsible for unprecedented levels of rupee devaluation, a current account deficit of $7 billion in this financial year alone, inflation rate of 11.50 per cent and has racked up Rs50.5 trillion in debt and liabilities for Pakistan. People are unable to afford two square meals and those who can afford them do not have enough gas in their stoves to cook,” she added.
Ms Rehman said the reports suggested that the NSP would encompass anti-terror efforts to ensure civilian safety and economic development. “Securing Pakistan’s economy and population from violent extremism is the country’s main priorities. But what’s actually happening is far different as groups like TTP (Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan), who have declared jihad against the Pakistani state, are being offered amnesty. Additionally, the government has not made a draft of the NSP available to the public; how can a document focusing on safety and security not be provided to those it aims to protect?” she asked.
The PPP senator said the government claimed that this was a revolutionary and unprecedented policy; however, incorporating economic development within national security policies had been done time and time again during the tenures of previous governments.
“During the PPP government, we focused on regional trade from a framework of national security and implemented policies to uplift Pakistan’s economic standing both nationally and regionally. The PPP used to make national security policy in complete consultation with parliament and the opposition. It was always done by the prime minister; we are not about to get used to another system where no parliamentary leader takes responsibility for policy,” Ms Rehman said.
The house witnessed pandemonium after Leader of the House in the Senate Dr Shahzad Wasim chided the opposition for skipping the meeting of the Parliamentary Committee on National Security, saying the reason was simply the absence of “people in military uniform”.
He said the opposition’s claim that it had boycotted the meeting because the prime minister was not attending it made no sense as they did attend a briefing on national security which too was not attended by the prime minister.
The opposition members gathered close the chair’s dais, raising anti-government slogans. On the other hand, the treasury members in a counter move gathered close to the seat of Shahzad Wasim to chant anti-opposition slogans.
Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani kept on asking them to go to their seats and exercise their right to protest from there, but to no avail.
Dr Wasim said Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government was the first one in the country’s history that had formulated the NSP paper. Talking about the economic security, he said the PPP went to the International Monetary Fund 10 times and the PML-N got lending from it four times during their days in power. He said both parties got the IMF loans but never made structural reforms.
PML-N Senator Afnanullah Khan said the spirit of the NSP, as reported in the press, was not bad but most of its points were general and not specific. It states that security of citizens and the economy will be central, but the document doesn’t tell how both these targets would be achieved, he argued.
The opposition lawmaker said that if the economy would be central then all resources would have to be redirected towards revival of the economy. He said the opposition should have been taken into confidence when the NSP was being framed.
Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Muhammad Khan informed the house during the question hour that out of around 14,000 employees of the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra), only six, including Director General Ali Nawaz Malik, were on deputation and none of the six was a retired military officer.
In reply to a volley of supplementary questions about the number of retired army officers permanently absorbed in Nadra, their designations and ‘special qualification’, Mr Khan claimed that no one had been given special privilege and promised to share the details with the Senate.
