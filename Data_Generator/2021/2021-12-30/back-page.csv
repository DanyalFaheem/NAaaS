0,First wife alone can challenge husband’s second marriage: LHC,Complainant claims his brother-in-law contracted a second marriage on a forged permission letter.,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has ruled that only the first wife can challenge the second marriage of her husband if contracted without her permission. 
Justice Muhammad Amjad Rafiq issued the ruling quashing a first information report (FIR) against a man registered on an application by his brother-in-law for contracting a second marriage allegedly without the mandatory permission from his first wife. 
The Sheikhupura police had registered the impugned FIR in 2013 against Ghazanfar Naveed, the petitioner seeking quashment, on the complaint of the brother of his first wife. Earlier, another FIR was registered in 2011 against him on a similar charge by the same complainant, which was cancelled by a judicial magistrate. 
The complainant then lodged the impugned FIR based on the same plea, though with a twist that Naveed contracted a second marriage by preparing a forged permission letter purportedly issued by his first wife. The matter had been pending before a magistrate for trial since 2013. 

Complainant claims his brother-in-law contracted a second marriage on a forged permission letter 

The counsel for the petitioner mainly argued that under the dicta laid down by the Supreme Court in the famous case of ‘Ms. Sughran Bibi v. The State’ (PLD 2018 SC 595), no second FIR was permissible on the same facts and there was no difference between the two FIRs against the petitioner. 
He said the matter was between the spouses and touched the terms and conditions of a marriage certificate/nikahnama and in such an eventuality the ordinary court loses jurisdiction in view of special provisions contained in the Family Courts Act, 1964. 
On the other hand, the counsel for the complainant argued that this was not a matter to be tried by a family court because the alleged forgery committed by the petitioner did not fall within the purview of a family dispute. 
Justice Rafiq, in his verdict, observed that it is trite that a second FIR is not permissible under the law and that every version in an FIR put forward by the same complainant or different parties to the proceedings would be recorded in the same FIR and if the first stood cancelled, the party concerned may file a private complaint or an application for review of the cancellation order. 
In the present case, since the complainant has not done this, there was no occasion for him to get another FIR lodged, the judge added. The judge noted that whether the permission letter was forged or genuine is an issue to be decided by the family court. 
He further observed that so far, the first wife had not challenged the second marriage of her husband/petitioner, who is the aggrieved party, in terms of filing a complaint under Section 6(5) of The Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961. The judge maintained that the complainant, being a brother of the first wife, cannot be termed an aggrieved party nor can he be authorised to file such a complaint. 
“When the first wife, being sine qua non for initiating the proceedings, an alternative illegal course, that too through a person not aggrieved at all, is nothing but farce,” Justice Rafiq ruled. 
He declared that the magistrate was not justified in taking cognisance of the case, which was exclusively triable by a family court. Allowing the petition, the judge declared that the impugned FIR was not competent under the law and quashed the same. 
However, he observed that the wife may agitate before the family court by filing a complaint with the grievance on the touchstone of her husband contracting a second marriage without her permission.

1,250 Hindus invited to century-old shrine in KP,"Pilgrims from India, UAE and the US will arrive in Peshawar on Jan 1 to visit the shrine of Paramhans Ji Maharaaj in Karak.","ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Hindu Council (PHC) has invited a group of 250 Hindus to visit the country in an attempt to encourage “faith tourism”. 
The group will visit the shrine (Samadhi) of Paramhans Ji Maharaaj, a saint who had died at Teri village, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Karak district, in 1919.
“A number of Hindu pilgrims from India, the United Arab Emirates and the United States will arrive in Peshawar on Jan 1 to visit the Samadhi at Teri,” Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani, the PHC’s patron, told Dawn. 
The Hindu Council has arranged the programme in collaboration with Pakistan International Airlines.
“This is the second time that the council has invited Hindu pilgrims from other countries so that they can see for themselves the existence of a tolerant and pluralistic society in Pakistan,” said Dr Vankwani. 
Fifty-four Hindus from India, Canada, Singapore, Australia and Spain had visited the country last month. 
The group was led by Shri Satguru Ji Maharaaj Ji, the fifth successor of Paramhans Ji Maharaaj.
Chief Justice of Pakistan Justice Gulzar Ahmad had celebrated the Diwali festival at Teri temple last month to express solidarity with local members of the Hindu community and to welcome pilgrims from other parts of the country.
According to Mr Vankwani, the PHC invited the CJP only to give a message to “hate-mongers that the state is determined to foil their nefarious designs”.
In his speech at Teri temple, the CJP had assured the Hindu community that they enjoyed the same rights as other Pakistanis. Justice Gulzar Ahmed recalled the Quaid-i-Azam’s Aug 11, 1947, speech in which he had outlined his vision of a Pakistan which would be a model of tolerance and enlightenment.
The shrine at Teri was built in 1920 to honour the memory of Shri Param Hans Ji Maharaaj. A mob led by a local leader of the Jamiat Ulema-i- Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) had vandalised it on Dec 30 last year. The temple had come under attack way back in 1997 as well. 
The provincial government carried out extensive repairs on the orders of Chief Justice Gulzar Ahmed to restore it to its old glory. The apex court told the provincial government in October to recover Rs33 million from the culprits guilty of damaging the monument.
Dr Vankwani had sought the Supreme Court’s help in 2015 to restart the annual pilgrimage to the place.

2,PM Imran calls allies’ meeting on mini-budget today,National Assembly agenda shows bill will not be passed today.,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday called a meeting of the parliamentary groups of parties included in the ruling alliance led by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on Thursday (today) amid the government’s plan to introduce the controversial supplementary finance bill — or the mini-budget as the opposition called it — in the National Assembly the same day.
According to the agenda of the National Assembly for Thursday, Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin will introduce the bill in the house to amend certain laws relating to taxes and duties [the Finance (Supplementary) Bill 2021].

NA agenda shows bill will not be passed today

The meeting of the parliamentary group of the ruling alliance will be held at 2pm in the Parliament House. Prime Minister Khan will be in the chair.
According to the agenda of the lower house, the bill will only be introduced, and not passed, on Thursday.
Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry had after a cabinet meeting on Tuesday said that a separate cabinet meeting would be held on the issue of mini-budget during which all government allies would be taken into confidence.
As the opposition has already vowed to block the passage of the bill, fireworks are expected during the NA session. The opposition has claimed that the bill will further increase inflation and add to people’s misery.
The two bills are pending approval from parliament without which the revival of the IMF programme will not be possible. 
A senior official said that the cabinet could not consider the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Autonomy Bill on Tuesday because the law minister was not present at the meeting. So the cabinet’s ratification on the work finalised by the Cabinet Committee on Legislative Business could not be taken up. Secondly, the Tax Laws (Fourth) Amendment Bill was withdrawn because the government could not afford a backlash when the CPI-based inflation already stood at 11.53 per cent for November.

3,Covid-19 cases across world post record,The huge numbers of infected persons mean that hospitals in some countries may soon be overwhelmed.,"SYDNEY: Global Covid-19 infections hit a record high over the past seven-day period, a tally showed on Wednesday, as the new Omicron variant raced out of control, keeping workers at home and overwhelming testing centres. 
Almost 900,000 cases were detected on average each day around the world between Dec 22 and Dec 28, with myriad countries posting new all-time highs over the past 24 hours, including the United States, Australia and many European nations. 
Almost two years after China first reported a cluster of “viral pneumonia” cases in the city of Wuhan, the regularly mutating coronavirus is still wreaking havoc, forcing numerous governments to rethink quarantine and test rules. 
Although studies have suggested the Omicron variant is less deadly than some of its predecessors, the huge numbers of people testing positive mean that hospitals in some countries might soon be overwhelmed, while businesses might struggle to carry on operating because of workers having to quarantine. 

The huge numbers of infected persons mean that hospitals in some countries may soon be overwhelmed

France, Britain, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Cyprus and Malta all registered a record number of new cases on Tuesday, while the average number of daily Covid-19 cases in the United States hit a record 258,312 over the past seven days, according to a tally on Wednesday. 
The previous peak was a figure of 250,141 registered in early January, this year. 
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Wednesday that 90 per cent of patients ending up in intensive care had not received booster vaccines, which medics say is the best protection against the infectious Omicron. 
“The Omicron variant continues to cause real problems, you’re seeing cases rising in hospitals, but it is obviously milder than the Delta variant,” Johnson said. 
New daily infections in Australia spiked to nearly 18,300 on Wednesday, eclipsing the previous pandemic high of around 11,300 hit a day earlier. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said his country needed “a gear change” to manage overburdened laboratories, with long walk-in and drive-in queues reported in a number of areas. 
Testing bottlenecks have also emerged in European nations, including Spain where demand for free Covid-19 testing kits provided by Madrid’s regional government have far outstripped supply, with long queues forming outside pharmacies.
