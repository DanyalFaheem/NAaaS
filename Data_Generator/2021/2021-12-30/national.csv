2,"Centre, Punjab, State Life ink MoU for health insurance","PM witnesses signing ceremony; SAPM expects Sindh, Balochistan will join the programme soon.","ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday witnessed the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) by State Life Insurance Corporation (SLIC) and the federal and Punjab governments to ensure up to Rs1 million annual health insurance for the population of Islamabad and Punjab.
National Health Services Secretary Aamir Ashraf Khwaja, Chief Executive Officer of Punjab Health Initiatives Management Company Ali Razaq and SLIC Chairman Shoaib Javed Hussain signed the MoU for implementation of universal health coverage of Sehat Sahulat Programme in Punjab and Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT).
Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on Health Dr Faisal Sultan, Punjab Health Minister Dr Yasmin Rashid and senior officials were also present on the occasion.
During his visit to Lahore on December 13, Prime Minister Khan had announced Sehat Sahulat Programme for all residents of Punjab.

PM witnesses signing ceremony; SAPM expects Sindh, Balochistan will join the programme soon

Through this social health protection initiative, the poor families holding the health cards will be provided free of cost health insurance to secure indoor healthcare services worth Rs1m per family per year from hospitals on its panel, according to a statement.
The services include open-heart surgeries, insertion of stents, management of cancer, neurosurgical procures, burn management, accident management, dialysis, intensive care management, deliveries, C-section and other medical/surgical procedures along with kidney transplant. There is a facility of inter-provincial/inter-district portability for availing free of cost services from any empanelled hospital in Pakistan.
SLIC had on November 11 won the contract for health insurance cards for the next three years. SAPM on Health Dr Faisal Sultan had earlier said the Ministry of National Health Services (NHS) along with the Punjab government started the process for procurement of an insurance company for the years 2022-25 to implement the Sehat Sahulat Programme as per the prime minister’s directives.
From December 31, 2021, the Sehat Sahulat Programme and Qaumi Sehat Card will be gradually expanded to all permanent residents of ICT, Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan.
The programme, entirely funded by the government, has already covered all permanent residents of the newly merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Tharparkar in Sindh and Azad Jammu and Kashmir along with persons with permanent disability and the transgender community.
The SAPM expressed the hope that the Sindh and Balochistan governments would also join the insurance programme soon to materialise the dream of national universal health insurance by providing Qaumi Sehat Cards to each and every citizen of Pakistan as this will keep them protected against catastrophic healthcare expenditures of millions of rupees for serious issues like cardiac surgeries, cancer treatment, renal failure and so on.
“Sehat Sahulat is the flagship programme of the government as per the vision and directives of Prime Minister Imran Khan, through which support and assistance are provided against catastrophic healthcare expenditure. This scheme will bring robust improvement in treatment and access to quality healthcare services to population and will bring about a revolution in the health sector,” Dr Sultan added.

3,RED ZONE FILES: Sea of troubles,2022 is going to be turbulent. Especially if you’re in the ruling party.,"PTI is in a spot of bother. It may not accept it, but it sure looks it. From its vantage point, 2022 seems a steep mountain to climb. Five clear and present dangers stare the ruling party in the eye.
1- The darn mini-budget. Heads you win, tails I lose. Today the federal cabinet is set to meet specially to discuss, debate and probably approve the mini-budget — also called the money bill — that is required to be passed by the parliament if the government wants to re-enter the IMF programme. It was deferred in the last cabinet meeting because many ministers including most among the allied parties expressed reservations. They had good reason to. The bill if passed will unleash a new wave of devastating inflation and deliver political body blows to an already beleaguered government. There is restlessness among the PTI flock. What if they can’t muster the parliamentary numbers? A defeat of a money bill is considered a vote of no confidence in the leader of the house. Things could crumble like a pack of cards. Mortal thoughts haunt the treasury benches. Some have even nervously joked about the unmentionable: serving in the opposition. No one is laughing.
But not yet, the PM says. His body language is positive and upbeat, says a Red Zone insider who has been in his presence. He is living his own ghabrana nahi hai slogan, even though most others in his team are not. The technical knockout, were it to happen, will happen as soon as the bill is put to vote. That could be any day. Literally. Except that it may not. The opposition is talking the big talk but not walking it. The sense from inside the Red Zone is that the opposition also feels this is too soon to plunge the knife into the government’s belly, and twist it. The stars are not aligned. The talks are not done. The new arrangement is not stitched up. The government may yet live. But crippled. And cowering under the threat of the final blow. “Wait till March,” says an opposition leader. If the government survives the money bill, can it also survive its effects?
Red Zone Files: With its fortress breached, the PTI may now find itself fighting for its political survival
2- Dealing with those Noonies. Why don’t these guys just give up? A common lament nowadays is often heard among the ruling party circles. These PML-N people have been ousted, hounded, maligned, jailed and thrown under the juggernaut of the state’s wrath. And yet, here they are ready to make a comeback without having lost much in terms of elecatables, workers and supporters. Nawaz Sharif may or may not return but his party will. That’s the buzz in town. And that’s a buzz that is infuriating the party whose politics was based on the destruction of the Sharifs. PTI today is fighting not just against the PML-N but the very idea of the PML-N. It is an idea that has grown stronger in inverse proportion to the governance woes of the PTI. It’s hard to jail an idea, howsoever good or bad it might be. PTI spokespersons are shadow boxing. The threat has just become bigger and the habitual vitriol by the spokespersons a little irrelevant. How do you block the new narrative when you may be under threat of drowning in it?
3- Pining for friends with benefits. Where are they when you need them and their friendly phone calls? PTI is feeling lonesome. Friends are stepping back to mind to their own affairs and this has consequences. Red Zone insiders have confirmed that the institution that has facilitated PTI through good time and bad — as friends do — has now made a deliberate decision to let the PTI experiment with its own self-sufficiency. The Usman Buzdar government in the Punjab is also pulling on its woolies to protect itself from the frost replacing the traditional warmth. And yet, many within the ruling party are experiencing involuntary shivers. What if the bill came, and the phone calls did not? What if a no-trust came, and phone calls did not? How do you win back friends you have lost because of your own behaviour? The Red Zone wonders.
4- Banking on a big over. Can the PM hit it out of the park on the last ball? As the walls close in — metaphorically — the PM is said to be deliberating on options A-Z to find good ones. It’s a tough search. He knows he has an appointment to make at some point in the coming months. He also knows the appointment has consequences. The drastic sort. Many political people are also weighing all options in reference to the consequences of the appointment. You lay these options over each other and a common timeline comes into view. It does not extend beyond a few months. Tops. In a battle waged in cramped space and time, everything depends on who strikes first. And strikes hard. That big over will need to be really big. An inch makes the difference between crossing the boundary and getting caught. Who knows this better than the captain?
Read: Without a course correction, PTI's party may be over sooner than its leaders think
5- PTI vs. PTI — again. Stung by the drubbing in KP, the chairman of PTI threw out the constitution of PTI, the office-bearers of PTI and the entire party structure of PTI. Except, according to many PTI insiders, he can’t. Not according to the constitution of 2019 which he has thrown out. The chicken-and-egg dilemma is making an omelette out of intra-PTI frustrations. Many within the party were caught unawares when the chairman took the drastic steps and handed over party offices to sitting ministers. Those involved deeply in party affairs say the 2019 party constitution was made over a period of many months after deep and wide consultations with all key stakeholders. It was adopted and signed by the chairman. Nowhere in the constitution does it say that it can be discarded with a tweet. It is a legal issue and the ECP can take notice. Or someone from the party can go to court. In fact, someone just might. He also has a name. That name is weighing options, say Red Zone insiders. That is one more front that PTI did not need to open. But then what good is the PTI if it cannot fight the PTI?
Buckle up. 2022 is going to be turbulent. Especially if you’re in the ruling party.
To be, or not to be, that is the question,
Whether ‘tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them?
(Shakespeare, Hamlet)

4,FIA recovers Rs1.2bn from suspects of financial crimes this year,Says anti-corruption drive will help govt meet FATF’s requirements.,"ISLAMABAD: The Federal Inves­ti­gation Agency (FIA) has recovered Rs1.273 billion from 422 suspects in 335 cases of financial crimes during the current year in compliance with the action plan for the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).
Pakistan has been on the grey list of the FATF since 2018. The FATF had in its October 2021 meeting acknowledged “good progress” made by the country, but retained it on the grey list and called upon the government to exhibit terror financing investigations against and prosecution of top cadres of UN-designated terror groups.
According to the FIA statistics, 95 cases of financial crimes were registered during December alone, including those against illegal currency dealers and persons involved in hawala/hundi (illegal money transfer business). As many as 127 suspects were arrested and Rs201 million and foreign currency equivalent to Rs89m were seized.
On the references sent by the State of Pakistan, 32 cases were registered, as many persons arrested and Rs61m and foreign currency worth Rs31.61m recovered. Likewise, 271 cases related to suspicious bank transactions and against currency exchange companies were registered.

Says anti-corruption drive will help govt meet FATF’s requirements

The FIA has registered hundreds of FIRs during its anti-corruption drive and found 46 suspects nominated in the cases involved in money laundering during investigations. As a result, more cases were registered under which Rs208m was seized.
During the last nine months, the FIA registered 312 FIRs related to hawala/hundi, arrested suspects and seized Rs897m. After completing investigations, challans against these suspects have been sent to the court.
On the reports of the intelligence agencies, 103 cases were registered, 140 accused arrested and Rs530m in domestic and foreign currency was recovered.
FIA Director Waqar Chauhan said during a press briefing on Wednesday that Pakistan extended cooperation with Interpol and other agencies and enhanced collaboration with regard to keeping check on overseas properties bought by Pakistani nationals or arrest of suspects involved in financial crimes. In this regard, more than 650 Mutual Legal Assistance requests have been sent to Interpol this year.
Throughout this campaign, constant liaison and cooperation had been maintained with the State Bank of Pakistan’s Financial Monitoring Unit and other agencies, he added.
Mr Chauhan said that in the coming days, the FIA would continue cracking down on financial crimes, which were hurting the national economy.
All of the above actions are also required in the FATF action plan. However, the performance of the FIA was above the requirements/targets given by the FATF, he added.
As a result of the campaign, the FIA had achieved significant results against financial crimes, Mr Chauhan said, adding that the agency continued to take effective action against money laundering in the light of the National Risk Assessment-2019 and other administrative, operational and legal measures of the government.
