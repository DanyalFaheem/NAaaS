4,"Govt, opposition lawmakers in Punjab discuss local govt system in rare unity",Law Minister Basharat Raja agrees to give as much time as the opposition members will seek to put up the suggestions.,"LAHORE: The treasury and opposition lawmakers sat together for the first time in a standing committee here on Wednesday to discuss the all-important new local body system the government has introduced through an ordinance.
The opposition had been boycotting all standing committees for the last three and a half years as a protest against the government’s deviation from the past tradition of nominating the opposition leader as the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee.
The meeting presided over by Standing Committee on Local Government chairman Farooqullah Dareshak was attended by representatives of the ruling PTI, government’s ally PML-Q, opposition PML-N and PPP.
Local Government Secretary Nurul Amin Mengal briefed the participants on the key features of the ordinance.
Welcoming the opposition lawmakers, Local Government Minister Mian Mahmoodur Rashid said the treasury wished to take along the political rivals for the important lawmaking and hoped that all would give their input with good intentions.
Mr Dareshak assured all those in attendance that whatever the committee would decide with mutual consultation would be tabled in the Punjab Assembly without any change.
The opposition members initially suggested restoration of town committees and municipal committees which had been abolished in the ordinance. However, they sought time to discuss threadbare the ordinance in their respective parties before coming up with their final suggestions for making it a model law.
Law Minister Muhammad Basharat Raja agreed to give as much time as the opposition members would seek and giving due consideration to the suggestions to be put up by them.
It was decided to hold the next meeting of the committee on Jan 10, 2022.
Those in attendance were ministers Mian Aslam Iqbal and Makhdoom Hashim Jawan Bakht, parliamentary secretary Sajid Bhatti, PML-N’s Samiullah Khan, Malik Muhammad Ahmed Khan, Awais Leghari, Ramzan Bhatti, Chaudhry Shafiq Anwar, Zeeshan Rafique, Sajjad Haider Nadeem, Zafar Iqbal Nagra and Javed Alauddin; PTI’s Gulraiz Afzal, Aminullah Khan and Momina Waheed, and PPP’s Usman Mahmood.
Though the Punjab government claims to have finalised the new local government (LG) system “with consensus”, it is facing a strong reaction from the opposition parties for completely ignoring the rural-urban divide in 26 districts of the province.
Only eight metropolitan corporations, besides Gujrat and Sialkot, will have segregation of rural and urban areas, but even these cities won’t have this division at tehsil level.
The opposition sees confrontation in the proposed LG assemblies as the district mayor elected with millions of votes could face resistance from a deputy mayor at tehsil level belonging to a different party in the running of the assembly affairs.
As the Local Government Ordinance 2021 has been presented in the Punjab Assembly, Speaker Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi asked the ruling PTI to take opposition on board and got a committee, comprising 11 treasury and nine opposition members, constituted to discuss the ordinance clause by clause to build a consensus.
As tenure of the incumbent local governments ends on Dec 31 (tomorrow), the Punjab government has finalised appointment of deputy commissioners as administrators in the districts, as was the case when the LGs were suspended by the PTI government in May 2019.
“The transition of local governments as per the new law will be considered after the upcoming LG polls in the province,” a senior officer told Dawn.
Meanwhile, Chief Minister Usman Buzdar on Wednesday reviewed the system of devolution of powers through the new Local Government Act.
The chief minister, in a meeting held in this regard, said the provincial cabinet had already approved the new local government law aimed at empowering people.
He said the new system had been finalised with consensus and this would play an important role in resolving the people’s problems at their doorstep.
Mr Buzdar said the direct elections of mayors and other local government heads would be held for the first time as this system would start a new era of development at the grassroots level.
Provincial ministers Basharat Raja, Mian Mahmoodur Rashid, Hashim Jawan Bakht, local government department secretary also attended the meeting.

7,Ahsan deplores country’s isolation on diplomatic front,NAROWAL: PML-N Secretary General Ahsan Iqbal says the country’s isolation is a matter of concern for all.,"NAROWAL: PML-N Secretary General Ahsan Iqbal says the country’s isolation is a matter of concern for all.
Speaking at a farewell function in the honour of mayors and the district councils’ chairmen, he said it’s unfortunate that Pakistan was suffering from the worst isolation on diplomatic front.
“If China is not angry with us over CPEC, it is not happy either. China gave billions of dollars to Pakistan at a time when no other country was willing to invest. We have accused a sincere friend like China of corruption,” he said.
“The United States does not want to talk to us today because of our foreign policies,” he said. The friendly countries of the Middle East who used to come to Pakistan and give dollars for development, were giving loans on stringent terms,” he said.
He also regretted that Pakistani society was heading towards the worst kind of extremism. “The Sialkot tragedy has given us a glimpse of this extremism. I was also shot because of extremism,” he said.
The only way to bring the country out of the multiple problems was that it should be run on constitutional path, he said. “Pakistan should be run under a democratic system of government because no other system can work. We have seen 35 years of presidential system of government in this country. Every presidential system of government has weakened Pakistan. Bringing the central system in the country deprives the provincial system of growth,” he said. He said rule of law should be enforced in the country.
Later, Ahsan Iqbal distributed shields among the mayors and chairmen of the district councils from across Punjab.
Mr Iqbal, a former interior minister, and mayors and chairmen also visited Gurdwara Darbar Sahib at Kartarpur. They were received at Gurdwara Darbar Sahib by Project Management Unit Chief Executive Officer Muhammad Latif and MPA Sardar Ramesh Singh Arora.

8,Stray dog’s attack on seven pedestrians panics populace in Bahawalnagar,Residents allege that packs of stray dogs bit many people earlier but the MC officials remained indifferent to public nuisance.,"BAHAWALNAGAR: People living around Lorry Adda area are in panic after a stray dog bit seven pedestrians including women and children at the main market on Tuesday night.
The Municipal Committee officials failed to catch the dog by Wednesday evening. They also were unable to eliminate the packs of stray dogs from the city and its surroundings because of unavailability of poison.
Citizens said a stray dog bit Arshad Ahmad, 12, Mehvish, 16, Maryam, 17, Fouzia, 19, Shahzad, 19, Muhammad Habib, 20, and Muhammad Alam, 30, at the main market of Minchinabad. The injured were shifted to the THQ hospital on a self-help basis.
They said some people tried to catch the dog but in vain. Officials of the Municipal Committee, they said, had failed to eliminate the packs of dogs and were instead making announcements through mosques asking people to remain indoors and save themselves from stray dogs.
The residents alleged that packs of stray dogs bit many people earlier but the MC officials remained indifferent to public nuisance.
Municipal Committee Chief Officer Rashid Ghaznavi was not available for comment. However, an official of the MC Minchinabad, while requesting anonymity, told Dawn that the MC as well as the health department had no poison available to kill the stray dogs.
The official said that despite strict government instructions, no campaign to eradicate stray dogs was launched the whole year through.
THQ Medical Superintendent Dr Hasnain Shah said the seven affected people were vaccinated soon after they were brought to the hospital.
He said it was the duty of the deputy district health officer or the MC office to arrange poison or to take any other steps to kill stray dogs.
Minchinabad Assistant Commissioner Javed Ahmad Cheema said they had acquired poison from the DHQ hospital on an emergency basis and the drive to eliminate the stray dogs had been launched.

Mr Khawar, flanked by Senior Board of Revenue Member Babar Hayat Tarar, told reporters on Wednesday Shahbaz Sharif, the guarantor of his fugitive brother, was himself involved in money laundering of Rs16 billion. He said the Sharif family made Pakistan a resort for their political tourism as only their politics was in Pakistan, while their businesses, properties and children were out of the country. In the current situation, he said, there was no room for any deal or relaxation for the opposition.
About the mini-budget, he said the opposition should have a solid and viable economic plan apart from simply criticizing the mini-budget. He said there was a big difference between Sindh and Punjab’s local government ordinances. He said Punjab’s system of local government would empower the local government representatives, unlike the toothless system of Sindh.
He said local government elections would be held on time and it would be a historic system of Pakistan.
He said the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government had increased public revenue through austerity measures and efficient economic reforms. He said amendments and improvements to the current governance model were part of the PTI’s manifesto and the vision of Prime Minister Imran Khan. In the journey of fulfilling this vision, he said, Chief Minister Usman Buzdar had introduced revolutionary measures in education, health, local government system, police and other important institutions including the revenue department.
He said the purpose of rural revenue centres was to provide services to the people at their doorsteps. Out of the target of 8,000 rural revenue centres of the Punjab government, he said, 1,139 centres were functional and 4,000 more would be made operational from Jan 3.
He said the 4,000 rural revenue centers were being completed five months before their given date of completion. Instead of spending billions of rupees on this project, he said the government thriftily used the existing government infrastructure and facilities.
Mr Khawar said one window e-service centers at tehsil level were providing all services to the people reducing the chances of fraud at the same time. He said the Revenue Courts Management System, neglected for a long time, had been made functional to assess and minimise the backlog of pending cases. In the short period from April to December 2021, he said, the number of pending cases dropped from 117,000 to 63,000. Similarly, out of 441 cases pending in the court of SMBR, only two cases remained pending now.
He said action had been taken against 400 people of the revenue department involved in corruption and 150 people have been sacked.
