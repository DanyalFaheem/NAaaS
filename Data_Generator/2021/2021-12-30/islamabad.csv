The victim’s wife was among those arrested.
According to the police, the deceased was identified as Mohammad Shakeel, a resident of Bhara Kahu, who worked with the Iraqi embassy in Islamabad. A case was registered with Kohsar police against unidentified person(s) on Nov 14 in response to a complaint lodged by the victim’s brother, Abdul Hamid.
Station House Officer (SHO) of Kohsar police Sub-Inspector (SI) Shabbir Tanoli told Dawn that the victim’s wife had alleged that they were sitting near Daman-i-Koh when two persons appeared on the scene and dragged her husband into the wooded area.
After a while, she heard gunshots and when she rushed into the woods, she found her husband dead with a bullet injury to his head, the SI added.
The woman also claimed that the two attackers snatched a purse and three rings from them, the SHO said, adding that however, when an amount of Rs50,000 was recovered from the victim, doubts arose about the woman’s statement about the incident.
During the investigation, the police confiscated the woman’s mobile phone over suspicion and during investigation, it was revealed that the victim and the woman were first cousins and were natives of Mansehra, SI Tanoli said, adding that they had married three weeks ago.
He said on examining the woman’s mobile phone, they found a message on Snapchat from a man which further raised our suspicion.
The investigators then picked up the man for interrogation and confiscated his mobile phone as well, Tanoli said, adding that, “they also found the woman’s message on Snapchat and on probing him, the suspect revealed that he and the woman wanted to marry, but she had been forced into marrying the victim.
The woman was in distress over her marriage against her will and told the suspect that she was thinking of committing suicide, Mr Tanoli quoted the suspect as saying.
“However, the suspect told her to murder her husband instead and offered to help her in it,” he said, adding that they planned the murder and the woman brought her husband to Daman-i-Koh where he attacked him.
“During the scuffle between them, the suspect fired at Shakeel, which caused his death on the spot,” SI Tanoli said, adding that after his confession, the police arrested the woman and both will be produced in court on Thursday (today) to seek their physical remand.

1,Mandir committee to help resolve differences among Hindus: minister,"Says body to supervise, manage temples","ISLAMABAD: Minister for Religious Affairs Pir Noorul Haq Qadri on Wednesday said that the Pakistan Hindu Mandirs Management Committee would be responsible for the supervision and general management of Hindu temples across the country.
Chairing the first meeting of the committee, he also noted that the committee was the official forum to highlight and help resolve the problems faced by the members of Hindu community, instead of leaving this responsibility to NGOs and individuals.
Since most of the temples are under the administrative control of the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) and the funds for their repair works as well as general maintenance is provided by the Board, the “Pakistan Hindu Mandirs Management Committee” will act as a subordinate body of the ETPB.
The committee was established in November, after it was noted that issues related to the general management of temples, extending help to pilgrims and even exercising worships at some places needed to be resolved with the help of community members.

Says body to supervise, manage temples

The ETPB has already established a “Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee” in 1999 for maintenance of Sikh religious institutions and places of worships in Pakistan.
The minister for religious affairs said the government wanted to promote harmony among people of different cultures in the region.
“Some elements wanted to promote confrontation in Pakistan on the basis of religion, sect and ethnicity,” he said.
He said the new committee would act as a bridge between the Hindus and the state.
ETPB Chairman Dr Aamer Ahmed informed the committee members that there were two categories of temples in the country.
The category one temples are those situated in localities with sizeable Hindu population and are managed by the community themselves.
“The temples in Bhong, Rahim Yar Khan, Punjab fall in this category, while the other category includes temples which are managed by the ETPB, like the shrine and temple in Teri, Karak,” Dr Ahmed said.
The members of the committee including the officials of the ministry and the ETPB acknowledged that not much has been done in the past to include members of Hindu community in the affairs of their religious institutions.
It was also noted that the communication gaps between the state functionaries and the Hindu community was spreading misconceptions and disinformation by certain individuals and some NGOs.
While speaking at the meeting Krishna Sharma, belonging to Mithi, Sindh said that traditionally such committees are established in the country by governments either to fulfill the constitutional requirements or to adjust their supporters.
“However we will like to see this body as a platform for solving problems of Hindu community, and it was possible only with the help of state institutions,” Mr Sharma said.
The members of the committee including Dewan Chand Chawla, Ashok Kumar from Sindh, Ameet Kumar Shadani, Mohan Das and Niranjan Kumar, Virse Mal Dewani from Balochistan, Amarnath Randhawa, Lahore and Ms Megha Arora, from Punjab and Haroon Sarab Diyal from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa attended the meeting.
The ex-officio members of the committee are ETPB chairman, Joint Secretary Ministry of Religious Affairs and the secretary to the committee will be the Additional Secretary (Shrines), ETPB.
The committee will also be responsible for facilitating to both local and foreign Hindu yatrees (pilgrims) and to make their journey and stay within Pakistan as comfortable as possible, apart from other necessary arrangements related to their reception and farewell on each religious occasion.
The meeting noted that the committee should promote religious tourism for the Hindu community spreading world over.

2,Centuries-old trees being chopped for road expansion in Taxila,Assistant commissioner says necessary approval has been granted by the forest department for chopping the trees.,"TAXILA: Scores of old trees, including the precious Shisham (Indian Rose Wood), are being cut for the ongoing expansion of Museum Road, which is being opposed by the residents of the area.
These trees, planted along Taxila-Khanpur Road during the colonial era, are being chopped down as the government moves ahead with its plan to expand the road to enable smooth flow of trucks, dumpers and trailers. 
However, the area residents have taken a stand to save these precious trees.
“We take shelter under the cool shade of this ancient tree in sweltering summers when there is no electricity,” said 60-year-old Naseem Butt about an over 100-year-old tree which has come in the way of the Museum Road project.
“I have been seeing this tree all my life; we grew up under it,” he said, adding that these trees were centuries old and were planted by the British rulers to facilitate travellers.
Malik Tahir Suleman, a social activist, said the locals did not want the trees to be cut.
“I have seen the tree in the same place for the past six decades and elders used to say the same about it,” he said.
Mr Suleman said no environmental study had been carried out before the project’s execution.
“Trees that are part of our heritage should be protected rather than being chopped for expanding the road,” he said.
He called on the environmental watchdogs to intervene in the matter and play their role in preserving or relocating the trees to the nearby areas.
Rashid Khan, a sculptor, said hundreds of local artists have set up their makeshift stalls under these trees, producing various types of decorative items through black stone and marble.
Ameen Khan, another master artisan said: “I have been carving stone for several decades under these trees and it saddens me that these trees are being chopped only for a few feet of expansion to please the powerful stone crusher mafia.”
When contacted, Assistant Commissioner Shahzad Mehboob said the trees were being cut down by the Punjab Highway Department to expand the road and the necessary approval had been granted by the forest department.
It has issued a no-objection certificate for chopping down the trees, Mr Mehboob said.
Forest officer Khurram Shahzad said on the request of provincial authorities, cutting down of these trees had been allowed, adding that the contract was awarded after open auction and approval of the relevant district and provincial authorities.
Responding to another question, he admitted that these trees were of historical importance and eco-friendly, however he clarified that the chopping down was allowed in “best public interest”.

6,"Separate winter break schedules for Rawalpindi’s schools, colleges perturb parents",CEO District Education Authority says the government has said that the NCOC’s directions should be followed.,"RAWALPINDI: Higher educational institutions and secondary schools, both in private and public sector, in Rawalpindi are observing separate winter vacation schedule due to lack of coordination between different sections of the Punjab Education Department.
As per the notification issued by the Higher Education Department (HED) Punjab, the public and private sector higher education institutions had been observing winter holidays from Dec 23 to Jan 6 whereas educational institutions in 12 other districts will go on winter break from Jan 3 to 13th.
As the mercury dropped to 1 degree Celsius, parents find it difficult to send their children to school in the biting cold. Besides, different schedules have also disturbed holiday plans of parents. 
Punjab School Education Minister Murad Raas had recently announced that winter vacations in all public and private schools in 24 districts would start from Dec 23, whereas a notification issued by the School Education Department (SED) Punjab says that schools in rest of the 12 districts would observe vacation from Jan 3 to 13th. 
The notification reads that in view of the instructions of the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) and ongoing vaccination drive in schools, all educational institutions in Rawalpindi, Jhelum, Mianwali, Attock, Muzaffargarh, Chakwal, Bhakkar, Rajanpur, Layyah, Rahimyar Khan, D.G. Khan and Chiniot shall remain closed for winter vacation from Jan 3 to 13th while in the other 24 districts, winter vacation had started from Dec 23 to Jan 6.
“It is strange that students of primary and secondary schools are going to their education institutions in cold weather but the college and university students are on holidays. This cold can affect the health of small children,” said Mohammad Nasir, father of a student in Lalazar.
Abdul Qayum said he was from Gujrat and spent winter vacation in his native town but this year, due to different holiday schedules, his plans have been disturbed.
“My elder daughter is in college and she is on vacation while my two sons are in primary and are going to school,” he said.
He said when his daughter’s college would open, his sons would go on a winter break, adding that, “this spoke volumes about the lack of coordination between two sections of the same department”.
When contacted, District Education Authority Chief Executive Officer Mohammad Azam Kashif said as per directions of the provincial government, the schools in public and private sector would start winter vacation from Jan 3.
He said the government had said that the NCOC’s directions should be followed. However, he said the Punjab Education Department allowed 24 districts to start the winter vacations from Dec 23 due to fog or smog.
He said in Rawalpindi district, educational institutions in Murree, Kotli Sattian and Nar Union Council of Kahuta had been observing winter vacations since Dec 23, which would continue till March 4 as these areas received snow during this period.
He said it was the government’s duty to announce the winter vacation and the authority implemented in public and private-sector education institutions.

The committee members termed this “a major setback” which negatively impacted the quality of services.
The committee met under the chairmanship of Senator Dr Mohammad Humayun Mohmand at the Parliament House.
“One-third of the strength of the NIH is missing,” the committee chairman said.

Members told vacant seats to be filled in three months

The NIH representatives informed the committee members that the delay in appointments was caused on account of the new Act and regulations, however 10 days ago, regulations and advertisements were approved.
Appointments will be made in three months, the NIH officials said.

The committee was informed by Pakistan Medical Commission (PMC) that it had no objection to any quota of seats established by the federal government subject to the said admission not being “over and above” the allocated strength of each college and the students admitted.

“It is for the provincial government to implement any quota notified by the federal government”, a PMC representative said, adding “The PMC is not the admission agency for admissions to public medical and dental colleges and therefore, has no role to play in such admissions or enforcement of the quota”.

10,Islamabad's E-12 development in sight as CDA starts compensating villagers,"Sector E-12 was launched by the CDA in 1989 and over 4,000 people purchased plots, but they could not get possession to date.","ISLAMABAD: After a wait of 32 years, over 4,000 people would finally get possession of developed plots in E-12, which had been marred by a dispute between the Capital Development Authority (CDA) and the villagers.
On Wednesday, 162 of around 1,200 villagers were allotted alternative plots through balloting, paving the way to resolution of the long-running dispute that had been hampering development in the stalled sector.
The authority, through e-balloting conducted by National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) allotted plots of various sizes to 162 villagers.
Sector E-12 was launched by the CDA in 1989 and over 4,000 people purchased plots. However, despite the passage of 32 years, the plot owners had not been able to get possession.
On the other hand, the CDA failed to get possession of land for proper development of the sector due to pending compensation dispute with villagers, who had refused to leave the area until they were compensated by the civic body.
The matter was taken up by the Islamabad High Court (IHC), which formed a commission comprising the three members of the National Assembly (MNAs) from Islamabad - Planning Minister Asad Umar, Special Assistant on CDA Affairs Ali Nawaz Awan and National Assembly Standing Committee on Interior chairman Raja Khurram Nawaz.
After holding several meetings with the CDA and villagers, the commission decided to resolve the compensation issue with around 1,200 people.
Following its recommendation, the CDA conducted balloting for allotment of 162 plots of various sizes to people whose land and houses had been acquired by the civic body and were entitled to receive alternative plots.
Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on CDA Affairs Ali Nawaz Awan also attended the balloting ceremony.
Speaking on the occasion, Mr Awan said plot owners as well as the villagers had been facing problems for the past 32 years and the federal government deserved appreciation for resolving the longstanding dispute.
“This is strange, people whose land had been acquired for the capital city and residential sectors had not been compensated,” he said, adding that another balloting would be held on Jan 30 and others will be given their due right.
“It is the PTI government which is resolving this issue. I am thankful to the federal government, courts, the commission and Mr Umar for playing an active role in this regard,” he said.
He also appreciated CDA Chairman Amer Ali Ahmed, Member (Estate) Naveed Ilahi, Director (Land) Afnan Alam and his team for holding the balloting.
Later, talking to Dawn, Mr Awan said the genuine issues of all would be resolved and the CDA could not deny compensation to those who truly deserved it.
“This issue should have been settled 32 years ago as the CDA was bound to develop the sector within one year after its launch, but successive governments did not pay any heed towards such issues,” he added.
Earlier, the member estate said for ensuring transparency, balloting was being conducted by Nadra.
The CDA officials said after clearing dues of people, the civic agency could easily get possession of the entire sector and start development.

11,"IHC issues notices to law, interior secretaries",ISLAMABAD: Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday issued notices to secretaries of the ministries of law and interior...,"ISLAMABAD: Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday issued notices to secretaries of the ministries of law and interior on a petition filed against the recently-promulgated ordinance for holding direct election of mayor of the federal capital.
The petitioner, former chairman of a union council in I-9 Sardar Mehtab Ahmed Khan, has challenged the ‘Islamabad Capital Territory Local Government Ordinance 2021’, which abolished the election of mayor through the chairmen of union councils and also removed the post of deputy mayors.
The petitioner’s counsel, Qazi Adil Aziz, adopted before IHC Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani that earlier the local government (LG) elections were confined to the rural areas only, however, the LG Act 2015 extended their scope to the urban areas.
According to him, the legislature deemed it necessary that political, financial and administrative functions of the government be devolved to the grassroots level for the betterment of the people at large.
The petition said the Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI) was formed under the LG Act 2015 and several administrative and financial functions were devolved upon the MCI, adding that most of the departments transferred to the corporation were being managed by the Capital Development Authority (CDA).
Criticising the LG ordinance, the petition said this was promulgated without passing the necessary formalities.
It said the ordinance “introduced an altogether new structure of the local government in Islamabad and created multiple tiers within the local government. In doing so they have provided mechanism for direct election of the mayor of Islamabad, no deputy mayor, created ICT Council which would be an un-elected nominated body of members to be appointed/nominated by political parties, and neighbourhood councils which had no direct link even with the mayor of Islamabad.”
The petition contended that the said ordinance had repealed a law which was based upon an Act of Parliament and was passed after due course. It requested the court to set aside the presidential ordinance.
IHC Justice Kayani, after issuing notices to the respondent ministries, adjourned further hearing till Jan 11.
