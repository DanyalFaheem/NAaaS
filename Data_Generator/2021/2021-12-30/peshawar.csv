0,Foreigners team reaches Nanga Parbat base camp,"It will be the first attempt at any peak over 8,000 metres in Gilgit-Baltistan during this winter season.","GILGIT: Three members of a foreign expedition team have arrived at the base camp of the 8,126-meter Nanga Parbat to summit the killer mountain through the Rupal Face.
German climber David Göttler, Ita­lian Hervé Barmasse and American Mike Arnold are the members of Nanga Parbat winter expedition 2021-22.
Qudrat Ali, a Pakistani guide, and two cooks are also part of the expedition.
Meanwhile, a German photographer Paolo Sartori is also with the ex­p­edition, who will document the team’s progress and will return from the base camp.
It will be the first attempt at any peak over 8,000 meters in Gilgit-Baltistan during this winter season.
Rupal Face is a 4,500-meter tall wall that culminates at the 8,126-meter summit of Nanga Parbat.
According to the expedition officials, the climbers will try to ascend the largest unevenness in the world, of more than 4,500 meters tall wall, which couldn’t be summited in previous 10 winter attempts.
Naiknam Karim, chief executive officer of Adventure Tours of Pakistan, which has organised the expedition, told Dawn on Wednesday that the Nanga Parbat winter expedition team had established the base camp on Monday to acclimatise.
Italian mountaineer Reinhold Messner and his brother Gunther had made their first ascent of
Nanga Parbat through Rupal Face in 1970. The pair then traversed down the unexplored Diamir Face, where Gunther had died in an avalanche.
German climber David Göttler, through a social media post, said “Our chances of success are very, very slim. Nevertheless, since I was here in the winter of 2013-14, I’ve always wanted to come back to this mountain, on this side of it, and in this season,” he said.

1,Employees unpaid for four months as tribal TMAs strapped for cash,"LG minister says salaries will be paid in two, three days.","PESHAWAR: With almost no cash on hand, all 25 tehsil municipal administrations (TMAs) in the seven tribal districts haven’t paid salary to their over 1,000 employees for four months to their misery.
According to officials, the TMAs were established in Mohmand, Bajaur, Khyber, Kurram, Orakzai, North Waziristan and South Waziristan districts following the region’s merger with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
They told Dawn that the TMA funds were either local taxes or government funding but as the region was a tax-free zone, these civic bodies had to look to the provincial government for financial support.

LG minister says salaries will be paid in two, three days

The officials said the KP Local Council Board had formally requested the provincial government several months ago for funds to manage the running expenditure but the matter continued to be pending with the finance department.
“The TMAs require funds to pay salary to employees and pay for the fuel of official and sanitation vehicles, electric supply and office needs,” a tribal district TMO told Dawn on condition of anonymity.
He said the though the government had established TMAs soon after the Fata-KP merger, they would take time to generate money for own needs.
The TMO said the TMA employees had been struggling to make ends meet due to the long pay delays to make ends meet amid escalating prices of essential food items.
When asked how the cash-strapped TMAs manage vehicle fuel and repairs, he said heads of the tehsil administrations had promised filling station owners the payment of dues soon after the release of government funds.
The official said the situation had forced the TMA officials into borrowing money from friends and relatives to meet unavoidable expenses.
Officials in the provincial secretariat of the local government department told Dawn that for the tehsil council chairmen elected in the recent local body elections, it would be a challenge to manage the affairs of 25 tribal TMAs with no funds at their disposal.
The local body elections were held in 17 districts in the first phase and the districts included Khyber, Mohmand and Bajuar from the erstwhile Fata. The second phase of polls will take place in the remaining four tribal districts.
A senior official of the local government department told Dawn that the tribal TMAs set up a few years ago had not begun revenue generation.
He said the main sources of revenue for those TMAs were collection of taxes fromcattle fairs,bus stands, signboards, construction map approvals and fruit and vegetable markets, fee for issuing no objection certificates to housing societies, two per centdeductionfrom the sale of property, and public park contracts.
The official said the government also issued annual grant to TMAs when the federal government stopped them from collecting zila tax in 1999.
He said the tribal TMAs neither generated revenue nor did the government give them any grant.
The official said non-payment of salary had adversely affected the performance of employees, who had grown insecure about their jobs as well.
When contacted, local government minister Faisal Amin Gandapur said TMAs in tribal districts were financial weak for having no source of revenue as the ex-Fata had been declared a tax-free zone.
He said officials of the finance and local government departments discussed the matter lately.
“The finance department released funds on Tuesday, so these TMA employees will receive salaries in two or three days,” he said.

4,Man denied bail in Hindu girl kidnapping case,PESHAWAR: A local court has rejected the bail plea of a man accused of kidnapping a minor Hindu girl for marriage a...,"PESHAWAR: A local court has rejected the bail plea of a man accused of kidnapping a minor Hindu girl for marriage a few days ago.
However, additional district and sessions judge Abdul Majid granted bail to seven others named in the case as facilitators of the main accused.
An FIR was registered by the East Cantonment police station here on Dec 20 after a Hindu woman, Shakuntla Bibi, formally complained that the prime accused, Ubaid, and others had kidnapped her adopted daughter aged around 15.
The case was registered under the Pakistan Penal Code’s Section 365-B (kidnapping a woman for forced marriage). The police later recovered the girl from Rawalpindi and arrested eight accused.
The complainant had adopted the girl and her brother in 2006 when they were infants.
The prime accused had claimed that the girl had gone with him of her own free will and that he intended to marry her to convert her to Islam.
The girl had also declared in her statement that she wasn’t kidnapped and left home of her own free will.
Shah Faisal Nasapa, lawyer for the complainant, said the girl was a minor child, so her kidnapping for the purpose of marriage was a heinous offence.
He said the girl was aged below 16, so she couldn’t marry under the Child Marriage Restraint Act.
The lawyer insisted that the girl’s statement came under duress as she was under the influence of the accused. He said forcing a minor into marriage was a crime.
The counsel said the accused were named in the FIR, while the minor girl was recovered from their custody.
He said the complainant had adopted the girl and her brother and had been taking care of them for 15 years.
The lawyer for the accused contended that his clients were implicated in a fake case as the girl had never been abducted.
He added that the complainant had adopted the girl and her brother and had been bringing them up as members of the Hindu community.
The counsel contended that his clients were entitled to the concession of bail as they didn’t force the girl to leave her home.

Health secy says committee will work as permanent platform to address grievances of hospitals

A notification said that the competent authority was pleased to notify ‘Hospital Empanelment Grievance Redressal Committee’ including director of independent monitoring unit as its chairman and deputy secretary of administration, deputy chief of health sector reforms unit and deputy secretary (drugs) and deputy director (monitoring and evaluation) of health department to look into the grievances of the hospitals which failed to get empanelled fort the scheme.
The panel has been tasked to review the process of empanelment carried out since July 2021 for free health programme and come up with a comprehensive report.
The health secretary told Dawn that the committee would work as permanent platform for addressing individual cases of grievances referred to it by the department in future.
He said that the panel would holistically review the existing processes and suggest measures for improvement, leading to enhanced transparency. He added that the committee would review the ongoing selection process started since July of the current year but would be a permanent body to look into the standard and quality of all hospitals selected since 2016.
Mr Orakzai said that in case of violation of the selection criteria, strict action would be taken against the hospitals selected for SHPI as well as against the selectors. He said that so far, Rs19.6 billion had been spent on the free treatment of 803,000 patients and more hospitals needed to be empanelled to cater to the health needs of 7.6 million families of the province.
He said that since extension of the programme to the entire province in November last year, there had been manifold increase in number of patients.
“It is big programme and the hospitals want to be enrolled. Some hospitals get approval while others are rejected, therefore, we have formed the committee, which will act as third party to monitor the complaints regarding hospitals as well as other grievances of the people,” said the health secretary.
Other officials said that so far 624 hospitals had been empanelled countrywide that included 158 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. They said that empanelment of hospitals was an ongoing process and recently about 300 health facilities were assessed to designate the ones fulfilling the criteria set forth by the health department.

They said that State Life Insurance Corporation, which was implementing the programme on behalf of the government, was selecting the hospitals but under the agreement, health department could review the process of selection. They added that under the agreement, health department could terminate the contracts with those hospitals that were not operating to a desired level.
“SHPI or Sehat Card Plus has not only benefitting the people but also the enlisted hospitals, which earn from the treatment of patients,” said officials.

7,Panelists for promotion of critical thinking among youth,Experts want ‘hate material’ removed from curriculum,"PESHAWAR: Speakers at a consultation workshop held here on Wednesday emphasised the need for promoting critical thinking among youth by reforming the existing education system.
Lawmakers, academics, journalists, lawyers, and human rights as well as youth activists participated in the two-day consultation on ‘promoting narratives of diversity, inclusion, and peace among youth’ organised by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS), according to a statement issued here.

Experts want ‘hate material’ removed from curriculum 

The speakers argued that the issue of identity crisis had led to extremism and terrorism in the society. Ending poverty, providing alternate spaces for youth, and ensuring rule of law could lead to ending extremist trends among youth, they said.
They underlined that youth didn’t have any awareness about fundamentals of Constitution, and advised them to learn about some key Articles of the Constitution related to fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens.
The panelists said hate material should be removed from the educational curriculum. 
Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif, spokesperson for the provincial government, while taking part in the panel discussion, said extremism and radicalisation were not the issues of one specific country or society. “The present socio-political and socioeconomic system is the cause of extremism in the country,” he said.
He said extremism started when someone wanted to assert his/her identity but didn’t find way to see it developing. “To understand the problems, we will have to understand the identity of individuals,” he said.
Judge Shariah Appellant Bench of the Supreme Court Dr Khalid Masud said there was a war of narratives. He emphasised that narratives used to be particular and contextual and always came from specific segments of society. He stressed, “Diversity comes when we give respect to others’ opinions.”
Dr Syed Hussain Shaheed Soherwordi of the University of Peshawar argued that confusion in the shape of different narratives always impeded promotion of critical thinking. “There is a lack of national integration.” 
MPA Ravi Kumar was of the view that Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government had undertaken a number of initiatives for uplift of youth. He said the provincial government had allocated special funds to train 8,000 young people in information technology sector.

Talking to journalists during a function arranged by Arbab Naseemullah, a leader of QWP, here on Wednesday, he said that future of PTI was bleak and its leaders were unable to face people.
He expressed satisfaction over the performance of the party during the local government elections in some districts of the province.
He said that despite conducting a short campaign, the QWP candidates performed well. However, he expressed annoyance over reports of curtailing powers of elected mayors and councillors by the government. He alleged despite tall claims, the rulers were not serious to devolve powers to grassroots level.
Sikandar Sherpao said that inflation increased manifold due to ‘deal’ of the government with International Monetary Fund (IMF). He alleged that government pushed the country to the verge of bankruptcy. He added that national economy was destroyed.
He said that prices of patrol, diesel, ghee, oil, and other essential items had been increased to a record level. He said that the proposed mini-budget would further depreciate rupee against dollar that might lead to further price hike.
He said that people were suffering owing to the incompetent government of PTI and its wrong policies. He said that people wanted to get rid of the government as it failed on all fronts.
Regarding reports of return of PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif to Pakistan, he said it was his constitutional right to come back and rule the country. He said that government was nervous owing to reports of Nawaz’s return.
The QWP leader said that peace in Afghanistan was vital for peace in Pakistan. He urged government to play its role in improvement of situation in the war-turned neighbouring country. He said that there was contradiction between statements of Prime Minister Imran Khan and Federal Minister Fawad Chaudhry about situation in Afghanistan.

Talking to mediapersons at Zaimdara, he claimed that he joined the party in 1996 and contested the 1997, 2002 and 2008 general elections on the PTI ticket for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly when the party had no support in public. 
Mr Sherin said that he was ignored when the party became popular in 2013. He added that ‘parachuters’ and ‘electables’ were awarded party tickets in 2013 and 2018. 
He said the party leadership and local lawmakers had disappointed the ideological workers for the last eight years. He said the PTI defeat in the first phase of LG polls in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa should serve as an eye-opener for the leadership. He said that scores of more ideological workers like him in Dir had been cornered by the party leadership. 
Mr Sherin demanded Prime Minister Imran Khan to pick ideological workers for the party organisations and award tickets to them in the LG second phase election. 
The PTI activist said the high command should take the ideological workers into confidence before awarding the poll tickets. He demanded of the leadership to award tickets for the tehsil chairman slots on merit. 
SPORTS PROMOTION: The district administration on Wednesday arranged an open kutcheri for resolution of grievances of sports associations and players of different categories. 
Deputy commissioner Aun Haidar Gondal chaired the event that was attended by district sports officer Ibrar Khan, presidents and general secretaries of sports associations and players. 
The participants said the district had a great potential in sports, but unfortunately the players in Dir had no opportunity for displaying their talent. 
The DC said the administration had been in contact with the government for construction of a sports complex in the area. He said construction of a walking and cycling track and sports complex for women were also in the pipeline.
