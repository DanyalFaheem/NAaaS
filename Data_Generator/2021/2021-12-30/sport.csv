0,India in driving seat despite Dean Elgar’s resistance,South Africa are still 211 runs off their record victory target at the venue of 305 on wicket that is treacherous for the batsmen.,"CENTURION: South Africa captain Dean Elgar scored an unbeaten 52 against India as the hosts showed a dogged determination to stay in the fight on a spicy wicket and closed the fourth day on 94 for four in the first Test here at the SuperSport Park on Wednesday.
South Africa are still 211 runs off their record victory target at the venue of 305 on a wicket that is treacherous for the batsmen with sideways movement but also variable bounce.
Some deliveries are staying low and others spitting off the surface with exaggerated bounce.
They will need to negotiate the skilful India attack on the final day as the tourists attempt to secure a victory on the way to a hoped for the first ever series win in South Africa with tests in Johannesburg and Cape Town to follow.
“The wicket has variable bounce so if we keep bowling the right areas then we’re in a good position in the game,” India batting coach Vikram Rathour told reporters.
“If we can carry on doing that tomorrow, I think we will create lot of opportunities ... We need to keep hitting those lengths consistently.”
South Africa lost Aiden Markram (one), Keegan Petersen (17), nightwatchman Keshav Maharaj (eight) and Rassie van der Dussen, who got 11 from 65 balls before being bowled by Jasprit Bumrah (2-22) with a superb in-swinger while not offering a shot.
The highest fourth innings score to win at the SuperSport Park is 251 for eight by England in 2000, an infamous test where both teams agreed to forfeit an innings after rain to force a result.
“We have to show belief,” South Africa fast bowler Kagiso Rabada said.  “We will strategise overnight and work out how we want to approach this.
“Dean has done this countless times, where he shows fight when it is toughest. He will know his job is not over, he is leading from the front.”
India were earlier bowled out for 174 in their second innings, the South African seamers expertly using the conditions with Rabada (4-42) and 21-year-old left-arm debutant Marco Jansen (4-55) the chief wicket takers.
None of the tourists batsmen were able to get settled at the crease with Rishabh Pant (34) the top scorer as he tried to take the attack to the bowlers.
There was more disappointment for India captain Virat Kohli (18) as he chased a wide delivery for the second time in the test and was caught by wicket-keeper Quinton de Kock off the bowling of Jansen.

1,Chris Woakes backs Joe Root to remain captain despite Ashes failure,"""Joe is a great cricketer, he’s got a great cricket brain. I think his record as England captain is pretty good,"" says Woakes.","LONDON: England all-rounder Chris Woakes has supported Joe Root to continue as the team’s Test skipper despite their humiliating Ashes capitulation to Australia.
England suffered an innings and 14-run loss to Australia on Tuesday in Melbourne as Root’s team surrendered the five-Test Ashes series with two Tests to spare.
Root, who was reluctant to discuss the long-term future of his captaincy after the Ashes defeat in the third Test, has not won any of his three Ashes series in charge.
The 30-year-old has also suffered a record nine defeats in 2021 as the captain.
Asked if the England team would support Root’s continuation as skipper, Woakes told British media on Wednesday,  “Absolutely.
“It’s clear that the captaincy isn’t having an effect on his batting, which a lot of the time with captains can be the case.”
Root has proved a virtual lone hand with the bat and, after scoring 50 and 28 in Melbourne, he finishes the calendar year with 1,708 runs -- the third-highest after Mohammad Yousuf (1,788) and Viv Richards (1,710).
“The fact that he’s scoring the runs he is, is great for the team,” Woakes added.  “It would be great if we could help him out with that and build some partnerships with him, and score a few more runs around him.
“But Joe is a great cricketer, he’s got a great cricket brain. I think his record as England captain is pretty good, as far as I’m aware. I definitely feel like Joe will continue.”
Asked if coach Chris Silverwood also has the same support, Woakes added:  “Who am I to talk about people’s futures other than my own, to be brutally honest? We have two more games and we want to show a lot of character, a lot of fight.
“The group of players, the management and the staff we have out here have the backing of the players to hopefully put things right, over the next two games in particular.”
British media reported that the England board’s chief executive Tom Harrison met Root in Melbourne on Wednesday to discuss the reasons behind the failing tour but the board is said to be supportive of him staying on as captain.

2,"More Real, Barca players test positive for Covid-19",Several other Spanish clubs have reported Covid cases but no match has yet been postponed.,"BARCELONA: Four more Real Madrid players, and three from Barcelona, have tested positive for Covid-19, the two clubs said Wednesday as new infections hit record highs in Spain.
Real Madrid’s Belgian keeper Thibaut Courtois, 
Uruguay midfielder Federico Valverde, French midfielder Eduardo Camavinga and Brazilian winger Vincius Junior are all infected, the La Liga leaders said in a statement.
A spokeswoman for the club declined to say how many players are currently infected with the virus but since mid-December eight other players have tested positive including Gareth Bale and Luka Modric.
Meanwhile Barca said its forward Ousmane Dembele, defender Samuel Umtiti and midfielder Gavi have tested positive for Covid-19.
“The players are in good health and self-isolating at home. The Club has reported the cases to the relevant authorities,” it said in a statement.
The three players join left-back Jordi Alba, centre-back Clement Lenglent and defender Dani Alves, who also tested positive this week.
Barca, currently seventh in La Liga, travel to Real Mallorca (15th) on Sunday.
Several other Spanish clubs, including Cadiz, Real Sociedad and RCD Mallorca, have reported Covid cases but no match has yet been postponed.
Under Liga protocols, a club must have at least 13 players, at least five of them first-teamers and one a goalkeeper, available to play a match.
Vaccinated players can return as soon as they test negative.
This puts Sunday’s match between Atletico Madrid and Rayo Vallecano at risk because the latter team has up to 17 infected players, according to press reports, making it the hardest-hit squad in the first division.
Spain on Tuesday confirmed a record 99,671 new infections in the last 24 hours, bringing the 14-day infection rate to 1,360 cases per 100,000 residents, nearly twice the level from a week earlier.

The federation had already cancelled one of the three scheduled matches, but had hoped to play the remaining two on Wednesday and Thursday.
“While all players in both current playing squads have returned negative Covid results overnight, two members of the Irish support staff have tested positive, as well as several partners of players, resulting in two of the Irish players being deemed as ‘close contacts,’” USA Cricket said in a statement.
The latest Covid concerns — following positive tests for an umpire and members of the US squad —  “meant 
that both boards have regrettably agreed to cancel the remaining two scheduled matches.”
The US and Ireland each won a T20 International in the opening two games of Ireland’s tour.
The Irish touring party are scheduled to leave Florida for Kingston, Jamaica, on Friday for their series against the West Indies. The two support staff members who tested positive will remain in isolation in Florida before they travel.

4,Warner eyes one more crack at England in 2023,MELBOURNE: David Warner has hinted he is keen for one last Ashes tour in 2023 to make amends for his failed campaign...,"MELBOURNE: David Warner has hinted he is keen for one last Ashes tour in 2023 to make amends for his failed campaign in England two years ago, drawing inspiration from veteran seamer Jimmy Anderson.
The explosive Australian opener would be approaching 37 should he retain his place that long and in all likelihood would have joined the 100-Test club.
He currently has 89 caps.
Winning in India is also on his bucket list before pulling up stumps on a Test career that has so far yielded 7,551 runs at 48.40.
“Winning the Ashes here was obviously a big one,” Warner said after Australia crushed England in the third Test in Melbourne to retain the Ashes.
“We still haven’t beaten India in India, that would be nice to do.
“And England away -- we had a drawn series [in 2019] but hopefully if I manage to get that opportunity, I might think about going back.”
England hasn’t been a happy hunting ground for Warner, who had a horror tour in 2019, when he managed just 95 runs at 9.50 from five Tests with Stuart Broad dismissing him seven times.
“In terms of 2019 it was obviously in England so he [Broad] was able to get the ball to come back into us and away from us,” said Warner, who has been a mainstay at the top of the Australian order for a decade.
“For me it was one of those tours where I didn’t back my game plan and I went too defensive and I didn’t attack. That was my fault, and he bowled really well.”
Whether Warner can still be competitive into 2023 remains to be seen, although he has been written off previously and come roaring back, most recently at the Twenty20 World Cup.
He was dropped by his Indian Premier League team Sunrisers Hyderabad ahead of the World Cup, leading some pundits to suggest his best days were over.
But Warner responded in the only way he knows, by scoring runs, and was named player of the tournament as Australia lifted the trophy.
He pointed to England’s Anderson, still going strong at 39, as an example of cricketers performing at their peak well into the twilight of their careers.
“James Anderson sets the benchmark for older guys these days, we look up to him getting on in our days,” Warner said after Anderson bowled beautifully in the Melbourne Test.
“For me it’s just about performing to the best of my ability and putting runs on the board.”

5,Sajid Khan spins KP to second successive Quaid-e-Azam Trophy title,He took the final five Northern wickets on the last day of the final which saw 15 wickets tumble as KP won by 169 runs.,"KARACHI: Midway through their second innings, it had become pretty evident Northern were playing for a draw and some pride in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy final. 
With defending champions Khyber Pakhtunkhwa already having the first innings lead that would’ve given them a title in case of a stalemate and Northern still requiring 228 runs for victory with five wickets remaining, the latter knew a win was an improbable proposition. 
A draw at the National Stadium, if they played out the overs in the final session, would’ve been a fighting one for Northen, who were the best team in the round-robin stage. 
But Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had Pakistan Test spinner Sajid Khan in their ranks. 
And he ensured Khyber Pakhtunkhwa won the title in style having shared the title with Central Punjab last season after their final had ended in a thrilling tie. 
Sajid (5-32) took the final five Northern wickets on the last day of the final which saw 15 wickets tumble as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa won by 169 runs. 
“It’s a proud moment as it is fifth trophy for us,” Khyber Pakhtunkhwa captain Iftikhar Ahmed said, referring to their other titles in the National Twenty20 Cup (2) and the Pakistan Cup in the last three seasons since the new region-based domestic system came in place. 
Chasing 384 for victory, Northern folded for 214 with opener Mohammad Huraira (57) and middle-order batter Farhan Riaz (49) offering some resistance. They had earlier dismissed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for 265 in their second innings with Rehan Afridi’s 79 being the highlight. 
Rehan was on 42 with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on 152-5 when play started on Wednesday and his runs provided the base for his side to set a daunting target for Northern. 
After his fellow overnight batsman Iftikhar (25) was lbw to Mohammad Musa (3-71), Rehan combined with Sajid (39) to add 58 runs before he pulled Kashif Ali to Waqas Ahmed at fine leg. He hit eight boundaries and a six in his knock. 
Sajid hit two sixes and as many fours, adding another 28 runs with Mohammad Wasim Jr (11) before both fell in the similar fashion in the same over by Mohammad Nawaz (4-65), edging a turning ball to Mubasir Khan at slip. 
Imran Khan added a quick 16 as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s tail continued to wag before Nawaz ended their innings when he had Sameen Gul stumped. 
Northern knew they had to get the runs quickly and came racing out of the blocks. 
Opener Haider Ali struck four boundaries in his 17 off nine deliveries but gave Sahibzada Farhan a straightforward catch at third slip as he tried to guide an Imran delivery down to third man. 
Huraira, the teenage sensation who finished as this season’s top-run getter in his debut season with 986 runs, kept up the scoring rate as he struck six fours his 49-ball knock with Northern bringing up their 100 runs in the 13th over. 
But he fell soon after, trying to hit Iftikhar out of the park but only finding long-off. 
“It would’ve been an even better feeling if we’d won the match,” Huraira said after being awarded the award for the best batter. 
Skipper Umar Amin, who had been more sedate by comparison — hitting three fours in 33 off 40 deliveries, fell in similar fashion trying to hit a six off Iftikhar as Northern slipped from 105-1 to 113-3. 
Nawaz added a quick 26 with four hits to the fence before he was the fourth batter to fall, giving Wasim a return catch off a short ball. 
Wasim then had Rohail Nazir (7) caught behind soon after and Northern’s hopes of snatching a victory had all but evaporated. Their hitting had turned into blocking and they needed their remaining batters to stick with Farhan. 
Sarmad Bhatti (4) couldn’t do that, with Nawaz bowling him round his legs and Farhan fell lbw to Nawaz with the score at 205. He hit four boundaries in his 77-ball vigil. 
Sajid then dismissed Mohammad Musa (4) and Waqas Ahmed (0) in the space of three deliveries before sealing victory for his side when player of the tournament Mubasir could only chip his delivery to Iftikhar at short mid-wicket. 
It was time to celebrate. Sajid looked up to the skies, his team-mates taking the stumps before he joined them as they danced in a huddle.

6,Black Jack wins line honours in Sydney-Hobart race,HOBART: Black Jack beat LawConnect and SHK Scallywag to claim line honours in the Sydney Hobart yacht race in the...,"HOBART: Black Jack beat LawConnect and SHK Scallywag to claim line honours in the Sydney Hobart yacht race in the early hours of Wednesday morning after battling some of the toughest conditions in the event’s recent history. 
The three 100-footers were involved in an intense tussle for the lead before SHK Scallywag encountered problems, leaving Black Jack and LawConnect to fight it out for victory. 
Black Jack, skippered by Mark Bradford, took a six nautical-mile (11.1-km) lead over LawConnect on Tuesday morning and crossed the finish line in Hobart at 1:37 am local time (1427 GMT, Tuesday). 
“It’s a nervous wait. I’ve never felt this feeling before. It’s strange because I’ve always been on the boat when its racing and you keep busy. You don’t think about it the way you do when you’re ashore waiting,” said Black Jack owner Peter Harburg before the finish. 
Black Jack previously claimed line honors in the 2009 edition under the name Alfa Romeo. It was second to Wild Oats XI by just 28 minutes in a 2018 thriller. 
Weather wreaked havoc throughout the 628 nautical-mile (1,170-km) course as heavy winds of up to 30 knots forced more than a third of the 88 entrants to retire from the race, which was among the slowest in the competition’s history. 
Last year’s edition of the race was cancelled due to Covid-19.

9,Liverpool stunned as Lookman lifts Leicester,LONDON: Juergen Klopp admitted Liverpool had only themselves to blame for their shock 1-0 defeat at Leicester as...,"LONDON: Juergen Klopp admitted Liverpool had only themselves to blame for their shock 1-0 defeat at Leicester as Mohamed Salah’s penalty miss and Ademola Lookman’s winner dented the Reds’ title challenge on Tuesday.
Klopp’s side saw their 10-match unbeaten run in all competitions ended by Lookman’s second half strike.
Liverpool trail leaders Manchester City by six points, with the champions playing at Brentford on Wednesday.
Beaten for the first time since their 3-2 loss at West Ham in November, second placed Liverpool paid the price for missed chances.
Crucially, Kasper Schmeichel saved Salah’s first half penalty as Liverpool failed to score in the league for the first time since March.
“We were just not good enough. We still had enough chances. What we did with the ball was just not right. We played a really bad game,” Klopp said.
“We should have defended better. We do that usually, why we didn’t do it today is hard to explain. There were so many performances below the normal level.” Liverpool’s flop against Covid and injury ravaged Leicester, who were hammered 6-3 by City on Sunday, puts extra pressure on them to take maximum points at title rivals Chelsea in their first game of 2022 on Sunday.
“It’s a big gap. In this moment it is not my problem. If we play our normal football, Liverpool football, we have the chance to win more games,” Klopp said.
“The first thing is not to do it ever again like this. We lost our rhythm and weren’t calm enough to get it back. That is our fault.” 
Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers added:  “It’s an absolutely heroic performance. An amazing result for us with everything we’re going through against one of the best teams in the world.” 
Liverpool had more rest than Leicester over Christmas after a Leeds Covid outbreak forced the postponement of their game on Sunday.
Back in action only 48 hours after their thrashing at City, Leicester were unable to field a recognised centre-back for a rematch of the League Cup quarter-final won by Liverpool on penalties last week.
Liverpool, bolstered by Virgil van Dijk’s return from Covid, looked set to take advantage of Leicester’s makeshift line-up in the early stages.
Salah had a golden opportunity to open the scoring in the 16th minute after his burst through the Leicester defence was halted by Wilfred Ndidi’s trip.
But Salah failed to score a Liverpool penalty for only the third time as Schmeichel saved his unconvincing effort before the Egyptian headed the rebound against the bar.
Schmeichel made a host of fine saves to keep Liverpool at bay before Sadio Mane was guilty of a shocking miss when he sprinted through the heart of the Leicester defence, only to blaze over.
Klopp held his head in frustration and the German had even more reason to rue Liverpool’s profligacy in the 59th minute.
Three minutes after coming off the bench, former Everton forward Lookman took Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall’s pass, danced past Joel Matip and forced Van Dijk to back off as he planted a fine finish past Alisson Becker from 10 yards.
Elsewhere on Tuesday, Tottenham were held to a 1-1 draw at 10-man Southampton.
Southampton took a deserved lead in the 25th minute with a stunning strike from James Ward-Prowse.
The game was turned on its head when Mohammed Salisu brought down Son Heung-min in the penalty area shortly before half-time.
Salisu was sent off for a second yellow card and Harry Kane made no mistake from the spot.
In the second half, Kane saw a goal controversially disallowed by VAR for offside.
“Yeah, I think Harry scored twice, one a penalty and then the second goal.
I think that I don’t want to comment on the referee decision or the VAR decision,” Conte said.
Fifth placed West Ham won 4-1 at lowly Watford to bolster their top four bid, while Crystal Palace defeated bottom side Norwich 3-0 at Selhurst Park.

There has been intense speculation over Djokovic’s participation in both events, with the 34-year-old, who is opposed to Covid-19 vaccinations, repeatedly declining to say if he has been inoculated against the virus.
Organisers of the Australian Open, which starts on Jan 17, have stipulated that all participants must be vaccinated against the coronavirus or have a medical exemption granted by an independent panel of experts.
“Novak Djokovic has officially withdrawn from the ATP Cup in Sydney, we have no update as yet on his plans for the Australian Open,” a Tennis Australia spokeswoman said in an emailed statement.

The global men’s tennis governing body ATP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
ATP Cup organisers said Serbia’s team would now be led by world number 33 Dusan Lajovic.
Owing to Djokovic’s current world ranking, Serbia received top billing for the 16-team event, which runs from Jan 1-9, and have been drawn in Group A along with Norway, Chile and Spain.
Djokovic has won a record nine Australian Open titles, including the last three, and is in a three-way tie on 20 major titles with Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal in the all-time list.
His father Srdjan told a Serbian television channel last month that Djokovic would probably pull out of the major, saying Tennis Australia’s stance on mandatory vaccination was tantamount to  “blackmail”.
The season-opening ATP Cup also saw Austria, which failed the eligibility criteria following the withdrawal of Dominic Thiem and Dennis Novak, replaced by France.
Russia, which won the 2021 title, will be missing Andrey Rublev and Aslan Karatsev from that team.
