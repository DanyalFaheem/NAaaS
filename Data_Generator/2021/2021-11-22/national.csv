0,Urdu’s Dakani variety and its dictionaries,"Deccan or Dakan, also spelt Dakkan and Dakhan, literally means south. The region lies in southern parts of the...","Deccan or Dakan, also spelt Dakkan and Dakhan, literally means south. The region lies in southern parts of the Indo-Pak subcontinent, hence the name. As opposed to Deccan, the north is called uttar or uttara, as in Uttar Pradesh (pradesh means region or province).  
Some experts say Dakani, or Deccani, the local variety of Urdu developed and spoken in Deccan, is a dialect of Urdu. Others believe it is a regional variety of Urdu. The Dakani variety of Urdu has numerous words that originally came from local languages spoken in the south and they are, mostly, Dravidian languages while Urdu is an Indo-Aryan language. But Dakani has some peculiar grammatical rules, too. For instance, one way of forming plurals in Dakani is to add aan at the end of a noun and raataan and baataan are simply plural of Urdu raat (night) and baat (talk or conversation), respectively, though correct the Urdu usage would be raaten and baaten.  
Secondly, Sanskrit, Gujarati, Punjabi and Marathi have influenced Dakani to a large extent. But Dakani’s basic grammar and vocabulary is based on Urdu, spoken in the north. So Dakani is just a regional variety of Urdu spoken in the northern India and it travelled from north to south with conquerors, traders and Muslim Sufis and preachers. Strangely enough, though Urdu was born in north, the earliest pieces of Urdu literature were penned in south (Deccan). 
But Dakani has some peculiarities that pose difficulties to those not familiar with it, which inspired some scholars to compile separate dictionaries of Dakani Urdu. Here is a brief introduction to the dictionaries of Dakani published so far: 
Farhang-e-Usmania (1929) 
This is a 318-page specialised dictionary and gives terminology used in official correspondence in state of Deccan, as Deccan’s official language was Urdu — that is, till India annexed state of Deccan by force in 1948. Naseeruddin Hashmi in his Dakan Mein Urdu has written that Urdu was made state of Deccan’s official language in 1884. Compiled by Mir Lutf Ali Qazi Arif Abul ‘Alai and published from Hyderabad (Deccan) in 1929, it also includes some general Urdu words used in Deccan.  
Dakan Ki Zaban (1935) 
This dictionary of Dakani, too, was compiled by Mir Lutf Ali Qazi Arif Abul ‘Alai. It was planned to record 100,000 words and was to be published in 30 volumes, but only first volume, consisting of 48 pages, could be published. 
Dakani Lughat 
A pocket dictionary of Dakani having just 104 pages, it was compiled by Syed Shi’aar Ahmed Shi’aar Hashmi. Dakani Lughat does not show the year of publication. But it was published, probably, prior to 1947, as the introduction by Abdullah Imadi shows (Imadi was a scholar who died in 1947). The interesting aspect is that it carries some slangy expressions that are rarely found in standard Urdu dictionaries, such as apan (we, us) and chillar (small money, change, coins).  
Dakani Urdu Ki Lughat (1969) 
Compiled by Dr Masood Husain Khan and Ghulam Umer Khan, this was the first-ever comprehensive and reliable Dakani dictionary.  
First published in 1969, the dictionary cites explanatory quotations from published and unpublished works of Dakani literature, to authenticate the meaning and usage.  
Dakani Lughaat (1970) 
Compiled by Muhammad Sibghatullah and Syed Abu Turaab Khataai Zamin, it comprises of 152 pages and has an introduction describing the history of Dakani literature. 
Dakani Farhang (1972)  
Compiled by Ameer Arifi, it is basically a glossary of Urdu masnavis written in Deccan and includes vocabulary from famous masnavis, namely, ‘Qutb Mushtari’, ‘Man Lagan’, ‘Tooti Nama’, ‘Gulshan-e-Ishq’ and ‘Saif-ul-mulook-o- Bad’ee-ul-Jamal’.  
Qadeem Urdu Ki Lughat (1973) 
Though not intended to be read as a dictionary of Dakani, this work by Jameel Jalibi includes words from Urdu’s classical and early literature, naturally making it a partial dictionary of Dakani as well, since Urdu literature’s earliest works were penned in Deccan. 
Behr-ul-Ma’ani (1987) 
Compiled by Javed Vashisht and subtitled Dakani Urdu Ka Lughat, the 700-page work mentions Dakani’s literary works from where the words have been picked. But some scholars have expressed their doubts about authenticity of this work. 
Dakani Lughat-o-Tazkira-e-Dakani Makhtootaat (2002)  
Prof Agha Hyder Hasan Mirza (1892-1976) was a scholar, poet and an incurable collector of rare manuscripts, rare books, antiques and paintings. He had begun writing a dictionary of Dakani and a descriptive catalogue of Dakani Urdu’s manuscript, many of which were part of his invaluable collection. But he could not finish it and Mughni Tabassum had to edit it. This scholarly work was finally published in book form in 2002. 
Dakani Lughat (2008) 
Compiled by a renowned scholar of Dakani like Dr Syeda Jafer, this is, perhaps, the most comprehensive and most authentic when compared with similar works. Explanatory quotations from classical literary texts and a brief but erudite preface make it even more valuable.

1,Rally held in Gwadar in support of rights,Rally's leader asks elected representatives of Gwadar and Makran to either join the sit-in or resign from the assembly.,"GWADAR: Hundreds of children took to the streets on Sunday in solidarity with the people of Gwadar who are staging a sit-in in the port city for one week for basic rights. 
Carrying placards and banners inscribed with demands “Gwadar ko haq do”, the children marched on various roads of the city and later joined the main sit-in. 
Speaking on the occasion, Maulana Hidayat Ullah Baloch, who led the rally, criticised the elected representatives of Gwadar and Makran and asked them to join the sit-in or resign from the assembly as they had been elected to represent them. 
He said the names of the representatives who did not visit their constituency should be included in list of missing persons. 
Maulana Baloch said that despite the deployment of various security agencies, hundreds of illegal trawlers were involved in illegal fishing in Balochistan’s waters, depriving local fishermen of their livelihood. 
He asked the authorities concerned to take steps for stopping illegal fishing immediately and seal all liquor stores in the province. “Otherwise people will destroy them.” 
He called for recovery of all disappeared people and said if they were involved in any crime they must be produced before a court of law.  
“If our demands are not met, we will continue the sit-in for 127 days in order to break the record of Imran Khan who staged his sit-in for 126 days,” Maulana Baloch said.

5,Saad Rizvi urges people to vote for TLP in next polls,Says his followers are ready to sacrifice more lives if someone challenges them.,"LAHORE: Chief of the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) Hafiz Saad Rizvi has declared he would lay down his life but would not surrender to any oppressor, and urged the people to vote for his organisation in the next general elections. 
He was addressing an event termed the Shuhada-i-Namoos-i-Risalat Conf­e­rence on Sunday. Hundreds of people who had come to attend the concluding ceremony of the three-day Urs of Kha­dim Hussain Rizvi were in attendance. 
Hafiz Rizvi was released from Kot Lakhpat jail on Thursday after an agreement with the government. The two sides reached an understanding after many rounds of talks and two weeks of clashes which left seven policemen and an unspecified number of TLP workers dead. 

Says his followers are ready to sacrifice more lives if someone challenges them

Speaking on the occasion, the TLP chief said those who were astonished over the turn of events did not know who won the “battle”. “Our mothers, dead and injured, have won the ground because they didn’t step back while sacrificing their lives and property,” he added. 
He said his followers had shown the world that they would not step back and their mothers had not given birth to cowards. “Now my followers are asking what they will have to do in the 2023 elections after sacrificing the lives of their loved ones and property,” he said. 
He said all his comrades and followers stood for the respect and dignity of Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) as the nation trusted them to protect the finality of his prophethood. “Now I demand from the nation that their ballot boxes should not remain empty during the next elections.” 
Hafiz Rizvi thanked former chairman of the Central Ruet-i-Hilal Commi­ttee Mufti Muneeb-ur-Rehman and all others who played a role in facilitating an agreement with the government. He practically saluted Mufti Muneeb before the people attending the concluding ceremony of his father’s Urs. 
He went on to tell the audience that they should continue their struggle. “People who don’t have an ideology are useless and it would be like saying a nuclear bomb possessed by a weak nation would be of no use,” he said. 
He declared that his organisation did not lose anything even after sacrificing the lives of several people and they were ready to do it again if anyone dared challenge them. 
TLP’s naib emir Peer Syed Zaheerul Hassan Shah, and its central executive members Dr Muhammad Shafiq Ameeni and Mufti Umair-ul-Zahrvi were among those who also spoke at the conference.

6,Indian minister’s remarks rejected,"ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office has strongly rejected a highly irresponsible, provocative and gratuitous statement by...","ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office has strongly rejected a highly irresponsible, provocative and gratuitous statement by the Indian defence minister threatening Pakistan and said his unfounded remarks are delusional and reflective of India’s characteristic hostility towards its neighbours.
“India’s smear campaign against Pakistan has been totally exposed and discredited. It has no takers in the international community,” the FO said in a statement on Sunday.
“It is no secret that Indian leaders engage in falsehoods and fantasies while pointing fingers at neighbours, including Pakistan. In doing so India wants to divert the attention of the international community from the widespread violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed by the Indian occupation forces in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK),” it added.
The FO said Pakistan was fully capable of defending itself against any aggression, adding the entire world was witness to Pakistan’s capability and resolve in thwarting the Indian misadventure in February 2019.
“It is a well-documented fact that Indian occupation forces have been committing egregious human rights violations and grave crimes against innocent Kashmiris in IIOJK, including extra-judicial killings, custodial deaths, torture, arbitrary detentions, using people including innocent children as human shield, and collective punishment by demolishing homes,” it added.
The FO said the dossier presented by Pakistan to the international community in September 2021 contained incontrovertible evidence of gross and systematic human rights violations and crimes against humanity by Indian occupation forces in IIOJK.
“Indian government’s frustration is evident from the fact that despite its unabated state terrorism in IIOJK, it has utterly failed to silence the peaceful voices of Kashmiris demanding their right to self-determination promised to them by the United Nations Security Council in its various resolutions.
“While fully prepared to respond to India’s provocations and irresponsible behaviour, Pakistan will continue to act responsibly and contribute to all efforts for promoting peace, security and stability in the region and beyond,” said the statement. 
According to media reports, Indian Defe­nce Minister Rajnath Singh had on Saturday said that nothing would deter India from crossing over into Pakistan’s territory and conduct airstrikes.

No ...","QUETTA: Three workers were shot dead at a coal mine in the Shahrag area of Harnai district on Sunday morning.
No one claimed responsibility for the attack. 
“Armed men suddenly appeared at the coal mine site and opened indiscriminate fire with automatic weapons,” a senior official of the Levies Force said, adding that all the three miners died on the spot. “It seems to be a target killing to create terror,” he said. 
Security forces rushed to the site soon after receiving information about the incident and shifted the bodies to a nearby health facility.
Officials said that all the three victims were Afghan nationals and residents of Kandahar. 
“The deceased miners have not been identified so far,” said Sohail Anwar Hashmi, the deputy commissioner of Harnai district. 
Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo and Home Minister Mir Ziaullah Langove strongly condemned the killings and termed the incident a terrorist act. They said those involved in this barbarian act would be brought to justice, they stressed.

8,MWM opposes ‘secret’ talks with TTP,Party chief says victims should be taken into confidence.,"ISLAMABAD: The Majlis Wahdatul Muslimeen (MWM) has opposed the reported secret talks between the state and the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), asking which institution is representing the state in the talks and what the banned group has promised to do in return if the government reaches an agreement with it. 
Speaking to the media here on Sunday, MWM secretary general Allama Nasir Abbas said that the TTP had itself taken responsibility for killing thousands of innocent citizens of the country. The relatives of the victims have a right to ask on what ground the government is holding negotiations with such a dangerous group, he added. 
He said the talks between the government and the TTP must be clear and transparent and there should be no secrecy in them. The TTP has massacred not only innocent citizens, but also members of armed forces, police and political parties.

Party chief says victims should be taken into confidence 

He said the government must take parliament and provincial assemblies into confidence before initiating any kind of parleys with the TTP. Those who are representing the government in the talks with the terrorist group should brief a committee comprising members of the National Assembly and Senate, he added.
Without naming any government’s agency, Allama Abbas said it should not be up to any single institution to initiate a closed-door discussion with the TTP. Besides, he added, there are some basic questions which must be answered before starting talks with the terrorist group. “Has the TTP recognised the state of Pakistan? Do they repent for their past deeds? Is the TTP ready to pledge not to take up arms against the state or the citizens of Pakistan? And most importantly, will they pay diyat (financial compensation paid to heirs of a victim) to the families of those whom they have killed or seek an apology from them?” 
The MWM is a close political ally of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and the first political party to have joined the PTI’s Azadi March and sit-in against the government of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif in 2014. The MWM also shares cabinet positions with the PTI government in Gilgit-Baltistan.
Allama Abbas claimed that the TTP had killed around 80,000 Pakistanis, saying that 30,000 of them belonged to the Shia community. All those groups or political parties, including the Awami National Party, which had become victims of the TTP’s brutality must be taken into confidence before the start of talks with the banned terrorist group, he added. 
He lauded the recent Sindh Assembly’s resolution which had expressed concern over the ongoing negotiations with the TTP. The resolution demanded that the federal government take all relevant stakeholders on board before making such a decision. The resolution also demanded involvement of political parties and other institutions in these talks. 
Allama Abbas expressed the fear that the government might end up yielding not much from the terrorist group and agreeing to give it much more in turn, including release of its hardcore terrorists from jail.
