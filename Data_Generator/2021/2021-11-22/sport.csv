0,Solskjaer’s legendary status fails to prevent United sacking,"“Ole will always be a legend at Manchester United and it is with regret that we've reached this difficult decision,” United says.","LONDON: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s firing by Manchester United on Sunday underscored the oddity of his appointment three years ago and flaws in the club’s determination to persevere so long with a manager whose credentials were constantly doubted as a vast investment in players made little significant impact on the pitch. 
Even after chastening losses to fierce rivals Liverpool and Manchester City in the last month, United stuck by Solskjaer. 
While Aston Villa and Norwich used the two-week international break to fire and bring in new managers, United’s leadership waited until after Saturday’s 4-1 collapse at Watford a fifth loss in seven Premier League games to finally decide change was required in the dugout. 
“Ole will always be a legend at Manchester United and it is with regret that we have reached this difficult decision,” United said in a statement. 
It was only Solskjaer’s legendary status that got him the job in the first place as Jose Mourinho’s successor and kept him in post for so long without winning a trophy. 
There was only so much that fondness for scoring the dramatic late winner in the 1999 Champions League final could insulate the Norwegian from criticism that saw his future hang in the balance so often. The three-year contract extension awarded to Solskjaer ahead of the season by the club’s owners, the Glazer family, has now been terminated. 
“While the past few weeks have been disappointing, they should not obscure all the work he has done over the past three years to rebuild the foundations for long-term success,” United said. 
Former player Michael Carrick, a member of Solskjaer’s coaching staff, will take charge of the United team for Tuesday’s Champions League match away to Villarreal with the club saying they will then look to appoint an interim manager to lead the side until the end of the season. 
Bookmakers have installed former Real Madrid coach and France midfielder Zinedine Zidane as favourite to be the next permanent manager of the club. 
Solskjaer had been able to ride out previous stretches of underperformance, in part because of his popularity with fans as a former striker who took on legendary status because of his ability to come off the bench to score crucial winners. 
But even the traveling United fans seemed to turn against him when he came over to applaud them after the Watford game when Donny van de Beek, a player he rarely used to much astonishment, scored the only goal after coming on as a substitute. 
And there was a damning final critique from goalkeeper David De Gea whose double penalty save from Watford’s Ismaila Sarr counted for nothing with United dropping to seventh place in the standings, 12 points adrift of leaders Chelsea. 
“We don’t know what to do with the ball,” he said. “We don’t’ know how to defend properly. It was embarrassing. It’s not acceptable for this club and the level of players that we have. It’s another nightmare.” 
STYLISH CITY CLOSE ON CHELSEA 
In Sunday’s action, Manchester City moved back to second, within three points of Chelsea, after a stylish 3-0 win over Everton at the Etihad Stadium. 
Raheem Sterling put City ahead, a minute before the break, side-footing home after a magnificent ball, struck with the outside of his foot, by full back Joao Cancelo. 
Rodri made it 2-0 with a thundering long-distance strike that whistled past Everton keeper Jordan Pickford in the 55th minute as 11th-placed Everton, without the presence of Dominic Calvert-Lewin up front, rarely threatened. 
Bernardo Silva completed a routine victory in the 86th by slotting home from close range after Cole Palme had a shot blocked. 
Chelsea lead the table on 29 points, with City three points behind and Liverpool one further back in third after dismantling Arsenal 4-0 at Anfield on Saturday. 
A resurgent Arsenal side had the chance to climb above Liverpool in the standings with a win, but Juergen Klopp’s side gave the visitors a reminder that there is still a big gulf in class between the teams. 
Sadio Mane scored the opener in the first half and Liverpool then dismantled Mikel Arteta’s side after the break, with Diogo Jota, Mohamed Salah and substitute Takumi Minamino running up the scoreline. 
Fourth-placed West Ham United missed the chance to move into second as Raul Jimenez scored the only goal in a 1-0 win for Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux. Wolves moved to sixth, one point behind Arsenal. 
Elsewhere on Saturday, former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard started his reign as Aston Villa manager with a 2-0 win over Brighton and Hove Albion, while his predecessor Dean Smith saw his new team Norwich City climb out of last place with a 2-1 home win against Southampton. 
Newcastle United hit the bottom as they remained winless after 12 games following a 3-3 home draw with Brentford. 
Burnley remain in the bottom three after another six-goal thriller at Turf Moor ended 3-3 with Crystal Palace.

The incident occurred during the third over of Bangladesh’s innings, when Shaheen fielded the ball on his follow through and threw it at Afif, hitting him on the foot.
The batsman was within the popping crease and not intending to take a run.
The International Cricket Council said Shaheen had breached a rule against throwing objects in an inappropriate or dangerous manner.
“Shaheen admitted the offence and accepted the sanction,” the statement said.  “There was no need for a formal hearing.”
Local media published photos of Shaheen shaking hands with Afif after the match.
Pakistan lead the three-match series 2-0 after winning the first two Dhaka encounters by four and eight wickets.
The third match of the series will be held on Monday at the same ground.
Bangladesh have listed pace bowler Kamrul Islam Rabbi and opening batsman Parvez Hossain as injury covers for Shoriful Islam and Mustafizur Rahman.

The Mercedes seven-time champion held off his arch Dutch rival’s Red  Bull by a country mile under the Losail circuit’s lights to leave the  battle for the F1 drivers’ crown delicately poised with only two races remaining.
Fernando Alonso took third for Alpine, the former two-time world  champion’s first podium since 2014, the grizzled 40-year-old getting a  huge cheer from the crowd.
Hamilton, who also won last week in Brazil, has trimmed 17 points  from Verstappen’s lead in the title race in a week. Verstappen still  holds an eight-point lead with two races remaining in one of the most  dramatic F1 title fights in at least a decade.
“We needed those points today. I can’t wait to watch the race replay to  find out what happened behind me,” he said after his 102nd career win. 
“I’m really grateful for these points, it’s been a hell of a year. Back-to-back wins, feels good, I feel fit, fitter than I’ve ever felt. Bring on the next two!”
Verstappen finished second for Red Bull, nearly 25 seconds behind Hamilton.
Verstappen was hit with a penalty before the race even began when  he was dropped five spots on the starting grid for violating a yellow  flag in Saturday’s qualifying. The Dutchman had qualified second but the  stewards ordered him to drop back on the grid.
Bottas, who had qualified third, was penalized three  starting spots. 
Despite the penalty,  Verstappen needed only five laps to recover and drove back to where he  was originally positioned to start.
“Our starting position was a bit compromised,” Verstappen said. “I  know it’s going to be difficult to the end but I think that’s nice. It  keeps it exciting.”
But he said he was ready for the challenges ahead in Saudi Arabia and the finale in Abu Dhabi. 
Hamilton, winner of four straight titles, has all the momentum now. The British driver is seeking a record eighth F1 title, which would move him past Michael Schumacher.
Sergio Perez finished fourth to help Red Bull in its push to beat Mercedes for the constructors championship.

3,India sweep T20 series against New Zealand to kick off Dravid era,Captain Rohit Sharma smashed 56 off 31 balls to fire the hosts to a strong 184-7 in the dead rubber at Eden Gardens.,"KOLKATA: India romped to a 73-run victory over New Zealand in their third and final Twenty20 International in Kolkata on Sunday as head coach Rahul Dravid began his tenure with a 3-0 series sweep.
Home captain Rohit Sharma smashed 56 off 31 balls to fire the hosts to a strong 184-7 in the dead rubber at Eden Gardens.
Martin Guptill made a breezy 51 but New Zealand, runners-up at the recent Twenty20 World Cup, were all out for 111 in the 18th over.
“It’s nice to start well,” Dravid, who inherited the coaching reins from Ravi Shastri after the World Cup, told the official broadcasters. “But we have to be realistic about this win and keep our feet on the ground. It’s been really good to see some of the younger guys come through.”
Opting to bat, India plundered 69 runs off the first six overs and, after a mid-innings blip, 50 off the last five to post a strong total.
Having taken over as India’s 20-overs captain after Virat Kohli relinquished the role following the World Cup, Rohit combined with Ishan Kishan (29) to give India a flying start.
Mitchell Santner (3-27) dismissed Kishan and Suryakumar Yadav in the same over and then Ish Sodhi took a sharp return catch from Rohit to bring some relief for the tourists.
India accelerated in the last five overs with Deepak Chahar providing the late assault with 21 off eight balls.
When they returned to defend the total, spinner Axar Patel (3-9) removed Daryl Mitchell and Mark Chapman in the same over to rattle New Zealand.
Guptill refused to get bogged down though, racing to a 33-ball fifty to keep New Zealand on course.
The opener clobbered four sixes and contributed 51 of the 69 runs that the tourists scored in the first 10 overs.
But once Yuzvendra Chahal removed Guptill in the 11th over, India had the game in the bag.
The teams will now lock horns in a two-Test series beginning in Kanpur on Thursday.

Photos and videos of Peng at a tournament in Beijing earlier on Sunday had earlier done little to dampen international concerns, following a nearly three-week public absence after she alleged that a former senior Chinese official sexually assaulted her.
France’s foreign minister had called on Chinese authorities to provide more reassurance, echoing a statement by the Women’s Tennis Association that the images were  “insufficient” proof.
“I’m expecting only one thing: that she speaks,” France’s Jean-Yves Le Drian told LCI television, adding that there could be unspecified diplomatic consequences if China did not clear up the situation. The United States and Britain had also called for China to provide proof of Peng’s whereabouts.
Current and former tennis players, from Naomi Osaka to Serena Williams to Billie Jean King, had joined the calls seeking to confirm she was safe.
The concern over Peng came as global rights groups and others have called for a boycott of the Winter Olympics in Beijing in February over China’s human rights record.

7,Solozano taken to hospital as SL take charge on first day,GALLE: Sri Lanka skipper Dimuth Karunaratne slammed an unbeaten hundred to give his team the upper hand in ...,"GALLE: Sri Lanka skipper Dimuth Karunaratne slammed an unbeaten hundred to give his team the upper hand in Sunday’s opening Test against the West Indies, whose debutant Jeremy Solozano was hospitalised after being hit while fielding.
Bad light forced an early end to the day’s play at the Galle  International Stadium with two overs remaining and the hosts finishing on 267-3.
Karunaratne batted through the day after winning the toss on a slow surface, making a 139-run stand for the first wicket with Pathum Nissanka.
Part-time spinner Roston Chase dismissed Oshada Fernando and Angelo Mathews for three each in quick succession to bring the West Indies back into the game.
But Sri Lanka wrestled back the initiative as Karunaratne shared a 97-run partnership with Dhananjaya de Silva for the fourth wicket.
This was Karunaratne’s 13th Test century and fourth this year. He has bagged more than 750 runs in 2021, including a career-best 244 against Bangladesh, despite only playing 10 innings.
The West Indies had a scare when Karunaratne attempted a full-blooded pull shot off the bowling of Chase and the ball crashed onto the helmet grill of Solozano, who was fielding at short leg.
Medical staff attended to him on the ground before he was taken on a stretcher to a waiting ambulance.
“He underwent scans at a hospital in Colombo and will be kept overnight for observation,” Arjuna de Silva, the head of the Sri Lanka Cricket medical panel, told AFP.
“There’s no internal bleeding and the scans show no structural damage,” he added.
He underwent scans at a hospital in Colombo, and will be kept overnight for observation, the West Indies said in a media release.
Shannon Gabriel provided the breakthrough for the tourists when he had Nissanka -- who was chasing a full delivery wide outside the off-stump -- caught by Rahkeem Cornwall at first slip for 56.
“We had to show patience and see through the first session. We overcame that tough period and from then on it was good for batting,” Nissanka told reporters.
“Disappointed I did the hard work and couldn’t make most of the start I got,” he added.
But they squandered an opportunity to dismiss Karunaratne on 14, when Cornwall found the outside edge of the bat but Jermaine Blackwood at slip was unable to hold on as he attempted a one-handed grab.
The West Indies unsuccessfully reviewed after Karunaratne played an uncharacteristic reverse sweep off the left-arm orthodox spin of Jomel Warrican and the ball struck his front pad.
Television replays showed the impact was outside off-stump.
The tourists lost their second review over a caught-behind appeal against Nissanka off the bowling of Chase.
They were denied a second wicket in the afternoon session when Warrican failed to take a return catch with Fernando on three.
But the reprieve was brief, with Fernando well caught by Nkrumah Bonner at short leg to give Chase his first wicket.
Mathews’ half-an-hour stay at the crease was unconvincing and the West Indies kept attacking with tight field settings.
In a bid to break the shackles, Mathews took on Chase attempting to clear the boundary but found the lone fielder Jason Holder at mid-wicket.
The West Indies took the second new ball soon after 80 overs but could not break the Karunaratne-de Silva partnership.
The tourists had surprised fans by leaving out Kemar Roach, their most experienced player and the eighth-highest Test wicket taker.

Despite the Sweden star’s two goals at the age of 40 years and 48 days, the Rossoneri slumped to their first loss of the season with a 4-3 defeat at Fiorentina.
Dusan Vlahovic was the hero of the night in Florence, scoring twice for Fiorentina. With 27 goals in 2021, the Serbia striker equalled Kurt Hamrin’s record from 1960 as the player with the most Serie A goals for Fiorentina in a single calendar year.
AC Milan remained in second place, provisionally level on points with Serie A leaders Napoli.
Vlahovic, who had been under fire from Fiorentina fans for refusing to sign a contract extension, put the hosts into what looked like a safe three-goal lead an hour into an error-strewn contest at the Stadio Artemio Franchi.
And he saved the home side again with five minutes to go by coolly finishing the fourth following Ibrahimovic’s two quick strikes, giving Fiorentina their first win of the season against one of Italy’s big boys.
Vincenzo Italiano’s Viola are up to sixth on 21 points, four away from the Champions League positions, after a win in which Alfred Duncan and Riccardo Saponara also netted for the hosts and Lorenzo Venuti — only playing in defence as three centre-backs were out injured — scored an unfortunate stoppage-time own goal.
I told the boys we are getting the reputation of being a team that can’t do it against the big clubs and that this was the time to show that it’s not the case,” said Italiano. It was a great achievement and I am very happy for the players.”
BONUCCI FIRES JUVE TO LAZIO WIN
Earlier, struggling Juventus ended Lazio’s 19-match unbeaten home record with a 2-0 win at Stadio Olimpico as Lazio coach Maurizio Sarri faced his former club.
Leonardo Bonucci scored both goals from the penalty spot as Juventus’ climb up the Serie A table continued following a rocky start to the campaign.
Italy defender Bonucci smashed home almost identical spot-kicks in each half in Rome to move Juve seventh, level on points with Fiorentina and fifth-placed Lazio.
It was a dogged, solid away performance typical of Massimiliano Allegri’s best sides and a good sign ahead of Tuesday’s trip to Stamford Bridge to face Premier League leaders Chelsea.
When you’re Juve and played like we did at the start of the season it’s right that you get criticised, but that should encourage us to improve,” said Bonucci after his first Serie A double.
It’s down to us to maintain the same spirit from tonight.”

Following up his win over the top-ranked player in the semi-finals of the Tokyo Olympics, Zverev overcame late nerves to secure a 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 6-3 victory over the world number one at the same stage of the ATP Finals on Saturday.  
“Every time we play against each other, it’s very high level,” Zverev said. “This year we played each other five times. ... Every time we played for multiple hours and it was very physical.” 
The result means Djokovic can’t match Roger Federer’s record of six titles at the season-ending event for the top eight players. At least not this year.  
Instead, Zverev will play second-ranked Daniil Medvedev in the final.  
“He’s the greatest player of all time and I think people forget that sometimes,” Zverev said of Djokovic, who shares the record of 20 Grand Slam titles with Federer and Rafael Nadal.  
It was a disappointing end to a remarkable season for Djokovic, who fell one match short of becoming the first man to win a calendar Grand Slam since Rod Laver in 1969 when he lost the US Open final to Medvedev.  
World number two Medvedev beat first-time qualifier Casper Ruud 6-4, 6-2 earlier on Saturday as he seeks to defend his title in the first edition of the tournament in Turin after 12 years in London.  
VACCINE DEMAND 
Djokovic said he has not yet decided whether he would compete at January’s Australian Open after organisers confirmed that all players must be vaccinated against Covid-19 if they want to compete at the season’s opening Grand Slam event. 
The nine-time Australian Open champion, has refused to say if he’s vaccinated or if he intends to get vaccinated. 
“We’ll see. We’ll have to wait and see,” he told reporters after his semi-final defeat. “I haven’t been talking to them, to be honest. I was just waiting to hear what the news is going to be and now that I know we’ll just have to wait and see.” 
If he does go to Australia, Djokovic can attempt to break a tie with Federer and Nadal and win a record 21st Grand Slam singles title.
The tournament is scheduled for Jan. 17-30. Melbourne, where January’s Grand Slam is held, has spent more than 260 days under lockdown during the Covid-19 pandemic and the government of the state of Victoria made clear last month there would be no concessions for unvaccinated players.

The lead accumulated by the sedate Nouman over the first three rounds, though, proved insurmountable for the chasing pack. 
Nouman became the new National Amateur Golf Champion here at the PAF Golf Course on Sunday, breaking Omar’s record for being the youngest winner of the event with an aggregate of three-under 285. 
“I love to be among the strongest and senior players and the win really counted to me because I got the honour of becoming the youngest national champion,” Nouman said. “It was tough to play here but I managed to win.” 
Salman finished eight strokes behind at 293 with Omar ending another stroke behind in third. Another six strokes behind were Hussain Hamid and Hamza Khattak. 
Humna Amjad clinched the ladies title with a 71 seeing her finish the three-round contest at one-over 217. Rimsha Ijaz ended in second place, six shots behind with her sister Parkha another seven behind in third. 
With the national amateur titles under their belts, Nouman and Humna can now qualify for international events. 
“Being able to represent Pakistan is a dream come true and I will work hard to win titles for the country in the world of golf,” Humna said. 
Col Waqar Ahmed won the senior amateurs’ title with a three-round aggregate of 235. He finished just two shots ahead of Zakir Hussain and Tariq Mehmood.

Barca’s 1-0 win against Espanyol on Saturday began the way Xavi wanted, with his team dominating the ball like the Spain great had when he joined Lionel Messi and Andres Iniesta to forge one of football’s greatest sides as its midfield maestro. 
But the same problems that had led to the demise of his predecessor soon emerged. Barca’s attack failed to turn their huge advantage in possession into shots on goal other than Memphis Depay’s second-half penalty, while their defence came apart in the final stretch. Only Espanyol’s misfiring forwards stopped the Catalan derby from ending in a draw. 
“Overall, I am happy, but it is clear that we have to improve,” Xavi said. “We are building a new project and these three points in a derby gives us a boost. It was tough because they could have scored. We were in control for 60, 70 minutes, but we should have been more patient and held onto the ball. It is a question of knowing how to interpret the match.”
The crowd of 74,000 chanted “Xavi! Xavi!” in the sixth minute in honor of the number Xavi wore for 17 seasons when he helped Barca win 25 titles. He was hired two weeks ago before an international break for club competition when Ronald Koeman was let go after one too many painful defeats. 
Barca moved into sixth place in La Liga, six points behind fourth-placed Atletico Madrid and eight points behind leaders Sevilla and second-placed Real Sociedad. 
Ivan Rakitic’s stoppage-time goal lifted Sevilla to the top of the table after fighting back for a 2-2 home draw with Alaves. 
Atletico also needed a late header by centre-back Felipe Monteiro to edge Osasuna 1-0 at home. 
Villarreal stayed winless on the road in seven league games this season after Celta Vigo came from behind for a 1-1 draw.

12,"Australia's Tim Paine embarrassed, distressed by 'sexting' scandal","""I feel completely gutted, but it’s all my doing, and I know resigning is the right call,” says Paine.","MELBOURNE: Tim Paine Sunday said Australian coach Justin Langer wanted him to remain as Test skipper, as he spoke of his  “distress” and  “embarrassment” over a sexting scandal that cost him his job.
The 36-year-old abruptly quit on Friday ahead of the Ashes series against England over a series of lewd text messages with a female colleague in 2017 that he had learnt were about to be made public.
Paine insisted it was his decision to resign and he wasn’t pushed.
“It was mine and mine alone,” he told the Melbourne Herald Sun in an interview.
“It was hard, but I know it’s the right thing to do. I feel completely gutted, but it’s all my doing, and I know resigning is the right call.” Paine said plenty of people wanted me to stay on, including Langer.
“JL (Justin Langer) told me he’s devastated,” he said.
“He was pretty firm that he wanted me to continue as captain, and again, once I explained to him the reasons that I thought resigning was the best thing to do, he was with me all the way.
“I’ve got messages from all my team-mates saying they’ve got my back, and that we all make mistakes, and we move on,” he added, insisting none of them had prior knowledge of the incident.
The series of sexually graphic exchanges were investigated in 2018 but Paine was cleared by Cricket Tasmania and CA’s integrity unit of breaching their code of conduct.
However, current CA chairman Richard Freudenstein, who was elected to the board in 2019, on Saturday admitted it was the wrong call and said Paine should have been axed at the time.
Paine, who is married with children, said the text message exchanges began as normal communications with a Cricket Tasmania colleague  “but then it became a flirtatious exchange that should never have”. He denied any physical relationship with the woman.
