0,What next? Karachi  waits with bated breath,Independent city-watchers find the incident and provincial govt’s response reflective of the neglect that Karachi is subject to.,"A WEEK after the blaze, stench and despair marked the environment as one visited the Cooperative Market in downtown Saddar. Workers were busy moving the remains from the gutted shops, while the owners were busy filling out loss assessment forms. The leaping flames extinguished life for close to 400 shops within hours.
The cause of fire and reasons for the rather high scale of destruction, despite multiple fire stations being in the vicinity, are yet to be established. The affected traders are staring at a bleak future unless the government steps in to restore some semblance of life in the badly damaged market.
“Some government officials, including the city administrator, paid fleeting visits and promised to approach the higher-ups on our behalf. So far, we have not received any commitment from the government for any rebuilding or compensation. 
“We, on our part, are trying to document the details of our respective losses. Over 300 forms circulated for the purpose have been returned. The collective loss of the traders has been worked out to be around Rs1.5 billion so far. Besides assets and stocks, a big chunk of cash also got burnt,” said Sheikh Muhammad Feroz, President of the Saddar Cooperative Market Society, while talking to Dawn. 
Elaborating on the cash part, he said the wholesalers in the market get payments cleared on Saturdays which they deposit in the banks on Mondays. Instead of carrying the cash around, they prefer to keep it secured in their shops over the weekend. 
Dissatisfied with the government response, the aggrieved traders have pinned hope on high-profile private-sector leaders of the city. “We have approached the Karachi Chamber and the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce & Industry for help to gain access to the government,” he said.
There were some voices in the market suspecting sabotage engineered by elements involved in the allegedly illegal sale/purchase of shops in the building. “I was here and saw the fire spreading. It didn’t seem like an accident at all,” stressed a bitter shop-owner on the site.

Sudden fires in the commercial hub, spike in street crimes and certain wall-chalkings are making life tough for a city that generates 40pc of national and 90pc of provincial resources

Independent city-watchers find the incident and the provincial government’s response reflective of the neglect that the city has been subjected to. “I find the city situation scary. It could be my paranoia. The sudden spike in street crimes, incidents of fire in commercial centres and overnight wall-chalkings point to the possible reactivation of some hidden forces,” said one observer. 
The office of the Sindh chief minister was approached, but the response was awaited till the filing of this report. 
On his part, city administrator Murtaza Wahab dismissed the perception of administrative neglect in the case of the fire incident as well as in general. He said he would like to wait for the inquiry report before commenting any further. He lamented the absence of fire safety equipment in the market which could have helped the traders to do something before the arrival of fire engines. He said 10 fire tenders had taken part in the operation under his watch. “The KPT fire station is beyond our jurisdiction so I can’t be accountable if it was not mobilised”.
Talking about life in general, he said the provincial government, with better focus, could have done better to lessen the water-related misery, but blamed the federal government squarely for the absence of public transport in the commercial hub of the country. 
“China agreed to finance the Karachi Circular Railway under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor in 2016, but the federal government declined the Chinese investors’ demand for sovereign guarantee. I am positive that over the next two years the situation will improve visibly as several initiatives in the sector are advancing at a satisfactory pace,” said Mr Wahab over the phone.
He thought the private sector’s expectations could have been higher, but ‘being hostile’ is too strong an expression to describe the provincial government’s relationship with the business community which, he insisted, counted the community among the key stakeholders.
When questioned why the business community in Karachi behaves differently despite stronger financial muscle than those in Sialkot, he thought the question needs to be directed to the private sector and not to the government. All he could do was to promise to share the data he was using for improving governance standards in Karachi. 
Some PPP stalwarts declined to comment on the specifics when approached but regretted the provincial government’s underperformance, which, according to them, had further eroded its base among the locals. “A party ruling the province for over a decade can’t possibly be absolved of the responsibility for the plight of the city,” said a leader privately.
“Despite its contribution to the national kitty, when it comes to basic civic amenities, like water, public transport, etc, Karachi is not just behind all its global counterparts, but fare much worse than several smaller cities within the country,” he conceded. 
Some estimates put the share of Karachi in total tax collection beyond 40 per cent of the national. In the province, the cosmopolitan city pitches over 90 per cent of the resources generated by the Sindh Board of Revenue. According to the published Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) data, the city under the head of income tax alone contributed Rs209bn in 2018 against Lahore’s Rs180bn.
Another senior member of the provincial team promised current data profiling all districts of Karachi “later”. 
Asad Ali Shah, CEO of an accounting firm and son of former chief minister Qaim Ali Shah, felt Karachi deserved more attention and better governance if the party wished to improve its image in the city. Apparently not a huge fan of Murtaza Wahab, he admitted that the quality of governance in Karachi is far from being satisfactory. 
He recalled the times when the PPP had a bit more fun in Karachi. “In the 1970 elections, the party won 20pc of the provincial seats and two of seven National Assembly seats marked for Karachi. In the first PPP government, Karachi had a good representation. Kamal Azfar was the finance minister and Haji Kassim Abbas Patel was heading the industries portfolio. In 1973, Begum Raana Liaqat Ali became the provincial governor and was succeeded by Mohammed Dilawar Khanji.”
He blamed the MQM for widening the rural-urban divide and for wiping out the PPP from typical Karachi localities. He was critical of the government’s poor relationship with the business community. In his opinion, the performance in the health sector was comparatively better. “By investing liberally in SIUT, NICVD, Jinnah Hospital, Trauma Centre, Indus Hospital and other such places, the government has served the city well. 
“I must add that a big portion of the blame rests with subsequent federal governments for drying up development funds for the city that supports the entire country with the taxes that are raised here.”

1,Focus reverts to stabilisation,The last few months underline the fallacy of the growth claims made by the government’s finance managers in spite of warnings.,"The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) pulled a big surprise on the market when it boosted its key policy rate last week by a lot more than anticipated by analysts to contain the soaring prices and stop the consistent decline in the rupee on a growing current account deficit. 
The monetary policy decision is indicative of the fact that the government is shifting its pivot from growth again to ‘stabilisation’ by rolling back the pandemic stimulus and expansive pro-cyclical policies that it was pursuing to push growth to win over the man on the street ahead of the 2023 elections.
The SBP decision comes on the heels of an announcement from the country’s finance chief Shaukat Tarin that Islamabad had sorted out issues obstructing the resumption of the $6 billion loan facility from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which had outlined five prior actions before its board approves the deal. 
Read more: Shaukat Tarin outlines five actions demanded by IMF
The prior actions include a passage from the parliament of the proposed amendments to the SBP Act to ‘free’ it from political influences, an increase in the electricity tariffs (which have partially been implemented while the next raise is expected in February), the introduction of measures to bolster taxes through withdrawal of income and sales tax exemptions and reduction in expenditure to achieve a primary balance this fiscal year.

The PTI government’s growth script has gone awry in just four months and now it is blaming international commodity prices for the mess it has created

The remaining conditions relate to the rollback of monetary stimulus and containment of imports by the central bank through an increase in the policy rate. 
With the rupee falling to its new lows and stocks plunging on delays in the finalisation of the IMF deal, it is crucial for a cash-strapped Pakistan to revive the programme as early as possible. Therefore, we saw the central bank bring forward the monetary policy committee meeting by a week to November 19 because of what it described as “unforeseen developments that have affected the outlook for inflation and the balance of payments, and to help reduce the uncertainty about monetary settings prevailing in the market.”
Read more: Falling rupee
The bank has raised its benchmark rate by 150bps to 8.75 per cent to “stay ahead of the market as yields have already increased in the secondary market to 8.6pc”. The rate increase compares with wider market expectations in the range of 75bps-100bps. This is the second consecutive hike in its policy rate announced by the SBP. 
The bank had in its September monetary policy statement jacked up the interest rate by a mere 25bps for the first time in 15 months with a view to protecting economic growth by keeping “inflation expectations anchored and slowing the growth in the current account deficit.” It has since taken multiple steps to ease domestic demand, including restricting consumer financing and raising cash reserve requirements for the banks to absorb excess liquidity from the market at the cost of slowing the economy’s recovery.
The bank sees risks to inflation and balance of payments to have increased in the last two months while the outlook for growth has continued to improve. It also sees the current account deficit for the present fiscal year to “modestly” exceed its forecast of 2pc-3pc of GDP while global commodity prices and potential further upward adjustments in administered prices of energy pose upside risks to inflation.
Hence, there is now a need to proceed faster to normalise monetary policy to counter inflationary pressures and preserve stability with growth. In its forward guidance, the bank has hinted at a further increase in the cost of credit going forward to achieve mildly positive real interest rates. Last time, it had expected the monetary policy to remain accommodative in the near term in the absence of ‘unforeseen circumstances’. It has also announced an increase in monetary policy transmission frequency from existing six reviews to eight reviews a year.
The headline consumer prices, which had spiked by 9.2pc last month, are widely anticipated to enter the double digits when the PBS publishes Consumer Price Index numbers for November. The average inflation for the entire year is also expected to remain in the double digits, well above the central bank’s 7pc-9pc target range.
Pakistan’s current account deficit has already expanded to 4.7pc of GDP to $5.1bn in the first four months of the current fiscal from a surplus of 1.4pc or $1.3bn a year ago on spiking trade deficit. The trade deficit has more than doubled to $13.8bn from $6.8bn during the period between July and October on a sharp rise in imports and global commodity prices. The trade in services gap also rose by 38pc to over $1bn from $750 million. 
The increase in remittances sent by overseas Pakistanis has been slower as is the case exports with foreign direct investment flows declining to $662m from $751m, bringing pressure on debt-based forex reserves. The rupee has slumped almost 13pc since mid-May, making it the worst performer in Asia. 
Read more: Foreign direct investment falls 12pc in July-Oct
If anything, the last few months underline the fallacy of the growth claims made by the PTI government’s finance managers in spite of warnings that the blind pursuit of such policies without addressing deep-rooted structural issues of the economy and boosting productivity and exports would bring pressure on the weak external sector and have serious consequences. 
Nonetheless, the government recklessly insisted it could achieve 4.8pc growth this year without any disruptions to the economy. But no. Its growth script has gone awry in just four months and now it is blaming international commodity prices for the mess it has created in the form of expanding current account deficit and the fastest inflation across the region as prices in Pakistan have been increasing at twice the pace in other countries like the Philippines, India, Thailand and on and on. Finalising a deal with the lender of the last resort has become crucial to ending uncertainty in the market and restoring confidence. But it will bring back more pain for the man on the street.

2,Banks must raise long-term deposits,Central bank is supposed to ensure that all banks discharge their primary responsibility of financial intermediation efficiently.,"Pakistan’s banking industry suffers from short-termism just like many other sectors of the economy do. The industry, on the whole, makes little effort to mobilise long-term deposits. And that, in turn, makes it difficult for banks to offer long-term loans.
That is why they mostly provide short-term working capital to the private sector. And when it comes to investing in government debt papers, short-term Treasury Bills become their first choice. They invest in long-term Pakistan Investment Bonds only when the bonds offer very lucrative rates of return.
The central bank is supposed to ensure that all banks discharge their primary responsibility of financial intermediation efficiently. One way for achieving this objective is to incentivise banks to mobilise long-term deposits in the absence of which they cannot make enough long-term loans.
Only recently the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has done just that. While raising the cash reserve requirement or CRR for banks on Nov 13, it decided that one-year plus time liabilities of banks would continue to remain exempted from CRR. “This will encourage banks to raise more long-term deposits, which will facilitate asset-liability matching and enable banks to extend long-term loans for construction and housing finance,” the SBP said in a press release. Mentioning construction and housing finance was necessary for the SBP, perhaps, to remain on the “same page” with the government trying to give the construction sector a boost. But as a matter of principle, the central bank actually wants the banking industry to minimise the asset-liability mismatch that banks create themselves and then use as an excuse for not making enough long-term loans.

The increase in the number of total bank accounts that we keep hearing from the SBP is originating primarily from compulsory accounts — ie the accounts that individuals and firms and even receivers of the state cash-handouts must have with one bank or another

As of September 2021, only one-third of all bank financing was categorised as fixed investment or long-term loans which also included the post-Covid concessional long-term financing, SBP data reveals.
On the other hand, working capital constituted about 40 per cent of total bank financing — even without including short-term import/export financing. These numbers are derived from the stock of the total financing and may not reflect the same proportion of short-term and long-term financing being offered currently. But they do reflect the trend.
The reasons why banks remain shy of offering long-term finance are many and diverse. But the most important one is that they do not have enough matching long-term fixed deposits. As of June 2021, only 8.5pc of the banking systems total deposits worth Rs19.135 trillion fell in the category of fixed deposits of one year or longer tenure.
This situation is far from ideal. Banks need to roll out more financial products to attract long-term fixed deposits. And, the central bank needs to keep pushing them to do that. Keeping one-year plus time deposits exempted from CRR to encourage banks to mobilise more long-term deposits is good. But the central bank must also seek feedback from banks on what keeps the share of fixed deposits low in their total deposits. And, after examining that feedback on merit it may consider designing a “carrot-and-stick” policy for banks to enhance the share of long-term deposits in their overall deposit base.
Banks often complain that high rates of return offered on long-term National Saving Schemes (NSS) makes the task of long-term deposit mobilisation difficult for them. The government normally pays a little higher return to widows and senior citizens when they invest money in NSS. And, that makes sense. But on other NSS instruments, the rates of return are only moderately higher than what banks could easily pay on deposits of similar tenure if they (1) come up with customer-friendly features of long-term deposits and (2) make stronger efforts to cut the cost of deposit mobilisation, in particular, and their overall cost of operations, in general.
Most of the growth originating in the deposit base of the banking system is due to the incremental current account and saving account deposits.
Every government pushes the agenda of greater documentation of the economy — and rightly so. Such documentation drives eventually make it mandatory for individuals and businesses to open and operate bank accounts though they seldom bring in top tax-evaders in the tax net.
Transfer payments through bank accounts in social sectors via welfare programmes like Ehsaas also lead to an increase in the number of bank accounts, most of which are current or saving accounts. The phenomenal growth in recent years in domestic e-commerce should also be credited for increasing the number of bank accounts.
In all such cases, banks’ own efforts for encouraging people to open bank accounts remain nominal. Worse still is the fact that despite the total number of bank accounts increasing due to the factors listed above, banks apparently do not use this factor to help them generate more long-term deposits. Short-term deposits in such accounts grow, however. And, the growth rate depends upon the overall economic situation and specific needs of account holders.
A closer study of the structure of banks’ deposits lends some credence to the above analysis. In June 2019, the total number of banks’ deposit accounts stood above 54.134 million. In June 2021, this number shot up to 66.884m — a neat addition of 23.5pc within two years, according to the SBP stats. Dissecting these numbers we find out that in June 2019 current deposit accounts constituted 61.6pc of the total bank deposits.
Comes June 2021 and current deposit accounts make up 66pc of the total deposit accounts. This situation is not conducive to growth in savings and investment. And it clearly indicates that the increase in the number of total bank accounts that we keep hearing from the SBP is originating primarily from “compulsory accounts”— ie the accounts that individuals and firms and even receivers of the state cash-handouts must have with one bank or another.—MA

3,Shikarpur’s potential for diversified agriculture,"If oilseed issues of research, development and marketing are addressed the area can improve its yield to lessen ...","


 
Gone are the days when Shikarpur used to bask in the glory of its marvellous past. It used to be a famous trade centre for the entire region. This perhaps remains the only walled city of Sindh but unfortunately faces ravages of time. Despite its strategic position, Shikarpur is considered one of the backward districts of Sindh. It is located on the right bank of the mighty Indus.   
The history of Shikarpur, once the centre of knowledge and learnings, was influenced by its geography. It was located at the confluence of Mughals in North and East, the Safavids (Iran) to the West and various Afghan and Central Asian kingdoms to the Northwest. Historically, Shikarpur was known for its architectural marvels. Its old inhabitants — mainly Hindus — had contributed to the city’s infrastructure building. Its name is derived from the word shikar (hunting) as it had plenty of forests.  
The city has been included in the 2008 and 2010 World Monuments Watch List of ‘100 Most Endangered sites’ published by the World Monuments Fund (WMF). In 2014, it has made the list for the third time in less than six years. The WMF website says Shikarpur became the hub of a major financial network stretching from the Indian subcontinent to Central Asia and beyond. Durrani Afghans took control of it in the mid-19th century and fostered the creation of a melting pot for merchants of diverse origins — Sikh, Hindu, and Muslim.
While the district struggles to see its old glory restored, a social stigma, however, remains attached to it. Shikarpur, now, is also bracketed with the infamous jirga system. Some of the leading lights of tribes find their roots in this district and continue to rule the roost regardless of democratic or unelected dispensation in the country. This tribal influence in the area has refused to die down despite repeated court orders against jirgas, a parallel judicial system.  

If oilseed issues of research, development and marketing are addressed the area can improve its yield to lessen Pakistan’s import bill of edible oil

“Shikarpur is infamous from the women perspective. Poor women are killed as kari” (honour killings) or trafficked,” argues women rights activist Amar Sindhu. We have reports of imprisonment of lal aurtain —women who seek shelter of some tribal chief after having been declared as kari but later they are sold, she says.  
Mahars, Durranis, Bhayyo, Jatoi, Sudhranis and other clans are the second names of Shikarpur’s deeply rooted jirga system. They, of course, are educated men with large landholdings and are cultivating lands in a riverine area known for its soil fertility due to heavy silt deposits by the Indus river.
Shikarpur has also produced men of letters like iconic Sindhi poet Shaikh Ayaz. Sindh’s chief minister Allah Bux Soomro was from Shikarpur before the partition. He was assassinated there in 1943. His nephew Illahi Bux Soomro served as speaker National Assembly. Most Soomros, Shaikhs, Jatois and Mahars prefer living — like many other baronial landlords — in urban centres like Karachi and Islamabad. But they use their native city as their political base to maintain a firm stranglehold over politics and subsequently governance in successive civil and military regimes. But then every cloud has a silver lining. 
Shikarpur matters as an important area in terms of agriculture production — mainly rice. Of total Sindh’s rice acreage (750,529ha recently) Shikarpur has a share of 15 per cent with 117,264ha as per statistics compiled by Hina Shahid in EU funded survey 2018. 
Coarse and basmati varieties of rice are produced as a mono-crop in the Kharif season. Wheat as a Rabi crop is sown on residual moisture of rice crop as growers lack options for alternative crops. Veggies are grown with okra being transported to Quetta’s market usually. 
Guddu barrage’s right bank Begari Sindh (BS) feeder feeds Shikarpur district mainly. It has a designed discharge of 14,764 cusecs to irrigate 1,001,910 acres of land in its command. The large riverine area is connected with Shikarpur which is famous for its achaar (pickles), qulfi faluda (ice cream) and a soft drink. Pickles are Shikarpur’s identity across Pakistan, nay the world. 
“Besides rice, we have the potential for oilseed crops as well but we lag only because we don’t have a market here,” says Arsala Seelro. He has been cultivating canola in Shikarpur regularly until five years back but then had to give up after realising that an inadequate price is offered by buyers. “Our produce is taken to Punjab from here for marketing and we didn’t get an adequate price to meet our cost of production and earn some money as well,” Seelro contends. He also believes that monopoly by ricer millers also leads to cartelization that seeks to deny a just price for the rice crop. 
A veteran rice grower, Haji Ameer Bux Pahore subscribes to Seerlo’s view. “We cultivate coarse and basmati variety but the price regime isn’t in our favour”, he says. He points out that Shikarpur doesn’t get the required flows. This area is under the non-perennial command of the canal and wheat was sown on paddy crop’s residual moisture. “We feel lucky if we get additional flows after rice crop harvesting,” he says. He also sheds light on the fact that Shikarpur had once witnessed tobacco cultivation. Quality of tobacco was also fine, he adds. 
Sunflower cultivation was given some attention in the backdrop of the super floods of 2010 that had led to mass-scale displacement from right bank districts including Shikarpur. Standing paddy crop was badly hit as well. Growers in flood-affected right bank districts were given an opportunity to go for sunflower cultivation under the United States Agency for International Development funded project for the cultivation of corps on 100,000 acres in flood-hit districts in a collaborative effort with Sindh Abadgar Board (SAB). “Later we learnt that sunflower yields are declining fast but no research was conducted as to why it is happening. As a result, growers lost interest in oilseed crops that can serve as an alternative to imported oil, involving expenditures of foreign exchange,” says SAB vice president Mahmood Nawaz Shah.
Shikarpur has the potential for diversified agriculture. For instance, researchers can recommend alternate crops in addition to wheat. Likewise, if oilseed crops issues of research, development and marketing are addressed the area can come up with a better yield of oilseed crops — sunflower and canola chiefly — to lessen Pakistan’s import bill of edible oil. But these areas are not yet given attention.
As per the 2018 project livestock population, the Sindh livestock department estimates Shikarpur’s share in Sindh’s cattle and buffalo population as 1.80pc and 2.18pc respectively and 0.70pc in sheep and 1.21pc in goats.

4,Smart drafting of tax laws,Amendments pertaining to customs need to be examined if authors are beneficiaries of the changes to the customs law.,"The government promulgated the presidential ordinance — the Tax Laws (Third Amendment) Ordinance 2021 — on September 15 bringing certain enforcement measures on the premise of improving documentation of the national economy, enhancing tax compliance and broadening the tax base. 
While it has become law and has been in force since then, it has a limited life of 120 days unless passed into permanent law by the parliament. The bill to adopt the ordinance into an act of Parliament has already been rejected by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue last week. 
The major reasons for the rejection, mostly pertained to income tax and sales tax provisions including the mandatory conditions for the corporate sector to completely switch over to digital payments (instead of manual like cheques etc) with effect from December 1, 2021, and the disconnection of utility connections including mobile phones to those who do not appear on the active taxpayers’ list.
The committee has also ordered a written explanation from the Chairman Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) as to where these proposals had originated and rejected the directive of the prosecution for unauthorised disclosure of information by a public servant.
However, the focus has so far not reached the amendments in the customs law through the same — Tax Laws (Third Amendment) — Ordinance bringing three amendments in the customs law which broadened the discretion of the custom officials and risk of massive revenue losses at the import stage.

The amendments pertaining to customs need to be examined if authors are beneficiaries of the changes to the custom law

One such amendment has transferred from the Customs Appellate Tribunal to the Member Customs Policy (FBR), the power to hear appeals against the decisions and judgments of Director General Customs Valuation, enabling a custom officer to make, in his capacity as Collector, under-assessments of duty and taxes on arbitrarily low values and then empowering the same officer to finally uphold such low and arbitrary values in his capacity of appellate authority as Member Custom Policy.
One such situation involving bulky amounts is already under investigation in FBR. The Custom Intelligence Department of FBR has pointed out revenue losses worth billions of rupees alleging that the collectors of Quetta Customs have been assessing duty and taxes on imported goods at very low and arbitrary values in violation of much higher assessment values lawfully determined by the director valuation.
Among those blamed for these revenue losses are now in the FBR headquarter and it appeared the changes to the custom law are designed to make those investigations infructuous. Member Policy Customs FBR may have to explain the shrewd move behind the amendment. This is important because if the director-general valuation, in the exercise of his powers under the custom law, rejects the assessable values used by collectors in Quetta, one of those accused collectors will now be able to strike down the DG’s decision and uphold the allegedly illegal values used by him and others during their tenure as collectors. 
Another amendment adds the word ‘corporate guarantee’ after the word ‘bank guarantee’ in the provision of custom law dealing with provisional assessments of duty and taxes on imported goods against a security. Obviously, the bank guarantee is an encashable instrument unlike a corporate guarantee, which more often than not, remains a priceless paper.
The amendment has widened the custom officials’ discretion to demand bank guarantee from the importers in cases of provisional assessments and finally settle down for an easier and much softer security of corporate guarantee in return for personal monetary gain. This opens the gate for negotiations between the importer and the custom officials at the cost of revenue loss.
A third amendment in the custom law has enhanced the incentive for the assessing custom officials to collude with importers and clearing agents in minting money causing revenue losses in the process.
The custom law, before this amendment, provided that; “if during the checking of a Goods Declaration it is found that any statement in such declaration or document or any information so furnished is not correct in respect of any matter relating to the assessment, the goods shall, without prejudice to any other action, which may be taken under the Custom Act, be reassessed to duty, taxes and other charges levied thereon”. This provision imposed upon the assessing custom officials a requirement of stringent scrutiny of the Goods Declarations at the time of custom clearance of imported goods. 
The amendment has added the phrase: “or, notwithstanding the provisions of Custom Act, within three years of its clearance,” thus relaxing the requirement of stringent scrutiny of Goods Declarations at the custom clearance stage and providing the assessing custom officials one more incentive to collude with the clearing agents in making money at the cost of revenue losses.
This amendment has also diluted the power of custom intelligence which, before the amendment, was used to incriminate the assessing custom officials in the cases made by them against offences committed and the revenues lost at the custom clearance stage.
The amendment has, in effect, set at liberty the custom officers dealing with the assessment and custom clearance of imported goods. Now if the custom intelligence comes across such cases of wrong valuations after a year or two and start proceedings to hold officials answerable for undervaluation, the assessing officials could go unchallenged on grounds they still had time to correct valuation but practically such materials are generally get consumed. It needs to be examined if authors are beneficiaries of the amendments to the custom law.

5,The spanner in the works,Approximately 25pc of the companies in the country are zombie firms such as public ...,"Since it came into power, the PTI government has been struggling to boost industrialisation particularly manufacturing. But owing to uncertainties in the business environment the long-term industrial investment in greenfield projects has not picked up to a level to make a difference.
The historical trend of imbalanced development of the country’s three major sectors of the economy remains largely unaddressed, creating hurdles in the path of long-term sustainable economic growth, despite the V-shaped recovery officially claimed last fiscal year.
The fastest expanding services sector accounted in 2020-21 for 68.68 per cent of GDP, agriculture 19.9pc and industry 19.2pc which included large-scale manufacturing (LSM) contribution of 9.73pc, according to provisional data. The year was marked by a notable LSM recovery. And in the service sector, the financial sub-sector alone accounted for 33pc of the GDP.
There is no industrial revolution on the horizon in Pakistan thanks to the policies adopted by clueless policymakers over the last many decades, writes former civil servant Syed Saadat in his latest newspaper article.
Among adverse factors hampering meaningful industrial expansion, spotlighted in recent public debate, is the tardy progress of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects some of which are being stalled because of delays in power purchase payments to the Chinese investors. The Chinese investors are seeking sureties that the new power plants do not get stuck in the circular debt. The government is paying Kibor plus 2pc cost to the sponsors of Chinese power plants that is delayed beyond a certain period.

Approximately 25pc of the companies in the country are zombie firms such as public sector enterprises causing massive revenue loss by declaring losses

“We are trying to save Gwadar power plant, Karot power plant, Kohala power plant and three other projects from the adverse impact of delay in the payment of Rs250 billion to Chinese sponsors,” says special assistant on CPEC affairs Khalid Mansoor. 
He however believes that the key to the success of the second phase of the CPEC project lies in Special Economic Zones (SEZs) which, he adds, are being developed on a priority basis. He did not say when the SEZs would be ready with the required one-window facility.
The completion of power projects and Special Economic Zones are vital for bringing foreign investment in industrial joint ventures with domestic partners in efficiency-seeking sectors and technology transfer in order to generate exports and save dollars through import substitution, says an analyst. 
Owing to the slow progress of the CPEC 
programme, FDI from (foreign direct investment) from China dropped (for the first time in recent years) by 50pc in the first quarter of 2021-22 to $76.9 million, down from $154.9m in the same period of 2020-21.
The country’s total import bill surged by 65pc to $25.1bn during July-October compared to $15.7bn in the corresponding four months of last fiscal year. And exports posted a growth of close to 25pc to reach $9.46bn, up from $7.57bn.
The machinery import bill primarily for the modernisation and expansion projects accounted for $3.71bn, 40.7pc higher than $2.63bn for the same period of last year. And $3bn was spent on food purchases, registering a 37pc increase over $2.2bn.
Pakistan faces a boom and bust cycle owing to a lack of industrial depth and sustainable economic growth hinges on a strong industrial base, says an analyst.
There is only one solution to the economic challenges facing the country, says Chief Executive Officer of Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises Development Authority (SMEDA) Hashim Raza, and elaborates: “We have to increase our production base and labour capacity.”
Though the SME sector has been accorded a high priority in the official ‘bottom up’ policy, the government has yet to announce the SME Policy 2021-25 to address such issues as easing of the regulatory environment and addressing SME market constraints, both on supply and demand side. On November 15, the Economic Coordination Committee of the Cabinet (ECC) directed that the SMEDA rules should be incorporated in the summary prepared by the Ministry of Industries and Production to provide an enabling environment for SMEs.
It was also decided that the industries minister, the finance advisor and the State Bank of Pakistan governor would further consult among themselves for finalising SME financing.
Yet another historical legacy posing a rising challenge to industrial growth has recently been highlighted by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) in its first of its kind report ‘Zombie Firms in Pakistan and Tax Revenue Lag.’ 
The report estimates that approximately 25pc of the companies in the country are zombie firms such as public sector enterprises causing massive revenue loss by declaring losses.
A zombie firm is defined as a lossmaking entity that has lost the ability to generate enough profits to make interest payments and survives on the repeated refinancing of its loans. This misallocation of credit, the FBR report observes, indicates that reallocation does not always benefit the healthier, innovative and more productive firms. The support to zombie firms impairs competition and is a real challenge for Pakistan’s economic growth.
While appreciating the contribution of banks in hard times to support troubled firms, the FBR experts estimate that roughly some $3bn short-term bank credit flows to the country’s zombie firms annually.
The public sector firms, faced with a high level of debts and overcapacity have created a debt cycle and are often forced to borrow from banks to repay their interest payments. Banks lend to them because they come with a government guarantee, and even keep lending with the non-performing loans.
In view of the FBR experts, the misuse of tax exemptions and tax holidays has remained a festering sore for the Pakistani economy. Zombie firms eat up these incentives and prevent the intended benefit to reach the targeted segments of the economy. The loss of industrial productivity and overall job losses results in an indirect loss of potential taxes.
On the other hand, the spending on the development of social and physical infrastructure, though badly needed to stimulate private industrial investment, is slowing down. In the first quarter of this fiscal year, only Rs46bn has been disbursed from the budgeted Rs900bn PSDP (Federal Public Sector Development Programme) and the annual PSDP size is also being reportedly cut by Rs200bn.

6,Improving refinery utilisation,All of Pakistan’s refineries should be up and running at maximum capacity to meet rising demand and ease pressure on our imports.,"The reopening of the global economy after pandemic-induced lockdowns and travel restrictions increased crude oil consumption. The surge in fuel demand has pushed oil prices through the roof. That’s weighing heavily on Pakistan, an oil-importing country. To make matters worse, the country’s oil refineries have been running well below their installed capacities forcing Pakistan to import expensive fuels. To soften the blow policymakers should take measures that can help push refinery utilisation higher. 
The world’s crude oil consumption was more than 101 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2019, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), but dropped to 92.42m bpd in 2020. The fall in demand pushed oil prices to historic lows. But from this year, oil demand started to recover after restrictions eased. The global oil consumption could increase to 97.73m bpd in 2021, as per the EIA’s estimate, and seems well on its way to climbing back to pre-pandemic levels soon. 
Pakistan is also seeing an increase in crude oil consumption. In the first three months of the current financial year (Jul-Sep), the oil marketing companies sold 6.08m metric tonnes of petroleum products like petrol, kerosene, and diesel, up from 5.13m mt in the same period last year, according to data compiled by Oil Companies Advisory Council (OCAC). 
The demand for fuels, particularly petrol and diesel, could improve further in the coming quarters amid an increase in business activities, rising automobile sales and an uptick in transportation activity. But even if consumption remains similar to the first quarter levels in the subsequent nine months, then we can estimate more than 24m mt of fuel offtake for the full fiscal year ending June 2022. This will be higher than the pre-pandemic consumption of around 18m mt seen in 2018-19. The estimate includes petrol and diesel sales of 9.49m mt and 8.48m mt for 2021-22 respectively, up from 7.35m mt (petrol) and 7.19m mt (diesel) in 2018-19. 

Ideally, at this time, all of Pakistan’s refineries should be up and running at maximum capacity to meet the rising demand and ease pressure on our imports

On the global stage, the increase in crude oil consumption is not being accompanied by a commensurate rise in supplies. While demand is rapidly growing, the Organisation of Petroleum, Exporting Countries members, their allies, and the US shale drillers are increasing oil production slowly. The mismatch in supply and demand has pushed Brent oil price to more than $80 a barrel from $52 at the start of this year. That’s made things difficult for Pakistan which had to spend $2.89 billion in the Jul-Oct period to import petroleum products, up from $1.5bn last year, as per data from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics. This hurt the country’s trade balance. 
Ideally, at this time, all of Pakistan’s refineries should be up and running at maximum capacity to meet the rising demand and ease pressure on our imports. Pakistan has five major oil refineries that can process up to 19.4m metric tonnes of crude oil each year to produce petrol, diesel, and other fuels. They reduce the country’s need to purchase expensive refined products and instead import lower-valued crude oil. 
Sadly, the refinery utilisation rates have remained quite low in the past few years. In 2020-21, the average refinery utilisation rate was just around 60 per cent and remained at this level in the first three months of the ongoing fiscal year, OCAC data shows.  
On the other hand, the oil refiners in several countries have cranked up volumes to satisfy the growing demand for transportation fuels. In India, which is one of the world’s largest producers and exporters of refined petroleum products, the biggest state-owned refiner India Oil Corp. operated its nine plants at 90pc of their installed capacity in October, up from 82pc in the previous month. Meanwhile, the four state-owned oil refining companies in China, the world’s second-biggest crude oil consumer, ran their plants at an average utilisation rate of 81pc in the first 10 months of this year, up from 78pc in the same period last year, data from S&P Global shows. 
The low utilisation rates in Pakistan are due to the fact that nearly all of the local refineries are based on hydro skimming technology and therefore produce approximately 30pc furnace oil whenever they process crude. The furnace oil demand fell sharply in Pakistan after the power generation companies — the primary consumers of this fuel — modified their plant operations under a government directive and started using natural gas. Although furnace oil consumption picked up this year due to the global shortage and high prices of LNG, this might be a temporary phenomenon. The long-term outlook is still looking uncertain. 
Moreover, refineries can’t export the fuel since the international demand for high sulphur furnace oil, which our refineries produce, has also plunged after the International Maritime Organisation introduced strict environmental regulations. This has forced Pakistani refineries to cut utilisation rates.
Refineries need to upgrade plants that will take their petrol and diesel yields higher while pushing their furnace oil output lower. The upgrades, however, are expensive and can cost anything between $200m to $1bn, as per various industry estimates. 
The good news is that all of the publically traded oil refineries have chalked up their upgradation plans and some have started construction work. One major refinery expects upgrades to increase its combined yield for petrol and diesel to 80pc and reduce furnace oil yield to just 10pc. The oil companies have been waiting for the government to introduce a new policy framework that will give them the support and incentives required to complete the capital intensive modernisation projects. 
There seems to be a lack of consensus among policymakers. Whatever the reason, the delay is putting strain on the country’s finances amid rising oil prices. If the government had introduced the oil refinery policy last year, the refineries might have already done a large chunk of work on their upgradation projects and could be getting closer to increasing their petrol and diesel production. 
Their utilisation rates could shoot up to 90pc or higher once they finish work. Average capacity utilisation of 85pc for the Pakistani industry could translate into more than 100,000 barrels per day of additional domestic production of value-added refined products. That’s like installing a major new oil refinery. This might have eased pressure on our import requirements.

7,Data points,Boost productivity with WFH,"Boost productivity with WFH
Working from home (WFH) around one day a week will boost productivity by 4.8pc as the post-Covid economy takes shape, according to a recent study of more than 30,000 US employees co-authored by José María Barrero of Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México and others. Much of that one-off increase is projected to come from reduced commuting time, a factor not usually captured by economists. In remarks on Aug. 17, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell alluded to a fundamental shift: “I think we know that we’re not simply going back to the economy we had before the pandemic, but it will take time to see exactly what the changes will be.” The pandemic has weakened the gravitational pull of city centres, with new forces now reshaping knowledge-based economies. Public transport journeys into cities are down, as are coffee shop sales, while demand for real estate in leafy suburbs is up. New digital tools mean that retail and hospitality — as well as knowledge-intensive industries — are already undergoing far-reaching change.

Changing MBA
Each year, EY hires about 200 to 300 MBA graduates well-versed in the foundations of finance, marketing, and economics who inject a dose of enthusiasm — and youth — into the accounting firm’s global workforce of 312,000. But the new hires are not always equipped to respond to rapid changes in the business landscape, so EY last year introduced an in-house MBA to teach tech-centric skills that traditional programs sometimes gloss over. “Technologies are changing so quickly that it had to be future-focused,” says Trent Henry, EY’s global vice chair of talent. EY is among a growing number of companies developing bespoke MBAs after concluding that university programs aren’t keeping pace with their needs. Employers want B-school graduates to be equipped to tackle broad-scale digital transformation, according to executive education consultant CarringtonCrisp, which recently published a survey of international employers finding that 77pc believe the traditional MBA needs to change. Corporations are taking a more active role, investing in rather than just hiring talent.

The grass is greener
This fall had been billed across corporate America as the Great Office Reopening. The Delta variant intervened, and mandatory return-to-office plans turned optional. Still, many people chose to report back to their desks. In New York a November survey of 188 major employers showed that 8pc of Manhattan office workers are back in the office full time, 54pc are fully remote and everyone else — nearly 40pc — is hybrid. Few are finding it a smooth transition period. Some companies used their tentative return dates as an unwitting excuse to avoid questions about how to balance the needs of their remote and in-person employees. That has resulted in a mushy middle ground: video calls where remote workers have trouble hearing, a sense that people at home are missing out on perks (teammates), while those in the office are, too (pyjamas). And the stakes aren’t just who is getting talked over in meetings. It’s whether flexibility is sustainable, even with all the benefits it confers.

Stealing crypto
In April, after a Coinbase user bought 200 bitcoin, a notification popped up, alerting them that their account had been locked, according to a complaint filed by the US Attorneys Office in Los Angeles. Although the notification appeared to be from Coinbase, it wasn’t. Instead, the fake notification was the first step in alleged fraud. In the moments that followed, almost $11.6m in crypto, about 206 bitcoin, was removed from the user’s account, investigators said. The Coinbase user, who was identified in court documents only as G.R., called a phone number on the notification, thinking it would connect to a Coinbase customer service rep, according to a federal complaint filed by investigators last month. An unidentified individual answered the call and asked G.R. to make a series of changes to the account, according to the complaint.

13,Monetary policy in tricky times,Economic stabilisation that SBP wants to achieve via monetary tightening has become necessary to contain the overheating economy.,"The first step was apparently not “measured”. A mere 25 basis points increase in the policy rate announced on September 20 was not enough to contain growing inflation. Raging winds of inflation ignored it and intensified “inflationary noise” and “inflation expectations.”
(National average year-on-year consumer inflation rose 9.2 per cent in October from 9pc in September).
On November 19, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) had no other option but to use the full might of monetary tightening to calm the vortex of inflationary pressures. It raised the policy rate by 150bps to 8.75pc — much to the chagrin of the government for which the cost of commercial bank borrowing has now become prohibitive. The doors of borrowing from the central bank are already closed on the government which means it will have to make further cuts in its development budgets. Governments in Pakistan seldom bother to reduce administrative expenses. We all know that. 
The big rate rise will also dampen the demand for bank credit of the private sector thereby moderating the current growth momentum. And, the private sector’s fresh borrowing from banks would also become too expensive thus forcing them to compromise on their business expansion plans, reduce output and even lay off workers where necessary. Sadly then, the recent monetary tightening is also not “measured” — or so it seems. And, common sense dictates that a 150bps rate rise after a 25bps increase should not be termed as “gradual” either.

A full dose of monetary tightening of 150bps is expected to contain inflationary pressures by suppressing demand which would ultimately depress growth momentum and may even affect job creation

After preparing the ground for “inflation targeting” back in March this year, the central bank had promised that monetary tightening — as and when it becomes necessary — would be “gradual” and “measured”. 
The purpose was to lend the government and the private sector the confidence they needed to design and implement medium-term economic and business growth policies. 
The March 2021 monetary policy statement of the SBP was significant in that it had projected a numerical value for the “medium-term” inflation outlook — 7-9pc — in a clear sign of initiating inflation targeting at an appropriate time. Inflation targeting makes it possible for a central bank to focus on managing inflation without bothering about the economic growth rate. Pakistan’s central bank is required under the Constitution to take care of both inflation and economic growth. It, therefore, cannot start inflation targeting unless a constitutional amendment clears the way for it. 
It is not clear yet whether the recent amendment to the laws that govern the central bank (introduced through the SBP Banking Services Corporation (Amendment) Bill 2021 has accorded the central bank the “autonomy” it required for inflation targeting. (This bill, was among the 33 bills bulldozed through a joint session of the Parliament just two days before the announcement of the latest monetary policy — a week ahead of the schedule). 
While announcing the policy rate hike on November 19, the SBP informed the nation that from now onwards it would review its monetary policy eight times a year instead of six times a year. And, it also shared the schedule of the next five meetings of its monetary policy committee to be held before the close of the current fiscal year in June.
This is also a clear indication that the SBP intends to move towards ‘inflation targets’ though it is yet to make a formal announcement in this regard. Central banks that practice inflation targeting review their monetary policies more frequently than others. 
Back in September when the SBP had raised the policy rate by just 25bps inflation, Consumer Price Index inflation was 9pc — the threshold where it starts hurting economic growth in the country, according to the central bank’s own finding. But the reason why the SBP had avoided a higher policy rate hike at that time was that it rather wanted to keep the monetary policy “appropriately supportive of growth”.
Withdrawal of energy subsidies and increase in domestic oil prices continue to fuel inflation at the moment. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is not willing to allow the continuation of subsidies and it also wants the government to further raise tax revenue which means petroleum development surcharge cannot be cut to moderate domestic fuel oil price hikes. 
The ongoing rupee depreciation, meanwhile, also keeps fueling inflation. In less than five months of this fiscal year, the rupee lost 11pc of its value falling to 175.23 to the US dollar on Nov 19 from 157.76 on June 30, as imports continued growing too fast expanding the current account deficit in the process. In four months of the fiscal year, the C/A deficit surged to $5.084 billion from $1.313bn in the same period of the last year, according to the latest balance of payments report. 
A full dose of monetary tightening of 150bps is expected to contain inflationary pressures by suppressing demand which would ultimately depress growth momentum and may even affect job creation. But then, the economic stabilisation that the central bank wants to achieve through monetary tightening — on the insistence of the IMF — had become necessary to contain the overheating economy. Why does Pakistan economy overheat so soon? In the present case, it is in the second year of strong recovery but in most cases, it is in less than five years and is a point to ponder.
Unless structural flaws of the economy are addressed adequately (which requires not only economic wisdom but also a strong political will and a governance structure free from the frequent intervention of non-democratic forces), sustainable economic growth would remain elusive.

14,Shifting away from TVs,Did the $1.5 million investment to stream the 2021 T20 World Cup pay off for Daraz?,"Signing an A-list star as the product’s brand ambassador isn’t enough to guarantee its success anymore. Social media is clearly the new king of marketing in this sector.
And for that matter, Daraz anticipated the traditional market structure to digitalise and understand the benefits of digital presence, as organisations are adopting quantitative and performance-based marketing strategies.
Alibaba-owned Daraz secured the ICC T20 World Cup 2021 streaming and provided free access to millions of cricket fans, hoping to earn $2 million from sponsorships alone during this year. Questions are raised on the strategy that aimed to go above and beyond both in terms of customer service and empowerment of the local community roaming projected to have a profound impact on the advertising sector.
“The reach of the viewership grew considerably from the first match till the semifinal. More than 12m people watched World Cup 2021 generating more than 345m views,” said Ammar Hassan, chief marketing officer at Daraz. “We hit a peak concurrent app-only. Since this was app-only broadcasting hence it does not have our web numbers,” he added.
As the initiative brought some interesting statics related to sports rating of different channels, for instance, PTV Sports and Ten Sports’ ratings for Pakistan vs. India match at the 2016 ICC WC T20 were 19.63 and 10.39, however, the ratings for the same contest at the ICC Men’s T20 WC 2021 were 18.7, and 6.1.

Did the $1.5 million investment to stream the 2021 T20 World Cup pay off for Daraz?

Given the A sports rating for tournaments were only 5.2 per cent higher than Ten Sports’ cumulative ratings for matches in the six matches preceding that, and assuming that Ten Sports’ ratings in 2016 were comparable to A Sports’ ratings in the same year, channels have seen a decline in ratings. Could it be attributed to Daraz Live and the matches being televisual on three channels rather than two?
According to media planners who presented the data, audiences who were TV-based in 2016 are becoming mobile-oriented. A big percentage of sports events enthusiasts (in their mid-30s) are predominantly mobile addicted.
“TV is still huge in Pakistan in terms of audience reach. We as a brand also still advertise on TV and find it effective. It depends on which product category your brand belongs to and what is your target audience. For us, our digital spends are bigger than offline marketing spends which might not be true for other brands,” said Mr Hassan. “We are a platform of more than 20m plus active users, which means that our reach might be equal or greater to some of the top tier TV channels as well.”
Speaking about the digital media importance he said: “With the advent of local manufacturing of smartphones, for many, their first date with the internet will happen through their mobile. I see a very fast pace shift of advertising towards digital coming in 5 – 10 years which will compete TV.”
Daraz is investing in content to guarantee that users have more than one reason to download and use the app. Daraz marketed well. The catch was the free live matches but did it get dodged as there are multiple platforms that streamed the tournament without buying the rights?
As reported, Daraz paid GroupM Pakistan around $1.5m for the online streaming of said matches and secured a net profit in excess of 30pc trying to handle the venture with the same lens as Alibaba Group’s Tmall.
“Feedback from clients was overwhelming. We had the advantage of flexibility. The investment in T20 digital rights proved to be apt as it paid well besides spike in brand recognition” said Mr Hassan.
One of the most interesting aspects of this venture is the disclosure that consumers who are watching the game would be provided contextual advertisements for appropriate products which can affect the bottom line stats of advertisers.
