Regional army spokesman Major Dieudonne Kasereka said that  “at around 2am, the camp of the Chinese group was attacked by armed bandits” in the village of Mukera in Fizi territory of South Kivu province.
“There were 14 in total, five were taken away by the attackers to an unknown destination,” he said, adding that the other nine were safely evacuated.
Colonel David Epanga, head of the armed forces in Fizi, said one policeman was killed and another was wounded in the attack.
The five abducted Chinese workers were employees of a company that has been operating a gold mine in the area for four to five months, Fizi civil society head Lusambya Wanumbe said.
“The company had difficulties starting its activities because of protests by the population which accused it of not respecting the rules,” Wanumbe said.
In August, South Kivu authorities suspended the work of half a dozen Chinese-financed companies, after residents accused them of mining for gold without permission and wrecking the environment.
In neighbouring North Kivu, the Congolese Institute for the Conservation of Nature (ICCN) said that suspected rebels linked to the M23 movement killed a guard in Virunga National Park on Saturday night.
The ICCN said the attack was  “carried out by around a hundred heavily armed individuals” near the village of Bukima, in the Mikeno area.
“The presumed perpetrators are former M23 members gathered on the Rwandan and Ugandan borders, who are seeking to establish bases on the territory of the Virunga National Park,” the ICCN said in a statement on Sunday.
The M23 is one of more than 120 armed groups which roam eastern Democratic Republic of Congo — a legacy of regional wars more than two decades ago.
It is a Congolese Tutsi group that was largely defeated in 2013 after launching a rebellion.

1,Opposition takes part in Venezuela vote watched by foreign observers,"CARACAS: With opposition parties participating for the first time since 2017 and European Union observers returning,...","CARACAS: With opposition parties participating for the first time since 2017 and European Union observers returning, Venezuela’s Sunday elections represent an early contest for power between the government and rivals in a country mired in economic crisis.
An estimated 21 million Venezuelans will be going to the polls to elect 23 state governors, as well as the mayors and council members of hundreds of cities.
Polling stations opened at 6am for 12 hours, with results expected around  “two or three in the morning,” a source with the National Electoral Council said. Lines formed early.
“I’ve come to exercise my right to vote in a democratic country,” 74-year-old Jose Casanova, a militant leftist, said after casting his ballot in a working-class neighborhood in eastern Caracas.
He considers Venezuela  “a blessed country despite all its problems.” Leftist President Nicolas Maduro, whose deeply controversial presidency has left the South American nation facing punishing economic sanctions, has been seeking a measure of relief through careful shows of goodwill and democratic intention. 
The opposition, which had boycotted elections for the past three years saying they were neither free nor fair, agreed to take part in Sunday’s votes after receiving assurances from the government.
Opposition leaders hope to raise their profile and gain momentum ahead of presidential elections set for 2024.
But there seems little doubt about the outcome: experts predict the Chavist movement that Maduro has led since the death of President Hugo Chavez in 2013 should easily prevail over a divided opposition.
Henrique Capriles, who lost presidential elections both to Chavez in 2012 and to Maduro a year later, said the opposition’s division will undeniably weigh on it.
“Let’s be honest,” he said:  “The PSUV (the governing Socialist Party) is going to win.” Observers say the opposition stands to win in six states at most: Tachira, Zulia, Lara, Nueva Esparta, Sucre and Anzoategui.
Caracas seeks a loosening of economic sanctions — notably from the United States, which does not recognize Maduro’s presidency — hoping at least for a partial lifting of the measures, said Oswaldo Ramirez, a consultant.
With hundreds of millions of dollars of its funds frozen abroad, Venezuela wants to be able to sell its petroleum more easily — the US historically is its biggest customer — and to end limits on imports.
The government has made a calculated series of concessions, opening negotiations with the opposition, and inviting election observers from the EU, the United Nations and the US-based Carter Center.
The EU is sending its first observer mission in 15 years, as Caracas — long prickly about its  “sovereignty” — has had to swallow its pride. “The regime needs this mission” to give its election credibility, one opposition member said.
After sitting out the 2018 presidential election and 2020 legislative votes, the opposition dropped its boycott strategy but has failed to agree on candidate lists.

2,France says 5th Covid wave hitting at ‘lightning’ speed,"For now, the spike in infections has not led to a massive influx of Covid patients into hospitals.","PARIS: Fifth-wave  coronavirus infections in France are rising at an alarming rate, the  government reported on Sunday, with new daily Covid cases close to doubling  over the past week.
The seven-day average of new cases reached  17,153 on Saturday, up from 9,458 a week earlier, according to the  health authorities, an increase of 81 percent.
“The fifth wave is starting at lightning speed,” government spokesman Gabrial Attal told media.
The  latest seven-day increase is three times the average rise of cases  recorded over the previous three weeks, indicating an exponential  acceleration of infections.
For now the spike in infections has  not led to a massive influx of Covid patients into hospitals, with the  authorities attributing the limited number of intensive care patients to  France’s high rate of vaccinations which appear highly effective  against the most dangerous forms of Covid. On Saturday, hospitals reported a total of 7,974 Covid patients in their care, with 1,333 of them in intensive treatment. This compares to 6,500 and 1,000, respectively, a month earlier.
“There  is a very strong increase in infections, but we also know that in  France we have a very large vaccination cover,” he said.  “We seem to be  ahead of our neighbours concerning booster shots.” France’s  introduction of a health pass ahead of other countries in the summer was  also helping to keep Covid in check, he said.
The health pass,  required in French restaurants, cafes and many cultural venues,  certifies that a person is fully vaccinated, has recently recovered from  Covid, or has tested negative for the virus.
The government  continues to stand by its choice to  “bring the weight of restrictions  to bear on non-vaccinated people rather than vaccinated people”, Attal  said.
Dutch police said Sunday they have arrested 19 people over riots in The Hague after the country was rocked by a second night of violence over the government’s coronavirus measures.
Officers in riot gear charged hundreds of demonstrators who set fire to bicycles and an electric moped piled in the middle of a busy intersection on Saturday night. A water cannon put out the blaze.
“The police were also pelted with heavy fireworks and stones thrown from roofs,” the Hague police said in a statement.
“Officers made a total of 19 arrests for, among other things, insult.” Riot police in one incident dragged a woman from a passing car after the occupants shouted at police, and put her into a police van, correspondents witnessed.
Five police officers were injured during the unrest while a rock thrown by rioters smashed the window of a passing ambulance carrying a patient, police said.
Riots also erupted in the central  “Bible Belt” town of Urk and cities in southern Limburg province, while angry fans disrupted two football matches being played behind closed doors because of coronavirus rules, Dutch media said.

3,Sri Lanka ends farm chemical ban as organic drive fails,"The island country is in the grip of a severe economic crisis, with a lack of foreign exchange triggering shortages of goods.","COLOMBO: Sri Lanka abandoned its quest to become the world’s first completely organic farming nation on Sunday, announcing it would immediately lift an import ban on pesticides and other agricultural inputs.
The island country has been in the grip of a severe economic crisis, with a lack of foreign exchange triggering shortages of food, crude oil and other essential goods.
Authorities had already walked back restrictions on fertiliser imports last month for tea, the country’s main export earner.
But ahead of planned farmer protests in the capital, Sri Lanka’s agricultural ministry said it would end a broader ban on all agrochemicals including herbicides and pesticides.
“We will now allow chemical inputs that are urgently needed,” ministry secretary Udith Jayasinghe told the private News First TV network.
“Considering the need to ensure food security, we have taken this decision.” Vast tracts of farmland were abandoned after the import ban, first introduced in May.
Shortages have worsened in the past week, with prices for rice, vegetables and other market staples having doubled across Sri Lanka.
Supermarkets have also rationed rice sales, allowing only five kilograms (11 pounds) per customer.
Farmers’ organisations had planned to march on the national parliament in Colo­mbo on Friday to dem­and the import of essential chemicals to protect their crops.
President Gotabaya Rajapaksa had justified the import ban by saying he wanted to make Sri Lankan farming 100 percent organic.
The policy was introduced after a massive hit to the cash-strapped island’s economy in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, with tourism earnings and foreign worker remittances drastically falling.

4,15 drown in Myanmar during bid to reach pagoda,"Local resident says the causeway was not marked out clearly enough, making it hard to navigate.","YANGON: At least 15 people drowned on Sunday while crossing a flooded causeway in Myanmar to reach a Buddhist temple for a festival, rescue workers said.
The tragedy unfolded as thousands of worshippers tried to reach the Kyeik Hne pagoda, which lies on a rocky outcrop around three kilometres (two miles) off the coast near the town of Thanbyuzayat in southern Mon state.
Local officials said some died when they tried to cross the poorly marked causeway, which is only around four metres wide, while the tide was too high. “We normally allow the people to come at 6:30am but they would not listen to us and started trying to walk across too early,” local official Nai Sahai Eain said.
More drowned later when they were jostled from the crowded walkway into the sea.
Ko Kyaw Thu, an emergency responder from Thanbyuzayat, said that 15 bodies had been taken to hospital and three people were still missing. Local resident Nai Wona said the causeway was not marked out clearly enough, making it hard to navigate.

5,12-year-old girl’s marriage  causes stir in Iraq,The legal age for marriage in Iraq is 18 but can be lowered to 15 in cases of parental or judicial consent.,"BAGHDAD: An Iraqi court adjourned a hearing on Sunday to allow a man to formalise his religious marriage to a 12-year-old girl, according to a lawyer for the girl’s mother, who opposes the union.
Rights activists protested outside the Baghdad court with banners such as  “the marriage of minors is a crime against childhood”, while lawyer Marwan Obeidi said the case had been postponed until November 28.
The legal age for marriage in Iraq is 18 but can be lowered to 15 in cases of parental or judicial consent, according to charity Save the Children.
“Religious marriages are not permitted outside civil or religious courts but these types of marriages still happen regularly and can be formalised on the payment of a small fine,” it said in a recent report.
The mother, who refuses to be identified, said her daughter Israa had been  “raped” and that the girl’s father kidnapped her.
But a department of the interior ministry dealing with violence against women said in a statement that it had met with Israa, her father and husband, seen the religious contract, and said she had assured them she had not been coerced.
Child marriage is not uncommon in conservative and rural areas of Iraq, as well as in other Arab countries.

6,"Yemeni migrant dies in attempt to enter EU, buried in Poland",His grave is located alongside those of other migrants who have died in the border crisis that erupted this summer.,"BOHONIKI: On an overcast Sunday amid fields and forest, a few men from Poland’s small Muslim community laid to rest a Yemeni migrant who died of cold and fatigue while trying to cross into the European Union from Belarus.
After saying a prayer outside the old wooden mosque of the Polish border village of Bohoniki, the men transported the coffin to a cemetery located on a hill of pine trees.
Mustafa Mohammed Murshid al-Raymi, who died age 37, was buried in the presence of his brother and the Yemeni ambassador to Poland. His grave was located alongside those of other migrants who have died in the border crisis that erupted this summer.
“It’s an expression of our respect for and solidarity with this man who died in horrible conditions. It’s a real tragedy,” said burial attendee Ryszard Mozdabaiev, a Muslim who fled Crimea for Poland eight years ago.
“This is politics that despise people,” he said alongside friends from Crimea and Chechnya who were all well acquainted with the experience of being a migrant.
The tiny local Muslim community — mostly descendents of the Tatars whose presence in Poland’s northeast dates back to the 14th century — have taken it upon themselves to organise proper burials for the migrants who have died in the border crisis.
“I fear there will be more burials soon,” said Maciej Szczesnowicz, the local Muslim leader.
Caught in the middle
His community in Bohoniki has been helping the migrants on the border by collecting clothes and food and raising funds. They have also been lending a hand to troops in the area by cooking them soup every day. Polish media say at least 11 migrants have died since the crisis began.
Last week, Belarus cleared a makeshift border encampment, sending 2,000 migrants to a nearby logistics centre.
But Polish border guards report that migrants continue to try their luck at crossing the border.
The West accuses Belarus of creating the crisis by bringing in would-be migrants — mostly from the Middle East — and taking them to the border with promises of an easy crossing into the European Union.
Belarus has denied the claim, instead criticising the EU for not taking in the migrants.
Caught in the middle, migrants often report being forced to cross the border by Belarusian officials, before then being pushed back into Belarus by Polish authorities.
Yemen’s foreign ministry said Saturday it was working on bringing back its citizens from the border, including eight on the Belarusian side and nine in Poland.

Srikesh Kumar was rushed to a clinic in a critical condition after he was hit by a motorbike in Moradabad, east of the capital New Delhi.
He was transported to a private medical facility where he was declared dead on arrival by the doctor, and then transported to a government hospital for post-mortem on Friday.
“The emergency medical officer examined him. He did not find any signs of life and hence declared him dead,” Rajendra Kumar, the hospital’s medical superintendent, said on Sunday. The doctor said police were informed and the body was placed in the morgue freezer until his family arrived six hours later.
“When a police team and his family came over to initiate the paperwork for the autopsy, he was found alive,” he added.
Rajendra Kumar said the 45-year-old was undergoing further treatment but was still in a coma. “This is nothing short of a miracle,” he added.
An investigation was under way to determine how the doctors mistakenly declared him dead.

8,Rare Einstein manuscript set  to fetch millions,"“This is without a doubt the most valuable Einstein manuscript ever to come to auction,” Christie’s said in a statement.","PARIS: A rare manuscript by theoretical physicist Albert Einstein goes under the hammer in Paris on Tuesday, with auctioneers aiming for a stratospheric price tag. The manuscript, containing preparatory work for Einstein’s key achievement the theory of relativity, is estimated at between two and three million euros (2.3-3.4 million), according to Christie’s which is hosting the sale on behalf of the Aguttes auction house.
“This is without a doubt the most valuable Einstein manuscript ever to come to auction,” Christie’s said in a statement.
The 54-page document was handwritten in 1913 and 1914 in Zurich, Switzerland, by Einstein and his colleague and confidant, Swiss engineer Michele Besso.
Christie’s said it was thanks to Besso that the manuscript was preserved for posterity. This was  “almost like a miracle” since the German-born genius himself would have been unlikely to hold on to what he considered to be a simple working document, Christie’s said.
Today, the paper offers  “a fascinating plunge into the the mind of the 20th century’s greatest scientist”, it said.
Einstein, who died in 1955 aged 76 and is considered to be one of the greatest physicists ever, revolutionised his field with the theory of relativity and made major contributions to quantum mechanics theory.
He won he Nobel physics prize in 1921 and was later adopted by pop culture as a genius scientist icon, helped by his trademark unruly hair, moustache and bushy eyebrows.

9,"UK probes bias in medical devices after high Covid toll among Blacks, Asians","Britain has recorded more than 143,000 coronavirus deaths, the highest total in Europe after Russia.","LONDON: The British government is investigating whether built-in racial bias in some medical devices led to Black and Asian people getting sick and dying disproportionately from Covid-19. 
Health Secretary Sajid Javid said on Sunday that the pandemic had highlighted health disparities along race and gender lines. He said that a third of intensive care admissions in Britain at the height of the pandemic were people from Black and ethnic minority backgrounds, more than double their share of the population. 
Britain’s statistics office has found that in the first year of the pandemic, up to March 2021, Black and South Asian people in the UK had higher death rates than their white compatriots, even after factors like occupation and underlying health conditions were taken into account. 
Javid said one issue was research showing that pulse oximeters, which measure blood oxygen levels through the skin, work less well on darker skin. He called it a systemic worldwide issue. 
“Now, I’m not saying this was deliberate by anyone, I think it’s just, it’s a systemic issue potentially, with medical devices and it may go even further than that with medical textbooks, for example,” Javid told Sky News. 
Writing in the Sunday Times, he said the possibility that a bias, even an inadvertent one, could lead to a poorer health outcome, was totally unacceptable. 
He said he hoped to work with his US counterpart, Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, and officials in other countries, to eliminate bias in the health system. 
He said a UK review, which would also look at gender bias, would report its findings by the end of January. 
Britain has recorded more than 143,000 coronavirus deaths, the highest total in Europe after Russia. 
Europe is currently the only part of the world where Covid-19 cases are rising, and many countries are reintroducing restrictions to fight the surge. Austria will enter a nationwide lockdown on Monday (today), and violent protests erupted in the Netherlands this weekend after the government said it would restrict access for unvaccinated people to some venues. 
In the UK, however, cases are broadly flat and deaths and hospitalisations are slowly declining. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said this week that he saw no need to move to the government’s winter Plan B, in which people would be required to wear masks indoors and advised to work from home. 
Britain had higher infection rates than its neighbours for several months, and some scientists say that puts the country in a better position now. 
Linda Bauld, a professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, said the UK had been dealing with the highly transmissible delta variant of the virus longer than its European neighbours, and “because we’ve had high infections in the past, we’ve probably a bit more natural immunity in the population. Britain is also now rolling out booster vaccine doses to everyone 40 and up”. 
Oxford University professor of medicine John Bell said he didn’t think the UK would face another Christmas lockdown, as it did last year. 
“My advice is, order that turkey, because it’ll all be fine,” he told Times Radio. But, he added, “if you’re planning a skiing holiday in Austria, things may not go so well”.

10,China downgrades diplomatic ties with Lithuania over Taiwan,"BEIJING: China has officially downgraded diplomatic ties with Lithuania, the foreign ministry in Beijing said on...","BEIJING: China has officially downgraded diplomatic ties with Lithuania, the foreign ministry in Beijing said on Sunday, after Taiwan established a de facto embassy in Vilnius.
“The Chinese government had to lower diplomatic relations between the two countries... to safeguard its sovereignty and the basic norms of international relations,” the ministry said in a statement announcing the downgrade to the charge d’affaires level. “The Lithuanian government must bear all consequences that arise from this.” It added that Lithuania had  “abandoned the political commitment made upon the establishment of diplomatic relations” with China. It was a reference to the  “One China” policy, under which countries officially recognise Beijing over Taipei. Lithuania’s foreign ministry on Sunday said it regretted China’s decision.
“Lithuania reaffirms its adherence to the ‘One China’ policy, but at the same time has the right to expand cooperation with Taiwan,” the ministry said in a statement.
Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte stressed that Taiwan’s office in Vilnius does not have diplomatic status.
“The fact that Lithuania wants to intensify economic, cultural or scientific ties with Taiwan was announced in our government’s programme, so our move should not be very surprising,” she told reporters. Chinese state broadcaster CCTV called the move a  “solemn warning against the crude provocation of China’s core interests”.

11,Star-studded roster of advisers could not stop Chishti’s fall,Former finance minister Hafeez Shaikh is one of the six people still on the board of directors of the Afiniti group.,"WASHINGTON: Former finance minister Hafeez Shaikh is one of the six people still on the board of directors of the Afiniti group whose founder Zia Chishti had to exit the company earlier this week after a sex scandal.
Other members include Jose Maria Aznar, the sixth president of Spain and John Snow, the 73rd US Treasury Secretary. Chishti spent more than a decade building Afiniti and assembled a star-studded roster of advisers -- three former heads of government, including former British Prime Minister David Cameron, and a former US military chief Admiral Mike Mullen.
Cameron, however, quit the board this week, saying that he was not aware of the sexual allegations against Chishti when he joined the firm. Chishti also hired a high-powered sales force that featured a member of the British royal family and a great-grandson of Winston Churchill.
Chishti, who led two billion-dollar companies before he was forced out, previously invented a dental brace Invisalign and launched braces business that is now worth $47 billion.
Chishti was born in Maine, US, in 1971 to a Pakistani mother and an American father. After his father’s death in 1974, he and his mother moved to Lahore. After graduating from the Lahore American School, he returned to the United States and did a BA in computer science and economics from Columbia University, New York, and MBA from Stanford.
Chishti’s sudden fall from grace began on Nov 16 when a former employee of one of his firms, Afiniti, appeared before the House Judiciary Committee and claimed during a publicly televised hearing that Chishti sexually and physically assaulted her soon after she joined the company.
She also stated that the company used internal arbitration to force her not to share her ordeal with the media. Spottiswoode also shared images of her neck and face, showing marks caused by an alleged attack.
The hearing brought together seven witnesses to testify on “how forced arbitration keeps victims of sexual violence and sexual harassment in the shadows”. The committee’s chair Jerry Nadler is working on legislation that would ban the use of forced arbitration in cases of alleged sexual violence and harassment.
One of the witnesses, Eliza Dushku, who worked at CBS, also presented a copy of an article she wrote for the Boston Globe, describing how “I did not want to be sexually harassed. I was fired”.
Another witness, Andowah A. Newton, a legal executive with over 20 years’ experience, spoke about how even legal expertise and degrees from Cornell, Georgetown and Sorbonne failed to protect her. “None of my achievements has protected me from the years of intense retaliation, dehumanisation, and degradation” caused by forced arbitration, she told the committee.
But none were as effective as Spottiswoode. She described how she first met Chishti when she was 12 or 13. “He was a business associate and friend of my father’s,” she said, adding that her father owned Afiniti stock and believed that he and his wife would retire “very comfortably” from the stock.
“When I was in my senior year of college in December 2014, Chishti, who was 43, invited me on a ski trip … but the trip was disguised to groom me,” she told the committee.
Spottiswoode said that after Chishti pursued her for nine months, she agreed to date him but left him after spending some time together.
Months later, Chishti encouraged her to join his company, presenting “a rosy picture of a great career opportunity. Naively, I believed him” after Chishti assured her that he did not expect sexual favours in return.
In April 2016, Spottiswoode signed a contract with Afiniti that included an arbitration with a strong confidentiality clause, which she did not fully understand.
As Spottiswoode started working for the company, she said she realised that Chishti was “not willing to treat me as an employee”.
“Instead, over the next 18 months, he oscillated between pressuring me for sex and punishing me. When I rebuffed him, he humiliated me in front of co-workers and then ignored me completely, causing me to fear for my job,” she told the committee.
Spottiswoode, now a Columbia University law student and friend of Chishti’s daughter, said during a work trip to Brazil Chishti allegedly forced her to have sex with him again.
“I felt completely trapped and hopeless. … I didn’t want to lose my job, … I did not feel that anyone would protect me, and I was too tired to argue with him anymore. I went to his room where he beat me while having sex with me.
“I told him he was hurting me, he said: ‘Good.’ He told me he should have had sex with me when we first met, when I was 13 years old.”
Earlier this week, Afiniti’s Board of Directors announced that Zia Chishti had “stepped down from his role as Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and Director of Afiniti, effective immediately.”
The Board will make additional organisational announcements in the coming days.
Chishti has rejected the charges as false.

suspect Kenny Wells

 
ATLANTA: A passenger awaiting a search at the Atlanta airport’s main security checkpoint reached in his bag and grabbed a firearm, and it went off, causing chaos among travellers and prompting a temporary ground stop on flights on Saturday afternoon, officials said. The man fled.
The man, later identified as a convicted felon, ran with the gun from the checkpoint and escaped out an airport exit, the Transportation Security Administration said. Authorities said it was not an active shooter incident and described the discharge as accidental.
Police said later they had issued a warrant for the arrest of the passenger, 42-year-old Kenny Wells.
The airport’s police commander, Maj. Reginald Moorman, said Wells was being sought on charges including carrying a concealed weapon at a commercial airport, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, discharging a firearm and reckless conduct.
We are actively pursuing this individual as we speak, Moorman said at a news briefing Saturday evening with TSA and airport officials.
The discharge caused a frenzy on social media as alarmed travelers posted videos to Twitter and other sites showing and describing moments of chaos and confusion at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, one of the nation’s busiest.
Authorities said three people suffered minor injuries, including one person who fell in the airport’s atrium area away from the checkpoint, and two complaining of shortness of breath. Police said they had to work crowd control until things calmed.
A TSA official said no one was shot.
We were fortunate that when the firearm went off, no one was seriously injured,” Robert Spinden, the TSA’s director of federal security for Georgia, said at the airport briefing. Officials didn’t immediately disclose the type of weapon involved.
Social media users reported there were long lines afterward and missed flights for some. The incident came ahead of the peak Thanksgiving holiday travel season as people are still coping with the concerns of safely traveling during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.
Although the FAA ordered a temporary ground stop, airport officials said operations never ceased and the airport didn’t close. They said the airport returned to normal operations in under two hours.
The TSA statement said it all began when the passenger was about to undergo a bag search by an official at 1:30pm at the airport’s main checkpoint after an X-ray scan detected what was described as a prohibited item.” He advised the passenger not to touch the property, and as he opened the compartment containing the prohibited item, the passenger lunged into the bag and grabbed a firearm, at which point it discharged. The passenger then fled the area,” according to the statement.
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported social media users rushed from the airport in the chaos after hearing the gun going off. One video posted on Twitter showed people running out of the terminal, some anxiously glancing back.
After Atlanta police gave the all-clear normal operations resumed at the airport before 3:30pm TSA said all passengers had to be re-screened.
The TSA said the incident underscores the importance for all passengers of checking personal belongings for dangerous items before leaving for the airport. Passengers caught with firearms at airport checkpoints face a civil penalty. The TSA says firearms may be allowed in checked baggage when they are unloaded and packed in a locked, hard-sided case.
Last month, federal officials reported a spike in firearm seizures at Atlanta’s airport part of a record year for the number of guns detected at airport security checkpoints.
The TSA said it seized 391 firearms at Hartsfield-Jackson airport in the first nine months of 2021. That was up from 220 last year when passenger counts were down significantly because of the pandemic. But it also was a big jump from 2019, when 323 firearms were seized in Atlanta.
Across the nation, the TSA said, it had stopped 4,495 airline passengers from carrying firearms onto their flights by Oct 3 of this year, surpassing the previous record of 4,432 firearms caught at checkpoints in all of 2019.
The agency’s news release last month noted the record came despite a continued dip in passengers because of the pandemic. Authorities did not offer an explanation or theory about the spike in gun seizures.
Hartsfield-Jackson is one of the nations busiest airports, though other US airports rival its passenger screening numbers. Dallas Forth Worth International Airport was second on the TSAs list, with 232 firearms seized by Oct 3.
