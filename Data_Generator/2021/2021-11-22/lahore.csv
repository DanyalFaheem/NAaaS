The PML-N senior vice president also questioned why the NAB laws did not apply to the judiciary, army, bureaucracy and businessmen but only politicians. He was a keynote speaker at the Asma Jahangir Conference’s session ‘Right to dissent – the laws of accountability’ here on Sunday. Veteran journalist Rashid Rehman moderated the session.
Mr Abbasi spoke at length on NAB’s performance, trial of politicians (by it), flaws in its laws and its functioning with regard to selective accountability.
“I want to ask why the NAB laws do not apply to the judiciary, army, bureaucracy and businessmen but only politicians. Subsequently, politicians’ media trials are held based on NAB action. The NAB chairman should tell how much recovery has been made from politicians and how many of them have been convicted since its inception 21 years ago. Only one politician (Nawaz Sharif) has been convicted in 21 years of NAB’s accountability,” he deplored.
“NAB is the most corrupt institution in the country. It is an institution of political engineering. It is used to make turncoats. Some 80 per cent politicians never have the power to spend public money. Will someone tell how the NAB applies to them?” he asked and also spoke about the modus operandi of the anti-graft body.
“NAB first declares you (a suspect) guilty… and then you have to prove your innocence. Does anybody care about such people who face NAB’s allegations and what their families go through meanwhile?” he asked.
Mr Abbasi reminded NAB that ‘according to the law one has to maintain a financial record (of business transactions) for seven years but it seeks the record of 35 years (from a suspect). “I am all for accountability but NAB is not for accountability but for political engineering, selective accountability and (political) victimisation. Those who impose taxes on the people of Pakistan should first give details of their own assets be answerable for their own lifestyles. Let us start with the president of Pakistan followed by the prime minister and the opposition leader,” he proposed, saying politicians went through an accountability process every five years in the form of a ballot.
The PML-N leader further said there were flaws in the NAB laws which should be amended through consensus. “When the opposition presents amendments to the NAB laws, the government makes noises about NRO,” he lambasted.
As for an amendment he proposed on appointing judges, Mr Abbasi said: “Anyone aspiring to become a judge should present his tax record of the past 10 years. Those (aspiring judges) who are unable to do so are either not technically qualified or have hidden their income… you see they have to judge us tomorrow.”
PTI Senator Ali Zafar focused on ‘kleptocracy’ (a reference to the Pakistani elite who stay in power through their wealth). “The biggest threat to our country is from kleptocrats. It is a cancer to our democracy. We need to fight this monster as kleptocrats propagate that the accountability is flawed… based on victimisation,” Mr Zafar said.
The PTI leader also talked about the ‘revolving door of politics’ in Pakistan in the1990s when Nawaz Sharif replaced Benazir Bhutto and vice versa. He said how Nawaz established Ehtesab Bureau to institute cases against the PPP leaders and subsequently both parties decided not to address
lacunae in NAB Ordinance (introduced by the Musharraf regime in 1999). “The PTI inherited these lacunae but let NAB touch kleptocrats,” he said.“NAB has structural flaws…it needs to separate investigation and prosecution departments,” he said and pledged the government would continue its accountability process.
PPP senior leader Qamar Zaman Kaira said no society could evolve only through making laws. “No law is more powerful than public opinion. The country needs to be run through the constitution and clarity,” he said.
Supreme Court’s Advocate Haider Rasul Mirza and Sindh High Court Bar Association president Salahuddin Ahmed also pinpointed flaws in NAB laws and suggested how to regulate the institution.

3,‘Musharraf institutionalised enforced disappearances’,Suggests that intelligence agencies should be brought under some legislation as a solution to the enforced disappearances.,"LAHORE: Former Senator Farhatullah Babar says enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings have been there since decades but they were institutionalised during the regime of Gen Pervez Musharraf who acknowledged in his book, In the Line of Fire: A Memoir, the people of Pakistan were hunted for the CIA against millions of dollars but no action was taken against Musharraf as the state agencies were involved in it.
“In 2018, we called the chairman of the commission on enforced disappearances to the Senate and he was asked many questions. When he was asked about the prosecution and investigation, he said the missing persons, after their return, would not want to pursue their cases,” Mr Babar said in a session “Rights of Detainees and Prisoners” on the second day of Asma Jahangir Conference here at a private hotel.
He said 153 army personnel had been identified and it was said that action was being taken against them but nothing practical was done. He added that in a statement of the ISPR, it was said that not all missing persons were in custody of the forces, in other words, admitting that at least some missing persons were in their custody.
“Akhtar Mengal had threatened not to vote for the budget unless missing persons from Balochistan were released and on his demand, 48 missing persons were set free. The question is who released them and the answer is the state agencies.”
Mr Babar lamented that the commission on enforced disappearance had failed because it had not been able to investigate even a single person involved in missing persons cases, let alone prosecute them. It claimed to have secured the release of 3,800 people but not even in one case, it had been able to investigate and prosecute those responsible, the senator added.
“The Senate committee asked the Balochistan government to give a list of the mutilated bodies found in the last two years. It gave the figure of 53 but no FIR was registered because the relatives did not want it, showing the distrust of people in the government.”
Mr Babar said more than 7,000 cases of enforced disappearances had been registered but not a single case was investigated because of the elephant in the room, which did not permit it. He suggested that the intelligence agencies should be brought under some legislation as solution to the enforced disappearances.
Advocate Shabbir Hussain Gigyani from Peshawar said since 2006 when the Talibanisation started, the people of tribal areas were deprived of their legal rights. The extrajudicial killing and enforced disappearances started in the areas started in 2008 when the army operation was launched and there was no legislation on it. In 2011, he added, the parliament gave a legal protection to the operation perhaps under the direction of the armed forces.
Mr Gigyani said making law was not a big deal but the enforcement of law was more important, which was an issue.
“The American public had protested against the Guantanamo Bay prison but there are even worse kind of detention centres in Pakistan in the areas of Lakki Marwant, Kohat, Peshawar and Khyber district where 8,000 people were being kept as per the report of the state,” he added.
Rights activist Amna Janjua described the ordeal after her husband went missing in 2005. She and her family are still waiting for his return while their questions go unanswered. The session was moderated by Saroop Ejaz.
ANTI-RAPE LAW
Senator Waleed Iqbal says that since he took over as the chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Human Rights, several laws have been taken up, including those on protection of the senior citizens, domestic violence, domestic workers and corporal punishment.
“Other than legislation, the committee has taken up the Noor Muqaddam case and Minar-i-Pakistan harassment incident. What I have learnt from these cases and the empirical evidence that it’s not severity of punishment that actually deters crimes, particularly of violence against women, it’s the certainty of the punishment that deters it when a perpetrator is aware is that the law will chase up after him and punish him,” said Mr Iqbal during a session on “Anti-Rape Legislation–Barriers to Implementation” at the Asma Jahangir Conference.
He said there was the Section 354-A of PPC addressing that kind of incidents like Minar-i-Pakistan and it prescribes death penalty and life imprisonment for the perpetrator.
“The section has been there since 1984 from the era of Gen Zial Haq but it did not deter crimes of this nature because there was no certainty of punishment.”
Mr Iqbal pointed out the victim-blaming, particularly of women, in the subcontinent due to a certain cultural mindset, which could be changed only through training and education.
“The male children in the family should be trained to respect women and the rule of the law.” The new anti-rape law would also face the same fate as the earlier legislation if there would be no certainty of punishment and change in the mindset, he added.
Nida Aly, the executive director of AGHS Legal Aid Cell, said there was no dearth of laws in Pakistan but their implementation was the issue.
“There was legislation on rape in 2016 and now a new law is being introduced but the question is whether the earlier law was implemented.”
She pointed out the lack of resources as a hurdle to implementation of laws.
“There were 34,000 rape cases registered but none of them was tried according the anti-rape law. When CCPO was asked why the anti-rape law was not followed, he replied there were no resources allocated for it, saying they needed Rs4.5bn to make infrastructure for investigation centres and Rs1.5bn to run them.”
Assistant Inspector General of Police Maria Mehmood and former chairperson of Punjab Commission on Status of Women Fauzia Viqar also spoke.

4,Punjab Notes: Dog and dog’s life: rewarding loyalty?,Man’s relationship with dog in our region has contradictory nature. Whether one is a Hindu or a Muslim or a Sikh...,"Man’s relationship with dog in our region has contradictory nature. Whether one is a Hindu or a Muslim or a Sikh for example, one’s attitude towards the dog is ambivalent, to say the least.
The history of the relationship is mired in the confusing notions of faith, spirituality and utilitarian culture. It’s one of the earliest animals domesticated by humans if we look at the evolution of human society. It’s generally considered either to be polluting or impure. The former in the Hindu religious culture and the latter in the Muslim religious culture. The earliest mention of dog is found in the Rig-Veda [composed/revealed in the Punjab, 1500 BC]. It’s in fact a bitch called Sarama that traces for Vedic god Indra the cows stolen and kept hidden in a cave by Pani, one of the prominent Harappa tribes demonised by Vedic Aryans for their resistance.
In the post-Vedic times, the famous epic Mahabharata tells us quite a few stories about dog and its complicated relationship with our ancient society. “When Janamejaya and his brothers were performing a sacrifice, a dog, son of the bitch Sarama, came near. The brothers beat the dog, who ran howling back to his mother and told her that they had beaten him though he had neither looked at nor licked the offerings. Sarama then went to the sacrificial grounds and said to Janamejaya, ‘since you beat my son when he had done nothing wrong, danger will befall you when you do not see it coming (translation; Wendy Doniger)”. Janamejaya, a Kuru king, as a result is bitten by a snake.
Manu also warns kings to be on their guard against dogs who could pollute the oblations by licking them. Contrary to treatment meted out to it here, there are other stories where the dog is rewarded for its loyalty. Mythical king Yudhishthira for example refuses to forsake his loyal dog because he cannot enter heaven without the dog who is devoted to him.
Some scholars think that dog in Indian mythology in some way also symbolically represents the marginalised; pariah and women.
In Muslim culture the clergy and the conservative treat dog as ‘Najas/ Paleet’, impure and filthy, not only to be undeserving of being a pet but also to be avoided for its polluting touch. Angels do not visit the house that has a dog, they declare. But at the same time we read in the Quran the story of As’haab e Kaaf [fellows of Kaaf] who slept in a cave for centuries with their dog and when woke up found the world unrecognisably changed. We find no adverse remark about the dog in the story. So an ambivalence regarding dog is found in both the religious communities despite the difference in their worldviews. Dog’s bad luck!
Dog has been an inseparable part of Punjab’s countryside and agrarian society spanning over thousands of years. It’s feared but loved more for what it can do for humans. For being small units with low density population villages are vulnerable to theft attacks and burglary. It is dogs who guard the houses and keep the intruders at bay with their nightly vigils. They also keep watch at pens and cattle sheds. They can be nastier than the nasty hustlers. During the day time dogs mind the herds and do not let them go astray. A line from folklore hints at long companionship of man and dog; “uth way kuttiya, jungle suttiya, jungle paee ladaai [Get up you sleeping dog/ strife has surfaced in the jungle]. It perhaps vaguely alludes to our coming out of primeval forests as a result of chaotic situation developed over there at some point in time in the distant past.
In our classical literature we find dog mentioned several times in the poetry of urbanite Madho Lal Husain [sixteenth century]. In his verses it stands for negative significance. “Dhund purani kuttiyan lukki, sraovar maanh dhuityasey [The dogs licked the stagnant pool /we washed ourselves in the fresh water stream]”. In another verse he says:”jis nagri Thakur jass nahi, so kaakar kookar basti hai [The town where one doesn’t hear the hymn, is the abode of crows and dogs]”. The meanings are abundantly clear. May be the poet has visceral dislike for pariah dog because of his urban upbringing. He is otherwise full of empathy and compassion.
Poet Khawja Farid likens himself to a loyal dog at the Lords’ door. When legendary Heer after her forced marriage spends time with Ranjha, her lover, in the garden, her friends celebrating the amorous encounter say: “Kherey Kabuli kuttian vaang ethey, wadhva ke kunn te dumb gae [Like Kabuli dogs the Khera ran away after having their nose and tail clipped]. Khera, the in-laws of Heer, are like Kabuli dogs who are known for being ferocious and nasty.
Bulleh Shah, the relentless defender of the defenseless, is the only one who dares to place dogs a few notches higher than most of men in his short poem “kuttey”: “You stay up all night to pray / but dogs are sleepless too /they are better than you / they will not leave their master’s house /though beaten black and blue/ they are better than you [trans: Taufiq Rafat]”.
In almost all cultures dog has been/is treated unfairly despite its loyalty to and love for humans. Just look at English language. It’s large number of phrases that demean dog. In our language we have similar expressions; kuttia kuttia hovan [ to be mistreated like a dog], kuttey di nasal [offspring of miserable/ filthy parents], Kuttey di maar [ born of a dog], kuttey vaang loor loor phiran [ to fool around like a dog], Kuttey khussi karan [ to castrate dogs/ it means doing most useless things] and innumerable other such phrases. You can seriously offend a man by calling him a dog. But if you call a woman a bitch [kutti], you would land in far more serious trouble. We humans have a disease called selfishness. Our care or love for an animal is proportionate to its utility for us. We are rigidly anthropocentric when it comes to animals. A dog is good as long as it barks at what we hate, the moment it barks at us, it’s nasty. And we can be nastier when animals are nasty. After all we animals with a developed brain. — soofi01@hotmail.com

5,Panel demands functional student unions on campuses,LAHORE: The participants of the session on ‘Young and fearless: students rights’ demanded that student unions ...,"LAHORE: The participants of the session on ‘Young and fearless: students rights’ demanded that student unions and freedom of speech be allowed on campuses. Ammar Ali Jan moderated the session on Sunday.
Baloch Student Organisation (BSO) leader Sadia Baloch said the students of Balochistan were holding a sit-in in Quetta about the kidnapping of their two activists - Faseeh and Sohail - who were abducted from their hostel.
She said the university administration had not responded to them about the whereabouts of two missing students as the CCTV cameras installed on the campus were closed. “We will continue sit-in till the recovery of students,” she said.
She said the state had turned middle and high schools and universities into army camps and students were being picked up from hostels.
She said the media was also playing the role of silent spectators on missing persons and extrajudicial killings in Balochistan. “When we approached the authorities to raise our voices they termed the killings a mistake,” she said.
She said they would continue to resist against state brutalities. She said the BSO had been banned and it was working under pseudo names.
Sindhu Nawaz Ghanghro said the students who raised voice for their issues were being harassed, tortured and later kidnapped.
She said two of their comrades were picked up when they organised a student right march last year.
Jamaima Afridi said the students in their areas were suffering as the state was not giving internet facilities in the former Fata areas.
She said it was a lie that the districts were mainstreamed after the merger as the jigras were fully operating and running state businesses.
Muzzamil Kakar said students from Pata had been deprived of scholarships and the government was not listening to them.
He said the government was holding dialogue with terrorists, but it registered terrorism cases against students who demanded their rights.
Muqdas Jarral alleged female students were facing harassment by the administration and teachers.
She said educational institutions had banned girls from holding study circles.
Ali Abdullah, Wrranga Loni and Zaigham Abbas also spoke.

This was a consensus among the panelists at a session at the Asma Jahangir Conference, entitled ‘Mainstreaming Gender Equality in the Judiciary’ held at a local hotel here on Sunday.
The moderator, Barrister Waqqas Mir, opened the session by asking senior lawyer and a member of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan Advocate Akhtar Hussain that was it even a priority of the state to address the issue? Replying to the question, Advocate Hussain said gender equality was a larger issue that was not confined to the judiciary and it had roots in the feudal traditions. He regretted that women were also nor properly represented in the bars.
International Commission of Jurists’ legal adviser for South Asia Reema Omer said women’s near absence in the judiciary was a crisis for the country’s democracy as well. She said it was an issue of a particular mindset that there were no women judges in the higher judiciary.
Citing example of South Africa, she said the country introduced radical changes to its constitution in 1996 by including the principle in it that ‘Diversity is part of the merit’. “Women bring their own approach and experience to an institution that changes its character,” Ms Omer said, adding that because of 1996 constitutional amendments, the women’s representation had reached 30 percent in South Africa’s judiciary.
She said to improve women’s representation in the higher judiciary there should be transparency in the criteria for appointment of judges. She regretted that the Judicial Commission comprises all male judges who might have a tendency to favour their gender while making appointments.
She also agreed that besides constitutional and legal amendments, there was a dire need for massive social change to address the issue.
Sindh High Court Bar Association president Salahuddin Ahmed said there was a systematic discrimination against women in society that needed to be eliminated. He said the problem started at the entry level as a lesser number of women entered the legal profession that was largely considered not suitable for women. He said this discrimination was also reflected in the culture of bars. He said there was a ‘locker room’ type environment in barrooms where women lawyers felt uncomfortable. He also stressed the need for ethnic and class diversity in the judiciary that should reflect the entire population. Mr Ahmed said the arbitrariness in the criteria for the judges’ appointment system should be ended.
Nida Usman Chaudhry, the founder of Women in Law and Learn. pk, regretted that usually the onus for their poor participation in different fields is shifted to women themselves, without addressing the issues that hamper their growth. Condemning the bias prevalent against women candidates in bar elections, she mentioned no woman got elected to the Punjab Bar Council in 2020 poll.
To a question by the moderator regarding his role as a member of Judicial Commission, Advocate Akhtar Hussain deplored that bar council’s voice was not heard there and it was dominated by the judges. He also rapped the role played by biradari (caste and clan) in the bars politics and even in the judges appointment.

This was the consensus among the speakers at a session “Impact of Extremism on Religious and Sectarian Minorities” on the concluding day (Sunday) of Asma Jahangir Conference – 2021.
The well-attended session at Avari’s Khorshed Mahal was moderated by academic Pervez Hoodbhoy who at the outset highlighted the minorities’ plight which had its roots in the two-nation theory and the Objectives Resolution and how the very definition of the word was changed in 1974. He also spoke about the Hazara – the “double minority who had been systematically discriminated against” in Pakistan.
Lal Chand Malli, an MNA from Sindh’s Umerkot city, dilated on the impact of extremism and discrimination against the minorities who love the land they live in. “The Quaid-i-Azam encouraged us to live here and we are admirers of the Constitution of Pakistan,” he said. He also spoke about the efforts of the government which made a parliamentary committee to protect minorities against forced conversions and how the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) scuttled the initiative.
The minorities could renovate their worship places but could not build a new one, he bemoaned.
“Temples and mosques are mere buildings and can be built and rebuilt but hearts once broken cannot be mended,” was Mr Malli’s moving remark which won him applause.
Human Rights Commission of Pakistan Secretary General Harris Khalique said there was “confusion” as to what the country should look like. “The Quaid-i-Azam spoke about inclusion and exclusion at the same time. He delivered a speech underscoring the need for safeguarding the rights of the minorities as equal citizens of Pakistan and also spoke on several occasions about the country being a laboratory where Islam would be experimented,” he said. The situation, he said, was a continuation of communalism problem in India.
Hazara community’s Jalila Haider, a human rights attorney, emphatically described how the state emboldened the extremists who subjected the minorities to heinous violations. “Those in the saddle even denigrate the protesters mourning the loss of dear ones,” she said.
“Every one claims there is justice in the country but where is justice,” she asked while holding back her tears.
Another panellist, Kulpana Devi, additional advocate general, Sindh High Court, regretted that the issue of forced conversions (of Hindu girls) had assumed an alarming proportion. Describing her association with the country, she said: “I am from the land of the Sufis. I have not migrated and am a proud Sindhi. I belong to the land of the founders of Pakistan and its constitution.”
Qamar Suleman, a member of Jamat-e-Ahmadiyya, vehemently spoke about how the government had failed to fulfill its obligations of ensuring citizens’ fundamental rights such as protection, health and education. He stressed the need for the civil society to stand up and be counted.

The MWM made the announcement in a joint press conference which was attended by PPP senior leaders Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, Nayyar Hussain Bokhari, Aslam Gill and Hasan Murtaza, MWM’s Allama Abdul Khaliq, Khurram Naqvi and Hasan Kazmi here.
Former premier Raja Pervaiz Ashraf said PPP was the only party which was standing in the face of growing extremism.
He said the PPP workers in Lahore and the constituency had been charged and it would perform well in NA-133.
Nayyar Bokhari said the PPP and MWM should contest elections together. “After the Dec 5 by-poll the leadership of both parties should sit together for future alliance,” he said and added the NA-133 was not the property of any party.
The MWM leaders said its voters would get Aslam Gill elected from the constituency. The NA-133 seat had fallen vacant after the death of PML-N MNA Parvaiz Malik and the party now nominated his wife Shaista Parvaiz Malik to contest for the constituency.
Meanwhile, the PML-N held a rally in NA-133.
Speaking on the occasion, retired Capt Safdar said that on Dec 5 the voters of the NA-133 would give the message ‘stop stealing votes’.

9,‘Rejection of forced conversion bill has emboldened perpetrators’,"LAHORE: Forced marriage isn’t just making someone enter into a marriage, but when one cannot the exit the marriage...","LAHORE: Forced marriage isn’t just making someone enter into a marriage, but when one cannot the exit the marriage is equally forced, stated Shirkat Gah Executive Director Farida Shaheed at the session, ‘Minorities under threat -- forced conversions and marriages’, on the concluding day of the third Asma Jahangir Conference on Sunday.
Ms Shaheed, the moderator, then gave the floor to Canadian High Commissioner Wendy Gilmour, who compared statistics of underage marriages over the decades and that the issue was mostly reported in aboriginal communities or small religious groups. She cited societal and cultural factors behind the phenomenon as well as parental expectations, poverty and lack of opportunities. Underage marriages, she said, resulted in young girls having less control over their bodies, family planning decisions, most dropped out of schools and were impacted by adverse effects of pregnancies.She also mentioned how the Canadian government was working with Pakistan to eliminate these issues, at the heart of which was poverty and lack of opportunities.
Peter Jacob of the Centre for Social Justice lamented that rejection of the forced conversion bill underlined the short-lived recognition of the problem. “I don’t recall the last time when parliament discussed religious freedom, but it has passed several resolutions and legislation to restrict the same. Rejection of the bill has emboldened perpetrators of forced conversions.”
He then posed a question whether the committees and institutions, especially the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII), behind the rejection had the competence and jurisdiction legally and constitutionally regarding forced conversions of underage minorities.
Defending the rejection of the bill, CII Chairman Dr Qibla Ayaz referred to the constitution that said no law repugnant to the holy Quran and Sunnah could be enacted. “There are problems in the process of conversion by choice that a joint committee of the religious affairs ministry and CII objected to.”
Suggesting the term be changed to ‘regulation of religious conversion’, he said forced conversion would mean it is accepted that Pakistan has a problem, which it didn’t “barring a case or two from parts of Sindh and south Punjab, but largely there was no problem in the country”.He suggested dealing with the issue together with the religious affairs ministry, CII, NGOs and the human rights ministry by chalking out a bill that will be “implementable and non-controversial”.
Joining online, Dr Ewelina Olchab, co-founder of the Coalition for Genocide Response, said child and forced marriages were omnipresent despite international standards and recognition of the issue as modern day slavery. She said she was working with Pakistan’s all-party parliamentary group on minorities and had found that legal recourse in cases of forced conversions and marriages was either not available or was ineffective.
Minority rights activist Ayra Indreyas stressed the minority communities were subjected to multiple marginality issues that stemmed from social divisions of class, caste, gender, religion. She cited her own research on the issue that there was “tension between women’s choices and patriarchal community claims, so there is a very thin line to substantiate the conversion as it’s a one-way practice”. The converted girls, she stressed, had to live with a shadow of their previous lower caste, as their religious identities were inscribed in their lives.
Economist and historian from the UK, Dr Nasreen Rehman, talked about the UK’s marriage laws and how they defined a valid marriage: there must be proof of capacity, one must be able to understand mentally what it means to be married, and if the two parties have attained legal age of consent. “Both parties to a marriage must give free, full, informed consent, and there must be proof of it.” Addressing Dr Ayaz, she said forced marriage is a hidden crime because how does one even know that full and free consent had been given.
Dr Rehman added that the LGBTQ community was also forced into marriages by having religious people guide them into it.
Additional Advocate General of Sindh High Court Kalpana Devi rued that the day the forced conversion bill was rejected she felt orphaned. She asked Dr Ayaz why conversion only happened for teen girls and that too for the purpose of marriages. “In Sindh, only 2-3pc of my community is left as the rest have been forced to flee Pakistan after facing forced conversions. We are repeatedly asked for proof of patriotism.”

Renowned painter Dr Ajaz Anwar inaugurated the gallery.
Sadequain’s nephew Sultan Ahmad donated the prints of paintings for permanent collection of the gallery.
Addressing the occasion, Dr Anwar said the abundance of Sadequain’s paintings in the art galleries and media showed that the master artist ‘continues to paint posthumously’. He was a versatile painter, poet and calligrapher who he would continue to inspire the coming generations of artists, Ajaz Anwar added.
Mr Ahmad said Sadequain belonged to a group of artists who believed in the art for life and his art reflected the problems of the common man. He said the legendary painter believed in a continuous struggle and his paintings showed complexity of stagnation and struggle in human behaviour.
GCU Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Asghar Zaidi said Sadequain’s paintings would give a message of hope, struggle and mysticism. He said the Department of History of Art at the Institute of History would organise an international conference on Sadequain’s artworks soon.

12,Leaders from ‘the periphery’ denounce suppression,"PTM chief Manzoor Pashteen laments that despite having rich resources in their area, his people had to find jobs elsewhere.","LAHORE: Politicians representing small provinces were unanimous in deploring what they called undermining of the constitution by the powers that be, holding them responsible for almost all the ills they were faced with.
They were speaking at a session moderated by senior lawyer Salman Akram Raja at the Asma Jehangir Conference 2021.
Mr Raja opened the session by asking the panelists -- National Party president and former chief minister of Balochistan Dr Abdul Malik, PPP senator Taj Haider, former senator Afrasiab Khattak, Awami National Party’s Zahid Khan, rights and climate change activist from Gilgit Baltistan Baba Jan and president of Qaumi Awami Tehreek Ayaz Latif Palejo -- what ails there areas.
Replying to the question, Baba Jan lamented that the GB people had been voiceless for the last 70 years as they were deprived of the right to vote for the National Assembly. He said his area was being run from Islamabad, while its resources, especially minerals were being plundered by grabbing lands of locals.
He regretted there was no project for the GB in the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). he urged the people of Punjab to stand for the rights of people of periphery who had been marginalised since long. He was of the view that only a socialists revolution could save the country.
Mr Palejo began with asking a rhetorical question on the behalf of Sindhi people: “Do we exist at all, or not.” He continued that the Sindhis were peaceful people who could neither pick arms against the state, nor block the roads by staging sit-ins, nor climb mountains with weapons.
He was of the view that because of this peace loving nature they were being exploited. He regretted that despite their commendable role for upholding the constitution, the judges from Sindh like Rana Bhagwan Das and Justice Sajjad Ali were not mentioned in the conference that tells a lot how the province was being discriminated against. He said a corrupt ruling class had been imposed on Sindh because it suited the powers that be as their ‘B Team’.
He said Sindh’s villages had been destroyed by commercial housing projects. Mr Palejo deplored Sindh was sidelined in the fight between the PTI and Nawaz Sharif.
Manzoor Pashteen of the Pushtun Tuhaffaz Movement (PTM), who received a big round of applause when invited to podium, said people of North Waziristan and Balochistan were being subjected to enforced disappearances and killed in fake encounters, and through systematic torture.
He regretted that a bill had been passed by the parliament for Indian spy Kalbhoshan Yadev, but the government is not ready to give justice to Ali Wazir. He lamented that despite having rich resources in their native area, his people had to find employment in big cities or Dubai.
MNA Mohsin Dawar from North Waziristan Agency blamed the federal constitutional structure for deprivations of small provinces. He said size of a province or its population did not matter, when it came to exploitation. He cited example of former East Pakistan, saying despite having 56pc population, Benaglis were deprived of their rights and finally had to quit.
He said Tehreek-i-Labbaik was being treated softly because establishment did not want to annoy Punjab, adding that was why TLP chief Saad Rizvi had been released from jail while Ali Wazir was still languishing.
Senator Taj Haider said all areas had participated in the struggle for Pakistan, but if certain nationalities felt they were being undermined it should be alarming for the state.

14,"‘Inequality in wealth, income in Pakistan is deliberate and rising’","LAHORE: Senior economist Hafeez Pasha, moderator of the session on ‘Inequality in wealth and income Pakistan’ at...","LAHORE: Senior economist Hafeez Pasha, moderator of the session on ‘Inequality in wealth and income Pakistan’ at the Asma Jahangir Conference, 2021, opened the talk citing Article 38 of the Constitution. And it was an apt tribute to rights activist Asma Jahangir as well.
The article is about the well-being of the people and about ensuring equitable adjustment of rights between employers and employees, and landlords and tenants.
In the ensuing discussion, Dr Kardar came up with glaring data on the wealth divide and the rising gap, often attracting ‘ohs’ and ‘aahs’ from the crowd, most of which consisted of lawyers, students and NGO people.
“This was the vision of the lawmakers back in the 1970s, which sadly has now been forgotten,” he said, citing data the richest one percent of the population holds over nine percent of the income share, while the poorest one percent of the population holds only 0.15 percent of national income.
According to the agriculture census of 2010, one percent of farmers (read: feudal lords) own 22 percent of the agricultural land. The same formidable one percent occupies 16 percent of residential property, while two million families with eight or more people live in a one-room house.
Panelist Dr Kaiser Bengali appeared more of a social activist than a technocrat while describing wealth and income inequalities. He called the top elites of Pakistan on the wrong side of the fence, said the class was mainly responsible for creating two Pakistan.
One side looks like California, and the other a ‘Pakistan, he said, adding that “the divide is deliberate, and mainly made by the top elite,” he said.
He blamed the authoritarian regimes in Pakistan for poor income and growth indicators and left the audience in disbelief that the golden eras of Pakistan in terms of economic growth and development were the 1970s (of the Bhutto) and later on the 1990s (of Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif).
At the end of the day, he said, it was the class divide, and not the civilian-military divide, that instigated the economic divide.
“And the cure lies, not in constitutional reforms, but in baghawat (revolt),” he said, invoking a standing ovation.
Dr Shahid Kardar said that, in fact, no country or monetary institution wanted to help run a country of 125 million people. The IMF reforms would only burden the poor with Rs400bn indirect taxation.
MACRO INDICATORS: The session titled ‘Macroeconomic indicators’, moderated by Khurram Hussain and Dr Kaiser Bengali, Dr Aisah Ghous Pasha, Ali Hasnain and Nadeemul Haq sat to resolve the complex economic language, dominated by heavy jargons.
Khurram wanted to know if there were two functional economies working in the country, one run by the government and the other by the public.
Dr Bengali said growth rate figures were often misleading. He said the real indicators were jobs, exports, and people’s purchasing power.
Dr Pasha said narratives on economic security and national security were interlinked. Unfortunately, she said, we have politicized the economy only for political scoring.
Mr Hasanain said macro indicators don’t reflect the real society. He said there was always talk on expenditures on health, and education, so on but the efficiency of the expenditures was hardly examined. He talked about regulating property rights and ensuring the rule of law.
Mr Haque said data and numbers were only for the consumption of donors to grab headlines, whereas the real issue was to create opportunities, instead of talking about the welfare economy.
The session ended on a sour note after the panelists differed on the core direction of the economy.
