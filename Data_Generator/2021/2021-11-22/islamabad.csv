This will also ensure economic stability in Pakistan, the speakers added.
The webinar titled ‘Accelerating Pakistan’s Economic Growth through Skilled Labour Force’ was arranged by the TVET Sector Support Programme (SSP) with the aim to highlight the significance of skill development for the youth to become globally competitive as well as ensure sustained economic and social development.
The TVET SSP was funded by the European Union, Germany and Norwegian embassy while its implementing partner was the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) in close collaboration with the National Vocational and Technical Training Commission (NAVTTC), provincial Technical Education and Vocational Training Authorities (TEVTAs) and many other private sector organisations.
Labour market, TVET and gender expert Sabina Ahmed, labour economist and labour market expert Dr Zafar Mueen Nasir and Head of TVET SSP Iris Cordelia Rotzoll were the key participants in the webinar panel.
Moderator Sonia Omair, technical adviser communication TVET SSO, explained the importance of TVET sector and technical and vocational trainings to achieve strong careers in the national and global labour market.
In her opinion, Sabina Ahmed said education merely was not the way to progress and had the sustainable position in the job industry.
“Trainings both technical and vocational for our people especially youth are direly needed to attain best career opportunities at the national and international level,” she maintained.
Dr Zafar Mueen Nasir spoke in detail about how to gain sustainable growth in social and economic sector. He mentioned that sustainability in economic and social growth was related to the employment opportunities.
He, however, linked job opportunities to skill enhancement.
“The more people are technically trained, higher the chances to be recruited in reputable organisations,” he stressed.
Participating in the discussion, Iris Cordelia Rotzoll expressed satisfaction that people were now realising the importance of technical and vocational education and training for the workforce employability.
“People are enhancing their skills through TVET SSP and thus workforce employability is also increasing. Through green and digital skills, we can do more for the economy of Pakistan,” he said.
The speakers also focused on disparity between labour market demand of trained individuals and education given to the population in the contemporary era which was not according to the needs of the industry.
According to them, workforce employability depended on various factors such as education, managerial skills, adaptation of technology, level of investment, but technical and vocational competence remained on the top.
They also stressed that the workforce must have a high-quality education along with demand-driven skills training.

In addition, newly-appointed Chief Traffic Officer (CTO) Taimoor Khan directed the officials to register FIRs against those using bogus and fake registration plates instead of issuing them tickets.
A spokesman for the traffic police said on Sunday the CTO issued directives to all circle in-charges to take action against those who do not have number plates or non-standard number plates.
Motorcycles and vehicles with fake and bogus registration plates will be booked instead of being fi9ned, he added.
The CTO ordered DSPs and in-charges of circles to direct the traffic staff deployed at all entrances and exit points to take strict action against vehicles without any number plates and non-model number plates.
The CTO warned that the circle in-charges will be held responsible if any negligence was found on part of their subordinates.
He said besides making best arrangements for the smooth flow of traffic in the city, crime prevention, effective enforcement of traffic laws, prevention of road accidents and road users on highways would be the top priority.
“Protecting the life and property is one of my top priorities and no excuses will be accepted from citizens for tampering with the number plate and using fake registration plates,” he said, adding that the citizens were advised to use computerised number plates to avoid legal action.
It may be noted that after four months, the city finally got a full-time chief traffic officer (CTO) who took charge of his office on Friday.

— Dawn

 
TAXILA: As many as 12 couples tied the knot as per their religious rituals at a mass marriage ceremony organised by Minhaj Welfare Foundation (MWF) at a marriage hall near Wah on Sunday.
Besides office-bearers of the foundation, administration officials, workers from political and welfare associations, relatives of the couples and members of civil society participated in the ceremony.
According to the organisers, so far over 100 couples have gotten married at ceremonies organised by the foundation and this was the ninth event.
Speakers said there are many parents in our society who are unable to arrange marriages of their adult sons and daughters due to financial and other constraints. They said the trust was helping such parents get their sons and daughters married, appealing to people to arrange mass wedding ceremonies for those who could not afford the expenses of their children’s marriages.
MWF (Rawalpindi district) General Secretary Saifur Rehman said the marriage ceremony was being organised in Taxila for nine consecutive years. He said with the financial assistance of philanthropists, so far marriage ceremonies of around 100 couples belonging to Taxila and Wah had been arranged. He said 50 guests of each couple including their relatives and friends were served lunch.
Chief guest at the event, Dr Hussain Mohiuddin, vice chancellor of Minhaj University, said under the prevailing conditions, it was difficult for parents to marry off their daughters.
In these dire circumstances, the foundation has started a grand project of collective marriages. Most people facing financial challenges, he said, are unable to marry their daughters because of the demand of a heavy dowry. He said the concept of holding mass wedding ceremonies was to support the poor segment of society financially and ensure timely marriages of their daughters in a respectable way.
“The holding of mass wedding ceremonies in the era of materialism is not less than a miracle for the poor,” Mr Hussain said, adding conducting these ceremonies is a good omen as it provides solace to the destitute.
He said that the foundation has been holding mass marriage ceremonies at the central, provincial and divisional level every year to help poor parents discharge their responsibility of marrying off their daughters.
He said so far 2,700 couples across the country had solemnised their marriages through arrangements made by the MWF.
The newly-wed couples thanked the foundation for their help and said such weddings should be organised in other areas as well to help poor people.

According to a statement issued by the authority on Sunday, Islamabad Art and History Display Museum is in the final stages of restoration and once completed, detailed images about the capital city’s history will be showcased.
It said images and artefacts of historical significance shall also be displayed.
“CDA management is considering to involve artists from the city to form a non official board to manage this centre. The object being to promote art and culture and also to promote a link of residents with history of Islamabad,” the statement added. Speaking to Dawn Director General (Environment) Irfan Niazi said within a few weeks, ongoing renovation work will be completed.

Detailed images about capital’s history to be showcased inside

He said CDA has historical pictures detailing moments including the time when the federal cabinet headed by President Ayub Khan passed Islamabad’s master plan and pictures of the under-construction Parliament House, presidency and so on.
F-9 Citizen Club
The CDA board, last month, had decided to utilise the Citizen Club building and set up the Ghandhara Heritage, Culture and Convention Centre.
CDA officials said currently, the Covid-19 vaccination centre is operating in a portion of the said building and until it is not shifted, CDA cannot set up the culture and convention centre there.
However, the officials said soon the centre will be shifted to offices of the Environment Wing (also located in F-9 park). The wing will be shifted to Shakarparian Art and Craft Village. “Currently, offices are being renovated at Art and Craft Village where offices of environment wing will be shifted. After completion of renovation work, we will shift environment office to Art and Craft Village, before shifting Covid-19 vaccination centre to environment offices in F-9, then we will start working to setup Culture and Convention Centre,” a CDA official told Dawn.
It is relevant to note here that Prime Minister Imran Khan had asked the CDA Chairman Amer Ali Ahmed and architect Nayyar Ali Dada to propose a viable utility plan for the building, which spreads over 22 acres with a 265,000 square feet covered area.
The building has facilities such as restaurants, an indoor pool, gym, lobby, aerobics area and fitness centre.
The project was started by the CDA in 2008. When the structure was completed, the Supreme Court in 2010 took up the case and ruled that the building cannot be used as a club.
Last month, the CDA board decided to set up the Culture and Convention Centre in it, approved rules for it and decided that a board of governors will manage the centre.
It was also decided that people would have access to facilities and there will be no mandatory membership. CDA officials said that the board had decided that citizens could avail the facilities but no compulsory membership would be required for it, adding, that the club building will be used for holding conventions, exhibitions and provision of sports facilities, including a gym.

TAXILA: Sikh pilgrims from across the world visited Gurdwara Punja Sahib in Hassanabdal on Sunday to perform rituals in connection with the 552nd birth anniversary of Baba Guru Nanak Dev, founder of the Sikh religion.
Around 3,000 pilgrims came from India. Religious slogans including Wahe Guru Ji Ka Khalsa and Wahe Guru Ji Ki Fateh echoed through the gurdwara that was decorated with colourful lights as pilgrims performed rituals including Matha Taki, Ashnan and the exchange of gifts.
Speaking to journalists, pilgrims hailed the government’s initiative to open the Kartarpur Corridor to facilitate the Sikh community. They lauded Prime Minister Imran Khan for laying the foundation stone for Baba Guru Nanak University in Nankana Sahib and issuing a commemorative coin on the occasion of the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev.
Group leader of Sikh pilgrims from India Sardar Gurmeet Singh said the pilgrims had come to Pakistan with the message of love, peace, friendship and harmony.
“Pakistan is the land of Sikh Gurus and Sikhs love this land as this is our second homeland. We are always welcomed with love and it is a true example of Sikh-Muslim friendship,” he said.

12,Misuse of antibiotics jeopardises usefulness of essential drugs: experts,"Antibiotic resistant infections will kill an estimated 300 million people worldwide, Dr Khan says","ISLAMABAD: Repeated and improper uses of antibiotics are primary causes of increase in drug-resistant bacteria in humans and animals. Misuse of antibiotics jeopardises the usefulness of essential drugs. Decreasing inappropriate antibiotic use is the best way to control antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as children are of particular concern because they have the highest rates of antibiotic use.
This was pointed out by Prof Ejaz A Khan of Department of Pediatrics and Infectious Diseases, Shifa International Hospital as AMR week is being observed from Nov 18-24.
According to estimates 700,000 deaths occur as a result of various types of infections each year worldwide.
The theme of the campaign this year is ‘Spread Awareness, Stop Resistance’.

Antibiotic resistant infections will kill an estimated 300 million people worldwide, Dr Khan says

Being the focal point for AMR, the National Institute of Health (NIH), under the auspices of Ministry of National Health Services has planned a series of activities including the distribution of awareness materials for the general public, webinars, conferences, photo and poster competitions for children.
It is worth mentioning here that antimicrobials – including antibiotics, anti-virals, anti-fungals and anti-parasitics – are medicines used to prevent and treat infections in humans, animals and plants.
All around the world, bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites are changing, and no longer respond to medicines used to treat the infections they cause. This antimicrobial resistance makes infections harder to treat which increases the risk of disease spread, severe illness and death. Antimicrobial resistance emerges naturally, usually through genetic changes. However, overuse and misuse of antimicrobials in humans, livestock, and agriculture have accelerated the process, as has a lack of clean water and sanitation, and inadequate infection prevention and control.
During an event, NIH Executive Director Maj Gen Aamer Ikram said that it was a serious problem and one with the potential to develop into a global health crisis.
“The good news is that each one of us can act to slow down the rate of AMR. One of the most effective ways we can do that is by making sure we use our antibiotics appropriately. This helps ensure medicines remain effective not only in dealing with serious illnesses but also common infections,” he said.
Prof Khan said: “Antibiotic resistant infections will kill an estimated 300 million people worldwide - more than from cancer - by 2050 unless proper and urgent action is taken by all of us. The total estimated costs for management of AMR infections would spiral to $100 trillion. Antimicrobials are also used selectively in poultry, plant agriculture and commercial fish and seafood farming. Contamination of human food of animal origin (meat and milk), with drug-resistant bacteria may be transferred to consumers. With a rise of bacteria resistant to antibiotics in the last decade, many bacterial infections are becoming resistant to the most commonly prescribed antibiotic treatments.
“Covid-19 worsened our habits of bad prescriptions with both healthcare professionals and the public responsible for using indiscriminately the powerful and precious broad-spectrum antibiotics with impunity. Every time a person takes antibiotics, sensitive bacteria are killed, but resistant ones may be left to grow and multiply.
“Unnecessary antibiotics have to be curtailed urgently! In Pakistan antibiotic use is alarmingly high both in humans and animals. Approximately, 70-90pc of patients for viral upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are prescribed antibiotics unnecessarily that are mostly self-limiting. Resistant infections due to these ‘superbugs’ are causing thousands of deaths and hospitalisation each year.
“We must resolve to act urgently by taking steps that will curtail antibiotic misuse. AMR is a global health issue and Pakistan is raising awareness on the need to preserve the power of antibiotics through appropriate use during this week and beyond. It is not too late to reduce the impact of AMR and we want to highlight that all healthcare professionals and the public have a part to play in preserving the effectiveness of antibiotics. By reducing the spread of infections and changing how we produce, prescribe and use these medicines, we can reduce the impact and limit the spread of antibiotic resistance,” Prof Khan said.

15,"Privatisation Commission, CDA board to discuss Convention Centre’s sale",Civic agency recently was informed that federal cabinet has already approved privatisation of building,"ISLAMABAD: The city managers have decided to invite officials of the Privatisation Commission to its upcoming board meeting to be held this week to discuss issues related to Jinnah Convention Centre.
Recently, the CDA stated that it had no objection to the privatisation of Jinnah Convention Centre (JCC) but was waiting for study reports which were to be submitted by the Ministry of Privatisation before getting a revised allotment letter.
On the other hand, the Privatisation Commission said the transaction of JCC was put on hold after the CDA changed its stance as earlier it had issued a no-objection certificate (NOC) and later demanded study reports.
The JCC is located at one end of the Constitution Avenue and is used as a venue for exhibitions and summits by private and public sector organisations.

Civic agency recently was informed that federal cabinet has already approved privatisation of building

Through a letter, CDA Member Estate Naveed Illahi a few weeks ago told the Ministry of Interior that the civic agency had never opposed the privatisation of JCC rather it had asked the Ministry of Privatisation to provide study reports regarding availability of water, electricity from a grid, a solid waste management plan, traffic impact study and report on sewage treatment plant (STP).
“In case, no study was conducted in this regard, the matter may kindly be brought into the notice of the prime minister or the federal cabinet as deemed suitable for appropriate intervention in the matter,” read the letter.
Sources said a few days ago the Privatisation Commission through a letter informed the CDA that the federal cabinet had already approved the privatisation of the JCC; therefore, the CDA board should not raise objections.
To this, the sources said, the CDA decided to invite to the Privatisation Commission and Ministry of Privatisation to attend the upcoming board meeting to share their point of views.
“Yes, we have decided to write to officials of Privatisation Commission and the ministry to attend our board meeting when it will discuss issues related to JCC,” said a board member of the CDA.
The CDA board in July had decided that reports on the availability of water, solid waste management plan, electricity and power supply from a grid, traffic impact and sewage treatment plant (STP) were required by the Ministry of Privatisation before the latter gets a revised allotment letter of the JCC.
It said it had been suggested that the 3.4 acres originally allocated for parking may be reconsidered as an amenity area in order to avoid any legal complications.
The CDA’s letter said: “It is submitted that CDA has not stopped the revision of allotment letter as the decision of federal cabinet is final for the CDA as well as Privatisation Commission,” the letter said.
An official of the CDA said the civic agency had no objection to privatisation of JCC but it will have to see impact on roads and load on other services after privatisation of the JCC.
Last month, the Senate Standing Committee on Privatisation was informed that the transaction of JCC had been put on hold after the CDA “changed its stance regarding the facility.”
The committee was told that the CDA objected to JCC’s sale on the plea that it could not be converted from an amenity to commercial as per the regulations. The objection from the CDA came at a time when the Privatisation Commission (PC) was close to completing the JCC’s transaction.
The Senate body asked the standing committee on interior to deliberate on the issue since the CDA comes under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Interior.

16,Past govts’ negligence led to encroachment of forest land: PM’s aide,"Says land worth Rs500bn converted into residential, commercial areas, pledges to reclaim 700,000 acres","ISLAMABAD: Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam on Sunday said negligence of previous governments and lack of ownership on their part over the last several years led to massive encroachments on the country’s resource-rich forest lands across the country.
Speaking at a media briefing, Mr Aslam said the previous regimes kept a criminal silence on these encroachments and avoided any punitive action against the land grabbing mafias.
“But now no stone will be left un-turned to recover the encroached forest land that has the potential to increase existing forest cover from 5pc to 8pc,” he said.
Malik Amin said the encroached lands, currently valued at Rs500 billion, had been converted into, among others, residential societies and commercial areas, causing irreversible environmental degradation, loss of biodiversity and public health woes.

Says land worth Rs500bn converted into residential, commercial areas, pledges to reclaim 700,000 acres

He said under the cadastral mapping some 50,000 square kilometres of land was covered in the four federating units of Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Balochistan and Sindh.
Spelling out details, he said in Punjab and KP around 160,000 acres of public or state land was encroached upon, adding that the most recent findings of the Survey of Pakistan had concluded that around 700,000 acres (2,833 sq km) of the forest land was currently under illegal occupation.
He further estimated that the encroached state land was highest in Sindh.
Sharing the digitised cadastral maps of state lands and encroachments, he announced that Prime Minister Imran Khan would share this data with the provinces for stringent action against land grabbers.
He told media that the maps belonging to Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan had been prepared by the Survey of Pakistan, whereas preparation of maps of encroached forest lands in Sindh had hit snags because of information delay from the provincial authorities.
According to one of the completed digital mapping, 10, 970 acres (71pc)of forest land in Benazirabad district, Sindh, was encroached out of the total 15, 450 acres whereas Takhtpari Forest in Rawalpindi had a total of 2,210 acres area out of which 755 acres, almost 34pc, was encroached, the PM’s aide said.
He said the Lohibher Forest area located at the fringes of Rawalpindi and Islamabad had over 57pc (629 acres) of its total 1,089 acres area devoured by land mafia.
Karachi Forest Division, which had already turned into a concrete jungle, originally had 2,703 square kilometres of forest area, which had now shrunk to only 0.4pc at the hands of the land grabbers.
He recalled that cadastral mapping was launched by the prime minister one-and-a-half years ago to launch punitive and impartial action against land encroachers.
