0,Ombudsman’s damning report on Sindh healthcare system belies govt claims,The report reveals no free medicines are available at any government hospital.,"KARACHI: The Sindh government’s tall claim about improved healthcare system and medical facilities have come under a serious question as the provincial ombudsman in the annual report has cited “deficient infrastructure and manpower” and exposed the much-trumpeted stance of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) about offering free treatment to people by stating that even in emergency cases, patients are not provided free medicines. 
The facts were shared in the ‘Annual Report 2020’ of Provincial Ombudsman, Sindh, which highlighted the performance, achievements and progress during the previous year. 
The report submitted to Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah by Sindh Ombudsman Ajaz Ali Khan carried details of performance of provincial departments. It shared that in 2020 a total of 6,048 complaints were received, out of which 1,229 were taken up.
While pointing out weaknesses of different institutions and making recommendations for addressing the problems, the report highlighted the state of affairs of the Sindh health department where it found many flaws and stressed the need for immediate resolution. 
No new hospital in Karachi
For instance, the city of Karachi of over 20 million people, the report says, has not seen any new public-sector hospital becoming operational in so many years while the quality of services at the existing and available healthcare facilities doesn’t meet the required standards. 
It regrets that the people visit government hospitals only ‘under compelling circumstances’. 

No free medicines are available at govt hospitals 

“The number of public-sector hospitals is very low as compared to the requirements,” it says. “For example in the seventh largest city of the world, Karachi, no public-sector hospital has been made operational after Major Ziauddin Abbasi Shaheed Hospital in Nazimabad, Karachi. Quality of services available in public sector hospitals is not equal to the standard of private sector hospitals with the result that the general public has no confidence in government hospitals. Layman visits government hospitals only under compelling circumstances. Poor quality of services is also because of no accountability system in these hospitals; for example no record is available to the general public of the nature of patients and mortality rates.” 
People pay out of own pockets 
Despite being publicised as free service providers, the report mentions “out of pocket expenses” borne by poor families in public sector hospitals of Sindh. 
The fact exposed the PPP government’s claim it makes every now and again of leading a ‘best free healthcare service in Pakistan’ for the people of the province and all over the country. 
“This is a general complaint that medicines are purchased from private medical stores. Even in emergency cases, attendants run from pillar to post to arrange medicines and blood, etc,” says the Sindh Ombudsman’s report. 
The fact regarding unavailability of free medicines at the Sindh government hospitals came as a grim reminder of raids conducted by the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) in June this year in different commercial markets of Karachi, which led to the recovery of a huge quantity of medicines stolen from the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases and the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi. 
Referring to ‘deficient infrastructure,’ the Sindh Ombudsman mentions the failure of public-sector hospitals, clinics and dispensaries in Sindh in maintaining the standards of service putting strain on the overall health system. 
“Infrastructure of public sector hospitals in big cities and dispensaries and clinics in far-flung areas are not up to the standard,” it says. “Sindh is experiencing a high rate of population growth. The increasing rate of urbanization and resulting disparities further reduces the access to quality health services for the urban poor. This will also put further strain on the health system in terms of infrastructure resource needs and administrative requirements.” 
Shortage of medical staff 
The report also reveals that the number of doctors and paramedical staff does not match the number of population throughout the province counting lack of proper incentives, insecurity of employment, transfer and posting not based on ground realities and lack of facilities in rural areas as key reasons for scarcity of trained medical personnel. 
“As a result of the deficiencies the doctors and paramedical staff appointed on rural quota are interested to serve in urban areas. In the recent past, a large number of doctors have flown out of the country due to law and order situation and unattractive job facilities,” it says. 
Need to check private hospitals 
Recommending ‘immediate attention’ from both federal and provincial governments, the ombudsman also emphasises the need for effective role of the Sindh Healthcare Commission (SHHC) to check quackery and operations of private hospitals. 
“A large number of quacks are running their business even in big cities and they are responsible for spreading diseases and also make the lives of the public miserable,” it says. “The 18th Amendment to the Constitution resulted in the devolution of the Sector Services including health to the provinces. The SHCC was tasked with strengthening the government’s regulatory function through licensing and quality assurance and banning quackery in all its forms. But no mentionable results have been achieved so far.” 
It says Sindh has a thriving private sector with the highest concentration and levels of utilisation of private sector health facilities in Pakistan. However, the ombudsman reveals that the private healthcare service providers are largely unregulated, whilst holding over 80 per cent of the province’s health service infrastructure.

1,"Prices of bread, bakery items set to go up","The new rates of medium, small and mini milky bread will be Rs111, Rs76 and Rs51 versus Rs101, Rs66 and Rs46.","KARACHI: Man­ufac­turers in Karachi have decided to give a second price-hike shock of the year to already inflation-hit consumers by increasing prices of bread and other bakery items by 10-12 per cent effective from Nov 26. 
As per new price list, the large, medium, small and mini plain bread will be sold at Rs135, Rs110, Rs75 and Rs50 as compared to Rs120, Rs100, Rs65 and Rs45 rates. 
The new rates of medium, small and mini milky bread will be Rs111, Rs76 and Rs51 versus Rs101, Rs66 and Rs46. 
Consumers will have to pay Rs110 for bran bread as compared to Rs100, while price of cut burger bun (4 pieces) has been raised to Rs70 from Rs60. 
The new prices of special burger bun and pillow pack have been fixed at Rs75 and Rs100 as compared to Rs65 and Rs90. 
Manufacturers have kept the prices of fruit bun (large), school bun and burger roll unchanged at Rs35, Rs10 and Rs25. 
Consumers faced a price jump of 8.5pc to 9pc in April. 
In 2019, bread prices went up by over eight per cent ahead of Ramazan followed by another price hike of 9pc ahead of Eidul Azha in the same year. 
In July 2020, manufacturers had raised the prices by over 11pc. 
The general secretary of the Karachi Bread Association (KBA), Haroon Iqbal Sheikh, confirmed to Dawn on Sunday that the decision to enhance bread prices was taken “in view of rising rates of various materials used in bread making”. 
He said super fine flour price had risen to Rs3,750 from Rs3,275 per 50kg bag in April, 2021. 
He said wrapping products (poly bags) price had now gone up to Rs720-750 per kg as compared to Rs675 per kg. 
Ghee cost Rs322 per kg now as compared to Rs250 in April 2021, while cooking oil was selling at Rs425 as against previous rate of Rs233 per litre. 
Sugar price had hit Rs150 per kg recently and but reverted to Rs96 per kg. 
Mr Haroon said the losing value of the rupee against the dollar had raised the cost of imported raw material and products like preservatives, improving agents and emulsifiers.

While inaugurating a diabetes screening camp in Nazimabad, JI-Karachi chief Hafiz Naeem ur Rahman accused the Pakistan Peoples Party government in Sindh of ruining the health system across the province, mainly in Karachi, where it was mainly relying on non-governmental organisations.
He criticised the PPP government for “deliberately damaging” health facilities being run by the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC).
“Instead of bringing reforms in provincial institutions, the Sindh government now encroaching upon powers and authority of the local government,” he said.
“The Sindh government neglected and deprived the local government hospitals when they were operating under the municipal system. Now it is taking them over in the name of reforms. The move to take control of the KIHD is unjust and condemnable.”
He said that the KIHD was a KMC-run cardiac health facility, where all modern cardiac treatment facilities were supposed to be available free of charge for the people of Karachi.

4,"Centre-Sindh row over transfer of PSP, PAS officers persists","Establishment division says provincial govt was consulted ‘thrice’ about the transfer of officers, ""but got no response"".","KARACHI: The row between the federal and Sindh governments over transfer of eight DIGs and four secretaries still persists as the establishment division (ED) has rejected the claim recently made by Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah-led set-up about consultation saying it was held more than once.
The establishment division also rejected the contention of the Sindh government that officers of the Pakistan Administrative Service (PAS) and Police Services of Pakistan (PSP) serving in other provinces for more than 10 years had not been transferred. 
On Nov 9, the services of DIG Maqsood Ahmed, DIG Javed Akbar Riaz, DIG Naeem Ahmed Sheikh, DIG Saqib Ismail Memon, DIG Noman Siddiqi, DIG Younis Chandio (currently working in the Federal Investigation Agency), DIG Abdullah Sheikh and DIG Omar Shahid Hamid along with Planning and Development Board chairman Hasan Naqvi and three other secretaries were transferred to other provinces.

Establishment division says provincial govt was consulted ‘thrice’

The Sindh cabinet had rejected the transfer orders and the CM was of the view that the federal government was bound to have a meaningful discussion with him before transferring from or posting in province any officer.
Terming the provincial government’s attitude ‘unfortunate’, the establishment division while citing a recent order of the Sindh High Court had asked the Sindh government for “immediately relieving” the transferred officers so that they can join their new posts in other provinces.
However, a source in the Sindh government said that CM Shah had not taken any decision yet and he was expected to hold a formal consultation with Chief Secretary Mumtaz Ali Shah and Inspector General of Police Mushtaq Ahmed Mahar this week.
Responding to two letters dated Nov 15 and 16 of the Sindh government, the establishment division sent a letter to the provincial authorities stating: “Consultation regarding PAS/PSP officers of BS-20 due for rotation was done thrice inter-alia with chief secretary and secretary, general administration, Sindh”.
It said that the complete lists of officers having served for more than 10 years in Sindh, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was shared with provincial services secretaries “with the request to nominate officers to be rotated in the first phase”.
It said Punjab and KP responded to their request, but “as per practice, the Sindh government did not respond to it”. Besides, lists of officers due for rotation in the second and third phases were shared with the Sindh government and others and the officers’ names were also shared.
“In the interest of transparency, lists of officers due for rotation for the said phases were also placed on the website of the establishment division on March 2, 2021 for information of all concerned. However, none of the governments ever objected to the proposed rotation of PAS/PSP officers of BS-20 in the second and third phases,” stated the letter.
“Consultation as prescribed under rules was carried out, therefore, the non-responsiveness on the part of the Sindh government may not be a valid ground to make out a case at this stage,” the establishment division asserted.
Citing a recent SHC order, the letter said the transfer and posting were part of conditions of service and the establishment division was the competent authority to determine where a civil servant was to be posted. Its powers of transfer and posting of the officers could not be termed as “without jurisdiction or lawful authority”, it added.
The SHC in its order stated that Section 10 of the Civil Servants Act 1973 and Rule 10 of the Police Service of Pakistan, 1985 provided transfer and posting of the civil servants/PSP officers to different provinces and the competent authority can “withdraw any such officer of federal government before the expiry of their tenure limitation”. 
The SHC further stated that “rotation policy cannot restrict the process of the competent authority [i.e. the establishment division] from withdrawing any civil servant/PSP officer from the provincial governments at any time on administrative grounds/valid reasons”.
The establishment division asked the Sindh government to immediately relieve the transferred officers so as to enable them to join their new places of posting.

5,"Doctors say all children should get anti-measles, rubella vaccines","KARACHI: Extending their full support to the ongoing national anti-measles, rubella vaccination campaign,...","KARACHI: Extending their full support to the ongoing national anti-measles, rubella vaccination campaign, representatives of the Pakistan Paediatric Association (PPA) has urged parents to have their children vaccinated against the two contagious viral diseases during the current drive, even if they had received the vaccine shots earlier.  
“It’s extremely important that all children aged nine months up to 15 years should receive the anti-measles, rubella vaccine, including those who have had measles or who have earlier received the shots for measles and rubella, get vaccinated against the two diseases during the ongoing drive. This will help eliminate the disease from the community,” said Prof Jalal Akbar, president of PPA-Sindh chapter, at a press conference held on Saturday at the Karachi press club.  
This would also help improve children’s immunity against the illnesses, he added. 
Sharing an update on the drive, he said so far 30 million children across the country had been vaccinated with no major side effects. “Measles is a highly contagious viral disease. It remains an important cause of death among young children globally, despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine.” 
Talking about the mortalities caused by measles worldwide, Dr Khalid Shafi, also representing the association, said more than 140,000 deaths occurred in 2018 from measles in children under five years of age. 
“During 2000-2018, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 23.2 million children’s deaths. Global measles’ deaths have decreased by 73 per cent from an estimated 536,000 in 2000 to 142,000 in 2018 whereas 346 million people received measles vaccination through 45 supplementary immunisation activities in 37 countries,” he said.  
According to experts, 82 countries have verified as having eliminated measles and 81 having eliminated rubella.  
“The Measles Rubella initiative launched in 2001 is a global programme and committed to ensuring that no child dies from measles or is born with congenital rubella syndrome,” said Dr Waseem Jamalvi, PPA-general secretary, Sindh chapter.  
Explaining the vaccination strategy, he said it had three components. “Keeping routine immunisation coverage high, periodically initiating catch-up vaccination for all children from nine months to 15 years of age regardless of their vaccination history or history of disease, and starting vaccination campaigns after every four years.” 
He also highlighted the PPA’s efforts with respect to the anti-measles, rubella campaign and said the association carried out doctors’ training as well advocacy activities.

6,Pre-arrest bail granted to PTI lawmaker in torture case,Police had booked MPA Malik Shahzad Awan along with his aides for allegedly torturing a man and committing theft in Madina Colony.,"KARACHI: A district and sessions judge has granted interim pre-arrest bail to a Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf MPA in a case pertaining to hurling death threats and attacking a man and his family.
Police booked PTI MPA Malik Shahzad Awan along with his aides Imran Shah, Qaiser and three unknown men for allegedly torturing a man, forcibly entering his house and committing theft in Madina Colony.
The lawmaker had appeared before District and Sessions Judge (west) Abdul Naeem Memon after remaining absconder for months and moved an application for grant of bail to avoid arrest.
He submitted that he wanted to surrender to join the trial proceedings but apprehended his arrest by the police since the court had already issued a warrant for his arrest and also ordered the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) to block his computerised national identity card.

Without touching the merits of the case, the judge granted him interim pre-arrest bail subject to furnishing of a surety of Rs100,000. He was also directed to surrender before the trial court.
On Friday, a judicial magistrate had directed the police to arrest the lawmaker and produce him in court directing Nadra authorities to block his CNIC.
The investigating officer of the case had quoted complainant Muhammad Aslam Awan as saying that he was present at his house in Mianwali Para in Baldia Town on the night of July 2, 2019 when MPA Awan, Shah, Qaiser and three unknown men entered.
The lawmaker hit the complainant`s son with a rifle butt. MPA Awan told him to withdraw the application he had lodged with the Mauripur police station against him.

A two-judge bench headed by Justice K. K. Agha allowed the appeals and acquitted the appellants by extending them the benefit of doubt.
An antiterrorism court had sentenced Mohammad Shoaib alias Shahoo and Fahad Bin Shakeel alias Bandoo to life in prison in April this year for killing Constable Aftab Shah in Malir in 2011.
The convicts through their lawyers challenged the trial court order and after hearing both sides and examining the record and proceedings the appellate bench allowed the appeals.
The bench in its order observed that the prosecution could not establish its case beyond a shadow of a doubt as the evidence of an eyewitness seemed to be not trustworthy. 
It further said that the eyewitness could only pick out one appellant during an identification parade conducted by a judicial magistrate in 2017 and deposed that he was present at the crime place when the incident had taken placed, but failed to assign any role in the commissioning of the offence and thus the bench could not safely rely on it.

9,"This week 50 years ago: Eid, fake Gandhara art and blood bank","ON Nov 20, 1971 the nation celebrated Eidul Fitr with traditional fervour. In Karachi, things were not drastically...","ON Nov 20, 1971 the nation celebrated Eidul Fitr with traditional fervour. In Karachi, things were not drastically different from as they are today. Clifton’s seaside was the place, as it still is, for a great many people to spend time at with their loved ones on the festive, colourful occasion. So, in 1971, there was a huge crowd at Clifton of children and elders who had gathered to celebrate Eid at a mela (carnival) which was to last for three days. For them, the mela was the real treat — away from the humdrum of the busy city life — where they moved freely from one corner to the other in the lush green lawn in front of the famous aquarium. They had reached the spot by camel and donkey carts because that year the traffic police did not allow motor vehicles to park near the beach. 
By the way, immediately after the three off days, the public had to bear a problem which to date bothers them. On Nov 24, prices of essential food items registered a sharp increase. Some of them even became scarce, and there was a possibility of large-scale hoarding. On Nov 24, one seer of sugar was sold for Rs2.50 while it was available at Rs1.87 the day earlier. The price of atta went up from 65 paisa per seer to 75 paisa. Similarly, 50 paisa more was charged for one seer of daal — it was previously sold for Rs1.50. The rate of 20 dozen eggs was quoted as Rs 97, Rs 12 more than what they were available in the market for on Nov 23. 
That was not the only newsworthy issue that caught the media’s attention. On Nov 28, it was reported that eight fake pieces of Gandhara sculptures meant to reach the United States were seized by the Karachi Excise Police and the Department of Archaeology. All the sculptures of Buddha, in postures where he could be seen seated or standing, were caught from a hotel which was raided on the information that charas was being smuggled out of Pakistan. When room No: 5 of the hotel was searched, the police found to their astonishment four wooden cases containing the phony pieces which were presumably sold to an American as originals representing Gandhara art. After the raid, the law enforcers got in touch with the Department of Archaeology, and its director Nazimuddin Ahmed examined the sculptures. They were simple casts made in a crude form with a mixture of white cement and plaster of Paris. 
But it was also a troubled period because of the rising border tensions with reference to the situation in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) as a result of which national emergency had been announced. Given the resilience and patriotism of the Pakistani nation, especially Karachiites, the country has always been able to face such challenges with bravery and determination. By Nov 28, hundreds of blood donors had registered themselves with the blood bank at the Jinnah Post-Graduate Medical Centre (JPMC) after the call of national emergency. They also volunteered their services to assist the bank in intensifying its efforts to collect more blood, if there was a need for it.

The guards had kept Bheel detained at their torture cell and subjected him and two other co-workers to inhuman torture on charges of theft. He sustained 19 fatal wounds caused by a blunt object and died on July 30 this year during treatment at the Hyderabad Civil Hospital. 
In a surprising move, Aalim appeared in a court in Hyderabad on Friday and announced withdrawing the charges against chief accused Kashif Commando and Huzefia Malik, the officials of the mining firm’s security company and other co-accused, informing the court that he was likely to reach an out of court settlement with the accused. 
The judges, who heard his plea, asked him to move district and sessions judge in Mithi and submit the application if he had decided in principle to pardon the accused.
Advocate Wasand Thari requested the court that his client did not want to continue with the trial and wanted to file NOC with regard to bail applications filed by the accused in the court. 
He told media persons that Aalim had decided to withdraw his application against the accused for reasons best known to him.
Sources disclosed to Dawn on Sunday that Aalim took the decision after elders of his community, including PTI leader advocate Lajpat Soorani agreed to pardon the accused in return for Rs10 million compensation for the victim’s family. “Advocate Soorani has brokered the deal between the parties on the directions of some hidden forces,” they said.
They said that Aalim had received a cheque for Rs2 million as the first installment of the compensation before submitting NOC to the court.
Advocate Soorani rejected the reports in a press statement issued to local journalists that it was he who had brokered the deal.

“Under a pre-planned conspiracy,  legislature has been weakened by placing a sword of uncertainty over its  head,” he remarked while speaking at the annual dinner programme of  the Sindh High Court Bar Association (SHCBA) on the court’s premises.
Mr Shah pointed out that earlier, the qualification to  contest the election for a National Assembly or provincial assembly seat was Pakistani nationality and  age limit; even a convicted person had the right to contest  election from jail. But now, 16 different conditions had been  imposed just to weaken the elected house, he added.
Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, a Supreme Court judge and former chief justice of the Lahore High Court also attended the programme.
CM Shah said that nomination papers of a candidate for a legislative  assembly were scrutinised and then objections were invited against the candidate  but even then the candidate, after being elected, kept facing electoral  challenges. All these pillars of the state would have to be strengthened, he stressed.
About judicial activism, Mr Shah said the contempt law had been  repealed in developed countries. Giving an example, he said that The Mirror newspaper of UK published a photograph of a judge upside down. Instead of reacting to it or issuing contempt  notice, the judge said it was true that he was old man, but as far as terming  him stupid was concerned, it would be decided by the people through  their observations, Mr Shah said.
He pointed out that powers of the executive  had been assumed by the judiciary through their verdicts and stay orders. “This has also weakened the executive,” he said.
Speaking  about his father, Syed Abdullah Shah, Mr Shah said he had  practised law within this [SHC] building and was elected chief minister  of Sindh but at the end he with extreme pain was brought to this building on a wheelchair to seek his bail in a case.
CM Shah  lauded the verdicts and the newspaper articles written by Justice Mansoor  Ali Shah while being the Lahore High Court chief justice and earlier as an advocate.
The chief minister said that being the chief executive of Sindh, he could not  claim to have not taken dictations. “But today, I feel heartened to hear  from the third pillar [judiciary] of the state that it had never taken dictations.

He was speaking at the “social media conference”, a prelude to his party’s “Shaheed-i-Islam Conference” scheduled to be held here on Nov 27.
He alleged that the PTI government had designed a calculated move to steal the vote now when it had already devastated the national economy “after entering the power corridors from the back door”.
Rashid Soomro said the ruling party had used a “dictatorial methodology” in getting its all bills passed in the recent joint session. “This government’s decisions are made somewhere else,” he remarked, and warned that JUI-F would not allow the state to become “a colony of Jews and Qadianis”.
His brother and Larkana district chief of the JUI-F Maulana Nasir Mehmood Soomro told the social media activists that the party’s Nov 27 congregation would be a huge event. It would be presided over by party chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, who is also head of the opposition alliance, the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM). He announced that leaders of PDM component parties would also attend the conference, which unanimous ask the PTI-led government to go. He criticised the government for “dancing to the tune of West”.
Nasir Soomro observed that contrary to its promise to work towards turning the state into ‘Riyasat-i-Madina’, the PTI government was leading it towards Israel. The nation would not allow them to fulfill their nefarious designs, he said, and vowed to foil all their tricks.
The JUI-F leader pointed out that skyrocketing prices of common commodities had made people’s life miserable. The only option available to the PTI government to escape people’s wrath was to step down, he said.
“People are picked up and then they remain unaccounted for but arrangements are being made to give Kulbhoshan Yadev a safe passage through the parliament,” he wondered.
By taking unconstitutional measures, the PTI government was out to mortgage the national economy with the International Monetary Fund, he alleged. He observed that the country was faced with multiple crises but the inept government was unable to overcome any of them. The country was left at the mercy of sugar, flour and other mafias, he added.
He said time had come for the nation to take to the street under the leadership of Maulana Fazlur Rehman and show the door to the “selected” government.
Abdul Razzaq Abid Lakho, Muhabbat Ali Khuhro, Maulana Mohammed Jan Magsi, Maulana Mohammed Siddiq Mugheri, Mohammed Saleem Sindhi, Hafiz Siraj Ahmed Channa, Maulana Hameedullah Siyal and others also participated in the social media conference.

They warned if the government did not accept their legal demands, they would organise a long march from the lake to the chief minister’s residence in Wahur village near Bhan Syedabad town and stage a demonstration there which might continue till the acceptance of their demands.
Manchhar Bachayo Ittehad chairman Moula Bux Mallah, who led the protest, said that increasing pollution in the lake had completely destroyed ecology of the freshwater body but the fisheries department was not making any efforts to rehabilitate it. 
He said that majority of different species of fishes had vanished and the department had also not released the fishes’ seed into the lake to help fishermen survive. The lake level was at 12 feet RL and irrigation officials were releasing water from the lake into the river, which was highly detrimental for the survival of fishes, he said.
He said that 60 reverse osmosis plants in villages around the lake had been lying closed for the past three years as huge budget for the upkeep of the plants had been embezzled. 
But no one was ready to operate the plants to supply clean water to fishermen, forcing 300,000 population of fishing community to consume the contaminated water of the lake, he said.
He said the contaminated water was causing waterborne diseases among fishermen and their families but Sindh government, DHOs and DCs of Jamshoro and Dadu districts were least concerned about providing basic health facilities to fishermen.
He said that all primary schools for girls and boys in the villages around the lake were lying closed and 15,000 children of fishermen were out of school. The education department officers had no plans to reopen the closed schools, he said.
He said that increasing salinity and pollution in the lake water had caused all fishes to vanish and diminish fishermen’s only source of income.
He demanded rehabilitation of the lake on an urgent basis and provide jobs to local fishermen.
