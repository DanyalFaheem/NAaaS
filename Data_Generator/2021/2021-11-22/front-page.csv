0,IMF may unveil steps for revival of package today,Pakistan will have to meet ‘prior actions’ for approval by Fund’s executive board.,"ISLAMABAD: With policy rate increased by 1.5 per cent, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is set to declare a staff-level agreement with Pakistan on revival of $6 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) which has been ‘in recess’ since April. 
Highly placed sources said told Dawn on Sunday that an IMF “statement [on staff-level agreement] could be released anytime shortly, most probably on Monday”. The statement would envisage ‘prior actions’ that would have to be met before the IMF’s executive board meeting to approve completion of sixth quarterly review of the programme and disbursement of $1bn, sometimes in new calendar year. 
The sources said discussions between the two sides had concluded on Friday. The announcement of policy rate by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) was the last administrative and policy action in the domain of the economic team and stood accomplished. “Everything is agreed to, ready and finished, except legislative part,” the sources said. 

Pakistan will have to meet ‘prior actions’ for approval by Fund’s executive board 

The remaining items relate to legislative work — amendment to the SBP act and taxation measures to become part of the finance (amendment) bill — for which time was required to fulfil the legislative process. On both these items, the prior action requires approval of the bills by parliament. 
While there was little difficulty on tax-related issues as the government has agreed to create additional revenue of about Rs170-180bn over the remaining part of the fiscal year on top of healthy recoveries in the first four months of the year, mostly through import-led growth, the amendment to the SBP law required teething debate and exchange of many drafts back and forth between Islamabad and Washington. 
The government team that also included Law Minister Farogh Naseem and Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance Shaukat Tarin was finally able to convince the IMF mission that a substantial level of autonomy to the SBP, especially those pertaining to protection from investigations, was already covered in the SBP Banking Services Corporation Ordinance 2001 that had been cleared by the parliamentary panels in routine and now passed by a joint session of parliament. 
Other requirements of the SBP amendment draft have significantly been modified to a middle ground and could be taken up again by another joint session of parliament, an official said. “You will see a lot of difference between the SBP draft law approved by the federal cabinet in February and the fresh draft,” said the official, refusing to go into details. 
Officials explained that the government had partially returned to the policy path given up in April 2021, albeit with certain modifications in line with the changed ground situation. The two sides were originally scheduled to conclude the talks on revival of the IMF programme on October 16 but continued face-to-face dialogue until October 28, followed by virtual discussions until last weekend. 
Shaukat Tarin had conceded last week that five prior actions had been agreed, including State Bank of Pakistan (Amendment) Bill, withdrawal of tax exemptions and an increase in energy tariff. The prior action pertaining to tariff adjustment had already been met for now with a recent Rs1.39 per unit increase in power tariff, while the bills to end tax exemptions and give autonomy to the SBP had been prepared. The next tariff increase would take place by February-March 2022 as the power regulator is still in the process of conducting public hearings on tariff adjustments. 
The government would also have to create some financial cushion during the year through sale proceeds of a few low hanging state-owned assets and ensure book adjustments in power sector entities involved in circular debt through declaration of dividends based on receivables on their accounts. 
The government would have to divert its dividend share to clear payables. This would reduce circular debt by over Rs200bn and clear balance sheets of the entities on the basis of which the government would raise global depository receipts (GDRs) in the international market. 
Shaukat Tarin had repeatedly said in recent days that the February agreement with the IMF had “tied his hands”, but according to a source close to him, he had been able to secure ‘reasonable relaxations’ without being able to change those ‘prior actions’. 
Going forward, the government has agreed to shift thousands of accounts of a number of federal and provincial government entities worth trillions of rupees into a single treasury account under a set schedule to be monitored as structural benchmarks.

1,‘Censored’ Nawaz urges need for movement to save country,Minister boycotts session in protest against the speech of an ‘absconder’,"LAHORE: A majority of the audience at the concluding session of Asma Jahangir Conference on Sunday erupted in rousing applause when it was announced that PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif would be shortly addressing the gathering live online from London.
However, enthusiasm of the lawyers chanting “Ye jo kaala coat hai, Mian tera vote hai (this black coat is your vote)” was dashed when just a few seconds into his speech, Nawaz disappeared from the screen. Mobile internet connection at the conference venue had already been suspended a short while ago, while it later transpired the broadband internet cables had been cut that eventually interrupted the broadcast.
Not giving in easily, the event organsiers managed to get Nawaz back online for a telephonic address. The PML-N supremo began by paying tribute to the late Asma Jahangir’s struggles for democracy, constitution and people’s rights. He added that he had close ties to Asma and was the last person Asma spoke to before her death.

Minister boycotts session in protest against the speech of an ‘absconder’

“If those raising questions are silenced, it won’t help solve problems,” Nawaz said, referring to the disruption in the internet service. “Unfortunately, the current era has proven to be the darkest in history for freedom of speech and human rights.”
He lamented how those speaking the truth — political opponents, journalists, columnists — are either disappeared, imprisoned, killed or sacked from jobs, TV shows and advertisements are stopped.
Referring to the former Gilgit-Baltistan judge’s allegations against former chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) Saqib Nisar, the three-time premier remarked how even judges were seeking justice now and allegedly pressured to issue verdicts against political opponents.
He lashed out at military dictators for disrespecting the constitution, laws and judiciary, carrying out political engineering and toppling governments. “We need to unite on a common national narrative of loyalty towards the constitution and following the limits prescribed in it. For this, lawyers, intellectuals, democratic forces, media, civil society, students, human rights organizations must play their roles.”
He said it was the right of the people of Pakistan to get rid of joblessness, inflation, poor economy and be provided with health, justice and education. “I have been stressing that we need to put our house in order, but the ‘Dawn leaks’ saga was staged and we were punished under false cases that led to humiliation.”
It was time to create a national agenda and give it the shape of a national movement. “I suggest that [based on] all the recommendations made at the conference, an immediate strategy be formed and everyone sit together so that the path of practical struggle is adopted. This should be done today and acted upon immediately to pull the country out of the quagmire,” he concluded.
Meanwhile, the conference organisers condemned the alleged state highhandedness of “muzzling” Nawaz Sharif’s speech. In a statement, the Supreme Court Bar Association, Pakistan Bar Council and the AGHS said the internet provider was restrained from providing the organisers with services for the conference. This included cutting off of mobile internet services in the vicinity of the venue two hours before the closing session when Mr Sharif’s speech was supposed to start. The organisers called it an onslaught on the freedom of expression.
Munizae Jahangir, journalist and organiser of the conference, said, “We believe in freedom of expression that is why this non-partisan platform is open to everyone and we condemn the muzzling of the closing session where Mian Nawaz Sharif was going to make an address.”
Reacting to the “gagging” of Nawaz’s address, PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb told Dawn: “The gag order executed by the feeble Imran Khan is a reinforcement and testimony of the failure of his incompetent and corrupt government and evident of his tyranny.” She questioned why Nawaz poses such a threat that each time his words are muted.
However, when asked about the state’s involvement in disrupting Nawaz’s address at the conference, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said: “Not that I know of.”
Earlier, Mr Chaudhry boycotted a session he was supposed to address as a keynote speaker at the conference a little ahead of schedule after he found out about Nawaz’s speech later in the day.
Hours before the session on Afghan crisis, the minister tweeted: “I have made an excuse not to attend the conference after knowing that the conference will conclude with the speech of an absconder. This is tantamount to making fun of the country and its constitution.”
Adviser to the Prime Minister on Accountability and Interior Mirza Shahzad Akbar also questioned the impartiality of the conference organisers to allow an absconder and convict to speak at an event. In a tweet, Mr Akbar wrote, “Having an absconder and convict to speak at a conference where CJP and senior judges of superior judiciary and members of Bar have spoken creates serious doubts on impartiality of organisers. The Hon’ble judges should remain clear of such politicised gatherings.”
Speaking at the session, MNA Mohsin Dawar said a humanitarian crisis was brewing on the Pak-Afghan borders as even those having Pakistani visas were not being allowed to enter from any border, and security passes being sought.
He said people had now been informed that the federal cabinet had decided that no security pass was required, but the situation at the borders had not eased. Stating that the Afghan problem was an international problem, Mr Dawar said it would not be sorted out properly, but go out of control.
Referring to a narrative in Pakistan that Taliban had popular support in Afghanistan, Mr Dawar said this could be determined by how many Afghans wanted to get out of the country. He also highlighted the discrimination, including gender based, in the Citizenship Act. “If a Pakistani man marries an Afghan woman, she is given citizenship. If a Pakistani woman marries an Afghan man, the family is not given nationality,” he remarked and added that he had twice submitted bills on the issue but they were rejected without justification.
Academic and founder of the Women and Youth Leadership Forum Orzala Nemat speaking online from Afghanistan said the situation in the country was extremely grim as over 30 million people were facing a serious economic crisis.
Ms Nemat said not only the poor, but government officials, NGO workers and other workers in different sectors were suffering. Schools, colleges and universities were closed and the staff was not able to get their salaries.
Asking what was the fault of 38 million people in Afghanistan being battered because of the mistakes of the region and international community, Ms Nemat said if the economic crisis was not resolved as soon as possible, the world would see more and more Afghan people trying to move out of the country.
Ms Nemat, who herself was a refugee in Pakistan for two years, stressed the current migration influx in the region, particularly towards Pakistan, required immediate and urgent action by the neighbouring countries and international community.
Ambassador of the European Union to Pakistan Androulla Kaminara, UNHCR Deputy Representative Tammy Sharpe and Consultant Regional Peace and Security Issues, UNDP, Simbal Khan also spoke on the occasion.

2,Operation soon to retrieve state land worth Rs5tr: PM Imran,"SAPM says forest land mapping of 30,000 square km completed, 700,000 acres found to have been intruded by land mafia.","ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Sunday vowed to launch an operation to retrieve occupied state land after the first phase of digitalised cadastral mapping of Pakistan detected massive encroachment worth Rs5.5 trillion.
“The total value of all encroached state land and those in the three major cities stood at approximately Rs5.5 trillion, whereas the land encroached in three major cities (Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad) alone was valued at Rs2.63trillion. Similarly, encroached forest land was worth around Rs1.86 trillion,” the prime minister said in a tweet while sharing, what he called, shocking facts.
“This has aggravated Pak’s existing lack of sufficient forest cover,” he tweeted.

 



 
PM Khan said just as in the case of electronic voting machines, the government faced “massive resistance” against cadastral mapping of Pakistan for digitalising land records.
“Results of Phase 1 survey of state lands shows why the resistance: phenomenal state land encroachment incl of forest land thru land mafia-pol elite connivance,” he tweeted.
With this accurate digital record, he said the government would now take action against these land mafias and their facilitators.

 



 
Earlier, in a press conference, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam said in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, around 160,000 acres of state land was encroached.
He said forest land mapping of 30,000 square km was also completed and 700,000 acres was found to have been intruded upon by land mafia.
Takhtpari Forest in Rawalpindi had a total of 2,210 acres area out of which 755 acres were encroached. Similarly, the Lohi Bher Forest had over 57 per cent (629 acres) of its total area encroached by land mafia, the prime minister’s aide said.
At the time of launching of the cadastral mapping for Islamabad in September, PM Khan had said around Rs400 billion worth of land in the capital was either illegally occupied or laid un-utilised, while almost 1,000 acres of forest land was encroached upon.
He had said the cadastral mapping of three cities would be digitised by November this year while the rest of the country would be covered in the six months after it.
Mr Khan had regretted that the country’s system did not have the capacity to retrieve illegally-occupied land from encroachers, stressing the need to establish the rule of law.
“Such a move would help attract investment from abroad,” he had said.
PM’s interview
Prime Minister Khan gave a brief online interview to a US-based Islamic scholar and co-founder of Zaytuna College, Shaykh Hamza Yusuf.
During the interview, the prime minister spoke about his international sports career and his vision being the prime minister of an Islamic state.
About arrogance, Prime Minister Khan said: “I finished education, got a degree and played internationally. Normally when you play international sports you do not study but I did both. Because I had both (sports and education) I had a bigger perspective of life.”
“If everything is sports for you and if you excel in it, you think you have conquered the world,” he said, adding that it was a natural thing, “if you excel in sports you can get arrogant”.
However, he said at the end of his sporting career, he was blessed with faith.
“Faith (Iman) is a gift of God. Not everyone has Iman. Once you have it, you have a completely different perspective of life; you attribute success to God and arrogance disappears from life,” he added.
While speaking about climate change, Prime Minister Khan said: “When you have total divorce from the sacred and you just operate on the material, which is basically what is happening in the world.”
He said climate change occurred because human beings had moved so far away from the sacred, and urged people to live in this world as they would live for a thousand years.
“I believe the whole environmental movement is sacred. If you want to be close to the Almighty you have to be humane,” he said.
When asked about political leadership, the prime minister said unfortunately a leadership came up through a political system which was also divorced from faith (Iman).
“Very few come into politics for humanity. In most of the developing world, politicians come to make money, and very few are Mandelas and our Quaid Jinnah,” he added.
“When I started politics, I had everything — enough money and fame — and for me to spend 22 years of my life struggling to become a prime minister made no sense,” he said.
PM Khan said he felt for the society and came into politics with the faith to make Pakistan an Islamic welfare state based on the State of Madina.
“I never thought of personal gains,” he added.
The prime minister said he had two major goals being the prime minister — to make the country a welfare and humane state and ensure rule of law.
The fundamental principle of a civilised society was to bring the powerful under the law, he said, adding that “all jails are filled with the poor and not by the elite”.
Responding to a question that the Pakistani diaspora in the US was said to be one of the successful communities because they had a sense of superiority not arrogance and sense of insecurity which forced them to work harder, making them disciplined, the prime minister replied: “I feel Pakistan is a country which has tremendous potential, diversified and talented ethnic groups, but due to lack of rule of law and injustice, we cannot achieve the potential of our society.”
“Since the elite had captured the system, people did not have the opportunities and a level-playing field in their own country,” he said, vowing to unleash their potential and make the country a welfare state.
“We have given the biggest welfare programme — and this is my ambition.  If we do two things — see people out of poverty and break the monopoly of mafias — the nation has great potential to excel,” he added.

3,PPP legislators call for action against six senators,Several party leaders admit it was a wrong decision of their leadership to get support from the six independents.,"ISLAMABAD: A number of senior Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) parliamentarians want its leadership to take action against those six independents who had supported Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani at the time of his nomination as the opposition leader, but ditched the opposition during the crucial voting on the electoral reforms and other bills in the joint sitting of parliament and the Senate, Dawn has learnt.
During background interviews, several PPP leaders admitted that it was a wrong decision of their leadership to get the support of the six independents and then facilitating the appointment of five of them as chairmen of various standing committees on the opposition’s quota.
All of these six independent senators elected in 2018 had been sitting on the treasury benches before the Senate elections in March and all of a sudden they submitted an application to Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani seeking allocation of seats on the opposition benches. They informed the chairman that they wanted to support Mr Gilani for the office of the opposition leader after the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) nominated Azam Nazeer Tarar for the office.
It was after getting support of this group, headed by Dilawar Khan, a senator from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, that Mr Gilani submitted his nomination as the opposition leader — a move that caused a split in the opposition Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) — and finally got the office.
The PML-N and the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) later openly criticised the PPP over this act and even termed it “backstabbing”. They claimed that the decision that the opposition leader in the Senate would be from PML-N had been taken by a PDM committee and it had nothing to do with the outcome of the elections of Senate chairman and deputy chairman, which the PDM candidates had lost.
The PPP admitted that it had previously agreed to giving the office of opposition leader to PML-N in return for nomination of Mr Gilani for the office of Senate chairman, but it said the situation changed after Mr Gilani’s defeat.
Interestingly, all these independents had voted for Mr Sanjrani in the elections, only days before their decision to sit on the opposition benches.
The PDM alleged that Mr Gilani had become the opposition leader with the covert support of the government and the senators from Balochistan who had been representing the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) in the Senate previously.
During a heated exchange of arguments with PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari in the National Assembly on June 30, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi had declared that it was the government which through its six men had helped Mr Gilani get the opposition leader’s slot.
Other members of the independents’ group are Ahmed Khan, Kauda Babar and Naseebullah Bazai from Balochistan and Hidayatullah Khan and Hilalur Rehman from the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata).
PPP Senator Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, when contacted, said he believed that the party leadership would “reconsider” its decision about these independents “who have let us down on numerous occasions”.
“There is a need for the party leadership to find out if the support of these senators had been beneficial or harmful to the party,” he said, adding that on one hand they had got the chairmanship of five committees from the opposition’s quota, on the other they joined the government whenever they wanted to.
Mr Khokhar said other opposition parties were also raising the questions as to why this group was not supporting the opposition when it was sitting on the opposition benches.
Another senior PPP senator while talking to Dawn said since the party could not take a decision whether these people would sit on the treasury or the opposition benches, it could still withdraw the chairmanship of the committees. The PPP leader said it was the responsibility of Mr Gilani to take up the matter with these independents and the leadership.
When contacted, Mr Gilani was surprisingly found confused and not well-informed on the situation when he first claimed that some of the members of this group were not present during the joint sitting and some did not vote for the government. He said he tried to contact Dilawar Khan, but was informed that he was out of the country.
Mr Gilani further said that though these independents had supported him as the opposition leader, they were sitting on the opposition benches as a separate entity. He said under the constitution and rules, the members could not vote against the party line only when there was voting on a money bill, a constitution amendment bill or a vote of no confidence. He recalled that previously despite having clear majority in the Senate and when this Dilawar Khan group was not with them, their no-confidence motion against the Senate chairman was defeated and those who had defected the opposition at that time were still sitting on the opposition benches.
In response to a question about the chairmanship of the committees, he said it was true that they had been given the position from the opposition’s quota. He, however, said that the decision to seek the support of these independents had been made by the leadership during a meeting of the party’s Central Executive Committee (CEC).
Mr Gilani recalled that the issue was discussed in detail at the CEC meeting, saying: “At one stage, I even extended my resignation, but the party leadership did not accept it.” He said the decision to seek the support of these independents had been made by the party with a “majority vote”.
“The party will take a decision and I am nobody to take a decision. Because I have not included them, but the party had done so,” maintained Mr Gilani when asked if he would recommend any action against these members.
When contacted, Dilawar Khan justified his group’s decision to vote for the government, stating that they did so because they were not taken into confidence on the issue by the opposition. He said no one from the PPP, PML-N or the JUI-F had approached them whereas ruling party senators Mohsin Aziz, Shibli Faraz, Azam Swati and even Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani begged their support on the bills.
Mr Khan disconnected the call when asked about the issue of committees’ chairmanship.
“Are you doing reasoning or what? Go away,” he said and disconnected the call.
On the other hand, talking to Dawn, PML-N’s secretary general Ahsan Iqbal said his party had left the matter to be decided by the PPP. He, however, said that it had now been proved that these six men had been sent by the government to the opposition’s ranks to create a rift.
