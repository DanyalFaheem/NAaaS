0,Extension in services of over 700 ad hoc doctors in KP delayed,Officials said that there were some observations due to which the renewal was facing delay as some doctors were doing dual jobs.,"PESHAWAR: The health department has delayed notification about extension in services of more than 700 ad hoc doctors after receiving reports that over 100 of them have not performed their duty and violated the contract, according to sources.
They said that some of those doctors had dual jobs and worked as trainee medical officers (TMOs) in violation of the contract agreement. These medical officers (MOs) were appointed in April last year and their contracts were renewed after every three months.
“Renewal of their contracts is overdue since October 30, but the department is in the process to investigate all the doctors against whom there are complaints of absenteeism from their in-charge officers in many districts,” said official sources.

Officials say contract will be renewed after removal of observations

The health department had recruited 1,122 doctors on contract. Of them, the services of 965 doctors were extended and others were terminated for dual jobs since then.
Dr Naveed Farooq Wazir, the general secretary of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Ad hoc Medical Officers Association, told Dawn that that they faced delay in getting salaries.
“We have sent a letter to finance secretary (grievance committee) of the finance department, requesting enhancement of health professional allowance like that of regular medical officers,” he said.
However, the finance department issued a notification in July to enhance the HPA of regular employees only, he said. It was against the previous notification regarding their appointment last year wherein they had been made entitled to all benefits of BPS-17 including HPA, he added.
“We haven’t been given HPA at the new rate despite working in remote districts where housing facilities are scarce due to which doctors are not willing to be posted there,” said Dr Naveed.
He said that since the first appointment, doctors had to get salaries after four months. “We called off strikes in September this year after an assurance by a delegation of the government and opposition parties regarding regularisation of our jobs, but we are still waiting for confirmation of our services,” he added.
Officials at health department said that there were some observations due to which the renewal was facing delay as some doctors were doing dual jobs and it was not allowed in the contract. They said that after removal of the observations, the department would issue directives for six months extension in their jobs.
They said that health department was also in contact with postgraduate medical institute to ascertain information about the TMOs.
Officials said that the department knew that the doctors were needed and presently they performed duty in hard areas. 
They also worked hard in Covid-19 management, therefore, renewal of their contract was approved, they said. They added that the doctors were involved in medico-legal examination in hospitals for which they weren’t authorised legally.
They said that in medico-legal examination of dead bodies and firearm injuries required the services of regular doctors, who were available to be sent to the court of law in future. The health department was waiting for the response of the relevant department before proceeding with the notification of doctors, they said.
The ad hoc doctors said that government should investigate violators of agreement but extend the contract of those working in backwards areas of the province. In the past, 5,000 doctors hired on ad hoc basis were regularised, therefore, government should remove the fear of losing jobs from the minds of doctors, who were part and parcel of the healthcare system, they said.

Addressing a workers convention in Inayat Kallay area of Khar tehsil, he said that provincial government disappointed the opposition parties by challenging the judgment of PHC about the upcoming local bodies’ elections.

He described the local government elections a contest between the anti-people government and the poor of the province. 
He said that people were suffering owing to the flawed polices of the government.
Mr Ahmed said that the upcoming polls would prove a referendum against the PTI governments both in centre and in the province. He asked the participants of the convention to use their right of vote against the PTI candidates in their respective areas.
He also criticised government for its failure to allocate three per cent share in the National Finance Commission award for the tribal districts as per the 25th Amendment.
The JI leader alleged that corruption and mismanagement increased in the tribal districts after the merger of former Fata with province owing to poor governance of the ruling the PTI.

JUI-F provincial spokesperson rules out seat adjustment with PTI

Talking to Dawn, he said that his party had been struggling against the PTI government for the last three years and it was improper for it to make alliance with the ruling party. 
“Ethically this is not suitable for JUI-F to make seat adjustment with a party against which we have been struggling for the last three years,” he said.
Jalil Jan said that electoral alliance with PTI at the district or tehsil level meant that JUI-F had lost the elections. He said that the JUI-F workers would not accept alliance or seat adjustment with the ruling party. He added that despite political differences, his party was ready for seat adjustment with PPP, ANP or any other political party.

Addressing a gathering at the QWP Secretariat here on Sunday, he said that strong supporters of PTI were changing their loyalties in different areas. He criticised the federal government and said the rulers had badly failed to provide any financial relief to the people in the face of rising inflation. 
According to a statement, Awami National Party leader Pir Sajjad Ali Shah and his supporters quit their party and announced joining QWP on this occasion. 
Mr Sherpao welcomed Sajjad Ali Shah in his party and gave him the QWP ticket for contesting the upcoming local government election for the Chamkani tehsil chairman seat in Peshawar. 
He said there was a growing sense of resentment among the have-nots who had been exposed to record inflation. He said the inconsistency in prices of essential commodities had made lives of the low-income group miserable. 
Mr Sherpao said all segments of the society, including the youth, were disenchanted with the government and claimed that the PTI candidates would face serious problems in the upcoming LG elections. 
The economic team of PTI has failed to revive the country’s economy, he said, adding that depreciation of Pak rupee against the US dollar had pushed the country’s foreign debt burden further up. He said the government was taking dictations from IMF and had raised the electricity tariff and prices of petroleum products at its behest. 
The QWP chief said the opposition Pakistan Democratic Movement would continue its struggle to oust the incompetent government as early as possible in order to provide relief to the people. He said the PTI came to power through a ‘rigged’ election and the opposition parties were not ready to tolerate it any longer.

9,Price hike hits Swat’s flea market,Daily wagers say they can’t buy jackets and shoes for winter.,"SWAT: People from different parts of Swat have complained that they are unable to buy woolies and footwear for the winter as prices of secondhand jackets and shoes have also been increased.
“Every winter I visit Landa Bazaar in Mingora to buy secondhand jacket and pullover but I am shocked to see the prices. Last year, I purchased a secondhand jacket at Rs300 but this time I cannot find any such jacket at less than Rs1,000,” Ahmad Ali, a resident of Matta, told this scribe in the bazaar.
Most of the visitors to the bazaar said that they were poor and mainly daily wagers. They added that they earned about Rs700 per day and were unable to buy the secondhand stuff for the winter season owing to the exorbitant prices.
Sardar Ali, a resident of Qambar area, who was seeking jackets for his children in the bazaar, said that first he went to shops of new jackets but turned towards Landa Bazaar when he came to know about the prices there.

Daily wagers say they can’t buy jackets and shoes for winter

“I came here and inquired about the prices of different items. The prices are high here too. I don’t know where to go to find cheap items. I cannot even afford to purchase something in Landa Bazaar. I am a peon in a private school. I cannot make both ends meet in my salary,” he told Dawn.
He said that he voted for PTI to bring change and make life easy for poor but his dreams shattered as the prices of daily use items including secondhand commodities were increased manifolds in the tenure of present government.
The vendors and shopkeepers of the secondhand items said that they bought used items at a high rate from the wholesale markets of Karachi so they had no other way but to sell the commodities at an increased price.
“We bring the used clothes and shoes from Karachi but this year the price of everything has been increased manifold. A jacket, which we used to purchase at Rs50 previously, has now reached to Rs300 to Rs400. So we cannot sell it at a low price,” said Bakht Zamin, a vendor in the bazaar.

12,view from the courtroom: Social protection needed for women in matrimonial disputes,"The Peshawar High Court, Mingora Bench (Darul Qaza), has recently taken notice of an important social issue of...","The Peshawar High Court, Mingora Bench (Darul Qaza), has recently taken notice of an important social issue of parents abandoning their daughters who move family courts for resolving their matrimonial disputes, specially seeking dissolution of their marriages, which is hitherto considered a taboo in the society. 
There are a number of such cases wherein women had to take shelter in government-run Darul Aman (shelter home) in Swat after they were abandoned by their family members because of taking matrimonial disputes to family courts. 
A two-member bench consisting of Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Justice Wiqar Ahmad took notice of the issue on Nov 9 while hearing a petition filed by an inmate of Swat Darul Aman seeking her release. She claimed that she had been kept in confinement at the Darul Aman against her will. 
The woman, belonging to Shangla district, was sent to Darul Aman by a judicial magistrate on Nov 13, 2020, on her request at that time for her safety as she had been facing life threats from her husband’s family as well as her own family members for seeking khula (separation) from her husband. She claimed that her in-laws, including her father-in-law, had been treating her badly and torturing her. 
After straying there for almost a year she moved the high court stating that she was an adult and was kept in confinement at Darul Aman. She requested the court to set her free. 
The bench accepted her plea and directed the administration of Swat’s Darul Aman to set her free. The bench also took notice of the issue as some other petitions of identical nature were also fixed before it. 
The bench noted that the respective petitioners had been lodged in Darul Aman just for the reason that they had matrimonial disputes with their spouses and for that matter they had approached the concerned family courts, but the irony was that due to that reason their parents/families had also abandoned them and even did not provide them any shelter/accommodation in their respective houses. 
“Approaching the competent court for redressal of her matrimonial grievances is right of a female and same has not only been recognised by laws of the land, but the Islamic Shariah as well,” the bench observed. 
It further observed: “We do not see any reason why parents of a lady not accept her when she seeks separation from her husband. The parents while abandoning their daughters do not think that after release from Darul Aman, where would they live and what sort of situations and perils they will face when they have no abode of their own to live in.” 
The bench now wants to devise a way out in such a predicament by seeking assistance from representatives of lawyers’ community in its jurisdiction. It has issued notices to the presidents of Peshawar High Court Bar Association, Mingora bench, Swat Bar Association and all other district and tehsil bar associations in its jurisdiction. 
The bench fixed Dec 1 for next hearing, directing that those presidents who did not find it convenient to appear before it, may apply for hearing through video link from their respective districts. 
Advocate Fazal Amin, who represented the petitioner and is also counsel in some other identical cases, told Dawn that this was in fact an important issue as women who indulged in matrimonial legal disputes often faced resistance from their parents and had nowhere to go except the government-run crisis centres. 
He said that living in a crisis centre was like imprisonment and after remaining there for some time they often moved high court for their release from there. He added that a crisis centre could not be a substitute for home and keeping an inmate there for indefinite period was impossible. 
The lawyer said that it was also a matter of concern where these women would go after coming out of Darul Aman. He said that the society needed to be made aware of the plight of such women and there should be social acceptance for those seeking settlement of family disputes through courts. 
Legal experts dealing with family laws believe that parents normally disapprove settlement of matrimonial disputes through courts by their daughters and that is a major reason for abandoning them. They believe that social protection for such females needed to be increased by the government as well as civil society groups.

In addition, newly-appointed Chief Traffic Officer (CTO) Taimoor Khan directed the officials to register FIRs against those using bogus and fake registration plates instead of issuing them tickets.
A spokesman for the traffic police said on Sunday the CTO issued directives to all circle in-charges to take action against those who do not have number plates or non-standard number plates. 
Motorcycles and vehicles with fake and bogus registration plates will be booked instead of being fi9ned, he added.
The CTO ordered DSPs and in-charges of circles to direct the traffic staff deployed at all entrances and exit points to take strict action against vehicles without any number plates and non-model number plates.
The CTO warned that the circle in-charges will be held responsible if any negligence was found on part of their subordinates.
He said besides making best arrangements for the smooth flow of traffic in the city, crime prevention, effective enforcement of traffic laws, prevention of road accidents and road users on highways would be the top priority.
“Protecting the life and property is one of my top priorities and no excuses will be accepted from citizens for tampering with the number plate and using fake registration plates,” he said, adding that the citizens were advised to use computerised number plates to avoid legal action.
