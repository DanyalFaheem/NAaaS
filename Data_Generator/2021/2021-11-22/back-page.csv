0,Sneer of cold command,The confused aesthetics of the Fatima Jinnah Park Citizen Club are merely the beginning of its sorry tale.,"

THE confusions of the bureaucracy stand mirrored in the architecture.

 
IT can be a remarkable voyage when you find that familiar places have, despite the passage of years, still managed to not yield all their secrets.   
So it was for me when I recently visited the F-9 park in Islamabad. Officially known as the Fatima Jinnah Park, it covers an entire sector in the heart of one of the oldest belts of the city. At 304 hectares (750 acres) — that apparently makes it just smaller than New York’s Central Park — it was inaugurated in 1992. At the time, it was a vast wilderness of pretty much nothing, meant to take shape over the years along the lines envisioned by its designer, Michael Japero. Kids used to go there for driving practice. Its vast expanse and early stages of development made it virtually impossible to police effectively, and apart from its parts near the gates, it was generally considered unsafe to go far inside.   
That was then. Now, it’s a flourishing place of abundant greenery, fenced all around, criss-crossed with popular walking and cycling trails, effectively a wildlife sanctuary. The acreage presents the picture of somewhat tamed wilderness, with only a few man-made compounds.  One of them is a game zone with restaurants and the opportunity of laser-tag, amongst other family-friendly pursuits. I’d been there, on occasion, over the years — to walk, to simply sit at peace and dream. The built-up areas I stayed away from, but was familiar with their exteriors. Yet, as I said, not till last week did the park disclose to me one of its secrets: the Citizen (sic; the missing apostrophe infuriates the sub in me!) Club.   
The first arresting aspect was the sheer scale of its ambition. With a covered area of 265,000 square feet, it has majestically sweeping stairwells and solid-fronted balustrades done in stone cladding, vaulting towers and imposing hallways that lead into the uncompromisingly military fortress-style building. The ageing yellow stone glowing in the late afternoon sunlight, the bear pit worthy of a Spartacus-style fighting arena (though in this case thankfully covered in lush, well-mown grass), the armed-citadel feel of the complex, charmed and awed in equal measure. It might as well have borne a plaque declaiming, I thought whimsically, “Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair.”   
That was till the eye started taking in the other details. If the complex had been designed with such an impressively bastion-like feel in mind, befitting of the capital city of a (self-avowedly) powerful country, what were wooden jharokay doing framing the balconies? If the complex was meant to be the architectural equivalent of the roar of the lion, was it necessary for it to reveal its soft underbelly? Would the commanders of such severe beauty really be standing at windows evocative of a fairytale castle? Hard or soft power? Military or fairytale? The architect, and those that approved this billion-plus rupee plan, were unable to decide, it would appear.   
Still, enough said of Nayyar Ali Dada’s design. The confused aesthetics of the Fatima Jinnah Park Citizen Club are merely the beginning of its sorry tale.   
The project was commissioned by the Capital Development Authority (CDA) in 2008. The total cost was at the time estimated at Rs1.3 billion. In 2010, when construction was nearly complete (news reports say that Rs1bn had already been spent), the Supreme Court stepped in, objecting that the building (which houses restaurants, a pool, gym, etc. on a grand scale) ought not be used as a club since that would benefit primarily the elite — much like the Islamabad Club, which is a no-go area for mortals. This structure was housed in a public park, the SC noted.   
“As a huge amount has already been spent [on the club] the CDA, with the approval of the federal government, instead of abandoning the project may utilise the building and other facilities for any public welfare project like a women’s university, medical/engineering college, science, technology or IT institution,” read the 2010 SC verdict.   
The project came to a halt. Work started again around six years ago, say news reports, but in the interim the cost had escalated by some Rs500 million. It was nevertheless completed, and from time to time, various proposals were floated as to how this behemoth should be used, amongst them a plan to convert it into a medical university. This idea was endorsed by the architect, but shot down by the CDA, which said that the establishment of a ‘national centre’ or ‘cultural centre’ (whatever that means) was under consideration.   
Fast forward to 2021 and in late July, Prime Minister Imran Khan visited the building and formed a two-member committee, comprised of CDA chairman Amer Ali and architect Mr Dada, to propose the utility of this structure — so much at the end of his tether was he. 
Currently, though, the Citizen Club does serve the people.  A few of its rooms are being used as a Covid vaccination centre, which is the context in which I went looking for it. 
Through its dark, cavernous halls echo the cries and complaints of the elderly who find the vaccination exercise here involves more physical mobility than they have, and in the lush green surroundings of the park, this building listens to the queries of confused citizens looking for answers.   
Perhaps, after all, this is in the fittingness of things. For the people, as is said, but not by them.

1,"Palestinian man kills one, wounds three in Jerusalem","Prime Minister Naftali Bennett orders security to be boosted, calls for people to be on “heightened alert”.","JERUSALEM: A member of the Palestinian Islamist Hamas movement opened fire on Sunday in Jerusalem’s Old City, killing one person and wounding three before he was shot dead, Israeli officials, police and medics said. 
Prime Minister Naftali Bennett ordered security to be boosted and called for people to be on “heightened alert” over the risk of further attacks. 
The four wounded, two police officers and two civilians, were rushed to Jerusalem’s Hadassah hospital, where one of the civilian victims died. 
“This morning there was a serious shooting attack in the Old City of Jerusalem,” Bennett said in a statement. “At the moment we have one dead and three wounded. 
“Two policewomen and one policeman quickly neutralised the terrorist.” 
The Western Wall Heritage Foundation identified the victim as Eliyahu Kay, an immigrant from South Africa, who was employed by them as a guide at the Western Wall plaza. 
The immigration ministry said he was 25 and had come to Israel in 2019. His funeral was set to take place on Monday morning in Jerusalem. 
Police said the attacker had fired a “Carlo-type weapon”, a type of submachine gun. 
After the shooting, dozens of police officers were deployed to the narrow streets of the historic walled city, as workers hosed pools of blood from the cobblestones, said a reporter. 
The Old City is in the Israeli-annexed eastern part of Jerusalem, which Palestinians claim as the capital of their future state. 
Israel captured east Jerusalem in the 1967 Six-Day War and later annexed it, in a move not recognised by most of the international community. 
Rightwing lawmakers from opposition parties organised a march on Sunday through the site of the attack. 
Israel’s Public Security Minister Omer Bar-Lev said the attacker was a Palestinian living in the Shuafat neighbourhood in east Jerusalem. 
“He was a member of Hamas, the political branch, not the armed wing,” Bar-Lev told Israel’s Kan television channel, saying the man’s wife had travelled abroad three days ago, while his son was also out of the country. 
“It seems that this attack is premeditated,” Bar-Lev said. Police identified him as a 42-year-old east Jerusalem resident.

2,Deal signed for reinstatement of ousted Sudanese PM,"Thousands of protesters, however, demand that military fully withdraw from government.","KHARTOUM: Nearly a month after Sudan’s top general ousted the prime minister, they signed a breakthrough deal on Sunday to reverse the military takeover that had sparked international condemnation and mass protests. 
Anger still flared on the streets, however, where thousands rallied again and clashed with police, shouting “No to military power” and demanding that the armed forces fully withdraw from government. 
Top General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan appeared at the presidential palace in Khartoum for a televised ceremony with a haggard-looking premier Abdalla Hamdok, who had just been freed from weeks of house arrest. 
The 14-point deal they signed officially restores the transition to civilian rule that had been derailed by the October 25 putsch which threw the poverty-stricken northeast African country into renewed turmoil. 

Thousands of protesters, however, demand that military fully withdraw from government

The agreement, which comes after crisis talks involving Sudanese and outside players, declared that Burhan’s decision “to relieve the transitional prime minister (of his duties) is cancelled” and that all political detainees be freed. 
It relaunched the fragile transition process towards full democracy that started after the 2019 ouster of veteran autocrat Omar al-Bashir. 
A frail-looking Hamdok praised the virtues of the people power “revolution” that brought him to government and declared the key priority was to “stop the bloodshed in Sudan before anything else”. 
Burhan thanked Hamdok for his services and vowed that “free and transparent elections” would be held as part of the transitional process. 
“He was patient with us until we reached this moment,” Burhan said before posing for photos with the reinstated premier and his own deputy, Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, head of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. 
The United Nations welcomed the deal but also stressed the “need to protect the constitutional order to safeguard the basic freedoms of political action, freedom of speech and peaceful assembly”. 
Outside the palace, and in other cities, thousands again rallied, met in the capital by security forces who fired teargas — the latest in a series of protests that, medics say, have claimed 40 lives. 
Police deny firing live ammunition and insist they have used “minimum force” to disperse the protests. They have recorded only one death among demonstrators, in North Khartoum. 
The main civilian bloc which spearheaded the anti-Bashir protests and signed a 2019 power-sharing deal with the military rejected Sunday’s agreement. 
“We affirm our clear and previously declared position that there is no negotiation, no partnership, no legitimacy for the coup,” said the mainstream faction of the Forces for Freedom and Change.

3,FIA arrests three CAA officials in Karachi airport land case,Arrests come after two FIRs were registered against 34 suspects.,"KARACHI: The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on Sunday arrested three officials of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and one private person in a case related to illegal occupation of several acres of land near the Karachi airport.
The arrests came after the agency lodged two FIRs against 34 nominated suspects pertaining to illegal occupation of the land whose notice was taken by the apex court in October, FIA Karachi Director Amir Farooqi said.
He said the FIA conducted raids on Saturday night and detained three officials of the CAA — the then senior estate officer Zarin Gul Durrani, the then assistant manager estate Mohammed Yunus, and the then general manager estate Syed Mohammed Kaleem — and one private person named Mushtaq.
Mr Farooqi said two separate FIRs had been registered against 34 people, including former federal minister retired Captain Haleem Siddiqi, former Karachi administrator Saqib Soomro and former Deputy Commissioner Malir Mohammed Ali Shah on complaints of CAA Additional Director Jafar Abbas Cheema.

Arrests come after two FIRs were registered against 34 suspects

According to official papers reviewed by Dawn, unknown people under the authority of Mr Shah tried to illegally take possession of the CAA land in April on the false presumption that the Survey No. 575 and 576 in NA-Class 153 Deh Mehran has been relocated on the said land, but were stopped by an airport manager.
This case has been registered against 11 people, including the then secretary land utilisation Khalid Mehmood Soomro, the then federal minister Haleem Ahmed Siddiqi and nine others, mostly government officials.
The suspects were booked under sections 409, 419, 420, 468, 471, 109 and 34 of Pakistan Penal Code read with section 5 (2) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947.
The FIR said Mr Siddiqi claimed that he had purchased five acres of lands in 1993 from Ayesha Mohammed Khan.
Another FIR registered against 23 people — including the then DCs of Malir Mohammed Ali Shah and Qazi Jan Mohammed, the then secretary land utilisation Saqib Soomro who also served as the Karachi administrator, and others — said they committed the identical offences to illegally occupy the airport’s lands in 2018.
Two officials familiar with the development told Dawn on condition of anonymity that the issue arose when Supreme Court on Oct 26 took up the issue of a marriage hall near the airport.
CAA Director General Khaqan Murtaza appeared before it and revealed that he had given an application to FIA in April, stating that around 209 acres of the CAA lands were being encroached but the FIA was not taking any action. The FIA initiated inquiry over illegal occupation of 18 acres of lands.
The officials recalled that a woman, Ayesha Mohammed Khan, purchased 64 acres of lands from private people in Deh Nara Thar district West Karachi. The then officials then relocated the woman’s lands near the airport and allotted her 15 acres of lands. Mr Siddiqi claimed that he purchased lands from the woman.
In another case, Ms Ayesha’s son, the held suspect Mushtaq, gave four acres of lands to one private person, Arslan Khalid, who started constructing boundary wall when the authorities stopped this work.
According to the FIR, the role of four private persons namely Khalid Mehmood, Amir Amin Thara, Abdul Rehman and Amanullah Memon will be “determined during the course of investigation”.
A source in the FIA said one of the private persons allegedly enjoyed support of political masters in Sindh.
