4,The advertising battle of beverages,Coke has Coke Studio and Pepsi has Battle of the Bands as music platforms ...,"Advertisers woke up and took attention as social media and digital marketing became business strategies. 
In the advertising industry, client disputes are considered to be a significant issue. When an advertising agency works for a company, it learns confidential information that it may utilise strategically, ie, share with its competitors. Knowing more about the competition may not always be helpful in oligopolistic conditions.
“Some advertisers are particular about category exclusivity, and some are happy to let it slide,” said Imran Irshad, the CEO of M&C Saatchi. “Developing a competitive advantage in a category and then getting multiple advertisers on-board is a lucrative proposition for agencies. Some agencies — not us — come up with smart strategies, such as the creation of sister brand agencies that sit in the same premises, or on-boarding separate teams within the same agency to handle multiple brands.”

Coke has Coke Studio and Pepsi has Battle of the Bands as music platforms — the issue arises when both advertisers want a specific time slot on a particular day for a specific channel

PepsiCo and The Coca-Cola Company, the market leaders in the carbonated soft drinks (CSD) category in Pakistan, are respectively served by Mindshare and Mediacom under GroupM Pakistan, headquartered in the Ocean Tower in Karachi. The teams for Mindshare and Mediacom are in the same building and are separated by floors and in some cases by cities since PepsiCo and The Coca-Cola Company are based in Lahore.
“The clients need to understand that there are endless possibilities to make a relationship transparent,” said Rizwan Merchant, the founder & CEO of M2 Pakistan. “Client needs to know what they require from the agency and get it audited through specialised media auditor firms.”
When serving advertisers in the same category, naturally, a media agency must decide which client to favour. The most natural variable to measure is which client represents the most significant chunk of the media group’s business. In the case of Pepsi vs Coke, sources shared that Pepsi has a media budget that is nearly Rs2.5 billion while Coca-Cola spends under Rs1bn on its advertising expenditure (AdEx). 
According to the Pakistan Media Outlook 2021 report from Brainchild Communications Pakistan, the print AdEx by companies in the beverages category constituted just 2 per cent of the overall print AdEx of 2020.
But things are more complex: Pepsi sponsors cricket locally, Coke does so internationally. Both have music platforms, namely Coke Studio and Battle of the Bands. And they will have to find their way amid a plethora of advertiser specific operating principles. These include rates, music platforms, sports sponsorships and exclusivity.  
Coke has Coke Studio, and Pepsi has Battle of the Bands as music platforms. Here arises an issue when both firms want a specific time slot on a particular day for a specific channel.
“The brand essence, positioning and future growth plans drive the platform and strategy selection,” said Mr Asgher. “It is a co-created process between the advertiser and their media partners.”
Sports Sponsorships: Coke is an international sponsor of cricketing events, while Pepsi is often a principal local sponsor. If both want the first 10 seconds of the first ad break, that can create a deadlock, and if Pepsi being the main sponsor of a tournament, gets 60pc of airtime, and Coke wants the 1st spot of every break. It will further complicate the situation. 
Exclusivity: In general, certain exclusive events require category exclusivity. An example of these events is Ramadan, Eid, August 14th, etc. For these events, it’s always offered to one category leader and the first right of refusal. 
“We have our own air-tight protocol,” said a GroupM Pakistan representative.  
When advertisers choose to adopt a periodical media audit through firms that have insights into agency operations and understand the client-agency relationship’s intricacies, relationships between competing categories can become transparent. Till then, advertisers will continue to choose to jump the gun and complain after the fact.

5,Gamers as breadwinners,"Pakistan is ranked 29 out of 150 countries for e-sport earnings, with 278 local players earning a combined total of $4.78m","Boomers and late millennials might look askance at the ludicrous numbers thrown around for the gaming industry in Pakistan. 
For example, the top-earning Pakistani gamer, Sumail Hassan, has earned $3.8 million playing Dota 2. At the current exchange rate, this is over Rs675m (67.5 crores in case you are doing the maths) — far more than an average Lahore University of Management Sciences grad will earn in his lifetime working for a coveted multinational company.
Globally worth roughly $200 billion with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.64 per cent, the gaming industry is entirely overlooked in Pakistan. While tech exports have crossed $2bn, the share of the gaming industry is minuscule. In contrast, Turkish gaming companies, for example, have raised $238m this year, according to a LinkedIn post by Babar Ahmed from Lion Studio, a mobile publishing studio based in the US.

Pakistan is ranked 29 out of 150 countries for e-sport earnings, with 278 local players earning a combined total of $4.78m

About 12,000-15,000 individuals are working in this industry, extrapolates Samar Hasan, co-founder of Epiphany Games, from the data made available by the unpublished International Game Developers Association report. The study estimates up to $25m is earned locally across the industry each year.
Pro-gaming is an important segment of the gaming industry, of which e-sports (electronic sports) is a sub-category.  Pakistan is ranked 29 out of 150 countries for e-sport earnings, with 278 local players earning a combined total of $4.78m. Streaming of games is a revenue channel in itself — think the cricketers of the Pakistan vs India world cup match and the millions who were watching it, only in this case the entire experience is online.
Similar, a related field is e-casting and talk shows where the legendary players are not Wasim Akram arguing with Waqar Younis over korma while Fakhre Alam mediates but Gen-Xers and millennials talking about feats of thumbs and fingers.
And where there are billions of players (3.24bn gamers across the globe) and audience members, there is monetisation and advertisement revenue. “E-sport are not mainstream. In other countries there are proper academies — it is taught at the school level,” says Ms Hasan.
Game design and development is another big category, mostly concentrated in Lahore. “But if Pakistan is producing 20,000 IT graduates every year, they mostly work for software houses because there is a lack of awareness,” laments Ms Hasan. Unsurprising, given that most universities here do not teach game development as a proper degree programme. The dearth of skill set has made gaming studios wary of interacting in fear that the limited talent pool will be poached by other developers.
Another important category is the gamification of different industries. “Imagine a game in which different financial concepts can be explained, for example, saving. 
The main characters save up and then invest in a shop or spend on clothes. Different scenarios could be created incorporating financial products and the consequences of choices made,” explains Ms Hasan.
Though mostly aimed at kids, according to statistics by Growth Engineering, gamification can apply to diverse sectors from climate change to education. With a whopping global CAGR of 27.4pc, it is expected to grow to $30.7bn by 2025 but is virtually non-existent in Pakistan.
“Pakistan is stuck in providing services and games as products,” says Ms Hasan. Programmers and designers put together a game and give it to some international publisher who then proceeds to take home the bulk of the revenue.
Pakistan’s expertise lies in hyper-casual games like Ludo or Candy Crush. The ad revenue of the millions of downloads however accrues to the publisher. Furthermore, instead of innovation and creativity, cloning is more common where a local developer takes the concept of candy crush but uses jewellery instead of candies.  
Similar to most small sectors bemoaning their fate, game developers lack access to capital. Strategy and battlefield games that involve complex worlds can require an investment of millions of dollars whereas a small hyper-casual game can be made in a week for $2,000-4,000.
Pakistani has about 200 gaming studios, estimates an industry insider, almost all of which are led by men. But the gaming industry can be incredibly inclusive, asserts Ms Hasan who is advocating for equality in the industry. “A game designer is absolutely critical for any game. The person is the architect of the game, setting the storyline, progression of levels and personas of the characters. A writer or historian with no tech background could pitch in as a core team member for game development.”
Since Pakistan serves the international market, there are no local games — for example, Babar, Humayun and Akbar riding dinosaurs and beheading zombies to protect Agra from invading hordes. Or auxiliary areas of artificial and virtual reality tours of hiking up Pakistan’s Nanga Parbat explains Ms Hassan.
A whole host of professions that parents grew up learning about are giving place to novel forms of employment. Maybe it is time to shove the Pythagoras theorem to one side and hand your kid a gaming console for her next birthday.

6,It’s time to come clean,"The Public Accounts Committee, keeping the sensitivity of the issue in sight, must diligently follow through on the audit report.","EVERYBODY expected the PTI government to come clean on the issue of funds that floated around the Covid crisis because it was a grave situation that was managed very well; much better than most around the globe. Sadly, however, it was not to be. The Auditor-General’s (AG) report on Covid spending underlined irregularities, causing financial losses and performance setbacks in the initial three-month period of FY20, from March to June.
The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of Parliament, keeping the sensitivity of the issue in sight, must diligently follow through on the audit report. It has to be precise and quick rather than verbose and long-winding. The matter cannot be allowed to drag endlessly. Making it sharp will ensure that mistakes were not repeated, restore public confidence and assuage donor concerns. 
“This was a once-in-a-century health crisis that rattled the world. In an emergency situation of such a magnitude, disruption in routine order of business could have been explained. But the AG office was denied access to documents by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and other government agencies involved in relief and revival work, and that has raised suspicions,” said a rare PTI sympathiser in the bureaucracy.
“The AG office had to publish the report with observations of non-cooperation. It cited instances of overstepping the mandate by the focal body and aligned executing agencies involved in the Covid-related drive,” he added. 

Despite the fact that the federal cabinet has rejected the audit observations related to Covid management, there are questions in many a mind

“The government made another cardinal mistake by trying to hide a published official document from the public’s eye. How can you do that? It is a sad commentary on the conduct of a democratic government that it presented the undated AG’s report in National Assembly under International Monetary Fund’s pressure,” commented a source in Islamabad privy to affairs of the Public Account Committee (PAC).
The report was tagged on AG’s official website only last week. As soon as its contents were reported in the media, the federal cabinet hurriedly rejected it.
“The rejection by the cabinet means nothing as it is up to the PAC, a bipartisan body chaired by Pakistan Muslim League (N)’s member national assembly (MNA) Rana Tanvir Hussain (headed ideally by the leader of the opposition), to discuss, investigate, form an opinion and make recommendations. The work of our office ends once the report is published,” a source in the AG office in Islamabad said while explaining the procedure.
The AG report on Covid observed lack of government preparedness, instances of mis-procurements, delays in delivery of purchases, weak financial controls, absence of proper record-keeping, reluctance in sharing relevant documents, unauthorised tax and duty breaks, weak warehousing management, data glitches resulting in cash transfers to undeserving persons, unnecessary advance payments to suppliers, double cash grant payments, unjustified pre-qualification of flour mills by the Utility Stores Corporation and procedural lapses.
The government’s over-reaction to the AG’s report was interpreted as an attempt to dissuade the auditors from undertaking a similar exercise related to the Covid management in FY21. Some businessmen reached out for comments believed that the PTI “must have bungled big time” to be acting the way it is. “It’s amply clear that the official team does not want audit hounds sniffing around the Covid business,” a top businessman said.

When reached over the phone, Dr Sania Nishtar, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Poverty Alleviation, denied violations of rules or financial lapses in the disbursements made under the Ehsaas Emergency Cash (EEC) programme to the deserving families in the wake of Covid-induced lockdowns. She sounded disturbed and regretted that the negative remarks in media had demoralised the “dedicated staff who worked beyond the call of duty during the toughest phase of the pandemic” in providing relief to the needy. 
She took time walking this scribe through each of the 10 objections on the Ehsaas programme and countered each of them. She also shared a five-page explanatory note wherein all objections have been contested.
To a question why were these paragraphs not settled with the audit team before the publication of the report if evidence-based clarification was available, she said the departmental audit committees (DACs) had ended abruptly without the final closure meeting.  
From initiation to completion, a special audit is a long-drawn process carried out in accordance with the laid out procedures. It was not clear why the AG team hurried a report on an issue that is of global interest. As things stand, the ball is now in PAC’s court.
The credit for the success of the Covid strategy is shared by all political parties. The fact that the PPP set the path is beyond doubt. In the end, it was better coordination and cooperation between the federal and sub-federal tiers with the induction of information communication technology that saved lives and livelihoods and protected the country from a possible catastrophe. The PAC must play the role expected of it in a democracy at a time when the whole world is watching.
Dr Nishtar insisted that no irregularity had been committed in the Ehsaas disbursements. Besides, there were no allegations by the audit team of mis-procurement, no violations of procurement codes, no violation of rules, no financial mismanagement, no loss to the exchequer, no wasteful expenditure, no overpayments, no unauthorised retention, and no instances of “non-production of records”. In short, no corruption in the Ehsaas programme.
“The initiative was launched within days of the Covid lockdown. It has been highly rated globally as one of the global best. Despite its massive scope both in terms of coverage and fiscal quantum in the context of strict lockdowns, there were only 10 audit observations related to Ehsaas (largely recommendations of an advisory nature); these were raised due to dependency on other allied institutions.”
The focal organisation, NDMA, which established the well-known National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) and handled the Covid-related budget and its disbursement, was approached for comments. Its response did not reach Dawn till the filing of this report despite repeated reminders.

7,"Confluence of policy, market failure",It is no less than a crime that refineries keep crying over low capacity utilisation due to unneeded imports of finished products.,"


 
ON the heels of the sudden surge in inflation beyond expectations and a record trade deficit, Prime Minister’s adviser on finance and revenue Shaukat Tarin came out in the public to pump possible confidence to the markets that were seen rapidly shedding value of rupee and share prices. 
He expects the foreign exchange reserves to reach $20.5 billion in a couple of weeks from about $16bn at present with $3bn inflows from Saudi Arabia, replacement of a recently matured $1bn Sukuk bond and some Eurobonds soon. In his view, the fundamentals of the economy are also showing strength as revenues grow and agriculture, services, industry and construction sectors show growth.
He was candid and diplomatic at the same time about the double whammy. He appeared incessantly parking some responsibility on the legacy he carried over from his predecessor and the recent policy directions from the central bank to which he plans to ensure full autonomy through an act of parliament within days. But then he would shrug off suggestions for accountability on the grounds that he did not believe in ‘witch-hunt’ but course correction.
The shares market has generally been in a tailspin since the International Monetary Fund announced to have reached a staff-level agreement with Pakistan’s authorities two weeks ago but a record 2,200 points plunge last Thursday alone sent a shock wave among the government rank and file. The finance adviser also accepted that there were uncertainties in the market because of double-digit inflation, currency depreciation, interest rate hike and higher import bill — a situation that was quite different at the time of the budget five months ago. The new budgetary measures would take 8-10 days to reach parliament for approval, according to Mr Tarin.
Editorial: Investors' perceptions had as much to do with PSX bloodbath as worsening economic indicators

Shaukat Tarin conceded policy fault lines while reporting that the biggest $508m contribution to the $1.4bn higher import bill was fuel imports of products that could be produced locally

He conceded policy fault lines while reporting that the biggest $508 million contribution to the $1.4bn higher than the previous month increase in imports was fuel imports — products that could be produced locally with a foreign exchange saving. 
It is no less than a crime that domestic refineries keep crying over low capacity utilisation due to unnecessary imports of finished products — petrol, furnace oil, jet fuels. With no improvement in Furnace Fuel Oil (FFO) dispatches, some of the refineries have reported that they were left with no option except to curtail refinery throughput. In case there is no improvement in the upliftment of FFO in the next few days, these will be forced to shutdown distillation units one by one ultimately leading to total shutdown, they have warned.
The refineries have expressed surprise that huge volumes of FFO had been and were “being imported on one hand and on the other hand FFO from local refineries was not being lifted”. The independent power producers which are bound by their agreements to maintain FFO inventory for thirty days are also not being pushed by the regulatory authorities for uplift from local refineries. Huge circular debt piling up at Rs2.42 trillion is the key reason. This is a poor show of planning and coordination, to put it politely.
Higher international prices of crude and liquefied natural gas (LNG) are no doubt a key reason though. The oil prices are on the decline from the recent peak. The current import exposure of the petroleum sector is about $22-23bn per annum in the shape of imports of crude, finished products, LNG and liquified petroleum gas (LPG). There are few low hanging fruits but then vested interest plays a critical role.
It does not require intricate economic models to suggest maximum capacity utilisation of local refining capacity through higher crude imports rather than finished products. The ministries and cabinet committees have been wrangling over a new oil refining policy for almost a year that could have encouraged the upgradation of existing refineries and the setting up of additional refineries.
About 25 per cent lower arrangements than required LNG quantities in a timely manner also has to be taken into account. The private sector has been running from pillar to post for medium to long term terminal and pipeline capacity to arrange its own LNG import quantities but has only met with resistance. 
Some savings have, however, been made in providing maximum natural gas — both local and imported — to fertiliser production as it has now been reprioritised at par with export and power sectors. It would get an uninterrupted supply of about 760mmcfd even in peak winter months to keep all fertilisers up and running. The price differential between local urea and imported one roughly works at Rs1,800 and Rs7,000 per 40kg bag.
Suddenly, the energy ministry is referring to only one business group as the panacea for all energy challenges including those relating to LPG production, virtual pipelines for LNG supplies and facilitation to additional business to business arrangements within the existing LNG terminals. The smaller groups like the compressed natural gas (CNG) sector are being pushed to bow instead of seeking their own imports. In the process, a major Japanese player which might have led to market competition through additional terminal capacity appears to have been forced out at the last moment.
Mr Tarin has also attributed prevailing anxiety in the market to the increase in the discount rate to 8.75pc by the State Bank of Pakistan along with the announcement that monetary policy frequency has been reduced from eight to six weeks and maybe further reduced to a month. Based on this direction along with inflation at 11.5pc, the market anticipated a further increase in the discount rate and expected T-Bill’s rate at 10.75pc to go up further and hence the market players increased their pricing. 
He put on record that the governor state bank did not agree that banks were involved in profit-taking in the exchange rate but he had shared data along with their profitability that would hopefully convince the central bank to take action.

8,Pension stasis and renaissance,Our government cannot and should not replicate the Social Security system of the US or public pension funds of Canada.,"Private pensions are in stasis. There are three straight-forward remedies — a trade body to represent employer-sponsored funds (EFs), one national regulator and an income solution without liabilities. Delay of public pension reform should not hold back reform of private pensions. 
The two broad categories of private pensions in Pakistan are Voluntary Pension System (VPS) and EFs. The latter category includes provident funds (PFs), gratuity and superannuation funds. 
The EFs are a regulatory orphan today as no government entity takes their full ownership. They have to deal with multiple authorities — provincial government under the new trust act, the Federal Board of Revenue for tax exemption and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) for filing requirements. 
The result is a Dickensian tale of two cities. Many large EFs follow global best practices. The ones sponsored by small private companies lie bruised and broken. 
The VPS falls under the exclusive domain of the SECP. It is managed by Asset Management Companies (AMCs) whose representative body, ‘Mutual Fund Association of Pakistan (MUFAP)’, is great at advocacy. The regulator is deeply engaged and actively supportive. The VPS is well run with uniform standards.

Just as a mule cannot gallop no matter how well-fed and well trained, a flawed pension design cannot gain traction no matter how good are its regulations and fund managers

But here lurks the danger. The VPS is an individual account-based system and the EFs are pooled arrangements. A pooled arrangement is vastly superior to an individual account-based system. The regulatory abandon of the EFs and organised support of the VPS has led to a tax policy that penalises PFs and favours VPS. We are starving a horse and feeding a mule. 
Individual accounts versus pooled arrangements
The purpose of pensions is to deliver lifetime income. This necessitates the use of structures that can maximise savings for workers and deliver a higher lifetime income to retirees. 
Two questions follow naturally. Which structures have lower costs? Who should manage investment risks? 
A pooled arrangement unbundles various services. It has significantly lower costs as trustees can outsource certain services and choose different vendors. A pooled fund is the preferred option for governments and employers globally. Assuming a neutral tax rate and a 35-year employment period, a PF can deliver 25 per cent higher savings than the VPS. 
The trustees, who typically are among the most informed members of the workforce, manage investment risk or asset allocation in a pooled fund. They have skin in the game as their personal savings are part of the pool. They can avail the best investment expertise. Their collective decision making is unemotional, reflective and long-term. 
Board supervision is easy. A review of one pooled fund means a review of each employee’s nest egg. 
An individual account-based system is at the opposite spectrum. Each participant is free to choose asset allocation. The nexus between the trustees’ individual portfolio and employees’ savings is broken. As behavioural finance rightly predicts, the vast majority of participants fall victim to emotional blunders — fear and greed, overconfidence, market timing, recency bias, narrow framing etc. 
Occasional investment seminars arranged by employers fall on deaf ears. The burden of managing nest-egg creates unhealthy distractions and lowers productivity. Board members have limited interest beyond compliance matters as they cannot influence an employee’s asset allocation. 
The upshot is that the median savings in an account-based system will not just be lower but participants of the same age cohort and similar salary will have significantly different balances. Is that a desirable or a fair outcome? A lower accumulated balance means a lower income for life.
No surprise that the VPS is unpopular among employers. Just as a mule cannot gallop no matter how well-fed and well trained, a flawed pension design cannot gain traction no matter how good are its regulations and fund managers. 
Chile is a great example of what can go wrong in an individual-account based system. After many decades, the system has delivered dismal savings, inadequate income, brought people to the streets, forced the government to allow the use of pension pot for current consumption and sown seeds of a bigger crisis. The results would be very different had Chile followed the Dutch model of employer-based funds. 
The results of 401 (k), a similar but non-mandatory system managed by employers in America, have also been dismal for the vast majority of participants. But US citizens have a safety net called Social Security — a pooled system — which gathers all payroll taxes and delivers lifetime income. 
Pension renaissance
The first step is to create a trade body to represent the EFs just like the MUFAP. Membership should be mandatory to avail tax benefits. It is farcical that the EFs currently have no forum to come together and communicate with the government. Financial institutions and their connected persons should not be allowed to become office bearers of this trade body.
The second priority should be to place the EFs and the VPS under the same regulatory ambit. This move will at once create regulatory neutrality and a holistic perspective in policymaking. 
The single regulator will have every reason to build a broad and deep intellectual capital in behavioural finance, income solutions, profit versus non-profit pension models, implications of high cost and international failures and successes. Mastery of these topics is a prerequisite for providing a clear roadmap for supportive legislation and tax reform. 
The EFs need regulatory support and oversight. They all must be made to operate under a custody arrangement to prevent deviant conduct of small companies. Tax credits to participants should not discriminate between the VPS and PFs. The leakages from the VPS and PFs are significantly draining our national pension pool and this must stop. 
There is a risk. A newly created single regulator can over-reach and burden the already good EFs with unnecessary regulations instead of curing the malaise in smaller companies. But this is a risk we must take. A well-functioning trade body, trial and error and a self-correcting regulatory mindset will produce the pension Derby winners that our country so badly needs.
The third priority is to choose one mandatory structure for lifetime income. As outlined in these columns previously, modernised tontines are the best option for lifetime income in emerging markets like Pakistan. Tontines are easier to regulate. They do not create liabilities. They can be easily adapted to the Shariah rules. They deliver a higher payout than an annuity. 
Local capital markets are not ready for annuity solutions. Fixed annuities are not possible without liquidity in 20-year to 30-year fixed coupon sovereign bonds. A menu of variable annuities will force unqualified individuals to make irreversible choices on different asset classes. 
The low and negative interest rates in Japan since the 1980s and now prevalent in Europe and America should be a warning sign to any proponent of variable annuities. 
Our government cannot and should not replicate the Social Security system of the US or public pension funds of Canada. Instead, it should move immediately to create a trade body for EFs, place all private pensions under one national regulator and legislate tontines for lifetime income. 
A well-designed pension system can wrest back the financial freedom of our country in thirty to forty years and deliver a dignified retirement to our future generations. 
Continuation of the status quo will keep us in the beggar zone forever.

9,Why special economic zones are underperforming?,"All government tiers, departments and state institutions will have to make joint efforts to help SEZs deliver.","Pakistan has an edge over some other countries — or it equals them — when we look at the facilities available to foreigners in starting and doing business in Special Economic Zones (SEZs).
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has highlighted Pakistan’s strength in this regard in a special section of its annual economic review of 2021 that ended in June. Citing a 2017 World Bank report on SEZs, the SBP has enumerated all the plus points of our SEZs compared to those of Vietnam, India, Indonesia and Bangladesh. A cursory look at SEZ facilities in Pakistan and in the above-listed countries reveal that Pakistan should not be lagging behind them in generating enough forex earnings from its seven operational SEZs.
For example, import duty on SEZ-specific imports in Pakistan is zero whereas in the case of Indian and Bangladeshi SEZs it is 100 per cent. Similarly, in Pakistan’s SEZs, exemption from corporate tax is available for 10 years against five years in the case of India, four years in the case of Vietnam — and just two years in the case of Bangladesh. 
Why then it is so that cumulative gross earnings from our seven SEZs — right from the year they began operations till June 2021 stood below $10 billion? And when we talk about net exports (exports minus imports meant for SEZs) the total forex earnings comes to just $4bn. 

Cumulative gross earnings from our seven SEZs — right from the year they began operations till June 2021 stood below $10 billion whereas net exports were just $4bn

One of our seven SEZs ie Karachi Export Processing Zone (KEPZ) has been operating for the past 40 years. All others are younger in age but even the youngest one — Duddar EPZ — is 12 years old. 
Isn’t then $4bn net exports and $10bn gross exports in these long years from seven SEZs — four meant for multiple sectors and three for specific sectors — quite shocking? What is equally shocking is that as of June 2021, only 34,100 workers were employed in 310 companies of all seven SEZs — 30,000 of them in 266 companies of KEPZ.
One basic reason for the low level of net export earnings and low level of employment generation in SEZs lies in the small number of SEZs. (Several countries boast of much greater numbers of SEZs — Philippines 528, India 373, Thailand 74, Malaysia 45 and Bangladesh 39, according to a 2019 United Nations Conference on Trade and Development report).
But poor physical infrastructure facilities in SEZs including in KEPZ, inconsistencies in industrial and trade policies, uncertainties in supply of gas, electricity and water — and above all bureaucratic red-tape and corruption also impede faster exploitation of SEZs’ economic potential. The Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce & Industry and Pakistan Business Council have repeatedly sought redressal of these issues from every successive government. But little improvement has taken place so far. After the 18th Constitutional Amendment that took effect from 2010-11, addressing SEZs issues has become even more challenging because of the overlapping role of the federal and provincial authorities in providing and maintaining infrastructure facilities and utilities to SEZ-based companies.
The SBP report on SEZs boasts of the fact that in the first five months of this year a record 70 enterprises have been enlisted as active units of SEZs — after the launching of the Special Economic Zone Management Information System in January. In the absence of this system, only 200 enterprises have got this status in the past eight years.
While this is a very healthy development, just granting the companies active status in SEZs is not enough to ensure a greater and faster contribution of SEZ-based companies to Pakistan’s economy. To ensure that the state will have to take full ownership of SEZs. 
And, federal, provincial and city governments and all state institutions and government departments will have to make joint efforts to help SEZs deliver. That is a tall order, keeping in view the ground realities of our geopolitics and geo-economics. 
Pakistan now seems eager to shift its diplomatic focus from geopolitics to geo-economics. Though this shift in focus may take years to materialise even partly, the development of country-specific SEZs can be one of the baby steps. Rashakai SEZ (in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), launched at the end of May this year under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) offers one good example of country-specific SEZs. Three other SEZs under CPEC are also at various stages of development each one in Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan — all under CPEC. Given Pakistan’s wide and deep economic ties with the US, UK, GCC and some European Union countries, many more country-specific or regional bloc SEZs can — and should — be developed.
Apart from some genuine geopolitical limitations, Pakistan continues to suffer from developing SEZs in specific sectors or for specific countries. The lack of focus on obtaining real results from SEZs also continue to mar the entire SEZ management regime.
Whereas SEZs currently being developed under CPEC can be expected to operate (after becoming functional) under a closer watch of CPEC Authority, what about already operational old SEZs? 
The Export Processing Zone Authority (EPZA) came into being forty years ago. “Its main objectives,” according to EPZA’s own admission, “are accelerating the pace of industrialisation” and “enhancing the volume of exports by creating an enabling environment for investors to initiate ambitious export-oriented projects” in EPZs.
Buried under this grandiloquence, however, remain unpleasant facts about the poor state of industrialisation, exports and investment in the country. The government will do well to require EPZA to begin issuing periodical public reports on how it has been managing the affairs of EPZs and why things stand where they stand now.

10,Plight of small farmers in Attock,Agriculture is a subsistence activity for those unable to make it to the military or abroad...,"


 
A historic settlement Attock is the eastern terminus of the River Kabul, which joins River Indus close to the old town. The district located at the border of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is a natural corridor to Central Asia carved out by the Kabul River and its tributaries through the Hindu Kush mountains. At least 14 historical sites, including Gurudwara Punja Sahib — a sacred place of Sikhism at Hassan Abdal — highlight its religious and cultural importance.
Kamra Aeronautical Complex and Sanjwal Ordnance Factories are other claims to fame for the district that offer employment opportunities to the locals and provide defence equipment, services and ammunition to Pakistan Army and Air Force. It also houses some cement, textile, engineering goods and glass manufacturing units. The discovery of the largest oil and gas reserves in 2017 in the Jhandial area has only added to its significance while an oil refinery has been in operation there for decades.
Bounded by Haripur and Swabi districts of KP in the north, Rawalpindi in the east, Chakwal in the south, Mianwali in the south-west, Kohat in the west and Nowshera in the north-west, it was given the status of a district by the British back in 1904. In fact, it had been named Campbellpur after Sir Campbell, who founded a new settlement close to old Attock town. It was renamed Attock in 1978.
Awans, Pathans, Ghebas, Jodhras, Khattars, Gujjars, Mughals, Sheikhs, Syeds and Rajputs are major tribes or castes residing in the district and except Rajputs, most others claim to be descendants of the invaders from Afghanistan and Central Asia. The battle between Mahmud Ghaznavi and Rajputs had been fought on the plain of ‘Chhachh’, between Hazro and Attock along the Indus in AD 1008. It ended in the defeat of the Rajput confederacy and thus the sub-continent fell to the invading Muslims from Afghanistan.

Agriculture is a subsistence activity for those unable to make it to the military or abroad — the average yield is much lower than the provincial average

Spanning over 6,856sqkm and generally barren with poor vegetation and thinly wooded, the district is a combination of hills and plains — hilly in the north-west and south. Of the hills, the Kala Chitta range is rich in mineral resources like argillaceous clay, gypsum, bentonite, fireclay, limestone, silica sand and iron ore.
An overwhelming majority of the farmers are small landholders as 79 per cent of households own less than 7.5 acres of land each. Around 83pc of them are self-operators. Of the total 778,431 acres of cultivated land, only 43,818 acres or just 2.53pc of the cultivable land is canal fed and the rest of the area is arid depending upon rains for irrigation purposes. The cultivable wasteland is around 100,081 acres, while over 160,000 acres or 9.45pc of the area is under forest cover.
Wheat and gram hog major share, while groundnuts, chickpeas, oilseeds, mung and mash pulses are also being grown. But, none of them yields enough to make the district or its inhabitants part of the provincial, let alone national, commodity market. Agriculture is a subsistence activity for those unable to make it to the military or abroad. The average yield is much lower than the provincial average.
Wheat, for example, was sown on 497,000 acres last year, and the Punjab Crop Reporting Service recorded its average yield at 17.8 maunds against the provincial standard of 32 maunds per acre. Maize, which took over 28,000 acres, fared better last year with 29.89 maunds; up from 12.90 maunds for the last many years, whereas the provincial average is over 80 maunds per acre.
This poor and inconsistent yield also highlights the increasing irrelevance of agriculture when it comes to surviving strategy in an area that is largely dependent on weather moods. Weather assumes added significance in an area that is mainly rain-fed, partly irrigated and partly tube-well-dependent. A total of 32,000 open wells and tube wells are functional in the district. The potential for rainwater harvesting is high in Tehsil Pindi Gheb and Jandas where a large number of small basins/ catchments exist. Besides 14 perennial streams and nullahs, 15 small and 30 mini dams, 200 ponds have been built and 500 lift irrigation schemes have been executed to meet the irrigation needs of the area. Drip irrigation, sprinkle irrigation and roof harvesting technologies are also being introduced.
Groundnuts, a historical speciality of the area, seem to have largely disappeared because of old varieties that yield too little to make commercial sense. It is being replaced by potato crop, whose acreage has gone up manifolds, from 2,380 to 16,000 acres, during the last three decades.
Some growers are also experimenting with citrus, guava and apricot orchards and over 1,300 acres are reported to be under them. Vegetables, besides potatoes, are mainly grown in Hazro tehsil and around the urban centres of the district. These include cauliflower, onion, garlic, bottle gourd, brinjal and peas.
The massive cultivable waste provides huge potential but lacks land integration effort, which is necessary to give agriculture commercial viability. Otherwise, small pieces of land would continue to be wasted on wheat and maize with no one benefitting.
Shoaib Wardag, a local landlord, says that the agriculture authorities need to run a massive farmer education campaign for persuading and training them to turn to high-value crops instead of practising the centuries-old wheat and maize crops system. The government should step in for training the farmers in tunnel farming system for growing vegetables and subsidising the required stuff to enable small landholders with meagre resources to maximise the potential of their lands as well as earnings as soils along Kabul and Indus river banks are fertile, so are tracks falling between hills and acres served by dozens of lakes and dams dotting the district, he adds.
Muhammad Umar, a tenant in Hazro tehsil, bemoans of lack of the government’s neglect towards their plight. He says that their crops are being damaged due to hailstorms for the last three consecutive years but the area has never been declared as calamity-stricken and thus peasants fail to get any compensation from the government.
He asserts that subsidies worth a couple of thousands of rupees on the purchase of fertiliser is not enough to make agriculture for smallholders sustainable and for alleviating rural poverty; rather the government should focus on the provision of quality seed and other farm inputs at highly subsidised rates.
Since the agriculture sector is poverty-stricken, its sub-sectors are even poorer. With less than half a million large animals (301,648 cows and 75,837 buffalos) and half a million small animals (306,423 goats and 170,408 sheep) as per the 2018 livestock survey, the district hardly has anything to boast about. Some investment did come into the dairy sector but ran out of steam as neither manpower nor fodder is available at commercial scale, say local livestock officials.
The area under fodder crop has shrunk from 10,400 acres to 3,800 acres in the last two decades or so as more and more agricultural land is being consumed by mushrooming housing schemes particularly around those urban centres located along the Grand Trunk Road and Abbottabad Road, protests Shakeel Ahmed, deputy director agriculture (extension). Some farms are still surviving but none of them is turning out to be a commercial attraction. However, backyard poultry is flourishing on official subsidy.
There is a need for offering loans on easy terms to attract educated youth towards dairy farming and financial institutions should come up with tailor-made products suitable for the local requirements, Mr Wardag suggests.

11,Unplanned urbanisation in Karachi,Rough estimates have shown that Karachi has expanded over 50 times since independence in 1947.,"Unplanned urbanisation is an unnoticed phenomenon that has long plagued Pakistan. Many misconceptions are prevalent in Pakistani society hampering the country’s prosperity. Once such misconception happens to be urbanisation and its quintessential necessity for economic growth. We are under the false impression that if urban activity grows that would transpose to the country’s economy surging. From a theoretical standpoint, this may stand true, however, from a pragmatic view this is false.
The issue is that in Pakistan, most of this urbanisation is unpremeditated, without following a plan or even obtaining permits. This “unplanned urbanisation” drastically lowers economic output along with having adverse effects on the daily lives of Pakistanis. This is most apparent in the bustling metropolis of Karachi. The city harbours an unofficial population of over 16 million earning it a spot on the populous cities in the world. Rough estimates have shown that Karachi has expanded over 50 times since independence in 1947. With drastic growth taking place, the city developed in an inadvertent manner.  Unplanned urbanisation negatively impacts the lives of Karachiites depriving them of basic facilities and resulting in lower economic productivity.
Unplanned urbanisation lessens the economic prosperity occurring in the city of Karachi. Karachi is the business capital of Pakistan and generates over half of the country’s GDP. With the remarkable opportunities available in the city, there is an influx of migrants from rural areas which in turn drives up the population — resulting in unplanned urbanisation.

Rough estimates have shown that Karachi has expanded over 50 times since independence in 1947

Another cardinal reason for this spontaneous growth is the incompetency of certain authorities along with land grabbing (corruption). One key example of how disorganised expansion has lowered the economy in the city can be found in the lack of public transport. Being a city with so much revenue, it is outlandish to think that Karachi doesn’t have a proper form of public transport. Before there was the Karachi Circular Railway, however, that fell into disarray after the emergence of land encroachments due to the unconstrained expansion of the city.
The void of public transport damages Karachi’s economy as people are forced to resort to using cars, motorcycles and scooters which results in increased expenses for an individual. Moreover, public transport stimulates economic growth as it provides jobs and increases mobility. In fact, an American Public Transportation Association research paper tells us that for every $1 invested in public transport, there is a return of $4. While this 400 per cent return might not be feasible in Karachi, this article still gives us an idea of the economic benefits public transport incurs. By not having public transport, Karachi is missing out on potential economic returns.
Moreover, unplanned urbanisation has resulted in electricity shortages. Load shedding is a common nuisance that every Karachiite is familiar with, however, apart from being a source of annoyance and inconvenience, it transposes in massive economic losses in the industrial sector. Industries that have a large electricity dependence such as Auto, Chemical, and Steel are some of the most affected. According to media reports, surveys conducted on an array of industries claim that load shedding on average results in a 30pc lower manufacturing yield.
A recent controversy in Karachi has been the demolishing of the Nasla Tower. The Supreme Court of Pakistan had issued an order for the demolition of The Nasla Tower. The general public needs to understand that Nasla Tower was a product of disorganised expansion and forced land acquisition.
The effects of the demolition of the tower are ubiquitous, halting the growing demand for apartments in the city of Karachi. The Builders Association has in fact issued a statement in which they are not constructing new towers due to a sharp decline in the number of bookings since the disputation. Investors and homebuyers alike have lost confidence in the builders fearing that their building may be hinged on dubious foundations.
In the 1960s, a grid plan was designed for Karachi by European civil engineers and city planners. A fraction of the plan was carried out before it was scrapped. Ever since then there has been no major public development schemes, resulting in a city based on spontaneous, haphazard, and disorderly growth.
Due to the city’s disorganised set-up, a plethora of problems has sprung up. One that has recently gained traction concerns air quality. In the winter season, Karachi frequently ranks in the top 10 worst cities in terms of air quality, with its air being dubbed “unhealthy”. Bad air quality can lead to shorter life spans, along with many respiratory problems, especially for asthmatic patients. This air quality index is caused by lax urban planning (or lack thereof) in which green spaces with trees aren’t commissioned.
Moreover, the city has expanded to the extent to which residential and industrial areas have intertwined, leading to industrial fumes polluting the city skies.
Housing over 16m people, it is unfathomable to believe that there is only one major artery that connects this city to the airport and beyond. There are no major plans that are being undertaken to ameliorate the dire situation. In Karachi, traffic accidents not only attribute to over 30,000 accidents a year but also stunt economic growth by decreasing mobility.
For a city that has expanded over 50 times in just 70 years, it was inevitable for it to experience spontaneous and rampant unorganised growth. Spontaneous urbanization is a problem that has long occurred in the city, however for the most part it remains unnoticed. It results in a tirade of problems that hinder the day-to-day lives of Karachiites. It also possesses many economic ramifications that cost the economy billions every year. If the misconception that urban growth transposes to economic success is abolished, the lives of many Karachiites will be better.  The local authorities along with the federal government must take the necessary steps to address this misconception otherwise this urban sprawl will give rise to an insurgency in order to curtail the unsustainable urban development.

12,Human development as a catalyst for progress,Expenditure on education must be enhanced to 2.5pc from 2pc of the GDP with greater efficiency in spending.,"Focusing on human development is considered to be an incredibly significant factor that not only accelerates economic growth but also promises a better quality of life for the public at large. Ensuring persistent and efficient spending on human development helps build up an educated and healthy workforce, increase productivity and growth, the benefits of which are equitably distributed. 
In order to determine the level of human development in a country, three main components — per capita income, level of education and the level of health — need to be gauged.
Unfortunately, Pakistan, a low-income nation, has been performing quite abysmally in these social indicators. Decades of inconsistent and incoherent economic policies adopted on the part of successive political setups have inevitably resulted in deteriorating quality of education, worsening health infrastructure and declining per-capita income.
According to the United Nations Human Development Index (HDI) 2020, Pakistan’s ranking stood at 154th among 189 countries, lower than all regional peers. Worryingly, the dismal performance of Pakistan in social indices indicates structural impediments grappling with the economic governance of the country.

The government expenditure on education must be enhanced to 2.5pc from 2pc of the GDP with greater efficiency in spending

Education has remained one of the highly neglected social services in Pakistan as the state has failed to ensure the effective provision of free and quality education equally accessible to all and sundry. About a third (20 million) of children in Pakistan are out of school, depriving them of an opportunity to become literate and productive members of society. As per Article 25A of the Constitution of Pakistan, all children of age five to 16 years must be provided free and compulsory education. This so far seems to be an elusive dream. 
Hafiz A. Pasha, in The Charter of the Economy, laid out policy recommendations that are indispensable to reform the educational system in Pakistan. One, 100 per cent net enrollment of boys and girls in primary, middle, and secondary education is imperative which will massively increase literacy. Two, instead of establishing new public universities, there is a greater need to emphasise recruiting highly qualified faculty staff that can impart education of high standards, in line with the ever-changing educational dynamics of the 21st century.
Three, since government expenditure on education, is 2pc of GDP, undermining its ability to ensure the development of critical infrastructure, it must be enhanced to 2.5pc with greater efficiency in spending. Not only this, effective governance — checking teacher absenteeism, ensuring availability of sufficient teaching materials, building school infrastructure— will also play an instrumental role in turning around the education sector in an unparalleled manner. Besides, the state should work out a plan to provide technical and vocational education to students in an attempt to equip them with market-demanded skills, expertise, and qualifications. 
There is no denying that the health system also confronts several challenges that have been compounded in the wake of Covid-19. It is increasingly observed that health crisis has become a potent threat to national progress, curtailing the potential of the country to emerge as a prosperous nation in a global village. 
Being a victim of the highest infant mortality rate in South Asia with the lowest life expectancy, Pakistan has been facing one of the worst health crises. What is worrisome is massively unequipped infrastructure: a) far too few hospital beds — six per 10,000 population; b) doctor to patient ratio — 1:1300; and c) declining population coverage by child centres, maternity, and dispensaries (PBS survey). 
In an attempt to improve the health sector, a national health policy needs to be effectively crafted and vigorously executed at the national, provincial, and local government levels. With the exponential growth of the population facing Pakistan, health facilities have to be increased. For that to be realised, provincial governments ought to augment their health sector allocation to at least 1.5pc of GDP, particularly development expenditure, as health is a provincial subject after the 18th amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan. 
While mobilising Lady Health Workers (LHWs) to ensure greater coverage of vaccinations is needed, it is equally important to encourage inculcating necessary education on family planning in women. Moreover, primary healthcare (PHC), a basic foundation of a health institution, has to be strengthened so that fundamental health services in the shape of treatment of health conditions, and minor health issues at a community level can be dealt with timely. In order to improve PHC, the incumbent government will have to devolve administrative and financial powers to the third-tier of government.
The daunting economic crisis invites the attention of a ruling cliché to carry out a robust agenda for economic reforms that can bring about a rise in economic growth, improve social indicators, do away with growing public discontent over skyrocketing inflation, soaring joblessness, and most alarming, decay of economic governance.

13,"Shrinking devolution, widening social  exclusion","Unlike in Pakistan, local govts have played a significant role in China’s sustained economic growth and poverty reduction.","The need for redefining the role of the state and the government for achieving sustainable and inclusive growth cannot be over-emphasised. 
One can witness the long lingering debate on two key issues in governance coming under the spotlight after the livelihood and health crisis triggered by pandemics. Firstly, will a big or small government deliver? Secondly, does the solution lie in return to a highly centralised system or wider dispersal of authority and responsibility?
Looking at the historical legacy, the centralisation at the cost of democracy and the corresponding command economy led to the collapse of the Soviet empire. In Pakistan, the mixed economy has left scores of sick state firms, currently surviving on taxpayers’ money. The denial of provincial autonomy led to the 1971 tragedy.
Yet even in free-market economies, governments have expanded over time with GDP growth resulting in a surge in inequality and authoritarianism. Britain former prime minister Margaret Thatcher and former US president Ronal Reagan did not leave a sustained legacy of small governments. And the governments’ spending particularly after the outbreak of pandemic as a ratio of GDP is going up in both countries.

The country is surrendering a bit of sovereignty every time it approaches lenders for more money

The view currently gaining ground is that the welfare state should be nimble and efficient. It should focus on redistributing cash and letting those in need choose what to do with it, and not set up new bureaucracies. Income support for households should be automated, where possible, as the financial sector becomes more digitalised. The aim should be to build societies that are fairer and more prosperous.
Projecting the above approach, analysts at London-based The Economist note that the state has particularly grown during the pandemic while its failures have been in full display.
“Instead of focusing on revenues, we need to rationalise (civil-military) expenditure,” says former State Bank Governor Shahid Kardar. The current expenditure of the federal government rose by 37.9 per cent in the first quarter of this fiscal year compared to the same period last year, according to the latest Economic Review of July-September released by the Ministry of Planning and Development. 
Simultaneously the centre was only able to contain the fiscal deficit at 0.9pc of the GDP owing to a provincial surplus of 0.4pc of the GDP, up from 0.1pc.
Owing to bad governance, the findings of the Auditor General of Pakistan show that irregularities incurred on Covid -19 operations were to the tune of Rs40 billion. Payments were made to ineligible people by all entities provided funds. The release of the audit report was one of the five prior actions that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had asked of Pakistan for the $1bn loan tranche in January.
The cash-strapped hybrid federal government, trapped in debt with shrinking policy choices cannot manage sustainable and inclusive economic development alone. Referring to IMF prior actions and the Saudi conditions attached to the dollar deposits lent to Pakistan, an analyst notes that the country is surrendering a bit of sovereignty every time it approaches lenders for more money. And this indicates that Pakistan’s excessive external indebtedness has deep structural roots.
Nor do foreign loans lead to inclusive growth. “Foreign aid is an excellent method for transferring money from poor people from rich countries to rich people in poor countries,” according to Hungarian born British development economist Peter Bauer. The Afghan economy and the government finances are in shambles despite billions of dollars poured into the country by the US for over two decades.
Devolving authority and responsibility to the grassroots level where local problems can be better identified and more effectively resolved is a must for reducing the widening social inclusion. It is also easier for local residents to access municipal bodies or community organisations for getting their problems resolved.
Unfortunately, devolution has stopped at the provincial level. The Sindh Local Government Amendment Bill 2021 passed by the provincial assembly on November 26 gives total control over municipal bodies to the provincial government, depriving them of whatever semblance of autonomy they enjoyed. The bill is in violation of Article 140-A of the Constitution, granting administrative, legislative and financial autonomy to the third tier of government.
Most of the key functions of the local bodies (LB), such as health and education, water supply and solid waste removal or enacting laws regarding food and drinks have been transferred to the provincial government.
Neither is the PTI’s performance encouraging. Despite its election pledge, it has yet to establish fully autonomous elected local bodies in Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Islamabad. However, the management of primary, elementary and secondary education facilities will come under the supervision of (to be) elected mayor of Islamabad, according to an ordinance promulgated by President Arif Alvi on November 22. The relevant federal ministry will supervise college and university education.
Punjab is reported to be planning to hold elections in March next year. No date has yet been fixed for Islamabad polls. The first phase of the polls in KP is due to begin on December 19. 
While upholding the Peshawar High Court judgement, a two-member bench of the Supreme Court headed by Umar Ata Bandial on November 30 turned down KP’s move to hold elections of the village and neighbourhood councils on a non-party basis. The court also did not accept KP’s advocate general’s plea to order the Election Commission of Pakistan to change the election schedule which, it noted, had already been delayed by two years.
Unlike in Pakistan, the local governments have played a significant role in China’s sustained economic growth and poverty reduction. They are currently stepping in to minimise the impact of the toxic debt stated to be threatening to ripple the property sector and small banks.
“To keep the building sites ticking,” says a foreign media report, “local governments are taking control of some unfinished projects. At smaller banks, many corporate shareholders are being forced out and replaced by local government’s asset managers.”
In the US, the federation gave funds to local governments to eradicate Covid-19. They initially imported foreign vaccines directly.

14,Data points,Billionaires through grammar,"Billionaires through grammar
Your teachers probably told you grammar is important — but did they mention it could make you a billionaire? A $200m investment round announced last week by popular grammar checking tool Grammarly didn’t just catapult the company’s value to $13bn, but minted billionaires out of two of its founders: Max Lytvyn and Alex Shevchenko. The Ukrainian-born entrepreneurs, who started the automated writing assistant in 2009 with the help of programmer Dmytro Lider, are now worth at least $4bn each thanks to the recent funding, Forbes estimates. About 22pc of Grammarly is owned by the investors involved in its two funding rounds in 2019 and 2021, according to data collected by Pitchbook. The San Francisco-based company was launched over a decade ago under the quickly abandoned name Sentenceworks as a subscription-based product aimed at helping students with their grammar and spelling. It has since evolved away from its sole focus on education and opened up access to its intelligence-driven grammar checker, which can be used to easily weed out the errors in emails, documents and more.

The benefit of communities
Decades of research shows that workplaces are often grounded in “ideal worker” norms that reward employees for overwork. People often internalise these demands, and as a means of striving for balance, constantly push themselves in both their work and home lives. Others maintain a willingness to commit to overwork during the week, so long as they can use the weekend as an attempt to recuperate. Adhering to these ideal 
worker norms can result in breakdowns of the body and mind. One way workers can break this vicious cycle of overwork and recuperation: join a community outside of work that taps into bodily awareness. Research on two groups of people taking yoga teacher training shows that learning how to “let go” during training also helped participants do the same in their work lives. Further, training with others provided a much-needed space beyond work and 
home to unpack and manage harmful work norms. The conclusion? To manage the damaging effects of “work hard, play hard” cultures, seek out communities beyond work and home.

Boosting entrepreneurship
Although governments employ different policies to boost entrepreneurial activities in a country, these initiatives would remain futile if they fail to inculcate entrepreneurial intentions among citizens. A study ‘Role of government initiatives in shaping entrepreneurial intentions: A canonical correlation analysis,’ highlighted that government initiatives are significantly related to perception about opportunities, capabilities and intention about entrepreneurship. The perception of capabilities and self-efficacy were the most important factors in gauging citizens’ perceptions about entrepreneurship. Similarly, government policies regarding taxes and bureaucracy, entrepreneurial education at the post-school stage, and physical infrastructure were the most important government interventions in shaping entrepreneurial perceptions among its citizens. Supportive institutions result in lower transaction costs and they play a pivotal role in the growth of new business startups.

Punishing the unvaccinated
In the battle against the coronavirus, the unvaccinated are being increasingly targeted. In Greece, the government is making vaccines mandatory for all Greeks above 60 years of age. From next month, refuseniks will pay a 100-euro ($113) fine every month they don’t get a shot, with the funds going to hospital services. Austria, with one of the lowest inoculation rates in Western Europe, will remain in lockdown until mid-December but a lockdown for the unvaccinated will probably persist, though they can still go to work with a negative test. Officials are also working on plans to impose mandatory vaccinations from February, with fines reaching as high as 7,200 euros ($8,151).
