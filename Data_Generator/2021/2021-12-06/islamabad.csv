The rainstarted in the wee hours and varying from drizzle tolightshowers continued with intervals. 
The meteorological department recorded two millimetres of rainat Zero Point and one mm at Golra and Rawalpindi. It also predicted morerain on Monday morning.
Due to the drop in the temperature to eight degrees Celsius, a very low pressure of natural gas was reported from most parts of the twin cities of Rawalpindi and people had to use alternative sources for heating and cooking purposes.
However, the rainwas welcomed by the citizens as the dry weather had created health problems.
The Met Office said a westerly wave was affecting upper parts of the country and likely to persist till Monday morning.
Cold and dry weather is expected on Monday. Smog/fog is likely to intensify in plain areas of Punjab during morning/night hours. Light rain (snowfall over hills) is expected in Gilgit-Baltistan, Kashmir and its surrounding hilly areas.

Gujar Khan, Chakwal and Jhelum also received light rain. Wheat growers in the Barani areas were losing hopes for a bumper harvest due to no rain since the sowing of the wheat crop.
Raja Sohail Janjua, a farmer in Daultala, said the dry spell affected the growth of the crop but even the light rain would promise a sufficient growth.
Another wheat grower in Gujar Khan, Chaudhry Rab Nawaz, said: “Being in the Barani area, growth of our crops is completely dependent on the timely rains.”
Dr Asif Chohan, a medical practitioner in Daultala, said the current spell of rain if continued for some days would have a soothing impact on people’s health.

2,Islamabad sees rise in Covid-19 weekly positivity rate,An official of the health ministry says the weekly positivity has increased by 0.3pc as it was 0.8pc last week.,"ISLAMABAD: With the arrival of winter, the weekly Covid-19 positivity ratio has started increasing which is being considered as an early warning for the whole country because during all four waves cases started increasing from the capital.
Meanwhile, four people were diagnosed with Covid-19 in Rawalpindi district on Sunday and the positivity ratio was recorded at 0.3 per cent during the last 24 hours. A total of 1,306 samples were collected and 1,302 of them were declared negative.
It may be noted that with the threat of the Omicron variant looming, more than 20pc of the population in the district is still not vaccinated; 38pc in the district is fully vaccinated while 50pc is partially vaccinated. The total population of Rawalpindi district is over 4.2 million and 2.1m people have received one dose of vaccination and 303,327 people are fully vaccinated.
On the other hand, not a single case of dengue fever was reported during the weekend.
An official of the Ministry of National Health Services, requesting not to be quoted, said the weekly positivity had increased by 0.3pc as it was 0.8pc last week and 0.58pc a week earlier.
“During the last week of November, a little over 27,000 tests were conducted of which 159 samples were found positive. However, during last week over 29,000 tests were conducted but 261 cases were found positive.”
The fact is that Islamabad has always remained a trendsetter for the whole country as every time cases started increasing from Islamabad and later the same situation reflected across the country.
“We fear that the cases may again start rising as positivity increases during the winter season,” he said.
District Health Officer Islamabad Dr Zaeem Zia while talking to Dawn agreed that the situation was not as good as it should be.
“We suggest the masses to get themselves vaccinated. All those who have not gotten their second dose in due date should walk to the nearest centre to get the second dose as vaccination is the best shield against the virus,” he said.
While replying to a question, Dr Zia said that healthcare workers and people over the age of 50 years should get booster dose of vaccine.
“Booster dose is being given to those who had gotten their second dose at least six months ago. Sinopharm, Sinovac and Cansino are available at all centres. Those who were vaccinated with Pfizer should go to the mass vaccination centres such as the one in F-9 Park,” he said.
Talking about dengue, he said the season seems to have ended in the city as not a single case was reported over the weekend. 
Rawalpindi
A senior official of the district administration told Dawn that the government launched the reach every door (RED) drive to vaccinate people from Oct 25 to Nov 12 and during the campaign, more than 1.1 million people were vaccinated. Moreover, five people were diagnosed with dengue fever on Sunday.
However, he said, the second dose will be administered to people in the second phase of the campaign, adding health authority teams were busy in the measles and rubella drive from Nov 15 to Nov 27. The authority has been asked to create awareness among people about vaccination.
When contacted, Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Ali said the administration was striving hard to vaccinate the entire population and in this regard, it has set the target to vaccinate 50,000 people on a daily basis.
He urged people to get vaccinated as soon as possible to avoid further spread of the deadly virus.

The event was organised by Devcom-Pakistan in collaboration with the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB), a subordinate organisation of the Ministry of Climate Change, Gym Club of Quaid-i-Azam University, CS Adventure Club of Comsats University, Westminster Academy and Rawalpindi Women University.
Before the walk and cleanup, IWMB Assistant Director Sakhawat Ali briefed the participants about biological diversity and natural heritage of Margalla Hills National Park (MHNP).
He said MHNP was established in 1980 and is the third largest national park in the world with an area of 17,386 hectares (42,960 acres) and is in the foothills of the Himalaya mountains. Tilla Charouni with a height of 1,604 metres is the tallest peak in the park. The park is rich in biodiversity, especially in Sino-Himalayan fauna, most notably gray goral, barking deer and the leopard. MHNP is home to around 600 plant species, 402 bird varieties, 38 mammals and 27 species of reptiles.
He said under the new management, recently the IWMB has taken steps for protection of the park and visitors. Many cases of woodcutting and forest fires were averted. The renovated IWMB Nature Education Centre is the hub of activities and awareness raising sessions.
Pakistan’s young rising face of hardcore mountaineering Sirbaz Khan and former deputy mayor of Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI) Zeshan Naqvi were also present. Well-known mountaineer Nazir Sabir was chief guest at the certificate distribution ceremony.
Speaking on the occasion, Mr Sabir said mountaineering had become very technical and challenging in the changing climate.
“Unpredictable harsh weather has made this an increasingly expensive sport. Many corporations are coming up globally to support their mountaineers except Pakistan. Many vibrant strategies are dusting in the public shelves. We need to get them out and launch them with a proactive action agenda to develop a team of skilful mountaineers and to mainstream Pakistan’s mountaineering facilities that have no match worldwide,” he said.
He said Prime Minister Imran Khan should form a task force of 8-10 leading mountaineers and people promoting Pakistan’s mountains to translate challenges into opportunities.
Mr Khan said unfortunately mountaineering was not on priority of the government while mountains were under threat from housing and timber mafia.
“We hardly see action against them. The government should opt for a strategy to promote and mainstream mountaineering and engage young enthusiasts,” he said.
Mr Nqvi said Islamabad has multiple places that can attract youth engagement and we can host youth and nature lovers from other cities and countries. 
The authorities should proactively pursue an action plan in this regard.
Devcom-Pakistan Executive Director Munir Ahmed said: “We encourage youth for outdoor pursuits. It is good for their mental and physical health besides making them a responsible visitor to nature.”

In a letter to the Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA), the provincial department enhanced the gestation period of the scheme titled ‘Feasibility Study and Detailed Design for Remodelling of Kutchery Chowk and Defence Chowk ’.
A senior RDA official toldDawnthat National Engineering Services Pakistan (Nespak) was carrying out the feasibility study and detailed design of two main squares to reduce traffic congestion in the area. He said the government had already allocated funds in its annual development programme.
The RDA prepared the PC-I for remodelling of Kutchery Chowk and Defence Chowk and sent it to Planning and Development Board for approval. The project cost of Kutchery Chowk was estimated to be Rs3.6 billion whereas Rs2.2 billion will be spent on the construction of Defence Chowk.
Meanwhile, RDA Chairman Tariq Mehmood Murtaza said that construction work on Ammar Chowk project would be completed by Dec 31.
Talking about the three mega projects in Rawalpindi being executed at Ammar Chowk, Kutchery Chowk and Defence Chowk, the RDA chairman said the decision to consecutively start these projects one after the other was taken keeping in view the traffic load and continuity of traffic flow on these roads.

9,Islamabad schoolteachers’ continue boycott of classes,The protesting teachers have decided to motivate parents to participate in the next sit-in outside the Parliament House.,"
Parents of students to be motivated to join next sit-in  
Teachers’ representative demands removal of Section 166 of LG Ordinance

ISLAMABAD: After holding two separate meetings with Education Minister Shafqat Mahmood and other officials of the education ministry, the teaching and non-teaching staff on Sunday announced that the boycott of classes would continue until the government revoked Section 166 of the Local Government Act.
The protesting teachers also decided to hold Parent-Teacher Association meetings in all schools on Monday to motivate parents to participate in the next sit-in outside the Parliament House, which according to teachers would be a decisive one. The protesters, however, have yet to finalise the date of the sit-in.
On the other hand, due to closure of all 390 schools of Islamabad, around 200,000 students have been out of school for the last one week due to the teachers’ strike. These students have already faced a huge loss of education during the last two years due to Covid-19 pandemic and frequent closures of schools.
“Prime Minster Imran Khan should look into this serious matter; all schools are closed in Islamabad while teachers are on the roads. The ultimate sufferers are students so it is the responsibility of the government to ensure opening of schools as soon as possible,” an official of the education ministry said on condition of anonymity.
Earlier, on Friday the action committee of teaching and non-teaching staff held a meeting with Education Minister Shafqat Mahmood to register their concerns over the Local Government Ordinance 2021, which stated that schools would come under the purview of the local government.
The protesting teachers said the education minister assured them that he would do whatever he could to remove the concerns of teachers on Section 166 of the LG ordinance.
After his meeting, the minister was hopeful that schools would be reopened on Monday as he also tweeted: “Met representatives of Islamabad Teachers to discuss the issue of placing FDE under the Mayor. Hopefully classes will resume by Monday.”
Sources said the teaching community also held a meeting with Joint Secretary Education Mohyuddin Ahmad Wani on Saturday. However, on Sunday, the teachers announced that they would not call off their strike until deletion of Section 166.
“We have decided that we will not call off our strike until the government removes Section 166 of the Local Government Ordinance. This is our one-point agenda and we will continue our struggle until the removal of this clause,” Schoolteachers Association President Malik Ameer Khan said.
Asked about meetings with the education ministry officials, Mr Khan said though the ministry offered that it would file a summary to request the federal government to amend Section 166, “we do not want any amendment rather Section 166 should be removed all together.”
He said this was a unanimous decision of all schoolteachers and non-teaching staff, adding the education ministry, instead of offering an amendment, should listen to the unanimous voice of teaching and non-teaching staff and move a summary for deletion of the section.
“If the ministry wants, it can do it in a single day,” he added.
On Nov 24, after the approval of the federal cabinet, President Dr Arif Alvi promulgated the Islamabad Local Government Ordinance 2021.
This ordinance, besides explaining other functions of the local government, says in Section 166 that the mayor would be the reporting officer of the director general of the Federal Directorate of Education (FDE).
The FDE regulates all 390 schools of the federal capital and under the ordinance the directorate would be devolved to the local government - a step which is not acceptable to teachers and non-teaching staff, who have been stating that it would be beyond the capacity of the mayor and local government to deal with the FDE as it required an annual budget of around Rs20 billion.
On the other hand, school education is free in Islamabad and the government also provides free books to students.
The protesting teachers fear that in order to meet its expenditure, the local government would ultimately start charging fee, end provision of free books and even privatise institutions. Therefore, schools should remain part of the education ministry, they added.
