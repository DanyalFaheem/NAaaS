The young attacking players struck goals early in the second half in San Sebastian to give Real their eighth consecutive win across all competitions and leave them eight points clear of nearest chasers Sevilla.
Real’s victory came after Atletico Madrid and Barcelona were upset at home, leaving them further adrift.
Atletico trailed by 10 points in fourth place after the defending champions were stunned by Mallorca 2-1 in the capital.
Barca were a whopping 16 points behind in seventh place following a 1-0 loss to Real Betis, their first defeat since Xavi Hernandez took over as coach.
Manuel Pellegrini’s Real Betis rose into third place, right behind crosstown rivals Sevilla, who beat Villarreal 1-0 thanks to a goal from Lucas Ocampos.
The 33-year-old Benzema was forced off in the first half at the Reale Arena with what appeared to be a problem around his left hamstring.
Yet Real marched on without their star striker.
Vinicius’ 12th goal of the season came in the 47th minute as he weaved in from the left and played a clever reverse pass into Jovic, who held the ball up and turned it back to Vinicius, who drove in.
Jovic has endured a torrid time since joining Madrid for 60 million euros in 2019 but he could be given a run now in Benzema’s absence. After teeing up Vinicius, he stooped low to head in Casemiro’s flick-on from a corner for his first goal of the season.
Barca had won twice and drawn once since Xavi replaced Ronald Koeman but those results had exposed their ongoing problems in front of goal and that was evident against Betis.
Ousmane Dembele, who come on off the bench, posed the greatest threat while the 19-year-old Abde Ezzalzouli missed a golden opportunity to equalise late on, when the ball was cut back to him eight yards out. The youngster blazed over.
In the 79th minute, Betis had showed more composure to finish off a scintillating counter-attack.
Sergio Canales broke free down the right but the move appeared to have lost its momentum when Canales pulled back to Cristian Tello on the edge of the area.
Instead, Tello shifted the ball quickly left to the arriving Juanmi Jiminez, who took one touch before sliding into the corner.
Atletico’s defeat by Mallorca was even more unexpected, given struggling Mallorca had not won a game since the start of October.
Atletico striker Matheus Cunha broke through for the defending champions in the 68th, only for Franco Russo to head Mallorca level in the 80th.
Atletico fell into the same trap that doomed Barca, pushing too many players forward in search of the winner. Takefusa Kubo struck Mallorca’s second goal in injury time after Angel Rodriguez launched him on a solo run from near the centre line with a pass behind Atltico’s defence.

1,Mr Gondal clinches December Cup,"Mr Gondal beat the 25 to 100 favourite colt The Great Shah, which was mauled by the winner by two lengths,...","Mr Gondal beat the 25 to 100 favourite colt The Great Shah, which was mauled by the winner by two lengths, impressively and was never challenged at any stage of the gruelling race in a magnificent display of speed, stamina and endurance.
LAHORE: Rank outsider bay colt Mr Gondal won the feature event, the December Cup, a term race of 1600m for three-year-old thoroughbreds, defeating a tiny field of three opponents to wear the rob of champion in a stunning performance here at the Racecourse on Sunday.
Filly Widad finished third, a length behind, while filly Hassan’s Heights completed the frame.
A prominent owner and Lahore Race Club (LRC) member Mahmood Khan gave away the cup to the winning owner flanked by the trainer  and rider Mazhar Ali to commemorate their victory at the prize distribution ceremony.
The supporting feature, the Malik Hamid Ali Noon Memorial Cup, a term race for two-year-old thoroughbred and half-bred colts and fillies contested over 1200 metres, went to bay colt Mr Perfect who beat favourite filly Nostalgia by  two lengths at the finish line. Bay filly Bortie and chestnut filly Queen completed the frame, respectively.
Twice beaten roan filly, Magical City, on her previous outings won the opener to give a victory boost to well-known trainer A.B. Malik to spur him into action.
Meanwhile female rider Alishba Mohsin, a new entrant in the racing field, is finding it difficult to continue riding because of the non-cooperative attitude of the male-dominated field of equine sports.
It was the third occasion on Sunday when Alishba was denied participation in races, although the owners had declared that she would ride their horse. However, the management replaced her with a male rider of less calibre.
She was to ride bay horse Jalpana Prince, but at the last moment was replaced with a novice rider Haroon Gulzar on some pretext who finished way behind the board. If such an inappropriate scenario continues at the racecourse, one fears the doors for Alishba and other female riders in all likelihood will be closed.

2,Lewandowski double as Bayern down Dortmund to go four points clear,BERLIN: Robert Lewandowski scored twice as Bayern Munich opened up a four-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga...,"BERLIN: Robert Lewandowski scored twice as Bayern Munich opened up a four-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga with a 3-2 win at second-placed Borussia Dortmund on Saturday.
Julian Brandt and Erling Haaland scored Dortmund’s goals at Signal Iduna Park, but Lewandowski netted and converted the winning penalty, either side of a Kingsley Coman goal.
Dortmund coach Marco Rose was shown a red card for arguing with the referee after a Mats Hummels handball led to Lewandowski converting the key spot-kick 12 minutes from time.
This was Bayern’s seventh straight win over Dortmund, including five Bundesliga victories and two German Super Cup triumphs.
Dortmund were unhappy to not be awarded a penalty after Marco Reus appeared to be fouled just before Lewandowski’s crucial spot kick.
We always had the feeling that we could win. That’s why it’s doubly bitter that we lost like that,” fumed Reus.
Dortmund forged ahead in the fifth minute when Brandt, who was later stretchered off after a clash of heads, slammed in a superb shot.
A Hummels mistake led to Lewandowski equalising four minutes later against his former club when the Poland striker motored onto a Thomas Mueller pass and fired home.
Bayern capitalised on another Dortmund error when Coman’s excellent strike put the visitors in front before half-time.
Just 120 seconds after the break, Dortmund were level when Haaland shot past diving Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer after Dayot Upamecano cheaply gave away possession.
Dortmund were unlucky not to be awarded a penalty when their Reus appeared to be fouled by Lucas Hernandez.
At the other end, Hummels was again at fault when VAR confirmed his handball, to Rose’s fury, and Lewandowski made no mistake.
I think we deserved to win but I also understand the discussions over the two penalty situations,” Bayern coach Julian Nagelsmann said.
Bayern, chasing a record-extending 10th league crown, move up to 34 points, leaving Dortmund in second place on 30.
The onset of winter brought a flurry of goals on Saturday, when Patrick Schick scored four to help Bayer Leverkusen consolidate third place on 27 points with a 7-1 rout of helpless Greuther Fuerth.
Schick needed only 27 second-half minutes for his four-goal haul, the league’s fastest since Lewandowski scored five in nine minutes against VfL Wolfsburg in September 2015.
Fuerth extended their desolate Bundesliga-record run of defeats to 12 straight, while the promoted team’s solitary point is also a record after 14 rounds.
Hoffenheim climbed into the top four with a 3-2 home win over Eintracht Frankfurt, whose three-match winning streak was ended. Bochum won in Augsburg 3-2, Mainz 05 dispatched visiting Wolfsburg 3-0, and Arminia Bielefeld fought back against visiting Cologne to draw 1-1.

3,"Milan move top, Inter see off Mourinho’s Roma",MILAN: A much-changed AC Milan saw off bottom side Salernitana 2-0 on Saturday to take top spot in Serie A as...,"MILAN: A much-changed AC Milan saw off bottom side Salernitana 2-0 on Saturday to take top spot in Serie A as previous leaders Napoli lost 3-2 to Atalanta, while Inter Milan cruised to victory at AS Roma.
Milan coach Stefano Pioli made six changes to his starting XI from the midweek victory at Genoa, with Tuesday’s crucial Champions League match against Liverpool in mind.
But Franck Kessie and Alexis Saelemaekers both scored inside the first 20 minutes to ensure a straightforward victory for the hosts at the San Siro.
Kessie fired home after Rafael Leao cut the ball back from the byline in the fifth minute and Saelemaekers doubled Milan’s lead in the 18th with a powerful strike.
Milan have given their bid for a first league title since 2011 a boost this week after bouncing back from two straight defeats with successive victories.
Pioli’s men sit one point clear of reigning champions Inter, who beat Roma 3-0, and two ahead of Napoli.
I am satisfied with a good performance, a decent victory, because some assumed this could be taken for granted,” Pioli told DAZN. It would’ve been better if we had scored more goals, especially considering how many chances we created.” 
The seven-time European champions have to beat already-qualified Liverpool in their final group game in Milan next week to have a chance of reaching the last 16.
Roma coach Jose Mourinho had a nightmare match against his former team as the capital side, missing several players through injuries and suspension, were brushed aside by Inter.
Hakan Calhanoglu, former Roma forward Edin Dzeko, and Denzel Dumfries scored in the first half. It was the first time in Mourinho’s career that one of his teams was 3-0 down at halftime.
Mourinho answered only one question from journalists in his news conference.
“I apologise again for not responding to other questions. Im just going to say what I think,” Mourinho said. “Inter is better than us on a good day, they finished with 29 points more than us last year and also this year they’re better. On a good day it would have been a difficult match, but today it was even harder because of absentees.”
Mourinho steered Inter to the treble of Serie A, Italian Cup and Champions League success in 2010. He took over at Roma in the offseason but has had mixed results. Roma have lost four of their past six league matches.
Inter opened the scoring when Calhanoglu curled in directly from the corner flag. The lead was doubled in the 24th minute. Calhanoglu cut inside from the left and pulled the ball back for Dzeko to sweep into the top left corner.
The Nerazzurri had the result virtually wrapped up by halftime. Alessandro Bastoni whipped in a cross from the left for a diving header from Dumfries at the back post.
Two goals in the space of five minutes saw Atalanta recover from 2-1 down to win in Naples.
Ruslan Malinovskyi opened the scoring for Napoli before Piotr Zielinski equalised. Dries Mertens extended the lead at the Diego Maradona Stadium before Atalanta roared back with goals from Merih Demiral and Remo Freuler to seal a dramatic win.

The Dutch midfielder jumped higher than his marker in added time to head home a pinpoint cross from Kylian Mbappe two minutes into stoppage time to cancel out Seko Fofana’s second-half opener and put PSG on 42 points from 17 games.
Mauricio Pochettino’s side, who once again looked severely short of ideas, lead second-placed Olympique de Marseille by 13 points after OM slumped to a 2-1 defeat at home against Stade Brestois earlier on Saturday.
Lens, who missed several chances to wrap it up before Wijnaldum’s equaliser, stayed fifth on 27 points.
PSG coach Mauricio Pochettino’s substitutions proved decisive as Mbappe and Wijnaldum came in for the last 20 minutes.
In front of a buoyant crowd at Stade Felix Bollaert, Lens played with pace and flair but missed a cutting edge until Fofana broke the stalemate in the 62nd minute.
PSG looked disorganised most of the time. Lionel Messi, who was awarded a record-extending seventh Ballon d’Or this week, hit the woodwork in the first half and could not add to his meagre tally of one goal in the league since he joined this summer.
Lens took the lead while Messi was lying on the pitch following contact with Facundo Medina. Fofana unleashed a powerful long-range strike that Keylor Navas failed to block.
Despite two consecutive draws, PSG increased its lead to 13 points after Marseille lost at home against Brest.
Brazilian international Gerson opened the scoring in the first half for Marseille with his second goal in as many games after playing a one-two with Dimitri Payet.
However, Brest levelled early in the second half as Romain Faivre scored a penalty after a Boubacar Kamara handball.
Franck Honorat then crashed a superb winner in off the underside of the crossbar as the Brittany side made it six successive league wins, the best run in their history in the top flight lifting them to sixth.
A late Jimmy Giraudon own goal allowed reigning champions Lille to beat Troyes 2-1 and rise to seventh.
Before that the league’s leading scorer Jonathan David equalised with his 11th goal of the season after Troyes had gone in front.

Just 6.2 overs from a possible 98 were possible as Pakistan resumed the day on 161-2 and reached 188-2 before the umpires called it a day.
Skipper Babar Azam was batting on 71 with Azhar Ali on 52 at stumps.
Rain and bad light also interrupted the game on day one, allowing just two sessions.
As the game started after the lunch session on Sunday, Babar resumed with a boundary through fine leg off pacer Khaled Ahmed, showing his intention to score quick runs.
Right-handed Azhar also hit a boundary in the second ball he faced off pacer Ebadot Hossain.
He then struck two consecutive fours in Ebadot’s next over to reach his 34th Test fifty off 126 balls just before rain forced the postponement.

10,Rangnick starts United reign with win as Spurs stroll,LONDON: Manchester United started the Ralf Rangnick era with a 1-0 win against Crystal Palace on Sunday as Tottenham...,"LONDON: Manchester United started the Ralf Rangnick era with a 1-0 win against Crystal Palace on Sunday as Tottenham Hotspur crushed Norwich City 3-0 to extend their recent revival under Antonio Conte. 
Rangnick, taking the reins for the first time, named an unchanged side at Old Trafford after United beat Arsenal 3-2 in midweek and was rewarded with a high-energy performance in the first half, backed by a vocal crowd. 
Cristiano Ronaldo had the hosts’ best chances as Palace initially struggled to get a foothold but the game remained goalless at half-time. 
United’s performance levels dipped in the second period and Rangnick threw on Mason Greenwood and Anthony Elanga for Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford to inject fresh energy into his attack. 
But it was often-maligned Brazil midfielder Fred who broke the deadlock, curling home a superb strike past Palace goalkeeper Vicente Guaita from outside the box after a pass from Greenwood. 
The three points lifts United to sixth place in the table, three points behind fourth-placed West Ham United. 
Spurs are one point ahead of United with a game in hand after cruising to a 3-0 win against bottom side Norwich — their third straight victory in the Premier League. 
Lucas Moura opened the scoring in the 10th minute. After a nice piece of skill to round a Norwich defender, he played a one-two with Son Heung-min, turned his marker and thundered an unstoppable drive into the top corner from 20 yards. 
Tottenham doubled their lead midway through the second half when Davinson Sanchez smashed home a loose ball from a corner. 
Son made it 3-0 in the 77th minute with a fine goal as Ben Davies and Oliver Skipp combined before the South Korean fired into the bottom corner. 
Also on Sunday, Leeds United struck late to draw 2-2 with Brentford at Elland Road — Patrick Bamford scoring deep into stoppage time to rescue a point for his side.
Tyler Roberts gave Leeds a 27th-minute lead, sliding on to Raphinha’s cross from the left to stab the ball home. 
Shandon Baptiste equalised for Brentford from the edge of the penalty area in the 54th minute and Sergi Canos put the Londoners ahead seven minutes later. 
But Bamford had the last word, poking home from close range in the 95th minute following a corner. 
CITY GO TOP
On Saturday, Chelsea paid a heavy price for a 3-2 defeat at West Ham United as first Liverpool, then Manchester City, leapfrogged them in the Premier League title race, with Pep Guardiola’s team ending the day on top for the first time this season.
Thomas Tuchel’s Chelsea began the day with a narrow lead and twice went in front at the London Stadium, only to be stunned by a late goal from substitute defender Arthur Masuaku. 
It looked as though Liverpool had let Chelsea off the hook as their later clash at Wolverhampton Wanderers went into stoppage time still goalless.  
But Divock Origi, making his 100th appearance as a Liverpool substitute, latched on to a Mohamed Salah pass to smash a winner past Wolves keeper Jose Sa in the 94th minute.  
In the day’s late kickoff, Manchester City outclassed Watford in a 3-1 victory at Vicarage Road with Raheem Sterling paving the way before Bernardo Silva struck twice.
And if the defending champions keep playing like this, it could be difficult to knock City off their perch even in a tight title race.  
City displayed total dominance at Watford, showing off the kind of fluid passing game that helped Guardiola’s team win three of the last four league titles and proving once again that they can do perfectly fine without a recognised striker in the lineup.  
It was a fifth straight league win for City, who are one point ahead of Liverpool and two in front of Chelsea after 15 rounds.  
“It’s always better to be top of the league than second, third or fourth, but it’s still early,” Silva said.  
Elsewhere, Newcastle United won for the first time in the league after Callum Wilson’s goal earned them a 1-0 victory against fellow relegation battlers Burnley to clamber off the bottom of the table and give new manager Eddie Howe hope they can survive.  
Brighton & Hove Albion drew for the eighth time this season as Neal Maupay scored in the 98th minute to rescue a point in a 1-1 draw at Southampton.

11,Shakib Al Hasan asks  to skip New Zealand Tests,"Local media reported that Shakib’s letter asked to withdraw for  “family reasons”, without giving further details.","DHAKA: Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan has sought to withdraw his name from the squad for next month’s Test series in New Zealand, selectors said Sunday.
Bangladesh, who will play two Tests against New Zealand in January, earlier included Shakib’s name in the squad for the series.
“He gave a letter to the chief executive officer seeking leave. We are yet to be informed if his application has been granted or not,” Chief selector Minhajul Abedin said, referring to the Bangladesh Cricket Board.
Local media reported that Shakib’s letter asked to withdraw for  “family reasons”, without giving further details.
The cricketer returned to the Bangladesh squad for the ongoing second Test against Pakistan in Dhaka after injury forced him to sit out their earlier match in Chittagong.
He missed four of Bangladesh’s seven Tests this year — two to injury and two to prior commitments with the Indian Premier League.
Bangladesh’s team will leave home for New Zealand at the end of Dhaka Tests.
The first Test against New Zealand will be held at Tauranga from January 1-5. Christchurch will host the second Test from January 9-13.

12,Ravichandran Ashwin puts India on brink of series triumph over New Zealand,Hosts were five wickets away from a 1-0 series victory with New Zealand reaching 140 for five at close of play on day three.,"

MUMBAI: New Zealand batter Daryl Mitchell drives during the second Test against India at the Wankhede Stadium on Sunday.—AFP

 
MUMBAI: India off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin struck three early blows to put the hosts on course for a series-clinching victory against New Zealand in the second and final Test at the Wankhede Stadium on Sunday.
The hosts were five wickets away from a 1-0 series victory with New Zealand reaching 140 for five at close of play on day three, chasing an improbable target of 540 and with two days still remaining.
It was a much better showing with the bat from the world Test champions who managed only 62 in their first innings in reply to India’s 325 on a pitch offering plenty of assistance to the spin bowlers.
Ashwin, third on the list of most successful Indian Test bowlers with 426 scalps, dismissed stand-in captain Tom Latham lbw before the players left the field early for the tea interval due to a technical problem with the Spidercam. 
The wily 35-year-old returned to send back Will Young and Ross Taylor in the and reduce New Zealand to 55 for three. 
Daryl Mitchell and Henry Nicholls shared a stand of 73 before left-arm spinner Axar Patel dismissed the former for an attacking 60. 
The touring side’s problems were compounded when Tom Blundell had a brain fade moment and was run out without scoring. Nicholls survived nervous moments but remained unbeaten on 36 with Rachin Ravindra on two not out. 
“Obviously, it’s a very, very long road ahead but hopefully we can build some partnerships and play ourselves in,” Ravindra said. “Two of them [Mitchell and Nicholls] showed us how to get it done and we will hope to build on it.” 
Earlier, the hosts declared on 276 for seven, ensuring their bowlers had enough time to dismiss New Zealand after the opening Test in Kanpur ended in a thrilling draw. 
A day after becoming only the third bowler to pick up all 10 wickets in a Test innings, the Mumbai-born Ajaz Patel picked up four more to take his match tally to 14. 
Left-arm spinner Ajaz finally received support from his slow bowling colleagues with part-time left-armer Rachin Ravindra picking up 3-56. 
The New Zealand fast bowlers again failed to pick up a wicket but stopped the Indian batters from scoring freely with a tight line from around the wicket. 
Resuming on 69-0, India openers Mayank Agarwal and Cheteshwar Pujara extended their partnership to 107 before Ajaz sent the former back. 
Agarwal was out caught for a confident 62 to add to his first-innings score of 150. Pujara also looked set for a half-century but was out caught in the slips for 47. 
Regular opener Shubman Gill, who did not bat in his usual position after suffering a blow to his elbow while fielding, also missed out on a half-century by getting out on 47 as did India captain Virat Kohli who made 36. All-rounder Axar provided fireworks during his unbeaten 41, with four sixes and three fours in his 26-ball innings.

13,PM to inaugurate Kamyab Jawan Sports Drive today,ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan will inaugurate the Kamyab Jawan Sports Drive here at Pakistan Sports Complex ...,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan will inaugurate the Kamyab Jawan Sports Drive here at Pakistan Sports Complex on Monday, which will see 6000 aspiring athletes take part. 
A news release issued by the Prime Minister Office stated that the country’s “first-ever mega sports event” will conclude on Dec 9 with 3300 boys and 2700 girls of various universities from across the countries competing. 
At a news conference here at the Pakistan Sports Complex, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Chaudhry Fawad Hussain said that sports could help the country’s youth utilise their potential in constructive and healthy way. 
“The participation of athletes between the ages of 15-25 is highly positive,” said Fawad, sitting alongside Federal Minister for Inter Provincial Coordination Dr. Fehmida Mirza and Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Youth Affairs Usman Dar. “Sports had been on the decline, as the economy was declining, but now things are improving.” 
Dr Fehmida added that the whole of next year would be celebrated as a sports year while Usman said that the event will provide a platform for the youth which does not have access to sporting infrastructure. 
“The Government of Sindh should also extend support to Kamyab Jawan Program,” he added. 
In a news release, the Higher Education Commissions said that events will be held in fifteen different disciplines including athletics, hockey, football, squash, boxing, judo, tennis, handball and volleyball. 
All events will be held at Jinnah Stadium as well as different gymnasiums and other venues of Islamabad and Rawalpindi. 
Pakistan Sports Board director general retired Col Asif Zaman told Dawn that after the event, “talented players would be provided more opportunities to excel at national and international levels.” 
OWEN-LED VENTURE TEAMS UP 
Also on Sunday, a news release issued by Global Soccer Ventures — which is aiming to launch a franchise football league in the country — announced a partnership with the Kamyab Jawan Sports Drive. 
Usman said at the news conference that with former England striker Michael Owen being the brand ambassador of GSV, this partnership will help take Pakistan’s football talent to the international level. 
GSV said that it will bring the prime minister’s vision to “mobilise the youth into football with an international professional football gateway” to life with a “nationwide grass-root talent hunt programme in Pakistan conducted under a UEFA-licensed coaching team from Europe” from next month. 
“The much-anticipated iconic stadium and GSV’s flagship soccer city will be unveiled soon integrated with sports science,” it added. “GSV’s strategic intent is to work with the heartbeat of youth and working hand-inglove with the educational institutes, forging a strategic alliance with the Kamyab Jawan.”

14,Kieron Pollard ruled out of WI tour of Pakistan,West Indies will play three T20s and three 50-over matches at Karachi’s National Stadium starting on Dec 13.,"ST. JOHN’S: West Indies’ white-ball captain Kieron Pollard withdrew on Sunday from the upcoming tour of Pakistan after failing to recover from the hamstring injury he sustained in the Twenty20 World Cup. 
West Indies will play three T20s and three 50-over matches at Karachi’s National Stadium starting on Dec 13 in what will be the first visit by an international side since England and New Zealand pulled out of scheduled tours this year for security reasons. 
“Pollard will undergo rehabilitation work in Trinidad ... and will be reassessed in a few weeks ahead of the upcoming home tours against Ireland and England in January 2022,” Cricket West Indies said in a statement on Sunday. 
Cricket West Indies said Nicholas Pooran will lead the T20I side — he also captained them in the 4-1 win over Australia in St Lucia earlier this year — with all-rounder Rovman Powell replacing Pollard as a player. 
Shai Hope will captain the one-day international team for the first time with the experienced Devon Thomas coming into the squad. 
West Indies, who failed to reach the T20 World Cup semi-finals, have picked several uncapped players in two 15-man squads for the tour of Pakistan. 
The ODI series will be West Indies’ fourth of 12 in the men’s Cricket World Cup Super League in which the top seven teams can secure automatic qualification for the 2023 World Cup in India. 
West Indies currently lie in eighth position out of 13 teams and have the opportunity to move above Pakistan into seventh position.

15,Travis Head gets the nod as Australia confirm XI for first Ashes Test,England captain Joe Root is less forthcoming about England’s lineup.,"BRISBANE: New Australia captain Pat Cummins has confirmed batsman Travis Head and fast bowler Mitchell Starc will play in the first Ashes Test.
Cummins said that Head is set to be picked ahead of Usman Khawaja in this week’s first Ashes Test at the Gabba, while the early call on left-arm quick Mitchell Starc, as a new ball bowler, means the hosts have now settled on a line-up well ahead of Wednesday’s toss.
“It was a tight one, the selectors make the call, but both are really good options, with really strong form,” said Cummins at a pre-Series media event with both team captains on Sunday.
Head was dropped after the Boxing Day Test against India last year, and Cummins said the way he has responded gave him a narrow edge over the veteran Khawaja.
“Experience is great from Uzzie [Khawaja] and were really lucky to have that in the squad. But Travis been playing a lot for us the last couple of years, and he’s gone away and churned out runs over in England and here in Australia and we feel like he’s really ready to go.”
Cummins said he was leaning towards allowing Starc — who held his place in Australia’s bowling quartet ahead of Jhye Richardson and Michael Neser — to join Josh Hazelwood as the new ball pairing in Brisbane.
“No [I haven’t decided] is the honest answer; I probably wont [open] first-up, but we’ve been quite fluid in recent years, pending the situation,” Cummins said. “Maybe [I will if it’s] late in the day and with only a couple of overs to bowl and I feel I want to have a crack.
“Starcy’s great .. we knew we had three weeks building up and he’s been building up nicely, he was fast [in training on Saturday], swinging the ball big,” Cummins said.
England captain Joe Root was less forthcoming about England’s lineup.
Root admitted he is yet to settle on his side and whether he would select an all-out pace attack at the pace-friendly Gabba and leave out spinner Jack Leach.
We’ve got all the options on the table just now and we’re not going to name the team just yet,” Root said.
We can spend hours and hours talking about Australia but ultimately we have to prepare ourselves as best we can and look after our own thing and make sure with the preparation we’ve had we get the most out of the next few days.”
Root will be looking to become the first captain to lead England to victory in Australia since Mike Gatting in 1986-87.
The Yorkshireman’s side shared a 2-2 draw with the Australians in England two-and-a-half years ago and Root is hoping to go one better this time around.
If you look at how hard it has been for English captains and English teams over the years, [winning in Australia] is something that doesn’t happen very often, so of course it will define my captaincy,” he said.
I’m not naive enough to think that it won’t. But it’s a great opportunity. I’m very excited about it and can’t wait for the series to get going.”
Preparations for both teams have been affected by the ongoing pandemic, but Root is confident his team will be ready when the first ball is bowled.
We’ve planned extremely well for this series, we’ve given ourselves the best chance in many ways and we’ve made the most of the little preparations that we have had until now,” he said. It’s important we can continue that over the next couple of days.”
