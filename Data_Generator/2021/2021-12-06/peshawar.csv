0,Free liver transplant facility in KP only for poor patients,Govt has allocated Rs1bn under SHPI; contracts finalised with two private hospitals in Lahore and Islamabad.,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has decided to provide free liver transplant facility only to ‘selected poor patients’ under the Social Health Protection Initiative, according to official sources.
Unlike the other diseases, which are being covered free of cost under SHPI, the government has decided that cashless liver transplant would be provided only to the poor people, who couldn’t afford the expenses.
SHPI has already finalised contracts with two private hospitals, one each in Lahore and Islamabad, for free liver transplant of the residents of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa but owing to the high charges, it has been decided to entertain only poor patients.
The charges of a single liver transplant at the two hospitals are around Rs5 million, which can eat up the entire budget of Rs1 billion allocated for the purpose. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has allocated Rs21 billion for the programme for the year 2021-22 that include Rs1 billion only for free liver transplant.

Dr Mohammad Riaz Tanoli, the chief executive officer of SHPI, told Dawn that they wanted to provide free medical services to poor people. “We will put in place a mechanism on the pattern of Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre to judge the financial status of the people wanting to undergo liver transplant,” he added.
He said that government had been providing cashless treatment services to the people regardless of the financial status for other ailments. He added government wanted to facilitate 200 patients in one year by spending the amount already set aside for liver transplant.
Dr Riaz said that government also wanted the patients to pay for their pre-transplant screening to reduce burden on the programme. “Not only liver transplant surgery but the patients would also require post-transplant treatment for six months the cost of which would be paid by SHPI. We want to reduce the chances of rejection of transplant, therefore, the post-transplant expenses would be paid by the government,” he added.
He said that their teams would interview the families besides conducting other investigations to ensure that the patients belonged to poor background and couldn’t afford the charges of liver transplant.
He said that they had treated 500,000 patients since the extension of the programme to the entire population in November last year. A total of Rs10 billion had been spent on the free treatment of patients in the province.
“We are waiting for go-ahead by Health Minister Taimur Khan Jhagra, who is supervising the cashless treatment programme. The liver transplants would start from January next year,” he said.
Dr Riaz said that given the popularity of SHPI, the people were busy to correct their credentials in Nadra to be able to avail free health services at government and private hospitals.
He said that last year, the number of registered families in the province was 7.2 million that was increased to 7.6 million because government provided treatment to patients on Nadra’s record. “Every three months, we are updating record with Nadra due to which the quantum of complaints has also been reduced by 60 per cent. There are 524 empanelled hospitals countrywide including 166 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” he added.
The programme was started to cover three per cent population in four selected districts of the province with the financial support of KfW bank of Germany in 2015. It was extended to 51 per cent population of the province in 2016 and then to 69 per cent in 2017 and to the entire population of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2020.
Overall, about Rs18 billion has been spent on the treatment of 730,000 patients. Each family is entitled to avail up to Rs1 million free treatment services at the designated hospitals.

5,Porters reeling under strict restrictions at Torkham border,Workers ask authorities to devise a convenient mechanism for their cross-border movement.,"KHYBER: Mussawir Khan, 15, twice had his dreams shattered, first when he abandoned his education a year ago to take up the laborious job of a porter at Torkham border in order to augment his family’s meagre earnings and then when the border authorities restricted his frequent cross-border movement by making acquisition of visa mandatory for thousands of daily wagers and porters like him.
He said that his daily earnings dropped considerably from Rs1,200 to a mere Rs200 or Rs300 per day after restriction on movement of daily wagers and porters due to imposition of coronavirus SOPs and condition of visa.

Workers ask authorities to devise a convenient mechanism for their cross-border movement

Mussawir Khan and his father, a health worker affiliated with polio vaccination, jointly look after their family of 10, though with much difficulties with their hard-earned meager resources.
Tilawat Khan, 54, another daily wager working at Torkham border for nearly 35 years, pointed his anger at National Logistic Cell (NLC) staffers, accusing them of not allowing them to freely move across the border without legal travel documents. He also has one of his arms handicapped.
He said that nobody else, neither the Afghan border officials nor the Pakistani immigration staff or the security forces, had questioned their credentials except for NLC. “The NLC staffers not only hamper our movement but also use force to stop us from carrying out our daily labour in the name of travel documents,” he alleged.
“Life has also become very difficult for us after the recent hike in prices of daily use items, which also coincided with loss of our jobs due to restrictions on our movement on both sides of the border,” Tilawat Khan, a father of nine, told this scribe in a grim voice.
Pakistan closed its borders with Iran and Afghanistan on May 8 for pedestrians to prevent transmission of coronavirus into the country. However, bilateral trade with these neighboring countries continued, though with health-related restrictions.
Torkham border was later reopened for pedestrian movement on October 21 after a drop in coronavirus cases but restrictions on nearly 8,000 labourers remained intact as they were asked to acquire legal travel documents for their day-to-day cross-border movement.
Most of these daily wagers and porters belong to the nearby villages and towns. The residents of these localities have been running their small time businesses and carrying out different menial jobs as they have no other sources of income.
Pakistan and Afghanistan had up till recent past informally exempted residents on both sides of the border from visa or any other travel documents while these people capitalised only on the national identity cards of their respective countries and temporary tokens issued to them by National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) for moving on both sides of Torkham, a fact acknowledged even by the security and immigration officials at the border.
Officials said that the facility to freely move across the border was informally extended to local tribes under the internationally recognised ‘easement rights policy’ which allowed people residing near the border to cross the border on multiple occasions and stay within a certain distance of the border rather than going deep into any side of the border.
Zakir Umar, a spokesman for the labourers, told this scribe that he had never witnessed such a worse situation for daily wagers and porters during his 25 years of association with part time cross-border occupation.
He said that for the past few decades, CNIC, Afghan Tazkira and Nadra tokens were a sure ‘passport’ for frequent cross-border mobility for thousands of local and Afghan labourers. “Not only we have personal occupations on both sides of the border, but also have family relations on both sides and thus imposing visa restriction on these people is unjustified and against basic human rights,” he added.
Mr Umar demanded of the ministry of interior, corps commander Peshawar and officials of the local administration to devise a convenient mechanism for restoration of their cross-border movement and revival of the much sought after menial jobs in order to augment their daily meagre earnings.

Kalash women at a bashaleni. — Dawn

 
CHITRAL: A local support organisation working in Kalash valleys has expressed its satisfaction over the improvement of bashalenis (maternity homes), saying it is leading to reduction in mortality rate among women and newborns. 
Ayun and Valleys Development Programme (AVDP) held a meeting here the other day to discuss the health and hygiene in the Kalash valleys. The programme chairman Rahmat Elahi presided over the meeting, which was attended by its members. 
It was noted that bashalenis in the valleys had been converted into safe places for the women where they passed their menstruation and pregnancy days. 
It was stated that in Kalash society the bashaleni played an important role in the lives of womenfolk who passed five to seven days in a month and 65 to 90 days in a year there as their stay in homes during the menstruation and maternity days was strictly a taboo. 
They appreciated the role of Aga Khan Rural Support Programme for launching its project by which the seven bashalenis (maternity homes) in all the three valleyswere revamped and refurbished with relevant facilities while giving special attention to hygiene. 
In a specially prepared report read out on the occasion about the condition of bashalenis, itwas stated that the bashaleni of Krakal, Batrik, Broon and Anizh villages in Bumburate, Groom village bashaleni in Rumbur and that of Guru and Bishar villages in Birir valley were provided with furniture, crockery, birthing space and hygiene kits apart from endowment funds to carry out the activities by the community members. 
The report said that earlier hygiene conditions in these facilities were very poor which would cause diseases among the women, while they would face problems during pregnancy days. 
It said that trained birth attendants, medicines and delivery kits had been provided in each bashaleni coupled with other facilities for safe delivery. 
It said that all this was now playing a pivotal role in reducing mortality rate among Kalasha mother and newborns. 
Rahmat Elahi said that strengthening of the institution of bashaleni in the Kalash society was getting due priority by AVDP.
