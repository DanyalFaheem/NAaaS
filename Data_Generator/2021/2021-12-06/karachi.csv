0,"Education, tolerance stressed on Sindh Culture Day","Politicians, mostly nationalist leaders, joined the Sindh Culture Day celebrations in Karachi apart from civil society members.","KARACHI: Like other parts of the province, ‘Sindh Culture Day’ was observed in Karachi on Sunday with this year’s slogan of Ilm Pirayo, Sindh Sanwaro (promote education, foster Sindh).
People wearing traditional Sindhi dresses took out rallies in different parts of the metropolis.
The main event took place outside the Karachi Press Club (Deen Muhammad Wafai Road-Corner Fawara Chowk), which was organised by different Sindhi TV channels.
A police officer said that elaborate security arrangements were made and law enforcers were closely monitoring the events to maintain law and order as estimated 5,000-6,000 people were participating in events in the evening.
Thousands of people mostly youths including women and children sang and danced when famous singers Ahmed Mughal, Tufail Sanjrani, Taj Mastani, Shehla Gul and others demonstrated their performance, singing songs depicting longing for Sindh.
Politicians, mostly nationalist leaders, also joined the celebrations apart from civil society members.
Qaumi Awami Tehreek chief Ayaz Latif Palijo on this occasion said that singing, dancing and wearing traditional Sindhi dresses were good thing, but it was more important to remember as to why great civilisations like Greece, Romans, Egyptians shrunk and as to why Red Indians in America and Aborigines in Australia vanished.
“These civilisations and the communities were eclipsed as they did not change themselves as changing time and did not seek knowledge, technology and science,” observed Mr Palijo.
Referring to the recent tragic incident in Sialkot, he said the lynching of a Sri Lankan man by a mob over allegation of blasphemy had presented a danger to all and urged the people “to put a wall against this extremism”.
“We, Muslims are in majority, but Islam does not allow force and compulsion in the religion and it talks about respect for others’ religions as well,” he added.
Citing recent gruesome murders in certain parts of Sindh allegedly at the behest of influential persons like Nazim Jokhio on the outskirts of Karachi, the QAT head said these killings took place because of Jirga system and Wadera Shahi (feudalism).“We have to promote education to fight against feudalism, Jirgas and tribalism,” he said.
Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz chief Sanan Qureshi said that Sindh was passing through a difficult situation.
He said: “Outsiders are being settled in Karachi as large housing schemes like Bahrai Town Karachi are aimed at turning Sindhis into a minority”.
Jeay Sindh Mahaz chairman Riaz Chandio claimed that Sindh had deliberately been deprived of its resources.
He urged the people to promote education as it would end hunger and poverty and enhance prestige of Sindhis.
Meanwhile jubilant crowds celebrated Sindh Culture Day in Hyderabad, Larkana, Sukkur, Shikarpur, Jacobabad, Tangwani, Kashmore-Kandhkot, Khairpur, Pano Aqil, Ghotki, Mirpur Mathelo, Mehar, KN Shah, Johi, Sehwan, Sann, Jamshoro, Kotri, Nooriabad, Shaheed Benazirabad, Naushahro Feroze, Sanghar, Mirpurkhas, Mirwah Gorchani, Digri, Jhuddo, Tando Jan Mohammad, Naokot, Kot Ghulam Mohammad, Sindhri, Phuladyyoon, Hingorno, Khaan, Jhilori, Badin, Golarchi, Matli, Talhar, Tando Bago, Kadhan, Kario Ganwher and other towns on Sunday.

1,Most manslaughter cases in Karachi end up in pardon after heirs take blood money,The complainants in many cases backed out from their claims and agreed to a compromise with alleged offenders.,"KARACHI: The ongoing judicial activism and reforms have yet to build people’s confidence in the system as several high-profile cases, which sent ripples across the country and won much media fanfare, ended with compromises that too interestingly from the weaker section of the society where complainants withdrew their pleas or agreed for out-of-court settlements.
The complainants in many cases backed out from their claims and agreed to a compromise with alleged offenders.
The cases included the death of a nine-month-old girl, Nashwa, because of alleged “negligence” at one of the famous private hospitals; the death of six members of a family in a Qasr-i-Naz room and the killing of two young siblings who died from food poisoning after consuming meals from a city’s famous eatery.
Then there was another high-profile case of six labourers who had fallen to death while working at a multi-storey under-construction building in Clifton. All of these incidents had taken place during 2019 and were decided by the courts after the suspects, who were mostly wealthy and mighty, had paid diyat (blood money) to the families of the victims who in turn had withdrawn their cases.
It did not end here as the ongoing case of the death of 16 workers in a fire incident in a Korangi factory in August this year, is most likely to meet the same fate.
Recently, factory owner Hassan Ali Meetha and building owner Faisal Tariq along with four of their detained employees were released on bail by District and Sessions Judge (East) Khalid Hussain Shahani after they paid Rs4.2 million diyat to the family of each victim.
However, an analysis of the cases suggested that the incidents involving financially well-off families had compromised murder cases on humanitarian grounds and did not accept blood money from the accused persons.
Twins’ death from food poisoning
In November 2018, two brothers — five-year-old Muhammad and one-and-half-year-old Ahmed — died after consuming food from an upscale restaurant, Arizona Grill, in Zamzama, Defence.
The incident that created much debate on the quality standards at eateries ended in January 2019 with the suspects acquitted by a court as the victims’ parents pardoned them.
Refusing the blood money, the parents had filed affidavits with the trial court stating that they had pardoned the restaurant’s owner and staffers in the name of the Almighty Allah without any fear or pressure.
Deaths in guesthouse
In March 2019, in yet another unfortunate incident, five siblings and their aunt died after consuming toxic gas during their overnight stay at a guesthouse in the metropolis.
A couple along with their five children — aged between 1.5 years to 10 — arrived from Pishin and stayed at Qasr-i-Naz and found death on Feb 22. It turned out to be an act of negligence on the part of the state-run facility’s management as well as health authorities when medical and chemical analysis reports revealed that the cause of their death was consuming poisonous gas — illegally sold in the market openly — used by the guesthouse’s staffers to kill mosquitoes, etc.
Once again, the victims’ legal heirs forgave the suspects in the name of the Almighty Allah, without any fear or pressure or compensation.
“No blood money was accepted by the victims’ family, but they withdraw the case and pardoned the accused persons on humanitarian grounds,” Inspector Atique, the investigating officer of the case, had told Dawn at the time.
Pardon for a cause
In some cases, bereaved families pardoned the accused putting up certain terms and conditions “for a cause”.
For example, in the case of Nashwa, her parents had pardoned the accused in the name of the Allah without any fear or pressure, subject to certain terms and conditions, including establishing a Nashwa Fund to help educate poor and needy medical students by the management of the Darul Sehat Hospital.
The case pertaining to the death of 10-year-old Amal Umer during a shoot-out in August 2018 had led to the passage of a law — the Sindh Injured Persons’ Compulsory Medical Treatment (Amal Umer) Bill — to ensure instant medical aid to every injured person before ‘medico-legal formalities’ are performed at health facilities.
Amal’s family had campaigned aggressively to ensure that every injured person is provided immediate medical aid before indulging into the complicated medico-legal procedures at hospitals.
In most of the cases, bereaved families are not financially strong enough because of losing their breadwinners in incidents or accidents, thus they opt to pardon the accused persons against blood money.
In the case pertaining to the death of six labourers, families had signed a compromise with the builder and others against the payment of blood money.
What’s compromise
“In almost all such cases, police lodge FIRs under Section 322 (qatl-bis-sabab or manslaughter) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC),” senior lawyer Shaukat Hayat told Dawn. “The section provides for parties to compromise a case involving death(s) of anyone, if during the investigation, it is proved that such an act was ‘unintentional’.”
Subsequently, judicial record suggested that the legal heirs of the victims in those cases had compromised the matter with the nominated accused persons in terms of Section 435 of the criminal procedure code (CrPC). The accused were initially released from the custody and then acquitted of the charges.
In most of the cases, victim(s) legal heir file a personal affidavit signed by them stating they have pardoned the accused in the name of the Almighty without any fear or pressure. However, behind the scene the accused settle the matter out of court by paying blood money to the family of the victim(s).
Mistrust in system
In most of the cases, poor families opined that even if they had pursued the legal battle, they would have hardly won it because of the legal complications in police investigation and lengthy procedures.
“I think, nothing will be achieved if they [accused persons] remain jailed, then who will help us,” 40-year-old Afzal Ahmed, who lost his three younger brothers in the Mehran Town factory fire, told Dawn.
“If they [accused] are out, they might at least do something for us,” he added, hoping that the Rs4.2m blood money agreed by the factory owners would be paid to help his family.
The blood money might help living family members of victims, but experts say it leads to further deterioration of the already messed-up governance system in the country.
“It is not just the suspects responsible alone, government functionaries too are equally answerable and liable to be punished since their inaction leads to the alleged violations of the law,” said Advocate Hasan Sabir, who is representing the owners of the Mehran Town factory. “The judicial magistrate has rightly held the relevant authorities responsible for the tragic death of 16 workers and asked police to also include them in the investigation,” he added.

4,PM to inaugurate Green Line bus service in Karachi on Dec 10: Asad Umar,The commercial launch of the Rs35bn federal project is expected on Dec 25.,"KARACHI: A senior member of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf said on Sunday that Prime Minister Imran Khan would inaugurate the much-awaited Green Line Bus Rapid Transit service on Dec 10.
Federal Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiative Asad Umar gave the news to the people, particularly Karachiites, on social media.
“The PM @ImranKhanPTI will inshallah inaugurate Karachi’s first modern transport system, greenline BRT, on the 10th of December,” he tweeted.

 



 
Last month, Mr Umar had said that the commercial launch of Green Line would begin from Dec 25 and before that the prime minister would come to Karachi to inaugurate the first BRT project in the metropolis.
The Green Line project, which was launched during the era of then prime minister Nawaz Sharif, has suffered several hiccups over the years since its groundbreaking. Envisaged and executed in February 2016, the project was originally estimated to get completed within a year with an estimated cost of Rs16.85bn funded by the federal government.
However, it took more than five years and Rs35bn to finish and years of frustration, stress and painful experiences of hundreds of thousands of Karachiites who had to trudge through main Shershah Suri Road every day during painfully slow construction of the project.
Approved by the Executive Committee of National Economic Council (Ecnec), the Green Line project was executed by the Sindh Infrastructure Development Company Ltd (SIDCL). Starting from KESC Powerhouse Chowrangi in Surjani Town, the bus service is to terminate at Merewether Tower after passing through Nagan Chowrangi, North Nazimabad, Nazimabad and Gurumandir, with 21 stations along its route to cater to 300,000 passengers on a daily basis.
With over 23-kilometre dedicated tracks, including an 11km elevated section, the bus service project offers special services for the disabled.

5,Spectacular photos taken by birdwatchers exhibited,"Many of the pictures are taken at DHA Phase-8, Bahria Town, Kathore","

Two of the pictures presented in the exhibition.—Fahim Siddiqi / White Star

 
KARACHI: The two-day Feathered Friends exhibition concluded at The Ivy School here on Sunday.
Organised by Dream Merchants in collaboration with The Ivy School, this is Wildlife with Dream Merchants’ sixth photography collection of around 55 to 60 photographs taken by expert birdwatcher eyes.
There are photos by eight to nine photographers, including Mirza Naim Beg, Nusrat Ali, Saeed Jamal Tariq, Zeenat Bayat, Heba Moeen, Zoya Mukhtar, Saeed Aleem and Osama Tabani.
Each picture has a story about the model bird, its habitat and how it was captured on camera.

Many of the pictures are taken at DHA Phase-8, Bahria Town, Kathore

Telling Dawn about his enchanting photo of the spotted owlet, Nusrat Ali explained that an owlet is a small owl measuring around 21cm in size, which doesn’t have horns.
“I found it sitting inside a well at a depth of 30 to 40 feet,” said Ali.
“I had to lie down on the ground with a friend tightly holding onto my legs as I reached down as far as I could with my camera for this picture,” he added.
“It is quite a captivating capture, too, as no matter which angle you view it from, the owl’s bright yellow eyes follow you.”
The picture was taken in Kathore, near Bahria Town.
The photographer lamented about habitat loss in the area, saying that the place used to have plenty of white-footed foxes, golden jackals besides a vast species of birds, which were vanishing now.

“The people moving to Bahria Town need to understand that it is these animals’ natural habitat. They are not to shoo them away,” he said.
Another of his photos is the one shot at Langh Lake in Larkana of a purple heron. “The purple heron is a large size bird, measuring about 78 to 90cm with amazing colours,” said Ali. The bird’s long beak indicates that it probably hunts fish. The photographer nodded. “Yes, fish, frogs, etc,” he said, adding that Langh Lake is a wildlife sanctuary where poaching and hunting are banned, though you can shoot pictures of course.
More from his own collection included the Egyptian vulture from Mithi, Tharparkar, which, he said, was endangered as it was decreasing in numbers the world over. “Vultures are cleaners of the environment. They eat dead flesh before it rots and stop the spread of viruses and disease,” Ali pointed out.
There was a mesmerising picture of a cinereous vulture bullying a steppe eagle off the M-9 Motorway taken by senior wildlife photographer and founder of the Dream Merchants Mirza Naim Beg. About the photo, it was explained that there were many poultry farms along the highway and they dump their dead chickens there, which the vultures feed on. The cinereous vulture is a huge bird. When it opens its wings, its wingspan measures some nine feet. The picture was taken during a bird fight for food where the big vulture dwarfed its opponent the steppe eagle which itself is not that small a bird.
Other photographs by other hobbyist birdwatcher photographers at the exhibition included pictures of the European roller, the Indian roller, the laughing dove, the osprey, the white cheeked bulbul, the yellow footed green pigeon as well as the Green Bee Eater because it eats honeybees. “Many of these birds are found around Karachi, especially in the DHA Phase-8 area. They feed on fish, rodents and insects while helping our agriculture to flourish,” said the photographer.
There were also pictures of the migratory ducks that fly here from Siberia. “Sadly they are hunted and poached here,” said Ali. “Hunting one or two is still acceptable but killing 200 to 300 for fun on each outing is devastating for the environment,” he said.

6,Need stressed for actions to promote social inclusivity,Increased screen time contributing to development delays among children with special needs,"KARACHI: Highlighting the challenges faced by children with special needs and their parents, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic, experts at an event called for actions at the individual, community and government level that promote diversity, equity and social inclusivity.
They were speaking at the event named “Early Intervention, Inclusion, Coping with the Pandemic” held in connection with the World Disability Day the other day organised by The Circle-Caring for Children, a therapy centre.
The WHO theme of this year’s World Disability Day is “Leadership and Participation of Persons with Disabilities Towards an Inclusive, Accessible and Sustainable Post-Covid-19 World”.
Starting off the discussion, therapy centre chief executive officer and chief speech- language pathologist Sadaf Mateen spoke about the changes brought to therapy by the pandemic.

Increased screen time contributing to development delays among children with special needs

“Getting children with special needs to sit in front of a screen for their therapy sessions was difficult, and parents had to take on that challenge. Once they did, a new relationship started to develop between the therapist, child and their families, within a more natural home environment,” she shared, adding that the results turned out to be amazing.
Eva Barner, senior speech-language pathologist and trainer, joined the discussion through Zoom from Austria. Talking about how increased screen time was contributing to development delays, she said children were not getting the concrete sensory experience, which was needed for their proper sensory learning.
“The present circumstances created a crisis due to inadequate sensory experiences, causing neuronal deprivation and malnourished memory,” she said.
Discussing evolution of the brain, Ms Eva also said it had matured greatly over 1.5 million years and enabled humans to have better memory and creative rational thinking.
“However, the current digital age is adversely affecting this, bringing about visual perceptual issues, and autism-like symptoms. The management of these changes can be achieved through therapy, which helps in circuiting the brain for effective functioning,” she pointed out while emphasizing the need for restrictive use of gadgets, especially for children.
Dr Muneera Rasheed, a clinical psychologist, regretted that parents of children with disabilities continued to face the question whether their child would be accepted by society.
“Unfortunately, the current value system isn’t very supportive towards inclusivity. Therefore, there is a dire need of a model focusing on awareness of attributes and differences on personal as well as community level,” she noted, underscoring the need for studies on how the pandemic affected people with disabilities.
Abid Hassan, communication specialist at Unicef and the main leader of a polio eradication campaign, also spoke.

7,This week 50 years ago: Indian Air Force’s bombing of Karachi and Lenin Prize,"THE situation in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) had set off alarm bells for the entire region. Karachi, being the...","


 
THE situation in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) had set off alarm bells for the entire region. Karachi, being the demographically largest city and the economic hub of Pakistan, was on the enemy forces’ hit list. On the night of Dec 8-Dec 9, 1971 the Indian Air Force (IAF) bombed several areas of Karachi. The dastardly attack by Indian bombers killed 20 people and injured 109 — an intentional act of brutality.
Eyewitnesses in Defence Society, Reti Lines, Sultanabad, Bihar Colony and other affected neighbourhoods told the media that the invading planes threw flares to light up the entire areas and then selected their targets. The scenes of devastation in all the civilian pieces of land where nearly a dozen heavy bombs were dropped were gruesome. Houses were razed to the ground and people including children were killed. In Defence Society, six bungalows were completely destroyed. Others within a distance of some furlongs suffered extensive damage while windows and doors of the houses even far beyond, too, did not escape damage.
In Habib School, one bomb dropped very close to the swimming pool, science laboratory and a three-storey block of classrooms, and another just next to it, killing all those who were there. In Reti Lines, two bombs caused similar devastation, destroying a large number of houses and hutments.
Immediately after the attack, people rushed to lend all kinds of support to those who were affected by it. And they weren’t just fellow countrymen: on Dec 9, 25 Arab students donated blood at Civil Hospital for war victims of Bihar Colony and other parts of the city. Then the first batch of 15 Pakistan International Airlines’ (PIA) employees donated blood at the Jinnah Post-Graduate Medical Centre (JPMC). Apart from that, the students of the Dow Medical College (DMC) set up a free canteen service for the injured (and their relatives) admitted to Civil Hospital.
Alongside it, the process of rendering services as volunteers and razakars was going on. The same day, it was reported that over 300 women had already registered themselves as All Pakistan Women’s Association (APWA) razakars and subcommittees of the association had been formed for emergency relief work.
Men of letters did their bit as well. On Dec 10, a meeting of writers and intellectuals of Karachi under the auspices of the Pakistan Writes Guild (PWG) appealed to all peace loving nations to help Pakistan and its people to fight the expansionist designs and naked aggression of India. In a resolution adopted at the meeting, the writers asked their counterparts in India and Russia not to support fascist activities of their rulers; and that they should not stand for the criminal deeds of the war lords of their countries only because they belonged to India and Russia.
On the subject of writers, eminent poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz was in the news that week due to the environment that had engulfed the country. He was being asked to relinquish the Lenin Peace Prize that he had received in 1962. On Dec 11, Faiz categorically said that he would not renounce the Lenin Peace Prize. In a press statement he emphasised, “This award has nothing to do either with the present Soviet leadership or ever with the Soviet government,” adding, “nothing will persuade me to insult the name of Lenin, the great champion of the oppressed and downtrodden all over the world… I have in no way renounced the ideals of that this award stands for.”

He told local reporters that the activity was making canal water dangerous for lands and people’s health. People use the water for drinking purpose and the contamination poses a serious threat to public health, according to him.
He pointed out that the influential landowners had fixed heavy pumping machines to draw the subsoil water and dispose it of into the canal, meant for irrigation.
He regretted that the authorities concerned were paying no heed to SAB’s repeated complaints in this regard. He apprehended that the local officials concerned were reluctant to lay hands on the culprits due to their political clout.
He urged the chief minister, irrigation minister and secretary as well as other authorities concerned to take notice of the illegal activity and get the pumping machines removed in order to save fertility of the lands and also health of local people from harm.

11,Several road projects inaugurated in Umerkot,Murad Saeed says PTI will form govt in Sindh after 2023 general elections,"UMERKOT: Federal Minister for Communication and Postal Services Murad Saeed on Sunday inaugurated the Bachao Bund-Raja Rasti section and Umerkot-Chhor road recently widened by the National Highway Authority. He also laid the foundation stone of several other development projects costing Rs950 million. The projects are aimed at providing better travel facility to the people of Umerkot, Tharparkar and Mirpurkhas and visitors to these districts.
Senior NHA officers briefed the minister about the road projects.
Sindh Governor Imran Ismail, Leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh, MNA Lal Chand Malhi and local leaders of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) accompanied the federal minister during his visit to Umerkot.
Murad Saeed also addressed PTI workers’ convention and public meeting, which coincided with the ‘Sindh Culture Day’ observed across Sindh on Sunday. MNA Malhi organised a rally, to mark the day, which was attended by the governor, federal minister and all PTI leaders and activists present at the events. They congratulated the people of Sindh on the occasion.

Murad Saeed says PTI will form govt in Sindh after 2023 general elections

Foreign Minister Makhdoom Shah Mehmood Qureshi also addressed the rally and workers’ convention by phone.
Speaking at the public meeting, held at Allah Wala Chowk, Murad Saeed said that Pakistan Peoples Party had ruined Sindh during its 13 years of rule over it. “It has destroyed the education, health and all other sectors and failed to provide basic amenities to the masses,” he added.
The minister said that the Sindh government also failed to maintain law and order in the province. “Police are being used to implicate PTI leaders and other political opponents in fake cases for raising their voice against PPP leaders’ misdeeds,” he alleged.
Mr Saeed said that [PPP chairman] Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari portrayed his party as ‘champion of democracy’ but it was not allowing Leader of the Opposition Haleem Sheikh even to speak in the Sindh Assembly.
“No member of the opposition has been given representation in Sindh Assembly’s committees,” he said, and wondered that Faryal Talpur and Sharjeel Inam Memon were picked as members of the accountability committee of the house.
The federal minister pointed out that Prime Minister Imran Khan introduced ‘Insaf Health Card’ for the poor. People of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan have been availing this great facility. People of Punjab will also get it next month. “But the Sindh chief minister and Zardari-League are not allowing introduction of the facility in this province,” he regretted.
Murad Saeed also accused Sindh government of committing mega corruption claiming that the federal government had released Rs600 billion for the people of Sindh but the provincial government deposited this huge amount into [Asif Ali] Zardari’s fake accounts.
“The prices of wheat flour, sugar and other essential commodities in Sindh are higher as compared to those in other provinces due to wrong policies and corrupt practices of the provincial government,” he said
The PTI minister held PPP co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari responsible for the bad governance and anti-people policies, and alleged that he was involved in occupying almost all sugar mills in the province by misusing the state authority.
He said people had now developed political sense and would reject anti-people forces next time. He expressed his confidence that the PTI would emerge victorious in the 2023 general elections and form its government in this province as well.
Addressing the workers’ convention, Governor Imran Ismail said he had been receiving complaints against the police department and Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (Hesco). He warned the inspector-general of police against recruiting criminals in his department. When PTI would form its government in Sindh, such elements would find no place to hide, he said.
He also asked Hesco to stop causing trouble and inconvenience to its consumers. “Hesco is a federal institution but it is creating problems for people,” he remarked, and held out the assurance that he would take up the power utility’s performance with Prime Minister Imran Khan.

The secretary could not post an officer of BS-20 considering the fact that the posting /transfer of an officer of this grade is the domain of the provincial chief secretary. To justify the intended posting as a stopgap arrangement, the secretary has in the Dec 2 notification mentioned that “important court matters, pension cases as well as administrative matters are pending due to non availability of chief conservator”.
It is learnt that the secretary has not sought approval for this arrangement from the chief secretary.
Insiders claim that the CS Sindh might not have approved it in the wake of repeated Sindh High Court orders against ‘additional charge’, ‘stopgap arrangements’ and posting on ‘own pay scale’ (OPS) basis in provincial departments.
The post of chief conservator (riverine and inland forests) had been lying vacant for over a month. Ejaz Nizamani was posted here but the relevant order was withdrawn reportedly for want of approval from leadership of the ruling party.
Sindh forest department had until recently been engaged actively in the retrieval of riverine forestland across the province under SHC Sukkur bench’s directives. The operation, however, slowed down considerably after change of portfolios. Earlier, Syed Nasir Hussain Shah had been holding the forests portfolio which has now been given to Nawab Taimur Talpur. Many other officers have also been transferred/posted by forest secretary.
For the first time, lands of riverine forests are being demarcated under high court’s orders. It is being mutated in revenue records. Massive encroachments of lands of riverine forests are being gradually cleared through back-to-back operations by law enforcement agencies.
These encroachments were in the shape of agricultural activity over forestland and different other structures. The high court had called for clearing forestland of all agricultural activity and preserving them only for forestation purposes in line with the colonial era Forest Act 1927. It was in this backdrop that the court has also stayed implementation of the Sindh Sustainable Forest Management Policy 2019.
During the Musharraf era Forest Policy 2004-05, lands were doled out to influential landowners, mostly politicians, serving and retired law enforcers, bureaucrats etc.
Over the years, Sindh stood deprived of its otherwise rich forest cover. But it is learnt that now again forestlands are being brought under cultivation apparently with a tacit approval of forest department, bringing the entire exercise of retrieval of forestland to a naught.

The police believed that the attack was carried out over an old enmity between two rival groups belonging to the Banglani community.
