0,Mobile library restarts in Afghan capital,"It is one of five buses leased by a local organisation called Charmaghz, established by an Afghan graduate from Oxford University.","KABUL: A mobile library bus chugged to a Kabul orphanage on Sunday and opened its doors for the first time since the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan, eliciting beaming smiles from children.
“I’m really feeling happy. I’m studying the books I love again,” says 11-year-old Arezo Azizi, whose favourite tome is a counting aid about a cat who gets more pieces of cheese the higher it can count.
The library  “didn’t come for three months, until now,” she explains, sitting on a converted public bus and her voice rising above the excited chatter of her peers. 
The mobile library is one of five buses leased by a local organisation called Charmaghz, established by Freshta Karim, an Afghan graduate from Oxford University.
Hundreds of children have in recent years made use of the mobile libraries daily as they criss-crossed Kabul, as many schools lack their own library.
But  “we lost almost all of our sponsors after the government was taken (over) by the Taliban” in-mid August, says Ahmad Fahim Barakati, deputy head of the non-profit initiative.
The Taliban’s education ministry granted permission for the mobile libraries to restart several weeks ago. But it was only a few days ago that agreement was reached with the transport ministry, which owns the buses, Barakati explained.
Like the children, librarian Ramzia Abdi Khail, 22, is visibly happy that the show is back on the road. “It’s a lovely feeling. Currently, the schools are also closed,” she notes. Girls’ education has been hit particularly hard by the Taliban’s return to power, as millions of girls across the country have been barred from secondary education in state schools.

1,CNN fires anchor Chris Cuomo over help he gave to politician brother,"“This is not how I want my time at CNN to end but I have already told you why and how I helped my brother,” says Chris Cuomo.","WASHINGTON: CNN fired veteran anchor and correspondent Chris Cuomo, the cable news channel said on Saturday, amid an investigation into his involvement with helping defend brother Andrew Cuomo, the former New York governor, against sexual misconduct allegations. 
Chris Cuomo had been suspended from CNN over the matter just days before his termination. 
“We retained a respected law firm to conduct the review, and have terminated him, effective immediately,” a statement posted to CNN’s official communications Twitter account said. 
“While in the process of that review, additional information has come to light.” 

 



 
The termination of services comes after documents surfaced showing that Cuomo, who anchored the 9pm news slot, offered advice to his politician brother that was deemed too close for comfort by his employer. 
“The documents, which we were not privy to before their public release, raise serious questions,” a CNN spokesperson said on Tuesday, adding they “point to a greater level of involvement in his brother’s efforts than we previously knew”. 
CNN on Saturday found itself in the awkward position of reporting on the firing of one of its own anchors. 
“This is not how I want my time at CNN to end but I have already told you why and how I helped my brother,” Cuomo, 51, said in a text message read out on the air by CNN media reporter Brian Stelter. 
“So let me now say as disappointing as this is, I could not be more proud of the team at ‘Cuomo Prime Time’,” Cuomo added. “I owe them all and will miss that group of special people who did really important work.” 
Cuomo has spoken candidly of his strong bond with his older sibling. 
“He’s my brother. And if I can help my brother, I do. If he wants me to hear something, I will. If he wants me to weigh in on something, I’ll try,” he told investigators in July when asked about the counsel he had offered.

2,Veteran US senator and war hero Bob Dole dies at 98,"WASHINGTON: Bob Dole, who overcame grievous World War Two combat wounds to become a pre-eminent figure in US ...","


 
WASHINGTON: Bob Dole, who overcame grievous World War Two combat wounds to become a pre-eminent figure in US politics as a longtime Republican senator from Kansas and his party’s unsuccessful 1996 presidential nominee, died on Sunday. He was 98.
Dole, known for a wit that ranged from self-deprecating to caustic, died in his sleep, the Elizabeth Dole Foundation said. Dole announced in February that he had been diagnosed with advanced lung cancer and would begin treatment.
“It is with heavy hearts we announce that Senator Robert Joseph Dole died early this morning,” the foundation said in a statement on Twitter. “He had served the United States of America faithfully for 79 years.” Dole sought the presidency three times and was the Republican Party’s nominee in 1996 but lost to Democratic incumbent Bill Clinton. Dole was his party’s vice presidential nominee in 1976 on a ticket headed by incumbent President Gerald Ford but they lost to Democrat Jimmy Carter and his running mate Walter Mondale.
Dole, known for referring to himself in the third person, made a classic American journey from the poverty of the Great Depression of the 1930s, through World War Two battlefields to the corridors of power with a stoic Midwestern dignity.
He represented Kansas in Congress for 35 years: 1961 to 1969 in the House of Representatives and 1969 to 1996 in the Senate. Dole helped shepherd Re­publican President Ronald Reagan’s legislative agenda as Senate majority leader in the 1980s and spearheaded important legislation of his own.
Dole, who lost the use of his right arm from a war wound, was an advocate for the disabled and worked to shore up the finances of the Social Security retirement program. Dole was instrumental in passage of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability in employment, public accommodations and transportation.
He also was a key figure behind building a memorial honoring Americans who served in World War Two on Washington’s National Mall, now a popular tourist stop.
President Joe Biden fondly recalled his visit to Dole in February at the Watergate complex in Washington where he lived.
“We picked up right where we left off, as though it were only yesterday that we were sharing a laugh in the Senate dining room or debating the great issues of the day, often against 
each other, on the Senate floor,” Biden said in a statement.

3,Police on alert as  far-right candidate holds rally in Paris,PARIS: Thousands of supporters of French far-right presidential candidate Eric Zemmour gathered at a stadium outside...,"PARIS: Thousands of supporters of French far-right presidential candidate Eric Zemmour gathered at a stadium outside Paris on Sunday to kick off his first official campaign rally, with police on high alert over the risk of clashes with protesters.
Zemmour, a 63-year-old author and television pundit, announced on Tuesday that he would run in next April’s election, joining the field of challengers seeking to unseat centrist President Emmanuel Macron.
Waving French flags and chanting  “Zezu President!” or singing the Marseillaise national anthem, fans waited amid flyers proclaiming an anti-immigrant candidacy  “so that France remains French.” The rally is also a chance for Zemmour to regain momentum after stumbling in opinion polls following his dramatic entrance into French politics in September.
“We’re hoping that by announcing his candidacy and with this meeting that it will relaunch him a bit,” said Maxence Mike, 22, student from the Paris suburb of Montargis and member of the  “Generation Z” association.
“There’s a malaise in France, a crisis of civilisations and security problems, and for now he’s the only one with the courage to pose these problems clearly,” said Jacques Ohana, a 65-year-old Paris surgeon, who noted that like Zemmour he had north African origins.
Around 19,000 people have signed up for the event, according to Zemmour’s campaign, leading him to swap a concert hall for a larger capacity exhibition space in the Villepinte suburb northeast of the capital.
Police are on alert for far-left activists and anarchists who disrupted Zemmour’s trip last weekend to the southern of port city of Marseille, which ended with the candidate showing the middle finger to a woman who was protesting.
Riot police massed outside the arena and searched people’s bags as they arrived. In Paris, a few hundred people marched to protest a candidacy denounced as racist and divisive.
“It’s important to show that we won’t let fascism gain ground,” Simon Duteil, a spokesperson for the Solidaires union, said.
Until now, Zemmour had been travelling the country doing promotional events for his latest book — “France has not said its final word” — which served as a thinly disguised pre-campaign tour.
As well as a series of recent missteps, including the middle-finger incident, Zemmour has seen several influential figures on the far-right distance themselves from him, including his main financial backer.
Polls show that voters currently believe Marine Le Pen, the veteran leader of the far-right National Rally party, would make a more competent president than Zemmour, who is viewed as highly divisive and arrogant by a large majority.
The latest surveys suggest he would be eliminated in the first round if the election were held now, with Macron tipped to win ahead of Le Pen, but analysts warn that the outcome remains highly uncertain.
Zemmour launched his bid for the presidency on Tuesday in a highly unusual video posted on YouTube, which saw him read a speech into an old-fashioned microphone while seated at a desk and barely looking into the camera.
It was intended to recall the famous June 1940 address by war hero General Charles De Gaulle to carry on with resistance to the Nazi occupation of France.
Over images of riots, Islamic prayers and terror attacks, Zemmour warned that France was in danger of being  “conquered” or “colonised” by immigrants and that French people were being “replaced.” 
His friend Robert Menard, a far-right mayor of the southern town of Beziers and an influential figure in far-right circles, called the rally on Sunday “an audacious bet. He needs to pull it off.”
Menard described the YouTube video as being of  “apocalyptic darkness” and said Zemmour would need to begin outlining concrete proposals.

4,Clashes erupt at Brussels protest against Covid rules,BRUSSELS: Belgian police fired water cannon on Sunday to disperse protesters opposed to compulsory health measures...,"BRUSSELS: Belgian police fired water cannon on Sunday to disperse protesters opposed to compulsory health measures against the coronavirus pandemic.
Some 8,000 people marched through Brussels towards the headquarters of the European Union, chanting  “Freedom!” and letting off fireworks.
The crowd was smaller than the 35,000 vaccine and lockdown sceptics who marched last month, and police were better prepared.
Protesters were blocked from reaching the roundabout outside the EU headquarters by a barbed wire barricade and a line of riot officers.
As two drones and a helicopter circled overhead, they threw fireworks and beer cans. Police responded with water cannon and tear gas.
As the crowd dispersed into smaller groups around the European quarter, there were more clashes and some set fire to barricades of rubbish.
Several European countries have seen demonstrations in recent weeks as governments respond to a surge in Covid cases with tighter restrictions.
In Brussels, the organisers hoped to match the November 21 demo, in which police seemed caught off guard and there were violent clashes.
The demonstrators oppose compulsory health measures — such as masks, lockdowns and vaccine passes — and some share conspiracy theories.
Banners on Sunday compared the stigmatisation of the non-vaccinated to the treatment of Jews forced to wear yellow stars in Nazi Germany.
“Covid = Organised Genocide,” said one sign.  “The QR code is a Swastika,” declared another, referring to the EU Covid safe digital certificate.
Parents — some of whom brought small children to the protest — chanted their belief that the vaccine would make their toddlers sick.
Off duty firefighters in uniform, marched at the head of the protest as it wound its way through the city, to demand the right to refuse vaccination.
The measures imposed to fight Covid in Belgium were decided by the country’ own national and regional governments, but the European Union has also attracted the sceptics’ anger.
On Wednesday, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said that in her view it was time to  “think about mandatory vaccination”, a suggestion that was denounced by speakers at the protest.
On Friday, Belgian Prime Minister Alexander de Croo announced a series of measures to tighten sanitary rules, bringing school Christmas holidays forward and asking children aged six and over to wear masks.
Belgium, with a population of 11 million, has recorded an average of more than 17,800 daily infections with Covid-19 over the past seven days, as well as 44 deaths.
Around 800 people with severe forms of the disease are in intensive care in hospitals across the country, leading to overcrowding and the postponement of treatment for many other conditions.

5,Pope calls migrant crisis ‘shipwreck of civilisation’,Pope Francis for the second straight day chided those who use the migration crisis for political ends.,"LESBOS: Pope Francis condemned the exploitation of migrants for political purposes during a visit to the Greek island of Lesbos on Sunday, branding the global indifference to their plight the  “shipwreck of civilisation”.
Pope Francis walked through the Mavrovouni camp, which holds about 2,300 people, stopping to greet dozens of refugees and giving a high five to a young African boy.
He first visited the island, one of the main entry points for migrants, in 2016 and took 12 Syrian refugees back to Italy with him. He lamented that  “little has changed” since then.
The Mediterranean, where thousands have died trying to make the crossing from north Africa to Europe, was still  “a grim cemetery without tombstones”. “Please, let us stop this shipwreck of civilisation!” he said.
Pope Francis for the second straight day chided those who use the migration crisis for political ends.
“It is easy to stir up public opinion by instilling fear of others,” he said, adding that people who are anti-immigrant  “fail to speak with equal vehemence” about the exploitation of the poor, wars, and the arms industry.
“The remote causes should be attacked, not the poor people who pay the consequences and are even used for political propaganda,” he said.
The camp, set up in a old army firing range, is made up of dozens of prefabricated structures, some similar to shipping containers and other, smaller ones made of plastic.
The spaces between the structures are like streets of a bleak village where people live in limbo. Baby carriages and children’s tricycles leaned on the home of one Afghan couple.
Sitting on a chair under a tent with the sea behind him, the pope listened to Christian Tango Mukaya, a 30-year-old refugee from the Democratic Republic of Congo who has been at the camp with two of his children for a year. He has not had contact with his wife and another child since he arrived.
Mavrovouni, whose perimeter is surrounded by cement, barbed wire and the sea, replaced the notorious Moria camp that burned down last year. The pope visited several families there at the end of his morning visit.
Departing from his prepared address, the pope said it was  “distressing” to hear that some European leaders wanted to use common funds to build a wall and put up barbed wire to keep immigrants out. “We are in the era of walls and barbed wire,” he said.
Poland’s prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki has called for the EU to jointly finance a border wall to stem the tide of migrants coming from the Middle East through Belarus into Poland.
As grim and bleak as Mavrovouni is, it is a marked improvement over Moria, which human rights groups decried for its squalid and overcrowded conditions.
Greece has long been the main entry point into the European Union for migrants and refugees fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East, Asia and Africa. Hundreds of thousands of people arrived on Lesbos’s beaches in 2015 after crossing on boats from Turkey.
Joshue, an 18-year-old refugee from Congo, was among those who welcomed the pope’s visit.
“It’s not like hearing it from afar, he came to the field to see how we live, to see how things happen here, so it gives us hope and strength knowing that such a leader is thinking about us,” he said.

6,Three feared dead as Myanmar army truck runs down protesters,Security forces have previously used cars to attack protesters since the army took power.,"BANGKOK: An army vehicle barreled into a peaceful march of anti-government protesters in military-ruled Myanmar’s biggest city on Sunday, reportedly killing at least three people, witnesses and a protest organiser said.
Sunday’s march was one of at least three held in Yangon, and similar rallies were reported in other parts of the country a day ahead of an expected verdict in the first of about a dozen criminal cases against Myanmar civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who was toppled in a military takeover Feb 1.
A video posted on social media showed a speeding small army truck heading into the marchers from behind. Voices can be heard, saying: The car is coming ... Please help! It hit the children ... Oh! ... Dead! ... Run, ... run! The video shows about a dozen people running from the spot.
A witness said that the protesters had been on his street for just two minutes when the military truck hit them, leaving three people lying motionless on the road. About five armed soldiers got out of the vehicle and chased after the protesters, said the witness, who insisted on anonymity for fear of arrest. They opened fire and also arrested young people who had been hit by the car. At least 10 people were arrested.
A worker for a local emergency rescue team, who also insisted on anonymity, said it brought two men and a woman, all in their early 20s and seriously injured, to a military hospital for treatment. State television reported that 11 protesters had been arrested, including three injured people.
Security forces have previously used cars to attack protesters since the army took power. They have also freely used live ammunition, killing about 1,300 civilians, according to a detailed list compiled by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners.
The use of lethal force by the army and police has led to less large-scale street protests, which have been replaced by small, quickly organised marches that usually break up at the first sight of the authorities.
Sunday’s deaths in Yangon’s Kyeemyindaing neighbourhood could not be immediately confirmed.
Another witness said that when several people came to gather their items, three more military vehicles arrived and arrested several of them.
At least four people, including two young girls who were crying near the shoes, were arrested, he said. The soldiers told us to go inside or they would shoot us.
A statement issued by the National Unity Government, an underground opposition group that has set itself up as the country’s parallel administration, decried the incident, in which it said five people had been killed and more seriously injured.
The randomised nature of the attacks — killing and maiming indiscriminately, is no accident. The intention of the junta is clear: create as much fear and panic as possible. Inflict as much pain, trauma, and suffering as they can, without a care as to who their victims are. Reinforce the message that anyone at any time can be killed, arrested, beaten, or wounded, simply for being in the wrong place, said the statement, signed by the groups spokesman and minister of international cooperation, Dr Sasa.
The statement reiterated the groups call for international action to help oust the military government.

7,South Africans protest against Shell oil exploration in pristine coastal area,"Locals fear the seismic blasting conducted over 6,000 square kilometres will kill or scare away the fish they depend on to live.","PORT EDWARD: South Africans took to their beaches on Sunday to protest against plans by Royal Dutch Shell to do seismic oil exploration they say will threaten marine wildlife such as whales, dolphins, seals and penguins on a pristine coastal stretch.
A South African court on Friday struck down an application brought by environmentalists to stop the oil major exploring in the eastern seaboard’s Wild Coast, rejecting as unproven their argument that it would cause  “irreparable harm” to the marine environment, especially migrating hump-back whales. The Wild Coast is home of some of the country’s most undisturbed wildlife refuges, and it’s stunning coastal wildernesses are also a major tourist draw.
At least 1,000 demonstrators gathered on a beach near Port Edward, a TV correspondent saw. “It’s just absolutely horrendous that they are even considering this. Look around you?” said demonstrator Kas Wilson, indicating an unspoilt stretch of beach.  “It’s unacceptable and ... we will stop it.”  Shell officials were not immediately available for comment, but the company said on Friday that its planned exploration has regulatory approval, and it will significantly contribute to South Africa’s energy security if resources are found.
But local people fear the seismic blasting conducted over 6,000 square kilometres will kill or scare away the fish they depend on to live.
“I don’t want them to operate here because if they do we won’t be able to catch fish,” said 62-year-old free dive fisherwoman Toloza Mzobe, after pulling a wild lobster from 
the ground. “What are we going to eat?”  Environmentalists are urging Shell and other oil companies to stop prospecting for oil, arguing that the world has no chance of reaching net zero carbon by 2050 if existing oil deposits are burned, let alone if new ones are found.

8,Saudi coalition steps up strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen,Says it hit military facilities in Sanaa and launched air strikes against Houthi front lines in Marib and Hodeida.,"CAIRO: A Saudi-led coalition fighting Iran-backed rebels in Yemen accelerated air strikes on the capital and elsewhere in the conflict-stricken country in recent weeks, as government forces advanced in the west coast and the key province of Marib, officials said on Sunday.
The coalition said it hit military facilities in rebel-held Sanaa and launched air strikes against Houthi front lines in the strategic Marib and Hodeida provinces.
Government forces, meanwhile, seized a major district in Hodeida province and other areas on Yemen’s western coast, military officials from both sides said.
The rebels did not immediately comment on government advances in Hodeida. But Houthi-run media reported dozens of air strikes by the coalition on the rebels in the provinces of Hodeida, Marib, Sanaa, Tazi and Saada.
The escalation of fighting in recent weeks comes as the rebels repeatedly push back against diplomatic efforts by the UN and US to bring an end to the Houthis’ Marib offensive and missile and drone attacks on Saudi Arabia. The UN and US want the Houthis to engage in negotiations to find a settlement to the years long conflict in Yemen.
Yemen’s war began with the 2014 takeover of Sanaa by the Houthis, who control much of the country’s north. The Saudi-led coalition entered the war in 2015, determined to restore the government and oust the rebels. The conflict has since become a regional proxy war that has killed tens of thousands of civilians and fighters. The war also created the worlds worst humanitarian crisis, leaving millions suffering from food and medical care shortages and pushing the country to the brink of famine.
The Saudi-led coalition said it launched numerous airstrikes over the past week on Houthi military camps and storehouses for ballistic missiles and explosives-laden drones in Sanaa, the Saudi Press Agency reported.
In Hodeida province, government forces seized control of the district of Hays and a major highway linking the contested port city of Hodeida with the rebel-held capital, according to military officials from both sides.
Abdu Abdullah Magli, a spokesman for the Yemeni Armed Forces, said forces advanced in the districts of Jabal Raas and Garrahi south of Hodeida city with the support of Saudi-led coalition air strikes.
The developments come three weeks after pro-government troops known as the Joint Forces redeployed forces from Hodeida, arguing that there was no need for them to stay after the UN-brokered ceasefire in 2018 that ended fighting over the coastal city.
The escalation in Hodeida was a setback to the deal that was seen as an important first step towards ending the broader conflict in Yemen, devastated by years of civil war, but was never fully implemented.
In the port city of Mocha on Yemen’s western coast, government forces launched their fiercest offensive against the Houthis in the the city in years, retaking several nearby towns in the past two weeks, said the officials.
Government forces with the help of coalition airstrikes accelerated their attacks south of Marib province, reclaiming important and strategic positions from the Houthis, said Magli, the military spokesman.
He said government forces and tribal fighters also attacked the rebels on the southern front line in Marib province, leaving dozens of Houthis dead and wounded.

9,People jabbed with Sputnik allowed to enter Saudi Arabia,Foreign tourists vaccinated with Sputnik will still be required to quarantine for 48 hours and take a PCR test.,"MOSCOW: Saudi Arabia has granted approval for people vaccinated with Russia’s Sputnik jab to enter the country in a move that will enable Muslims to take part in Haj and Umrah, the vaccine’s developers said on Sunday.
“The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has granted approval for entry of individuals vaccinated with the Russian Sputnik V vaccine starting from January 1, 2022,” the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which financed the development of Sputnik V, said in a statement. The decision, said the fund,  “will enable Muslims from all over the world vaccinated with Sputnik V to participate in the Haj and the Umrah pilgrimages to Islam’s holiest sites in the cities of Makkah and Madina.” Foreign tourists vaccinated with Sputnik will still be required to quarantine for 48 hours and take a PCR test.
Saudi Arabia has joined more than 100 countries accepting visitors vaccinated with Sputnik, the RDIF said, adding that only 15 countries including the United States currently require travellers to be jabbed with vaccines other than Sputnik.
The Haj — a must for able-bodied Muslims at least once in their lives — typically packs millions of pilgrims into congested religious sites and could be a major source of contagion during the pandemic.

10,Threat of US sanctions may persuade states to attend democracy summit,Pakistan is among 110 countries invited to the Dec 9-10 summit but has not yet confirmed its participation.,"WASHINGTON: The US democracy summit, being held in Washington this week, will lead to imposition of sanctions on undemocratic forces, adding another reason for the invitees to attend.
Pakistan is among 110 countries invited to the Dec 9-10 summit but has not yet confirmed its participation.
Various US media outlets reported on Sunday that the US Treasury Department will impose a series of sanctions this week to mark the summit, targeting people engaged in practices that undermine democracy. The sanctions will also target those involved in serious human rights violations and corruption.
“Treasury will take a series of actions to designate individuals who are engaged in malign activities that undermine democracy and democratic institutions around the world including corruption, repression, organised crime, and serious human rights abuse,” a department spokesperson told reporters in Washington. 
The department will also announce a series of measures for closing loopholes that encourage corruption.
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington think-tank, notes that the Biden administration “opted for a big tent approach” while inviting governments to the summit. The invitees include liberal democracies, weaker democracies, and states with authoritarian characteristics as well.
The US Freedom House Index for Democracies 2021 places seventy-seven invitees among “free” or fully democratic states.
Another thirty-one rank as “partly free” and three — Angola, Congo and Iraq — as “not free.”
India, the world’s most populous democracy, dropped from “Free to Partly Free” status in 2021, along with Pakistan. The index, while explaining India’s new status, notes that “rather than serving as a champion of democratic practice and a counterweight to authoritarian influence,” India’s rulers were “tragically driving India itself toward authoritarianism.”
The Carnegie report says that eight summit invitees — including Pakistan — fall exceptionally low on democracy rankings, four — including Brazil and India — have slipped to heightened levels of democratisation over the past ten years.
Europe leads the list with thirty-nine invitees, followed closely by twenty-seven in the Western Hemisphere. The Asia Pacific and Sub-Saharan Africa have twenty-one and seventeen invitees, respectively. In contrast, the Middle East and North Africa and South and Central Asia have fewer invitees. In the Middle East, only Iraq and Israel received invitations, while South and Central Asia obtained just four invites — India, the Maldives, Nepal, and Pakistan.
The report also looks at the considerations that were at play while drawing the list.
According to the Carnegie’s report, the first consideration was regional dynamics, particularly in the Middle East where only Israel and Tunisia qualified. Unfortunately, Tunisia is experiencing a slow-motion coup, and inviting Israel as the sole representative from the Middle East was a nonstarter. And this forced Washington to invite Iraq.
Second, broader US strategic interests also mattered. Pakistan, the Philippines, and Ukraine are listed as flawed democracies with endemic corruption and rule of law abuses. “Yet they are important partners of the United States — whether to counterbalance Chinese influence (Philippines), withstand Russian encroachment (Ukraine), or assist with counter-terrorism (Pakistan).” And that’s why they were invited.
Strategic consideration was the third factor. For example, the Biden administration excluded Hungary and Turkey because of Washington’s “reluctance to help the reelection chances of Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orbán or Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.”
