The book raises a number of issues that stop the democratic institutions and norms from taking root in Pakistan. It has eight theses, explaining political, economic and social causes of authoritarianism in the country.
Dr Aliya Haider from Haqooq-e-Khalaq Movement moderated the book launch. She introduced the writer and commented on the state of affairs in the country. “The country is in the worst crisis, a glimpse of which could be seen in the Sialkot incident of which the whole country is ashamed of,” Ms Haider mourned.
Baba Latif, Sara Kazmi, Muhammad Tehseen and Farooq Tariq were speakers on the occasion.
Baba Latif shared with the audience how he started his movement and support for labourers back in 2003 from a mohallah of Faisalabad. He talked about the hindrances and difficulties he and his companions faced during that struggle of supporting the labourers in an effort to get them their rights and how he started the Labour Quami Movement from Faisalabad. He termed the book worth reading.
Sara Kazmi, a professor at LUMS, throwing light on the book said the book talked about the present struggles, updates on the left and talked about issues related to women. The book, she added, also discussed the Pushtoon movement, the role of establishment the moral panic which had gripped society and going through and feminist movement. She said the politics of the left needed to be attached with anti-colonialism.
Muhammad Tehseen from South Asia Partnership Pakistan said the book had been written for the ordinary activists and it should be read by all students. He suggested that it book should also be translated into Urdu. To Tehseen, the titles of different chapters of the book were quite interesting. The gist of the book was that one should have the power of saying ‘No’.
Tehseen condemned the Sialkot incident, saying the incident could be avoided had there been a timely police action. He also called for a united front as suggested in the book to raise the voice for the oppressed without discretion of race and religion.
Farooq Tariq, the president of the Kissan Rabta Movement, talked about the inequality and that of authoritarianism as discussed in the book. He said the writer in this book had tried to link the issues of the country with the international issues. The book, he said, was a guide for the politics of the left. He announced the Haqooq-i-Khalaq Movement would soon be registered as a political party.
The writer, Ammar Ali Jan, said struggles were like lessons one learnt from each struggle. Praising women who supported his cause, he said women remained on the front row in all campaigns. Jan said the first party he joined was the Labour Party and termed Farooq Tariq was his mentor.
He said the elite in the country had got its own privileges and perks.

The class will not only go on air at the Punjab Rung FM Radio channel but also on the upcoming Punjab Rung TV channel.
Shabnam Majeed said Pakistan had immense talent: “I am sure that from this singing class, many rough diamonds would be cut and polished and the world might get some more great singers from the younger lot”. She said singing was all about passion and God had gifted many people with melodious voices who needed a platform and a constant effort besides a dedicated will.
“I am sure that kids coming not only from Lahore but from other places too would get a platform to show their talent through the Pilac programme,” she said while talking to Dawn on Tuesday.
She lauded Pilac for providing an opportunity for the children to learn music.
“If one looks around, one would find there is little or no activity for children that is why Pilac thought to commence a singing class for them, which would initially be broadcast at Radio FM 95 Punjab Rung and later at the upcoming Punjab Rung TV,” said Pilac DG Dr Sughra Sadaf.
She said Pilac had asked Shabnam to hold singing classes for children where the children from three to 15 years of age could take admission and learn singing.
“We want to initiate a singing programme on the pattern introduced by great Sohail Rana.”
Ms Sadaf said Pilac was decorating and designing a classroom with portraits of great Pakistani singers and different music instruments, especially those on the verge of decline such as Sarangi, on display so that children should know the legacy of instruments and that of the music.
Pilac would also hold a competition every year among the class students, which would be a mega event featuring leading vocalists as judges. The best three students from the contests would be given cash prizes and certificates. This musical concert will be a permanent and a regular feature of Pilac.

4,Study highlights barriers to crime reduction,LAHORE: A joint study carried out by the researchers from leading universities of the country and the police has...,"LAHORE: A joint study carried out by the researchers from leading universities of the country and the police has found out that limited resources, chronic under-staffing, frequent transfers, and legal norms inherited from the colonial-era laws are significant barriers to reducing crime rate in Pakistan.
Researchers from the Institute of Development and Economic Alternatives (IDEAS), the LUMS and Princeton University were part of a large international study on community policing in the Global South, including Pakistan.
The Pakistan part of the study was conducted by Dr Ali Cheema (LUMS, IDEAS), Ahsan Farooqui (IDEAS), Zulfiqar Hameed (Police Services of Pakistan), Dr Ali Hasanain (LUMS) and Prof Jacob Shapiro (Princeton University). They evaluated locally-appropriate community policing programmes developed by police agencies in these contexts.
Conducted between 2016-2021, in collaboration with social scientists at universities, the study is a part of the ‘Evidence in Governance and Politics Network’s Metaketa-IV Initiative.
The researchers are of the view that the community policing was a mid-twentieth century innovation that was meant to combat citizens’ mistrust of the police force. They hope that creating local partnerships between citizens and the police would lead to reduced crime and increased trust in the police. However, in spite of its growing importance, there was little evidence on the effectiveness of community policing in the Global South, including Pakistan, the study found.
The results of the study have been published in Science, one of the world’s top academic journals.
The main question the study deals with is why didn’t learning by the police and citizens’ satisfaction lead to reduced crime in our context?” says Mr Farooqui.
“Community policing has potential in our context, however, making it successful requires embedding it in systemic reforms that address these long-standing barriers in policing,” says Dr Hasanain.
“We found that attendees of women-only forums emphasise gender-based crimes, such as harassment and domestic abuse, among their top concerns. This shows the potential of community policing in allowing the police to learn about citizens’ concerns that are typically under-reported,” Dr Cheema said.
Overall, the study finds that community policing did not lead to the hoped-for reduction in crime and building trust.
However, in Punjab, community policing led to big improvements in citizens’ views about police intentions and in their overall perceptions of the police, the researchers say.
They say it also saw a positive response from the citizens, with both men and women actively voicing issues in community meetings that tend to be under-reported to the police.
The study uses randomised-control-trials of community policing initiatives implemented by the police in six countries, including districts of Sheikhupura and Nankana in Punjab, Pakistan. In Punjab, the police experimented with two models; open community meetings and women-only meetings conducted by women police officers.
The community meetings garnered positive citizen-police engagement, providing voice to a diverse group of people who would, otherwise, have limited access to police. The attendees of women-only forums emphasised gender-based crimes, such as harassment and domestic abuse, among their top concerns.
“This shows the potential of community policing in allowing the police to learn about the importance citizens place on concerns that tend to be under-reported”, reads the study report.

The significance of human emotions in history was stressed upon by speakers at a virtual conference on “Emotions and the Subject of Modern History” organised by the Government College University’s recently established Institute of History.
The speakers discussed the history of emotions in the context of religious intolerance, institutionalisation of shrines and medieval monasteries, material culture and the creation of knowledge.
In his opening remarks, GCU Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Asghar Zaidi said: “Emotions have a history in time and undergo various transformations. In the last two decades, the study of emotions has become important for historians to study past societies.”
The VC stressed the need for understanding human emotions to enable policy institutions to devise plans that could shape societies, where people have realisation of and respect for the emotions of individuals and communities.
“I see this as the only way forward in this world, which is experiencing all kinds of extremism,” he added.
John Corrigan, a distinguished professor of religion and history of emotions at the Florida State University, discussed how emotions in American society led to religious intolerance.
Hussain Ahmad Khan, a cultural historian and director of the Institute of History explained that even inanimate objects had the power to shape historical process. In the nineteenth century, he said, Indian crafts transformed the emotions of British colonials from patronising pride to curiosity.
Albrecht Diem, a historian and an expert on late antiquity and the Middle Ages at Syracuse University, presented a paper on the regulation of passions and feelings at the monasteries.
He argued that early medieval monastic rules not only provided outlines for organising communities, behavioural norms and disciplinary measures, but also aimed at controlling, repressing and fostering emotions.
Lauren Mancia of the Brooklyn College, CUNY, described how medieval monks were prescribed emotional redirection through a process of ‘confession’ from ‘cold’ devotional feeling to “warm, or right” devotional feeling. Professor Mancia explained how even the most devout monks needed both textual and material tools to feel emotionally connected to the divine.
Ayyaz Gull, a historian at the Institute of History, explained the role of Zuljanah in morning by the Shia community in Punjab.
Yasmin Syed, from the University of Barcelona, discussed the relationship between reason, emotions, and the construction of knowledge.
Shehar Bano, from the Institute of History, highlighted the role of tears in establishing social relationships between shrine-based communities.

7,Students’ trip to Murree: Three killed as minibus falls from bridge near Jhelum,Rescue officials say accident took place when a loader tried to overtake the coaster.,"GUJRAT: A school administrator and two students died and 22 others were injured when a minibus carrying a group of students and teachers of a Lahore school to Murree fell from an overhead bridge along GT Road near Jhelum’s Dina city early on Sunday morning.
Rescue 1122 ambulances and other officials reached the spot soon after the incident and shifted the deceased and injured to Jhelum’s District Headquarters (DHQ) hospital.
Rescue officials said the accident took place when a loader tried to overtake the coaster on the overhead bridge on railway track along GT Road and the coaster veered off the road and fell on the track.
Jhelum Deputy Commissioner Nauman Hafeez Kalair who reached the spot soon after the incident told Dawn that two coasters carrying the passengers of a school trip from Inayat High School, Begumkot, Lahore, had been going to Murree hill station. Around half past four in the morning, he said, one of the coasters hit the safety railing after a loader tried to overtake it and the coaster fell on the railway track.
He said school administrator Imran, 45, and two students died while 22 others, most of them girls, were injured.
One of the critically injured persons was shifted to a Rawalpindi hospital whereas others were admitted to the Jhelum DHQ hospital where the condition of all was stated to be out of danger.

9,Wardag for no-trust move against govt,LAHORE: The opposition parties have been urged to bring a no-trust vote against the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf...,"LAHORE: The opposition parties have been urged to bring a no-trust vote against the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government “to rid the masses of incompetent and tyrannical rulers”.
The call was made by Tehreek-i-Istiqlal central president Rehmat Khan Wardag at a press conference here on Sunday.
“If the opposition is serious in ridding the people of undoubtedly incompetent and tyrannical rulers then it should immediately move a no-trust motion against the PTI government to pave way for new elections.”
He also urged Governor Chaudhry Sarwar, who has recently criticised the PTI government’s loan agreement with the IMF, and its allies – PML-Q and MQM – to part ways with the ruling party, otherwise they too would be considered “co-accused in the destruction of the country at the hands of the PTI”.
Mr Wardag said the country needed a serious leadership and not those who were adept only at table talks and were “misleading” the nation on each and every issue.
Responding to a question, he said regional development required that Pakistan, India, Iran and Afghanistan sign a no-war pact for at least 25 years and divert their defence budgets towards the social sector. He also suggested that the four countries should use local currencies for mutual trade to offset the negative impact of using dollar and European currencies for international trade.

10,Kinnow exporters hit by hike in import tax by Taliban,The Afghan government has imposed Rs33 per kg import tax on kinnow this season against Rs3.5 per kg of the previous year.,"LAHORE: An exorbitant increase in import tax on kinnow by Afghanistan’s Taliban government has worried local exporters of the citrus fruit who fear that another sector may collapse if Islamabad doesn’t take up the issue with Kabul at the earliest.
The Afghan government has imposed Rs33 per kg import tax on kinnow this season against Rs3.5 per kg of the previous year, says Shoaib Ahmad Basra, owner of a citrus polishing and grading unit at Sargodha, the heartland of kinnow fruit.
He says that there was a nominal import tax on the citrus in the Afghan market and the Ashraf Ghani government introduced Rs3.5 per kg tax only last year.
Mr Basra argues that even Rs3.5 per kg tax was unjustified because lower quality or B grade fruit, costing around Rs20 per kg, is exported to Afghanistan, while the Taliban government has pushed the levy up to whooping Rs33 per kg.
In contrast, he says, Pakistan imposes just Rs6 per kg import tax on consignments of pomegranate, grapes and apple from Afghanistan, while the market rate of each of the three fruits is over Rs100 per kg here.
Pakistan exported 85,000 tonnes of kinnow to Afghanistan last year (2020-21), 32 percent less than the previous year (2019-20). The total citrus exports in the 2020-21 season stood at 0.44 million tonnes.
Mr Basra, as Sargodha Chambers of Commerce and Industry president, had called on President Arif Alvi in Islamabad along with a delegation the other day, seeking help of the Presidency to raise the import tax issue with Afghan government, as well as to open the Iranian market for citrus exports at the earliest.
Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, after his recent visit to Tehran, had announced that the Iranian government had agreed to opening its markets for the Pakistani citrus. However, there had been no progress on the issue since then.
Mr Basra claims that Tehran is dilly-dallying with regard to issuance of citrus export permits and urges Islamabad to play a proactive role for resolving the issue before it is too late.
He says if export permits are issued in time, Pakistan can export at least 60,000 tonnes of kinnow this year.
In the past, Pakistan had been exporting up to 125,000 tonnes of citrus to Iran. Muhammad Hanif Hanjra, a kinnow grower, fears the growers will suffer financial losses if the issues related to Afghan and Iranian markets are not resolved at the earliest because exporters and kinnow polishing and grading factories will offer them reduced rates. In case the exporters suffered losses, they may also default on payments to growers, he warns.
According to him, kinnow orchard owners are already under stress because of a 40 percent drop in the fruit production this year owing to climate change and other factors and the government should take up the import tax issue on an emergent basis to save them from financial collapse.

11,Punjab completes 92pc wheat sowing,LAHORE: Punjab had completed 92 per cent of the wheat sowing target (16.67 million acres) by Dec 3 (Friday) if the...,"LAHORE: Punjab had completed 92 per cent of the wheat sowing target (16.67 million acres) by Dec 3 (Friday) if the provincial Crop Reporting Service is to be believed and it expects the process to be completed by the third week of current month.
A senior spokesman for the Agriculture Department, however, puts the figure at 95pc, saying the Crop Reporting Service was measuring the current sowing against the provincially-fixed target (16.67m acres). The federal government, however, assigned it 16.2m acres and if measured it, the provincial sowing stands at 95pc.
“The process will take two more weeks to complete because sowing process slows down in the end because of delayed sugarcane harvesting and cotton picking,” says an official of the Crop Reporting Service.
Hopefully, both these crops will fully leave the field by the last week of December and wheat will replace them.
The Punjab Agriculture Department thinks that the season is going to be “very hard for wheat” but pinning hopes in few positives should not be out of place.
“The Punjab fully concentrated on three things -- timely sowing, certified seed consumption and control of weeds. The department succeeded in first two. Over 90pc of sowing got completed within November – the most propitious time for it. The department itself provided one million bags of certified seed at subsidised rates. Weed control will come later and the department is planning to increase its usage.”
He, however, concedes that the current long dry spell will cost in the end, and so will be over 28pc water shortages. Rising fertiliser prices will certainly dent the final tally.
“How much? Only time will tell.”
The farmers, on their part, are more concerned on the negatives because they are going to cost them directly.
“No one knows what this official optimism is based upon. With Diammonium Phosphate (DAP) prices hovering beyond Rs9,000 per bag and Urea prices around Rs2,500 per bag, it does not take the genius to imagine the final outcome, laments Sarfraz Virk, a farmer from Sheikhupura.
All this will cost the crop dearly and all officials know it. They are, nevertheless, in complete denial, or feigning optimism. Only four months down the line, all of them will be explaining the factors of crop loss and deflecting the blame on the Mother Nature or market failure.
“The negatives are so many and so crucial to crop. Fertiliser can literally make or break a crop, and so is water shortage, which has its impact multiplied in the drought situation like the current one. The metrological officials are warning of heavy downpours in February, which can hurt the crop as badly as the current dry spell. Farmers are at loss to understand the reasons behind official optimism, except for an official compulsion and perfunctory nature of job.”

12,Three road projects to complete before deadline: officials,"LAHORE: City’s three major projects – Sheranwala Gate Flyover, Shahkam Chowk Flyover and Gulab Devi Underpass...","LAHORE: City’s three major projects – Sheranwala Gate Flyover, Shahkam Chowk Flyover and Gulab Devi Underpass & Widening of Lahore Bridge (Kot Lakhpat) – are likely to be completed before the deadlines as work is in full swing.
Since the Gulab Devi underpass is expected to complete soon, it will be opened for the motorists by Dec 20, Dawn has learnt.
“The work on these projects has gained the required pace we want. Therefore, we are expecting that we will complete these projects by February – one month before their deadlines,” Lahore Development Authority chief engineer Mazhar Hussain told Dawn on Sunday.
“The work on the Gulab Devi underpass is almost complete and we are planning its inauguration by Dec 20. We have also started work on widening of the Lahore Bridge known as Kot Lakhpat bridge,” he added.
The work on the aforementioned projects had been launched in June this year after the LDA completed the tendering / bidding process and awarded the projects. Though initially there was delay in land acquisition, the issues were finally resolved.
According to documents available with Dawn, about Rs5 billion Sheranwala Gate Flyover project includes Rs2.634 billion construction cost and the rest for the land acquisition / compensation cost. The flyover total length and width with ramps is 1,000 meters and 17 meters respectively with 19 spans. Besides the flyover, there are some work at grade (on ground) – two lane dual carriageway (7.3 meter width each side). In addition, the new sewerage system measuring 2,500 meters is also part of the project.
The beneficiary areas of the project include Lahore’s northern parts (Railway Station, Walled City, Akbari Mandi, Azam Cloth Market, Landa Bazaar, Badami Bagh, Shadbagh, Misri Shah, GT Road, Shah Alam Market, Data Darbar area, Brandreth Road, Azadi Chowk and areas beyond). “At present, we have completed 55 per cent of the total works,” he said, adding that the land acquisition works involved dismantling of hundreds of shops’ structure. Four plazas were also demolished,” project director Iqrar Ahmad told Dawn.
He pledged to complete the project by Jan 31 two months before the deadline. The work on Shahkam Chowk flyover had been launched in time. However, the land acquisition (64 kanal) was delayed for some time. The possession of the entire pieces of land was given to contractor last month. The project total cost is over Rs4.233 billion that includes Rs2.5487 billion construction cost. The project will end the traffic congestion at Shahkam Chowk and save time, energy and money.
“We have completed around 55 per cent work to date and are expecting the completion before Feb 15,” project director Haroon Saifi told Dawn.
As far as the completion of the Rs1.7 billion Gulab Devi underpass is concerned, the 65 works on this project have been completed. The project involves construction of an underpass and widening of the Lahore / Kot Lakhpat bridge.
“We will complete the entire project by end of January,” the LDA chief engineer said.

14,Punjab Notes: Guru/Murshid: the past weighs on the present,There is nothing surprising or abnormal about learning. We learn from others in a direct manner or indirectly. ...,"There is nothing surprising or abnormal about learning. We learn from others in a direct manner or indirectly. Direct learning implies personal contact and some sort of personal relationship, which forms a conduit through which knowledge is imparted and received. In pre-literate society, this was a standard practice. That’s why we have a long standing tradition of master and disciple, which, in our region, carries various names such as Guru and Chela and Murshid/Pir and Mureed. Before the advent of printing press when books were rare and expensive, personal contact was crucial as the proximity to the teacher or master was the stream that carried alluvial deposits to the disciple’s arid land. Transformation of land into fields depended on the master’s willingness to impart and disciple’s capacity to receive and to nurture what was received. In the absence of other means, this method evolved into a stable institution of knowledge generation in almost all fields such as religion, education, spirituality, music and crafts. It helped greatly in creating knowledge and skills in material and intellectual world as intuition and accumulated personal experience were the main sources the knowledge hinged on.
The flip side was that the relationship was reverential to the point of being irrational. It required unconditional and total submission on the part of disciple; servility bought one favour. The most obsequious students have been held out and touted as glorious examples. This orientation was wrapped in endearingly soft terms such as humility and euphemistically called etiquettes/manners (Adab) in Persian-Arabic society and tradition (Parampra) in subcontinental culture.
Both the traditions have similar ethos the chore component of which is genuflection. What it means in practice is no-questioning, elimination of doubt, absence of open debate and lulling critical faculty into sleep. All this has been practiced and accepted as a precondition for being a good disciple in all spheres, religious, spiritual and secular. Master is taken for a person of unquestionable wisdom who epitomises all the good that is in the discipline he is concerned with. This pedagogy is what is known as rote learning. Paulo Freire, an advocate of critical pedagogy, famously described it as banking concept of education. A teacher is a giver and student a taker. Student is a container like a bank account. He gets deposits from the teacher, retains it and ejects them when needed. The student is not required to process the received and examine it critically. Mind is a locker that can only expel what it receives. This method is glorified ad nauseam in our oral tradition and literature.
Master’s personal attention is the most sought after asset and his gaze is considered a repository of revelatory insights, which would illuminate the way for his disciple. In Hindu, Muslim and Sikh religious traditions authority carries the paramount importance. A student establishes his authority through the acceptance of his master’s authority. The master is thought to be almost infallible. So what is conveyed is beyond doubt. Authority, secular or otherwise, never likes to be questioned as it carries in-built sense of its own righteousness.
In spiritual and literary history examples of such a phenomenon are galore which are quoted ad infinitum as the ultimate of spiritual achievement, zenith of love and height of illumination. Who can forget Rumi and ShamsTabrizi, Amir Khusrow and Nizamuddin Aulia, Shah Husain and Madhu Lal, Bulleh Shah and Shah Inayat and Pero Preman and Ghulab Das. Rumi titled his collection of poems ‘Divan-e –Shams Tabrizi’. Amir Khusrow never got tired of waxing eloquent about Nizamuddin Aulia’s powers as a spiritual guide. Shah Husains’s love for Madhu is a legend. Bulleh Shah never ceases to sing paeans to Shah Inayat who he deems as his master as well as savior. Pero Preman abandoned her given faith to follow Ghulab Das who is for her a guru as well as a beloved.
In Indian culture, Guru and Chela evolved into a strong tradition in the period of Upanishad (Up means near, Ni means down and Shad means to sit).The term vividly evokes the image of genuflection. Dronacharya and Arjun in Mahabharata, Chanakya and King Chandragupta Maurya are present secular Guru and Chela tradition. Rama and Hanuman, and Rama and Lakshmana in Ramayana have similar relationship.
Master and disciple relationship transformed into a tradition that eventually emerged a fully-fledged institution. It certainly added to human knowledge and skills that helped improve the quality of life. But with the passage of time it started to suffer from the malaise what all institutions tend to do; self-perpetuation which is taken as raison detre of their existence. Intuitions are the means for the realisation of specific objectives. An institution becomes hollow when it assumes the power of self-perpetuating, which gives it a false sense of being an end in itself and all to itself. With the emergence of modern life, this institution has been reduced to unintelligible mumbo jumbo because new means of knowledge and enlightenment have come to the fore, which are far more rational and scientific; hence more reliable. This tradition is now a refuge of imposters and charlatans out to make a quick buck to enjoy a crassly materialistic life. They now exploit vulnerable people who are rendered helpless by myriad problems generated by a skewed social system that lacks compassion and problem-solving ability. They pretend to put an end to their apparent emotional and spiritual aridity. Helplessness breeds superstition. Human mind whenever confronted with a threatening situation invariably feels compelled to have a way out, some sort of solution. If it can’t be real, let it be airy-fairy. Psychological help, even a false hope given by swindlers pretending to be gurus, can make one stand on their feet at least for some moments. South Asia is a region where trickery is rife; Pirs, Murshids, Gurus and Babas are flies up in the air in buzzing swarms. So beware lest they contaminate your mind with old poison, which is a vestige of an era gone and dead. But the problem is that what is dead can still weigh heavily on the mind of the living with its glimmer in a society, which is less rational and dehumanized. — soofi01@hotmail.com
