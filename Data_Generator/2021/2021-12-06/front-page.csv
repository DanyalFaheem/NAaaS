NAROWAL/ LAHORE: Thirteen key suspects spotted with the help of footage were remanded by a duty magistrate in police custody till Monday when they will be produced before an anti-terrorism court for lynching of Priyantha Kumara, as the Sialkot police tightened noose around the culprits by conducting more raids.
Also, Prime Minister Imran Khan announced Tamgha-i-Shujaat, the civil award for bravery, for the victim’s colleague, Malik Adnan, who tried his utmost to rescue the Sri Lankan national on Friday when hundreds of men protesting against the alleged blasphemy by Mr Kumara attacked him at the factory where he worked as general manager, tortured him to death before setting fire to his body.
Leaders of Muslim, Christian, Hindu and Sikh communities on Sunday declared the Sialkot mob lynching ‘barbaric and brutal’, apologised to the people of Sri Lanka on behalf of the Pakistani nation and demanded that the Chief Justice of Pakistan ensure speedy trial of the culprits for early justice. 
According to the Sri Lanka foreign ministry, the human remains of Mr Kumara will be flown back home through Sri Lankan Airlines on Dec 6 (today). Police sources confirmed that the body was shifted from Sialkot to a hospital in Lahore on Saturday night for medico-legal formalities before it would be handed over to the Sri Lankan embassy officials. 
The Sri Lanka High Commission in Islamabad has already requested an investigation report from the Pakistan’s foreign ministry regarding the death of Mr Kumara. The foreign ministry also stated that the high commission was also in discussion with the Pakistani authorities and the employer of the deceased regarding payment of compensation.
The victim was general manager of Rajco Industries, situated on Wazirabad Road, where the ghastly murder took place amid violent protest against the alleged blasphemy.
According to police sources, a total of 57 suspects including some workers have been identified with the help of CCTV footage who were involved in the attack. Of them, 25 suspects had been held and raids were being conducted to arrest the 32 others, the police sources said. Police were using conventional as well as modern methods to trace them, as many fled their homes.
Despite the weekly holiday, the Uggoki police on Sunday produced the 13 main suspects — Talha, Taimor, Shahzain, Farhan, Junaid, Abdul Ghafor, Imran, Ahmed Shehroz, Ehtesham Abdul Rahman, Shoaib, Nasir Mahmood, Rohail Amjad and Nasir — before the court of duty magistrate Mohammad Zareef amid tight security arrangements in order to obtain their remand. The police apprised the duty magistrate that they would present the suspects before a special terrorism court in Gujranwala on Monday to seek further remand for interrogation. The duty magistrate remanded them in police custody for 24 hours.
The Sialkot police continued to conduct raids in different parts of the district to arrest other culprits though more than a hundred men had already been rounded up during the initial crackdown.
Inspector General of Police Rao Sardar Ali Khan told the media that seven more main suspects were arrested on Sunday as the total number of suspects swelled to 126. Of them, 20 main suspects were identified as police ascertained their role, he added. 
The police chief said investigation was under way to identify those involved in provocation for violence besides those involved in gruesome murder. 
Speaking to Dawn, Sialkot District Police Officer Omar Saeed said that 26 of the 126 suspects would be produced before an anti-terrorism court on Monday while others would be presented in a court next day. 
The DPO claimed that personnel from 27 police stations had responded to the call of the security guard about the murder of Mr Kumara. He said the mob was planning to set on fire the entire factory after lynching the Sri Lankan national, whereas a group of charged workers headed towards the residence of the factory owner to kill him and his family, too, but the timely action by the police prevented further violence. 
Award announced
Praising the courage of Mr Adnan who tried to rescue the victim, the prime minister announced a civil award for him. In a tweet, Mr Khan tweeted: “On behalf of the nation I want to salute moral courage & bravery of Malik Adnan who tried his utmost to shelter & save Priyantha Diyawadana from the vigilante mob in Sialkot incl endangering his own life by physically trying to shield victim. We will award him Tamgha i Shujaat.”

 



 
Also, leaders of Muslim, Christian, Hindu and Sikh communities in a meeting on Sunday decided that the incident should be condemned during sermons in mosques on Friday and in churches and other places of worship on Sunday across Pakistan.
Terming the Sialkot incident barbaric, they apologized on behalf of the nation and expressed solidarity with the people of Sri Lanka. They demanded speedy trial for earliest conviction of the culprits.
Speaking at a joint press conference along with them following the meeting, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Interfaith Harmony Hafiz Tahir Ashrafi said the Pakistan Ulema Council and Interfaith Harmony Council would award shields to the two young men who had tried to save the Sri Lankan manager from the mob.
He said no one had the right to take the law into hand, as a plaintiff could not be allowed to become a judge and an executor at the same time.
The Sialkot incident had been condemned by all religious and political parties and all had expressed solidarity with the victim’s family and Sri Lankan people, he said.
This individual act, the PM’s aide asserted, could not be linked with any religion, as the factory workers had a grudge against the slain factory manager who had been preventing them from shirking work.
Responding to a question, he said the FO and religious scholars were in contact with the Sri Lankan embassy and leading scholars in Sri Lanka to save Pakistan-Lanka relations.
He added that religious scholars would also accompany Minister for Religious Affairs Noorul Haq Qadri and Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) Chairman Qibla Ayyaz to the Sri Lankan embassy to offer condolence.
Hafiz Ashrafi said Friday sermons would be used to inform the people of existing blasphemy laws to curb reoccurrence of such heinous incidents.
Christian leader Father James Chunan called for creating awareness among the masses to check misuse of blasphemy laws in the country.
Dr Majeed Abel said those making false accusations of blasphemy must also be punished. 
The Khateeb of Data Darbar mosque, Ramzan Sialvi, cautioned that by associating with religion any incident executed for vested interest would weaken blasphemy laws.
Sikh leader Sardar Sikander Singh and Hindu leader Bhagat Lal Khokhar also condemned the Sialkot incident, calling it a conspiracy against Pakistan, and demanded exemplary punishment to the culprits.
Mufti Mohammad Ali Naqshbandi, Maulana Abdul Wahab Rupari, Hafiz Kazim Raza, Allama Zubair Abid, Hafiz Noman, Maulana Naeem Badshah, Maulana Mahmood Ghaznavi, Pastor Emanuel Khokhar, Maulana Mohammad Aslam Qadri, Maulana Rehmat Ali, Maulana Mohammad Shafi Qasmi, Maulana Mubashir Rahimi, Hafiz Ali Abid and others were also present.

1,PML-N wins back NA-133 seat amid low turnout,"Unofficial results show PML-N’s Shaista Pervaiz Malik bagged 46,811 votes while PPP’s Chaudhry Aslam Gill secured 32,313.","LAHORE: Amid low turnout, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) on Sunday sailed through the NA-133 by-election, which was hotly contested by the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) while a PTI candidate was knocked out on technical ground, unofficial results show.
According to unofficial results, PML-N’s Shaista Pervaiz Malik bagged 46,811 votes while PPP’s Chaudhry Aslam Gill could secure 32,313 ballots in a race that remained largely peaceful, except a couple of minor clashes between activists of the two major rivals. 
However, the voter turnout remained 18.59 per cent as out of total 440,845 voters, only 80,022 used their rights to franchise. At least 898 votes were rejected.
There were nine other contestants, independent or from little known outfits, in the competition, while the candidate of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf had already been knocked out of the contest on technical grounds. The Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), which had emerged as the third largest group in the 2018 general elections, preferred to remain out of the arena in the by-polls citing its lack of preparation owing to its engagement in a long march on Islamabad though it had called off after an agreement with the government on Nov 8.
Mr Gill had pooled only 5,500 votes in the 2018 general election for the same seat that fell vacant after the demise of PML-N MNA Pervaiz Malik, who had grabbed over 90,000 votes then.
Shaista Malik, the widow of Pervaiz Malik, did not personally take part in her election campaign for being in Iddat. Her son, Ali Pervaiz Malik, also MNA from an adjacent constituency, looked after the electioneering instead.
The Election Commission had set up at least 254 polling stations out of which 34 had been declared sensitive and 21 most sensitive. To counter any eventuality, election authorities had deployed over 2,000 police personnel, besides the Punjab Rangers. The polling process continued from 8am till 5pm without any break.
By noon, hardly two per cent of the votes had been cast predicting a low turnout for the rest of the time.
In an apparent bid to revive itself in the province, the PPP invested immense political and financial capital in the by-election, in deviation of its past practice at least in the Punjab capital considered as a citadel of the rival PML-N.
President Asif Ali Zardari, despite his health issues, remained camped in Lahore for days to boost morale of party activists and help in strategizing the election campaign of Mr Gill, a die-hard jiyala from a lower middle class family. Members of the cabinet of Sindh, the province being ruled by the PPP, made a beeline to the corner meetings of the party candidate to give the message to the local workers that the party leadership was taking the by-poll very seriously.
Incumbent and former office-bearers from Punjab also joined the election campaign when and where needed. Ex-Punjab chapter president Qamar Zaman Kaira manned even a polling camp on Sunday issuing chits to voters containing their vote numbers and respective polling booths.
Keeping in view Mr Gill’s financial constraints, local affluent party leaders as well as from outside Punjab made generous donations to match the PML-N vis-à-vis electioneering.
This vigorous campaign paid off the party well as it increased manifold its votes making many to wonder if the PPP has put itself on the revival path in Punjab, particularly in Lahore.
There had been allegations and counter allegations of vote buying by the two main rivals and both had submitted ‘evidence’ in the form of video clips of the illegal activity to the election authority.
PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif later congratulated party leaders on their success in the NA-133. In a statement, he also thanked voters of the constituency for reposing their trust in the PML-N, and pledged to come up to their expectations on different fronts and issues.
Congratulating Mrs Malik, Mr Sharif said the voters returned the constituency to the Malik family.
PPP Punjab chapter president Raja Parvez Ashraf had earlier in the day expressed the hope that the party would win the seat despite low turnout. A Sindh minister, accompanying Mr Ashraf, however, noted that few women voters were coming out of their homes to use their right to franchise. Women wing leader and former MNA Samina Khalid Ghurki believed it was due to wedding season, as many women instead of coming to cast votes remained engaged in preparation for attending weddings that were mostly arranged on weekly holidays. A youth, clad in traditional groom’s dress, also used his right to franchise at a polling station in Johar Town. Mian Muddasir said his baraat was about the leave for the bride’s house when he decided to first cast his vote. 
The former president later congratulated Mr Ashraf by phone for increasing  PPP’s vote tally by over six-fold in the by-polls. The by-election  proved to be a turning point for the party, he said, calling it rebirth  of the party in Lahore that would lead to a change in Punjab.

2,"Pakistan, Saudi Arabia sign deals on workers’ recruitment, skills",Education minister visits live broadcasting school in Riyadh.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have signed two agreements related to workers’ recruitment and skills verification of Pakistani workforce being employed in the kingdom, said a statement issued by the Foreign Office on Sunday. 
It said the signing ceremony of the agreements took place during the visit of Minister for Education and Professional Training Shafqat Mahmood to Saudi Arabia. 
According to the FO, the agreement on workers’ recruitment will contribute to streamlining the process of export of workforce from Pakistan in diverse professions in the kingdom while safeguarding their due rights and providing comprehensive legal protection to Pakistani nationals employed in Saudi Arabia. The agreement will also help in resolving contractual disputes and taking legal recourse against recruitment offices, companies or agencies for any violation.

The agreement on skills verification will enhance export of skilled and certified Pakistani workforce to the kingdom. 
The FO statement said imparting modern skills and ensuring certification of Pakistani workforce to improve their employability abroad were key areas among Prime Minister Imran Khan’s priority sectors. “Certification for our skilled manpower will create opportunities for technical workforce in Pakistan to get internationally recognised trainings and certifications,” it added. 
The education ministry said in a press release that the agreements were signed by Shafqat Mahmood and Dr Ahmad Jabbar Al Yamni from Saudi Arabia at a ceremony at the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development of the kingdom. It was witnessed by senior officials from both countries. 
“This important cooperation between both countries has far-reaching impact for enhancing the employment opportunities for skilled Pakistani workforce by joint certification and testing by Takamol Saudi Arabia and National Vocational and Technical Training Commission (NAVTTC) Pakistan,” said the statement. 
“This step [agreements] will also safeguard the existing Pakistani work force in Saudi Arabia. It is expected that millions of Pakistani skilled workers will get gainful employment opportunities with higher earning as a result of the efforts of the government of Pakistan,” it added. 
It said that under this partnership, NAVTTC and Takamol, a subsidiary of the government of Saudi Arabia, were establishing the testing regime under the Skills Verification Programme (SVP) by exchanging the NOS (National Occupational Standards) and facilitating skill verification of candidates through competency-based assessment (theory & practical) at exam centres in Pakistan for candidates desirous of working in Saudi Arabia. 
This will enable Pakistani skill workforce to have authentic and internationally recognised joint certification by both Takamol and NAVTTC through Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) assessment. 
According to the press release, the Saudi ministry has introduced the SVP from July 2021 to regulate its labour market. After the implementation of the SVP, the skill verification has become necessary for the Pakistani workers who intend to get employment in Saudi Arabia. 
It is important to note that the largest number of Pakistani expatriate workforce is based in Saudi Arabia, contributing substantially to the country’s economy through foreign remittances. Most of the present Pakistani workforce in the kingdom fall in the category of unskilled or semiskilled labour, which means reduced remunerations and it also impacts remittances negatively, the press release said. 
Moreover, it added, in the changing scenario of labour laws and dynamics of the labour market overseas, a large number of Pakistani workforce require skills certification as presently they face non-recognition of their qualifications, skills and certification. This cooperation will help a large number of these workers and also lead to national productivity and development. 
Saudi Arabia is home to over two million Pakistani migrants and is the single largest remittance source to the South Asian nation. According to Arab News, Pakistani expatriates in the kingdom sent home $5.7 billion in July-March 2021. 
Minister visits broadcasting school
Education Minister Shafqat Mahmood also visited Saudi Broadcasting School “IEN” in Riyadh. Saudi Education Minister Hamad Bin Mohammed Al Al-Sheikh and Vice Minister for Education Dr Saad Bin Saud Al Fahid received Mr Mahmood at the school and briefed him on the state-of-the-art live facility established in 15 days to cope with learning losses during the Covid-19 pandemic. 
Mr Mahmood appreciated the IEN live broadcasting school systems, quality of content and its delivery and reach out mechanism. 
“It was decided that both IEN Saudi Arabia and TeleSchool Pakistan will engage and share experiences, processes and technologies to boost distance learning education in order to provide quality education in rural areas,” the press release said.

3,"Parliament’s security body meets today, but opposition to stay away",Cabinet member says opposition had made its participation conditional with attendance of PM Imran.,"ISLAMABAD: The government has decided to go ahead with its planned in-camera meeting of the Parliamentary Committee on National Security (PCNS) on Monday (today) despite the opposition’s decision to stay away from it.
The joint opposition in the parliament had last week announced that it would boycott the meeting of the PCNS convened by National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser on Monday for a presentation by National Security Adviser Dr Moeed Yusuf on the national security policy.
A senior member of the federal cabinet told Dawn on Sunday that the government had made some “informal contacts” with the opposition parties, asking them to reconsider their boycott decision. However, he said, the opposition had made its participation conditional with attendance of Prime Minister Imran Khan.
The speaker has invited more than 50 members, including Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, and senior officials of the ministries concerned to attend the meeting on one-point agenda — presentation on national security policy.
The decision regarding the opposition’s boycott was announced by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) information secretary Marriyum Aurangzeb in a statement, claiming that the decision had been made by the opposition parties unanimously after mutual consultations.
Ms Aurangzeb said the joint opposition had made the decision to boycott the in-camera meeting of the PCNS due to the government’s attitude of bulldozing important draft bills in the recently-held joint sitting of parliament and its “persistent authoritarian approach” on important constitutional, legal, national and security issues.
When contacted, federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Fawad Chaudhry regretted the opposition’s decision to boycott the PCNS meeting and asked it to review it. 
He said for the first time in the past seven decades a government was presenting its national security policy before the parliament. He was of the view that the opposition should not do politics on an issue related to the country’s national security.
In to a question, the minister said the NSA would present the national security policy with respect to external affairs and keeping in view the prevailing regional situation. This policy, he said, would then be presented before the federal cabinet for approval.
On the other hand, PML-N’s information secretary Marriyum Aurangzeb in a statement said the joint opposition was more committed to issues of national security than the government which was why it had participated in all such briefings in the past while Prime Minister Imran Khan didn’t even bother to attend a single such meeting.
The PML-N MNA said it was a pity that Imran Khan’s “arrogance, ego and stubbornness” had prohibited him from participating in any national consultation process whereas the opposition had never boycotted such meetings in the national interest.
Ms Aurangzeb said for the first time in seven decades, Mr Khan was the first prime minister who had not taken any issue of national security, including Kashmir, truly seriously. His absence from all meetings on Kashmir and national security till date, were a proof of this, she added. She said it was unfortunate that the prime minister had boycotted all the previous important meetings, including the one held on the issue of Covid-19.
The joint opposition in a statement last week had clarified that the opposition parties had always shown very responsible and serious attitude on all issues relating to the Constitution, national security and public importance and despite the prime minister’s absence and “his complete detachment from important national and public issues”, they had not only fully participated in the previous briefings and meetings on national security, but the top leadership of the united opposition also gave their valuable suggestions.
The opposition said it was very unfortunate that the government was adopting the policy of using parliament as a rubber stamp as important internal and external issues were not being brought and debated in the parliament.
In such circumstances, it said, such an in-camera briefing would merely pave the way for a new government “spectacle” that would have nothing to do with the performance of serious and critical issues facing the country and the people or progress towards their solution.
Furthermore, the joint opposition has agreed that the prime minister’s national security advisers were devoid of relevant information and authority on decision-making and behind-the-scene facts.
PDM Meeting
Heads of the component parties of the opposition Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) will also be meeting on Monday to prepare an anti-government protest plan with consensus.
The steering committee of the PDM met here on Sunday and prepared its recommendations about launching an anti-government protest campaign. These recommendations, according to sources in the opposition, would now be presented before the heads of the PDM component parties for final approval. 
The sources said that the committee had suggested that the PDM should organise public meetings all over the country besides giving a final call for a decisive long march towards Islamabad.

4,Law on anvil to arrest mounting debt burden,Seeks downgrading debt office reporting to finance secretary from minister.,"ISLAMABAD: Amid an increase of around 70 per cent in the country’s total public debt and liabilities over the past three years, a government bill to amend the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Act of 2005 seeks to limit the stock of government guarantees at 10pc of GDP and strengthen the public debt office to plan acquiring debt and liabilities but with a reporting downgrade.
This is part of a government bill — Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation (Amendment) Act 2021 — that came up for discussion by the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue last week but was deferred due to paucity of time.
The proposed law generally seeks to achieve three key objectives: limit the stock of government guarantees at 10pc of GDP; publish a Medium-Term National Macro-Fiscal Framework (MTMFF); and institutionalise debt management functions in a single office reporting to the finance secretary instead of the finance minister.

Seeks downgrading debt office reporting to finance secretary from minister

The draft 2021 act seeks to increase the number of directors in the Debt Policy Coordination Office (DPCO) from three to four and change its nomenclature to Debt Management Office (DMO).
The DPCO had three directors — two from the private sector and one from the public sector — and one of them was selected as its director general. The new DMO would have one director general and three directors to be hired through a “competitive process from the private or public sector”.
The DMO would have greater powers to plan a ‘debt reduction path’, raise additional loans and hold loan negotiations with international lenders in consultation with the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
The DMO or debt office would, however, administratively report to the finance secretary under the new arrangements instead of the finance minister under the existing arrangement.
In certain areas, the debt office would take over the responsibilities of the finance ministry’s external finance wing as required under a loan of the World Bank for “consolidating debt management functions into single, professionally managed and adequately resourced Debt Management Office”.
This comes at a time when Pakistan’s total debt and liabilities went beyond Rs50.48 trillion as of end-September 2021, up 69pc (or Rs20.7tr) from Rs29.88tr by end-June 2018, according to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). This amounts to 93.7pc of GDP compared to 86.3pc in July 2018.
The State Bank also reported total public debt at Rs41.47 trillion as of Sept 30, 2021 against Rs24.95tr at the end-June 2018, showing an increase of Rs16.52tr (over 66pc) in about 39 months. The total public debt now stands at 77pc of GDP, up from 66.5pc in July 2018.
Interestingly, the draft bill seeks to have an upper limit on total public debt and guarantees at 70pc of GDP with the addition of 10pc limit on the stock of guarantees. There is no change in the upper limit for the stock of public debt at 60pc of GDP as envisaged in the 2005 act.
The bar on the government to issue new guarantees or roll over the existing ones no more than 2pc of GDP in a fiscal year remains unchanged, but the proposed amendment adds the following proviso and explanation: “Provided further that the total stock of outstanding guarantees shall not exceed 10pc of estimated GDP.”
Its explanation reads: “For the purpose of this clause, each guarantee shall be valued at its risk-weighted value in accordance with a valuation methodology to be prescribed.”
The proposed law seeks to relax such bars that allow the federal government to depart from the principles of sound fiscal and debt management on the grounds of unforeseen demands on account of “national security or natural calamity as determined by the National Assembly”.
Instead, the proposed law seeks to omit the words “national security and natural calamity” and allows any unforeseen demand on the budget may result in a departure from the intended fiscal and debt reduction path to be assessed by the National Assembly.
A new proposed clause also required the finance ministry to prepare an MTMFF covering aggregate fiscal projections, particularly revenues, expenditures and primary balances of the upcoming fiscal year and the two outer years of the federal and provincial governments and other areas of the country.
This would be presented to the National Finance Commission’s monitoring committee before March 15 of every year. The MTMFF has to be published in the budget strategy papers and annual budget statements of federal, provincial and other governments as part of their budget documents.
The existing law allows a three-year term of the director general and directors extendable for another term while the new law allows three terms of three years each but more terms could be given but not consecutively.
The existing law requires the removal of the director general and other directors through an inquiry by the Federal Public Service Commission if found guilty, but the proposed law seeks their removal by the federal government through an inquiry under the prescribed manner or on performance evaluation by a committee led by the finance minister or secretary.
The DMO would have the powers to maintain a consistent and authenticated record of public debt and government guarantees without prejudice to specific responsibilities of the SBP, Economic Affairs Division, budget and external finance wings of the finance ministry or national savings as it is now but would get additional powers to outsource the record-keeping of these functions through service-level agreements.
The DMO also has an additional responsibility to prepare by law the annual debt review along with progress against the MTMFF in line with government policies with prior approval of the finance secretary.
It would prepare an annual borrowing plan with the support of relevant stakeholders, raise domestic debt through domestic government securities, bank loans or any other instrument except the Central Directorate of National Savings (CDNS).
The DMO would also formulate a process and raise domestic debt through public auctions and issue guidelines to CDNS for domestic borrowing with the approval of the finance secretary.
In addition, it would also raise extern debt through commercial bonds, banks or other instruments and provide advice to the economic affairs division in raising external loans from multilateral and bilateral lenders.
Earlier, many of these functions were in the hands of budget and external finance wings of the finance ministry.
