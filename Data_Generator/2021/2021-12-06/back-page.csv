0,Where lessening pain is a gain,"In Pakistan around 364,000 new cancer patients are detected each year, with Punjab contributing largest share of 167,000.","CANCER is rising fast across the world. In Pakistan around 364,000 new patients are detected each year, with Punjab contributing the largest share of 167,000, according to estimates — the most common type being breast cancer. The treatment centres in the country generally have limited capacities, so most of the cases are detected in advanced, incurable stages. Cancer can be cured only if detected at an early stage for which screening is vital. The West enforces breast cancer screening by law, which is lacking in Pakistan — a mammogram detects a lump in the breast half the size of a rice grain. 
When patients in an advanced, incurable stage of cancer are denied admission by hospitals, at a time when they need the most attention, and are poorly managed at home with distressing symptoms, it becomes important to lessen their pain, rehabilitate them and make them comfortable to allow them a peaceful journey. It is for this purpose that a state-of-the-art hospital-based palliative care unit has been established as part of the 27-acre Cancer Care Hospital and Research Centre off Rohi Nullah bypass in Raiwind, Lahore. 
“We bring the patients to this purpose-built model (centre) for palliative care, not to cure them but to take care of the symptoms. The objective is to make them comfortable, train their caregivers to look after them at home for that short period they have, so that they pass on peacefully among their loved ones and not in a hospital,” said director of the hospital’s Institute of Palliative Care (IPC) and founding trustee, Dr Riazur Rahman. 
As one enters the huge brick gate, the 1.8-kilometre drive to the building is lined on both sides with vast pieces of vacant land. Touted as the first in the country, the three-storey 120-bed IPC started functioning in mid-2020 with an outpatient department, followed by chemotherapy and in-patient palliative care less than two weeks ago. 
Dr Pamela Sutton, an American palliative care physician and former World Health Organisation consultant and dean of IPC, helped Dr Rahman and founder and chairman Dr Shaharyar realise this decades-long dream. She says the goal of palliative care is to improve the quality of life through pain and symptom management, and emotional, psychosocial and spiritual support. 
“Hospitals here despair with advanced cancer — nobody likes to imagine their patient is going to die. But my idea and that of many palliative care physicians is a person may not live long but if I can make them comfortable, I will give them a gift. I can’t prevent death, but if your goal is comfort and longevity then I can help.”

Every room in the palliative care unit has a separate balcony for patients to sit in and enjoy live music, drama performances for at least two days a week on a stage created outside in a garden as part of their therapeutic treatment. From beds and mattresses to machines and equipment, a hallway, ward or room, everything here has been donated by either those who lost a loved one to the disease, recovered from it or jewellers, gas companies, schools, etc. 
Nameplates put up across the building signify what has been donated by whom and in whose memory. A wing has been named after DIG Capt Ahmed Mubeen, who was martyred in a suicide bomb blast on The Mall in 2017 and whose mother donated the entire money she received as compensation. Another is named after former CJP Justice Hamoodur Rahman, also the father of IPC Director Dr Rahman. 
The palliative care unit also houses what’s claimed to be the first cancer emergency ward with seven beds and is set to start operations in January. Its OPD is visited by at least 150 people daily with seven consultants to facilitate them. Walls of the building are lined with vibrant paintings and poetic verses by Iqbal, Ghalib and Faiz. 
A few feet to the right side of this unit is ‘Sarai Bashar’, a three-storey building offering lodging and free meals to 180 patients and attendants who cannot afford to go back home and return to Raiwind frequently. 
The entire hospital is, and will keep, running primarily on charity collected through the efforts of renowned oncologist Dr Shaharyar to provide cancer treatment and facilities for free, regardless of one’s background, nationality, age, stage of disease. Not a single penny is charged from anyone for any facility or treatment, though the well-to-do patients could make any donation.

Oncologist Dr Shaharyar, who retired from the King Edward Medical University, Mayo Hospital, a few years ago, came up with the idea of a free cancer hospital after he witnessed first-hand the misery of patients at Mayo, who lacked adequate facilities and couldn’t afford expensive treatment. “Five years before my retirement in 2014, I started struggling with Punjab governments of both Pervez Elahi and then Shehbaz Sharif, but nobody listened to me. Then I started gathering funds from my colleagues and friends and started this project on my own in 2015. We started with the first mass mammography screening programme and carried out more than 42,000 tests in remote areas,” he told Dawn. 
While separate blocks for breast cancer and oncology are in the pipeline, the “backbone of the hospital”, its radiation block, was the first to be inaugurated at the facility in June 2019 and now treats around 150 patients a day in seven bunkers equipped with the latest machinery. “Radiation is a double-edged weapon: it can cure as well as cause cancer. So we have installed the machines inside bunkers to avoid leakage of radiation. If radiation is applied to a patient in the early stage then the cancer is 100 per cent curable, but in the last stages it provides relief as a pain killer. We are the largest radiation block in Pakistan and, we claim, the largest in Asia. Each of our bunkers with 4.5- to 8-foot-thick walls costs Rs35 to 50 million and all seven were constructed in a record eight months,” says Prof Areesha Zaman, the director of medical radiation at the hospital. 
Prof Zaman sees hardly any effort at the government level to facilitate cancer patients. All the radiation machines in public hospitals are out of order, the hospitals don’t admit patients in advanced stages of the disease or charge them huge amounts that discourages patients, she says. 
The incidence of breast cancer is spreading fast from old to younger people. “In my four decades of experience, I’ve realised that stress is the major reason for breast cancer among women caused by either socio-eco problems or diet. So one should lead a positive life with a healthy lifestyle, and that’s true for all countries,” she suggests.

1,Campaign for LG polls in KP’s 17 districts gains momentum,"Around 19,282 candidates are contesting for seats of general councillors at 2,359 village councils and neighbourhood councils.","PESHAWAR: The campaign for the upcoming local bodies polls has gathered momentum in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, with publicity materials dotted around 17 districts of the province where the first phase of polls is set to be held on Dec 19.
As the elections approach, the candidates — especially those running for village councils and neighbourhood councils (VCNCs) — have bent all their efforts to reach as many voters as possible.
Nasir Khan, a local leader of the Awami National Party, said the election campaign had been dominated by the candidates contesting for VCNCs, the lowest tier of the local government system, as compared to those running for tehsil councils. 
At the VCNC level, a candidate was contesting almost from each street, which had made the campaign interesting and much competitive, he said.
He said a tough contest was expected on three general seats of each VCNC and each seat of youth, women, peasants, and the minority.
In the first phase of elections, polling will be held on Dec 19 for two tiers of the local bodies, while the elections will take place in the remaining 18 districts on Jan 16, 2022. 
A total of 19,282 candidates are contesting for the seats of general councillors at 2,359 VCNCs, while the number of women candidates is 3,905 for the same number of VCNCs. 
Similarly, 7,513 candidates are running for peasant/worker seats, 290 for the youth, and 282 for the minority. Besides, 689 candidates are contesting for the seats of mayor or chairman of 63 tehsil councils of KP’s 17 districts. 
The districts where elections will be held on Dec 19 are Buner, Bajaur, Swabi, Pesha­war, Nowshera, Kohat, Kar­ak, Dera Ismail Khan, Bannu, Tank, Haripur, Khyber, Mohmand, Chars­adda, Mardan, Hangu and Lakki Marwat.
The cities and rural areas are covered with hoardings, banners and posters with pictures of the candidates, their leaders and supporters.
“Besides door-to-door canvassing, we are also holding corner meetings,” Nowsher­wan Khan, a general councillor candidate from Ghari Qamardin-I neighbourhood council, told Dawn.
Mr Khan, who is contesting the election as an independent, said that besides other electoral publicity mate­rials, he and his supporters had also been using social media for the campaign.
The use of social media, especially Facebook, was playing an important role in the election campaign at the VCNC level as most voters were connected to each other on social networking sites, he said.
“We have created WhatsApp groups where we upload all campaign-related activities and ask the members to share the messages with their friends and also suggest improvements,” said Ismail Khan, a supporter of a general councillor candidate from Hazarkhwani-II neighbourhood.

2,13 civilians killed in Nagaland military ambush,A protester is shot dead as demonstrators vandalise military camp,"NEW DELHI: Indian forces apologised on Sunday for an ambush in the volatile state of Nagaland that killed 14 people, including 13 civilians, the previous day.
Reports quoted the security forces as saying it was a case of “mistaken identity”, and stressed the situation continued to be tense in Nagaland’s Mon district on Sunday.  
The authorities said that a large crowd of angry villagers gathered in Mon town and marched to the Assam Rifles camp, “engaging in vandalism”. The security forces opened fire, leading to the death of one more civilian.
“They engaged in vandalism, destruction and set fire to some buildings. The security forces opened fire, which led to the death of one civilian. One more was injured,” Abhijit Sinha, a home ministry official, told The Indian Express. He added that the situation was under control and prohibitory orders had been imposed in Mon town.

A protester is shot dead as demonstrators vandalise military camp

In a statement on Sunday morning, the Assam Rifles said that “based on credible intelligence of likely movement of insurgents, a specific operation was planned to be conducted in the area of Tiru, Mon District, Nagaland”. 
Without divulging details on the number of casualties or the units involved, the statement said “the incident and its aftermath is deeply regretted”.
“The cause of the unfortunate loss of lives is being investigated by a court of inquiry at the highest level and appropriate action will be taken as per the course of law,” it said, adding that the “security forces have suffered severe injuries in the operation, including one soldier who succumbed to his injuries”.
In a tweet on Sunday, India’s Home Minister Amit Shah promised justice to the families of those killed. “Anguished over an unfortunate incident in Nagaland’s Oting, Mon. I express my deepest condolences to the families of those who have lost their lives. A high-level SIT constituted by the State govt will thoroughly probe this incident to ensure justice to the bereaved families,” Shah tweeted. 
Assam Rifles comes under the ambit of the federal home ministry.
As per local reports, security forces mistook the victims to be members of the Yung Aung faction of a proscribed outfit, National Socialist Council of Nagaland (K). “It seems like a botched-up ambush,” the Express quoted a Nagaland government official as saying.
According to sources in Oting, a few local boys were returning to their village after working in a mine on Saturday evening when their vehicle was allegedly fired upon by security personnel. “They died on the spot,” the Press trust of India said, adding that the security forces were conducting an operation in the area after receiving input on the movement of militants of the Yung Aung faction.
Sources in the security forces asserted that it was a case of mistaken identity. An official said that based on certain input, the forces were waiting for people in a specific Bolero car around 5.30pm on Saturday. It was already dark when they spotted a similar Bolero and launched an operation, the official said.
In the operation and the clashes that ensued with the security forces later, 13 civilians were killed.

3,Taliban flayed over ‘summary killings’ of ex-security personnel,WASHINGTON: The United States on Saturday led a group of Western nations and allies in condemnation of the Taliban...,"WASHINGTON: The United States on Saturday led a group of Western nations and allies in condemnation of the Taliban over the “summary killings” of former members of the Afghan security forces reported by rights groups, demanding quick investigations. 
“We are deeply concerned by reports of summary killings and enforced disappearances of former members of the Afghan security forces as documented by Human Rights Watch and others,” read a statement by the United States, the European Union, Australia, Britain, Japan and others, which was released by the State Department. 
“We underline that the alleged actions constitute serious human rights abuses and contradict the Taliban’s announced amnesty,” the group of nations said, as it called on Afghanistan’s new rulers to ensure the amnesty is enforced and “upheld across the country and throughout their ranks”. 
Early this week Human Rights Watch (HRW) released a report that it says documents the summary execution or enforced disappearance of 47 former members of the Afghan National Security Forces, other military personnel, police and intelligence agents “who had surrendered to or were apprehended by Taliban forces” from mid-August through October. 
“Reported cases must be investigated promptly and in a transparent manner, those responsible must be held accountable, and these steps must be clearly publicised as an immediate deterrent to further killings and disappearances,” the countries — which include Canada, New Zealand, Romania, Ukraine and several European nations — said in their statement. 
“We will continue to measure the Taliban by their actions.” 
The Taliban took power in Afghanistan in August as the US-backed government in Kabul and the country’s military collapsed. Their return to power came some 20 years after they were driven out by US forces who ended a rule that earned opprobrium for its harsh treatment of women and failure to uphold human rights. 
Today’s Taliban leaders, keen to gain international respectability, have pledged their regime will be different.
But the new government has continued to carry out violent punishments, and the United Nations has expressed concern about “credible allegations” that the Taliban have carried out reprisal killings since their victory. 
In its report, HRW said Taliban leaders have directed surrendering security forces to register with authorities in order to be screened for ties to certain military or special forces units, and to receive a letter guaranteeing their safety. 
“However, the Taliban have used these screenings to detain and summarily execute or forcibly disappear individuals within days of their registration, leaving their bodies for their relatives or communities to find,” HRW said.

4,"Eruption of Indonesian volcano leaves 14 dead, dozens injured","Around 1,300 people have been evacuated, while nine people remain unaccounted for.","SUMBERWULUH: The eruption of Semeru volcano has killed at least 14 people and injured dozens on Java island, Indonesia’s disaster agency said on Sunday, as rescue teams searched for victims under layers of ash, sometimes digging with their bare hands. 
Semeru, the tallest mountain on Java, threw up towers of ash and hot clouds on Saturday that blanketed nearby villages in East Java province and sent people fleeing in panic. 
The eruption destroyed buildings and severed a strategic bridge connecting two areas in the nearby district of Lumajang with the city of Malang, authorities said. 
A BNPB official said in a news conference late on Sunday that 14 people had been killed, nine of whom have been identified, and 56 people suffered injuries, most of them burns. 
Around 1,300 people have been evacuated, while nine people remain unaccounted for, BNPB said. 
Taufiq Ismail Marzuqi, a resident in the district of Lumajang who had volunteered to help, said that rescue efforts were “very dire” because of the severed bridge and volunteers lacking experience. 
In a video he recorded, police and military officials tried to excavate bodies with their bare hands. 
Rescuers in the village of Curah Kobokan, also in Lumajang, found the body of a mother still holding her dead baby, the state news agency Antara reported. 
A witness in the Sumberwuluh area said homes and vehicles were almost completely submerged by thick, grey ash, fallen trees blocked roads and a cow which villagers had been unable to rescue lay by the roadside. 
Hosniya, a 31-year-old local resident who was evacuated with her family, said that the eruption was very sudden. “At first, I thought it was a bomb explosive... suddenly it was all dark, like it was going to destroy the Earth,” she said. 
Hosniya and her family fled, unable to take anything with them other than their official papers. 
Heavy rain is expected for the next three days, which could complicate evacuation efforts, a meteorological agency official said late on Sunday. 
Rock debris and hot volcanic sediment were already limiting movement, local rescuers said. 
BNPB will rebuild the wrecked homes, and heavy equipment, including excavators and bulldozers, is being deployed, its chief said. 
The agency also said that 10 people trapped in sand mines by the eruption had been evacuated to safety. 
Semeru, which according to volcano experts has been in an eruptive phase since 2014, had started emitting hot clouds and lava flows recently, prompting the authorities to issue warnings for people not to go near it from Wednesday. 
Indonesia’s transportation ministry said on Sunday the eruption had not caused any disruption to flights, though pilots have been alerted to watch out for the ash-fall. 
Semeru, more than 3,600 metres high, is one of Indonesia’s nearly 130 active volcanoes. 
Indonesia straddles the “Pacific Ring of Fire”, a highly seismically active zone, where different plates on the Earth’s crust meet and create a large number of earthquakes and volcanoes. 
While many Indonesian volcanoes show high levels of continued activity, eruptions can be years apart. In 2010, an eruption of the Merapi volcano on Java island killed over 350 people and displaced 400,000.
