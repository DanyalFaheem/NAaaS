0,MQM-P invites PML-N to multiparty conference,MPC being held on 11th in protest against passage of Sindh local government bill,"KARACHI: The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan on Sunday extended an invitation to the main opposition party Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz for its multiparty conference (MPC) to be held on December 11 against the passage of the controversial Sindh Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2021. 
Since the MQM-P is an important coalition partner of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf-led government at the Centre, the rare contact between the two parties is being seen as an attempt by the former to normalise its relations with the PML-N. 
A delegation of the MQM-P, led by its senior deputy convener Amir Khan, visited the PML-N House at Karsaz, met senior leaders Miftah Ismail, former Sindh governor Mohammad Zubair and others and informed them about the reasons for organising the MPC. 
PML-N leader Nasiruddin Mehmood told Dawn that his party had accepted the invitation and would attend the MPC. He said that when a party leader found out that the invitation for the event contained the name of PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif, he in a lighter vein informed them that Mr Sharif was in London and he could attend the moot via a video link only if the MQM leadership wanted him to speak at their event. 

MPC being held on 11th in protest against passage of Sindh local government bill 

Mr Mehmood, who is general secretary of the PML-N’s Karachi chapter, said the visiting delegation did not reject the proposal and replied that “they will discuss the issue within the party and get back to us”. 
He said the MQM-P delegation discussed with the PML-N their reservations with the ruling PTI and the problems being faced by the people of urban areas due to the policies of the Pakistan Peoples Party as well as the new LG bill. 
“Both parties are in agreement that the next general elections must be held in a transparent and impartial manner,” the PML-N leader said. 
Asked whether the PML-N would share a platform with the rival PTI, which is also in the opposition in Sindh and had given its consent to attend the MPC, Mr Mehmood replied in the affirmative, saying his party believed in democratic norms. 
During the meeting, he added, PML-N’s Sindh chapter secretary general Miftah Ismail said that his party was in favour of setting up of provincial finance commissions on the pattern of the National Finance Commission so that the provinces could release funds at the division level under an agreed formula. 
Mohammad Zubair said Prime Minister Imran Khan always talked about devolution of powers to the grassroots level when he was in opposition, but he took a U-turn on this when he came to power. 
Later, leaders of the two parties talked to the media. 
MQM-P leader Amir Khan said the PPP was using its “fake” majority in the Sindh Assembly to get controversial laws, specially the new LG bill, passed without consulting stakeholders. 
Miftah Ismail, who is also a former finance minister, said the PPP had snatched the powers of the local government organisations to deprive the people of their legitimate rights. 
The MQM-P is holding the MPC to discuss injustices against urban areas of Sindh and the passage of the “black law” of local government by the PPP.

2,"CPEC success depends on locals’ participation, seminar told",QUETTA: Speakers at a seminar have called for taking the people of Balochistan and Gwadar into confidence for the...,"QUETTA: Speakers at a seminar have called for taking the people of Balochistan and Gwadar into confidence for the success of Gwadar Port and CPEC-related projects in the province. 
The seminar was organised on Sunday by Friedrich Ebert Stiftung, a non-profit German foundation, on the role of lawmakers in investment and promotion of CPEC-related industrialisation projects in Gwadar. The foundation is committed to advancement and promotion of socio-political and economic development across the world. 
Those who spoke on the occasion included Chairman of the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on CPEC Arbab Sher Ali, NA Deputy Speaker Qasim Suri, provincial minister Zahoor Buledi and MNA Aslam Bhootani. 
Speaking on the occasion, Sher Ali said the main purpose of his visit to Balochistan was to review progress on CPEC-related development projects and get an input from different people and experts to boost investment in Gwadar. 
He said that members of the committee noted that without involving the people of Gwadar and other areas of Balochistan, CPEC-related mega projects could not progress in the area. 
He said the people of Gwadar and Makran had apprehensions that they would not benefit from CPEC-related projects and beneficiaries of these mega projects would be other people. 
“The people of Gwadar are facing some basic problems. These include shortage of drinking water, power outages and illegal fishing by foreign boats,” Sher Ali said, adding that these issues must the resolved and the local people should be involved in the development process of Balochistan.
He said the other main issue was provision of security as without ensuring security no foreign investors would come to Balochistan to invest in the province and even investors from the country would not come to the area for the purpose. 
National Assembly Deputy Speaker Qasim Suri said the government was making serious efforts for developing Gwadar and other areas of Balochistan. 
He said that industrial zones were being established in Bostan and other areas which would help investors come to the area and invest in different economic sectors in the province.
Member of the Standing Committee on CPEC Muhammad Aslam Bhootani said the people of some areas of Balochistan had been deprived of gas since 1952 when gas reserves were discovered in Sui.

5,"PMA wants exam depts, academicians part of MDCAT firm’s hiring process","Exam fee between Rs500 and Rs1,000 proposed.","• PMC’s tailor-made tender criticised
• Exam fee between Rs500 and Rs1,000 proposed 
ISLAMABAD: Criticising the Pakistan Medical Commission (PMC) for floating a “tailor-made” tender to hire a company for conducting the Medical and Dental Colleges Admission Test (MDCAT), the Pakistan Medical Associa­tion (PMA), a representative body of the medical fraternity, has suggested that examination departments and academicians of renowned universities should be involved in the hiring of a testing company.
Moreover, the association has suggested that the exam fee should be between Rs500 and Rs1,000 as around 200,000 students take the test, which is mandatory for getting admission to medical and dental colleges at the same time.
It is worth mentioning here that a number of cases are being heard in courts that the SOAR Testing and Evaluation Platform (SMC-PVT) Limited (TEPS), which had a joint venture (JV) with the PMC and conducted MDCAT across the country as well as out of Pakistan in six cities in September this year, was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) after the date of filing of bids for MDCAT tender and also lacked NTN number. 
Last month the PMC had cancelled the 10-year joint venture agreement with TEPS and floated a tender, calling on companies to file technical and financial proposal bids by Dec 9.
According to the tender document, available with Dawn, the duration of the contract would initially be for five years and extendable for another five years. 
The MDCAT exam must be conducted in an offline mode with no dependency on internet to avoid any connectivity issue. 
The question bank will be provided by the PMC but it will be the responsibility of the bidder to provide paper setting software to generate examination papers based on the rules and indexing determined by the PMC. 
The lead bidder should be a company/firm incorporated with the SECP and have NTN, Sales Tax Number and be on active taxpayer list of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).
However, the new PMC tender document contains some conditions which cannot be achieved or met by any other testing company in Pakistan except the TEPS which has got experience after a joint venture with the PMC.
In order to qualify, the bidders must achieve a minimum of 70 per cent score in technical evaluation, and marks below 50pc in any of the six categories will disqualify the bidder. It states that the company should have conducted the computer-based exam locally at more than 20 locations and internationally at over five locations simultaneously within a period of 30 days. 
Only two marks will be awarded to bidders who held exams of 10,000 students and 15 marks to those firms that conducted the test of 150,000 students.
Pakistan Medical Association Punjab President retired Col Dr Ghulam Shabir, while talking to Dawn, said the TEPS was going to be the only eligible company which had completed at least one similar mandatory big project, and would fulfil all other tailor-made specific criteria of the new tender.
“The fact is that the Lahore High Court has been hearing a case in this regard due to which the PMC cancelled the 10-year contract with the company. Moreover, the firm’s representative has never appeared in the hearings due to which it strengthens our doubt that it is a shadow company and PMC has been making efforts to award the contract to it again,” he claimed. 
Last year, Mr Shabir said, the PMC uploaded on its website that in Pakistan there was no company which had the experience of holding such a test and that was why an agreement was made with a company. “Now a tailor-made tender has been prepared to award the contract to the same company,” he alleged. 
It is worth mentioning here that last week, the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Health, chaired by MNA Khalid Hussain Magsi, also discussed the issue and expressed annoyance over the absence of both the PMC president and vice president. Members refused to get a briefing from Member Examination PMC retired Brig Nasir Rafique and warned that they may move a privilege motion against the PMC president and vice president.    
Talking to Dawn, PMA general secretary Dr Qaiser Sajjad said the examination departments of well-reputed universities should be involved in hiring of companies for the test.
“Moreover, the fee of the test, which was Rs6,000 during the last test, should be between Rs500 and Rs1,000 as around 200,000 students appear in exam. Academicians should also be involved in the process,” Dr Sajjad said.
The PMC media coordinator was contacted for official version of the commission but he failed to get any response from the top management.

6,Fawad praises opposition for condemning Sialkot incident,The information minister said the nation wanted to tackle extremism.,"ISLAMABAD: Despite political differences with mainstream opposition parties, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry on Sunday hailed the reaction of opposition parties to the lynching of Sri Lankan factory manager Priyantha Kumara in Sialkot and said the nation wanted to tackle extremism.
The minister criticised the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s (PTI) leader Senator Ejaz Ahmed Chaudhry for presenting flowers to Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) chief Saad Hussain Rizvi on his release from jail in November and termed his move “absurd”.
“The way Ahsan Iqbal and Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar responded to Maulana Fazlur Rahman’s statement reflects that the leaderships of all the political parties realise the severity of the situation and want to cope with [extremism],” the minister said in a joint press conference with Sports Minister Fehmida Mirza and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Youth Affairs, Usman Dar, in which they announced launching of what they called “the country’s biggest sports gala — Kamyab Jawan Sports Drive from Monday (today). 

Terms PTI senator’s act of meeting TLP chief ‘absurd’

Maulana Rehman, who is chief of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) — a cluster of mainstream opposition parties bent upon toppling the government — had said in his statement on Tweeter that the government was responsible for the Sialkot-like incident. “If the state does not take action against the ones accused of blasphemy then such incidents will happen,” he said. 
However, leaders of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) denounced Maulana Rehman’s statement on the lynching. 
Fawad Chaudhry said the Sialkot incident had bowed down the whole nation’s head, but he expressed satisfaction that the country which had passed through a long era of dictatorship, had a vibrant leadership in all political parties. 
The minister said Pakistan was a progressive country with strong institutions and democratic values. “No country has witnessed restoration of democracy in the way as Pakistan after passing from long eras of dictatorship,” he added.
He said extremism was not the issue of any single party, but the concern of all parties as the political process and democracy could only flourish in the country when there was law and order.
About the mob lynching of the Sri Lankan factory manager, the minister said the way Pakistani nation has shown its reaction over this incident reflect that they were united in their stance against such extremist and heinous act and wanted to cope with it.
He said that was the second such incident after the attack on Army Public School on which the whole nation was grieved, ashamed and showed unity against extremism.
“The reaction of our nation shows that except [for a] few thousands or lakhs of such extremist people, majority of the people among 220 million populations are tolerant citizens and this is the ray of hope for us to move forward,” he said.
He said that Prime Minister Imran Khan conveyed his grief and pain over this sad incident while talking to the Sri Lankan President and also issued a message after the incident.
The minister said the crowd involved in this incident was between the ages of 15-25 and emphasised on engaging youth in constructive and healthy activities like sports.
The minister congratulated Usman Dar and Fehmida Mirza for the launch of this much needed sports drive.
Sports Minister Fehmida Mirza said she had received telephone calls of many families of overseas Pakistanis who wanted to extend financial assistant to the bereaved family of Priyantha Kumara.
Violent protests
Earlier, Fawad Chaudhry has criticised PTI Senator Ejaz Ahmed Chaudhry’s for presenting flowers to TLP chief Saad Hussain Rizvi on his release from jail in November and termed the senator’s action absurd.
Speaking at a private TV talk show on Saturday about the lynching of the Sri Lankan factory manager over blasphemy allegations, he said: “I think the manner in which Ejaz Chaudhry Sahib [met] the TLP [leadership] was an absurd act. Why didn’t [he] visit the homes of the policemen who were martyred,” he questioned?
The TLP was linked to the gory Sialkot incident by users on social media, but the group distanced itself from the lynching and condemned it.
Some government leaders had reportedly embraced the TLP despite its violent protests in October leaving a number of policemen martyred in Punjab.
Senator Ejaz had met TLP chief Rizvi last month as a “gesture of goodwill” and to congratulate him on his release from jail. Pictures of Senator Ejaz hugging and presenting a bouquet to Mr Rizvi were widely shared on social media.
The meeting had come after the TLP and the federal government reached an agreement on October 31 after many rounds of talks and two weeks of clashes which left seven policemen and a number of TLP workers dead. The agreement was kept secret, but leaked information suggested consensus on removing the party from the list of banned organisations, Rizvi’s release and setting TLP workers free that were held under various charges, including anti-terrorism.
A week later, on November 7, the federal cabinet decided to revoke the declaration putting the TLP on the list of “proscribed” organisations under the country’s anti-terrorism law.
Speaking about the Sialkot lynching, the minister said the issue of extremism had to be tackled by all stakeholders and emphasised that the country’s education system — especially from grades 6 to 13 — needed to undergo a review. He also attributed the failure in tackling the problem to widespread divisions among political parties.
Asked whether the Kumara’s ghastly murder would be the “turning point” in the Pakistan’s fight against extremism, the information minister said the problem would not end by simply hanging or imprisoning the culprits involved in the lynching.
Fawad Chaudhry acknowledged that the subject was quite “complex” and said the federal and the provincial governments will have to implement the code of conduct given in the National Action Plan and review the action plan to fill the gaps in its execution.

8,YDA to ramp up efforts for doctors held in Balochistan,QUETTA: Young doctors from across the country have condemned the arrest of 19 doctors who were detained last week ...,"QUETTA: Young doctors from across the country have condemned the arrest of 19 doctors who were detained last week for staging a sit-in and blocking roads linking the city’s Red Zone with other areas. 
Speaking at a joint press conference on Saturday, Young Doctors Association’s (YDA) leaders lamented that the arrested doctors had not been released despite the passage of one week. 
YDA members, along with paramedical and nursing staff associations, had been staging a protest sit-in near the Red Zone, blocking all roads leading to the governor and the chief minister houses and the Balochistan Civil Secretariat for acceptance of their demands.
The doctors have been demanding improvement in government hospitals’ conditions, provision of medicines for patients, installation of modern medical equipment in hospitals and security of doctors and paramedical staff.
During Saturday’s press conference, YDA leaders said the association’s general body would meet on Monday (tomorrow) in which important decisions would be taken about the next course of action. “We may consider the chief minister’s resignation,” they said.
The press conference was addressed by YDA leaders from Punjab, Sindh, Gilgit-Baltistan and Islamabad. “The government considered our demands justified but it isn’t ready to implement them which forced young doctors to protest and boycott,” they said. 
YDA Chairman Dr Hafeez Mandokhail said the government and the opposition had failed to address the situation. “People are suffering but the rulers have closed their eyes and ears,” he said. “We are considering all options, including resignations, protests and shutting down the emergency.”
Dr Mudassar Nawaz, the president of YDA’s Punjab chapter, said they would protest the arrests by wearing black armbands.
On the occasion, the YDA leaders vowed that they would not hold talks with anyone until the arrested doctors were released. They said they would keep protesting for their colleagues and whatever action plan is decided on Monday, they would stand by YDA Pakistan and support its cause.
