0,Remains of Sri Lankan national repatriated,26 suspects remanded in police custody for 15 days,"LAHORE/NAROWAL: The remains of Sri Lankan national Priyantha Kumara were repatriated to Colombo from Allama Iqbal International Airport on Monday. 
Mr Kumara, a senior manager in a factory in Sialkot, was tortured to death on Friday by hundreds of protesters, including the factory employees, and his body later burnt over allegations of blasphemy. 
A case was registered against 900 workers of Rajco Industries on the complaint of Uggoki Station House Officer Armaghan Maqt under Sections 302, 297, 201, 427, 431, 157, 149 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and Sections 7 and 11WW of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA). 
Mr Kumara’s remains were first transported to Lahore from Sialkot for further repatriation to Sri Lanka after conducting forensic and medical examinations. 

26 suspects remanded in police custody for 15 days

The body was taken to the Lahore airport in an ambulance where Punjab Minister for Minority Affairs Ejaz Alam Augustine received it and dispatched it via a Sri Lankan Airlines flight with state honours. Other officials present on the occasion were Special Representative to the Prime Minister on Religious Harmony Hafiz Tahir Ashrafi, Honorary Consul General of Sri Lanka Yasin Joya and representatives of the home department and Sri Lankan High Commission. 
Speaking to reporters at the airport, Mr Ashrafi said the whole nation would have to unite to eradicate extremism the way it had eliminated terrorism from the country. “Today is a day of grief but we promise that the killers of Priyantha Kumara will be brought to justice,” he claimed. 
The Sri Lankan High Commission in Pakistan also tweeted: “Remains of Diyawadanage Don Priyantha Kumara killed by a mob in Sialkot Pakistan was transferred from Lahore to Colombo by SriLankan Airlines this afternoon.” 
Meanwhile, an anti-terrorism court has remanded 26 suspects in the case of Mr Kumara’s murder in police custody for 15 days. District police produced the suspects before the Gujranwala anti-terrorism court of judge Natasha Naseem Supra on Monday for allegedly torturing and killing Sri Lankan national Kumara on charges of blasphemy. 
Police requested the court for a 15-day physical remand of the suspects that was granted. The judge ordered that the suspects be presented in court again on December 21. 
The suspects were brought to the court under tight security of the police, Elite Force and plainclothes personnel. 
Sialkot police are also conducting raids to arrest the remaining suspects. According to sources, police are trying to arrest 298 suspects with the help of CCTV footage from the garment factory’s cameras and attendance records of workers. They are also showing videos of the incident to the factory supervisor and unit in-charge to identify the suspects. 
According to the sources, police also arrested the workers of Rajco Industries from other districts, including Daska, Pasrur, Sambrial, Narowal, Gujrat and Lodhran, where they had fled after the incident to evade arrest. 
Talking to Dawn, PML-N MPA Sardar Ramesh Singh Arora said the killing of the Sri Lankan national was reprehensible, adding that there was a constitution and law in Pakistan to deal with such incidents. “If a person commits blasphemy, he should be severely punished according to the law,” he said, adding that people should not take the law into their own hands. 
Ratan Lal Arya, general secretary of the Pak Dharmastan Committee, said the violent killing of Mr Kumara in Sialkot was an attempt to tarnish Pakistan’s image in the world. No religion condones killing of another person but teaches humanity, he added.

1,IHC dismisses plea seeking travel ban on GB’s former chief judge,Rejects another petition by applicant in which he sought to become a party in a contempt of court case against Rana Shamim.,"ISLAMABAD: The Isla­m­abad High Court (IHC) on Monday dismissed a petition seeking placement of former chief justice of Gilgit-Baltistan Rana Mohammad Shamim’s name on the Exit Control List (ECL).  
The high court also rejected another petition by the applicant in which he sought to become a party in a contempt of court case against Mr Shamim. 
The applicant, Supreme Court advocate Rai Mo­­h­am­mad Nawaz Kharal, filed two petitions. In one petition, he requested for becoming a party in the ongoing contempt of court proceedings against Mr Shamim, Jang Group’s chief editor Mir Shakeel-ur-Rehman and senior journalists Ansar Abbasi and Aamir Ghauri. 
In another petition, Mr Kharal sought a court directive for the federal government to place Mr Shamim’s name on the ECL. 
Justice Shamim claimed in his Nov 16 affidavit that former chief justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar had asked an IHC judge to delay grant of bail to PML-N sup­remo Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz until after the 2018 general elections. 
Advocate Kharal appea­r­­ed in person before IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah. 
Justice Minallah noted that the nature of the proceedings under Article 204 of the Constitution, read with the Contempt of Court Ordinance 2003, were confined to matters between the court and the alleged contemnor(s). 
“As a corollary, a person other than an alleged contemnor cannot claim to be a necessary party to contempt proceedings. There is no provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), 1898 pari materia [in a similar case] to the provisions contained in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 regarding impleadment of a necessary or interested party,” Justice Minallah pointed out.

2,"HR minister condemns Sialkot incident, demands NAP enforcement",Rashid vows tough action against elements involved in lynching,"ISLAMABAD: Federal Minister for Human Rights Minister Dr Shireen Mazari, while condemning the Sialkot lynching incident, on Monday called for proper implementation of the National Action Plan (NAP) as Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid pledged to take tough action against all those involved in the lynching of the Sri Lankan citizen. 
Speaking to the media, Dr Mazari said the government would review NAP to know why and where the plan was not being implemented. 
She demanded strict action against all those elements who distorted the image of Islam, adding that torturing someone and putting the body of a victim on fire were against humanity. 
“This killing is not acceptable. We condemn it strongly and now time has come to take action,” she said. 

Rashid vows tough action against elements involved in lynching

Dr Mazari acknowledged that extremism was increasing in society, adding that time had come to take steps to stop this monster from spreading. 
She said that NAP had been made after the Army Public School (APS) incident, but it could not be fully enforced till now. 
“It is our duty to implement NAP strictly to discourage extremism and violence,” she said, adding that criminal laws were being amended and the government would complete the task in a month. 
She said that changes in the laws were part of NAP and this exercise should have been done years ago, but it was not done.
“Pakistan is a Muslim country and Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance, but what has happened in Sialkot is not acceptable,” Dr Mazari said. 
She said that the Sialkot lynching of the Sri Lankan citizen was not the first incident as earlier Mashal Khan case had taken place and “two of our Christian community members were burnt. So it’s now time to take strict action”. 
The minister urged different political parties within the Pakistan Democratic Movement to distance themselves from PDM chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman’s statement on the Sialkot incident. 
She defended the statement of Defence Minister Pervez Khattak, saying the latter had already clarified his position on the issue on Twitter. 
In reply to a question about the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan’s (TLP) hardline stance on the issue of blasphemy laws, Dr Mazari said the federal cabinet would hold a discussion on the matter. 
The TLP was linked to the Sialkot lynching incident on social media, but the party has distanced itself from the incident. 
Meanwhile, Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed visited the Sri Lankan High Commission in Islamabad and expressed his deep sorrow and grief over the killing of Priyantha Kumara. 
The minister met High Commissioner Vice Admiral Mohan Wijewickrama and told him that every Pakistani was in a state of shock and sorrow over the death of the Sri Lankan citizen. 
He expressed condolences to the victim’s family and the people of Sri Lanka on behalf the people and government of Pakistan over the tragic death of Priyantha Kumara. 
The interior minister said that all those involved in the incident would be brought to justice. 
According to interior ministry, the Sri Lankan high commissioner expressed satisfaction over the progress in the case and said that both countries had cordial relations which would not be affected by the Sialkot incident.

5,"Legislature cannot undo court judgement, observes SC judge","Bench takes up hearing of petitions seeking review of Aug 17 judgement rendering almost 17,000 government employees jobless.","ISLAMABAD: The legislature cannot undo a court judgement on merit, but it can nullify the effects of the judgement, emphasised Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah of the Supreme Court on Monday. 
“The government cannot bring an individual back to service when the Supreme Court in a case had already held that the individual had been terminated rightly,” Justice Shah observed during the hearing of a set of petitions seeking review of the Aug 17 judgement rendering almost 17,000 government employees jobless. 
Justice Mansoor Ali Shah was a member of a five-judge bench, headed by Justice Umar Ata Bandial, which took up the petitions. 
The courts cannot be approached a second time seeking reversal of a judgement that upheld the employees’ termination orders, the judge added in his observations. 
“We are unable to understand the scheme why the parliament made such a law of reinstating the government employees when each of the cases of the terminated employees was already discussed and decided at different forums.” 
The courtroom No 1, seized with a number of review petitions, was packed with sacked employees while a large number of them stood outside the Supreme Court premises. 
On the eve of his retirement, Justice Mushir Alam had on Aug 17 declared as illegal and unconstitutional a PPP-era law, known as the Sacked Em­­p­loyees (Reinstatement) Ordi­nance Act 2010 (SERA), under which a number of people were employed or promoted. 
Barrister Aitzaz Ahsan, representing officers of the Intelligence Bureau (IB), argued that if the Supreme Court’s judgement was set aside, many sacked employees would have to be reinstated. 
The counsel recalled that the judgement which upheld the termination of some of the IB officers had been reviewed. But Justice Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed reminded him that the judgement was never reviewed. Although certain remarks were expunged, the termination was never set aside. 
Aitzaz Ahsan contended that the caretaker government, which issued the termination orders, had no authority to do so. 
“Had I been dismissed from service by Halaku Khan, will it be legal,” the counsel wondered, but Justice Aminuddin Khan observed that “you would challenge it”. 
Mr Ahsan argued that the Aug 17 judgement was “entirely misconceived”. 
Justice Shah wanted to know “what was so special about the employees who were appointed from 1993 to 1996”.  
“What will be the status of a law which sanctions five advance increments for government employees serving in Islamabad, but excludes all others from this benefit.” 
Justice Qazi Amin reminded Aitzaz Ahsan that he was the interior minister when these employees were appointed, adding that the Intelligence Bureau followed a rigorous recruitment process, but apparently did not adhere to it in the case under consideration. 
Mr Ahsan denied that the procedure was not followed and pointed out that appointments in the IB were outside the purview of the Federal Public Service Commission. 
Parliament and judicial scrutiny Iftikhar Gillani, who represents a group of school teachers in the petition, cited a number of judgements by the apex court itself to establish that it cannot examine a law made by parliament. 
But Justice Bandial observed that in case of violation of fundamental rights, the judiciary had an obligation to intervene. 
Iftikhar Gillani, however, contended that the Supreme Court had no jurisdiction to question the legislature’s wisdom or motive even if a law was promulgated with mala fide intent. Otherwise, it will open a Pandora’s box, the counsel said. 
Although the counsel argued that his clients were reinstated through the ordinance and not through the SERA, he emphasised that even after expiry of the ordinance, the right to continue with the job remains in favour of the employee. 
He said the ordinance was a law unto itself and reflects the legislative powers of the president. 
The case will be taken up again on Tuesday.
