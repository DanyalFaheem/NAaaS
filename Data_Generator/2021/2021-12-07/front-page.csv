0,Ex-IHC judge accuses Saqib Nisar of persecuting him,Justice Bandial asks Shaukat Siddiqui not to malign judiciary,"ISLAMABAD: Former judge of the Islamabad High Court, Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui on Monday accused former chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) Mian Saqib Nisar of persecuting him, alleging the head of his institution was after his neck and in search of an opportunity to throw him out of the judiciary.  
“Had I issued contempt notices to two officers of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) namely the then director general Maj Gen Faiz Hameed and Brig Irfan Ramay for paying a visit to my house in June 2018, another reference would have been filed against me,” Mr Siddiqui, who had faced three different references, said. He requested the five-judge Supreme Court bench to understand the circumstances he was faced with then.  
“Would you hang me for this,” the former judge asked in an angry tone and went on to add, “Let me be hanged.”  
Headed by Justice Umar Ata Bandial, the bench had taken up an appeal by former outspoken judge Siddiqui against the opinion of the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) and the Oct 11, 2018 notification under which he was removed as the superior court judge for his July 21, 2018 speech at the District Bar Association, Rawalpindi.  

Justice Bandial asks Shaukat Siddiqui not to malign judiciary

In his speech the former judge had made remarks about involvement of certain officers of the executive organ of the State, specifically the ISI, in the affairs of the judiciary to allegedly manipulate formation of the benches of the high court.  
“I have to my credit seven years of my life as a judge, another 23 years as a lawyer and now three years as a litigant and understand the entire judicial system vividly,” said Mr Siddiqui whose enrolment as a lawyer before the apex court has been recently reinstated by the Pakistan Bar Council.  
Justice Bandial reminded Mr Siddiqui’s counsel Hamid Khan that his client was a party in the case, regretting that such kind of an outburst was below any standard. Even the worst party in a case never behaved like this, Justice Bandial observed, asking Mr Khan not to encourage his client to come to take the stage to malign and degrade the institution of the judiciary when his counsel was arguing.  
“There is no room for sentiments and I don’t like this attitude,” Justice Bandial observed. “We as judges have to decide cases at hand on the basis of law and the constitution only.”  
Mr Khan pleaded that his client was under immense pressure because he was being hounded and witch-hunted by the ISI for a long time.  
To a query by the bench, the counsel said a show cause notice was issued to the former judge by the SJC only because of the observations he had made in a case relating to the Nov 2017 four-week long sit-in staged by the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan. As a judge of the high court, he had directed the law enforcing agencies to clear Faizabad junction by shifting the TLP dharna to some other place like the Parade Ground, the counsel explained.  
“My client was under cloud for some time because he was being perceived as an independent judge,” the counsel argued.  
Justice Ijaz-ul-Ahsan said the court wanted to distinguish whether the order sheets in that case contained the observations made by the former judge or it was mere observations.  
Justice Sajjad Ali Shah wondered whether the observations made during the hearing of the dharna case were also mentioned in the complaint before the SJC by former MNA Jamshed Dasti.  
Justice Bandial observed that the court wanted to see the complaint to understand whether it reflected independence of the judge or his prejudice and again emphasised the decorum and dignity of the court.   
The counsel was asked to furnish complete documents, including the complaint before the SJC and the orders sheets in the dharna case, by Tuesday (today).  
The counsel argued that the show cause had also alleged that no independent confirmation was available about the meeting of the former judge with the ISI officers to discuss the judicial matters. Had an independent inquiry been conducted, Mr Siddiqui could have asked the SJC to summon those officers for examination, the lawyer said.  
At this Justice Sardar Tariq Masood wondered why the former judge met the ISI officers at his residence.   
The counsel argued that even the worst accused in a case was never denied the opportunity of due process, which was denied to his client.  
Justice Bandial recalled that the former judge never denied the allegations of his meeting with the ISI officers in response to the Feb 22, 2018 SJC show cause notice, like the contents of the speech before the Rawalpindi bar were also never denied.  
Hamid Khan argued that judges made speeches at public forums and cited the recent speech by incumbent CJP Gulzar Ahmed at a Lahore function, adding that speeches made by the judges did not fell within the ambit of misconduct but a duty was cast on the SJC to hold an inquiry into the allegations in case of improper contents of statements made by the judges.   
The counsel recalled that proceedings in the Jamshed Dasti complaint were later dropped by the SJC.  
Justice Ahsan observed that the counsel was trying to establish that the judges did go to public forums and made speeches for which they were never made answerable before the SJC.  
During the hearing Justice Bandial also recalled how former CJP Jawwad S. Khawaja had once asked him whether swan rode or swam in the pond. Justice Bandial answered that swan sailed smoothly like a boat but Justice Khawaja explained that though the surface seemed calm underneath the water, swan was peddling continuously.  
“Likewise the conduct of the judge is to demonstrate supreme calmness and serenity,” Justice Bandial explained, adding that the judges were supposed to control themselves even if there was a fire erupting inside them.  
“We are also made subject to criticism but we always keep quiet with a smile since it is the order or the judgement of the judge that matters,” Justice Bandial observed.   
The court postponed further proceedings till Tuesday (today).

1,Travellers from nine more countries banned,"ISLAMABAD: As the new Covid-19 strain Omicron reached several other regions, Pakistan on Monday added nine more countries...","• 13 countries added to category B as Omicron spreads
• Essential travel permitted after obtaining certificates from exemption committee    
ISLAMABAD: As the new Covid-19 strain Omicron reached several other regions, Pakistan on Monday added nine more countries — mostly from Europe — to category C and imposed air travel restriction. 
The countries are the Netherlands, Hungary, Ukraine, Ireland, Slovenia, Poland, Croatia, Zimbabwe and Vietnam. 
On the other hand, 13 countries have been included in category B. They are the US, United Kingdom, Germany, Azerbaijan, Mexico, Sri Lanka, Russia, Thailand, France, Afghanistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Austria and Turkey. The remaining nations remain in category A. 
Moreover unvaccinated Pakistanis, having valid proofs, have been allowed to return. 
These decisions were taken at the meeting of the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) on Monday, which discussed the prevailing Covid-19 situation across the globe in order to revise the categorisation policy for air travel. 
It is worth mentioning that on Nov 27, the forum had prohibited air travel from South Africa, Hong Kong, Mozambique, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini and Botswana by placing them in category C. Hong Kong was later moved to category A. 
According to the NCOC, there will be complete ban on inbound travel from countries listed in category C, however, essential travel will be allowed after obtaining certificates from the exemption committee and undergoing health protocols, including 100pc vaccination for all inbound travellers. 
Those passengers aged six years and above (locals/foreigners) must be in possession of a negative PCR test report (maximum 48 hours old) before boarding.  
Deportees are exempted from the PCR test/report requirement, but all inbound passengers (six years and above) travelling via direct or indirect flights from category C countries will undergo the rapid antigen test (RAT) on arrival at the airport. 
“RAT negative cases from Omicron-hit countries will have to undergo three days of mandatory quarantine followed by a PCR test conducted by the civil administration on the third day,” the NCOC stated, adding that RAT positive cases would be quarantined for 10 days and their PCR test undertaken on the eighth day of quarantine.  
In case of a negative result, passengers will be allowed to proceed, but if the test turns out positive, they will either undergo additional quarantine or will be shifted to a hospital as per advice of the health authorities, the forum said. 
On the other hand, for inbound passengers from category B countries, 100pc vaccination will be required while those aged six years and above (locals/foreigners) must possess a negative PCR test report (maximum 48 hours old) before boarding.  
Similarly, “RAT of passengers from random flights will be conducted at the airport on arrival from category B countries. Negative cases will be allowed to proceed while positive ones will be quarantined for 10 days,” the NCOC said, adding that all other nations not included in categories B and C will fall in category A. 
The forum also stated that screening of transit flights would be carried out, including 100pc RAT of passengers on transit flights arriving via Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar as a precaution against Omicron variant. 
However exemption/waiver have been announced for some categories under which all Pakistanis can travel from category C countries without exemption till Dec 15, however, the above-mentioned health/testing protocols on arrival will remain applicable. 
“Pakistanis who have already travelled or are travelling to category C countries on short-term visa and deportees are permitted to return without the exemption process. Those citizens who have been unable to get themselves vaccinated abroad (all categories) due to some reasons such as expired visa, illegal immigrants/deportees, pending court cases, medical conditions/issues, pregnant women and partially vaccinated from Pakistan are exempted from mandatory vaccination after producing a valid proof to airline/immigration authorities before boarding,” the forum stated. 
Meanwhile, the NCOC data showed that 10 patients succumbed to Covid-19 and 336 more people got infected in the past 24 hours with the national positivity rate recorded at 0.78pc. As many as 862 patients are on critical care as of Monday.

2,Govt decides on strategy to wipe out vigilantism,"Senate committee urges govt to take swift and exemplary action to punish perpetrators, facilitators of Sialkot incident.","• Parliamentary panel briefed on security policy
• Senate committee seeks legislation to check misuse of blasphemy laws    
ISLAMABAD: Political and military leadership on Monday decided that the government would pursue a ‘comprehensive strategy’ to stamp out religious extremism and vigilantism. 
The decision was taken at a meeting convened to review the security situation in the country. 
Prime Minister Imran Khan chaired the session that was attended by Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry, Chief of the Army Staff Gen Qamar Bajwa, National Security Adviser Dr Moeed Yousaf, Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar and senior military and civil officers. 
Discussions at the meeting were dominated by the recent incident in Sialkot where a mob had lynched a Sri Lankan national Diyawadanage Priyantha Kumara over allegations of blasphemy. 
The meeting, the PM Office said, resolved to bring the perpetrators to justice. 
It decided that strict punishments would be awarded to the perpetrators and a comprehensive strategy for curbing Sialkot-like incidents would be implemented. 
“Individuals and mobs cannot be allowed to take the law into their hands and such incidents cannot be tolerated,” the participants of the meeting asserted. 
The PMO statement also praised the bravery and courage of Malik Adnan, who resisted the mob in an attempt to save Mr Kumara. The prime minister a day earlier had announced that Mr Adnan would be awarded Tamgha-i-Shujaat for trying his best to protect his colleague from the violent crowd. 
Security policy
The Parliamentary Committee on National Security was, meanwhile, briefed on the broader contours of the national security policy being prepared by the National Security Division. 
While briefing the committee, Dr Yousaf said the policy was “designed to leverage the symbiotic relationship between human security, economic security and military security with the prosperity and safety of citizens as its principal focus”. 
Economic security, he said, was at the core of the comprehensive security concept being put forward by the new policy. 
The NSA gave an overview of efforts put in to prepare the strategy since 2014 when the National Security Division was created. It would be the first national security policy once finalised. 
Several rounds of feedback consultations on multiple drafts were held with all state institutions, including provincial government and the governments of Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir, he said. Over 600 academics, analysts, civil-society members and students across Pakistan, he added, had also been consulted to make the policy process inclusive. 
The NSA said the policy was expected to be a dynamic document that would be “reviewed each year” and “on the transition of government” to help keep it abreast with priorities in a fast-changing global environment. 
A statement issued by the National Assembly Secretariat said that the participants of the meeting ‘endorsed’ the efforts for the preparation of the policy. 
However, members belonging to the opposition boycotted the meeting.  
Legislation to check misuse demanded
In a separate meeting, members of the Senate Committee on Revenue and Finance unanimously and unconditionally condemned ‘the barbaric lynching’ of the 49-year-old foreigner.  
The committee also passed a resolution urging the government to take swift and exemplary action to punish the perpetrators and facilitators of this heinous crime against Islam and humanity.  
The resolution condemned the misuse of the name of religion and the Holy Prophet (PBUH) to commit such unforgivable crimes against another human being and assured the family of the victim and the Sri Lankan nation that the entire nation stood with the victim’s family to make sure that justice is served. 
The Senate committee, however, commended Malik Adnan and others who displayed the real spirit of Pakistan by risking their lives to try and stop the angry mob.  
It also called for the parliament to revisit the laws to ensure strong safeguards against their abuse and misuse for personal or political gains and to call a special session to address and prevent any such extreme acts of violence in the future.

3,ECP ordered to proceed on plea against Faisal Vawda,IHC bench observes that Vawda has already played hide-and-seek with the court for over one and a half years.,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has asked the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to continue to proceed on the application seeking Senator Faisal Vawda’s disqualification, after a lawyer informed the division bench that senior counsel for the appellant did not expect hearing on Monday and sought adjournment of proceedings on his intra-court appeal. 
While the division bench comprising Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb adjour­ned hearing of the intra-court appeal of Senator Vawda till December 9, it observed that the appellant had already played hide-and-seek with the court for over one and a half years. 
Mr Vawda had earlier resigned from the National Assembly and grabbed a Senate seat before a court decision on a petition seeking his disqualification from the lower house of parliament on the allegation of hiding information about his dual nationality while contesting 2018 general elections. 
In an application filed before the ECP against Mr Vawda in 2020, a citizen, Dost Ali, challenged his election as a member of the National Assembly for deliberately hiding information about his American nationality while filing nomination papers for the elections. 
The application mentioned that Mr Vawda had furnished an affidavit to the ECP to the effect that he was not a national of any other country at the time of contesting the elections. It stated that since the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leader had made a ‘false statement on oath’, he was disqualified under Article 62 (1)(f) of the Constitution. 
A three-member ECP bench, headed by Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja, while hearing the petition gave Mr Vawda the last chance to come up with the evidence in his support and adjourned hearing till Dec 23. 
Senator Vawda in his intra-court appeal asked the IHC division bench to consider facts that he claimed the single bench of the IHC, headed by Chief Justice Athar Minallah, had overlooked while rejecting his petition seeking halt to ECP proceedings in matter pertaining to his disqualification. 
In the intra-court appeal, Senator Vawda further stated that the complainant against him failed to approach the election tribunal within the prescribed timeframe. He argued that Justice Minallah did not hear his contention, disposed of his petition, and directed the ECP to ascertain as to whether the lawmaker was a dual national at the time of filing of nomination papers. 
Justice Minallah observed that if the ECP would find anomalies in Vawda’s declaration, he might be proceeded for contempt of court since the five-member bench of the Supreme Court had declared that filing a ‘fake affidavit’ before the returning officer would be contemptuous and besides disqualification it would entail penal consequences.  
When the intra-court appeal came up for hearing on Monday, a junior lawyer appeared before the division bench of the IHC and informed the court that the senior counsel for the appellant could not come as he did not expect hearing on the day. The lawyer then sought adjournment of the proceedings of the intra-court appeal. 
While observing that the appellant sought adjournment to delay the ECP proceeding, the bench asked the ECP to continue the proceeding on the application and put off the hearing till Thursday.

4,PDM announces plan for march on Pakistan Day,"Differences persist on issues of resignations, converting rally into sit-in; minister lashes out at Maulana Fazl ...","ISLAMABAD: In what appears to be an action replay of last year, the opposition Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) on Monday announced that it would hold a march to Islamabad against price hike in the country on the Pakistan Day on March 23.  
The decision was announced by PDM president Maulana Fazlur Rehman while briefing reporters after presiding over a meeting of the heads of the component parties, which was also attended by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supreme leader Nawaz Sharif and Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif via video link.  
Despite repeated questions by reporters, Maulana Fazl refused to tell whether their protest march would be a one-day event or it would be converted into an indefinite sit-in. “You have heard the date of 23rd March. See what happens next,” said the Maulana in response to a question during his brief press conference which was not attended by any of the PML-N leaders.  

Differences persist on issues of resignations, converting rally into sit-in; minister lashes out at Maulana Fazl over date for protest rally 

Interestingly, unlike the past, the Maulana did not use the term “long march” and instead called it a ‘mehangai march’ (march against price hike).  
Maulana Fazl, who is also chief of his own faction of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F), said the meeting had also discussed the option of submitting en masse resignations from the legislatures, but added that its timing would be announced later.  
“The issue of resignations from the assemblies came under discussion. There is a consensus in principle [on the issue]. However, we will ourselves decide as to when should we use this [resignation] card. We will decide about it when the time will come and with our own consent,” he declared.  
Another “big decision” taken by the opposition leaders in their much-anticipated meeting was that the PDM would organise a seminar on the issue of price hike, growing poverty and unemployment in the country for which it would extend invitations to the lawyers’ bodies and civil society. The Maulana did not announce any date for the seminar and said the PDM’s steering committee would meet on Tuesday (today) to finalise its strategy in line with the decisions taken at the meeting.  
When asked about the selection of the date for the march, the PDM chief said it would be a republic day and they had the right to raise issues of the public on the day.  
It was the fourth meeting of the heads of the component parties in two months, besides a number of meetings of its steering committee, with the agenda of finalising the plan to launch, what they always use to say, a decisive and final phase of the anti-government protest that would culminate with a long march towards Islamabad.  
It may be recalled that the PDM had also announced in January that it would hold a “decisive” long march to Islamabad on March 26 this year, but it had to cancel the plan just two weeks before the announced date when the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Awami National Party (ANP) objected to the Maulana Fazl’s decision to link the en masse resignations from the assemblies with the proposed long march.  
Later, the alliance was formally broken up when the PPP nominated Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani as the opposition leader in the Senate in violation of the decision of the PDM which had decided that the office would go to the PML-N.  
Sources in the opposition parties told Dawn that there were differences among the parties, mainly between the two major components of the PDM — JUI-F and the PML-N — over the issues of en masse resignations from parliament and converting the long march into an indefinite sit-in.  
Besides this, the two parties also had different viewpoints on the issue of boycotting the upcoming local government elections in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. However, the JUI-F chief announced on Monday that they would participate in the upcoming local government elections.  
The sources said Maulana Fazl believed that they should start their long march after submitting resignations from parliament, whereas the PML-N was against the idea, saying that such a move would prove futile if collective resignations do not come from all the opposition parties, including the PPP.  
In their last meeting on November 23, the PDM had failed to come up with a plan to launch its anti-government protest campaign, with Maulana Fazl declaring that they would meet on December 6 and devise “a final policy” and “announce very important decisions”. In the meeting, the Maulana was so furious with the PML-N leadership that at one stage he reportedly even offered to quit the opposition alliance’s presidentship. However, Nawaz Sharif persuaded the PDM chief not to do so and sought time till December 6 for in-house consultations.  
Earlier, on November 6, PDM’s general secretary Shahid Khaqan Abbasi had announced that they had decided to launch a “decisive” anti-government protest campaign, starting with a public meeting in Karachi on November 13 and culminating with a long march to Islamabad, the date of which would be finalised later.  
The PDM had started its protest campaign in October last year with public meetings in major cities. Some of the public gatherings were also addressed by self-exiled PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif through video link. The first phase of the alliance’s movement came to an abrupt end when the PDM leadership failed to announce any future programme following its last public meeting in Lahore on December 31, 2020. 
Govt reaction 
Federal Minister for Information Fawad Chaudhry lashed out at the PDM president for giving the call to hold march in Islamabad on the Pakistan Day.  
“March 23 is the most important day for the people of Pakistan. The day is meant for uniting the nation, not dividing them,” the minister said while talking to the media. He said the PDM’s date and policy for the march was not final as Maulana Fazlur Rehman had a track record of changing his policies in the past.  
The opposition had every right to launch the march and hold discussion on inflation, but there had been some reservations over the behavior of Maulana Fazl who wanted to derail the system so that he could get some political leverage, the minister said, expressing the hope that the date would be changed.  
He claimed that at the PDM meeting, those who were part of parliament had expressed different points of view from those who were not part of the system. The minister said Maulana Fazl was taking a solo flight as nobody supported his march and policies. “Have some courage Maulana Fazlur Rehman and look to your right and left, there is no one with you as you are alone [in this altogether],” he added.

5,"Russia agrees to allow direct flights, NA panel told","Banking links, enhancing scope of scholarships for science education also on the cards in Russian relations.","ISLAMABAD: Russia has agreed to have direct flights from Pakistan by allowing the use of its air corridor with Central Asian Republics (CARs) and open direct banking links besides enhancing the scope of scholarships for technical and science education disciplines which are prohibited for Pakistan in the western world.  
“These are major breakthroughs” in the post-cold war era, Minister for Economic Affairs Omar Ayub Khan told the Standing Committee of the National Assembly on Economic Affairs at its meeting presided over by Mir Khan Mohammad Jamali on Monday.   
He said physical work on two major projects from CARs — Central Asia South Asia Power Transmission Line (CASA-1300) and Turkmenistan-Pakistan Gas Pipeline — had come to a halt due to recent Afghan situation.  
Mr Khan, who has recently returned from Russia, told the meeting that for the first time the two sides had signed a memorandum of understanding for banking communication and the central banks of the two countries would now make arrangements for banks and financial institutions to settle financial transactions.  

Banking links, enhancing scope of scholarships for science education also on the cards   

Mr Khan said the two sides had committed to meet every month until they signed a shareholding agreement by February 15 to achieve major milestones for the Russian and Pakistani nominated entities on $2 billion to 2.5bn worth of PakStream Gas Pipeline project. 
He said Russian government had set up a private sector special purpose vehicle — PakStream Company — to implement the project from Karachi to Lahore. With 90 per cent investment to come from Russia, Pakistan’s state-run Inter-State Gas Systems would be part of the project that would move towards physical implementation after the shareholding agreement is signed in February.  
He said the two sides had also finalised draft of the minutes under which the air-corridor between the two nations would open. “This is another breakthrough with Russia” because it took almost 21 hours to reach Russia and adjoining CARs Turkmenis­tan, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan etc. The direct air traffic will ensure travel between Islamabad and Moscow in four hours and provide direct access with CARs as well.  
He said the two sides were also engaged in discussions on modernisation of Pakistani railway network and rolling stock with the Russian assistance and investment, including supply of rolling stock and equipment.  
The minister said Russia’s technological advancement was very high and it had agreed to enhance scholarships and admissions to Pakistani students of various disciplines of higher learning in which the West was not allowing Pakistani students. Some of the areas he quoted are: artificial intelligence, robotics, advanced computing, nano-technology, advanced mathematics, cryptography and cyber security.  
Overall, the committee was informed that after cold war the Russians had now shown unprecedented interest in making investments in Pakistan by laying Pak Stream Pipeline, establishing banking channels to enhance mutual trade, starting direct flights between Russia and Pakistan and increasing scholarships quota for Pakistani students in higher technical courses.  
During the course of discussion on ongoing negotiations for economic co-operation with other countries, the committee was informed that several projects worth billions of rupees would be undertaken as a result of negotiations with European Union, Uzbekistan, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Germany, Russia and Azerbaijan.  
The committee was also told that with financial assistance by Germany, a centre of excellence would be established at Karakoram University, Gilgit, to determine the ratio of glacier melting at Karakoram Mountain range and some low powered hydro-power projects in Gilgit-Baltistan and a low-powered grid station at Chakwal would be established.  
The committee did not encourage discussion on PTI member Alia Hamza’s proposal for an investigation and action against Asma Jehangir Foundation when the agenda relating to funding for international and domestic non-governmental organisations came up. Ms Hamza said NGOs receiving funds from abroad should be proceeded against and banned for criticising judges and institutions and allowing a convict (PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif) to address a conference. Some members believed that even such proposals to contain freedom of expressions could affect GSP plus trade besides other commercial and financial cooperation.  
The committee expressed concern over non-completion of some projects in time. The committee directed the Economic Affairs Division to provide details of agreements signed with the Saudi government in next meeting.   
The committee unanimously condemned brutal murder of a Sri Lankan citizen in Sialkot by a violent mob. Terming the incident an act as against humanity, the panel called for stern action against the culprits.
