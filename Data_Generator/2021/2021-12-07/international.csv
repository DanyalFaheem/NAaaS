President Alexander Van der Bellen formally swore Nehammer in at a ceremony at Vienna’s Hofburg Palace just after 1 pm local time.
The previous Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg offered his resignation on Thursday, hours after his predecessor and close ally Sebastian Kurz announced he was resigning as head of the conservative People’s Party (OeVP) following a corruption scandal.
On Friday the party nominated Nehammer, 49, to take over as party head and chancellor.
Nehammer’s first act has been to send Schallenberg back to his previous post as foreign minister and appoint new finance, interior and education ministers.
Speaking to reporters after Monday’s ceremony, Nehammer acknowledged there was an  “unbelievable” amount to do to steer the country out of the partial coronavirus lockdown imposed on November 22 in response to rising case numbers.
The lockdown is due to end this weekend and Nehammer said he would consult with experts and the opposition in the coming days on the next steps. Austria is also set to make coronavirus vaccination compulsory.
According to leaks of the draft law for the measure, those refusing vaccination will be punished with a 600 euro ($680) fine which could be re-imposed every three months.
The measures have prompted much opposition, in particular from the far-right Freedom Party (FPOe), and a series of large demonstrations.
Nehammer acknowledged the  “strain” the virus had put on people, adding that  “for many, the limit of what is bearable has been overstepped”.
While promising to listen to concerns, he appealed for unity, saying that  “division harms us all as citizens”.
Van der Bellen said in order to rebuild trust the government should not  “make promises it later won’t be able to keep”.
Kurz had been criticised for effectively declaring the pandemic over for vaccinated people earlier this year.
The scandal that brought down Kurz — who in 2017 became the world’s youngest democratically elected head of government at 31 — erupted in early October.
Prosecutors ordered raids at his office and the finance ministry over allegations that Kurz’s inner circle used public money to pay for polls tailored to boost his image and ensure positive coverage in a mass-market tabloid. Kurz denies any wrongdoing.
After stepping down as chancellor in October, he had been widely viewed as biding his time for a political comeback, but announced on Thursday he was leaving politics to spend more time with his partner and newborn son.
In contrast to Kurz, who concentrated power around himself and a small group of trusted aides, under Nehammer the OeVP’s traditionally powerful regional heads are expected to wield more influence.
Born in Vienna, Nehammer worked in the army for several years before becoming a communications adviser.
He became a lawmaker in 2017 and interior minister in January 2020 months before Austria faced its first jihadist attack, which killed four people last November.

1,ICC prosecutor defends dropping US from Afghan probe,"“The worst crimes in terms of gravity and scale and extent seem to be committed by IS and also Taliban,” says prosecutor.","THE HAGUE: The International Criminal Court’s prosecutor on Monday defended omitting the United States from a probe in Afghanistan, saying the  “worst crimes” were committed by the Taliban and the militant Islamic State group.
Rights groups criticised Karim Khan’s decision in September to  “deprioritise” the investigation into American forces, and focus instead on Afghanistan’s new rulers and the rival IS-Khorasan outfit.
“I made a decision, based upon the evidence, that the worst crimes in terms of gravity and scale and extent seem to be committed by the IS and also the Taliban,” Khan told a meeting of ICC countries in The Hague.
“And I said I would prioritise these and I have asked the judges for authorisation to carry out those investigations,” added the British prosecutor.
The ICC’s Afghan probe into US crimes had long enraged Washington, and prompted the administration of president Donald Trump to impose sanctions on Khan’s predecessor Fatou Bensouda.
The world’s only permanent war crimes court launched a preliminary investigation in Afghanistan in 2006, and Bensouda asked judges to authorise a full probe in 2017.
Bensouda said there was  “reasonable” suspicion of war crimes by both the Taliban, and by US forces in Afghanistan and the CIA in secret detention centres abroad.
The now-deposed government in Kabul then asked the court early 2020 to pause its inquiry while it probed war crimes domestically.
But Khan in September asked judges to relaunch the probe, saying the Taliban’s takeover in August meant war crimes would no longer be investigated properly.
Judges have asked for more clarity over who is officially in charge in Afghanistan before deciding.
The British prosecutor meanwhile said that while the recent coup in Sudan had  “caused a bit of a hiatus”, he expected his team to be able to return soon to continue its war crimes probe there.
Khan visited Khartoum in August to sign a cooperation deal to push through a genocide trial for ex-dictator Omar al-Bashir over the Darfur conflict.
He added that the  “time for change is ripe” at the ICC in general, reiterating earlier promises to focus on cases with a likely chance of conviction and drop those where successful prosecution is unlikely.

2,Nagaland chief minister urges Delhi to repeal army’s special powers,"""It is damaging the image of our country which is the world’s largest democracy,"" he says.","NEW DELHI: A top elected official in India’s northeast region called on Monday for the withdrawal of emergency powers granted to Indian troops, a day after soldiers killed over a dozen civilians, sparking violent protests in the troubled state.
India’s remote northeast region which includes eight states is home to dozens of separatist insurgencies led by ethnic rebel groups.
Nagaland state’s Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio said his government wants the longstanding Armed Forces Special Powers Act, or AFSPA, repealed.
AFSPA is damaging the image of our country which is the world’s largest democracy, Rio said at the funeral services for the dead civilians, in the district of Mon, the site of the incidents.
Rio reiterated that authorities would pursue justice for those civilians killed. Rio is an ally of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modis ruling party, the far-right Bharatiya Janata Party.
Fourteen civilians and a soldier were killed in a series of violent incidents over the weekend in Nagaland state, officials said. At least 28 civilians were also wounded in the clashes and some of them were in critical condition, police said.
The killings prompted calls from local residents and politicians for the revocation of the act that gives the military in some parts of India’s northeast sweeping powers to search, seize and even shoot suspects on sight without fear of prosecution.
Under the act, local authorities need federal approval to prosecute army or paramilitary soldiers in civilian courts.
People in Nagaland for years have accused security forces of exceeding the powers granted to them under the 1958 AFSPA in their counterinsurgency operations. Human rights groups have called the act draconian and pleaded for its repeal for decades.
The Indian military said soldiers fired at a pickup truck on Saturday after a tip about a movement of insurgents in the state’s remote Mon district along the border with Myanmar. Six civilians were killed, prompting violent protests by angry villagers who torched three army vehicles. The soldiers responded by firing at them, killing seven more people, officials said. One soldier was also killed in the clash with protesters.
Locals said the victims were miners returning home to their village when soldiers ambushed the truck carrying them.
The violence escalated on Sunday when protesters attacked an army camp and set some residential quarters on fire. Army soldiers used live ammunition at the crowd, killing one more person.
Police have ordered an investigation amid rising tensions in the state. The Indian army in a statement said the operation was based on credible intelligence but expressed regret and called it a case of mistaken identity.
Local residents rejected the military statement and demanded an independent probe.
If the operation was based on the so-called credible intelligence then how could it be a case of mistaken identity, said Phangnon Konyak, a local tribal leader. It was a cold-blooded murder.
Speaking to hundreds of people gathered at the funeral services, Chief Minister Rio said Nagas will never forget the slain civilians as their coffins were lined up on the ground. Mourners put wreaths on the coffins during the funeral services and displayed protest placards. Killing of innocent civilians is terrorism, one placard read.
Rio also offered financial assistance to the families of the victims.
Rebels, as well as local leaders and other groups, have campaigned for decades for demands ranging from independent homelands to maximum autonomy within the Indian Constitution.
In recent years, the violence has ebbed but the demands for political rights have amplified even as the federal government has pushed for talks with separatists.
In Nagaland, the insurrection began in the mid-1950s with rebel leaders seeking an independent homeland. Some rebel groups have since watered down their original demands for an independent homeland and agreed to reach a solution under the Indian Constitution.
Officials say insurgents often cross into Myanmar after attacking Indian government forces in the remote area.

3,Nobel Prizes awarded in pandemic-curtailed ceremonies,LONDON: Winners of the 2021 Nobel Prizes began receiving their awards on Monday in scaled-down local ceremonies...,"LONDON: Winners of the 2021 Nobel Prizes began receiving their awards on Monday in scaled-down local ceremonies adapted for pandemic times.
For a second year, Covid-19 has scuttled the traditional formal banquet in Stockholm attended by winners of the prizes in chemistry, physics, medicine, literature and economics, which were announced in October. The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded separately in Oslo, Norway.
Literature laureate Abdulrazak Gurnah was first to get his prize in a lunchtime ceremony on Monday at the Swedish ambassadors grand Georgian residence in central London.
Ambassador Mikaela Kumlin Granit said the UK-based Tanzanian author had been awarded the Nobel Prize in literature for his  “uncompromising and compassionate penetration of the effects of colonialism and the fate of the refugee in the gulf between cultures and continents.”
Customarily you would receive the prize from the hands of His Majesty, the king of Sweden, she told Gurnah at the ceremony attended by friends, family and colleagues. However, this year you will be celebrated with a distance forced upon us because of the pandemic.
Gurnah, who grew up on the island of Zanzibar and arrived in England as an 18-year-old refugee in the 1960s, has drawn on his experiences for 10 novels, including Memory of Departure, Pilgrims Way, Afterlives and Paradise. He has said migration is not just my story its a phenomenon of our times.
Later on Monday, Italian physics laureate Giorgio Parisi is due to receive his prize at a ceremony in Rome. US-based physics laureate Syukuro Manabe, chemistry laureate David W.C. MacMillan and economic sciences laureate Joshua D. Angrist will be given their medals and diplomas in Washington.
More ceremonies will be held throughout the week in Germany and the United States. On Friday the anniversary of the death of prize founder Albert Nobel there will be a celebratory ceremony at Stockholm City Hall for a local audience, including King Carl XVI Gustav and senior Swedish royals.
A Nobel Prize comes with a diploma, a gold medal and a 10-million krona ($1.15 million) cash award, which is shared if there are multiple winners.
The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded in Oslo because Nobel wanted it that way, for reasons he kept to himself. A ceremony is due to be held there Friday for the winners, journalists Maria Ressa of the Philippines and Dmitry Muratov of Russia.
The Norwegian news agency NTB said the peace prize festivities would be scaled down, with fewer guests and participants required to wear face masks. Norway has seen an uptick in cases of the new omicron variant, and a spokesman for the Norwegian Nobel Committee told NTB that it was in constant contact with the health authorities in Oslo.

4,Sudan police fire tear gas as thousands protest in capital,Nearly 45 people were killed in street rallies between Oct 25 and Nov 22 in clashes with security forces.,"KHARTOUM: Sudanese police fired tear gas on Monday as thousands of protesters rallied against the military-dominated government near the presidential palace in Khartoum, witnesses said.
The demonstrators marched from various districts of the capital, many carrying national flags or chanting  “No to military rule” and  “The army might betray you, but the street will never betray you”.
Sudan’s top general, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, seized power and detained Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok on Oct 25 but, after international condemnation and mass protests, reinstated him in a deal signed on Nov 21.
Critics lambasted the agreement and accused Hamdok of  “betrayal” as pro-democracy activists vowed to maintain pressure on the military-civilian authority.
The top general has long insisted the military’s move was  “not a coup” but a step  “to rectify the transition” toward full democracy that started with the 2019 ouster of autocratic president Omar al-Bashir.
Hamdok, prime minister in the transitional government, has defended the deal, which he signed after his release from effective house arrest.
He has said he partnered with the military to  “stop the bloodshed” that resulted from crackdowns on anti-coup street protests, and so as not to  “squander the gains of the last two years”.
Nearly 45 people were killed in street rallies between Oct 25 and Nov 22 in clashes with security forces, and hundreds more wounded.

5,US proclaims diplomatic  boycott of Beijing Olympics,WASHINGTON: The United States said on Monday it would not send government officials to the Beijing Winter Olympics ...,"WASHINGTON: The United States said on Monday it would not send government officials to the Beijing Winter Olympics in February due to China’s human rights  “atrocities”, after Beijing pledged unspecified  “countermeasures” against any diplomatic boycott.
President Joe Biden said last month that he was considering such a boycott amid criticism of China’s human rights record.
“The Biden administration will not send any diplomatic or official representation to the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympic Games given the PRC’s  human rights abuses,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told a daily press briefing, referring to the People’s Republic of China.
The diplomatic boycott, which has been encouraged by some members of the US Congress for months, would not affect the attendance of American athletes, she said.
“The athletes on Team USA have our full support. We will be behind them 100 percent as we cheer them on from home.”  
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a news briefing earlier in Beijing that those calling for a boycott are “grandstanding” and should stop “so as not to affect the dialogue and cooperation between China and the United States in important areas”.   
“If the US insists in wilfully clinging to its course, China will take resolute countermeasures,” he said, without elaborating.
The United States is due to host an Olympics in 2028 in Los Angeles, raising the question of how China might respond in the interim.
Beijing says it opposes the politicisation of sports, but it has punished American sports leagues in the past, including the National Basketball Association, for running afoul of its political red lines.
Sarah Hirshland, chief executive of the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee, said in a statement following the boycott announcement that Team USA was “excited and ready to make the nation proud”.

6,UN shelves decision on Afghanistan’s representation,Resolution adopted by consensus without a vote by the UN member states.,"UNITED NATIONS: The United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution on Monday indefinitely postponing the international recognition of Afghanistan’s Taliban and Myanmar’s military junta, which would see their envoys accredited at the global forum.
A resolution, modeled on an agreement last week by the influential UN Credentials Committee that includes the United States, Russia and China, was adopted by consensus without a vote by the UN member states.
Last week, the committee recommended to  “defer its decision on the credentials pertaining to the representatives of Myanmar” and Afghanistan during the current session of the General Assembly, which ends in September 2022.
No further meetings of the nine-nation committee, chaired by Sweden, are expected in the short to medium term. For Afghanistan and Myanmar, competing applications for accreditation from both old and new regimes were on the table at the UN.
Wunna Maung Lwin, the foreign minister of Myanmar, which was rocked by a military coup on February 1, appointed on August 18 former military commander Aung Thurein.
But the envoy appointed by deposed leader Aung San Suu Kyi, Kyaw Moe Tun, defied the junta to stay in his post and on August 21 asked the UN to keep him on.
Afghanistan’s ambassador to the UN, Ghulam Isaczai, appointed by ousted president Ashraf Ghani, submitted a request to stay on at the body on September 14.
On 20 September, the Taliban, which swept back to power in Afghanistan in mid-August, asked the UN to accept Suhail Shaheen — a former spokesman for the Islamist group — as the country’s new representative.
Both the Taliban and the Myanmar junta have criticised the UN committee for not confirming their chosen ambassadors.
“This decision is not based on legal rules and justice because they have deprived the people of Afghanistan of their legitimate right,” Shaheen tweeted last week.
Zaw Min Tun, Myanmar junta spokesman, said the committee’s choice did not reflect the reality on the ground.
The committee on Wednesday confirmed envoys of 191 other nations, with one eliciting a reservation from the United States: Venezuela.

7,"Turkey, Qatar vow joint push to reopen Kabul airport",Erdogan’s visit comes as  Turkey seeks to rebuild relations with former rivals in the energy-rich Gulf region.,"DOHA: Turkey  and Qatar on Monday raised the possibility of jointly operating  Afghanistan’s Taliban-controlled airport, as President Recep Tayyip  Erdogan set off for two days of talks in Doha.“We  are going to act together,” Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu  told a joint press briefing with his Qatari counterpart ahead of  Erdogan’s arrival.
“Qatar and Turkey are continuously working with  the interim government in Afghanistan to reach an agreement to open the  airport (so it can function) normally,” Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh  Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani added.
Erdogan’s visit comes as  Turkey seeks to rebuild relations with former rivals in the energy-rich  Gulf region, including the United Arab Emirates, whose crown prince last  month visited Turkey for the first time since 2012.
Simmering  tensions between Ankara and its Gulf rivals escalated after a Saudi  Arabia-led blockade on Qatar by Arab countries in 2017.
Ankara backed Qatar in the dispute, and the two countries have grown closer ever since.
Erdogan,  whose country is reeling from a fresh economic crisis and is searching  foreign investment and trade, said he wanted to use the trip to foster  closer relations with all Gulf states.
“We are in favour of  strengthening our relations with all the Gulf countries,” Erdogan told  reporters at an Istanbul airport before leaving for Doha.
“The  blockade and sanctions imposed on Qatar have been lifted as of the start  of this year. Right now, solidarity is being restored among Gulf  countries,” Erdogan said.The two countries will sign dozens of deals during a visit to Qatar by Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who also sought to meet Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman there, according to two people familiar with the plan.
Such a direct meeting appeared unlikely this week, but could come soon, one of the sources said. It would be the first between the two leaders after the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Erdogan arrived in Qatar, a key regional ally, as Turkey’s economy is grappling with an historic currency crash and soaring inflation following a series of interest rate cuts that he had sought despite widespread criticism.
At a news briefing in Doha, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Turkey had no plans to ask Doha for financial assistance. His counterpart Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani said Qatar was looking at opportunities emerging from Turkey’s economic challenges.
Saudi Arabia’s Prince Mohammed, widely known by the initials MBS, was due to visit Doha on Wednesday.
There had been discussions to set up a meeting between Erdogan and the Saudi prince in Qatar, said a Turkish official and a Gulf official with knowledge of the visit plans.
“The programmes didn’t align ... so it does not appear like there will be a comprehensive meeting this week,” said the Turkish official, who requested anonymity.
“But it is possible for this meeting to take place at a near date when programmes align,” the person said, adding there were  “many opportunities for cooperation” as regional issues are resolved.
There was no immediate response from the Saudi government to a request for comment.
Saudi Arabia last year imposed an unofficial boycott on Turkish imports, as political tensions over the killing of Khashoggi, a critic of the crown prince, spilled into trade between the two regional powers.
After Saudi agents killed Khashoggi in October 2018, Erdogan had said that the order came from the  “highest levels” of the Saudi government, although he did not name Prince Mohammed, who is Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler.
A US intelligence assessment released in February found that the crown prince approved the killing — a charge Saudi Arabia rejects.
Yet Saudi Arabia and Turkey have in recent months been working to amend ties after having been rivals for years over differences on regional issues and political Islam.
On Saturday, French President Emmanuel Macron held face-to-face talks in Saudi Arabia with MBS, becoming the first major Western leader to visit the kingdom since Khashoggi’s murder.
The Qatari minister said the timing of the visits to Doha by Erdogan and the crown prince was a coincidence.
Qatar’s Sheikh Mohammed said Qatar was ready for  “heavily investing in Turkey”, adding it was looking forward to opportunities that may emerge from the talks.

8,Court jails Suu Kyi for four years; junta chief halves term,She will serve her sentence under the house arrest she has been kept under in capital of Naypyidaw.,"YANGON: Myanmar’s junta chief reduced the prison sentence of ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi to two years on Monday, soon after she was jailed for four years for incitement against the military and breaching Covid-19 rules. 
Suu Kyi, 76, has been detained since the generals staged a coup and ousted her government on February 1, ending the Southeast Asian country’s brief period of democracy. 
She has since been hit with a series of charges, including violating the official secrets act, illegally importing walkie talkies and electoral fraud, and faces decades in prison. 
On Monday Suu Kyi was sentenced to two years for incitement against the military and another two years for breaching a natural disaster law relating to Covid, junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun said. 
Former president Win Myint was also initially jailed for four years on the same charges, which the US later blasted as an “affront” to justice. 
Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing later “pardoned” the sentences of both to “two years imprisonment”, according to a statement read out on state TV. 
They would serve their sentences under the house arrest they have been kept under in the capital of Naypyidaw, the statement said, without giving further details.

JOHANNESBURG: Ebrahim Ismail Ebrahim, a veteran of the fight against apartheid who spent years imprisoned on Robben Island alongside Nelson Mandela, died on Monday aged 84, South Africa’s ruling party announced.
Ebrahim passed away at his Johannesburg home after a long illness, the African National Congress (ANC) said in a statement.
He  “was a longstanding member of the ANC, a patriot who served his country in different capacities with humility, dedication and distinction,” the party said.
A largely unsung figure in the chronicles of apartheid, Ebrahim joined the struggle against white-minority rule in his early teens, becoming an ANC youth activist in 1952.
His life followed the arc of the liberation movement — beginning with non-violent protests, becoming a guerrilla fighter, getting imprisoned on Robben Island twice, and eventually joining the democratic government.
Known as  “Ebie”, he was born in Durban on July 1, 1937. As a child, he saw his father get arrested twice for breaking laws that prevented Indians from travelling freely within South Africa.
