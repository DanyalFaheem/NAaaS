0,Govt plans network of sports grounds for youth: PM Imran,"Kicks off Kamyab Jawan sports drive, chairs meeting on climate change.","ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan kicked off what he called the country’s biggest sports gala — Kamyab Jawan Sports Drive — on Monday and said that the government had disbursed Rs47 billion in scholarships and Rs100bn in soft loans to the youth.  
The sports drive is part of four new projects worth Rs4 billion initiated by the present government in coordination with the Kamyab Jawan Programme and the Higher Education Commission to keep the country’s youth engaged in sports and extracurricular activities.  
“Besides promotion of sports activities, the government is also focusing on education and has disbursed Rs47bn in scholarships to 6.3 million youth, the highest number of scholarships in the country’s history,” the prime minister told a huge gathering of youths while launching the sports drive at Jinnah Stadium.

Mr Khan vowed that his government would lay a network of sports grounds across the country as sports gave the youth a healthy life and mental strength to fight the challenges in life.  
“You win and lose in sports and defeat gives you a lesson to rise again. Sports give courage to the people to face difficulties in life,” he said, adding that since the country’s 70 per cent population was under the age of 30 years, the present government had so far developed 300 and 260 sports grounds in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab respectively.  
He said New Zealand, a country of just five million people, had more sports grounds than Pakistan, a country of 220m people, adding that the present government was striving to develop sports grounds in every village, town, tehsil and district across the country.  
The prime minister said that since a new sports policy had been announced, the government was taking all-out measures to reform and strengthen sports bodies and organisations and eliminate mafias from there.  
Mr Khan mentioned his 21 years of experience in sports to advise the youth that they should never feel discouraged after defeat in a game as it provided them an opportunity to review their shortcomings and prepare themselves for the next competition with renewed vigour and spirit.  
The prime minister congratulated his special assistant on youth affairs Usman Dar on organising such a big event and hoped that such talent-hunt drives would help further promote sports culture in the country.  
Besides the participation of 6,000 youths — 3,300 boys and 2,700 girls — in the age group of 15 to 25 years in the sports competition, he said, a large number of youths from the across the country had gathered at Jinnah Stadium to witness the sports drive.  
Climate change
Prime Minister Imran Khan chaired the fourth meeting of the PM’s Committee on Climate Change and was briefed on issues relating to air pollution and violations of the Indus Water Treaty, adversely impacting the bio-diversity of Indus River Basin in Pakistan.  
The prime minister emphasised the need for long-term planning in urban areas where environmental issues, including loss of green cover, sewage treatment, solid waste management and air pollution, needed immediate solution. He lamented that Pakistan’s contribution to global environmental pollution sources was negligible, but the impact of climate change was huge. “Pakistan is not part of the problem, yet we want to be part of the solution,” he added.  
The prime minister approved in principle a concept plan of “Ecological Restoration of the Indus Basin for a Climate Resilient future”.  
The concept plan comprises conservation and pollution control measures to be taken upstream, Indus plain and downstream of the Indus River Basin. A detailed plan will be completed within four months for approval and implementation. It will provide a vision and action-based framework to integrate current initiatives and develop new initiatives to fill the gaps.

1,"Malala urges US to do more for Afghan girls, women","Says she and other educated women “want to see a world where all girls can have access to safe and quality education"".","WASHINGTON: Nobel Laureate Malala Yousafzai urged the United States on Monday to do more to support Afghan women and girls and to ensure their right to education and work.
Ms Yousafzai made the plea in a meeting with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other US officials in Washington on Monday.
Before their closed-door meeting, Mr Blinken described Ms Yousafzai before cameras as “truly an inspiration — an inspiration to us, an inspiration to girls and women around the world”. 
“The young activist from Pakistan,” he said, was “making a real difference,” particularly when it comes to education.
“I’m very much looking forward to talking to her about the work she’s doing, the work that we’re doing, and to hear from her how to be more effective at making sure … that girls and women have equal access to education,” he said.
Mr Blinken did not mention Afghanistan in his brief remarks, but Ms Yousafzai did, immediately. 
“You mentioned that we’re here to talk about equality in girls’ education, but we know that Afghanistan right now is the only country where girls do not have access to secondary education,” she said.
“They are prohibited from learning, and I have been working together with Afghan girls and women’s activists and there’s this one message from them — that they should be given the right to work, they should be able to go to school.”
She demanded “more focus” on education and payments for teachers’ salaries.
To emphasise the urgency of the situation, Ms Yousafzai read aloud a letter from a 15-year-old Afghan girl Sotodah, saying: “She has written this to President Biden, and I will pass it on to you to pass it on to the president.” Mr Blinken said he would.
Ms Sotodah wrote: “The longer schools and universities remain closed to girls, the more it will shadow hope for our future. Girls’ education is a powerful tool for bringing peace and security. If girls don’t learn, Afghanistan will suffer, too.”
Ms Sotodah reminded President Biden that “as a girl and as a human being, I need you to know that I have rights. Women and girls have rights”.
After reading the letter, Ms Yousafzai said she and other educated women “want to see a world where all girls can have access to safe and quality education, and we hope that the US, together with the UN, will take immediate actions to ensure that girls are allowed to go back to their schools as soon as possible, women are able to go back to work.”

2,Law ministry moves summary for appointment of new NAB chairman,Sources say that there is no timeframe to complete meaningful consultations between the prime minister and opposition leader.,"ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of Law and Justice has initiated a process for the appointment of new chairman of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and forwarded the summary to President Dr Arif Alvi for approval. 
The term of incumbent chairman retired Justice Javed Iqbal expired in October. However, the government has extended his term through a presidential ordinance. 
The recent amendments to the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO) allow the incumbent NAB chairman to continue until the appointment of a new chairman. Sources in the law ministry told Dawn that in the summary, the President had been requested to initiate the process of appointment of NAB chairman.  

The government has extended Javed Iqbal’s term through an ordinance 

The law ministry pointed out that in the light of a judgement of the Supreme Court, the President is supposed to consult the prime minister and the leader of opposition in the National Assembly for NAB chairman. The ordinance amended subsection b of section 6 of the NAO to give extension to the NAB chairman by excluding the word “non-extendable” from the statute. 
NAO’s Section 5 says: “There shall be a Chairman, National Accountability Bureau, to be appointed by the President in consultation with the Leader of the House and the Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly.” 
The sources said that although there was no timeframe to complete the meaningful consultation, in case the president felt that the prime minister and the opposition leader could not reach the consensus on a name, the President than can refer the matter to the parliamentary committee. 
Clause (ii) of Section 5 of the NAO states that the committee shall be constituted by the Speaker of National Assembly comprising 50 per cent members from the Treasury benches and 50 per cent from the Opposition benches, based on their strength in Majlis-i-Shoora (Parliament), to be nominated by respective parliamentary leaders. 
Clause (iii) provides that the parliamentary committee may confirm any name for appointment as chairman. 
As per the amended NAO the total strength of the parliamentary committee shall be 12 members, out of which one-third shall be from the Senate.  
“If the National Assembly is dissolved at the material time, all the members of the committee shall be from the Senate.”

Parliamentary Secretary for Information and Social Welfare Bushra Rind was present at the presser. 
Mr Buledi said the cabinet decided to hold local government elections in the province soon. However, it noted that since 70 per cent of Balochistan had no power supply, it would not be possible to use electronic voting machines for the election. 
While discussing the implementation of the development package, the cabinet decided to release Rs182bn to the FWO for the execution of various projects, which included construction of various roads and dams in Awaran and Panjgur districts. 
He said five main roads would be built by the FWO in the province.
The cabinet approved an amendment to the Balochistan Public Procurement Act 2009 under which an electronic system would be utilised for the bidding process, he added.

4,Law that provides for greater data access to Nadra promulgated,"Under the ordinance, different agencies will be bound to provide information to authority.","ISLAMABAD: President Arif Alvi on Monday promulgated the National Database Registration Authority (Nadra) Amendment Ordinance 2021 under which different agencies will be bound to immediately provide their data to the authority.  
According to the amendment made to Section 7 of Nadra Ordinance 2000, non-provision of data to Nadra will be considered an irregularity and action will be taken as per the law.  
A source told Dawn that the dream of introducing highly secured Smart National Identity Card (SNIC) had so far not come true as the card being issued by Nadra did not provide the required functions.  
The main reasons behind ineffectiveness of the SNICs is that the smart card system has so far not been linked with other related departments like banks, tax collection authorities, property registration authorities, immigration department, arms and driving licenses issuing authorities etc.  

Under the ordinance, different agencies will be bound to provide information to authority   

An insider said Nadra had written to the interior ministry many times in the past to allow the authority to link its SNIC system with other related departments but sometimes the ministry was reluctant to do so and sometimes departments concerned were said to be in no mood to share their date with Nadra.  
The SNIC was introduced in Oct 2012 but, the PTI government believes, the previous government was reluctant to make SNIC fully functional and effective as it could expose misdeeds of powerful elite class, politicians and top bureaucrats because bank transactions, tax evasion and sale and purchase of moveable and immovable properties could be traced through the smart card.  
According to the original concept of the SNIC, it should have 35 security features and could also be used as an ATM card in local and international banks, secondary identity card at international airports and insurance card etc. However, till now it is being used as an ordinary identity card.  
Nadra Chairman Malik Tariq, who had introduced the SNIC in Oct 2012 during his previous tenure, had told Dawn that the smart card technology was aimed at improving security by making forgery more difficult as a forger must not only modify the data printed on the face and back of ID card but also the chip to ensure that the two sets of information matched.  
“The chip contains an arsenal of technical measures making modification not only extremely difficult but also easily detectable. It could be an instrument to be used by the government to roll out e-government services powered by Nadra’s National Identity System (NIS),” he had said.  
The SNIC could provide a platform to the government to move towards welfare state by providing accidental life insurance, health insurance, emergency relief, home remittance, pension disbursement and e-voting in future.
