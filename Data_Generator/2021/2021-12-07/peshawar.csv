0,"Nominations of Shaukat Tarin, three others accepted for Senate by-election",RO rejects objections against PTI candidate by rivals from opposition.,"PESHAWAR: Provincial Election Commissioner (PEC) Sharifullah on Monday accepted the nomination papers of adviser to the prime minister on finance and revenue Shaukat Tarin and three opposition candidates for the Senate seat vacated by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Senator Ayub Afridi.
The PEC, who is the returning officer for the polls to be held for the seat, rejected objections submitted against Mr Tarin by two rival candidates, who sought his disqualification from contesting polls on the ground that he had registered vote in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa a few days before the announcement of the election schedule.
The three other candidates included Shaukat Jamal Ameerzada of the Awami National Party, Zahir Shah of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl and Mohammad Saeed of the Pakistan Peoples Party.
Objections were filed against Mr Tarin by candidates Shaukat Jamal and Zahir Shah, whose lawyers insisted that under Article 62 (1)(C) of the Constitution, a candidate contesting for a seat from a particular province should be a registered voter in that province.

They added that Mr Tarin didn’t belong to KP and that he had got his vote registered in Mardan district only a few days ago and obtained a new computerised national identity card with a residential address from the area.
Advocate Ali Gohar Durrani appeared for Mr Tarin and contended that his client hadn’t violated any constitutional provision while filing nomination papers for by-election and that his wife and in-laws belonged to Mardan.
He contended that the CNIC was issued to his client on Oct 28, while his vote was registered in Mardan on Nov 16.
Mr Durrani contended that the election schedule was issued by the Election Commission of Pakistan on Nov 29 after the registration of vote by Mr Tarin.
He added that under Article 62 (1)(C) there was no mention of any duration for a voter to be registered in a particular province for contesting Senate polls from that province.
The counsel referred to several judgments of the superior courts in support of his contentions and insisted that there was no bar on a candidate to contest polls on the basis of the registration of vote in a particular area before the announcement of election schedule.
Polling for the vacant Senate seat is scheduled to be held on Dec 20 in the provincial assembly building.
The candidates can appeal against acceptance or rejection of papers by Dec 8, whereas the relevant appellate tribunal will decide appeals until Dec 10. The ECP will publish revised list of candidates on Dec 11. The candidates can withdraw papers by Dec 13.
The ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf has 96 members in the 145-strong provincial assembly and therefore, defeating Mr Tarin in the by-election is an uphill task for the opposition parties.
Mr Tarin was appointed the federal finance minister on Apr 16, 2021, and served against that post for six months. As he was not a parliamentarian, he couldn’t hold that office beyond six months.
He had to relinquish that post prompting the prime minister to appoint him his adviser on finance and revenue.

4,KP seeks help of Singapore-based facility to control mosquito population,Govt wants to introduce new method to prevent dengue outbreaks.,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has formally requested a Singapore-based facility to help it control mosquito population in the province for the prevention of the vector-borne disease.
“We [KP government] are in contact with the World Health Organisation Collaborating Centre for Dengue Management in Singapore through our country’s high commissioner for the introduction of a new biological method to reduce the population of mosquitoes, a major cause of dengue in the province,” PTI Senator Nauman Wazir told Dawn.
According to Sen Wazir, a resident of Peshawar, the initiative was launched at the request of the local scientists, who visited Singapore after the 2017 dengue outbreak, which killed over 70 people and affected 50,000 more.
He said that Brazil and Singapore had successfully implemented that method through Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes to significantly reduce mosquito population biologically.

Govt wants to introduce new method to prevent dengue outbreaks

The lawmaker said that the WHO’s Pakistan chapter was supporting the move and that a meeting would take place within a week to discuss the anti-dengue plan.
He said that the Pakistan Science Foundation of the federal science and technology ministry was collaborating with the provincial government for the purpose.
“Minister for Science and Technology Shibli Faraz is very active for the introduction of that biological method to prevent dengue outbreak, which occurs every year,” he said.
Senator Nauman said that the authorities in Singapore had assured the KP government’s representatives that they would carry out a training programme for the relevant staff members for the method’s successful launch and implementation and would help the local scientists set up the required infrastructure.
He, however, said that the Singapore authorities won’t give the provincial government the ‘vector’ (mosquito), which they had taken from the University of Michigan in the US.
The lawmaker said that he had also contacted a friend in a Washington university to help get that vector from the University of Michigan.
“Hopefully, we will be able to start the programme in a couple of months,” he said.
“We can establish infrastructure once we finalise arrangements with Singapore. Local scientists involved in anti-dengue campaigns are keen to have the system which has successfully been started in many countries,” he said.
Meanwhile, officials in the health department told Dawn that it was a one-time investment to create a full-fledged infrastructure for mosquito control as dengue had been claiming lives and affecting a large number of people every year.
They said not only dengue but other vector-borne diseases like yellow fever, Zika virus and chikungunya could be also prevented biologically once mosquito population was controlled.
The officials said the new method had successfully been used in many countries for reduction of mosquito population and thus, checking the vector-borne ailment on a sustainable basis.
Meanwhile, the dengue cases continue to fall after the advent of the winter season.
On Monday, the province recorded 11 more cases taking the total tally of its patients to 10,529.
Of the infected people, 10,496 have already recovered, while the number of active patients is 23, according to a health department report. The report said 10 people had died of dengue in the province in the year.

The consultant said such children should be enrolled in normal schools with required facilities for their mainstreaming and creation of an inclusive society.
Assistant commissioner Rao Hashim Azeem said the society had to change its myopic attitude towards PWDs and facilitate their mainstreaming to enable them to play the due role in society like other citizens.
He promised the administration’s full support to civil society organisations working for the rights of PWDs.
Awaz District Forum president Tehsinul Haq demanded of the government to launch a one-window facility for PWDs at tehsil level for the hassle-free issuance of disability certificates.

The experts said that Pashto books market faced a serious blow following a change of government in Kabul in mid August in the outgoing year.

Dr Shahzeb, the hospital’s focal person on HIV-Aids, chairperson department of gynaecology Prof Naila Noor and psychologist Zainab Wali were the keynote speakers.
They shed light on causes of Aids, its symptoms, diagnosis, treatment and how to change people’s perception towards the disease and patients suffering from the infection.
They said over 6,000 people in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were diagnosed with Aids. They said the infection was transmitted through blood transfusion, sharing/using needle with an infected person, sexual intercourse and vertical or generational transmission from parents to offspring.
They said rapid weight loss, diathermia, pneumonia, recurring fever or profuse night sweats, red rashes on body, aching muscles, exhaustion, loss of appetite etc,. were among the symptoms.
The speakers said vertical transmission could be prevented by identifying infected pregnant women, practicing safe delivery practices, infant feeding, regular follow up of a child up to two years of age and tracing and keeping in touch with the infected persons.
Ms Zainab Wali said Family Care Centre was providing free screening, treatment and counseling to Aids patients through its centres established in eight hospitals of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
She said organising awareness sessions at regular intervals was a must to raise awareness and dispel misconception about the disease.
