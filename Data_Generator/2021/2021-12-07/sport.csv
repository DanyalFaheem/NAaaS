0,"Barca, Milan seek spots in Champions League last-16","Atletico Madrid are another Spanish side in danger of not advancing, as they sit last in Group ‘B’.","LONDON: Barcelona’s first Champions League campaign without Lionel Messi in nearly two decades may come to an end in the group stage if they don’t find a way to beat Bayern Munich on Wednesday.
It would be the first time since the 2003-04 season that the Catalans don’t play in the knockout stage of the competition.
Barca are second to Bayern in Group ‘E’, and two points ahead of third-placed Benfica. But a draw or a loss in Germany would allow Benfica to advance with a home win against already eliminated Dynamo Kiev.
Atletico Madrid are another Spanish side in danger of not advancing, as they sit last in Group ‘B’.
They have to win at second-placed Porto on Tuesday and hope that Milan draw or lose at home against group-winners Liverpool.
Villarreal can advance in Group ‘F’ on Wednesday if they avoid defeat at Atalanta, who will move on with a win.
In Group ‘G’, Lille, Salzburg, Sevilla and VfL Wolfsburg can still advance, with Lille and Salzburg needing draws. Lille are at Wolfsburg and Salzburg play Sevilla.
Titleholders Chelsea and 13-time European champions Real Madrid are among those looking to clinch first place in their groups, which is more likely to secure an easier match in the last 16.
Chelsea are tied on points with Juventus in Group ‘H’ and are ahead courtesy of a superior head-to-head record, so a win at Zenit St. Petersburg on Wednesday will guarantee top spot for the defending champions. Juventus finish group play at home to Malmo, who won the Swedish league on Saturday.
Real, meanwhile, host Inter Milan Tuesday in a match between two teams who have already secured a last-16 spot and who can both still win Group ‘D’. Real lead Inter by two points so a point will be enough for Carlo Ancelotti’s team.
Club Brugge and RB Leipzig have no chance of reaching the last 16 but they can still join Borussia Dortmund, Sheriff and Zenit in the playoffs for the Europa League knockout phase.
Club Brugge and Leipzig are fighting for third place in Group ‘A’ behind group winners Manchester City and runners-up Paris St Germain.
Leipzig will host City on Tuesday in an empty stadium due to coronavirus restrictions and with an interim coach in charge after deciding to part ways with American Jesse Marsch on Sunday.
PSG host Brugge in the other group game. Both Leipzig and Brugge have four points.

1,Medvedev leads Russia to third Davis Cup title,MADRID: Russia’s 15-year wait for a Davis Cup title ended on Sunday after another clutch performance from Daniil...,"MADRID: Russia’s 15-year wait for a Davis Cup title ended on Sunday after another clutch performance from Daniil Medvedev. 
Medvedev capped his amazing year with a 7-6 (9-7), 6-2 win over Marin Cilic in the second singles match to give Russia an insurmountable 2-0 lead over Croatia and their first Davis Cup title since 2006. 
“It feels amazing,” Medvedev said. “But I’m more happy for the team than for myself. We have an amazing team, amazing atmosphere. I’m happy to be part of it and bring the points we need.” 
It was the fifth consecutive straight-set victory in the Davis Cup for world number two Medvedev, who three months ago defeated Novak Djokovic to win the US Open for his first Grand Slam title. 
Medvedev got a standing ovation from the crowd and made peace with the Spanish fans following a week of animosity after Russia eliminated Spain in the group stage of the Davis Finals. 
“I loved the atmosphere. It was a really amazing two weeks because it’s never easy to come here in the end of the season and compete. For sure it was the best two weeks of my career,” Medvedev said. 
“I can say that for all of us it’s very important to win here. It’s still the Davis Cup. We still see Novak playing. Rafa [Nadal] won it last time. 
“No matter the format, the best players in the world are happy to represent their country. It’s Davis Cup and we are the winners of it. That’s the most important thing.” 
Andrey Rublev had earlier prevailed 6-4, 7-6 (7-5) over Borna Gojo to put the Russians ahead at the Madrid Arena. 
“It was super tough and I felt a lot of pressure, but it’s good to put my country in the lead,” Rublev told reporters. 
Russia’s other Davis Cup title was in 2002. Croatia were also seeking their third title after triumphs in 2005 and 2018. 
“I still can be proud with the effort,” Cilic said. “We are just sorry we couldn’t get one point to get the doubles guys in the court.” 
The doubles, where Croatia have the top-ranked pair, were not played. 
Russia are the fourth nation to win both Davis Cup and Billie Jean King Cup titles, after the women’s team won that event in Prague last month with a 2-0 victory over Switzerland in the final.

2,St Etienne sack Puel after Rennes thrashing,PARIS: Claude Puel became the first Ligue 1 coach to be dismissed this season after bottom side St Etienne suffered ...,"PARIS: Claude Puel became the first Ligue 1 coach to be dismissed this season after bottom side St Etienne suffered a 5-0 loss at home to Rennes on Sunday. 
The former Monaco, Olympique Lyonnais and Leicester City boss paid the price for winning just two of 17 matches this term, leaving St Etienne behind Metz on goal difference at the foot of the table. 
St Etienne released a statement that said Puel had been relieved of his duties in charge of the first team until further notice. It effectively brings an end to Puel’s two-year spell in charge at a club that was put up for sale in April. 
Rennes heaped more misery on St Etienne as Martin Terrier scored his first career hat-trick. A comical own goal by Yvann Macon and a late strike by 17-year-old Lesley Ugochukwu completed the rout. 
The emphatic result took Rennes to second place, 11 points behind runaway leaders Paris St Germain. Rennes have a two-point lead over third-placed Olympique de Marseille. 
Nice lost at home for the third game in a row as they went down 3-0 to Strasbourg. Ludovic Ajorque gave Strasbourg a first-half lead before Habib Diallo and Adrien Thomasson added late goals. 
Monaco are level on points with Strasbourg in seventh after thumping Metz 4-0. Forward Sofiane Diop found the net in the opening minute, with Kevin Volland, Gelson Martins and Wissam Ben Yedder adding second-half goals.  
Lyon’s defensive frailties were again on display as the seven-time champions twice relinquished the lead to draw 2-2 at Girondins Bordeaux, keeping Peter Bosz’s team in 12th place in what has been a middling first season in charge for the Dutchman. 
In-form Elye Wahi scored as Montpellier beat Clermont 1-0, Angers won 2-1 at Reims and Nantes ended a five-game winless run by defeating Lorient 1-0 away.

An...","MADRID: Rayo Vallecano’s impressive run at home in La Liga continued on Sunday with a 1-0 win over Espanyol.
An own-goal by Espanyol defender Leandro Cabrera early in the second half gave Rayo their seventh win in eight matches at Vallecas Stadium. Their unbeaten streak at home is their best since they also went eight games without a loss in 2002.
The club from Madrid, recently promoted to the top flight, have the best home record among all first-division teams.
“For our opponents it’s very hard to play in Vallecas,” Rayo coach Andoni Iraola said. “The atmosphere here really helps. We want to keep winning, especially when we have the support of our fans.”
The victory left Rayo in sixth place, with 27 points from 16 matches, in the race for European spots.
The winning goal came when Cabrera found his own net while trying to clear a cross by Alvaro Garcia in the 54th minute.
Espanyol, sitting in 11th place, are yet to win in eight away matches this season.
Valencia beat Celta Vigo 2-1 for their second win in their last 12 matches. The victory in Vigo moved them to eighth place. Celta are in 14th place.
Last-placed Levante remained the only winless team in the league this season after a 0-0 draw against Osasuna at home. It was the seventh straight game without a win for ninth-placed Osasuna.
Elche won 3-1 at home against Cadiz to end a seven-match winless streak and move further away from the relegation zone. It was the third straight loss for 18th-placed Cadiz.

Freiburg ran wild in the opening 25 minutes, becoming also the first away team in the Bundesliga to score five times in that period, with Gladbach left shaken to their core. 
Maximilian Eggestein got Freiburg off to a perfect start, firing in from eight metres for the lead. Kevin Schade then rose higher than his marker to drill in a header three minutes later before Philipp Lienhart tapped in from close range in the 12th minute. 
Gladbach had no way of stopping Freiburg, with Nicolas Hoefler’s glancing header getting a deflection to make it 4-0. 
It was 5-0 by the 24th minute when Lucas Hoeler headed in from a metre out after yet another disastrous Gladbach effort to clear a free kick that was floated into the box. Centre back Nico Schlotterbeck made sure of the record-breaking half dozen with a 37th-minute header. 
Freiburg took most of the pace out of the game after the break but it was still only the visitors who threatened while coach Adi Huetter’s Gladbach had long resigned themselves to their fate. 
Hertha Berlin’s gamble on a new coach showed some promising signs earlier on Sunday as the team fought back to earn a 2-2 draw at VfB Stuttgart in Tayfun Korkut’s debut in charge. 
Stevan Jovetic scored twice for the visitors to claim a point and stay just ahead of 15th-placed Stuttgart in the table. 
Korkut was back at his hometown club after his surprise appointment as Hertha coach on Monday following Pal Dardai’s dismissal.

Juan Cuadrado and Paulo Dybala scored at either end of the match for Juve’s fourth win in five league games. 
That sent Allegri’s side to fifth place, seven points behind Atalanta in fourth and the final Champions League berth. They are above Fiorentina on goal difference after Vincenzo Italiano’s side won 3-2 at Bologna. 
Allegri had insisted before the match that he and his players were not being distracted by Juve being investigated for alleged false accounting. 
And Juve got off to the perfect start as it took the lead in the seventh minute when Cuadrado struck direct from a corner that sailed over the head of Genoa goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu. 
The Bianconeri had plenty of chances but it took them until eight minutes from time to extend their advantage mainly because of some brilliant saves from Sirigu. The goal came when Dybala fired home a through ball from Federico Bernardeschi. 
Tempers had threatened to boil over earlier and almost did so when Alvaro Morata was substituted seconds after getting a booking and was shouted at by Allegri on the touchline. 
Genoa have won once in 16 games this term, picking up just one point in four outings since the appointment of former Ukraine and Milan star Andriy Shevchenko. 
The league’s joint-top scorer Dusan Vlahovic scored the winner from the penalty spot in Fiorentina’s victory at Bologna. 
Vlahovic’s 13th goal of the campaign saw the Tuscany side end a run of four consecutive defeats on the road. 
Fiorentina’s Youssef Maleh opened the scoring with a header after half an hour at the Stadio Dall’Ara for his first Serie A goal. 
Musa Barrow pulled a goal back for Bologna before the break but a Cristiano Biraghi free-kick six minutes after the interval restored the visitors’ advantage. 
Vlahovic added the third from the penalty spot after 67 minutes to seal all three points as Aaron Hickey grabbed a late goal for Bologna. 
Ciro Immobile is level with the 21-year-old Vlahovic at the top of the Serie A scorers chart after he grabbed a pair of goals in Lazio’s 3-1 victory at Sampdoria. 
Sergej Milinkovic-Savic swept Lazio ahead on seven minutes before Immobile squeezed in a scrappy second. The Italy forward scored again before the break but Milinkovic-Savic was sent off in the second half and Manolo Gabbiadini netted a consolation for Sampdoria. 
Lazio moved level with city rivals AS Roma, nine points behind Atalanta. 
Gianluca Raspadori struck twice as Sassuolo salvaged a 2-2 draw at Spezia, while Giovanni Simeone’s double capped a stunning turnaround for Hellas Verona as they came from three goals down to win 4-3 at Venezia.

9,Joe Root keeps England line-up under wraps for first Ashes Test,Denies he is indulging in mind games in delaying his team announcement in the face of Australia’s clarity.,"

BRISBANE: England pacer James Anderson attends a nets session at the Gabba on Monday.—AFP

 
BRISBANE: England captain Joe Root chose to keep his likely playing 11 under wraps and was guarded on his intentions if he wins the toss when he spoke Monday for the last time before the first Ashes Test against Australia.
Root addressed media before news broke that the fifth Test of the series will now not go ahead in Perth because of concern over quarantine requirements. 
Australian captain Pat Cummins took the bold step on Sunday of confirming his match lineup, three days before the series begins at Brisbane’s Gabba ground. 
Cummins revealed that Travis Head had edged Usman Khawaja for the final place in Australia’s top order and that veteran paceman Mitchell Starc will play ahead of Jhye Richardson. 
Root skirted issues around the makeup of his batting and bowling lineups. He chose not to discuss whether Haseeb Hameed might retain his place in England’s top three or whether Jonny Bairstow or Ollie Pope might bat at number six. Nor did he address the question of whether veteran quicks James Anderson and Stuart Broad both might play. 
But he left little doubt that Ben Stokes would be in the team. 
All-rounder Stokes was a late addition to the squad after taking an indefinite break from the game in July to focus on his mental health, while also recovering from a second operation on a broken finger. 
Stokes, who tortured Australia with an unbeaten 135 at Headingley to pull off an improbable run chase in the 2019 Ashes, made light of his long layoff by taking 2-31 and scoring 42 not out against the England Lions last week. 
“It’s really been good to see Ben back involved in the frame of things and to get into the limited game time that we had, and to look as good as he did as well,” Root told reporters at the Gabba. 
“I always know that when he gets into that game, he’ll want to put his mark on it, put his stamp on it.” 
Asked about whether he would need to manage the number of overs Stokes bowled, Root said it was important not to pile too much expectation on the 30-year-old after four months on the sidelines. 
“Our whole bowling group, collectively, we can work together to take those wickets,” Root said. “I’m sure Ben will have a big say in that. It’s something we’ll be definitely working to get right this whole series, particularly in that first game.” 
Root denied he was indulging in mind games in delaying his team announcement in the face of Australia’s clarity. 
“I’m not into mind games,” Root said. “I’m just not in a position right now to name our team. The fact they’ve named their 11 doesn’t really concern me or change anything from our perspective. We’ll conduct our business how we want to and let you know when were ready.” 
Root said he had not yet seen the Gabba pitch and couldn’t venture a view on whether he might bowl first if he wins the toss Wednesday. He received the news from an Australian journalist that the pitch looks green, as nothing more than one might expect with a fast bowler as Australia’s captain. 
“Pat’s already put a stamp on things as a fast bowler and captain of Australia,” Root said. “We’ll have a look and if it’s green, let’s see how it looks again tomorrow and on the morning of the game. I’ve not got any clear idea of what I want to do at the toss as yet. Well leave that as late as possible.”
PERTH AXED AS HOST OF FIFTH TEST
Meanwhile, Cricket Australia on Monday confirmed the fifth Test no longer will be played in Perth. The governing body said bio-security requirements, which would have required players to quarantine on arrival in Western Australia, were too difficult to overcome. 
An alternative venue hasnt yet been named but Hobart in Tasmania may be the front-runner. Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales states, along with Australian Capital Territory also have expressed interest in hosting the match. 
“We are very disappointed that we are unable to stage the fifth Ashes Test at Perth Stadium,” Cricket Australia chief executive Nick Hockley said. “We did everything we could in partnership with the WA Government and WA Cricket to make it work under the current border and health arrangements. But unfortunately this was not possible.”
Earlier, the South Australia Cricket Association said the second Test will go ahead in Adelaide next week as scheduled, rebuffing a late call from Western Australia to swap the second and fifth Tests. 
Western Australia officials suggested the England and Australia players could fly directly to Perth from Brisbane after the first Test, avoiding quarantine. 
South Australian Cricket Association acting chief executive Jodie Newton said any change “would be a logistical nightmare.” 
Western Australia has largely managed to keep Covid-19 out of the state with strict controls and it currently bans travellers from New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia from crossing its border without undergoing 14 days quarantine. 
The fourth Test is scheduled to finish in the New South Wales capital of Sydney on Jan 9, leaving insufficient time for the players to complete their period of isolation.

Match officials called off play at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium at 2:00pm, about 90 minutes after the scheduled lunch break as there was no sign of an end to the rain that was caused by Cyclone Jawad. Rain has fallen heavily on each day of the match so far. 
The third session of the first day was lost to rain and bad light and only 6.2 of 98 overs were possible on day two. 
With more rain or thundershowers being predicted in many parts of Bangladesh in the next 24 hours, a draw looks like the only possible result. 
Pakistan, who opted to bat first, reached 188-2 in 63.2 overs with captain Babar Azam batting on 71 alongside Azhar Ali on 52. Taijul Islam picked up both wickets to fall. 
Pakistan won the first Test in Chittagong by eight wickets and lead the two-match series 1-0. Earlier, the visitors swept the three-match T20 International series.

11,India juggernaut rolls on at home as spinners wreak havoc,"MUMBAI: India’s spinners once again bared their fangs, sealing a record 372-run victory against New Zealand in the...","MUMBAI: India’s spinners once again bared their fangs, sealing a record 372-run victory against New Zealand in the second and final Test at the Wankhede Stadium on Monday to secure a 14th consecutive series triumph at home. 
It was the biggest margin of victory by runs for India in a home match, eclipsing their 337-run win against South Africa in a Delhi Test in 2015. 
The 1-0 victory meant India have not lost a home series since their 2-1 defeat by England in 2012 and it also helped Virat Kohli’s side reclaim top spot in the test rankings, pushing New Zealand to second. 
With the series victory, the hosts also avenged their loss to New Zealand in the final of the inaugural World Test Championship in Southampton in June. 
India’s spinners wasted little time in removing New Zealand’s remaining batters on Monday, sealing the victory in a little over three days on the spin-friendly track at the sun-bathed ground overlooking the Arabian Sea. 
Rahul Dravid, the side’s newly-appointed head coach, said the score did not reflect how hard India had to work for the series win after the first Test in Kanpur ended in a draw. 
“I know this result looks a bit one-sided but right through the series we’ve been made to work hard,” said the former India captain and batting great. “There have been phases of the game where we’ve been behind and had to fight back. Credit to the team for pulling themselves out of some difficult positions.” 
Spin-bowling all-rounder Jayant Yadav did most of the damage on the fourth morning, picking up 4-49 — his career-best figures — to cut through New Zealand’s middle and lower order. 
With just a few hundred fans present in the stands to cheer the team on, Ravichandran Ashwin took the final wicket to finish with 4-34 as their opponents were all out for 167 in their second innings, chasing an improbable 540 for victory. 
The wily off-spinner, the world’s leading wicket-taker this year with 52, took eight in Mumbai and was adjudged the player of the series for his tally of 14 wickets from two matches. 
The victory will taste sweeter for India after they rested a number of established regulars while also missing a spate of players due to injuries. 
“To play Test cricket you need passion and intent,” Kohli told reporters. “Indian cricket is in safe hands when you have so many people who have that. People are hungry to play Tests well. It’s nice to see youngsters want to feel what it is to play tests.” 
Opening batter Mayank Agarwal, who played because of players being injured or rested, picked up the player of the match award for his scores of 150 and 62. 
New Zealand’s dogged batters had denied India victory in the first Test after their last pair hung on for 52 balls in a thrilling final session. 
But they were unable to show the same kind of resistance on Monday with India needing just 43 minutes in the first session to wrap up the win after New Zealand had resumed on 140-5. 
New Zealand lost their last five wickets for 27 runs. Henry Nicholls (44) and Rachin Ravindra (18) added 22 of those Monday. Overall they put on 33 runs for the sixth wicket. 
Ravindra was out caught off Yadav in the 52nd over. Two overs later, he trapped Kyle Jamieson (0) lbw and then bowled Tim Southee for a duck two balls later. 
New Zealand slumped from 162-5 to 165-8 in the space of 12 deliveries. Yadav then also got rid of Will Sommerville (1). 
Ashwin completed the win for India as Nicholls was stumped in the 12th over of the morning. The off-spinner was named man of the series. 
“I enjoyed playing here at Wankhede honestly,” Ashwin said. “Every day there was something new and I could challenge both edges.” 
He praised the wonderful performance of New Zealand spinner Ajaz Patel who took 10 wickets in the first innings and 14 in the match. 
Patel’s 10-119 was the other major highlight as he became only the third bowler in Test history after Jim Laker (England) and Anil Kumble (India) to take all 10 wickets in an innings. 
India scored 325 and 276-7 and took control of the match on Saturday after bowling New Zealand out for 62 in the first innings. 
“It was a disappointing performance from us,” New Zealand captain Tom Latham, who took over as captain from the injured Kane Williamson, said. “62 all-out would always have set us back. “You always want to bat first here and it only gets worse for batting. It wasn’t how we wanted it to pan out. [But] it was a very special game for Ajaz.”

A dozen players from Pakistan are taking part in the Lanka Premier League (LPL) T20 competition, including veterans Shoaib Malik and Mohammad Hafeez.
An official from Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) said that extra precautions will be taken in light of Friday’s vigilante lynching in Pakistan, which has caused outrage across Sri Lanka.
“We have enhanced security across the board, not just for the Pakistani players,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The remains of the expat factory manager Priyantha Diyawadana were repatriated to Colombo on Monday, and authorities in Sri Lanka have asked for the culprits to be punished for the  “brutal and fatal attack”.
Few issues are as galvanising in Pakistan as blasphemy, and even the slightest suggestion of an insult to Islam can supercharge protests and incite lynchings.
The five-team LPL began on Sunday and ends with a Dec 23 final.

The second test will be staged in Johannesburg from Jan 3-7, with the third in Cape Town from Jan 11-15 in a revised itinerary after India requested to arrive a week later than originally planned for the tour.
The teams will also contest a three-match One-Day International Series between Jan 19-23, with the first two games played in Paarl and the third in Cape Town.
The Test series will form part of the new cycle of the World Test Championship, while the ODIs will count towards the Super League, the qualification tournament for the 2023 World Cup.
A revised schedule, which has done away with four Twenty20 Internationals that had originally been pencilled in, was agreed over the weekend after India had expressed reservations about touring due to the discovery of the Omicron Covid-19 variant in South Africa.

On a chaotic night in Jeddah, the first race in the Gulf kingdom took almost as many twists and turns as an already astonishing and enthralling rollercoaster season — and also left a bitter aftertaste. 
There were crashes and collisions, safety cars, red flags, and claims of dirty driving after seven-time world champion Hamilton hit the back of Verstappen’s suddenly slowing car on the super-fast Corniche street circuit. 
Extraordinary, at times angry, radio exchanges between the race director Michael Masi and the top two teams filled the airwaves. 
With a bonus point for fastest lap, Hamilton moved alongside Verstappen at the top of the standings with 369.5 points after 21 races. 
Verstappen, who finished second with Valtteri Bottas third for Mercedes, leads 9-8 on wins, however — meaning that the Dutch 24-year-old will be champion if neither he nor Hamilton scores another point. 
Mercedes extended their lead in the constructors’ championship to 28 points and a record eighth successive title looking likely. 
The final race is in Abu Dhabi next weekend. 
“Of course it’s exciting,” said Verstappen, who won last year in Abu Dhabi. “We’re starting again like we started the season.” 
Hamilton’s win in the heat and humidity of Jeddah saw him pass Verstappen with six laps remaining of a chaotic race, as the pair tangled again this season following high-octane crashes at the British GP and the Italian GP. 
“It was clear that others around were willing to take it to all sorts of levels to overtake,” Hamilton said after the race, with Verstappen sat right next to him. “We’ve seen multiple incidents this year.” 
Hamilton is in no mood to back down with the finish in sight, but Verstappen has drawn out the street fighter in him. 
The safety car made its first appearance on lap 10 when Mick Schumacher spun on Turn 22 and slammed his Haas into the wall. 
Hamilton pitted immediately to switch tyres with Bottas following a lap later while Verstappen stayed out to take the race lead. Red Bull’s gamble looked to have paid off when the race was red-flagged shortly after in order for repairs to be done on the crash barriers. 
That handed Verstappen a ‘free’ pitstop and allowed him to begin from the front when the race restarted, ahead of Hamilton and Bottas. 
When the race resumed, Hamilton slipped past Verstappen who then barged his way around the outside, going off the track, to regain the advantage. 
Behind them Sergio Perez was clipped by Charles Leclerc’s Ferrari, causing the Red Bull to spin off. 
That in turn triggered a domino effect with George Russell (Williams) and Nikita Mazepin (Haas) also going off. 
The stewards decided that Verstappen’s manouevre was illegal and promoted Alpine’s Esteban Ocon — who finished fourth after being pipped by Bottas at the end — to pole for the third start of the race, with Hamilton in second and Verstappen in third. 
It was the Dutchman who was quickest out of the blocks, blasting past the other two on the opening corner and setting the world championship title in his sights. 
Hamilton soon breezed past Ocon and was breathing down Verstappen’s neck. 
On lap 36 he attempted to overtake but in a move evocative of their tussle in Brazil, Verstappen cut across Hamilton to keep the lead. Verstappen was ordered to give the place back but as he braked Hamilton ran into the back of him damaging his front wing. 
When the Dutchman was again instructed to make way, he pulled over to let Hamilton pass and then immediately retook the lead. A lap later Hamilton slipped past again to move back in front and this time, with Verstappen also hit by the five-second penalty, he was able to lead all the way to the chequered flag. 
Australian Daniel Ricciardo finished fifth for McLaren, ahead of AlphaTauri’s Pierre Gasly and Leclerc. Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz was eighth, with Antonio Giovinazzi ninth for Alfa Romeo and Lando Norris 10th for McLaren.
