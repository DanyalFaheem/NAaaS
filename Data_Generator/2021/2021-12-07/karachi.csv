0,Opposition rejects talks offer until withdrawal of controversial Sindh LG bill,MQM-P speeds up its campaign for its Dec 11 multiparty conference extending invitations to parties across the country.,"• PTI, MQM-P, GDA warn of protest movement
• JI, ANP invited to Muttahida’s MPC on 11th
• Stakeholders’ conference by PTI on 12th     
KARACHI: The joint opposition in the Sindh Assembly on Monday ruled out any possibility of talks with the provincial government before the withdrawal of the controversial Sindh Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2021, warning the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party that it would face a strong reaction from all political stakeholders who were planning a protest movement against the ‘dictatorial law’.
The opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) and Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) held a press conference at the Sindh Assembly and came up with a joint and consensus strategy about their future course of action against the controversial LG bill, saying they were convinced that in the presence of such a law the upcoming LG elections would become irrelevant for every democratic party.
“It’s not possible until they [PPP government] withdraw this [Sindh Local Government Amendment] Bill,” said Leader of the Opposition Haleem Adil Sheikh of the PTI in response to a question about the possibility of talks between the two sides over the controversial bill.
“The government has extended an offer for dialogue, but the opposition parties consider it meaningless as we should have been consulted before tabling the bill in the assembly. All opposition parties agree that under this black law, local governments have been deprived of powers and made subservient to the CM,” he said.
Speaking on the occasion, MQM-P leader Muhammad Hussain said that there was a time when the provincial government in Sindh was of a different party and local government set-up was run by another party. But even then, no one ever tried to bend or amend the law to deprive the local governments of their functions as they gave space to each other despite serious ideological differences, he added.
“But the PPP government has set a new tradition,” he said. “It has conceded defeat even before the elections and in a pre-emptive move has encroached upon every single power of the local government under this black law. MQM-Pakistan rejects this law aimed at corruption and usurping of peoples’ rights. We stand by with the joint opposition.”
Barrister Hasnain Mirza of the GDA observed that the bill was approved in haste while bulldozing assembly’s rules and from the day one it was clear that the PPP wanted to exclude the opposition from legislation process.
“The move, which itself is illegal and unconstitutional, cannot be recognised for any law,” he said. “The process was not followed and the rules of business were defied. A question on the effectiveness of the bill is another thing and violating Constitution is another. It’s an irony that the PPP passed the bill illegally and now want it to become law.”
The MQM-P has sped up its campaign for its Dec 11 multiparty conference extending invitation to parties across the country. On Monday senior leaders of the party visited the Karachi headquarters of the Jamaat-i-Islami, met its leaders and invited them to their event.
An MQM-P delegation, led by Kanwar Naveed Jameel, met JI’s city chief Hafiz Naeem Naeemur Rahman and agreed on a consensus strategy against the new LG bill in the larger interest of Sindh and its people.
Another MQM-P delegation visited the Bacha Khan Markaz of the Awami National Party and met its Sindh president Shahi Syed. The two sides agreed that the recently passed bill had failed to meet the requirements of an effective municipal system and it was designed to strengthen the elite class of the society.
Also on Monday, the MQM-P organised a protest demonstration in Korangi district against the new LG bill in which a large number of people participated.
PTI gears up campaign
The PTI is also holding an All Stakeholders Conference on Dec 12 for which it has been extending invitation to politicians, businessmen, journalists, etc.
The opposition leader said that the PTI was going to launch a movement against the “black law” and on Tuesday (today) it would stage rallies in three different Sindh districts to mobilise the masses and resist against the illegal bill on all available forums.
PTI’s Karachi chapter president MPA Khurram Sher Zaman met the Association of Builders and Developers and office-bearers of the Karachi Press Club and invited them to his party’s moot.
Abad chairman Mohsin Shaikhani told Mr Sher Zaman the the builders had stopped all kinds of construction activities in Karachi for the past 10 days and he had contacted the prime minister, chief minister and governor to pass a law for the protection of the construction industry.
He hoped that the federal government would ask the Sindh governor to sign the Construction Regularisation Ordinance to protect the construction industry.

6,KMC health facilities to be run through public-private partnership,Pechuho says future govt may abolish Pakistan Medical Commission,"KARACHI: The Sindh government will run healthcare facilities of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation through public-private partnerships to ensure their effective operation, said Health Minister Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho on Monday.
She was speaking at a press conference held to highlight the steps being taken by the provincial government to strengthen the healthcare system.
“The government will only monitor the operation of the KMC healthcare facilities and plan to run them through institutions that have set an excellence in their operation. For instance, we plan to handover the operation of the KMC cardiac unit to the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD) whereas the Dow University Hospital might be asked to run another KMC health facility,” she explained.
The minister’s statement about the KMC-run facilities came against the backdrop of the recently passed Local Government (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which gives total control to the provincial government over municipal organisations.

Pechuho says future govt may abolish Pakistan Medical Commission

Among other things, the new bill also takes back health-related functions as well as operations of several healthcare facilities including Karachi Medical and Dental College and Abbasi Shaheed Hospital.
Plan to set up Sindh Medical, Dental Council 
Asked about the medical and dental college admission test, the minister firmly said the government would follow the cabinet’s decision of setting 50 per cent as the required passing percentage for the MDCAT-2021 exams.
“The Pakistan Medical Commission’s threats that our students would not be registered hold no ground as it’s very likely that the future government abolishes this controversial body,” she said.
The minister announced that the provincial government was ready to legislate on the Sindh Medical and Dental Council that would make a policy on medical and dental college admissions. The provincial governments had the right to legislate on health matters after the enactment of 18th Amendment, she said.
Earlier, the minister briefed about the government’s health initiatives and said the Sindh government aimed at strengthening the public sector system by partnering with private institutions unlike the federal government which focused on the private sector.
Currently, she pointed out, the government was giving a total of Rs57.48 billion grant to numerous hospitals  including the NICVD, Infectious Disease Hospital at Nipa, Dow University Hospital, Gambat institute and Peoples Primary Healthcare Initiative, to provide free-of-cost treatment.

7,Sindh sees increase in girl child marriages despite legislation: report,Increased number of girl child marriages under 18 years are reported from all zones/sub-districts of Karachi except Malir.,"KARACHI: Despite having the Child Marriage Restraint Act since 2013, Sindh has seen an overall increase in girl child marriages between 2014-15 and 2018-19 with Jacobabad topping the list followed by Tando Allahyar, Ghotki and Hyderabad in terms of the highest percentage increase in girl marriage under 15 years.
Within the most urban district of Karachi, an increased number of girl child marriages under 18 years are reported from all zones/sub-districts except Malir. Few cases of child marriage are reported to the law enforcement agencies.
These findings are part of a report — Child Marriage in Sindh: A Political Economy Analysis — launched on Monday at a local hotel.
Organised by the Population Council with support from United Nations Fund Population Fund (UNFPA), the programme was attended by members of the Sindh Assembly, senior government officials, civil society representatives, health practitioners and journalists.

Child marriage perpetuates gender inequality and slows economic, social development 

According to the study, 22 per cent of women of ages 20-24 years reported being married before reaching their 18th birthday in 2018-19 whereas about 7.5pc of them reported being married before 15 years of age, which is higher than national average of 18.3pc and 3.6pc, respectively.
The reported prevalence of girl child marriage rose by 1.3pc for girls married under age 15 and by 2.2pc for girls married before the age of 18 years, between 2014 and 2018-19, in the province.
Across Sindh, 14 districts out of the total 29 districts show an increase in girl child marriage for either girls under 15 or those under 18 years, and nine districts are seeing a rise in both to varying degrees.
Districts Jacobabad (46pc) and Kashmore (42.9pc) in the north of Sindh and district Umerkot (40pc) in the south are hotspots in terms of the highest percentage reported cases of child marriage under 18 years.
Only Sindh has criminalised child marriage
The report highlights Sindh is the only province in Pakistan to formally criminalise child marriage for both girls and boys under18 years of age under the Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act (SCMRA), 2013.
“While the minimum age for marriage for girls has been increased from 16 to 18 years vide amendments to the federal law on child marriage, there is limited discourse on the subject in the province beyond legal solutions, and less emphasis on girl-centered care planning and prevention,” it said.
Maternal mortality ratio, the report points out, which is intricately linked to child marriage, remains high in Sindh.
“Strategies to end girl child marriage in Sindh need to be tailored to sub-provincial contexts and address the political economy drivers of such marriages as the practice is not consistent across districts and may be the result of a combination of different factors that come into play locally,” Sara Zaman, the report’s author, said in a presentation.
She shared evidence on how child marriage perpetuates gender inequality in multiple spheres and slows economic and social development by preventing girls and women from contributing fully to society.
Ms Zaman also presented legal, policy and institutional mechanisms to address the issue emphasising on implementation of laws related to child marriage, promote greater investment in institutional strengthening, and raising public awareness through parents and community leaders.
Need for inclusive approach
SZABIST president and ex-MNA Shahnaz Wazir Ali underscored the need for a multi-sectoral and inclusive approach to address the issue and find rights-based solutions to prevent child marriage. “The government, relevant ministries, civil society and media must come together for collective and transformational change,” she said.
Sindh Population Welfare Secretary Rehan Iqbal Baloch highlighted initiatives being undertaken by the department to improve young people’s access to family planning services. “The Sindh government is working to enhance the family planning programme by focusing on effective coordination to provide timely family planning information, counselling and services to young couples.”
The speakers included Bayramgul Garabayeva, focal person, Sindh office, UNFPA in Pakistan, Dr Haleema Yasmin of the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Dr Talib Lashari, technical adviser, FP 2030-CIP cell, Sindh, and Saifullah Abro, director general of the Sindh Social Welfare.

8,Murad says govt ready to accept opposition’s suggestions on LG bill,KARACHI: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Monday said that the provincial government was ready to talk to...,"KARACHI: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Monday said that the provincial government was ready to talk to the opposition if they had some solid suggestions as it was committed to strengthen the local government organisations. 
“But if they [opposition] are interested only in playing politics, making alliances and filing cases, let them do what they want,” he added. 
He was talking to reporters after inaugurating a newly constructed building of the Al Mustafa Trust Orphanage in Korangi. 
In reply to a question, he said Local Government Minister Nasir Shah had discussed amendments with the opposition parties before placing them in the cabinet and assembly.“It was the opposition’s proposal that towns have been created in the city in place of district municipal corporations and now they have started playing politics,” he said. 
“The opposition has chosen to file cases and make political alliances against the bill. Let them do it because they are not serious in developing the LGs as strong institutions,” Mr Shah said.
He said educational institutions and health facilities were taken away from the local bodies because they had failed to run them properly in the public interest. “But in their place, we have given them the entire public health and all the municipal functions besides representation in other civic agencies,” he added. 
Answering a question about the proposed ordinance for regularisation of illegal construction, the CM said it was aimed at protecting the investment of poor people who purchased the apartment/house in a building. “If a builder constructs a building in violation of rules and regulations, he should be penalised instead of the allottees,” he said and added that he felt sorry over the statement of Governor Imran Ismail against the ordinance, which was against the norms and ethics. 
Mr Shah said that a similar law was already operating in the Punjab and when Sindh wanted to introduce such a law, why that unnecessary hue and cry was being made. 
Addressing the inauguration ceremony of the orphanage, the CM invited all the children living there to the CM House to have lunch with him. Mr Shah said he was glad to be part of the ceremony because it was for a cause that was close to his heart. 
He lauded the services of Al-Mustafa and Haji Hanif Tayyab for humanity. 
Earlier, the chief minister unveiled the plaque to inaugurate the new building of the orphanage.

9,Complete works of Firaq launched,"‘Urdu poetry is marked by meaningfulness extracted out of our own soil, culture and civilisation’","KARACHI: Kulliyat-i-Firaq Gorakhpuri, the complete works of poet Firaq Gorakhpuri compiled by Dr Syed Taqi Abedi, was launched at the Karachi Press Club (KPC).
A lecture on the poet’s works by Dr Abedi, who has flown in from Canada to deliver a series of talks, was arranged at the event held on Sunday evening. 
He said there are very few young languages in the world which have established their firm place (in the literary world) and Urdu is one of them. No other language has the tradition of the mushaira; and in some genres of poetry Urdu has surpassed (aagey nikal gaey hain) some of the older languages. For example, as far the marsiya goes, Urdu has surpassed Arabic and Persian. Urdu boasts classics from Asghar Gondvi to those who are writing in our time. 

‘Urdu poetry is marked by meaningfulness extracted out of our own soil, culture and civilisation’

Dr Abedi said there have been poets in history who were not recognised in their lifetime, such as Firdausi whose worth wasn’t acknowledged in Iran when he was alive; today he is greatly revered in the country. 
He said the book that’s being launched has been published before but the earlier ones had between 230 and 250 ghazals of Firaq. In his compilation he has included more than 600 ghazals, 82 nazms and 50 dohas. Apart from that the quality of content (matn ki sehat) has also been paid attention to. There are ghazals in the book which stretch from 20 to 25 verses. Then there is a muqaddama [preface or foreword] which is in four parts. 
Dr Abedi focused his talk on Firaq’s ghazals, although he also spoke on his rubaiyi’at. He said Firaq was born in 1896 in Gorakhpur and died in 1982 in Delhi. His place of birth was rich in producing noteworthy poets. His teacher urged him to read Mir Taqi Mir, which he did therefore Firaq’s ghazal has many qualities: it is traditional, progressive, modern and postmodern. The poet taught English for 25 years, wrote some stanzas in English and did some translations from that language. However, he earned a living mostly through mushairas, by writing articles and through the royalty of his books.  
The scholar said if one were to look at the local theories of Urdu literature, one would notice that Urdu poetry is marked by meaningfulness (maani aafreeni) extracted out of our own soil, culture and civilisation. Language has its distinct charm. In the past, Urdu culture didn’t allow the portrayal of the female body in an explicit way, but Firaq experimented with it for which he had to answer many questions. Since he taught English literature, he was familiar with mythology which provided him with the opportunity to benefit from that learning.   
Dr Abedi said the other experiment that Firaq did was the use of Hindi words in his poems. Keeping in context women’s beauty he quoted from a rubaiyi whose last two lines were: 
Luqmey ke uthaney mein kalai ki lachak 
Dilkash kitna hai munh ka chalna kam kam 
[Ah, the way her wrist turns when she picks a morsel 
How beautiful it looks when she gently eats it] 
“This is the kind of expression that attracted readers’ attention to Firaq,” he said and claimed the modern ghazal penned by Firaq carries the subject of romance alongside everyday issues of life (gham-i-dauran). One of the last verses that he quoted in his lecture was: 
Chup ho gaey terey ronay waaley 
Dunia ka khayal aa gaya hai 
[Your mourners have gone quiet They’ve begun to think of the world] 
Shadab Ehsani presided over the event, which was moderated by Rizwan Siddiqui.

10,Arguments sought on maintainability of PSP plea against new bill,KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Monday directed the counsel for the Pak Sarzameen Party to advance arguments about...,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Monday directed the counsel for the Pak Sarzameen Party to advance arguments about the maintainability of a petition filed against the new local government bill passed by the provincial assembly.
PSP leaders Arshad Vohra and Syed Hafeezuddin had petitioned the SHC stating that the Sindh Local Government (Amend­ment) Bill, 2021 passed to make changes in the Sindh Local Government Act, 2013 was in violation of various provisions of the Constitution.
A two-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Ahmed Ali M. Shaikh took up the petition for hearing and directed the lawyer to satisfy the court about the maintainability of the petition.
While questioning the maintainability of the petition, the bench asked the counsel how a bill could be challenged in court.
Replying to a query of the bench, the petitioners’ lawyer submitted that the provincial government had sent the bill in question to the Sindh governor for his assent.
The bench adjourned the hearing for a date to be later fixed by the office. 
While citing the chief minister, chief secretary, provincial assembly speaker, LG minister and secretary as respondents, the petitioners argued that the bill was now pending for approval with the governor and if signed it would become part of the SLGA 2013 and the citizens of Sindh would be deprived of all their rights as envisaged under Article 8 of the Constitution.
They maintained that instead of devolving the powers to elected LG representatives, the respondents grabbed all the functions and duties of the local government by passing such a bill despite the fact that Article 7 and 140-A were very clear about the meaning of the state and local government.
The petitioner further submitted that the bill was prejudice for the entire province and especially for Karachi, Hyderabad and other urban areas of Sindh as the amendment in Section 140-A of the new bill (power of government to amend schedules) said, “Notwithstanding anything contained in this act the government shall have power to amend, alter, add or remove any entries from the schedules, by notification and the official gazette”.
Through such an amendment the respondents had taken absolute rights over the province to make changes in the law unilaterally and as absolute authority, they maintained and pleaded to restrain the respondents from enactment and promulgation of the bill in question as an act and subsequent amendment in the SLGA 2013. The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf has also filed an identical petition against the LG bill a few days ago.

13,NA body displeased over reuse of ‘killer’ transformer by Hesco,HYDERABAD: The members of subcommittee of the National Assembly’s standing committee on power and a representative...,"HYDERABAD: The members of subcommittee of the National Assembly’s standing committee on power and a representative of National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Monday expressed displeasure over ‘reuse’ of a transformer by Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (Hesco) that had caused deaths of 10 persons after it exploded in a Latifabad locality on July 22.  
The members met Hesco management at the power utility’s office and conveyed their concern that the ‘killer’ transformer had been ‘used’ again. “Actually the claim was made by Nepra general manager Rafiq Ahmed Shaikh, which was contested by Hesco officers but Mr Sheikh stuck to his viewpoint,” said a committee member.  
Hesco spokesman Mohammad Sadiq said the the Nepra officer’s information was not correct because the accident-hit transformer had not been reused since it burnt on July 22. It had been lying in the power utility’s store since then, he said.  
The committee member said that after Mr Rafiq’s insistence on veracity of his information the Hesco officials backtracked on their position. 
The members observed that Hesco’s appeal against Oct 11 decision of Nepra, imposing fine of Rs26 million on the power utility should be disposed of as early as possible. Hesco was to pay an amount of Rs3.5m to each victim of the July 22 accident.  
They expressed concern over issuance of detection bills to consumers by the power utility without adhering to the set procedure laid down by the authority. 
They said that according to relevant rules, consumers must be served notice and clearly told about the power theft by him or her before the detection bill was issued to them.  
According to convener of the subcommittee, Lal Chand Malhi, consumers’ complaints about issuance of detection bills by Hesco abound and the committee members have taken the issue seriously.  
He said that load management plan needed to be strictly followed as per required guidelines and a faulty transformer should be replaced within six hours but it was observed that the replacement took several days.  
He said that it was mandatory for Hesco to serve notice before issuance of detection bill as per rules but it was not done. “As per practice, the detection bills are being issued by staff without going through legal requirements and consumers are left to suffer,” he said.  
Hesco officers informed the committee members that Rs19bn rehabilitation programme was in pipeline and appeal against Nepra’s decision of imposition of Rs26m fine was also pending disposal.  
The committee members Sabir Kaimkhani, Nuzhat Pathan, Saira Bano, Ghulam Mustafa Shah and secretary of National Assembly Naureen Erum were assured by the newly-appointed Hesco chief executive officer Noor Ahmed Soomro, who had replaced Rehan Hamid, that all problems of customers were being addressed.  
Soomro said that telephonic katchehries were being held and superintending engineers were directed to check issuance of detection bills and settle them at the earliest. He said that load management was being done as per approved guidelines. Some technical faults, however, led to disruption in power supply, he said.  
Embattled CEO not allowed to resume charge 
Meanwhile, as the committee’s meeting was in progress, the embattled CEO Rehan Hamid arrived in Hesco office to resume the charge but incumbent management headed by Soomro did not allow him to do so.  
Hamid warned that he would file contempt of court case against the Hesco authorities to which 
he was told that since the sitting CEO had not yet been de-notified by the ministry he could not take over charge.  
Hamid had received an interim order passed on his plaint by Sindh High Court principal seat last week, which suspended till Dec 22 operation of the ministry’s notification whereby he was removed. The Hesco office gate remained closed and policemen were posted outside. The court was scheduled to hear Hamid’s petition on Dec 22.  
Hamid was removed by the federal energy ministry on charges of misconduct. He has challenged his removal on the ground that he was contracted for three years and was removed when he went abroad to attend wedding of his daughter after approval of leave by the Hesco board of governors.
