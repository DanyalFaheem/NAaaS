IN the history of the Indo-Pak subcontinent, some rebellious movements will all be remembered for successfully mobilising the masses and leaving their mark both politically and socially. Telangana rebellion was one such movement. It took place in the southern Indian region of Telangana between 1946 and 1951 and is often mentioned, especially in Marxist writings, as an example of the power that common people can wield once they are untied and rise for their rights.
In those days, Telangana was part of Hyderabad State. The princely state of Hyderabad (Deccan) was ruled since 18th century by monarchs called Nizams, that is, until British took over in 1857. Later on, it became part of British Crown under a system called suzerainty. As opposed to sovereignty, in suzerainty states have only limited autonomy.
Hyderabad State already had a patrimonial system of governance. Patrimonialism is a system wherein all power and authority is held by a ruler, either directly or indirectly. In Hyderabad State, among other problems, the people of Telangana suffered from a tyrannical system run in connivance with bureaucracy and feudal lords. It ultimately gave rise to the rebellion.
In English, there are a few books describing the background and the course of events that took place during what is known as Telangana rebellion. But in Urdu, there is hardly any work that comprehensively covers the rebellion. Now Syed Mazhar Jameel has published a book that determines the causes and role played by some well-known figures in organising people of Telangana in the rebellion.
Noted poet of Urdu Makhdoom Mohiuddin was one of those figures. Just published by Karachi’s Academy Bazyaft and titled Mughanni-i-Aatish Nafas and subtitled ‘Makhdoom Mohiuddin Aur Telangana Tehreek’, the book analyses the state of affairs at former princely state of Hyderabad as well as Makhdoom’s life, works and his role in the movement.
As Mazhar Jameel has mentioned, Makhdoom Mohiuddin was a poet, essayist, playwright, short story writer, political activist, trade unionist and Marxist intellectual. His real name was Abu Saeed Muhammad Makhdoom Mohiuddin Khudri and he was born on Feb 4, 1908, in a village in district Medak, Telangana. While capturing Makhdoom’s early life, his education and troubles he had to face earlier in his career, Mazhar Jameel has painted a vivid picture of Makhdoom’s bringing his personality traits to life and presenting the defining moments in the making of a poet and activist that Makhdoom was.
The author has devoted an entire longish chapter to capture the Telangana rebellion, detailing the history of lands endowed upon the feudal lords over the centuries, the plight of the starving farmers, the exploitation, communist party of India’s struggle, the progressive literature, resistance movement and the ultimate victory for the farmers after a long-drawn battle with exploiters.
A chapter narrates Makhdoom’s literary career, his early poems, his popularity, and ghazals. Makhdoom’s prose works, printing history of his books and his selected poetry have also been included in the book. An index at the back of the book, a rarity in Urdu books, makes it easier for the reader to trace certain topics.
Makhdoom Mohiuddin died on Aug 25, 1969, in Delhi, where he had gone to attend a mushaira.
Now a few words about the author, veteran scholar: Syed Mazhar Jameel’s ancestral hometown is Gurgaon, near Delhi, but he was born in Nagpur, CP, on March 9, 1936. Migrating to Pakistan in 1949 and settling in Sukkur, Sindh, Mazhar Jameel was deeply interested in social and political activities and actively participated in 1954 student movement. He did his MA (Urdu) and LL.B from Sindh University and began his law practice in Sukkur in 1973. Later on, he joined a bank in Karachi as law officer and after retirement from a senior management post, he resumed his practice.
Though deeply interested in literature and already acknowledged as a established critic having published a couple books, Mazhar Jameel shot to fame as a researcher and critic of Urdu with his notable work Aashob-i-Sindh Aur Urdu Fiction ( 2002), analysing Sindh’s political and social issues as reflected in Urdu literature.
Another remarkable work by Mazhar Sahib that won him accolades as well as awards is Jadeed Sindhi Adab: Mailanaat, Rujhanaat, Imkanaat (2007). He has to credit other works, too, that have been received quite well in literary circles include Sobhogyan Chandani: Shakhsiat-o-Fan (2007), Zikr-i-Faiz (2012), Alice Banaam Faiz (2018) and some others.
The book under review is a valuable addition to Urdu’s critical and research works as it fulfils a yawning gap about Telangana rebellion, its Marxist background and Makhdoom Mohiuddin.

1,Ejaz comes up with calculated response to Fawad’s statement,"""There will be no positive outcome of abusing or accusing people like me who believe in reconciliation,"" says PTI senator.","LAHORE: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Senator Ejaz Chaudhry has told Federal Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry that ‘abusing or accusing me’ over the issue of meeting with the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) chief will do no good to the party.
Fawad, in a TV talk show, called Ejaz’s meeting with TLP chief Saad Rizvi soon after his release from jail last month “absurd”. He also questioned why the Senator did not visit the homes of the policemen, who were martyred (during the TLP long march).
The TLP was in the spotlight after the Sialkot incident as several social media activists linked the party to the incident, though the party has distanced itself from the lynching and condemned it.
Ejaz said “there will be no positive outcome of abusing or accusing people like me who believe in reconciliation and want to keep the door open for dialogue with a social and political reality of Punjab and Pakistan”.
The Senator, who is also PTI Central Punjab president, accused the senior party leadership of not being able to finalise stronger terms with the TLP during the negotiation process and added that the PTI government was then thrown to a weaker position.
“The government then had the lesser leverage after the protesters were allowed to go on marching and blocking roads for many days leaving several policemen and civilians dead.
Senator Ejaz said extremism had been prevalent in the country for many years and was not a new phenomenon. “It has been prevalent under both civil and military governments so we should be mindful of its root causes,” he added.
He asserted that dialogue, awareness, and education rather than alienation was the best way to reduce extremism in society and this had been his sole purpose in the last three months while being part of the TLP and government negotiations as well.
He said he had strongly and unconditionally condemned the Sialkot incident since day one. He said there was no space in Islam or Pakistani constitution for taking law into their own hands. He said the PTI government under the leadership of Imran Khan would make sure that justice would be delivered.
The Senator also said Fawad made the statement (against him) for publicity gains and a few thousand Twitter likes.
Speaking to media persons, Mr Chaudhry said he had visited Saad Rizvi, who is the chief of the political party, to ensure that the ruling party should stay in contact with political parties. He said the TLP had a different past as compared to other political parties for being never in power.
Asserting that a state was responsible to keep liaison with the masses to eliminate misunderstandings and ensure peace, the Senator said he always wanted that the Government-TLP agreement should be executed in letter and spirit that eventually happened with the release of Saad Rizvi.
Though earlier he claimed that he never met any political party leader without the permission of Prime Minister Imran Khan, the Senator retracted his statement on Monday saying that he had gone to meet Saad Rizvi on his own and not on PM Khan’s orders.
Senator Chaudhry had also stated that the PTI would support TLP candidate, if his party’s candidate for NA-133 by-elections Jamshed Iqbal Cheema was disqualified by the LHC.
However, this did not happen as the TLP did not field its candidate for the by-elections held on Dec 5.

2,Zardari lauds party’s by-poll performance,LAHORE: PPP co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari has lauded the Punjab chapter of the party for showing better performance ...,"LAHORE: PPP co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari has lauded the Punjab chapter of the party for showing better performance in the NA-133 by-polls, though he was “expecting much better results”.
Speaking at a ceremony held at the Bilawal House in Bahria Town here on Monday evening to celebrate the party’s “rebirth” in Punjab capital, he said he expected Aslam Gill would bag at least 50,000 votes, but perhaps the lower turnout proved a hindrance.
Mr Zardari said electoral bouts in Punjab exposed weaknesses in the party’s strategy and helped it plan better for the next time.
He alleged that Nawaz Sharif got demarcation of constituencies on the basis of biradaris (castes) after the 1977 polls and pledged to reshape these constituencies as per the original blueprint after winning next elections.
He regretted that the PPP mandate was stolen through returning officers [in 2018].
He alleged that the PML-N was against the homeland, saying he who didn’t wish to die on the soil of the homeland could do nothing for the country (an apparent reference to Nawaz Sharif’s ‘self-exile’ in the UK).
Referring to the crises the country was facing, the former president said that he had an idea that could put the country on the path to prosperity and that it would be implemented when the party would come into power.
Punjab chapter president Raja Pervaiz Ashraf said the party
had made a dent in the stronghold of the PML-N through teamwork. Pledging to reorganise the party at ward level, he said they would immediately start preparations for the forthcoming local body polls.
General secretary Hassan Murtaza urged Mr Zardari never to look again towards Jati Umra, the residence of the Sharifs, and keep a distance from the PML-N.
Earlier, fireworks were displayed to mark the revival of the party in Lahore where over 2,500 guests were invited to a sumptuous dinner at the Bilawal House.

3,Reigniting rivalry with PML-N pays PPP dividends,"The anti-Nawaz element helped the party win back its disgruntled cadre, says PPP leader.","LAHORE: Reigniting its rivalry with the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz seems to have started paying the Pakistan Peoples Party dividends as the voters who had abandoned the PPP for reconciling with the PML-N, in the 2013 and 2018 elections have apparently returned to the party folds, as is evident from the results of the NA-133 (Lahore-XI) by-poll held last Sunday.
In the contest, the PPP bagged 32,313 votes, while the PML-N pooled 46,811 votes to retain the seat that fell vacant after the death of its MNA Pervaiz Malik and the ‘unexpected’ tally of votes the PPP secured surprised friends and foes alike.
The PPP increased its vote bank six times since the 2018 general election when it had got just 5,500 votes in the same constituency against close to 90,000 bagged by the PML-N. In fact, the PML-N’s count was more than the total number of votes the PPP had got in all 13 National Assembly constituencies of Lahore in the 2018 election.
PPP sympathisers give the credit to the revival of the party’s rivalry with the PML-N (read Nawaz Sharif), and the N-League indirectly endorses the view, saying the anti-PML-N alliance was ‘tested’ in the NA-133.
Former Punjab PPP information secretary Naveed Chaudhry says that after a long time the anti-Nawaz element was exploited, which helped the party win back its disgruntled cadre that had joined the PTI, when the PPP reconciled with the PML-N in the recent past.
The PPP’s committed anti-Zia voters came out with a vengeance this time to support the party nominee, Chaudhry Aslam Gill (considering Nawaz as a Zia remnant), he says.
Another factor, he says, is the seriousness the party showed in the electioneering as the leadership went to each nook and corner of the constituency to directly address the voters, unlike in the past when the candidate would be left to fend for himself.
Central deputy information secretary Chaudhry Munawwar Anjum says that another contributing factor was the establishment’s neutral role in the contest. He claims if the establishment maintains this neutrality in the next general election the PPP will emerge as the “most popular party” in Punjab.
He argues that the PPP’s policies of strengthening the federation through 18th amendment, securing missile technology for the national defence, providing jobs at a large scale and increasing wages of both public and private sector workers also attract the voters more than the development work by the PML-N in a limited area.
Political and financial support offered by the PPP’s Sindh chapter to Mr Gill also helped the resource-deficient candidate to match the rival party’s campaign, a leader says, requesting not to be named. He claims that co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari provided a bullet-proof vehicle and four cars painted in party colours to Mr Gill to run his campaign effectively.
A PML-N leader, however, says the forces that matter tested the anti-Nawaz alliance in the by-poll by getting the PTI candidate technically disqualified and persuading the Tehreek Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), that emerged as the third political force in Lahore in the 2018 elections, not to field its aspirant in the contest.
The Pakistan Awami Tehreek of Dr Tahirul Qadri, Majlis Wahdat-ul-Muslimeen and other anti-PML-N parties also lend their support to the PPP in the contest, he says, pointing out that the PPP also attempted to play religious card by highlighting the role of late Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in declaring Ahmadis non-Muslim.
Claiming the anti-Nawaz alliance will be widened in the Khanewal by-polls due later this month, he says the PML-N also took the Lahore challenge ‘lightly’ and neither mobilised its workers, nor generated funds for the election campaign.

Petitioner Malik Ashraf submitted that the land situation in district Sheikhupura was owned by the respondent (Nawaz Sharif) who had sold it to him (petitioner) through attorney Yousaf Abbas Sharif on May 29, 2019.
The petitioner said he had also made payment of Rs40m through a bank cheque against the land and the amount was credited to the bank account of Mr Sharif. He claimed that the respondents gave the physical possession of the land to him after receipt of the payment; however, mutation of the land under the sale deed could not be executed as he was arrested in a criminal case.
After his release from jail, the petitioner added, he filed a suit before a civil court for execution of the sale deed but it was dismissed. He prayed to the court to dismiss the civil court’s order and ask it to pass a decree in his favour.
Justice Shahid Waheed observed that the petitioner had not produced the purported land sale agreement in the civil court. The judge said mere transfer of money was not a proof of the land sale.
The judge observed that the petition appeared to be a frivolous and filed with mala fide intention. The judge dismissed the petition and also announced imposing a fine on the petitioner in his written order.

According to local sources, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf local MPA Chaudhry Masood Ahmad approved Rs70 million fund in 2021-2022 budget for the establishment of new building of Jinnah Auditorium at the place of the old one which was already demolished.
The auditorium site is located on the premises of municipal committee (MC) compound and and had no access from the main road. On the front portion of the land there is the residence of tehsildar measuring 2.5 kanals, which is a prime location near the Rest House Chowk.
As the tehsildar’s residence had been declared dangerous for residing, it is presently occupied by a clerk of the assistant commissioner’s office, Roman Hasan.
The clerk, after shifting to the residence, got constructed a boundary wall around it with the permission of former AC Arshad Watoo.
However, the sources said, after allocation of budget for the new auditorium building, present AC Sarmad Ali Bhagat kept delaying the construction work for a short while.
The sources said one month back, when Liaqatpur Municipal Committee (MC) Chairman Rashid Rafiq Chaudhary took the charge, the MPA forced him to mark the land for the new auditorium building so that the contractor could start the construction work, immediately.
The sources said the MPA also requested RYK Deputy Commissioner (DC), Nauman Yousuf and AC Bhagat for getting the land vacated, but the officers did not bother.
On Dec 2, 2021, the MPA, and the chairman, in the presence of dozens of councillors allegedly got the boundary wall of the clerk’s house.
AC Bhagat and city DSP Ghulam Dastgir immediately reached the spot and stopped the demolition of wall.
Next day, a delegation of the All Pakistan Clerks Association (APCA) moved a written complaint to the DC against the demolition of their colleague’s house’s wall at the behest of the MPA. Following the complaint, the house’s boundary wall was again constructed by the MPA’s man, but a two kanal front portion of the land was excluded from it.
Later, MPA Masood also wrote a letter to Punjab chief minister, alleging the AC was involved in hatching conspiracies against the PTI government.
DC Nauman Yousuf told Dawn that the tehsildar’s residence land was owned by Punjab government and there was a proper procedure to get the state land for any public project.
He said the MC should follow the procedure and write a letter to Punjab government to get the land for the construction of auditorium.
MPA Masood did not reply to the calls made by this scribe for his version.
Sources said that the construction of auditorium was just a pretext to possess the land on the prime location, which might be latter put to commercial use by the MC.

Since police have reportedly asked Rajkot garments factory management to avoid talking to media till investigation, Dawn talked to a local businessman who has been closely associated with the owners.
He told Dawn that he had plenty of interactions with the deceased manager in the factory he joined in 2012 after serving in the textile mills of Faisalabad for a couple of years.

It will be launched in coordination with the departments of wildlife and fisheries to promote tourism, particularly the desert safari in Cholistan during winter.
To start with preliminary measures for the establishment of the safari park, the forest department has finalised arrangements to shift about 200 black bucks to a new enclosure raised on an area of 230 acres with an improved habitat.
Lal Sohanra District Forest Officer Ijaz Ahmed Tabbasum told Dawn the Wildlife Secretary Shahid Zaman inspected the arrangements the other day. He said the project would cost about Rs 120 million.
Elaborating, the DFO said presently the ratio of the black bucks in the existing enclosures was 1:1, which was not conducive to their nourishment there. He said it was necessary to shift about 125 out of total 500 black bucks’ present strength to in the new enclosure to ensure 1:5 ratio in accordance with international standards.
He said after keeping the black bucks in the new enclosure, they could be released in the proposed safari park. He said the safari park, stretched over an area of about one 100,000 acres, would also have the Chinkara deer, blue bulls and peacocks for the attraction of visitors.

A senior official of UoG said the issue had surfaced due to the shortage of vehicles as the contractor firm had engaged its buses somewhere else due to the prolonged closure of campuses during the Covid-19 lockdown and he could not bring the required number of vehicles back to the university. He added that though the exact fleet of the contractor should be of at least 50 vehicles in addition to the university’s own 43 buses and vans but there is a shortage of at least 15 vehicles.
Another source told Dawn that the UoG had enrolled extra students in recent admissions and it had not made the required arrangements to cater to the needs of the students, particularly regarding the transportation and hostels, since the commencement of the classes last week.
It is pertinent to mention that the UoG has been providing the pick and drop facility to all of its students for which it charges fee from each student whether he/she availed the facility or not.
About the issue, UoG Vice Chancellor Professor Dr Shabbar Atiq said the transport firm had brought 38 vehicles instead of total 50 and he had talked to the contractor to meet the vehicles shortage. He said the varsity had received record number of admission applications this time and added it had got two new academic blocks last year, providing enough space for students. At least 7,000 students were enrolled in the university this time as compared to the previous figures of 4,000, he added.
Mr Atiq said he had directed the officials to stop students of fifth and seventh semesters from coming to the campus yet, claiming that the issue would be resolved when the contractor would complete the fleet of buses.
For hostel facilities, the UoG has approached some private hostels to accommodate the students.

LAHORE: As many as 12 under-trial prisoners having criminal record escaped from the Model Town district courts lock-up despite presence of police here on Monday.
Some of the under-trial prisoners who escaped form the district courts poorly managed lock-up after rioting are facing serious charges, including drug supply, robbery and theft.
Initial reports said the inmates demolished a wall of a washroom in the lock-up and used its bricks to break open the lock of its central gate and escaped.
As per sources, the rioting erupted when the police allegedly refused to allow the relatives of some prisoners to supply food and other items to them.

IGP suspends prisoners escort DSP

A footage of the incident showed presence of several armed police personnel there when the inmates were fleeing the judicial lock-up.
The CCTV footage showed the prisoners brought from different jails abusing the policemen, throwing furniture and other objects on them and trying to get out of the judicial lock-up.
The police personnel standing there could be seen in the footage acting like silent spectators or making halfhearted attempts to thwart the prisoners’ bid to escape.
The incident not only exposed the low morale of the police force, but also their poor training and capacity to check such incidents.
On being informed of the situation, a high-alert was issued by the police authorities in the city, and additional force was dispatched to the scene to maintain law and order.
Besides setting up additional police pickets in various parts of the provincial capital, the barriers at the entry and exit points were fortified by deputing extra force there to nab the fleeing prisoners.
Official record shows that a total of 166 prisoners were brought for hearing of their cases in prison vans from the two major prisons of Lahore -- Kot Lakhpat and Central Jail -- to the Model Town courts.
The witnesses said the prisoners were kept in the judicial lock-up on the district courts premises before presenting them before judges for hearing of criminal cases lodged against them.
They said suddenly a scuffle broke out among some of the inmates, prompting a policeman to unlock the judicial lock-up to end the brawl.
Meanwhile, they said, the fighting inmates broke the wooden chairs and tables placed in the lock-up and threw the parts of broken furniture on the police personnel while hurling abuses at them.
A footage of the incident also showed the prisoners using the broken furniture as ‘weapon’ to shoo away the armed police personnel, who seemed reluctant to go near the lock-up.
Lahore Operations SSP Mustansar Feroz told Dawn that minor scuffles among prisoners inside the judicial lock-up was a routine, but the situation turned serious on Monday when the inmates attacked the police and escaped.
He said the prisoners took advantage of the negligence of some of the policemen on duty, who had been suspended from service.
“One of the fleeing prisoners was nabbed by the police on the spot, while two others have been arrested from Chungi Amar Sidhu and Ghalib Market, respectively”, he said.
Mr Feroz said the inmates who fled the lock-up were allegedly involved in robbery, theft and illegal weapons and none of them was accused of murder.
He said initial investigations showed the unrest sparked when some jail officials and police personnel disallowed the prisoners’ relatives to provide them mobile phones and other items which were banned as per the standard operating procedure (SOPs).
He said several police teams formed by the higher authorities had been dispatched for the arrest of the fleeing under-trial prisoners.
Meanwhile, Punjab Inspector General of Police Rao Sardar Ali Khan has suspended from service Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Prisoners Escort, Lahore, in the wake of escape of the under-trial prisoners.
He sought a detailed report from the Lahore capital city police officer on the incident and also ordered a departmental inquiry into the episode to fix responsibility for negligence.
Mr Khan directed the CCPO to ensure arrest of all the fleeing prisoners as soon as possible and bring them to justice.
He also directed review of the security arrangements at district courts to prevent such incident in future.

An anti-terrorism court had awarded the appellant, Dawar Khan, one-year imprisonment in a case registered by the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD). He was accused of raising funds for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Representing the appellant, Advocate Mian Dawood argued that the trial court sentenced his client on mere assumptions as the prosecution had not produced even a single evidence against him.
He said the prosecution had also not presented the report of a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) during the trial. The whole evidence of the prosecution relied upon an unverified “receipt book” allegedly used by the appellant to collect funds for the banned outfit, Mian Daood said.
After hearing the arguments, a division bench headed by Justice Chaudhry Abdul Aziz allowed the appeal and acquitted the appellant.
