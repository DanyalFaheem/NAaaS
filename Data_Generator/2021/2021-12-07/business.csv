0,Senate committee orders FBR to withdraw new property valuations,Directs consultation with stakeholders for issuing revised tables.,"ISLAMABAD:  A parliamentary panel on Monday ordered withdrawal of 100-700 per cent increase in valuation of immovable properties in the country’s 40 urban centres for the purpose of tax collection notified by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) on Dec 1.
On the basis of observations of the senators and protest by real estate stakeholders, Senator Talha Mahmood of JUI while presiding over the meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue also directed the FBR to come up with a revised valuation table in consultation with all the stakeholders within 15 days.

Directs consultation with stakeholders for issuing revised tables

He said it was inappropriate on part of the revenue authorities to take steps without taking relevant stakeholders in confidence and such policies were neither in the interest of the businesses nor the FBR itself. He said business transactions required time to materialise and hence there should also be a mechanism and time frame under which the deals finalised before the new SRO remain unaffected.
The decision-making should be based on involvement of stakeholders but economic improvement and revenue growth could not be expected when there was trust deficit between the government agencies and the stakeholders.
The committee directed that during the consultation process for a new mechanism, previous regulation and arrangements should be put in place so that businesses can run as usual. For all the future regulations the FBR should provide ample time to the industry for compliance and adjust their businesses accordingly.
FBR Chairman Dr Ashfaq Ahmad told the committee that the objective of the revised valuation of the properties was to gradually tax immovable properties on the basis of market prices. He said until few years ago there was no proper system of real valuation of properties and the provinces were not ready to reach a consensus. Therefore, the FBR was entrusted with the responsibility. He said the property prices set for the first time during the government of PML-N and a tax amnesty scheme was also offered on the basis of these prices.
He said the FBR had set best possible property evaluation in the given circumstances but there was still possibility that valuations for some areas may be higher or lower and hence the FBR was ready to review these valuation tables.
Senator Kamil Ali Agha of PML-Q said there was no proper mechanism for property valuations but it was not possible for the parliament to rubber stamp whatever the government comes up with. 
He suggested that there should be some formula and independent assessment of values to ensure a fair property valuation and resultant taxation.
Senator Saleem Mandviwalla observed that some way forward should be looked into instead of criticising the tax machinery. He said the FBR had been setting values of properties since the PPP tenure and there was a need for a national consensus on the subject.
Senator Faisal Sabzwari of MQM said the committee did not want to destroy the property business but also could not allow black money to be invested in the property market.
The representatives of property dealers and Rawalpindi and Islamabad Chambers of Commerce and Industries  said the FBR had imposed new valuation tables without taking them into confidence and all of a sudden, resulting in a complete halt on property transactions. They said the people had signed sale purchase contracts but were shocked at the time of transfer that their tax rates had increased by 100 to 700pc.
They also pointed out that no transaction could be actualised since the SROs were issued on Dec 1 and some property valuations were so absurd that the customers were ready to sell their assets at less than half the evaluated price to the government.

3,"Supply to CNG stations in Punjab, KP halted as winter bites",SNGPL’s decision aimed at meeting the increasing demand of over six million domestic consumers.,"LAHORE: Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) suspended the gas supply to compressed natural gas (CNG) stations across Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Monday for an indefinite period in a bid to meet the increasing demand of over six million domestic consumers. 
The CNG sector has taken exception to the SNGPL’s decision, describing the suspension of gas as an illegal act.   On the other hand, domestic users in some areas of Punjab and KP have started facing a gas shortage as the temperature falls, with many service areas in major cities, especially the tail-end ones, experiencing low gas pressure. Besides, a few areas are experiencing low gas pressure due to the use of compressors by some domestic consumers to extract gas. 
“The suspension of gas supply to CNG stations in Punjab and KP for an indefinite period under a 17-year-old policy is an illegal act.” All Pakistan CNG Association’s group leader Ghayas Piracha told Dawn, adding that suspending gas in KP was also a contempt of court. 
“The Gas Load Management Policy of 2005 had been enforced for a period of two years only. But the authorities concerned intentionally concealed this from the federal cabinet,” Mr Piracha claimed. 

SNGPL’s decision aimed at meeting the increasing demand of over six million domestic consumers

He said that since CNG stations across the two provinces used to get regasified liquefied natural gas instead of the indigenous or system gas, the policy is not applicable for the CNG sector. “Whenever the gas shortage emerges, we become the first to be hit,” he said, urging the federal government to take notice of the situation. 
On the other hand, the domestic consumers in tail-end areas or those bearing the brunt of the compressor use by people living in the vicinity started experiencing extremely low gas pressure. “Whenever the winter starts, the gas supply squeezes, leaving us with no option but to use expensive LPG [liquefied petroleum gas] cylinders to keep our home routine intact,” said Saeed, a resident of Lahore’s Sahowari neighbourhood. 
Anwar, a resident of the Township area, lamented that despite having low gas supply in winter, the consumers continued to face higher bills. 
A spokesman for the SNGPL told Dawn that since domestic consumers were a top priority, the company was liable to provide them with gas first and then others under a merit order. 
“We have diverted 100 million standard cubic feet per day (mmcfd) of gas meant for the CNG sector to domestic consumers to meet their increasing demand that has now reached to around 700 mmcfd,” he explained. “The domestic sector’s demand will increase further in December and January and is expected to reach 1,200 to 1,300 mmcfd during peak winter.” 
The spokesman admitted that the tail-end areas, especially the northern areas of Lahore, and those areas where consumers use compressors to extract gas are in trouble. “A single domestic consumer uses gas of nearly 30 houses if they use compressor,” he said.

4,"Most CPEC projects complete, says Chinese envoy",Urges Pakistani industrialists to take advantage of the free trade agreement between the two countries.,"KARACHI: Chinese Consul General Li Bijian on Monday said that most of the projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) have been completed while Gwadar has become more important in the region.  
China has invested in various projects including the airport, training centre and Gwadar, the envoy said during a visit to the office of Korangi Association of Trade and Industry (Kati).  
“I am happy that the power crisis in Pakistan has ended due to CPEC. The development work of Gwadar Airport is 90 per cent complete and hopefully operations will begin in 2023,” the envoy said, according to a press release issued by Kati.  
The diplomat said a hospital was also being constructed in Gwadar which was expected to become functional next year.  
CPEC is an important part of the Pak-China friendship, he highlighted.  
The envoy stressed that there were ample trade opportunities in China for Pakistani industrialists and investors. “China has a population of 500 million middle-class people which could be a big market for Pakistan,” he added.  
He said that Pakistan could export fruits and vegetables to China, while China has a larger seafood market of which Pakistani exporters could take full advantage. 
In addition, cooperation between the two countries in the field of IT and electric vehicles could be further enhanced. 
The Chinese envoy said the two countries could work out a strategy to increase Pakistan’s export volume through trade. 
He urged Pakistani industrialists to take advantage of the free trade agreement between the two countries. 
Kati President Salman Aslam said the economic corridor project was important for the economy of both the countries.  
Former Kati president Danish Khan said that Chinese investors should set up industries in Pakistan and stressed on the need for holding joint trade fairs with China to promote Pakistani products.

5,NSS outflows reduce govt’s borrowing options,"On a net basis, the NSS recorded an outflow of Rs78.88 billion during the July-October period.","KARACHI:  The outflows from the National Savings Schemes (NSS) continued during the  first four months of 2021-22 mainly due to a ban on institutions  to invest in these schemes.
As a result, the government’s  opti­ons to get higher amount of liquidity have reduced, particularly when it cannot borrow money from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) under an IMF  agreement.
The  SBP data on Monday showed that on a net basis the NSS recorded an outflow of Rs78.88 billion during the July-October period against an inflow of Rs24.84bn in the same period last year. Subsequently, the NSS witnessed an outflow of Rs317.3bn in 2020-21 against a net investment of Rs370.9bn a year ago.
Savers pulled out Rs6.8bn in October, Rs21bn in September, Rs24.8bn in August and the highest Rs26bn in July.
The inflows started declining after the federal government on the recommendation of the SBP discontinued institutional investments in the NSS from July 1, 2020. Following the offer of exceptionally high (and  above market returns), the NSS attracted significant  investment before the ban on institutional investments.  
A report of the SBP said that the higher rates of return led to a number  of problems, such as a sharp rise in the government cost of financing  its deficit  as the instruments were available ‘on tap’, the flows were  not predictable and made the government funding cost volatile. The  inherent volatility in these flows and consequent uncertainty over the  government funding requirement from the banking system added difficulty  in formulating stable monetary policies.
The report said the administered nature of NSS profit rates was a major  source of distortion in the term structure of interest rates; as these  instruments were not traded (ie price discovery was not possible),  these did not form benchmarks for corporate debt; and finally the  implicit put option (the bonds could be substituted at any time) meant  that corporate issues would have to be priced at much higher yields to  compete with NSS instruments. 
“In effect, this ensured that the domestic debt market would remain moribund,” said the SBP. The  same situation emerged in 1990s and the then government initiated NSS reforms and barred all types of institutional investments in NSS in March 2000.
“Indeed  even the limited reforms of the late 1990s and early 2000 have  not been sustained. Instead, the government chose to increase the  non-bank borrowing by removing the restriction on institutional  investment in NSS,” said the SBP report.
