0,"More plastic roads to be built in Islamabad, other cities, says Rashid",Around one km-long patch of Ataturk Avenue in Islamabad carpeted with plastic mixed bitumen.,"ISLAMABAD: Plastic will be used to construct roads in the federal capital and other cities as this concept is environment-friendly.
Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid said on Monday while inaugurating the first ever plastic road project, under which a patch of 1km-long road of Ataturk Avenue was carpeted with plastic mixed bitumen.
The minister appreciated the Capital Development Authority (CDA) Chairman Amer Ali Ahmed and other partners for coming up with the idea. The inauguration ceremony was attended by students and environment-friendly people. A ceremonial walk was also arranged.

The project, for which 10 tonnes of plastic bottles were utilised, has been implemented jointly by Coca-Cola, National Incubation Centre and CDA. It must be noted that several countries of the world have already constructed a number of plastic roads.
According to the beverage company, the use of plastic to make roads is a global practice and these roads are more durable. The objective of the project is to protect the environment, but if scaled up to other roads in rural areas, urban centres and national highways, the positive impact on both development and the environment will be on a large scale, not cosmetic.
CDA Chairman Amer Ali Ahmed told Dawn that before carpeting the road, CDA and its partners conducted a trial in F-9 Park which was successful.
He said Islamabad produced around 700 tonnes of waste daily including around 150 tonnes of plastic waste. “In the future, we will use plastic waste for the good purpose of using in roads. This step will not only help CDA reduce cost of the roads but above all it will help to reduce pollution,” he added.
CDA Director Omer Sagheer said under the new formula,10 kgs plastic is used for 42kg bitumen, adding that these roads have good marshal stability value than bitumen roads and also have good penetration value and durability.
Speaking to Dawn, Professor of Environmental Sciences at the International Islamic University Islamabad Dr Mohammad Irfan Khan appreciated inauguration of the project.
He said these roads are imperative to reduce dust, which has been a source of poor air quality.
“We have the worst air quality so plastic roads will be helpful to reduce dust so air quality can be improved. Whereas, plastic waste has badly hit streams, rivers and other water sources. It also affects soil fertility. I would say, the government should carpet maximum number of roads under plastic mixed bitumen to control dust pollution”, he said.
Earlier, Coca Cola’s representatives including vice president Fahad Ashraf and Pervez Abbasi from National Incubation Centre also shed light on the project.

4,Senate committee okays amended bill on protection against workplace harassment of women,"New law suggests stricter punishments for offenders, binds courts to decide cases in 90 days.","ISLAMABAD: The Senate Standing Committee on Human Rights on Monday approved the Protection against Harassment of Women at Workplace (Amendment) Bill 2021, suggesting stricter punishments to the offenders, including more premises in the definition of a workplace and binding courts to decide such cases in 90 days.
The committee members reviewed the bill clause-by-clause and after getting input from woman activists and law experts agreed to include their recommendations in some of the clauses that had been moved by Minister for Human Rights Dr Shireen Mazari.
Briefing the committee, the minister said in the previous act the definitions of an employee, a workplace and harassment were narrow. In the proposed bill, she said, they had tried to expand the definitions in order to make the law more effective.
PPP Senator Sherry Rehman identified some loopholes in the amendments and asked for addressing them. She conceded that the previous law was not finding resolution to some matters due to the narrow definitions.
The committee members finally passed the bill which will now go back to the Senate for final approval.
The protection of women participating in sports and working online has also been made part of the proposed law. Besides, the scope of the law has been expanded to universities and art studios. Moreover, harassment of women working in houses will also be a crime under the proposed law.
The bill has suggested that a government employee found involved in harassment can be punished with dismissal and suspension of promotion whereas those involved in professional fields will have their licences revoked.
Gender-based discrimination would also be a punishable offence under the new law. If passed by parliament, courts will have to decide harassment petitions within 90 days.
According to the statement of objects and reasons attached to the bill, the proposed law “aims to facilitate increased participation of women in the workforce by removing the lacuna present in the existing law. It broadens the ambit and scope of the law to include certain professions and employment models that the current law does not expressly mention.”
Through these amendments, it says, that protection from harassment shall be provided to people engaged in all types of formal and informal work. The amendment bill will also provide clarity with respect to different kinds of harassment that take place at the workplace.
The purpose of this amendment is to fulfil Pakistan’s constitutional obligations to its citizens and guarantee them their dignity and prevention of discrimination on the basis of sex in their professions and achieve the goal of increased women participation in the workplace.
Resolution condemns Sialkot tragedy
At the outset of the meeting, on the proposal of committee chairman Walid Iqbal, the members observed one-minute silence and passed a resolution to pay homage to the Sri Lankan citizen who became a victim of mob lynching last week in Sialkot.
Through the resolution, the committee “expressed its profound grief and sorrow over the sad demise of Sri Lankan citizen Priyantha Kumara Diyawadana in Sialkot on December 3, 2021, and extends its sincere condolences and regrets to the family of the deceased as well as to the government and people of Sri Lanka.
“The committee condemns the vigilantism and the brutality involved on part of the violent mob that perpetrated this gruesome crime and calls upon all institutions of the state to ensure that these perpetrators are punished with the full might of the law, and also to conduct some soul searching followed by taking of concrete steps towards preventing the society’s descent into intolerant radicalisation,” it stated.

Mr Haq said the society had also provided over 19,000 hygiene kits to communities in 16 districts of Pakistan.
“Moreover, 262 hand sanitising booths and 458 hand washing stations have been installed at different public locations to promote good hygiene practices to limit the spread of the disease.

After chairing a meeting of the subcommittee, the senator said all 390 schools in Islamabad were closed for the last one week in protest against the government decision to place the institutions under the local government through a presidential ordinance.
He said it was unfortunate that the government instead of holding a debate in parliament issued the ordinance and placed the schools under the local government. He said the ordinance should be amended in greater interest of the education sector.
“We are going to take up this issue in the main committee meeting to be held on Tuesday. This is a highly important issue as all schoolchildren are sitting in homes and their teachers are protesting against the ordinance,” he said.
It may be noted that the teaching and non-teaching staff after rejecting the ordinance have gone on a strike. They said they would not resume work until the government withdraws its decision. They said schools should remain part of the education ministry as the local government had no capacity to deal with the sector.
Earlier, during the meeting, the subcommittee showed its displeasure over reported cases of plagiarism by several educationists. The committee also took up a complaint of a Pakistani professor teaching in Australia who accused the vice chancellor of a university in Pakistan of copying his research articles.
The committee asked the Higher Education Commission (HEC) to come up with details of journals being published by five major universities of the country and actions and steps taken to stop the practice of plagiarism. The committee decided to take up the matter at its next meeting.
“Plagiarism is academic dishonesty and HEC and universities will have to play their role to stop this practice,” the convener said.
Senator Rukhsana Zuberi said the committee will play its role to help HEC overcome the plagiarism issue.

ISLAMABAD: President Dr Arif Alvi on Monday said Pakistan’s increasing vulnerability to climate change required urgent action on the management of water resources and for an improved system of its conservation at the national and local levels.
Addressing an international conference in connection with ‘Pakistan Water Week’, the president said it was the responsibility of both the government and citizens to save water through resilient and sustainable solutions.
The conference, ‘Needs for sustainable water management in a climate crisis for the Indus Basin’ was organised by the Ministry of Science and Technology through the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR), International Water Management Institute (IWMI) and CGIARs Water, Land and Ecosystems Programme.
President Alvi said climate change was the key factor affecting the reliability of water resources and raising concerns about the future of water availability in countries including Pakistan.
He emphasised practices to reduce water consumption, including drip irrigation instead of flood farming, water recycling and reallocating water for more valuable uses.
Dr Alvi said the government had made solid progress in achieving key principles defined under the national water policy and called for an integrated approach among provinces for its complete implementation.
Federal Minister for Science and Technology Senator Shibli Faraz said water conservation and management was an issue of major concern for the government. He said managing the vast resources of Himalayan glaciers and the country’s fourth largest aquifer was a big challenge to restore the ecosystem for the benefit of people.
Simi Kamal, member IWMI board of governors, said IWMI was providing assistance to the government through data analytics for making choices about agricultural water management, develop water solutions and policy development.
IWMI Director General Mark Smith said Pakistan was facing critical water challenges and said expressed confidence that the event would catalyse dialogue on the urgency for water security in view of the diminishing water resources. He suggested effective and coherent water governance from federal to community levels, guidance from data and digital information and experimenting diversity in water systems through nature-based solutions.
Digitalisation of economy
President Alvi said digitalisation of the economy was essential to empower women and bring other deprived segments into the mainstream.
Addressing the plenary session of the 24th ‘Sustainable development conference’ here, the president said the disbursement of cash to women under Ehsaas programme directly to their bank accounts would make them more financially empowerment.
He said banks had also introduced schemes for women to make them establish their own businesses which would ultimately make them play a constructive role in the society.
He lauded the society’s support as well as the government’s policy of smart lockdown and data-driven decisions to support the poor and economy which saved the people as well as the economy.
President Alvi said the Covid-19 pandemic provided an opportunity to promote online learning which the nation could not adopt earlier despite availability of tools.
He said think-tanks like Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI), the organiser of the conference, should identify new trends and exploit them.

10,Pakistan hopeful of winning IMO executive council seat,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is vying for the slot at International Maritime Organisation (IMO) executive council, expecting...","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is vying for the slot at International Maritime Organisation (IMO) executive council, expecting to be elected in recognition of the services rendered for seafarers in line with IMO’s guidelines.
Pakistan became a member of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) in 1958. Being among the few pioneering members of IMO, Pakistan has served as an elected council member five times--1977, 1979, 1987, 1989 and 1991.
However, the country lost the contest in 2006, but the ministry of maritime affairs is hopeful to grab the slot due to the country’s performance during the Covid-19 pandemic.
“In the extremely testing times during the pandemic when the entire global community bore the onslaught of Covid-19, Pakistan’s response was exemplary,” Maritime Affairs Minister Ali Zaidi told Dawn.
Pakistan is a candidate for Category C in the upcoming elections being held on Dec 10.
In line with IMO’s guidelines and in recognition of the valuable services of the seafarers, Government of Pakistan had declared seafarers as “Key Workers”, and seamless operations continued at the ports of country and marine transportation from medical supplies including lifesaving vaccines to food commodities.
Pakistan efficiently put into place procedures and processes to ensure that trade continued despite the unprecedented circumstances.
Pakistan also successfully managed to continue uninterrupted safe operations at its ports without any closures facilitating safe change of crew from foreign going vessels.
Currently, Pakistan plans to expand its maritime footprint by playing an active role at the IMO, as the country has already achieved certain milestones in ensuring lowest possible carbon footprint at the ports, it believes in a collective effort to achieve the net zero targets.
The minister said that after becoming part of the IMO council for Category C this year, Pakistan hopes to be the part of the decision-making platform to mutually devise implementation strategies and come up with tangible solutions to ensure knowledge sharing and transferring of technology for all member states.
“A global effort to ensure Zero-carbon technology and fuels must be made available worldwide, and at an affordable price especially for the developing nations,” he added.
“As a responsible maritime nation, Pakistan reaffirms its commitments towards the adoption and implementation of the highest maritime standards,” the minister said.
Pakistan also strongly endorses the idea of ‘IMO Maritime Research Fund’ and appreciates all the nations that signed the Clyde Bank Declaration for Green Shipping Corridors recently at COP26 last month, he said.
Pakistan has reaffirmed its commitment towards the adoption and implementation of the highest maritime standards, he added.
Mr Zaidi added the concept of Blue Economy has been the centre of the present government’s agenda and therefore the year 2020 was declared the year of Blue Economy by Prime Minister Imran Khan.
Pakistan’s Certificate of Competence (CoC) is recognised internationally, having signed MOUs with 29 nations for the certificate of recognition under the latest provisions of Standards of Training, Certification and Watch keeping
Under a national plan, the Pakistan government administered free of cost Covid-19 vaccination to all seafarers and their families.
Further, the Pakistan government is administering free of cost Covid-19 vaccination to all international seafarers, who are calling on the three ports of Pakistan.
