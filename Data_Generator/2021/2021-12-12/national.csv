2,Lecturer moves LHC against conviction over leaked call to PAF pilot,The lecturer had congratulated his former student for shooting down the Indian fighter plane flown by Abhinandan Varthaman.,"• Petitioner was court-martialled under Section 71 of PAF Act
• Contends LHC can invoke constitutional jurisdiction     
ISLAMABAD: A civilian lecturer of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) has petitioned before the Lahore High Court (LHC), Rawalpindi bench, to set aside his conviction over a leaked call with a pilot — one of his former students — in which he congratulated him for shooting down the Indian fighter plane flown by Abhinandan Varthaman. 
Indian Air Force pilot Varthaman, who was captured by Pakistan in 2019 after his MiG-21 Bison aircraft was shot down by a PAF jet, was recently awarded the Vir Cha­kra — the third-highest wartime gallantry award after Param Vir Chakra and Maha Vir Chakra — by the Indian government. 
The petitioner, Hafiz Farooq Ahmed Khan who was working at PAF College Lower Topa, Murree, faced court martial after his telephonic conversation with the PAF pilot went viral on social media. 
As per details of the case, Khan was recruited as a civilian lecturer in PAF College in June 1999 through the Federal Public Service Commission (FPSC). 
He was charged and subsequently convicted by the Court Martial under the provisions of the Official Secrets Act, 1923. 
In his petition, Mr Khan stated that on the evening of Feb 27, 2019, he and his wife were watching television at his official residence in PAF College, Lower Topa.  
While watching the news about two Indian aircraft being shot down by the PAF during a standoff between the two countries, Mr Khan called up his old student, who was an air force fighter pilot, to congratulate him, the petition added. 
It stated that the call lasted two minutes and 27 seconds, during which Mr Khan exchanged congratulatory remarks with the pilot, who stated on his own, without being questioned by the petitioner, that whatever was being shown on media was not even 30pc and that there had been 350 casualties on ground. 
The petition then explained how the call got leaked and went viral on social media. 
Mr Khan admitted in the plea that he had forwarded the same call to 61 of his relatives and friends out of sheer excitement and pride and to highlight PAF spirit.  “Ultimately, the said call went viral on social media and was noticed/detected by the Air Intelligence Agency of PAF,” he said. 
The teacher was held on July 8, 2019 and was court-martialled on four charges under Section 71 of the PAF Act, 1953. He was accused of committing an offence for a purpose prejudicial to the safety or interest of the State, while having conversation…recorded information about PAF Air Operations, which might directly or indirectly be useful to an enemy, “unauthorised possession of document/information”, “failed to take reasonable care of the same resulting into leakage of the said information on social media” and unauthorised dissemination of air operations to over 60 contacts. 
During the court martial proceedings, Khan pleaded “not guilty” following which the prosecution recorded the evidence of 11 witnesses and presented certain documents while in his defence the teacher produced his wife and four other witnesses. 
Khan was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment of two years and eight months vide by the Field General Court Martial. The base commander remitted the sentence by eight months and reduced it to 24 months. 
The petitioner then filed an appeal before the PAF Appellate Tribunal that further remitted the sentence by one year and two months. 
He contended that since there was no alternative forum available for review, the LHC could invoke the constitutional jurisdiction of Article 199 to administer justice.

3,"PML-N says its target is Imran govt, not PPP","“We will not react to whatever statements Zardari sahib gives (against the PML-N leadership),” Ahsan Iqbal says.","LAHORE: The PML-N has made it clear that its target is not the PPP rather its main objective is to get rid of Prime Minister Imran Khan and seek fresh polls. 
In the wake of recent bickering between the PML-N and PPP leadership over the NA-133 by-poll, PML-N secretary general Ahsan Iqbal maintained that his party did not want any confrontation with other opposition parties, including the PPP.

“Let me make it clear that the PPP is not our target. Our target is Imran Khan Niazi, his fake system and seeking fresh and fair elections,” Mr Iqbal told a presser at the party’s provincial headquarters in Model Town here on Saturday. “We will not react to whatever statements Zardari sahib gives (against the PML-N leadership).” 

Ahsan Iqbal asks PM to disclose details of gifts from foreign heads of state and explain nominal income tax he’s paying

A couple of days ago, PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif had advised PPP Co-Chairman Asif Ali Zardari not to target former premier Nawaz Sharif. Mr Zardari, during his visit to Lahore in connection with the NA-133 by-poll, had taunted Nawaz, saying: “Those who do not wish to die in their homeland can do nothing for the country.” 
Reacting to the statement, PML-N leader Tallal Chaudhry, who is considered close to Maryam Nawaz, made some disparaging comments about PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, while party MNA Ali Pervaiz Malik, the son of winning candidate from NA-133 Shaista Pervaiz, also used harsh language about the PPP leadership. 
Mr Chaudhry, however, on the directions of the party leadership regretted his choice of words about the PPP leadership in a video statement. 
The PPP is of the view that the PML-N leadership has panicked after seeing its (PPP) comeback performance in NA-133. PPP’s Chaudhry Aslam Gill secured over 32,000 votes against PML-N’s Shaista Pervaiz, who bagged 46,000.

Continuing to take on the premier, the PML-N secretary general said: “Imran Niazi is running the foreign policy similar to that of former US president Donald Trump. Niazi, being arrogant and vindictive, can never become a statesman.” 
Ahsan Iqbal also asked the prime minister to tell people about the gifts he received from foreign heads of state. “The embezzlement of gifts received by Imran Khan from foreign states is earning Pakistan a bad name. Being sadiq and ameen, the titles he received from former chief justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar, Imran should not hesitate to provide the list of gifts,” he demanded and asked Mr Khan to provide receipts of the foreign funding. 
Earlier, on a petition, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) had questioned the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government over its “reluctance to disclose” details of the gifts presented to Prime Minister Imran Khan since he assumed office in August 2018. 
Mr Iqbal also asked PM Khan to tell people why he was paying nominal income tax despite living in a 300-kanal palatial house in Banigala. “Who is affording the expenditures of his house?” he questioned, adding that the answer lied in the PM allegedly allowing mafias to operate with impunity and make money in sugar, flour, medicines and other areas. 
“Imran Niazi has given himself and his cronies NRO [relief, in reference to the National Reconciliation Ordinance] through ordinances to manipulate the accountability system so that in the future no one can lay hands on him and his ministers for their corruption,” he said, alleging that Imran Khan had destroyed the economy and his inability to govern could be seen in every sector. 
“In the three-year rule of the PTI, the [China-Pakistan Economic Corridor] projects have been destroyed,” he lamented. 
The former interior minister further asked the head of Rangers to take note of its personnel ‘manhandling’ PML-N workers and him in Karachi. “Imran Niazi used the Rangers for his politics. The image of the state institution has been tarnished through this act. The head of the institution should look into this matter as to why it was used for political purposes,” he demanded. 
Mr Iqbal also asked the premier to visit Gwadar to redress the grievances of the locals who had been protesting for several days.
