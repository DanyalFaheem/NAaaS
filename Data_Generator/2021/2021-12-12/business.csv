0,Key conditions to obtain loans from microfinance banks withdrawn,The move is aimed at enhancing the role of microfinance banks in accelerating economic activities.,"KARACHI:  In a major move to facilitate small borrowers, the State Bank of  Pakistan (SBP) on Saturday withdrew the requirements of written declarations and a credit information report for obtaining loans from  the microfinance banks (MFBs).
The SBP has introduced the changes to the prudential  regulations for MFBs to streamline the requirement of obtaining  Credit Information Report (CIR) and simplifying the documentary  requirements from microfinance borrowers.
The move is aimed at enhancing the role of MFBs in accelerating economic activities and creating bigger opportunities for small borrowers. Earlier,  the MFBs were required to obtain written declarations from borrowers about  facilities already obtained by them from other financial institutions. 
“However,  as Licensed Credit Bureaus (LCBs) are able to offer comprehensive CIR  on individuals/borrowers, therefore in order to avoid duplication, this  requirement has been withdrawn,”  the SBP said. “This would bring  efficiency and further simplify the loan approval process by reducing  documentary requirements from borrowers.”
The microfinance industry is facing many challenges like inadequate  regulatory frame­work, ad hoc competitiveness, lack of innovative and  diversified products, profitability, market stability, limited  management capacity of microfinance institutions (MFIs).
Both  the SBP and the government believe that the MFBs could help to eradicate the rising unemployment and poverty by offering attractive microfinance package  for increasing employment and income. This  could provide the basis for this sector to stimulate the growth of the economy,  empower women, increase the volume of finances and facilitate  accessibility, etc.  
Similarly, MFBs were earlier required to  obtain a mandatory credit report from SBP’s eCIB for all credit facilities  exceeding Rs30,000. 
“Since LCBs are able to offer comprehensive  CIR to its members which constitutes of almost all banks and MFBs and  Non-Bank Microfinance Companies (NBMFCs), therefore, the mandatory  requirement to make an inquiry from SBP’s eCIB has been withdrawn,” said  the circular.
This revision will allow MFBs to independently decide on obtaining CIR of borrowers, regardless of loan size, it added.
The  MFBs obligation towards reporting to SBP’s eCIB has also been  simplified besides aligning relevant terminologies with the Credit  Bureaus Act, 2015, said the SBP.
The MFBs remained market leaders  and witnessed an increase in their market share in terms of active  borrowers from 48 per cent in the prior year to 50pc by the end  of 2019.
Earlier, the Credit Bureau Act (CBA) 2015 was promulgated  to provide the basis for the incorporation and functioning of credit bureaus in  Pakistan. Under the CBA, licensed credit bureaus are offering  comprehensive CIR to financial institutions on individuals/borrowers to  make informed decisions, borrowers’ creditworthiness and debt carrying  capacity.

1,"Stocks close week in green despite high inflation, trade deficit",An alleged case of Omicron in Karachi further deteriorated investors’ sentiments.,"KARACHI: The trading on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) began on a negative note in the outgoing week amidst a lack of positive triggers.
According to Arif Habib Ltd, negative sentiments were on account of a widening trade deficit and surging inflation. An alleged case of Omicron, the latest variant of Covid-19, in Karachi further deteriorated the investors’ sentiments.
However, the overall mood changed after the doctors found the variant to be non-lethal. Moreover, encouraging cement despatches, which went up seven per cent year-on-year, along with the expected resolution of the gas circular debt kept the momentum positive. But nervousness took over soon afterwards on the expectation of a hike in the benchmark interest rate.
As a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 43,396 points, gaining 163 points or 0.38pc on a week-on-week basis.
Sector-wise, positive contributions came from oil and gas exploration (320 points), technology and communication (257 points), food and personal care (32 points), chemical (29 points) and insurance (10 points).
Sectors that contributed negatively to the benchmark index were commercial banking (187 points) and cement (112 points).
Share-wise, positive contributors were TRG Pakistan Ltd (208 points), Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (155 points), Oil and Gas Development Company (101 points), Systems Ltd (49 points) and Mari Petroleum Ltd (34 points). Meanwhile, negative contributors were Engro Corporation (66 points), Habib Bank Ltd (64 points) and United Bank Ltd (44 points).
Foreign selling slowed down in the outgoing week and amounted to $1m versus a net sell of $62.84m in the preceding week. Major selling was witnessed in cement ($1.2m), fertiliser ($0.5m) and exploration and production ($0.3m).
On the local front, buying was reported by “other organisations” ($3.9m) followed by companies ($2.1m) and individuals ($1.3m). The daily average volume clocked in at 204m shares, down 36pc from a week ago, while the average value traded settled at $42m, down 54pc on a weekly basis.
AKD Securities said the future direction of the stock market will partly depend on a number of data points, including the monetary policy announcement due on Tuesday. The brokerage expects an increase of 125-150 basis points in the benchmark interest rate.
Another important data point, it says, will be the trade deficit figure. A decline in imports for December will provide the market with a sigh of relief. “Overall, we continue to advocate for thematic plays, which include banks (on monetary tightening), construction-driven sectors (cements and steel) and textiles (on devaluations and strong export prospects),” it said.

2,"CCP launches studies on SMEs, online platforms",Regulator makes recommendations to create level playing field.,"ISLAMABAD: As e-commerce and online businesses continue to grow at a fast clip across the country, the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) has launched draft studies on e-commerce platforms and the small and medium enterprises (SMEs), making recommendations to create a level playing field and address competition concerns. 
The study on “Competition and Trade Practices Regulation in the Era of E-Commerce, Big Tech and Data Sciences” highlights possible competition concerns in online platforms. 
The serious concerns and violations at the digital market forum fall under Section 3 (abusive conduct by dominant platforms) and Section 10 (deceptive marketing practices) of the Competition Act, 2010. 
The study contains analyses and the regulation strategies in developed countries across the globe as well as other countries in the region. 

Regulator makes recommendations to create level playing field

The e-commerce study aims to provide guidelines serving as a minimum benchmark of basic disclosures companies should follow to avoid deceptive marketing practices. 
The study is part of the CCP’s strategic vision that identifies priority areas for removing anti-competitive distortions in the market and at e-commerce platforms. 
The other draft study by the CCP — titled “Improving Economic Efficiency in Small and Medium Enterprises in Pakistan” — aims to provide guidelines for SME sector’s growth. 
The study reviews the SME policy framework in Pakistan and, based on two surveys concerning demand-side constraints and supply-side issues in SMEs’ growth and challenges in financing, offers recommendations to the government of Pakistan and other entities concerned to ensure a level playing field for these enterprises. 
The issues include improving the economic efficiency of SMEs and state-owned enterprises, collaborations and partnerships for providing guidelines, and improving compliance by strengthening the leniency framework, and knowledge-based advocacy. 
In a statement, CCP Chairperson Rahat Kaunain Hassan said the role of competition regulator was that of an umpire, and whenever it is called for policy intervention, it would voice concerns as per its mandate. 
She said the commission strongly believed in effective enforcement, which was globally viewed as the best advocacy, not only for the private businesses but also in public procurement to reduce concession agreements for regulatory exclusivity.

3,Modaraba Al-Mali aims to revive dormant firm,Says Drekkar Kingsway Ltd has agreed to make it happen by April 30.,"KARACHI: There was an unusual stock notice by an unusual company about an unusual business move last Friday. 
Modaraba Al-Mali, a small entity with market capitalisation of just Rs148 million, told investors that it’s made an “arrangement” with Drekkar Kingsway Ltd (DKL) that will allow the Islamic finance company to revive the listed but completely dormant entity and restore its “going concern assumption”. 
Modaraba Al-Mali, managed by Asset­plex Moda­raba Management Ltd, also gave a specific date — April 30, 2022 — for the complete revival of DKL under its novel business plan. “[The] financial impact (i.e. impact on net profitability) of this transaction on [Modaraba Al-Mali] will be around Rs100m,” it added. 
It sounds like a typical investment banking deal but leaves one wondering about many missing pieces of the puzzle. 
For example, how will a modestly sized Modaraba — which ranks 17th in terms of total assets among the 31 listed Modarabas with the sector-wide weight of less than 0.1pc in the KSE-100 index — revive within six months a paper company that’s barely dodged a winding-up petition and is still on the stock exchange’s defaulters’ counter? 

Says DKL has agreed to make it happen by April 30

“As a specialised corporate restructuring and Islamic venture vehicle, we believe in mobilising res­ources and providing shareholders with value cre­a­tion opportunities,” Aftab Ah­mad Chaudhry, CEO of Modaraba Al-Mali, told Dawn. 
His company approached the sponsors of DKL and convinced them to vote for its business revival plan and grant management control and board seats. “Shares become worthless in a listed shell company. Only a revival will give its shareholders the opportunity to unlock their investment and exit,” said Mr Chaudhry, who previously served as managing director of both Islamabad and Lahore stock exchanges. 
After getting the sponsors and other shareholders on board, Mr Chaudhry brought in another investor and submitted the business plan to the Islamabad High Court, which recently dismissed the winding-up petition against DKL. 
“Next up, we’ll extend a directors’ loan. My Moda­raba and the incoming sponsor will initially contribute Rs100m each,” he said. 
Mr Chaudhry hasn’t injected any equity into DKL yet. Corporate rules say that equity can’t be injected into a company arbitrarily unless all shareholders are offered an equal opportunity to increase their stakes in the same proportion. Since the company has no assets and can’t borrow from banks, the directors’ loan was the only option for Mr Chaurdhry’s Modaraba to provide the company with liquidity. 
So how will DKL revive after the injection of Rs200m in the form of debt? 
In walks the new sponsor Farhan Abbas Sheikh, CEO of Oilboy Ltd, an importer and distributor of unregulated energy products, particularly coal, with assets of more than Rs3 billion. 
DKL was originally listed in the 1990s as an engineering firm to manufacture electrical appliances. 
Meanwhile, DKL will change its name to Oilboy Energy Ltd, increase its authorised capital to Rs1.6bn and change the object clause of its memorandum of association. 
Afterwards, the rechristened entity will announce a rights issue, which means existing shareholders will get the right, but not the obligation, to buy new shares at a discount to the prevailing price. In case the rights issue remains unsubscribed, the directors will have the authority to inject funds either themselves or through their associates. The board may also vote for converting the Rs200m directors’ loan into equity. 
But why is Mr Chaudhry taking such a roundabout route to revive a dormant company? For instance, why don’t he and Mr Sheikh take over DKL by buying a majority stake? Or more simply, why doesn’t Mr Chaudhry help Mr Sheikh get his already up-and-running private company listed on the stock exchange? 
To the first question, Mr Chaudhry says his company wants to steer clear of the takeover laws, which apply at 30pc shareholding. 
As for the second question, he says even a shell company that’s listed but exists only on paper is currently valued around Rs20m. “The value is of the listing status. Taking a company public costs 6-8pc of the funds to be raised. This means a company may have to spend Rs30m-40m on various counts if it wants to raise Rs500m,” he said.

4,Karachi’s industrialists reject gas supply suspension,Suggest staggering gas holiday once a week.,"KARACH: Businessmen Group chairman Zubair Motiwalla has announced plan to stage protests, including a sit-in outside the head office of the Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd (SSGCL), against the suspension of supply to non-export general industries. 
Addressing a meeting at the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) here on Saturday, he said gas was not available to the CNG sector, general industries and even the domestic consumers, wondering where the 940 mmcfd gas had gone. 
Mr Motiwala said that details of utilisation of 940mmcfd gas available in the SSGCL’s system must be made public so that the business and industrial community could review the overall demand-supply situation. 
He suggested that the SSGCL should carry out a staggering gas holiday once a week along with better load management to keep entire Karachi operational without any problem. The gas supply suspension to all types of industries was hampering the overall production activities, he added. 

Suggest staggering gas holiday once a week

He said the SSGCL’s strategy to shut down general industries and keep the export-oriented industries operational might trigger hatred and confrontation amongst export and non-export industries. 
Mr Motiwala said it was unfair to suspend gas supply to the general industries which were higher in number as compared to export-oriented industries. General industries supplied essential raw materials to export-oriented industries and both being an integral part of the supply chain must stay operational, otherwise the economy and exports would suffer badly, he warned. 
He feared that gas suspension to general industries would not only result in increased unemployment but also fuel massive inflation due to shortage of essential goods in the market. 
According to a press release issued by the KCCI, Sindh Minister for Energy Imtiaz Shaikh has fully endorsed the standpoint of industrialists and said that the Sindh government was fully cognizant of the issue and would fully support the business and industrial community’s legitimate demand of uninterrupted supply to Karachi. 
“Suspension of gas to industries in Karachi would have serious repercussions due to city’s enormous and most vibrant role in the country’s economy, therefore, the federal government has to take up this matter on top priority and come up with a feasible solution to this grave problem,” the minister said. 
Chairman of the Pakistan Tanners Association (Southern Zone) Amanullah Aftab said in a statement that the area of ChamraMandi (Sector 7-A, Korangi Industrial Area, Karachi), which is contributing significantly to the leather exports with approximate 40 per cent share of total exports of leather sector of Pakistan, was deprived of gas these days. 
He said severe scarcity of gas would lead to cancellation of export orders, resulting in loss of foreign exchange. 
Mr Aftab recalled that the government had assured export-oriented sectors for regular gas supply for the execution of export orders.

5,SNGPL seeks determination of RLNG cost on actual supplies to Punjab,"The cost of supply of RLNG is being charged on the basis of the capacity of the pipeline, official says.","LAHORE: Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd (SNGPL) has asked the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) to determine the cost of supply per metric million British thermal unit (mmBtu) of RLNG on actual throughput instead of the theoretical designed capacity (1,200mmcfd) of the pipeline dedicated for supply gas to Punjab. 
“Actually the cost of supply of RLNG is being charged on the basis of the capacity of the pipeline which is 1,200 million standard cubic feet per day (mmcfd). But off and on, we receive less supply (1,000 or 1,050mmcfd) due to use of our gas (150 to 200mmcfd) by Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd (SSGCl) for supplying to K-Electric or any other means to meet its demand,” SNGPL managing director Ali J. Hamdani told Dawn on Saturday. “So our plea to calculated the cost of RLNG supply on the basis of actual supply and not the 1,200mmcfd designed capacity of the line,” he added. 
“Ogra has understood our point well,” he added.
In its petition, the company while discussing the issue has also requested the authority to allow the impact of diversion cost of RLNG while determining the RNLG sale prices in accordance with the ECC policy guidelines issued on Oct 7, 2020.
The company states that the determination of RLNG cost of supply at the theoretical capacity of 1,200mmcfd is not supported by any relevant law or rules. And therefore, it needs to be calculated at actual throughput.
According to the petition, the company says that license condition no. 5.2 requires the authority to not disallow any cost component without fixing the benchmark. 
Moreover, the reliance by the authority on Third Party Access (TPA) rules in case of sales of RLNG owned by the company. Furthermore, significant volumes are being withheld by SSGCL and sold to K-Electric by the same are not being accounted for by Ogra while determining the cost of supply.
“The RLNG diverted towards domestic sector also needs to be accounted for while calculating the cost of supply as the same has to be travelled through the RLNG infrastructure,” reads the SNGPL’s petition that further revealed that the SSGCL, on the direction of Ogra, is deducting the SNGPL’s RLNG volumes on account of Gas Internally Consumed (GIC) in their network while the same is not being taken into account in the end consumer price. 
It further mentioned that the impact of GIC, while calculating the cost of supply, is being calculated on the basis of theoretical throughput of 1,200mmcfd as against the actual throughput that is a fundamental error and needs to be rectified. “Finance cost paid on running finance for the payment to LNG suppliers is also justified to be included in the cost of supply,” the company seeks.
It urges Ogra to allow the cost of volume of RLNG deducted by SSGC and markup on running finance borrowed by the company to keep the supply chain of RLNG intact.
“The ECC of the cabinet in its meeting held on May 17, 2018 has already dismantled the WACOG. Therefore, determining the UFG disallowance at the national WAGOG is unjustified and lacks legal cover. Moreover the Ministry of Energy in its letter of July 9, 2021 has also advised Ogra to consider the abeyance of WACOG while considering the revenue requirement of gas companies,” the company states in its petition. 
On the other hand, the company has also asked the authority to review its decision of determining the UFG (Unaccounted for Gas) disallowance at the National Weighted Average Cost of Gas (WACOG) and calculate the same the company’s own cost of gas under the respective clause/condition in the license. 
It also mentioned that the authority had determined the UFG disallowance at the National WACOG of Rs558.01 per MCF instead of the SNGPL’s own cost of gas of Rs481.94 / MCF, resulting in an additional disallowance of Rs426 million.
In its petition, the company projects a shortfall in revenue requirement at Rs92.617 billion including Rs163 million on account of the LPG air-mix project for the year, and sought an increase in its average prescribed price by Rs269.03 per mmBtu with effect from July 1, 2021. The petitioner has also included Rs219.892 million shortfall pertaining to previous years, thus seeking a total increase in the average prescribed price by Rs907.75 per mmBtu from July 1, 2021.
