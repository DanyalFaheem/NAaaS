2,Province-wide boycott of OPDs continues,"Senior doctors suggest way out to end protest by nurses, young doctors...","KARACHI: Expressing serious concern over the prolonged boycott of patient services by house officers and postgraduate trainees and nurses at public-sector hospitals across Sindh, senior doctors on Friday urged the government to take immediate notice of the situation that had taken a heavy toll on patients.  
The junior doctors are boycotting OPDs (out-patient-department) at hospitals whereas nurses have also stopped giving service in general wards.  
“These protests have been continuing for the past several days, causing enormous difficulties to poor patients. The situation is extremely sad and unfair and must end,” said Dr Shahid Rasul, the executive director of the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), adding that junior doctors didn’t even let senior doctors perform duties at OPDs as they locked doors of the departments.  
Nurses’ protests, he pointed, had equally affected patient care services at JPMC. “It has been weeks that they have withdrawn services and there is no sign that this matter would be resolved any time soon. I personally think that there should be a grievance committee (in public sector hospitals) that should meet twice a month to look into the issues of healthcare professionals.” 

Senior doctors suggest way out to end protest by nurses, young doctors

Endorsing Dr Rasul’s views, Dr Mirza Ali Azhar of the Pakistan Medical Association-Sindh held the government equally responsible for the sorry situation. “Ultimately, they [government officials] have to hold a dialogue. There is no other way out. So, why can’t we sort out this matter immediately without making the poor suffer?” he asked.  
Dr Azhar regretted that the protests were being organised at a time when a cold wave had gripped the city and flu patients were reporting in a large numbers at healthcare facilities. 
Deadlock persists
Meanwhile, the deadlock between representatives of Young Doctors Association (YDA)-Sindh and Young Nurses Association-Sindh continued on Saturday and their leaders announced that protests would continue till their demands were met.  
In Karachi, OPD services were closed down in three key tertiary-care public-sector hospitals; Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, National Institute of Child Health and Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital.  
The doctors are demanding implementation of a paid deputation and central induction policies, increase in risk allowance and stipends of postgraduate trainees and house officers and regularisation of all doctors hired on contract basis.  
The young doctors also urged the government to make Covid-19 risk allowance a permanent feature of doctors’ salaries and resolve the matter of their transfers at JPMC and NICH.  
The government should also announce 500 seats of dental surgeons and make a separate cadre for the hiring of medical legal officers, YDA officials said.  
The nurses’ demands include regularisation of their colleagues appointed at various healthcare facilities over the past two years for services related to Covid-19 and implementation of the Pakistan Nursing Council decision, according to which, nurses should head educational and training institutions for lady health workers and midwives.  
The government, they demand, should also separate nurses’ education and deputation policies from that of doctors and raise stipend of trainee nurses who are getting a meagre monthly stipend of Rs15,880 unlike other provinces where this amount has risen to Rs33,000.

Addressing the rally attended by a large number of people, including women and children, he said that chief ministers in all provinces had seized all the monetary resources and powers in a sheer violation of the Constitution negating true spirit of the 18th Amendment to the Constitution.  
“They don’t devolve money and resources to the district level and then tell the deprived youth that the state is oppressing them,” he said.  
“Until the powers and resources are taken away from the chief ministers and passed onto the people at street level, the integrity of Pakistan will be in jeopardy. We will struggle against this dictatorial attitude because we are loyal to the state and not to any government.” 
The former Karachi mayor said that he made it clear that if the local government amendment bill was not repealed, it would force the party to take to the streets and amid such oppression, the PSP would use every legal and democratic forum to raise its voice.

4,Muttahida MPC rejects unilateral amendments to local govt bill,Speakers demand withdrawal of new bill.,"• Speakers demand withdrawal of new bill
• Calls for administrative, financial powers for LGs
• JI stays away from MQM-P event
KARACHI: Participants of a multiparty conference, organised by the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan on Saturday, unanimously rejected “one-sided” amendments to the local government bill saying the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party was creating an atmosphere of hopelessness, sense of deprivation and alienation among the people.
Almost all big and smaller political parties participated in the MPC. The Jamaat-i-Islami was invited but it chose to stay away from the event. The PPP, Pak Sarzameen Party and Mohajir Qaumi Movement-Haqiqi were not invited to the conference.
A resolution was presented by senior MQM-P leader Amir Khan and it was unanimously passed calling upon the PPP government to immediately withdraw the amended bill.
It denounced and rejected the LG bill on the ground that it goes against Article 140-A of the Constitution. It said that the 2013 LG system is still hurting Sindh. It called for political, monetary and administrative power for the local government organisations.
Mr Khan demanded in the resolution that a committee be set up to send in its suggestions to have a proper LG system that caters to all needs of the people. 
It called for all resources of Sindh to be distributed in Sindh first. And finally, it said that the people should believe that until this happens, all the parties present at the MPC will carry on fighting for the proper system as per the Constitution.
At the outset, senior MQM-P leader Senator Faisal Subzwari said: “The purpose of this conference is to hold a consultation of all political stakeholders to review Sindh government’s newly amended ‘anti-people’ Local Government Bill of 2021, and subsequently announce a combined strategy.
Former finance minister Dr Miftah Ismail of the Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N) said that he congratulated the PPP government in Sindh for being able to get power for the provincial government from the federal government. “But then this should continue as the provincial government needs to pass on the power to the local government in order to be able to reach out to the people,” he said.
“That’s the right way to extend services to the people. It would be better to set aside our political motives and designate work to the local governments as revenue generation goes to the divisions. That’s how you can fix the system,” he said.
Federal Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Asad Umar of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) joined in via Zoom to point out that the topic of discussion had not been taken up too seriously so far. “If there wasn’t any pressure from the courts here, we might not even hold local government elections,” he said.
“Sindh’s system is disabling. The Supreme Court should look into this, which it will hopefully. The Senate, too, should notice this. If you live in Sindh and want what’s best for it, then you need to understand that the local governments need administrative powers to serve the people here so give them their constitutional rights. The people, too, need to be made aware of their rights and motivated and mobilised to ask for it. The sooner this is understood the better,” he said.
Shahi Syed of the Awami National Party (ANP) said it is good to sit together and look for solutions to problems that ail Karachi. 
Aslam Ghori of the Jamiat Ulma-i-Islam-Fazl said: “There is a disconnect. The Sindh Assembly should make laws for the betterment of the people, not for ruling over them or stepping over them.”
Jillan Shah of Tehreek Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) said: “The premise of this bill is that the present government does not want a census. So it is a game being played against us.”
Tariq Hasan of the Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q) said: “There are property issues, water and sanitation issues. I believe the mayor should be heading the water board here. If you want the issues of Karachi to be resolved then you need to bring the institutions here under the mayor.”
Dr Saleem Haider of the Mohajir Ittehad Tehreek (MIT) said: “We had thought that if the provincial government failed us then we can look to the federal government. But here both have failed us. Both have brought us to situation where we can be pitied. Here Karachi’s children are running from pillar to post for domiciles to get admissions into colleges.”
Basharat Mirza of the Pakistan Democratic Party (PDP) said that Karachi was never given it’s due by any government. 
Fahimudddin Sheikh of the Pakistan Sunni Tehreek (PST) said that the LG bill was squashing the rights of all the citizens of Karachi.
Irfanullah Marwat, Allama Sadiq Jafri of Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen, Irfan Memon of All Pakistan Muslim League, retired Justice Wajiuddin Ahmed of Aam Aadmi Party also spoke among many others.
MQM-P convener Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui thanked all the participants. He said all stakeholders in the MPC unanimously expressed their lack of confidence on the PPP government.

6,Urdu short story and cultural landscape,‘Excessive use of symbolism made the kahani disappear from the afsana’...,"KARACHI: The first pre-lunch session of the penultimate day of the 14th International Urdu Conference organised by the Arts Council of Pakistan, Karachi began with a panel discussion on the Urdu short story (afsana). Moderated by Iqbal Khursheed, it was presided over by Aamer Hussein and Zaheda Hina.   
Khalid Javed, who spoke online from Delhi, said it is difficult to define modernism (jadeediat). The fact that modern literature is hard to comprehend is an indicator in itself that it’s modern. Modernists give preference to language and technique over meaning. They don’t subscribe to the regular definitions of the plot. It was in the 1960s that modern trends appeared in the Urdu short story with writers such as Anwer Sajjad, Khalida Husain and Surendar Prakash. Even the change that happened in the 1980s didn’t entirely move away from its effect. The modern story relies on language which is like a two-edged sword: it touches upon our interior world and at the same time creates new worlds around us.
Akhlaq Ahmed said the search for the story in the shorter format is still on. In the last 75 years, a lot of experiments were made during the search, most of which had already taken place in other parts of the world. And all this while, the short story kept telling stories of human beings in our society. “I’ve been listening for the last 40 years that quality short stories are not being written. Our short story is no less important than the short stories written by our predecessors.”   

‘Excessive use of symbolism made the kahani disappear from the afsana’

Amjad Tufail said Pakistani society came into being in 1947. One big change that took place at the time was a massive migration of people. It resulted in alterations in the cultural and societal set-up of the country because it changed its demographic graph. Communities such as the Anglo-Indians and Parsis began to diminish. Before partition, there were people of 43 different religious persuasions in Lahore alone. The short story writers at the time not only sensed and wrote about what was going on in society (Ashfaq Ahmed’s story Gadariya is an example) but also predicted what was about to come (Ghulam Abbas’s Dhanak).   
M Hameed Shahid spoke on the various technical experiments undertaken in the genre of the short story and lauded them.   
Khalid Fateh Mohammad said the short story has been an important pillar of Urdu literature. During independence, the genre made its presence felt under the influence of the Progressive Writers Movement. After independence, it drifted away from that movement. Sadat Hasan Manto chose partition as his subject. Subsequently, with some political changes that occurred in society such as the imposition of martial law, writers used symbolism to express themselves. However, excessive use of symbolism made the kahani disappear from the afsana.   
Summing up the session, Aamer Hussein said it was 30 years back that he started reading short stories in Urdu. He added while discussing our literature, we shouldn’t always give references to literature produced in the West because our short stories have all the right ingredients — lyricism and content.
Zaheda Hina said the history of the Urdu short story should be traced from 1903 and perhaps even before that. We have produced great names in literature.   
Society and Culture 
An important post-lunch session was arranged on Pakistan’s cultural and social landscape, moderated by Harris Khalique. 
Speaking on the occasion, former federal information minister Javed Jabbar said the heterogeneity of Pakistani society is a sign of its vibrancy. Pakistani culture is a vibrant one. It doesn’t mean that it doesn’t have illness — be it because of religious extremism or economic disparity, or because of civil-military differences. But the problems that we face don’t represent the vast majority of the people. “When our nation takes a political decision, why is it that it does so with such awareness (shaoor)? Not in a single general election we have elected a politico-religious party.” 
Architect Arif Hasan said the biggest change that has come about in the country is: that in 1941 the population of Pakistan [the areas that formed Pakistan] was 28 million, 14 per cent of which resided in cities. In 2017, the urban population increased to 36pc, though researchers suggest that it’s more than 50pc. Sindh’s 62pc urban population lives in Karachi, whereas Punjab’s 22pc lives in Lahore. Sindh’s 23pc population speaks Urdu while the mother tongue of only four per cent people in Punjab is Urdu. In Karachi, 72pc houses are of or less than 120 square-yards and only 1.5pc are of or more than 240 sq-yds — those who live on footpaths or sleep under bridges are not mentioned here.  And this difference is increasing at a rapid pace.  
Dr Noman Naqvi said the nation-state is a problem. We need to talk about reparation on a global scale. 
SZABIST president Shahnaz Wazir Ali said society will change if women are given equal rights and equal economic opportunities. Also, the quality of education must be raised.  
Dr Tariq Rahman said there is no dearth of resources in the country or talent. We need to exploit it.

7,"Opposition to move masses, court against controversial LG bill",‘Sindh govt wants to transfer all local level powers to Sindh Secretariat’...,"KARACHI: Opposition parties in the Sindh Assembly on Saturday decided to make a joint strategy against the recently passed Sindh Local Government [amendment] Bill 2021 under which masses would be mobilised against the ‘dictatorial law’ on one hand and the apex court would be moved, on the other, in order to challenge the Pakistan Peoples Party’s scheme that ‘violated’ all rules of the Sindh Assembly and bulldozed the bill through the assembly.  
The leaders of the opposition parties criticised the PPP provincial government for getting the bill passed from the assembly in ‘violation’ of rules and regulations for approval of a revised bill and vowed to protest against the unconstitutional step of the ruling party.  
Addressing a joint press conference in the Sindh Assembly building, Leader of the Opposition in Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh, parliamentary leader of Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) Kunwar Naveed Jameel, Arif Mustafa Jatoi of the Grand Democratic Alliance and other opposition legislators called the proceedings of the Saturday’s session against the defined rules of the Constitution.  

‘Sindh govt wants to transfer all local level powers to Sindh Secretariat’

“The PPP has once again proved that they want to impose authoritarian and dictatorial system in Sindh by denying rights and authority to elected representatives at the grassroots level,” said Mr Sheikh.  
“The Sindh Local Government Act 2013 is already in contravention of the constitution of Pakistan particularly its Article 140-A that provides for devolution of administrative, financial and political authority to local government while the Sindh government of PPP further usurped limited powers and functions of the third tier of government through the controversial amendments.” 
Kunwar Naveed Jamil of MQM-P said that the opposition was left with no option but to take to streets as the Speaker was not allowing them to speak in Sindh Assembly.  
The opposition legislators were humiliated and not allowed to discuss issues of public importance on the floor, he added.  
“We are already in contact with the masses. No one should remain in any misunderstanding that the people would accept this anti-Sindh law from the PPP. We would mobilise masses and also approach the court to exercise our legal rights,” he warned.  
The GDA lawmaker Arif Mustafa Jatoi stated that the PPP wanted centralisation of all powers and was trying to consolidate all authority of local government institutions in the Sindh secretariat.  
All the rights and responsibilities of local representatives were being transferred to minister and secretaries through the LG bill, he said.  
“The PPP has a history of hypocrisy and double game. They claim and present themselves to people out of Sindh and foreign world as ‘true democrats’. But in Sindh, they are worst then feudal and dictators,” he claimed.

11,"Institutions not cooperating in anti-encroachment drive, SHC told",Finance secretary summoned to respond to DC’s complaint...,"HYDERABAD: The Hyd­e­rabad circuit bench of the Sindh High Court has ordered special secretary of Sindh local government department, Sindh Building Con­trol Authority and Hyd­erabad Development Auth­ority to provide copies of relevant record to civil administration to help it ensure anti-encroachment drive after the officers concerned complained lack of cooperation by other institutions. 
The bench comprising Justices Mohammad Iqbal Kalhoro and Adnanul Karim Memon also directed regional director of the SBCA and head of HDA to cooperate with deputy commissioner and share with him copies of record whenever the officer required them for taking action against encroachments.  
It also directed focal person of Sindh secretary of finance to appear in the court and respond to Hyderabad Municipal Corporation’s (HMC) complaints that funds were not released for carrying out anti encroachment drive. 

Finance secretary summoned to respond to DC’s complaint

The bench passed these directions while hearing two identical petitions about encroachments and adjourned the case to Dec 23, according to the court order issued on Saturday. 
Hyderabad deputy commissioner Fuad Ghaffar Soomro informed the court that results of the anti encroachment drive as desired by Sindh High Court had not been achieved due to certain hiccups and problems.  
He explained that removal of soft encroachment was responsibility of local government department, municipal committees and corporations. A distinction should be drawn between ‘soft’ and ‘hard’ encroachments, he said. 
The court confronted officers of HMC and Qasimabad municipal committee with the DC’s assertion and they undertook to carry out the operation on a daily basis to remove soft encroachments from designated areas.  
They were directed by the court to coordinate with the DC and identify areas where any government or public property had been encroached upon by any individual and remove it in compliance with this court and Supreme Court’s orders. 
HMC’s municipal commissioner said that encroachments had been removed from Khokhar Mohallah and the drive was still going on. He undertook that encroachments, if any, would be removed within the shortest possible time. 
The bench directed the DC to carry out operation against encroachments in Hyderabad and submit report to the court after cleaning the areas. The drive be launched in surrounding areas afterwards, said the court.  
The court noted lack of coordination between dep­art­ments concerned was leading to failures and directed heads of the departments concerned to liaise with the DC to make the drive successful. The police officer directed SHOs to keep an eye on ‘soft’ encroachment in their. 
Additional DC Lal Dino Mangi informed the court that whenever municipale bodies were approached for obtaining master plan and other required documents to identify the encroached areas they flatly refused to hand them the record. This was the reason, he said, the drive was not proceeding ahead and producing results.

13,"Five gangsters involved in killing of 12 Chachar tribesmen eliminated, says DIG",Police call it breakthrough in months-long operation to root out ‘dacoit culture’ from Larkana...,"LARKANA/SUKKUR: Five gangsters, four of them carrying different amounts of head money, were killed in a fierce gun battle in the katcha area of Durrani Mahar taluka in Kandhkot-Kashmore district, Larkana DIG Mazhar Nawaz Shaikh said in a press statement on Saturday. 
The dreaded outlaws were wanted by police in the infamous ambush that had left 12 members of the Chachar tribe in the same area on May 16, he said, adding that scores of cases of heinous crimes had been registered against the gangsters at various police stations.     
The DIG citing the crime sheets of the killed dacoits said that a head money of Rs10m on Takkar Sabzoi, Rs3m on Jagan alias Jaggu Sabzoi and Rs1m each on Sabul alias Sabo Sabzoi and Saddam Sabzoi was announced by the Sindh government. He identified another dead dacoit as Ali Hassan Sabzoi alias Sodoro. The gun battle took place near the fortified hideout of a gang led by Jeand Jagirani within the jurisdiction of the Durrani Mahar police station, he said.

Police call it breakthrough in months-long operation to root out ‘dacoit culture’ from Larkana

The cases against these gangsters pertained to murder, kidnapping for ransom, encounter with police, extortion, dacoities and robberies etc. 
“The bodies and firearms, seized from the dead outlaws, are in police custody,” the DIG said on Saturday evening.
He specifically mentioned that police constables Ghulam Hyder Bhayo and Sajjad Khaskheli were martyred in the gangsters’ attacks on Oct 29, 2019 and June 14, 2021, respectively. 
The Larkana DIG said that the gangs had regularly been threatening contractors of the Ghotki-Kandhkot bridge and the area’s police command through their videos on the social media.
Police sources said that 58 cases of heinous crimes had been registered against Takkar, 32 cases against Jaggu, 10 cases against Sabo, seven cases against Saddam and six cases against Sodoro at different police stations of Kandhkot-Kashmore district. 
According to a spokesman for the district police, the area had remained cordoned off since the May 16 incident and movement of gangsters had constantly been monitored and checked. Many encounters with them had taken place and some of them were either killed or arrested during the period. The fresh gun battle took place after Kandhkot SSP Amjad Ali Shaikh received information about presence of the ringleaders at a specific place and ordered a forceful operation against the Jagirani and Subzoi gangs.
Meanwhile, speaking to the media, DIG Shaikh said the breakthrough in the ongoing police operations against dacoits’ gangs in several districts of upper Sindh was continuation of strategy to wipe out gangs from the katcha area.
“We are rooting out the dacoit culture from the Larkana police range and putting permanent police signature in the area. First we wiped out Teghanis’ gangs in Shikarpur, then Usman Wako’s gang in Qambar and now Sabzois’ gang in Kandhkot,” he pointed out.
The DIG claimed that cases of kidnapping for ransom and highway robberies had been brought to nil. Law and order in the region stood restored, he said.
