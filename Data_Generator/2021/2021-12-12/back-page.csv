“For its part, Pakistan remains ready to pursue measures that would reinforce peace, stability and prosperity in the region if the enabling environment is created by India,” the premier said while talking to the delegation of US senators on Saturday. 
While referring to the continuation of egregious human rights violations in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), Mr Khan said: “The extremist and exclusionist policies of the RSS-inspired BJP are posing a threat to regional peace and security.”  

PM apprises visiting senators of threats posed by BJP’s exclusionist, extremist policies

He asked Senators Angus King, Richard Burr, John Cornyn and Benjamin Sasse, who called on him at PM House, that the US must play its role in the maintenance of peace and stability in the region, according to the Prime Minister Office (PMO).  
All the four visiting senators are members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, while Senator King is also a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
Warmly welcoming the senators, PM Khan said a deeper and stronger partnership between the Pakistan and the United States was mutually beneficial and critical for region’s peace, security and prosperity.  
He said Pakistan was committed to expanding its longstanding relationship with the US in all spheres particularly in the economic dimension. He expressed the hope that the visits of congressional delegations would help strengthen mutual understanding and forge closer people-to-people contacts.  
With regard to the evolving situation in Afghanistan, the PM emphasised that Pakistan and the US must have deeper engagement to promote the shared objectives of peace, stability and economic development. He particularly highlighted need for urgent support to the people of Afghanistan to prevent a humanitarian crisis and economic collapse. He also called for closer cooperation to address security threats in the region, including terrorism.  
Recalling collective struggles of Pakistan and the US over the decades in promoting peace and security globally, the senators deeply appreciated Pakistan’s recent contribution to evacuation of the American nationals and others from Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover in August.  
According to the PMO, the senators reaffirmed their commitment to stable and broad-based Pakistan-US bilateral relationship. Given the size of Pakistan’s population and its geostrategic location, the US and Pakistan should make determined efforts to promote trade, investment and economic cooperation, they said. 
Senators call on COAS 
Later, the delegation, headed by Senator King, called on Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa and discussed matters of mutual interest with him. 
The army chief said Pakistan desired to maintain productive bilateral engagement with all the regional players and wished for peaceful, diversified and sustained relations. He expressed urgency for global convergence on Afghanistan to avoid looming humanitarian crisis and need for coordinated efforts for economic uplift of the Afghan people. 
Gen Bajwa also thanked the visiting senators, who were accompanied by US Charge d’ Affaires to Pakistan Angela Aggeler, for their efforts in forging mutual understanding of geopolitical and security situation in view of challenges ahead. 
During the meeting, current security situation in Afghanistan and bilateral cooperation in various fields were discussed. The visiting dignitaries appreciated Pakistan’s role in Afghan situation, special efforts for border management and role in regional stability and pledged to play their part for furthering diplomatic cooperation with Pakistan at all levels.

1,Three West Indies cricketers in Pakistan hit by virus,"Left-arm fast bowler Sheldon Cottrell and all-rounders Roston Chase, Kyle Mayers are self-isolating for 10 days.","KARACHI: Three West Indies cricketers have tested positive for coronavirus and will miss the limited-overs series in Pakistan starting next week.
Cricket West Indies (CWI) said on Saturday left-arm fast bowler Sheldon Cottrell and all-rounders Roston Chase and Kyle Mayers tested positive in Karachi and are self-isolating for 10 days.
All three were in the Twenty20 squad while Chase was also chosen for the three one-day internationals in Karachi that follow the three T20s.
A non-coaching member of the West Indies staff also tested positive. CWI said all four members of the touring party were fully vaccinated and without major symptoms.
CWI chief executive Johnny Grave said the rest of the group have continually tested negative and the tour will go on. “The risk of Covid-19 infection is impossible to remove completely from a cricket tour, in spite of the fact that many of our players have been living in bio-secure bubbles almost continuously since before the (Caribbean Premier League),” Grave said in a statement.
“This unusual loss of three players from our squad will seriously impact our team preparations, but the rest of the squad are in good spirits and will begin training today ahead of our first game on Monday,” he said.
The series of three T20s begins on Monday.
The limited-overs squad already received a blow when regular captain Kieron Pollard was ruled out due to a hamstring injury he sustained last month during the T20 World Cup in the United Arab Emirates.

Two suspects have been arrested for kidnapping and raping the girls, making their objectionable videos, posting the same on internet and blackmailing them.  
The girls were sent to Afghanistan by their family.     
“A formal request has been sent to the Afghan government for sending back both the girls to Quetta as the girls are presently in Kabul,” Mr Langove said.   
He said the government would fulfil its responsibility by taking legal action against the suspects. “The suspects do not deserve pardon and all possible steps would be taken to provide justice to the affected families,” he said.    

Video scandal suspects remanded into police custody

Chief Minister Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo was personally monitoring the investigation as it was a matter of the honour of women and no one could tolerate such shameful activities, he said.   
The adviser has called a meeting on Sunday (today) to review progress on the investigation.   
Meanwhile, a judicial magistrate of Quetta on Saturday remanded the two men believed to be involved in kidnapping and raping the two sisters, filming them, posting the videos on internet and blackmailing them in police custody for seven days.   
Amid tight security, the police produced the main suspect and his brother before the judicial magistrate and sought their seven-day remand for interrogation. 
The court accepted the request.   
Police have launched an investigation in view of complaints submitted by two women. In one application, the complainant said that the suspects had kidnapped her two daughters and were blackmailing them after making their objectionable videos and posting the videos on social media.   
A senior police officer, who is part of the investigation team, said that mobile phones, laptops and other equipment used for filming the videos had been sent to Punjab forensic laboratory for forensic tests. He said police were conducting raids for the arrest of a third suspect who was still at large.   
Police officials said that a similar case had been registered against the suspect at Sariab police station last year.   
Meanwhile, members of civil society took out a procession to protest against the video scandal. Led by human rights activists Huma Foladi, Seema Batool and Hameeda Nooral, the participants marched on Jinnah Road and Adalat Road. Finally, they converged outside Quetta Press Club where they chanted slogans.   
Ms Foladi and other speakers condemned the shameful act against the girls and said that the culprits must be awarded exemplary punishment.   
They said that the prime suspects was earlier booked in a similar case but no legal action was taken against him due to support of influential people.
