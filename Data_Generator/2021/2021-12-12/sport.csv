0,England’s best option is to make brave calls: Root,Says his one regret is not giving left-arm spinner Jack Leach more protection against some aggressive batting.,"BRISBANE: Joe Root didn’t back away from the contentious calls to bat first in the Ashes series opener when conditions appeared to heavily favour the bowlers, or on a team selection that omitted England’s two most experienced pacemen.
One regret he had after England’s nine-wicket loss to Australia at the Gabba on Saturday was not giving left-arm spinner Jack Leach more protection against some aggressive batting.
Leach was punished by the batsmen, conceding 102 runs for one wicket and going for almost eight runs per over on a pitch that didn’t really take much conventional turn but did offer plenty of bounce to suit Australian off-spinner Nathan Lyon.
Travis Head (152) and David Warner (94) were particularly attacking against Leach, who was playing his first Test since March and his first ever in Australian conditions.
Root said setting a more defensive field would have helped Leach gain some confidence and ease into the series.
“I put a lot of that on myself ... made it very difficult for him [Leach] and it’s probably more on my shoulders than looking at the selection,” Root said.
Leach’s place in the starting XI was only confirmed at the coin toss, with England hoping to get a more varied attack by leaving out fast bowler Stuart Broad.
It didn’t help that England weren’t defending many runs, having lost a wicket on the first ball of the series and been dismissed for 147 just before heavy rain ended play on the first day.
“If we go about things the way we did on the last two tours we’ll get the same result,” Root said, reflecting on England’s last two tours to Australia which included nine losses, one draw and no wins. “We have to be brave. I look back and think [batting] was the right decision.
“In terms of selection, we could have gone a different way [but] we wanted variety in our attack and ways of changing things.”
Ollie Robinson, Mark Wood and Chris Woakes created opportunities for England, but some missed catches and poor fielding let them down. All-rounder Ben Stokes was restricted in his first Test since March, had issued with his run-up and the popping crease, and appe­ared to be bothered by injury.
A veteran of four Ashes tours to Australia, Broad was a surprising omission, a decision confirmed a day after the news that 39-year-old Jimmy Anderson, who has been to Australia on five Ashes tours, would be rested for the series opener.
The pair have a combined 1,156 wickets from 315 Tests, but are coming off injuries. They will both come into calculations for the second Test a day-night match starting on Thursday at the Adelaide Oval. Their ability to swing the ball could be pivotal for England in those conditions.
“You can’t question the guys that were out there — our seamers created so many chances — we just weren’t good enough to take them,” Root said. “But it’s nice to know [Broad and Anderson] should be fit and available and ready to go, for Adelaide.”

1,Hobart to host fifth Ashes Test after Perth axed,BRISBANE: Hobart will host its first-ever Ashes Test after winning the race on Saturday to replace Perth for the...,"BRISBANE: Hobart will host its first-ever Ashes Test after winning the race on Saturday to replace Perth for the fifth and final clash of the current series between Australia and England.
The Tasmanian capital beat out heavyweight competitors Sydney and Melbourne with the Test to be a day-night pink-ball affair at the 20,000-capacity Blundstone Arena from Jan 14-18.
Perth was stripped of its hosting rights earlier this week over Western Australia state’s tough Covid quarantine rules, which required players to quarantine for 14 days. There are no such regulations in Tasmania.
“The submissions we received were outstanding and we had no doubt that each of the venues that took part would have hosted a wonderful event,” said Cricket Australia chief Nick Hockley.
“There were a range of considerations, including commercial, logistical and operational factors and on the balance of these, the CA board agreed on Blundstone Arena being the most appropriate venue to host the fifth Ashes Test.”
While the Sydney Cricket Ground and Melbourne Cricket Ground are bigger venues, Hobart won powerful support from Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Sports Minister Richard Colbeck.
It makes up for Hobart losing what would have been Australia’s first-ever Test against Afghanistan in November, which was postponed after the Taliban regime effectively banned women from playing the sport.
The first Test ended in Brisbane on Saturday. The series now moves to Adelaide, also a day-night Test, before the traditional Boxing Day Test in Melbourne followed by Sydney and Hobart.

2,Verstappen beats Hamilton to pole in Abu Dhabi decider,"The pole is Verstappen’s 10th of the 22-race season, more than anyone else.","ABU DHABI: Red Bull’s Max Verstappen landed a big blow in his winner-takes-all title battle with Lewis Hamilton by seizing pole position for Formula One’s season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Saturday.
Mercedes’ seven-time world champion Hamilton will line up alongside on the front row, with Verstappen on the quicker soft tyres for the start and the Briton going for the more durable mediums.
The pair are level on points in the standings, with Verstappen ahead 9-8 on race wins — meaning he will be champion regardless of where he finishes if Hamilton fails to score for any reason.
“I didn’t expect that, but amazing job guys,” said the Dutch 24-year-old over the team radio after being told he had secured pole under the Yas Marina floodlights for the second successive season.
“That was a fantastic lap from him,” said Hamilton.  “We’re in a good position with our tyres for tomorrow.”
The pole was Verstappen’s 10th of the 22-race season, more than anyone else, and he was helped with a vital slipstream ‘tow’ down the straights behind his ever-helpful Mexican team mate Sergio Perez, who qualified fourth.
“It was a great team work,” said Perez.  “Very pleased for Max that I managed to support him there.”
Hamilton’s team-mate Valtteri Bottas qualified only sixth in his last race for Mercedes.
Hamilton had been fastest in practice and the first phase of qualifying but Verstappen was top in the second phase after he ‘flat-spotted’ his set of medium tyres and switched to the soft Pirellis.
“The lockup wasn’t ideal so it kind of forced our hand,” said Horner.
Hamilton had lapped nearly half a second faster than Verstappen to top the first session ahead of Bottas, with both doing a run more than the Red Bull driver, but ended up with a best effort of 1:22.480.
George Russell, 17th, was outqualified by Williams team mate Nicholas Latifi in the Briton’s final session before replacing Bottas next season.
Alfa Romeo’s Kimi Raikkonen, the 2007 world champion with Ferrari, will start his 349th and final race before retirement in 18th place.

3,Sterling penalty earns leaders City win over 10-man Wolves,Manchester City dominated the second half of the game.,"MANCHESTER: England forward Raheem Sterling’s 100th Premier League goal was enough to earn leaders Manchester City a 1-0 win over 10-man Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday.
Wolves were doing a fine job of frustrating City in the opening period before striker Raul Jimenez’s dismissal for two yellow cards in quick succession in first-half stoppage time changed the complexion of the game.
City dominated the second half as a result, edging in front through Sterling’s penalty — a decision that required a lengthy VAR check — in the 66th minute.
The home side had plenty of chances to make the result more comfortable, with Jack Grealish’s struggles since becoming the British record transfer in the close season continuing as he missed from close range.
However, one goal proved enough for City who picked up their sixth successive league win to move four points clear of Liverpool, who were hosting Aston Villa later on Saturday, at the top of the standings.
Wolves, who battled hard as decisions went against them at the Etihad Stadium, stay eighth on 21 from 16 games.
The game hinged on one moment of madness. Wolves looked comfortable going into the interval before Jimenez’s needless dismissal gave City the lift they needed.
The Mexico international received his first yellow card for a foul on midfielder Rodri and 31 seconds later got another for blocking Rodris free-kick having not retreated enough.
After the break, it was all-out attack from City, with Conor Coady clearing off the line to deny Ilkay Gundogan.
Referee Jon Moss then further ensured he won’t be welcome in Wolverhampton anytime soon after awarding City a penalty for handball against Joao Moutinho.
The Portugal midfielder was adamant the ball hit his ribs but, following a long delay while the video assistant referee checked the incident, Mosss decision stood.
Sterling slotted the penalty down the middle, becoming the 32nd player to reach 100 Premier League goals.
“[It] is a lovely achievement,” Sterling told BT Sport.  “There are some fantastic players in that list. I’m really honoured to be in it now.
“We knew we [City] had to keep patient. They kept it really tight, but we knew if we kept playing wed get an opportunity -and we did.”
The hosts should have made the win more comfortable. Bernardo Silva was denied by a smart save from Wolves goalkeeper Jose Sa, while several other last-ditch blocks kept them at bay.
The visitors piled forward late on and had one last-gasp opportunity to snatch a point, but Ederson tipped Max Kilman’s header over the bar.
On Friday, Brentford scored a stoppage-time  penalty through Bryan Mbuemo following Pontus Jansson’s header to secure  a comeback 2-1 home win over Watford as  they cancelled out a first-half opener from Emmanuel Dennis.
The  result lifted Brentford to ninth on 20 points from 16 games, while  Watford stayed 17th on 13, three points above the relegation zone.
Watford  seemed to be home and dry in the closing stages after making light work  of keeping the hosts at bay in the second half, before collapsing in  the last 10 minutes as they conceded a pair of soft goals.
Brentford made the brighter start as visiting  goalkeeper Daniel Bachmann tipped over a Shandon Baptiste shot in the  fourth minute and then kept out a Mbuemo effort before Watford sprung to  life midway through the first half.
Joshua King hit the post for  the visitors in the 24th minute and Dennis fired them ahead less than 60  seconds later, powering in a thumping header from a Tom Cleverley  corner.
Brentford pressed after the break and Bachmann produced  another fine save in the 74th minute to palm away a stinging shot by  Christian Noergaard before King had an effort smothered at the other end  by home keeper Alvaro Fernandez.
But the home side drew level in  the 84th minute as Jansson glanced in a close-range header before Mbeumo  turned the match with a penalty at the death after William Troost-Ekong  fouled substitute Saman Ghoddos.

Franck Haise’s team played their usual eye-pleasing football and were quickly in front with goals from David Pereira Da Costa and Arnaud Kalimuendo, only for Randal Kolo Muani’s second-half double to cancel the advantage and Simon to finish them off.
The result left Lens, who have now picked up three points in their last five games after notably also conceding a stoppage-time goal in a 1-1 draw against Paris St Germain last weekend, in fifth place on 27 points from 18 games.
PSG lead the standings with 42 points from 17 matches while Nantes are now 10th on 25 points.
Lens got off to a brilliant start, with Pereira Da Costa firing home from close range after Massadio Haidara’s cross was parried by Nantes keeper Alban Lafont into his path.
Eight minutes later, Kalimuendo doubled the advantage, sliding the ball into the empty net after dribbling past Lafont.
It was Lens’s 100th shot on target this season and they became the first team to reach that tally.
Their goalkeeper Jean-Louis Leca suffered an ankle injury after being fouled by Randal Kolo Muani and had to be replaced at halftime by Wuilker Farinez.
The Venezuela international conceded their first goal after four minutes when Kolo Muani’s back deflected Ludovic Blas’s fierce strike into the net.
In the 58th minute, Farinez was beaten again when Kolo Muani latched onto Willem Geubbels’s cross to equalise.
Lens pushed forward in a bid to bag all three points but ended up with nothing as Simon beat Farinez with a splendid shot from just outside the area into the top corner in the 90th.

Shoaib, 20, of the PAF upset 41-year-old Aqeel in a thrilling see-saw decider which lasted over two hours.
Shoaib got off to a flying start, taking a 3-0 lead in the opening set but Aqeel fought back to draw level before Shoaib regained control and took the set 6-4.
In the second set, after a few closely fought games, Aqeel, who is a grasscourt expert, took complete control to win 6-3.
The deciding set saw some exhilarating tennis before Shoaib ultimately prevailed winning the set 6-3 despite best efforts from Aqeel who over the years has remained Pakistan’s top national player besides representing the country in many international competitions. 
Shoaib has been training at the National Training Centre since its inception in 2019, and is a scholarship holder.
Earlier on Saturday, Sarah Mehboob overpowered Ushna Sohail in a thrilling three-set women’s final lasting three hours.
Though a close final was expected, Sarah had chalked out her own plan which worked well for her throughout the match keeping her opponent at bay.
Ushna played some calculated tennis to lead 5-2 in the first set but Sarah fought back to win the set 7-5.
In the second set, Ushna again went ahead 3-0 and then made it 5-3 but again Sarah rose and managed to make it 5-5. However, Ushna in the end regained her composure to grab the set 7-5. The third set went down to the wire with Sarah holding her nerve to take the set 6-4 and the title.

Andr Hahn grabbed the other goal as the visitors ended Colognes status as the only team unbeaten at home in the league. Augsburg hadn’t won any of their 13 previous away games.
Cologne had more of the ball in the first half, but the visitors created the better chances thanks to their speed on the break. Augsburg’s Michael Gregoritsch had an early goal ruled out for offside.
The home team started with more intent after the break, when Anthony Modeste drew a good save from Rafal Gikiewicz, but further chances were squandered due to imprecise play.
Hahn scored against the run of play in the 72nd minute when goalkeeper Marvin Schwabe could only palm Ruben Vargas cross to the Augsburg forwards feet. Hahn reacted faster than any Cologne defender could, to prod the ball in.
Dorsch sealed the win in the 88th with a brilliant strike from outside the penalty area to inside the top left corner.
It lifted Augsburg out of the relegation zone to 14th in the 18-team division ahead of the rest of the 15th round. Cologne remained ninth after their first defeat in five games.

Asad...","KARACHI: A week of tennis ended with three titles for Asad Zaman, making his journey from Lahore worthwhile.
Asad swept to the boys’ under-16, under-14 and doubles at the 10th Essa Lab National Seniors and Juniors Tennis Champ­ionships, which concluded here at the Modern Club on Friday.
It was a show of utter dominance by Pakistan’s top-ranked player in the under-14 age category.
Yet, when he participates on the international level, he’s no match for his opponents.
“At an International Tennis Federation tournament, I was completely outplayed by my opponent,” Asad told Dawn at the end of the championships. “We don’t get to play top international tournaments in Pakistan often and there is a lack of competition here.”
Asad has dreams. He wants to play at Grand Slam tournaments like Wimbledon. But getting there, isn’t easy.
It requires top-level competition week in week out; something that can’t be offered in Pakistan.
Asad, however, is one of the few Pakistani junior players who has a sponsor; most of his costs are covered by fast food behemoth McDonald’s. 
That isn’t the case with Mohammad Ahtisham, who claimed the boys’ under-18 title with a three-set victory over Raahim Veqar.
“We do get support from the tennis federation but it’s not enough,” he told Dawn. “The more high-level tournaments we play, the more our performances will get better. But to go and play at those tournaments, we need sponsors which we don’t have.”
Tournament organiser Khalid Rehmani, who is the secretary of the Sindh Tennis Association, though, blames the players for not doing enough.
“We’re doing our job of promoting the game,” Rehmani, the former Pakistan Tennis Federation secretary, told Dawn.
He claimed the junior players “were given a daily allowance” while “their travelling expenses are also covered”.
“Ninety percent of the blame for why Pakistan’s tennis players don’t reach the top lies with the players themselves,” added Rehmani.
“The players don’t train hard enough. You have to train at least seven to eight hours but players don’t devote this much time.
“The federation or government only covers expenses twice or thrice but after that the players have to do that on their own. That’s how it’s done in the whole world.”
Rehmani vowed that the STA will continue to organise tournaments so that the players get an opportunity to play.
The championships saw over 150 players taking part and other noteworthy achievers were Natalia Zaman, who won the girls’ under-18 title, Samer Zaman, who clinched the under-12 crown, and Rashid All Bachani, the winner of the under-10 event.

11,Milestone for Lyon as ruthless Aussies flatten England in Brisbane,BRISBANE: A ruthless Australia crushed England by nine wickets to win the first Ashes Test in style just after lunch...,"BRISBANE: A ruthless Australia crushed England by nine wickets to win the first Ashes Test in style just after lunch on day four here at the Gabba on Saturday.
Needing just 20 runs after bowling England out for 297 in their second innings -- with Nathan Lyon taking his 400th Test scalp -- Australia cruised to the target in 5.1 overs when Marcus Harris square-drove Mark Wood for a boundary.
The only blemish was the wicket of makeshift opener Alex Carey, who was out for nine, caught behind off the bowling of Ollie Robinson.
Regular opener David Warner was unable to bat due to a rib injury he suffered when he was twice hit by Wood in the first innings.
Australia will carry a 1-0 lead in the five-match series into the second Test, which starts in Adelaide on Thursday.
“A lot of things did go right,” said Pat Cummins, making his debut as Australia Test skipper. “So someone was smiling on me. I’m really proud of everyone, I thought it was a really complete performance.”
England will need to regroup after being dismantled with both bat and ball at the Gabba.
After being bowled out for 147 in the first innings, England then struggled to make any impression with the ball, with player of the match Travis Head (152), Warner (94) and Marnus Labuschagne (74) all punishing the English attack, particularly left-arm spinner Jack Leach.
The visitors did fight back on the third day with a defiant partnership between captain Joe Root and Dawid Malan, but once they both fell early on Saturday, English resistance crumbled.After starting the morning in a reasonable position at 220-2, the English lost eight for 77 in the extended first session.
England’s batting issues at the Gabba were mirrored in the broadcast compound, where a power failure resulted in the worldwide television feed going down for 45 minutes.
No wickets fell during this period but when the broadcast problems were finally resolved, Lyon struck.
The 34-year-old off-spinner had looked ineffectual on Friday as he searched for his milestone 400th wicket.
But he finally broke through when Malan got an inside edge onto his pad and the ball popped up to Labuschagne at silly mid-off, sparking huge celebrations around the Gabba. Malan made 82.
Lyon, in his 101st Test, became just the 16th player worldwide to achieve the feat of 400 Test wickets, and only the third Australian after Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath.
Immediately after the match, Lyon said reaching the milestone of 400 Test wickets and joining cricket’s greats had not yet sunk in.
“It hasn’t really hit me yet to be honest,” he said. “No doubt I’ll get my phone and call my family and friends, and that will probably hit a little bit closer to home, I guess.
“But it’s something that I’m very proud of, there’s no doubt about that. It’s been some hard toil to get it, but it’s very rewarding, that’s for sure.”
England were rocked in the next over when Root, on 89, wafted at a ball outside off stump from Cameron Green and got a thin edge to wicketkeeper Carey, leaving England 229-4 and Root still searching for his first Test century in Australia.
Lyon then struck again, getting a ball to bite and leap off the Gabba pitch and take the thick edge of Ollie Pope’s bat, Steve Smith taking a comfortable catch at slip.
Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler tried to steady the ship as Australia took the new ball, but Cummins brought himself on and had immediate success.
Bowling with real pace and aggression, Cummins squared Stokes up with a brute of a ball that took the outside edge and flew to Green in the gully, leaving England 266-6.
Two runs later, Josh Hazlewood, who was under an injury cloud after not bowling after tea on Friday, drew a faint edge from Buttler to leave England staggering.
Robinson joined Chris Woakes at the crease and the pair put on 18 runs to ensure Australia had to bat again.
But Robinson attempted a reverse sweep off Lyon and spooned a simple catch to Head at backward square leg.
Lyon took his fourth wicket just before the scheduled lunch break when he bowled Wood, who had attempted an extravagant drive.
With nine wickets down, the umpires called for an extra 30 minutes to be played before lunch and Green wasted no time, snaring Woakes.
It only took 20 minutes after the lunch break for Australia to take the win.
Meanwhile, England were fined their entire match fees and docked five World  Test Championship points for maintaining a slow rate of overs during  the Brisbane Test, cricket’s  world governing body said.
Root’s side were ruled  to be five overs short of the target after time allowances were taken  into consideration, with match referee David Boon imposing the sanction.
Early on Saturday, a power failure at the Gabba halted global broadcast coverage  of the match.
“There has been a power  issue affecting the broadcast compound at the Gabba, resulting in the  world feed going down and all resulting technology not working,” a  Cricket Australia spokesman said. “The issue is being worked on  with the aim to get everything working as soon as possible.”
Coverage  resumed after an interruption of about half an hour.
A CA  spokesman also confirmed all DRS technology was unavailable, leaving the  game to the on-field umpires during the outage, when the stadium’s big  screens were also down.

13,Two cup races highlight 15th Winter Meeting at LRC today,LAHORE:  A six-event card studded with two cup races has been dished out for the15th Lahore Winter Meeting which ...,"LAHORE:  A six-event card studded with two cup races has been dished out for the15th Lahore Winter Meeting which gets under way here at the Racecourse on Sunday.
In all,  52 runners are taking part in races  carded for turf action in the afternoon. Two races will be held over 900 metres, two over 1000 metres and as many over 1400 metres.
The featuring event, the Naseeb Cup, a class VII Division I handicap race, has only seven runners. However, in spite of the tiny field the beauty of it lies in the fact that nearly half a dozen of them are on chance which would make picking the winner a difficult task.
Chestnut colt, Barbarians Charge, bay cloys Amazing Runner and Professor and a well-bred filly Silver Fast looks the pick of the runners to decide about the top honours.
The supporting event, the Khyber Cup, a class VII Division VI event, contains nine runners. It looks an open affair as the field has a mix of in-form and out-of-form horses, who have produced some good performance in the near past.
Meanwhile, race-goers have disliked the raising head of male chauvinism in racing with the denial of opportunity to Alishba Mohsin, the only female rider, and called upon the management to curb the tendency.
Talking to Dawn, racegoers  said  by sowing the seeds of  chauvinism and fanning prejudice the racing mafia was  tarnishing the image of genteel sports, which they insisted should be condemned.
