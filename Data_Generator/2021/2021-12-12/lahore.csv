7,Transpersons seek change in symbol of identity,Secretary’s letter to Nadra chief points out issue,"MUZAFFARGARH: Not many people in the country know that alphabet ‘X’ is used to represent the transpersons by Nadra in registration documents as opposed to ‘M’ for males and ‘F’ for females.  
The community is not happy with this identity assigned to them by the registration authority. In a letter addressed to the Nadra chairman, a copy of which is available with this correspondent, Secretary School Education South Punjab, Dr Ehtasham Anwar, has requested the authority to consider any other appropriate symbol or alphabet to represent the third gender.  
The School Education Department, South Punjab was the first department in the country to have opened doors of public education for the transpersons under its project TRANSEDUCATION a few months ago. Based on its interaction with the community, the letter says that it “was found averse to this identity due to negative connotation attached to the alphabet.”  

Secretary’s letter to Nadra chief points out issue

The department had even conducted research in the dictionary meanings of ‘X’ and top five English language dictionaries, namely Oxford, Cambridge, Merriam-Webster, Macmillan, and Collins were consulted. It was revealed that amongst other meanings, the alphabet was used to indicate the nature of films which were considered unsuitable for persons under a certain age.  
Similarly, another meaning denoted a person or entity which happened to be unknown or unnamed, which was in fact an actual dilemma being faced by every transgender individually, and the alphabet ‘X’ seemed to reinforce the same perception impliedly, if not explicitly, says the letter.  
Finally, it had been suggested that the transgenders might be assigned alphabet ‘T’ on the pattern of ‘M’ for males and ‘F’ for females, or any other appropriate alphabet or symbol.  
Dr Ehtasham Anwar told Dawn that seemingly a small issue, it was a question of identity and dignity for the transgenders. He also said that given the excellent track record of Nadra, he was confident that the authority would be able to find an acceptable solution to the problem. He was of the view that such an announcement could be made on Dec 10 – International Human Rights Day – as it was the most opportune time to address one of the long-standing concerns of a community which was struggling hard to get its due rights in the prevalent social system of the country.

Deputy Commissioner Irfan Ali Kathiya told Dawn that the plan included the mega projects of the construction of two flyovers and the widening of 11-kilometre long Circular Road connecting city’s two railway stations of Bahawalpur and Baghdadul Jadid.  
The existing Circular Road dual carriageway, he said, was planned to be widened on the side of the Quaid-i-Azam Medical College (QAMC). It is learnt that on the left side of Circular Road the cost of existing commercial centres, plazas, markets and buildings was very high and it could be very difficult for the government to acquire their spaces and pay compensation.  
A sum of Rs470 million was expected to be released this year and the whole project was expected to complete within two years. 
He said the project would be launched after a go-ahead by the Provincial Development Working Party and would include a flyover from Fowara Chowk (Khatm-e-Nubuwatt Chowk) to Bindra Pulli on Multan Road estimated to cost Rs1.2 billion. The other flyover measuring about three to four kilometres at Dubai Chowk on Ahmedpur East highway may cost a Rs450 million, he said. 
Besides, about 1.75km long Noor Mahal Road would be carpeted at a cost of Rs1,100 million and 4.2km long Dubai Palace Road to be widened at a cost of Rs270 million.  
The deputy commissioner, along with Bahawalpur Cantonment Board Executive Officer Ramiz Shafqat (in whose jurisdiction Dubai Palace Road falls), inspected the site and ordered city Assistant Commissioner Naeem Cheema to launch an operation to demolish the encroachments and illegal buildings. He said the earlier proposal of constructing an underpass at Dubai Chowk has been dropped.

11,"Shehbaz, Hamza case: FIA gets show-cause notice for delay in submitting inquiry report","Agency ‘defies’ banking court, attempts to submit report to another court in vain.","LAHORE: A special court (offences in bank) on Saturday issued a show-cause notice to Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Punjab Director Zone-I Dr Rizwan Ahmad for not submitting challan (investigation report) in the money laundering and sugar scam inquiries into the charges against Leader of Opposition in National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif and his son Hamza Shehbaz.  
In the previous hearing, the court had given a last opportunity to the FIA with a warning to its prosecution team in case of further delay in submission of the investigation report.  
However, a prosecutor told the court on Saturday that the report was complete but it would be submitted before the judge special court (Central-I). The FIA had previously raised an objection to the jurisdiction of the special court for banking offences to take up the matter.  

Agency ‘defies’ banking court, attempts to submit report to another court in vain  

Duty judge of the special court (offences in bank) Aslam Gondal took exception to the prosecutor’s statement and observed that the act of the FIA was a violation of the court’s previous order. He observed that the court was exercising restraint and not issuing a contempt notice to the prosecution team.  
The judge adjourned the hearing for a short break as the prosecutor said the investigation report under Section 173 CrPC will be submitted if the file was kept in wait for a while. However, no one appeared on behalf of the FIA when the judge resumed the hearing again.  
A written order issued by the duty judge said, “The file has been taken up again but after some wait neither anyone has appeared on behalf of the prosecution nor a report under section 173 of CrPC has been submitted or any reason for non-submission of challan has been furnished”.  
The judge issued a show cause notice to the director FIA-Punjab Zone-I Lahore to explain as to why despite a direction, submission of challan on first call had not been submitted and why the prosecutors had not appeared before the court later.  
The duty judge adjourned hearing till Dec 16 and also extended the pre-arrest bail of Shehbaz and Hamza till the next hearing.  
Meanwhile, Judge Special Court (Central-I) Ijaz Hassan Awan also rejected the request of the FIA to let it submit the investigation report before his court.  
It is learnt that after seeking time from the duty judge of banking offences court, FIA Director Dr Rizwan Ahmad, along with prosecutors Chand Ashraf, Munazza Shaheen and Aqeelur Rehman Khan and investigating officer Syed Ali Mardan, appeared before the special court (Central-I) and requested it to receive the report.  
Judge Awan observed that the petitions of the suspects for pre-arrest bail were pending before the special court for offences in bank. He noted that the duty judge of the other court had directed the prosecutor to submit the report subject to decision on the objection regarding the jurisdiction decided by the same court.  
The judge remarked that his court could not receive the investigation report that should be filed before the same court that was hearing the bail petitions in the FIRs.  
The FIA had booked Shehbaz and his sons, Hamza and Suleman, in November 2020 under sections 419, 420, 468, 471, 34 and 109 – financial fraud, impersonation and forgery – of the PPC and 5(2) and 5(3) – criminal misconduct – of Prevention of Corruption Act and r/w 3/4 of Anti Money Laundering Act.

He said all efforts would be made to “shake the conscience” of parliamentarians representing the government and its allies to save the country and its people from the “devastating effects” of this mini-budget. 
“The incumbent government has become a threat to national security. Trying to fix the crisis-hit economy with a mini-budget will be like treating cancer with aspirin. The government must resign, instead of further destroying the economy with such a disastrous mini-budget prepared by the IMF,” he said.

“The people have still not been given appropriate relief in petrol prices in accordance with the international price cut, which is unfortunate,” he said and added that the hike in the prices of electricity, gas, petrol, and essential commodities had made life of the people even more miserable.

16,PM briefed on Indian dam plan and ‘inevitability’ of Ravi project,Report presented to premier says the project is the only way to mitigate the looming threat to depleting groundwater.,"LAHORE: A report presented by the Punjab government to Prime Minister Imran khan during a briefing in Islamabad a couple of days ago warns of an Indian dam project, claiming the Ravi Riverfront Urban Development Project is the only way to mitigate the looming droughts and the potential threat to the already depleting groundwater of Lahore and the surrounding areas. 
In the the briefing, the Ravi Urban Development Authority (Ruda) Chief Executive Officer Imran Ali informed the premier that the Ravi project would transform of the river into a perennial fresh water body having enough capacity to pass extreme floods and save the provincial metropolitan facing an “existentialist threat”. 
The officials while discussing the factors necessitating the Ravi project, said the construction of MR Link Canal served as a “bypass” for Lahore.  
It says that in the wake of Indian Basin Treaty, India increased its water diversion capacity on its (then) existing infrastructure, reducing the flows to Pakistan. The loss of groundwater in Lahore its surrounding was compensated through MR Link Canal to help replenish the aquifer and allowing the fishery to survive. This arrangement worked well till year 2000, but a significant drop in the Ravi River flow has been observed since completion of Thein Dam in India, in 2001. 
Since then, the flow in Ravi River near Lahore has been limited to less than 20 percent of what it was before 2000. Currently, every winter season, when MR Link Canal is closed, the river flow gets reduced to less than 300 cusecs, which is even less than the design capacity of Lahore canal’s 400 cusecs. 
“But, the biggest shock to the Ravi River and Lahore is yet to unveil. India is constructing another dam downstream Thein Dam, named ‘Shahpur Kandi Dam’. The dam’s purpose is to store and divert any and all waters for which Thein Dam falls short. Moreover, the ‘Shahpur Kandi Dam’ is set to become functional by Nov 2022. And we can only imagine the drought [like] state of the river after that,” reads the report.  
“While we [in Pakistan] are still busy evolving consensus on our water related projects and replying to courts, the trans-boundary side [India] is making actual progress. Adhering to the words of Indian prime minister, they are making actual progress to make Pakistan suffer for every drop of water,” the report mentions. 
It warns that given the situation, the river, which is a major contributor to groundwater recharge, is inching towards an “existential crisis” for Lahore. After the drastic gradual decrease in the river flows, the report says, there is a net shortage of almost 600 million cubic meters of groundwater recharge per year, ultimately resulting in 1.2 meters per year average decline in groundwater levels. If drastic measures are not taken, Lahore may face a Cape Town (South Africa)- like situation where people have to stand in long queues to get a few gallons of potable water. 
“Indian dams are not just causing droughts but also posing a constant potential threat of floods. The huge catchment area of Ravi River receives plenty of rainfall during monsoon. Any sudden release from the dam or failure of dam body itself can cause a flood of a huge magnitude. The result would be a catastrophic loss of properties and lives in and around Lahore,” it warns, recalling the 1988 floods when Shahdara breaching section had to be operated to save Lahore city from flood.  
The report mentions that presently there is no mechanism to pass a Ravi water flow having a magnitude like that of 1988 along Lahore. It adds that even if the bottlenecks are removed, a huge vulnerable population chunk comprising roughly 80,000 people, living in the floodplain, either needs protection or relocation. 
It mourns the loss of riverside recreations like boating and fishing, once available to the Lahorites, as they have been deprived of such activities because of the diminished flows. 
The report promises further addition of barrages on the river and formation of a lake to keep the water body rejuvenated even during the low flow season.  
It envisages a safe, “vibrant and eco-friendly river” which would be a source of water life for Lahore. It quotes examples of river channelisation and riverfront locations in other countries, including Germany, UK, Australia, China and even India.  
“The project will eliminate the threats to Lahore, reconnecting river and the city, and securing the water for the generations to come,” the report concludes.

Polling for the by-poll on the Punjab Assembly’s seat, which fell vacant after the death of disgruntled PML-N MPA Nishat Ahmed Khan Daha, is due on Dec 16. 
The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has set up 185 polling stations for around 230,698 voters of the constituency where 13 candidates were competing, declaring 23 polling stations ‘highly sensitive’ and 84 other ‘sensitive’.  
The ECP has requisitioned the services of the Rangers for maintaining law and order during the polling in the constituency to depute the personnel outside the polling stations. 
The PML-N has fielded Rana Muhammad Saleem, who was a PTI candidate in the 2018 general election for the seat and the PTI has pitched Munaza Perveen, the widow of late Daha against him. Daha had defeated PTI’s Rana Saleem by a margin of 3,546 votes in 2018. 
The PPP has retained its 2018 candidate, Wasiq Sirjees Haider, while the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) has nominated Muhammad Akmal. 
Parliamentarians of all the four parties are joining the election campaigns of their respective candidates, notwithstanding the ECP’s code of conduct that bars public office-holders from taking part in electioneering. 
The election authority has issued show-cause notices to ex-prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani, PTI ministers Ahmed Yar Hiraj, Hamid Yar Hiraj and Hussain Jahania Gardezi, PML-N’s Awais Leghari, Ataullah Tarar and others for violation of the code of conduct. 
The constituency, mostly comprising Khanewal’s urban areas, is considered a stronghold of the opposition PML-N as out of 44 wards of the municipality, it had won in 29, while 15 were bagged by the PTI in the last local body polls. 
On the other hand, the PTI supporters hoped this time the party would clinch the seat as late Daha had executed a number of development works in the constituency during his lifetime, while his widow would also bag sympathy votes. The PTI is also selling the Health Card Scheme and Ehsas programme to woo the voters. 
As per a local observer, Ashraf Gadhi, the rising inflation is a big disadvantage for the PTI campaigners as wherever they go people ask about the ever-increasing prices of essentials.  
He believes that those who had voted for late Daha in the last election may change their opinion after his death, predicting a close contest in the by-poll. 
Rana Bilal, a lawyer, says the TLP could have been a challenge for the PML-N, but the Sialkot lynching incident has turned the public opinion against the party and many voters are seeing it as a “violent organisation”. However, despite this negative image, its nominee is likely to bag around 10,000 votes, he says. 
Sardar Mustansar, a supporter of the PML-N, says that in view of the low turnover in the Lahore NA-133 by-poll, the party has assigned wards to various local leaders for bringing voters to polling station on the polling day to use their right to franchise.
