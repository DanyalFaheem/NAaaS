0,Assessment committee fixes price of land to be acquired under Rawalpindi Ring Road project,"Owners to be paid between Rs100,000 and Rs800,000 per kanal if valuation approved, official says.","RAWALPINDI: The District Price Assessment Committee has fixed the value of land to be acquired for the Ring Road Project and sent it to the Punjab Board of Revenue for final approval.
After getting the green signal, the process for land acquisition will start, a senior official told Dawn.
Valuation of the land was started after the Punjab government approved the land acquisition PC-I for the Ring Road worth Rs6.7 billion.
According to the new plan, the Ring Road will be 38.3km-long and will start from Banth near Rawat and end in Thalian near the motorway.
The district administration imposed Section 4 in 36 mouzas (villages) of Rawalpindi and Gujar Khan tehsils for the acquisition of land.

Owners to be paid between Rs100,000 and Rs800,000 per kanal if valuation approved, says official

Eight of the villages are located in Gujar Khan - Kaliam Awan, Jhaliyari Bhai Khan, Chanba Papin, Banth, Mohra Mehr Bakhsh, Qutb Ferozwal, Bhagwal Dargai and Hardo Jagi.
There are 28 villages in the Rawalpindi tehsil, including Kaliam Mughal, Losar, Tamar Ratyal, Basali, Banian, Dhaki, Jhada, Hathial, Mera Mohra, Mandhal, Kai Mirbaz, Kheghar Kalan, Bhattian, Noordin, Hoshayial, Mohra Phuphra, Mohra Gar, Kamalpur, Chappar, Khasala Khurd, Meera Kalan, Kohala Maafi and Ghariba.
A senior official of the district administration said the committee fixed the price of land between Rs100,000 to Rs800,000 per kanal. However, the Punjab Board of Revenue is yet to approve the valuation.
He said the price of structure which would come on the route of the road would be announced later.
The project would be launched under the Annual Development Programme (ADP) and the provincial government would provide funds for it.
The official said the government was yet to get back the money paid to people whose land had been acquired along the old alignment of the Ring Road which was canceled on corruption charges.
When contacted, Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Ali confirmed to Dawn that the assessment committee had sent the land valuation for approval to the Punjab Board of Revenue. He said Section 4 had already been imposed to stop sale and purchase of land in the areas.
In reply to a question, the DC said 50pc of the money had been taken back from the owners whose land had been acquired last year from Rawat to Murat.
On the other hand, Commissioner Syed Gulzar Hussain Shah on Saturday visited the site of the Ring Road and inspected the areas where the proposed road would merge into the motorway adjacent to Thalian Interchange.
He asked Nespak to prepare a detailed plan to merge the Ring Road into the motorway at Thalian Interchange, adding that the consultant should also submit a plan and an assessment report on the next 10 years in case traffic from the Ring Road merged into Islamabad-Lahore Motorway.
He said the plan should be submitted within a week so it would be forwarded to the National Highway Authority (NHA) for vetting.
It may be mentioned that the NHA already has expressed reservations over the plan, saying merging traffic would create a rush on the motorway.

1,Former IHC judge returns to law practice,"“Before becoming a judge, I was a successful lawyer and I am glad that I am re-starting my practice,” he says.","ISLAMABAD: After pursuing his own case of removal as a senior judge of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) for over three years, Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui has finally decided to start law practice.
Mr Siddiqui will pursue cases of his clients in the Supreme Court, all high courts and Shariat Court.
“I am re-starting my practice as a lawyer from Monday,” Mr Siddiqui told Dawn on Saturday.
The ousted judge of the high court said he had taken many cases of his clients and started studying them.
“Before becoming a judge, I was a successful lawyer and I am glad that I am re-starting my practice,” he added.
President Arif Alvi removed Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui as a judge of the IHC on Oct 11, 2018 after the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) recommended his removal for being guilty of misconduct over a speech he delivered in July that year before the Rawalpindi District Bar Association.
The SJC is a constitutional forum that examines the conduct of superior court judges and then recommends their removal from the top post.
While addressing an audience at the Rawalpindi bar, Justice Siddiqui had reportedly claimed that personnel of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) were manipulating judicial proceedings.
On Nov 24 this year, the Supreme Court restored the licence of Justice Siddiqui as an advocate and therefore he decided to resume law practice after a long interval from tomorrow (Monday).
“I have over seven years of experience as a judge, 23 years as a lawyer and almost three-and-a-half years as a complainant in the Supreme Court,” he told Dawn.
Mr Siddiqui is also establishing his office in the federal capital. “I live in F-11, therefore I am establishing my office near my home,” he added.
Before becoming the IHC judge, Mr Siddiqui resided in Rawalpindi’s Gawalmandi area.

2,National Institute of Health analysing samples of 3 suspected Omicron cases,The results of the samples will be received by Monday.,"ISLAMABAD: The National Institute of Health (NIH) on Saturday said results of samples of three suspected cases of Omicron variant of Covid-19 will be received by Monday (tomorrow).
However, University of Health Sciences Vice ChancellorProf Dr Javed Akram said people should not get panicked because the delta variant, which was being reported in 95pc cases across the globe, was four to five times more virulent than Omicron.
An official of the NIH, requesting anonymity, said samples of three persons were received at the lab on Thursday night.
“Though we get result of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test the same day, genome sequencing which is done to confirm the exact variant of the virus, is a lengthy and complicated procedure. We will get the result by Monday. There can be a new mutation in the virus and we may find a new variant just like Omicron reported in South Africa,” he said.
On Dec 8, the Sindh government claimed that though genomic study had to be done for confirmation the way the virus was behaving in a female patient seemed it was the Omicron. The matter was widely circulated in the media and reported as the first case of Omicron.
However, on Dec 9, the NIH issued a clarification stating that the sample was yet to be confirmed as Omicron through whole-genome sequencing, adding it would be obtained from the Sindh government.
However, in the light of the global situation, NIH suggested to the citizens to get vaccinated at the earliest.
Dr Akram, while talking to Dawn, said the virus should be called Omicron even if had a bit different variation.
“In the PCR test, it has been confirmed that there is dropout of spike gene which is only observed in Omicron. However, a positive factor is that till date not a single death has been reported from Omicron, so people should not get panicked. Vaccines are effective against Omicron and even if people become infected there would be minor symptoms, especially among those vaccinated,” he said.
Replying to a question, Dr Akram said Omicron had 50 variations and was reported in Africa where vaccination rate was just six per cent.
“People should get themselves vaccinated to create herd immunity, reducing the chances of variation and eradicate the virus. Delta is still the most virulent variant of Covid-19 and is infecting 95pc people across the globe, including Pakistan,” he said.

3,Judicial powers of chief commissioner challenged,"Petition says under Constitution, the official not vested with powers of provincial govt...","ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) is examining a question raised by a petitioner challenging the judicial powers of the chief commissioner of Islamabad.
While both the judiciary and executive are separate pillars of the state, during the martial law regimes the powers to administer justice were given to executives. In the recent past, following the Army Public School (APS) tragedy, military courts were, through a constitutional amendment, empowered to try civilians. However, the legislation lapsed due to a sunset clause.
The IHC is examining the issue raised in a petition that pointed out that the Capital Development Authority (CDA) was still exercising judicial powers.
The petition cited an amendment to General Clauses Act 1897 made on July 1, 1979, through an ordinance by the then president of Pakistan. The new clause pertained to Islamabad.

Petition says under Constitution, the official not vested with powers of provincial govt

As a consequence, in the context of Islamabad, the federal government is understood to be performing the functions of the provincial government, as being a federating unit the capital has the special status as provided in Article 1 of the Constitution.
“Subsequent to the amendment to the General Clauses Act, the martial law administration primarily operated on the basis of presidential orders. To that end, on December 31, 1980, the president issued the ‘Islamabad Capital Territory (Administration) Order’ for the enablement of the delegation of administrative powers vesting in the federation to an administrator to be appointed by him.”
Through a presidential order in 1990, the term administrator was renamed as the chief commissioner who could exercise only those powers in the federal capital which could be delegated to him in writing under the law from time to time.
The petition said Article 175 of the Constitution provided that the judiciary shall be progressively separated from the executive initially within a period of three years which was subsequently extended from time to time.
The Supreme Court in the case of Sharaf Faridi finally settled this matter. Its judgment approved the separation of executive magistrates from judicial magistrates on the model of the Law Reforms Ordinance 1972. Thereafter, through the promulgation of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Ordinance (XXXVII of 2001) the executive magistracy was abolished. This was protected by the 17th amendment.
The petition said the chief commissioner on August 11, 2020, issued a notification regarding entrustment of powers of the executive magistrate to the senior special magistrate CDA and empowered him to assume jurisdiction in the matters related to the CDA ordinance, Municipal Administration Ordinance 1960, West Pakistan Pure Food Ordinance 1960, Sections 268, 269, 270 and 273 of Pakistan Penal Code 1960 relating to offences affecting the public health safety, convenience, decency and morals, Islamabad (Preservation of Landscape) Ordinance 1956, regulations issued by the CDA under Section 51 of the Capital Development Authority Ordinance 1960, Civil Defence Act, Forest Act 1927, Islamabad Wildlife Protection, Preservation, Conservation and Management Ordinance 1979.
According to the petition, the magistrate is “purportedly in exercise of powers wrongly conferred upon him under the impugned notification.”
It added that a magistrate exercises judicial powers in respect of particular cases or to a particular class or particular classes of cases, or in regard to cases generally in any local area.
Such conferment could only be made by the provincial government on the recommendations of the high court, it stated, adding the notification provides for conferment of powers upon the officer under section 6 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898 for which the approval of the high court was a prerequisite.
The petition said the chief commissioner was not vested with powers of the provincial government under the Constitution and respective laws on the subject, adding only the federal government could make such an appointment and that too as prescribed in the Supreme Court judgment passed in the Mustafa Impex case.
The apex court in this judgment defined the federal government and declared that even the prime minister cannot take a decision unless he was empowered by the federal cabinet.

Addressing a public gathering at Lub Meel near Taxila, the minister said that Rs30 million would be spent on upgradation of girls elementary school to higher secondary school, Rs165 million had been allocated for rehabilitation of 7.5km-long Union council Usman Khattar – Bodo road and Rs50 million would be spent on construction of 2.30-km-long Bodo-Bajjar road. 
He said all the development work would be completed during the current fiscal year. 
He said the government was focusing on real issues like tackling inflation and was least concerned about opposition parties’ anti-government moves, which could not succeed in the past.
He said Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) no time to discuss public interest issues but was organising public meetings. 
“The PDM has become a haven for the elements involved in corruption, but the nation has fully recognised the faces of those who have looted the country,” he said. 
While criticising former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, he said the leader of PML-N was enjoying a luxurious life in expensive apartments in London.
Though price hike was an international phenomenon, the PTI government was trying to bring down the prices particularly of food items, he added.

8,Archaeologists make new discoveries in Taxila,Archaeologists have discovered artifacts apparently belonging to the ancient Buddhist site Bhir Mound.,"TAXILA: Archaeologists have discovered antiquities apparently belonging to the ancient Buddhist site Bhir Mound, also known as the first city of Taxila valley civilisation which was abandoned between the first century BC and the second century AD by Bactarian Greeks who were the last inhabitants of the city.
The discoveries of potsherds and other terracotta were made accidently during the construction of an outer wall of the multipurpose auditorium which is under construction at the archeological museum Taxila complex.
However, the department of archaeology and museums failed to carry out a salvage operation before giving approval for the construction of the auditorium at the site where remains of ancient Gandhara civilisation are still buried. The auditorium is being constructed at a cost of Rs25 million and expected to complete during the current fiscal year.
Talking to Dawn, deputy director department of archaeology and museums Mohammad Iqbal Manj confirmed the discovery of potsherds and other terracotta items. He said broken pieces of pottery and bowls in intact condition were found accidently. 
He said soon after the discoveries of terra cotta the department suspended the construction work and secured the area. Subsequently, a four-member excavation team was formed by the director general of the department, Ilyas Gill, led by renowned archaeologist Mohammad Hassan Khokhar who served as the curator, archaeological museum Harappa for almost a decade. 
He said the team would further make excavations and carry out salvage operations to probe any further discovery.
Responding to a question, he said the discovery was “evidence of presence of antiquities” at the particular location in the museum compound.
The team leader of the archaeologists, Muhammad Hassan Khokhar, told Dawn that the discovery of terra cotta was evidence of human settlements in the ancient site. He said he was optimistic about some major, extraordinary and exclusive discoveries at the location after finding the two terra cotta bowls which are mostly used by monks for palms. He said initial investigation of these discoveries showed that they belonged to the later age of the first city of Taxila and dated back to the second century AD.
According to the archeologists, the Bhir Mound archaeological remains represent one stage of the historic city of Taxila. 
The first town in Taxila was situated in the Hathial mound in the southwest corner of the Sirkap site. It lasted from the late second millennium BC until the Achaemenid period, with the Achaemenid period remains located in its mound. 
The Bhir Mound site represents the second city of Taxila, beginning in the pre-Achaemenid period and lasting till the early Hellenistic period.
Bhir Mound, along with several others nearby excavations, forms part of the Ruins of Taxila inscribed as a Unesco World Heritage Site in 1980.

9,Call to conserve blue carbon in coastal areas,ISLAMABAD: Environmental experts at a workshop on Friday said conservation of blue carbon in coastal areas of...,"ISLAMABAD: Environmental experts at a workshop on Friday said conservation of blue carbon in coastal areas of Pakistan vital to combating impacts of global warming.
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco), in partnership with WWF-Pakistan, jointly organised a one-day consultative workshop on the importance of blue carbon in the coastal areas of Pakistan.
The objective of the session was to present, share and discuss the work that had been done towards developing blue carbon habitats and bring different stakeholders on board to identify gaps. 
The aim was also to finalise and agree on the way forward to work on recommended steps towards sustainable coastal ecosystem management.
The workshop was attended by all the relevant national stakeholders, international experts, and participants from the relevant ministries, government departments, NGOs, research institutes and academia.
Blue carbon is the carbon stored in coastal and marine ecosystems and is critical along the coasts, supporting coastal water quality and healthy fisheries, besides protecting the coastal areas against floods and storms.
According to the organisers, the key areas of focus for the blue carbon initiative were mangroves, salt marshes and sea grasses. Coastal ecosystems were essential for the environment and in alleviating global climate change, which helped provide protection from storms, were nursery grounds for fish, sequestered blue carbon from the atmosphere and oceans.
WWF-Pakistan Senior Director Conservation Biodiversity Rab Nawaz, said: “Blue carbon is part and parcel of a sustainable blue economy that is rapidly being recognised as an important part of managing and conserving coastal ecosystems. Pakistan is blessed with a rich coastline but the coastal communities are some of the most vulnerable groups in the country. Developing blue carbon credit systems can be a sustainable approach to generating income for communities by recognising their role in conserving these unique habitats.”
Pakistan Meteorological Department Director General Mohammad Riaz said mangroves in the coastal areas provided a shield to coastal communities in case of tsunamis. 
He also highlighted the role of early warning systems and automatic weather stations in monitoring of mangroves.
Dr Shahbaz Khan, Unesco Director of Beijing and representative to China, DPRK, Japan, Mongolia and the Republic of Korea, in his remarks stated: “There is a lot of potential if the economic model is linked with mangroves. We need to see how much carbon credits we can get for the economic benefit of local communities.”

In his resignation, Dr Mohammad Tariq said he accepted the responsibility of warden with the spirit to ensure merit.
“Chief provost and me used to give notices to all those violating hostel rules so that maximum deserving postgraduates (PGs)/medical officers (MOs) can be accommodated in the available rooms.
“I accepted this position voluntarily as a resident of the hostel as I was well aware of all the issues faced by doctors living in the hostel and highlighted all the genuine issues they faced on daily basis. I took up some practical work like hostel whitewash, getting approval for installation of security cameras, provision of new furniture, LED TV for common room, coolers and geyser,” the resignation letter states.
“As a warden I found political wing of PTI and its presidents other members who were enjoying single rooms while many deserving postgraduate trainees/MOs were without rooms.
“Instead of replying to the notices this political wing did personal attacks on me and tried to do character assassination by doing false propaganda for which I have started necessary legal proceedings,” he stated.
YDA Chairman Dr Haider Abbasi, while talking to Dawn, said it was unfortunate that a political wing of doctors has been established in the hospital.
“If it was not checked, we fear that all political parties will establish their political wings in the hospital. I believe that there should be no politics in the hospital. Ministry and hospital administration should look into it,” he said.
When contacted, Director Hospital Dr Ijaz Qadeer said that a committee headed by Neurologist Dr Mazhar Badshah has been established to look into the issue of hostel and ensure merit while allotting the rooms.
