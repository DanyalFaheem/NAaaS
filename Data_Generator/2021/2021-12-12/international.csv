The World Bank-admi­nis­tered Afghan Reco­ns­truction Trust Fund (ARTF) will this year give $180m to WFP to scale up food security and nutrition operations and $100m to Unicef to provide essential health services, the bank said in a statement. 
The money would aim to support food security and health programmes in Afghanistan as it sinks into a severe economic and humanitarian crisis that accelerated in August when the Taliban overran the country as the western-backed government collapsed and the last US troops withdrew. 
The United States and other donors cut off financial aid on which Afgh­anistan became depe­ndent during 20 years of war and more than $9 billion of the country’s hard currency assets were frozen. 
The United Nations is warning that nearly 23 million people, about 55 per cent of the population, are facing extreme levels of hunger, with nearly 9 million at risk of famine as winter takes hold in the impoverished, landlocked country. 
Using reconstruction trust fund money and channeling it through the WFP and Unicef, both part of the UN family, appears to be a way to get funding into the country for basic needs in a manner that does not necessarily implicate US sanctions against the Taliban. 
“This decision is the first step to repurpose funds in the ARTF portfolio to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Afghanistan at this critical time,” the bank said, saying the agencies had presence on the ground to deliver services directly to Afghans in line “with their own policies and procedures”.    
“These ARTF funds will enable Unicef to provide 12.5 million people with basic and essential health services and vaccinate 1 million people, while WFP will be able to provide 2.7 million people with food assistance and nearly 840,000 mothers and children with nutrition assistance,” it added. 
In its statement, the bank said it would “continue to work with ARTF donors to unlock additional ARTF funds to support the Afghan people”.   
Laurel Miller, a former acting US special represen­tative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, criticised the decision to tap the ARTF for strictly humanitarian aid.

1,"Call for Western unity against Russia, China threats","We need to come together to stand up to aggressors who are seeking to limit the bounds of freedom and democracy, British FM says.","LIVERPOOL: Russian sabre-rattling against Ukraine and an assertive China were top of the agenda as G7 foreign ministers met in Britain on Saturday, with calls for a united front against authoritarianism. 
The two-day gathering of top diplomats from the world’s richest nations in Liverpool, northwest England, is the last in-person gathering of Britain’s year-long G7 presidency, before it hands over the baton to Germany. 
Discussions were focused on Russia’s build-up of troops on Ukraine’s border, confronting China, limiting Iran’s nuclear ambitions and addressing the crisis in military-ruled Myanmar. 
“We need to come together strongly to stand up to aggressors who are seeking to limit the bounds of freedom and democracy,” British Foreign Minister Liz Truss said as she formally opened the talks, without mentioning specific countries.
“To do this, we need to have a fully united voice. We need to expand our economic and security posture around the world.” Truss held talks on the sidelines of the summit on Friday with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken as well as Germany’s new Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock.
Blinken flies on to Southeast Asia next week on a visit designed to highlight the region’s importance in Washington’s push for “peace, security and prosperity” in the Indo-Pacific region against an increasingly assertive China.
Ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will join the G7 summit for the first time ever on Sunday, in a session earmarked for wide-ranging talks on issues including Covid-19 vaccines, finance and gender equality.
South Korea, Australia, South Africa and India will also participate as Britain’s chosen G7 “guests”, with many attendees taking part virtually due to the pandemic and emergence of the Omicron variant.
Truss said before the meeting that she wanted deeper ties between G7 nations in trade, investment, technology and security “so we can defend and advance freedom and democracy across the world”.

2,Christmas tree turns symbol of hope at Brazil dump,Image of 12-year-old Gabriel Silva pulling a Christmas tree from a fetid mountain of trash goes viral on social media.,"

PINHEIRO: An illegal garbage dump seems an unlikely setting for a holiday story, but when a photojournalist captured 12-year-old Gabriel Silva pulling a Christmas tree from a fetid mountain of trash, the image quickly went viral. 
Silva lives with his mother and two older brothers in a small mud hut next to the dump in the town of Pinheiro, in northeastern Brazil. 
It is a disturbing landscape of rotting waste and discarded plastic, where dozens of trash-pickers compete for scraps of food with vultures, cats, dogs and cattle. 
Silva was with his mother on November 8, digging through the garbage as he does most days after school, when he unearthed a blue plastic bag with a small artificial Christmas tree inside. 
“I had never had a Christmas tree before,” he says. His face has an inscrutable expression in the picture that photographer Joao Paulo Guimaraes captured of that moment, as if the shirtless young trash-picker were unsure what to make of this find: it intrigued the child in him, but would do nothing to feed his family. 
But then the image went viral on social networks, and the little plastic tree turned into an unexpected Christmas present. 
Silva and his family’s dirt-floor hut now has a giant, sparkling Christmas tree inside — not the one from the dump, but a gift from a benefactor who was moved by the photograph. 
It is just one of a flood of donations the family has received. “We’ve gotten clothes, mattresses, baskets of food. Thank God, we’ll be able to get by fine for Christmas this year,” says Silva’s mother, 45-year-old Maria Francisca Silva. 
There has also been money, thanks to online collections — a windfall for Maria Francisca, who earns around 600 reais ($105) a month selling recyclable materials from the dump. 
The family hopes to soon fulfill their dream of building an actual house. 
They have already realised one longtime wish, thanks to an initial donation of 500 reais: install a hydraulic pump to bring up water from their well, replacing the rope and bucket they used to use. 
But Silva’s favourite gift is a bicycle he received from a teacher at his school.

3,Biden assails Kellogg’s plans for replacing striking workers,WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden has slammed Kellogg’s management for replacing striking workers and urged the...,"WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden has slammed Kellogg’s management for replacing striking workers and urged the breakfast cereal giant to negotiate a solution to their labour dispute. 
Biden, a longtime champion of unions, said he was “deeply troubled by reports of Kellogg’s plans to permanently replace striking workers” and vowed to “aggressively defend” collective bargaining. 
“Collective bargaining is an essential tool to protect the rights of workers that should be free from threats and intimidation from employers,” Biden said in a statement. 
The company on Tuesday announced it would replace workers after members of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union (BCTGM) rejected the latest contract offer. 
“Permanently replacing striking workers is an existential attack on the union and its members’ jobs and livelihoods,” Biden said. 
“I have long opposed permanent striker replacements and I strongly support legislation that would ban that practice.”

4,US sanctions elite paramilitary unit of Bangladesh,"The sanctions target 15 individuals and 10 entities in four countries — Bangladesh, Burma, China and North Korea.","WASHINGTON: The US government has imposed sanctions on Bangladesh’s elite paramilitary unit called Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) for “serious human rights abuse”. 
The sanctions announced on Friday, which was also the International Human Rights Day, targeted 15 individuals and 10 entities in four countries — Bangladesh, Burma, China and North Korea. 
“On International Human Rights Day, the Treasury is using its tools to expose and hold accountable perpetrators of serious human rights abuse,” said Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo. 
“Our actions, particularly those in partnership with the United Kingdom and Canada, send a message that democracies around the world will act against those who abuse the power of the state to inflict suffering and repression.” 
Widespread allegations of serious human rights abuse by RAB “threaten US national security interests by undermining the rule of law and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the economic prosperity of the people of Bangladesh,” said an official statement issued in Washington. 
RAB is a joint task force founded in 2004 and composed of members of the police, army, navy, air force and border guards seconded to the force from their respective units. Its mandate includes internal security, intelligence gathering related to criminal activities, and government-directed investigations. 
NGOs have alleged that RAB and other Bangladeshi law enforcement agencies “are responsible for more than 600 disappearances since 2009, nearly 600 extrajudicial killings since 2018, and torture,” the US Treasury said. 
“Some reports suggest these incidents target opposition party members, journalists, and human rights activists,” the statement added. 
A number of RAB officials were also designated as human rights violators. They include Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, director general, Benazir Ahmed, former director general, Khan Mohammad Azad, additional director general (operations), Tofayel Mustafa Sorwar, former additional director general (operations), Mohammad Jahangir Alam, former additional director general (operations) and Mohammad Anwar Latif Khan, former additional director general (Operations).
Bangladeshi authorities summoned the US ambassador to protest against the sanctions, AFP reported.
But Bangladeshi human rights activists welcomed the measures. “It is a perfect move by the US. But more officers who were involved in the abductions and enforced disappearances should have been included,” said Sanjida Islam, an organiser of Mayer Daak, which represents victims’ families. 
Most Bangladesh security agencies are involved in enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings, she said, but RAB was the main perpetrator and was involved in the abduction and disappearance of her brother in 2013. 
RAB has been dogged by controversies and accused of gross human rights violations, including staging gunfights to kill alleged criminals. In January 2017, a court sentenced 26 people, including 16 RAB officers, to death after they were found guilty of involvement in the abduction and murder of seven people.

5,Over 70 killed as tornadoes rip through six US states,"“The level of devastation is unlike anything that I have ever seen,"" Kentucky governor says.","WASHINGTON: A devastating swarm of tornadoes ripped through six US states, killing more than 70 people in Kentucky and leaving a trail of destroyed homes and businesses along a path that stretched more than 200 miles, officials said on Saturday. 
At least four tornadoes touched down overnight in parts of Kentucky, causing significant damage in more than a dozen counties. The primary tornado travelled more than 365km across the state, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said. 
The death toll could exceed 100, the governor told a morning news conference. “The level of devastation is unlike anything that I have ever seen,” Beshear said.   “We were pretty sure that we would lose over 50 Kentuckians, I’m now certain that that number is north of 70. It may in fact end up exceeding 100 before the day is done.” 
He said 189 National Guard personnel have been deployed to assist with the emergency response. 
Some of the worst destruction was in Mayfield, a small city of about 10,000 people in the far western part of Kentucky, where the state converges with Illinois, Missouri and Arkansas. 
About 110 people were inside a candle factory in the area when the tornado ripped through, bringing down the roof and causing mass casualties, Beshear said.
Kyanna Parsons-Perez, who was inside the factory, said the roof collapsed soon after the workers could hear and feel the hollowing winds and the lights began flickering. 
“We could feel the wind ... then we did a little rock,” Parsons-Perez told NBC. “And then boom, everything came down on us.”  
Video and photos posted on social media showed brick buildings in downtown Mayfield reduced to rubble, with parked cars nearly buried under bricks and debris. The steeple on the Graves County courthouse in Mayfield appeared to have been toppled, photos on Twitter showed. 
In the early hours, more than 56,000 people in Kentucky were without power, Beshear said. He declared a state of emergency and was deploying dozens of national guardsmen. 
The genesis of the tornado outbreak was a series of overnight thunderstorms, including a super cell storm that formed in northeast Arkansas. That storm moved from Arkansas and Missouri and into Tennessee and Kentucky. 
“Unfortunately it produced a couple of deadly tornadoes along the way. One of them may have been a long-track tornado,” Storm Prediction Centre’s meteorologist Roger Edward said.  
“The killer tornado was part of that.”  
One person was killed and five seriously injured when a tornado tore through a nursing home with 90 beds in Monette, Arkansas, a small community near the border with Missouri, according to Craighead County Judge Marvin Day. 
“It just took a direct hit from the tornado,” Day said. “We were very blessed that more people weren’t killed or injured in that. It could have been a whole lot worse.”  
A few miles away in Leachville, Arkansas, a tornado destroyed a Dollar General Store, killing one person, and laid waste to much of the city’s downtown, according to Lt. Chuck Brown of the Mississippi County Sheriff’s Office in Arkansas. 
“It really sounded like a train roaring through town.” 
In Illinois, police said there were “confirmed fatalities” after a roof partially collapsed at an Amazon.com Inc warehouse in the town of Edwardsville late on Friday. 
Rescue workers were searching for people trapped in the rubble. 
Drone footage of the warehouse showed a chaotic scene in the early morning dark, with many emergency vehicles around the area and rescuers with flashlights combing through debris. 
The roof appeared to have been peeled back off the metal skeleton of the building. 
In Tennessee, the severe weather killed at least three people, said Dean Flener, spokesman for the state’s Emergency Management Agency. Flener said two died in Lake County and one in Obion County, but did not have any information about the circumstances of the deaths.

6,Saudi reforms need critical thinking to succeed: US philosopher,DUBAI: Saudi authorities’ willingness to promote critical thinking will determine if a reform drive launched there...,"DUBAI: Saudi authorities’ willingness to promote critical thinking will determine if a reform drive launched there succeeds, American political philosopher Michael Sandel said after participating in the kingdom’s first-ever philosophy conference. 
Sandel, a Harvard University professor described by the Times Literary Supplement as the “most important and influential living philosopher”, spoke to Reuters after discussing notions of morality, justice and universal duty with Saudi students. 
Philosophy is not taught in Saudi universities and had been considered heretical thinking there for decades. 
“Engaging in philosophical discussions, especially in circumstances such as these, is a challenging, even a risky undertaking. I felt it was a risk worth taking,” Sandel said on Friday in an online interview. 
The conference was part of an offensive by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to improve the country’s image. 
Sandel said it was hard to predict what the ultimate course of the prince’s “experiment” would be. “But promoting critical thinking, I think, is at least worth trying,” he said, adding that Saudi Arabia’s younger generation seemed hungry to engage in philosophical discussions. 
“I want to encourage it, even while recognising that there is a certain risk and unpredictability to the course it may eventually take.” 
While many significant controls remain in place, Saudi authorities have eased the guardianship system, which gives men significant control over the lives of their female relatives, and lifted a ban on women driving. 
The kingdom also opened up for cinemas, concerts and tourism in a bid to diversify the economy away from oil.
Sandel said it was too early to draw conclusions about the motivation behind the reform drive. 
“Is this a genuine opening for philosophy and critical thinking? Or is it simply for... PR? I’m not sure. Only time will tell,” he said. 
“All I can say is I think that if there is a possibility of encouraging philosophy and critical thinking in Saudi Arabia, that’s a possibility worth exploring.”

7,Palestinians in West Bank villages hold municipal polls,"RAMALLAH: Palestinians in villages of occupied West Bank voted in municipal polls on Saturday, amid a boycott by the...","RAMALLAH: Palestinians in villages of occupied West Bank voted in municipal polls on Saturday, amid a boycott by the main opposition Hamas, the rulers of Gaza, in protest at the indefinite postponement of a general election. 
No legislative or presidential election has been held in the Palestinian territories for 15 years, while the last municipal vote — also boycotted by Hamas — took place in 2017. 
Of the 367 villages in the West Bank, 60 had no candidates standing and another 162 had a single list, leaving only 154 villages actually voting on Saturday. 
The spokesman for the Palestinian Central Elections Commission, Fareed Taam Allah, said that polling stations had opened in all villages scheduled to hold votes on Saturday. 
Polling stations are open until 7pm, with some 405,000 people eligible to vote, according to the elections committee. 
The municipal vote — the first of two stages, with cities and towns due to vote in March 2022 — is widely considered as inconsequential, with most candidates running as independents and Hamas not taking part. 
They are “politically unimportant because they are taking place in villages and not the big cities” yet, and are “futile” in the absence of Hamas, according to political analyst Jihad Harb. 
The armed group, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, is boycotting the vote in protest at President Mahmud Abbas’s indefinite postponement of parliamentary and presidential elections that had been scheduled for this year.

8,China brands US democracy ‘weapon of mass destruction’,Beijing vows to “resolutely resist and oppose all kinds of pseudo-democracies”.,"BEIJING: China branded US democracy a “weapon of mass destruction” on Saturday, following the US-organised Summit for Democracy which aimed to shore up like-minded allies in the face of autocratic regimes. 
China was left out of the two-day virtual summit — along with countries including Russia and Hungary — and responded by angrily accusing US President Joe Biden of stoking Cold War-era ideological divides. 
“‘Democracy’ has long become a ‘weapon of mass destruction’ used by the US to interfere in other countries,” a foreign ministry spokesperson said in an online statement, which also accused the US of having “instigated colour revolutions” overseas. 
The ministry also claimed the summit was organised by the US to “draw lines of ideological prejudice, instrumentalise and weaponise democracy... (and) incite division and confrontation.” 
Beijing vowed to “resolutely resist and oppose all kinds of pseudo-democracies”. 
Ahead of the summit, China ramped up a propaganda blitz criticising US democracy as corrupt and a failure. It touted its own version of “whole-process people’s democracy” in a white paper released last week that aimed to shore up legitimacy for the ruling Communist Party. 
While the US has repeatedly denied there will be a cold war with China, tensions between the world’s two largest economies have spiralled in recent years over issues including trade and technological competition, human rights, Xinjiang and Taiwan. 
The US Treasury on Friday sanctioned two high-level Chinese officials for alleged human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region and placed Chinese AI surveillance firm SenseTime on a blacklist for its facial recognition technology targeting the Uyghur minority.

9,Banksy creates T-shirt to help statue-toppling defendants,The four defendants have been charged over the toppling of a statue of a slave trader in Bristol.,"LONDON: People lined up on Saturday in the English city of Bristol to get the latest work by elusive street artist Banksy, a T-shirt created to help four defendants charged over the toppling of a local statue of a slave trader. 
The grey shirt features the word Bristol above an empty plinth like the one on which the statue of 17th-century slave merchant Edward Colston long stood. 
Anti-racism demonstrators pulled down the statue and dumped it in Bristol harbour in June 2020 amid global protests over the police killing of a Black American man, George Floyd. 
Four people have been charged with criminal damage over the statues’ felling and are due to go on trial next week. 
“I’ve made some souvenir shirts to mark the occasion,” Banksy said on social media on Friday. “Available from various outlets in the city from tomorrow. All proceeds to the defendants so they can go for a pint.” 
The T-shirts cost 25 pounds and are limited to one per customer. 
Banksy’s identity has never been confirmed, but he began his career spray-painting walls and bridges in Bristol, a port city in southwest England. Some of his works have sold for millions of dollars at auction.
