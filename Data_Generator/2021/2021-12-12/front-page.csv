LAHORE: Prime Minister Imran Khan has yet again ruled out any reconciliation with looters and launderers of public money — his oft-employed reference to former premier Nawaz Sharif. 
A nation can never rise or progress if it gives NRO (clean chit, in reference to the National Reconciliation Ordinance) to looters, the prime minister said, stressing: “My government will neither give an NRO nor reconcile with the looters of public money.” 
“I, however, will talk to those who have an ideology or those who belong to the left or right wing politics for the resolution of the country’s problems,” Mr Khan said while addressing a public meeting in Mianwali on Saturday. 
The prime minister asserted that he was ready to talk to people and peacefully resolve issues being confronted by the people of Balochistan, Waziristan and tribal areas. 
He regretted that Pakistan, despite being an independent country, was never able to take independent decisions and played a slave to some nation or the other. “Now, this country will take only those decisions that will be in the interest of Pakistanis,” Mr Khan vowed. 
He said he would ensure that looters of public money were punished because the nations that entered into deals with looters collapsed. “Every disciplined society keeps its thieves and dacoits in jails while ensuring supremacy of the law,” he remarked. 
Mr Khan said he would make Pakistan a great nation by following two cardinal principles – rule of law and making it a welfare state. 
He also spoke at length about the cause of price hike in Pakistan as well as the world over and hoped the prices would come down in three to four months. He went on to say the coronavirus pandemic had resulted in lockdowns and slowing down of business and economic activity, adding the US faced the highest inflation in history since 1982 and Pakistan had relatively not touched the highest inflation rate. The increased prices of oil, gas, coal and ghee resulted in a hike in rates of daily-use items that hit the masses hard. He further said the electricity prices also pushed people against the wall and blamed the previous governments for signing costly deals. 
Mr Khan said the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government had launched the Health Card that will be handed out to each head of a family in Punjab to avail quality healthcare in public and private hospitals for their families up to Rs1 million. The cards would reach every person in Punjab between January and March, he added. 
He also explained about different interest-free loan projects and the Ehsaas Ration scheme to offer daily-use items to the poor at a 30 per cent subsidy. 
The prime minister said he would ensure that the areas deliberately kept backward by previous governments would be given massive funds to make them part of national development. 
Mr Khan inaugurated three projects worth Rs5.4 billion as well as performed ground-breaking of 23 development schemes in health, education and road infrastructure that would be completed with around Rs36bn for the uplift of Mianwali district. 
He also asked the youth of Mianwali to actively participate in the upcoming local government elections and work for the welfare and development of the district. 
Earlier, Chief Minister Usman Buzdar said a District Development Package valuing Rs360bn had been introduced in Punjab’s budget to ensure the development of all areas, including Thal, Cholistan and Koh-i-Suleman. “Punjab’s Rs740bn development budget is the highest in its history,” he claimed. 
Mr Buzdar said the provincial government had announced 100,000 jobs and the vacancies would be filled soon. He further said the provincial government was establishing 21 universities, upgrading 27,000 schools, setting up 6,000 record centres, developed 13 economic zones and approved 16 cement factories. 
MNA Amjad Ali Khan requested the prime minister for construction of a canal in Mohar area, linking the area with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor through an interchange and development of industrial zones.

1,Ali to oversee affairs as petroleum secretary Arshad axed,The federal govt has assigned the charge of the office to Power Division Secretary Ali Raza Bhutta.,"ISLAMABAD: The federal government on Satur­day removed Petroleum Division Secretary Dr Arshad Mehmood and assigned the charge of the office to Power Division Secretary Ali Raza Bhutta.  
According to a notification issued by the Estab­lishment Division, “Dr Arshad Meh­mood a BS-22 officer of Pakistan Adminis­trative Service, presently posted as Secretary Petroleum Division, is transferred and directed to report to the Establishment Division”.  
Interestingly, Mr Mehmood has not been assigned any posting. His services will remain at the disposal of Establishment Division until further orders.  
As a makeshift arrangement, the Petroleum Division will be looked after by another bureaucrat.  
Another notification of the Establishment Division regarding the additional charge of Mr Bhutta stated: “Ali Raza Bhutta, a BS-22 officer of Pakistan Administrative Service presently posted as Secretary Power Division, is assigned additional charge of the post of Secretary Petroleum Division for a period of three months or till the posting of regular incumbent; whichever is earlier, and with immediate effect.”  
While there is no official statement about the ‘sudden’ removal of the petroleum secretary, the energy ministry reportedly is being criticised for referring to only one business group as the panacea for all energy challenges, including those relating to LPG production, pipelines for LNG supplies and facilitation to additional business-to-business arrangements within the existing LNG terminals.
The smaller groups like the compressed natural gas sector are being pushed to bow to this instead of seeking their own imports, it is said. In the process, a major Japanese player which may have led to market competition through additional terminal capacity appears to have been forced out at the last moment.

2,Sindh PA removes provision of secret ballot from LG law,Opposition members stage walkout after protest over controversial law,"KARACHI: Amid opposition members’ strong protest, the Sindh Assembly on Saturday removed the provisions of ‘secret ballot’ and election of ‘any person’ as mayor, deputy mayor, chairman and vice chairman of a council instead of elected members from the Sindh Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2021.  
The situation took an ugly turn when Local Government Minister Syed Nasir Hussain Shah moved the motion for reconsideration of the bill and Opposition Leader Haleem Adil Sheikh demanded a discussion on the bill before its reconsideration.  
Speaker Agha Siraj Durrani, however, did not allow any opposition member to speak on the bill.  
Opposition members belonging to the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan, Grand Democratic Alliance and Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal joined the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s protest and gathered in front of the chair chanting slogans of “Na Manzoor, Na Manzoor” (not acceptable) and tearing up copies of the agenda and throwing them at the chair and leader of the house.  

Opposition members stage walkout after protest over controversial law

Some members of the PTI and the PPP aggressively moved towards each other, pushing and hurling harsh words. They, however, were separated by other legislators.  
The opposition parties staged a walkout from the house as the speaker allowed Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah to make a statement immediately after the amended bill was passed.  
Lambasting the opposition for protesting and staging a walkout against the amended local government law, Mr Shah said that nothing was worse than an illiterate and uneducated opposition. “The bill has been amended as per the governor’s recommendations and it will again be sent to him for his assent,” he told the treasury benches as none of the opposition member was present in the house.  
The chief minister said that the bill was passed in urgency as the Election Commission Pakistan had set Nov 30 deadline for the provincial government to provide prerequisites for holding local government elections in the province. “There is still room for further amendments to the bill,” he added.  
In an apparent jibe at the MQM-P, Mr Shah said that the opposition party was indulging in linguistic politics. “The one who created linguistic differences is sitting in London. You have disowned him but have not dissociated from his ideology,” he lamented.  
“Love Sindh. You are from Sindh,” he continued.   
He said that the bill had been presented in the house after all stakeholders were consulted. The chief minister said that the bill was in line with the people’s wishes. “The observations made by the governor have been incorporated in the bill by and large,” he said and added that more amendments could be made to the LG law, if need arose.  
The chief minister said that town municipal committees or towns were created on the recommendation of the opposition parties, including the MQM-P and Jamaat Islami.  
He also criticised what he called “illiterate and uneducated” federal government and said it had unleashed the tsunami of price hike. “The selected who is sitting at the top should seek pardon from the people of the country and quit,” the chief minister said.  
The assembly also passed the Sindh Solid Waste Management Bill, 2021, making mayors of metropolitan and municipal corporations co-chairpersons of the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board along with the LG minister.  
The assembly also passed the Sindh Civil Courts (Amendment) Bill, 2021 and the Sindh Factories (Second Amendment) Bill, 2021.  
At the outset, Speaker Durrani who was attending the session on production order as he has been arrested by NAB in assets beyond known sources of income case, said he had been subjected to media trial. He said that if the country’s economy would improve by keeping him in prison, he was ready to spend his whole life behind the bars.  
Later, the session was prorogued.

3,Policeman martyred in TTP gun attack,DERA ISMAIL KHAN: A policeman was martyred and a security official suffered injuries when unidentified attackers...,"DERA ISMAIL KHAN: A policeman was martyred and a security official suffered injuries when unidentified attackers opened fire on them while they were guarding a polio vaccination team in Tank district on Saturday.

4,Afghan Taliban reject TTP’s claim it’s part of IEA,Advise TTP to focus on stability to prevent external interference; urge Pakistan to look into the banned outfit’s demands,"KARACHI: The Afghan Taliban have rejected the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claim that it is a ‘branch’ of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA), the regime in charge in Kabul, asserting that the two organisations do not share the same objectives. 
These views were expressed by Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Muja­hid, in an interview with Arab News on Friday, apparently in response to the recent assertion by the TTP through a video.  
In the video available on social media, TTP chief Mufti Noor Wali Mahsud claimed his outfit came under the larger ‘umbrella’ of the IEA. “Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan is a branch of Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, [and] is a part of that umbrella on this land,” Mahsud, accompanied by armed militants, can be seen saying in the video as he addressed a group of men. 
However, the Afghan Taliban spokesperson, according to Dawn.com, rejected Mahsud’s claim of affiliation with the Islamic Emirate. Earlier, Arab News quoted Mujahid as saying: “They are not, as an organisation, part of IEA and we don’t share the same objectives.”   

Advise TTP to focus on stability to prevent external interference; urge Pakistan to look into the banned outfit’s demands  

He said: “We advise TTP to focus on peace and stability in their country. This is very important so they can prevent any chance for enemies to interfere in the region and in Pakistan. And we request Pakistan to look into their demands for the better of the region and Pakistan.” 
The Afghan Taliban spokesperson said the TTP was Pakistan’s internal matter.  
“The IEA stance is that we do not interfere in other countries’ affairs. We do not interfere in Pakistan’s affairs,” he claimed roughly a month after Afghanistan’s acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi acknowledged that the Afghan Taliban were mediating between the TTP and Pakistan on the desire of both sides. 
Ceasefire
The Afghan Taliban’s facilitation of talks had led to a month-long ceasefire during November, which the TTP declined to extend any further, accusing the government of failing to honour the decisions reached earlier. 
A statement issued by the TTP on Thursday gave out details of the six-point agreement that it said it had reached with the government under the aegis of the IEA on Oct 25, 2021. 
The two sides, according to the agreement, had accepted that the IEA would play the role of a mediator and that both sides would form five-member committees each which, under the supervision of the mediator, would discuss the next course of action and demands of each sides. 
Both sides, it said, had also agreed to observe a month-long ceasefire from Nov 1 to Nov 30, 2021 and that the government would release 102 “imprisoned mujahideen” and hand them over to the TTP through the “IEA and that both sides would issue a joint statement regarding the ceasefire on Nov 1, 2021”. 
According to the TTP, the government failed to implement the decisions, as security forces conducted raids in Dera Ismail Khan, Lakki Marwat, Swat, Bajaur, Swabi and North Waziristan and killed and detained militants. “Under these circumstances, it is not possible to extend the ceasefire,” the TTP claimed. 
The decision to end the ceasefire is a big setback to government’s efforts to secure a peace agreement with the militants waging war against the state.
