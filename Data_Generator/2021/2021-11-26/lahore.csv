0,Punjab finally relieves 10 officials under rotation policy,"In the past, the then governments would offer strong resistance to comply with the transfer orders of the establishment division.","LAHORE: The Punjab government finally ‘succumbed to the pressure’ of the Establishment Division and relieved 10 officers of BS-20 belonging to the Pakistan Administrative Service (PAS) and Police Service of Pakistan of duties to report to other provinces here on Thursday.
It was said to be the first transfer order [issued by the ED] under the Rotation Policy 2020 which followed 100 per cent compliance.
In the past, the then governments of Pervez Musharaf and the PML-N in Punjab have been offering strong resistance to comply with the transfer orders of the establishment division.  
They had been picking up the officers of choice to retain their postings in the province, creating a strong resentment among other officials who had declared the implementation of the policy a result of ‘pick and choose’ or ‘favouritism’.
Contrary to the previous steps, the recent transfer orders of the PAS/PSP officers were fully backed by Prime Minister Imran Khan.
Many official correspondences were also reported between the federal and the provincial governments to get the transfer orders implemented.
It is evident from an official letter of the Establishment Division, Islamabad, wherein the Punjab government was asked to ensure implementation of the transfer orders in letter and spirit, giving a warning to the officers too that they would have to face wrath of the authorities concerned for not leaving the province.  
“Any delay in the matter is likely to impact the officers adversely,” reads the ED’s last letter addressed to Punjab Chief Secretary Kamran Ali Afzal a couple of days back.
It also left a message for the Punjab government. “Any compromise on this issue will result in you and I compromising on and undermining the policy.”
Separately, Punjab had also been conveyed that the prime minister was fully on board on the transfers of the officers and no other alternative would be entertained at any cost.
(A copy of the official letter and the Punjab government’s relieving orders is available with Dawn). Out of the PSPs who were serving on important slots in Punjab, the transfer of additional IG Special Branch Punjab Zaeem Iqbal Sheikh and Headquarters DIG Mohammad Zubair Dreshak was being viewed as a major development. 
An official privy to the information said the Punjab government’s decision to relieve the two officers kicked off a debate in police circles.
He said they were among others who had been enjoying important positions and were ‘least rotated’ during their service in Punjab.  
Relieving Mr Sheikh and Mr Dreshak of their duties, the Punjab government directed them to report to Sindh as per the transfer orders issued by the ED.  
Three DIG rank police officers were serving as regional police officers (RPOs) in Punjab and the government relieved them of their duties.  
Similarly, Multan RPO Syed Khurram Ali and Sheikhupura RPO Dr Inam Waheed were directed to report to the Sindh government and Sahiwal RPO Ahmad Arslan to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.  
Additional IG Traffic Police Punjab Sohail Akhtar Sukhera has also been relieved of his duties and directed to report to the Sindh government.
In the relieving orders of the PAS officers, Punjab Management and Special Development Department Secretary Ali Tahir has been directed to join his new assignment under the Balochistan government, Punjab Finance Secretary retired Flt- Lt Iftikhar Ali Sahoo to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.  
Sargodha Commissioner Ms Farah Masood has been directed to join her new assignment as joint secretary of the climate change division.  
DG Khan Commissioner Sarah Aslam has also been relieved of her duty and directed to join her new assignment under the Balochistan government.

At a press conference, LHCBA president Maqsood Buttar said judges were not supposed to get involved in political activities of the bar.  
Professional Group head Hamid Khan and former bar president Shafqat Mahmood Chohan also joined Buttar at the conference.

They said the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), being a top political wing of the legal fraternity, needed to maintain its neutral role and as a co-host, it failed to manage the affairs responsibly.  
Mr Khan said there had been a tradition that the bar would not hold conferences in collaboration with private organisations or NGOs. He said the bar was not supposed to toe the agenda of any political party but support law and the Constitution.
However, he supported the views expressed by Ali Ahmad Kurd, former president of the SCBA, regarding functioning of the judiciary. He said the judiciary should be free from any pressure and influence from any quarter.  
The lawyers also demanded that the Supreme Judicial Council initiate action against the judges participating in the politics of the bar.
They said fingers were being raised in bars, public and media on the role of the judiciary which was a matter of concern.
They said passing decisions on the basis of personal liking or disliking amounted to judicial misconduct by the judges. They said the appointment process for the judges in the superior judiciary required to be more transparent.  
The Hamid Khan group announced that it would hold a national-level conference soon.

“It pains me watching the nation queuing up for sugar, flour, and petrol. The poor are getting closer to death because of this government while Imran Niazi’s cruelty and apathy are rubbing salt into the wounds of the masses,” he said in a statement here on Thursday. 
Shehbaz said the entire country was trapped in the ‘smog of Imran’s incompetence and corruption’ for over three years.  
“Ration cards, queues, inflation, U-turns, lies, corruption and incompetence are the hallmarks of this so-called New Pakistan,” he said and added that every single crisis in the country from flour and sugar to petrol and gas was a product of Imran’s corruption, incompetence and mismanagement. 
The opposition leader said gas was already hit by shortage while the PTI government had planned to increase the gas tariff by 400pc. Domestic and commercial users would pay hundreds more as the government was going to raise the cost from Rs1,400MMBTu to Rs 1700MMBTu, he lamented. 
Shehbaz Sharif said dollar rate was going up and for every Re1 drop in value of currency, inflation raised from 14 to 16 basic points. He said he was astounded by Imran’s shamelessness who had forgotten all about his lectures on political morality and anti-devaluation and anti-inflation sermons from the container. 
Meanwhile, a delegation of the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (PILDAT), led by Ahmed Bilal Mahboob, called on Shehbaz Sharif at his residence here in which PML-N secretary general Ahsan Iqbal Ahsan Iqbal and Marriyum Aurangzeb were also present. 
The electronic voting machines (EVMs), constitutional and electoral reforms, and ways of conducting a transparent, free and fair election were discussed in the meeting. 
Mr Shehbaz said the youth were the future of Pakistan and they were disheartened and repelled by politics, which would weaken democracy in the country. 
Meanwhile, talking to the reporters here, Ahsan Iqbal said the government was planning to give autonomy to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) under a deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  
“Such a move will prevent the central bank from probing hot money scandals that come to light in the future,” he added.

5,Filling stations’ partial strike in city keeps people guessing,"Reports of complete closure, overcharging pour in from some dists...","LAHORE: Citizens faced inconvenience due to partial strike of the petrol filling stations on Thursday.  
Long queues of motorists were witnessed in several areas where people could get fuel after at least half an hour or so. The traffic on the roads, however, remained thin. 
Most filling stations at Empress Road, Peco Road, UET, GT Road, Model Town Link Road, Faisal Town, Garden Town and Ferozepur Road stopped giving petrol to people after 6am.  
The All Pakistan Petrol Pumps Dealers Association on Wednesday announced a nationwide strike and closure of fuel stations from Thursday morning for an indefinite period over the government’s failure to increase the profit margin to six per cent.  

Reports of complete closure, overcharging pour in from some dists

The citizens were of the view that the government was not timely taking measures to address the issue of the petrol dealers and it could create problems for them.  
Deputy Commissioner Umar Sher Chattha claimed that he had visited various petrol pumps in the city to assess the situation and found that 62 of them were fully operating. He said the oil companies’ petrol pumps were fully operational, as were those of the Punjab government and those operating under public-private partnerships.  
He said the district administration was taking measures to ensure supply of petroleum products to the citizens.  
Association’s Punjab chapter spokesperson Jahanzaib Malik told Dawn that a team led by Federal Minister for Finance Shaukat Tareen had contacted their chairman but still they were negotiating. He said the strike would continue till the acceptance of their demand of increasing the profit margin.  
“We are spending Rs4.25 per litre of petrol and the government is giving Rs3.91 margin and also deducting Rs0.65 as withholding tax,” he said.  
People faced problems in many parts of Punjab.  
In Bahawalpur, the motorists failed to get the fuel and found the filling stations covered with tents. No government-run petrol pump was open contrary to the claims of the government.  
Association’s district president Muhammad Yaseen claimed that the strike was successful and would help put pressure on the government to accept their just demand of six per cent commission. He said the association was alive to the trouble of the consumers but had no option other than highlighting the issue.  
Makeshift petrol sellers cashed in on the strike and sold fuel to the motorists at high prices in Okara.  
Officials failed to crackdown on the sellers who, according to reports, demanded as high as Rs200 per litre from the vehicle owners at some places. The filling stations remained closed and covered their sale points with tents.  
There was a similar situation at other places including Sargodha where the Petroleum Dealers Association observed complete strike. Association president Raufur Rehman and general secretary Mansoor Shahzad said the dealers would not succumb to pressure as they had taken the extreme step as a last resort.

He said the police high-ups transferred blind murder case to the CIA which deputed a team headed by a DSP rank officer.
He said the CIA officials obtained the record of cameras that showed the suspected biker making an entry into a blind alley of a densely populated locality of Lahore, while refusing to disclose name of the area due to some reasons.

10,LHC seeks reply from DC on plea seeking fireproof set-up for land record,The petitioner urges the court to pass an appropriate order to the government to ensure measures for protecting land records.,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Thursday sought a reply from the deputy commissioner of the provincial metropolis on a public interest petition seeking implementation of a law requiring the government to ensure fireproof arrangements for the land record.
Advocate Chaudhry Abdul Sattar, the petitioner, contended before the court that sub-section (3) of section 16 of the Registration Act 1908 provided that the provincial government shall supply the office of every registrar with a fire-proof box, and shall in each district make suitable provision for the safe custody of the records connected with the registration of documents in such district.  
He pointed out that an unruly mob on Jan 12, 1998 set on fire the property registration record of the Saddar Sub-division in the DC Office, Lahore, resulting into its complete burning.  
He argued that had the government taken care to do what the law had required it to do, the property registration record could have been saved from burning.
The lawyer said he himself was a victim like thousands of other victims of the government’s grave neglect that it did not care to do a doable.
He submitted that the inferno-havoc could not open the eyes of the government and the height of the bad governance was that now when almost quarter of a century had since passed, it seemed to be no one’s concern to go by the law.
He asked the court to take notice of the situation and pass an appropriate order to the government for the implementation of the law.  
Justice Shahid Jamil Khan directed a law officer to seek instructions from the deputy commissioner and place the same before the court on the next hearing.

Following the cabinet approval, the Nawaz Sharif Medical College (NSMC), Gujrat, and Sargodha Medical College (SMC) will get autonomy from the management of the University of Gujrat (UoG) and University of Sargodha (UoS), respectively, as students, faculty and management of these colleges have long been demanding the autonomous status.  
NSMC Principal Dr Zafar Gill told Dawn that the cabinet in its 49th meeting held on Tuesday had approved the transfer of the medical colleges to the specialised healthcare and medical education department.
The NSMC and SMC had been established under a unique arrangement in 2009-10 according to which these colleges were made constituent institutes of UoG and UoS, respectively, but these colleges were affiliated with University of Health Sciences whereas their teaching hospitals were being controlled by the provincial health department.
Under the arrangement, these institutions had been suffering a lot as the administration of teaching hospitals was noT answerable to the management of medical colleges whereas the faculty and staff had also been working under administration of respective universities that vice chancellors had been the appointing authorities of the principals of constituent medical colleges.
Dr Gill said with transfer of medical colleges to the health department, both the faculty of these colleges and the administration of the teaching hospitals would be under the control of one department which would help resolve the issues like shortage of faculty and resources.
