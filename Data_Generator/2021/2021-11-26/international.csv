0,"Merkel gives stark warning as Germany’s Covid death toll tops 100,000",Germany has seen a recent resurgence of the pandemic with intensive care beds rapidly filling up.,"BERLIN: German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued an urgent warning on pandemic management on Thursday to the new government coming in to succeed her, imploring it to take quick, decisive measures as the country’s total death toll passed 100,000.
Speaking one day after Olaf Scholz presented his new centre-left-led ruling coalition due to take office next month, the outgoing Merkel told reporters that “every day counts” as Germany continues to smash daily coronavirus infection records.
“We need more contact restrictions,” Merkel said, adding that she had “today clearly told” Scholz that “we can still manage this transition period together and look at all necessary measures”.
Calling Thursday a “sad day” over the grim death toll, Merkel, a trained scientist, said she had sought dialogue with Scholz, a Social Democrat, and the leaders of his coalition partners Greens and the libertarian FDP because of the gravity of the situation.
Germany weathered earlier bouts of the pandemic better than many other European countries, but has seen a recent resurgence, with intensive care beds rapidly filling up.
Europe’s largest economy recorded 351 Covid fatalities in the past 24 hours, bringing the official death toll since the start of the pandemic to 100,119.
The weekly incidence rate also hit an all-time high of 419.7 new infections per 100,000 people, the Robert Koch Institute health agency said.
The escalating health crisis poses a baptism of fire for the new government. The country has been stuck in political limbo since the September 26 general election, with the popular Merkel governing only in a caretaker capacity.
Her Health Minister Jens Spahn warned this week that most Germans would be “vaccinated, cured or dead” from Covid-19 by winter’s end, as he urged more citizens to get jabbed.
The spike in Germany comes as Europe has re-emerged as the pandemic’s epicentre, with the continent battling sluggish vaccine uptake in some nations, the highly contagious Delta variant, colder weather sending people indoors and the easing of restrictions.
A tally of official figures showed on Thursday that more than 1.5 million people have died from Covid-19 in Europe.
Scholz began a presentation of his new government’s policy roadmap on Wednesday by announcing new measures to tame the fourth wave.
These included forming a corona response task force based at his office and earmarking one billion euros ($1.12 billion) in bonuses for overstretched health workers on the front lines.
Greens co-leader Annalena Baerbock told public broadcaster ARD the incoming coalition would take 10 days, until early December, to decide whether “the protective measures go far enough”.
However that timetable has already been criticised as far too little and too late.
“The latest decisions are like announcing in a flooding catastrophe a plan to hire more swimming teachers and distributing a few water wings and rubber ducks,” Sueddeutsche newspaper fumed.
“The coalition has big plans, but what use are they if we are all locked down over Christmas with thousands dying each day?” As the fourth wave rages, the German health sector has had to call on hospitals elsewhere in the EU for help.
Germany last week began requiring people to prove they are vaccinated, have recovered from Covid-19 or recently tested negative before they can travel on public transport or enter workplaces.
Several of the worst-hit areas have gone further, cancelling large events like Christmas markets and barring the unvaccinated from bars, gyms and leisure facilities.

1,Australia deploys peacekeepers as riots rock Solomon Islands,"The archipelago nation of around 700,000 people has for decades been beset by ethnic and political tensions.","

HONIARA: Australia rus­h­ed peacekeepers to the Solo­mon Islands on Thur­sday, hoping to quell riots that threatened to topple the Pacific nation’s government and left its capital ablaze.
After a second day of widespread protests and looting in Honiara, Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare called on neighbouring Australia for help.
The first contingent of a 100-strong Australian police and military force arrived late Thursday, according to local media, as a defiant Sogavare said that although the country had been “brought to its knees” by unrest, he would not resign.
The archipelago nation of around 700,000 people has for decades been beset by ethnic and political tensions.
The latest bout of unrest began on Wednesday when thousands of protesters besieged parliament, setting fire to an outbuilding and calling for Sogavare’s ouster.
Since then the protests have quickly descended into a violent free-for-all, with gangs of stick-wielding youths rampaging through the capital, stripping stores of goods and clashing with police.
“There’s mobs moving around, it’s very tense,” one resident said, asking not to be named.
By late Thursday thousands of looters openly defied police lockdown orders, running through the streets carrying boxes, crates and bulging sacks of goods as flames crackled around them and plumes of thick black smoke billowed high above the city.
Images published on social media showed buildings engulfed in flames, shopfronts smouldering and corrugated roofs twisted and collapsed in the capital.
Debris, including trash and tree branches, was strewn across the streets.
Banks, schools, police stations, offices and Chinese-owned businesses were among the buildings reportedly torched.
In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian expressed “grave concern” and called on the Solomon Islands government “to take all necessary measures to protect the safety of Chinese citizens and organisations”.
The unrest has been sparked by pandemic-fuelled economic frustrations and a long-running rivalry between residents of the country’s most populous island Malaita and the Guadalcanal-based central government.
In the late 1990s Guadalcanal militants launched attacks on settlers, particularly targeting those from Malaita, and for five years unrest plagued the country.
The so-called “Tensions” only eased with the deployment of an Australian-led peacekeeping mission — named the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the latest Australian deployment was expected to last “a matter of weeks”, unlike Canberra’s previous peacekeeping mission, which ran from 2003 to 2017 and cost about US$2.2 billion.
“It is not the Australian government’s intention in any way to intervene in the internal affairs of the Solomon Islands, that is for them to resolve,” he said. “Our purpose here is to provide stability and security.” Malaita residents continue to complain that their island is neglected by the central government.
Since 2019 the feud has been turbocharged by a row over Sogavare’s decision to abruptly break diplomatic relations with Taiwan and recognise Beijing.

2,India has more women than men for the first time,"NEW DELHI: India has more women than men for the first time on record, according to government data that also showed...","NEW DELHI: India has more women than men for the first time on record, according to government data that also showed a slowing birthrate in the world’s second-most populous nation.
Parents in India have historically favoured sons over daughters, who are often considered burdensome and costly due to the tradition of wedding dowries.
Sex-selective abortions have been outlawed but the practice has persisted, and national population data has consistently recorded one of the world’s highest ratios of men to women.
But the latest National Family and Health Survey, released by the health ministry on Wednesday, recorded 1,020 women per 1,000 men after two years of research.
This is the first time any significant government population survey has shown more women than men in India, dating back to the first national census in 1876.
“The improvement in total sex ratio is positive and a step in the right direction but much still needs to be done towards gender equality,” Population Foundation of India (PFI) health scientist Sanghamitra Singh said.
The difference is explained by womens’ longer life expectancy, with more boys still being born than girls — 1,000 males for every 929 females. “That could indicate some degree of son preference,” Singh said. The data also showed India’s fertility rate had fallen to two children per woman, down from 2.2 in the last survey from 2015-16.
That figure is below the replacement level needed to maintain population levels, which PFI hailed as a “significant feat for the country’s family-planning programme”.
India is home to around 1.3 billion people and UN projections forecast the country’s population to overtake China later this decade. The survey’s data was drawn from around 600,000 households across India.
Singh said a clearer picture would emerge after India completed its Covid-delayed census, originally due for publication this year.

3,Indian court commutes death sentences in rape case,"Three men in Mumbai, along with two accomplices, had trapped and repeatedly raped a photojournalist while she was on assignment.","MUMBAI: Mumbai’s top court on Thursday commuted the death sentences of three men convicted in a rape case that heightened public outrage over women’s safety in India.
The assault in 2013 followed another high-profile gang-rape case the previous year that left a woman dead in New Delhi, sparking nationwide protests resulting in tougher anti-rape laws.
The three men in Mumbai, along with two accomplices, trapped and repeatedly raped a 22-year-old photojournalist while she was on assignment at an abandoned factory compound.
The Shakti Mills complex stands next to a fashionable area of apartments, office blocks, shops and restaurants in India’s financial centre.
The attack dismayed residents of Mumbai, a metropolis considered far safer for women than the capital New Delhi, sparking protests in the city and uproar in the national parliament. Mumbai police arrested all five within a week of the incident.
It prompted a 19-year-old telephone operator to come forward and accuse the trio of also raping her in the same place a month earlier, along with two different accomplices.
All seven accused — two of them juveniles — were convicted over the two rapes.
The 2012 New Delhi case prompted a change in the law to make repeat rapists eligible for the death penalty.

4,UN launches effort to end violence against women by 2030,"“Change is possible, and now is the time to redouble our efforts,"" says UN Secretary General António Guterres.","UNITED NATIONS: UN Secretary General António Guterres urged governments on Thursday to redouble their efforts for ending violence against women by 2030 as the world began 16 days of activism to highlight the issue.
“Violence against women is not inevitable,” the UN chief said in a message. “Change is possible, and now is the time to redouble our efforts so that together, we can eliminate violence against women and girls by 2030.”
For thirty years, the United Nations observes the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and this year it also kick-started 15 days of activism to highlight the issue across the globe.
In Washington, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken described gender-based violence as the ‘shadow pandemic’ and emphasised the need to combat it as an emergency.
“We recommit to preventing and responding to gender-based violence as a moral and strategic imperative, as a fairness and equity issue, and as a driver of our collective prosperity and security,” he said.
In New York, UN Women chief Sima Bahous said gender-based violence (GBV) was a global crisis. “In all of our own neighbourhoods, there are women and girls living in danger.
Around the world, conflict, climate-related natural disasters, food insecurity and human rights violations are exacerbating violence against women,” she said.
The United Nations also issued a report, pointing out that more than 70 percent women have experienced violence in some crisis settings.
The report shows that in both rich and poor countries alike, gender prejudice has fuelled acts of violence towards women and girls. And this violence “often goes unreported, silenced by stigma, shame, fear of the perpetrators and fear of a justice system that does not work for women,” Ms Bahous said.
According to this report: Nearly 1 in 3 women experience violence at some stage and during crises, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, the violence increases.
Data from 13 countries since the pandemic, shows that 2 in 3 women reported living in fear of violence and food insecurity during the pandemic. Only 1 in 10 women said that victims would go to the police for help.
Stopping this violence starts with believing survivors, adopting comprehensive and inclusive approaches that tackle the root causes, transform harmful social norms, and empower women and girls. With survivor-centred essential services across policing, justice, health, and social sectors, and sufficient financing for the women’s rights agenda, “we can end gender-based violence,” the UN report adds.
The UN also suggests long-term strategies that tackle the root causes of violence, protecting the rights of women and girls, and promoting strong and autonomous women’s rights movements.
UN partner countries last year witnessed a 22 per cent increase in prosecution of perpetrators; 84 laws and policies were passed or strengthened; and more than 650,000 women and girls were able to access help – despite pandemic-related restrictions.

WOODSTOCK: Hanging halfway up an ancient oak tree, peering into a small, dark hole in its enormous trunk abuzz with bees, Filipe Salbany can barely contain himself.
“Amazing — the queen’s laying!” the 55-year-old shouts down, as he dangles around 15 metres (just under 50 feet) above the grounds of Blenheim Estate, secured by ropes and a harness.
“This is a real classroom. This is fantastic. Unbelievable!” The South African conservationist has spent much of the last 18 months scouring for hives in the ancient woodlands of the estate, near Oxford, in south central England.
His unbridled enthusiasm stems from his belief that these are no ordinary bees.
He has identified them as a rare ecotype — a distinct form of a species, occupying a particular habitat — with a suspected centuries-old lineage in the self-contained corner of the Oxfordshire countryside.
DNA tests are now under way to confirm the finding, but the potential discovery of wild descendents of so-called native bees has Blenheim and beyond buzzing with excitement. It was thought such populations had largely disappeared due to disease, pesticides and competition with foreign imports.
Salbany believes their continued existence has global implications.
“If we can do this in more ancient woodland, different countries, if we can find local subspecies of bees... we can learn so much more about the environment and improve agricultural systems,” he said from his tree perch.
“Whether it’s Romania, Bulgaria, France, we need to look at the species that are surviving and understand the factors that are affecting the bees, whether it’s chemicals, pesticides, human intervention.

6,Interpol elects UAE general accused of torture as president,"ISTANBUL: Interpol elected an Emirati general accused of torture as its new president on Thursday, despite the...","ISTANBUL: Interpol elected an Emirati general accused of torture as its new president on Thursday, despite the concerns of human rights organisations who fear the agency will be at risk of exploitation by repressive regimes.
The appointment follows generous funding by the United Arab Emirates for the Lyon, France-based body and accusations that Abu Dhabi has abused Interpol’s system of so-called “red notices” for wanted suspects to persecute political dissidents.
Emirati General Ahmed Nasser Al Raisi was elected following three rounds of voting during which he received 68.9 per cent of votes cast by member countries, Interpol said in a statement.
After his election, Raisi tweeted he would “build a more transparent, diverse, and decisive organisation that works to ensure safety for all”.
However, he did not address the accusations, but said the “UAE has become one of the safest countries in the world”. Complaints of “torture” were filed against the Emirati general in recent months in France and Turkey, which is hosting Interpol’s general assembly in Istanbul this week.
Raisi, head of the UAE’s security forces, will take on a largely ceremonial and part-time voluntary role for a four-year term.
Interpol Secretary General Juergen Stock handles day-to-day running of the organisation. He was appointed for a second five-year term in 2019.
South Korean Kim Jong-yang was president since the 2018 arrest of his predecessor Meng Hongwei in China, where he had served as a vice minister of public security.
The only other candidate for the post was the Czech Republic’s Sarka Havrankova, a veteran officer overseeing the country’s international cooperation in police matters.
Another appointment to Interpol’s executive committee on Thursday — Chinese senior public security official, Hu Binchen — similarly sparked anger.
Swedish activist and Safeguard Defenders co-founder, Peter Dahlin, said the election was a “disgrace that will increase China’s abuse [of Uyghur people]” in a tweet.
Raisi joined the Emirati police force in 1980 and worked there for several decades.
Gulf researcher for Human Rights Watch, Hiba Zayadin, condemned the election of “a representative of arguably the most authoritarian government in the Gulf”, describing it on Twitter as a “sad day for human rights and the rule of law worldwide”.
Three European Parliament members had written a letter dated November 11 to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to warn that Raisi’s election “would undermine the mission and reputation of Interpol”.
One of the complainants against Raisi, British national Matthew Hedges, said he was detained and tortured between May and November 2018 in the United Arab Emirates after he was arrested on false charges of espionage during a study trip.
In another complaint, lawyers for the Gulf Centre for Human Rights accuse the general of “acts of torture and barbarism” committed against government critic Ahmed Mansoor.
These complaints have not resulted in any formal proceedings against the general.
Anwar Gargash, a former UAE minister of state for foreign affairs who now advises the country’s president, described the general’s election as “a testament to our country’s achievements and efficiency in the fields of law enforcement and security”.
Gargash dismissed the accusations against Raisi as an “organised and intense smear and defamation campaign” which the election had now “crushed on the rock of truth”.

7,Eight killed in bombing near school in Somalia capital,Anguished parents rushed to the scene of the blast as injured students were taken to hospitals around the city.,"

MOGADISHU: Eight people were killed and a number of students were injured in a car bombing near a school in Somalia’s capital Mogadishu on Thursday, police said.
It was latest deadly attack claimed by Al Shabaab jihadists who have long been fighting against the fragile government in the troubled Horn of Africa country.
Anguished parents rushed to the scene of the blast, which wrecked the school building, as injured students were taken to hospitals around the city.
The explosion hit at around 7:30am, just as children were settling down for their first lessons, principal Yusuf Hussein Abdi said.
In seconds, wooden beams and tin sheets came crashing down on the young pupils, as some of the walls gave way.
“You can understand how it feels when many students, mostly children, came under attack as school rooms collapsed,” Abdi said, adding that seven students were injured.
People pulled victims out of the rubble, using their bare hands to carry them to safety until ambulances arrived.
Prime Minister Mohamed Hussein Roble condemned the attack, saying in a statement: “This ruthless act clearly indicates how far this twisted group went to shed the blood of innocent civilians indiscriminately.” Somalia police spokesman Abdifatah Adan said earlier that eight civilians were killed and 17 others wounded, without giving more details.
Security official Mohamed Abdillahi said the explosion was caused by a car bomb, but said the target of the attack was not known.
Witnesses said a large convoy carrying troops from AMISOM, the African Union force fighting the Al Qaeda-linked Al Shabaab group, was passing through the area when the bomb went off.
“I was close to the area when the blast occurred, there was an AMISOM convoy... passing by,” Said Ibrahim said.
Al Shabaab claimed responsibility for the bombing, saying it was aimed at “military trainers.” The militants frequently carry out attacks in the capital and elsewhere in the country against civilian, military and government targets.
“Everyone was shocked and the scene was really horrible,” said Naima Ali, whose daughter was among the lucky ones to escape the carnage unharmed. “I saw some of the students bleeding,” Ali said.
Mohamud Omar, whose cousin was at the school when the attack occurred, said the blast left a trail of devastation in its wake, with backpacks scattered under the debris.
“The blast destroyed the whole area and left the road in ruins, thanks to God that most of the students were unharmed despite the huge damage the explosion caused,” he said.
The founder of Mogadishu’s Aamin ambulance service, Abdulkadir Abdirahman Adan, shared photos of the rubble-strewn scene on Twitter, calling the bombing “a tragedy”.
The East African bloc IGAD (Intergovernmental Authority on Development) condemned what it described as a “heinous and reprehensible terrorist attack”.
On Saturday, a prominent Somali journalist was killed and a colleague seriously wounded in a suicide bombing claimed by Al Shabaab.
Abdiaziz Mohamud Guled, the director of government-owned Radio Mogadishu, was a fierce critic of the Islamists.
Al Shabaab, which has been waging a violent insurgency against the country’s fragile government since 2007, said its fighters had long pursued the journalist.
The militants also claimed two attacks in September that together killed 17 people. A car bombing on September 25 near the presidential palace killed eight people, including the prime minister’s adviser for women and human rights, Hibaq Abukar.
Eleven days earlier, nine people, most of them members of Somalia’s security forces, died in a blast near a Mogadishu checkpoint.
Al Shabaab controlled the capital until 2011 when it was pushed out by AMISOM troops, but it still holds territory in the countryside.

8,National Geographic ‘Afghan girl’ evacuated to Italy,Rome's government says it responded to pleas from non-profit organisations working in Afghanistan to help her leave the country.,"


 
ROME: Sharbat Gula, the green-eyed Afghan woman immortalised decades ago on a National Geographic cover, has been evacuated to Italy, the Italian government said on Thursday.
“Afghan citizen Sharbat Gula has arrived in Rome,” it said in a statement, without giving a specific date.
Rome said it had responded to pleas from non-profit organisations working in Afghanistan to help her leave the Taliban-controlled country, “organising for her to travel to Italy as part of the wider evacuation programme in place for Afghan citizens and the government’s plan for their reception and integration”.
Gula became arguably Afghanistan’s most famous refugee after US photographer Steve McCurry captured her portrait in a Pakistan camp in the 1980s and it was published on the front cover of the National Geographic magazine. Gula said she first arrived in Pakistan an orphan, some four or five years after the Soviet invasion of 1979, one of millions of Afghans who have sought refuge over the border since.
She was deported back to Afghanistan in 2016 after she was arrested for living in Pakistan on fraudulent identity papers.
In early September, Rome said it had evacuated almost 5,000 Afghans from Afghanistan after the Taliban seized power in August.
Italy earlier this month said it had granted citizenship to Afghanistan’s first woman chief prosecutor, Maria Bashir, after she had landed in the European country on September 9.
Italy was one of five countries most involved with Nato’s US-led mission in Afghanistan along with Germany, Britain and Turkey.

9,"France, UK trade blame after 27 die in migrant tragedy","The Channel is one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, where currents are strong, water is cold, dinghies are often overloaded.","CALAIS: France and Britain traded blame on Thursday after 27 people died trying to cross the Channel in an inflatable dinghy, the worst accident of its kind on record in the waterway separating the two countries.
With relations fraught by years of tension over Brexit and immigration, much of the focus was on who should bear responsibility, even if both sides vowed to work together to find joint solutions.
“There is bad immigration management (in Britain),” French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told RTL radio, while calling on other European countries, which migrants cross on their way to French shores and then Britain, to do more to help.
“It’s an international problem,” Darmanin said. “We tell our Belgian, German and British friends they should help us fight traffickers who work at an international level.” One smuggler arrested overnight had bought dinghies in Germany, he said.
His British counterpart Priti Patel said she would be having talks with Darmanin, hours after Prime Minister Boris Johnson put the blame on France, saying: “We have had difficulty persuading some of our partners, particularly the French, to do things in a way that we think the situation deserves.”
Meanwhile, rescue volunteers and rights groups said the catastrophic drowning was to be expected as smugglers and migrants take more risks to avoid a growing police presence.
“To accuse only the smugglers is to hide the responsibility of the French and British authorities,” the Auberge de Migrants NGO said.
It and other NGOs pointed to a lack of legal migration routes and heightened security at the Eurotunnel undersea rail link, which has pushed migrants to try to make the perilous sea crossing.
The Channel is one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, where currents are strong, the water is cold and dinghies are often overloaded.
“This is a tragedy that we dreaded, that was expected, we had sounded the alarm,” said Bernard Barron, head of the Calais region SNSM, a volunteer group which rescues people at sea.
“The smugglers are more and more reckless, criminal, launching at sea poor innocent people who want to reach England at all costs without knowing the sea.”
On Thursday authorities announced that a total of five suspected people-smugglers had been arrested in connection with the disaster.
Britain has repeated an offer to have joint British-French patrols off the French coast near Calais, from where Britain can be seen on a clear day and where most migrants take to the water.
Paris has previously resisted such calls and it is unclear if it will change its mind five months before a presidential election in which migration and security are key topics. London has in the past threatened to cut financial support for France’s border policing if it fails to stem the flow.
“We’re prepared to offer support on the ground we’re prepared to offer resources,” Britain’s Immigration Minister Kevin Foster told BBC TV.
“We’re prepared to offer, literally, people to go there and help and assist the French authorities.”
“We’re clear: we don’t just see this as an issue that France needs to deal with, but one that we want to work together with France and our wider European partners... to break the business model of these gangs,” Foster said.
Regaining control of Britain’s borders was a totem for Brexit campaigners ahead of the 2016 referendum on EU membership.
Before Wednesday’s disaster, 14 people had drowned this year trying to make it to Britain, a local maritime prefecture official said. In 2020, seven people died and two disappeared, while in 2019 four died.

LUXOR: Egypt unveiled on Thursday a road lined with hundreds of ram-headed sphinx statues dating back more than 3,000 years, in a grandiose night-time ceremony at Karnak Temple in archaeologically-rich Luxor.
Dubbed the “Rams Road”, the sandstone-paved path connecting the temples of Karnak and Luxor in the centre of the southern Nile city was officially opened by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and a host of senior officials in a spectacular night-time ceremony.
The road is nearly three kilometres (two miles) long and named “The Path of God” in ancient Egyptian mythology.
It is flanked on both sides by statues that were buried for centuries under desert sands before they were revived and restored for display by the country’s Egyptologists in recent years. The ram is an embodiment of the ancient Egyptian deity Amun.
Karnak Temple was built around 2,000 to 4,000 years ago and is dedicated to Amun-Ra, an ancient Sun god. It covers an area of over 100 hectares (250 acres).
Luxor Temple was constructed some 3,400 years ago by Amenhotep III and has been used as a site of continuous religious worship from the ancient Egyptians to Christian Copts and later Muslims.
Egypt’s tourism and antiquities ministry has vowed to make the Arab world’s most populous country a vaunted destination for tourists by boosting its reputation as “an open air museum”.
The tourism sector in Egypt employs two million people and generates more than 10 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.
But it has taken a hit in recent years from political turbulence following the 2011 revolution, multiple terror attacks, and more recently the coronavirus pandemic.
In April, a procession of floats carried the mummified remains of 22 pharaohs through Cairo’s streets in a parade complete with a 21-cannon salute to the newly opened National Museum of Egyptian Civilisation.
In the coming months, the country is due to inaugurate another new showcase, the Grand Egyptian Museum, near the Giza pyramids in Cairo.
