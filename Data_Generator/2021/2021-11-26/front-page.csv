0,Trade deficit compelled govt to approach IMF: PM Imran,"Says overseas Pakistanis should be treated as VIPs, because incentivising and facilitating them will benefit the country.","ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Thursday said that the country’s trade deficit was the basic compulsion for the government to go to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
“Although our exports are increasing, they are still less than our imports. This causes pressure on our rupee, devaluation of our currency and inflation,” the prime minister said while addressing the launching ceremony of Sohni Dharti Remittance Programme (SDRP), aimed at encouraging the use of formal channels for remittances.
Though Pakistan would be making highest exports this year, other matching economies till the 1960s like Singapore (now around $200 billion) and Malaysia (around $300bn) were far ahead of the country in terms of annual exports, he noted.
The prime minister said Pakistan had so far gone to the IMF to seek financial support for 20 times.

Programme launched to encourage use of formal channels for remittances

Mr Khan said with Pakistan’s economy growing and imports increasing, there was pressure on the current account. “When pressure comes on the current account, it also puts pressure on the rupee and we have to approach the IMF,” he added.
Mr Khan termed nine million overseas Pakistanis the country’s asset and urged his economic team to focus on incentivising and facilitating them for sending remittances and investing in the country through banking channels for a win-win situation.
He said the overseas Pakistanis should be treated as VIPs, because incentivising and facilitating them would benefit the country.
The Sohni Dharti Remittance Programme is a point-based loyalty programme under which remitters and their beneficiaries will accumulate reward points by sending remittances through formal channels (State Bank-regulated entities) and will redeem those points at participating public sector entities (PSEs) by availing their services free of cost.
A mobile app, in English and Urdu, for iOS (Apple) and Android (Google) is available for remitters to download for registration and later on for point redemption at the PSEs.
A remitter can add one beneficiary relative and can transfer reward points to him/her for utilisation. A centralised back-end system is developed and run by 1-LINK.
The prime minister said the government would launch another programme under which the overseas Pakistanis would be able to purchase houses and invest in real estate in their homeland through Roshan Digital Accounts (RDAs) in a safe and transparent manner.
He said the banks would check and verify legal details of housing society so that the overseas Pakistanis could be protected from any fraud.
The prime minister directed the planning division to offer tax incentives to the overseas Pakistanis on their investment in real estate.
A per the criteria under Sohni Dharti Remittance Programme, Green category remitter will be awarded one per cent of up to $10,000 annual remittance, 1.25pc for Gold category sending from $10,001 to $30,000 and 1.5pc for Platinum category sending annual remittance of over $30,000.
The Public Sector Entities would offer special services for the entitled remitters, including on intentional air tickets of PIA, payment for extra luggage, mobile phone duty payment, purchase of vehicles, duty on imported vehicles, renewal of CNIC/NICOP, insurance premium, OPF school’s fee and purchases from Utility Store.
Further, the option of cash redemption is also being worked out.
Prime Minister Khan said Pakistan, which was ahead of countries like Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia in exports in 1960s, was now lagging behind due to past neglect and facing the issues of trade and current account deficits.
However, he noted with satisfaction that with growth in large scale manufacturing sector during the Covid-19 pandemic remaining on positive trajectory, enhanced remittances from overseas Pakistanis had helped bridge the gap in current account.
He said with efforts afoot to enhance foreign direct investment as well, the remittances by overseas Pakistan had been a big support in the difficult time.
Governor of State Bank Reza Baqir said after the success of RDAs, the launching of SDRP application by the central bank would help the common or less educated overseas Pakistanis to send their remittances by registering on the SDRP application, which required minimum information, including the details of their identity cards and passports.
He said the State Bank under the vision of Prime Minister Khan had also launched a loan scheme for buying 5 and 10 Marla Houses. While applications seeking loans of Rs236 billion had been received so far, Rs90bn loan had been approved and Rs25bn disbursed, he added.
PM meets GB CM
Later, the prime minister met Chief Minister of Gilgit Baltistan Khalid Khurshid and discussed matters relating to ongoing development projects in the region.
The prime minister was informed that work was at full pace to provide facilities of international standard at the tourist points in Gilgit Baltistan.
The meeting also discussed the issues pertaining to displacement of people due to construction of Diamer- Bhasha dam and the power policy.
Wapda Chairman retired Lt-Gen Muzammil Hussain also called on the prime minister and apprised him about the progress of wok on major dams.
Meanwhile, terming the talent of Pakistani youth unparalleled, Prime Minister Khan said the international companies were welcome to establish their ventures in the country.
He expressed these views in a meeting with Kaan Terzioglu, Group CEO of Veon, a multinational telecommunication services company, the PM Office said.
The prime minister said the youth of Pakistan could greatly benefit from leading international IT and telecom companies. He emphasised technology transfer and the training of youth.

1,Strike ends as govt agrees to raise petrol dealers’ margin,Over 80pc pumps in all major cities remained closed causing hardship to people,"ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: After a daylong successful show of power, the Pakistan Petroleum Dealers Association (PPDA) on Thursday night called off its nationwide strike when the government agreed to increase their profit margin by 99 paisa per litre.
A spokesman for the association Jahanzaib Malik confirmed to Dawn that the government and PPDA chairman Abdul Sami Khan had reached an agreement after holding day-long negotiations in Islamabad.
Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance Shaukat Tarin and Energy Secretary Arshad Mahmood held talks with the representatives of the PPDA as more than 80 per cent of the petrol pumps in all major cities, including the four provincial capitals, remained closed, causing great inconvenience to the general public.
Mr Malik said they were charging Rs3.91 per litre earlier and now their commission would be Rs4.90 and it would be increased after the government’s announcement of new prices next month. He said the dealers were demanding a 6pc increase in the selling price of petroleum products and the government had agreed to take it up to 4.4pc.

Over 80pc pumps in all major cities remained closed causing hardship to people

Later, the Petroleum Division of the Ministry of Energy issued a handout stating that “all stakeholders appreciated the Petroleum Division’s proposal for enhancement of 99 paisa in the existing margin of petrol i.e. Rs3.91/litre and 83 paisa in the existing margin of high speed diesel i.e. Rs3.30/litre”.
“The proposal for 25pc increase in the margin of dealers will cover all delays in the revision of margin in the past and would also help dealers in mitigating the impact of inflation,” it said, adding the Petroleum Division had assured that it would put all its endeavours to defend the proposal of 25pc increase in the existing margin before the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) and the federal cabinet “so that this historic relief to the petroleum dealers in the shape of sizeable enhancement in their margins becomes a reality”.
It said all the parties clearly understood that passing on the extra costs to the general public and consumers of petroleum products was not viable. “However, the Petroleum Division assured the dealers’ association that after six months (during June 2022) margins will be readjusted according to the level of inflation prevalent at the time,” it added.
The dealers’ association suggested that in the subsequent adjustment, the margins might be fixed in percentage terms and the Petroleum Division would put its best efforts to obtain approval from the competent forum for revision of dealers’ margin up to 4.4pc of the selling price, excluding dealers’ margin.
“While agreeing with the proposal of dealers’ association in principle, the division will make best efforts to get it approved through the competent forum. This arrangement of enhancing margin presently by 25pc and subsequent readjustment after six months will ensure safety and security of the business of the dealers without passing the extra burden to the general public,” said the handout.
Earlier in the day, most of the petrol pumps remained closed on the strike call of the petroleum dealers. Despite the fact that the PPDA had given the call for the strike almost a week ago, the government came into action and began talks with the representatives of the dealers only after the PPDA started implementation of its announcement regarding closure of petrol pumps from Thursday morning.
There were reports that more than 80pc of the petrol pumps in major cities remained closed by Thursday night and long queues of vehicles were seen at few petrol stations which remained open in major cities.
Some of the companies, including Pakistan State Oil, Shell and Hascol, had announced that all their company-owned petrol stations would remain in operation, but most of the petrol pumps of these companies were also found closed by the evening as many of them ran out of stock due to unusual rush of vehicles.
The PPDA had announced continuing the strike till the acceptance of their demand after Minister for Energy Hammad Azhar declared that the government could not increase the prices of petroleum products “to facilitate a few groups, who wanted to get the rates raised by Rs9 per litre in the guise of strike”. He had made it clear that the government would not bow before these groups, saying only justified demands would be accepted.
The opposition parties lashed out at the government over its handling of the whole issue as Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) president and Opposition Leader Shehbaz Sharif said the poor Pakistanis were getting closer to death because of this government “while Imran Niazi’s cruelty and apathy were rubbing salt into the wounds of these impoverished people”.
“Every single crisis in the country from flour to sugar to petrol and gas is a product of Imran’s corruption, incompetence and mismanagement.”
Pakistan Peoples Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari in his statement stated that the entire nation was forced, time and again, to bear the brunt of the “selected government’s incompetence”. He said the PTI government through its incompetence had always turned every solvable issue into a painful crisis.

2,Intelligence Bureau accused of avoiding housing society graft probe,The Supreme Court had directed FIA to probe alleged corruption and malpractices of housing societies in 2019.,"ISLAMABAD: The Fede­r­al Investigation Agency has accused Intelligence Bureau’s senior officials of defying the Supreme Court’s order by avoiding a probe into the alleged large-scale financial bungling in the affairs of their housing society.
An FIA report submitted to the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in response to the petition of the Intel­ligence Bureau Employees Cooperative Housing Society (IBECHS) against an ongoing investigation of the FIA into the alleged tax evasion, illegal extension and commercialisation of the housing society contended that the probe against the society had been initiated in compliance with the apex court’s directions.
The Supreme Court had on Jan 15, 2019 directed the FIA to probe into the alleged corruption and malpractices of housing societies.
The IBECHS management committee comprising senior officers of the intelligence agency challenged the FIA’s investigation, contending that since a probe into its financial affairs had already been concluded, the matter could not be reinvestigated.
However, the FIA report stated that the case was never closed as a joint investigation team (JIT) that probed the housing society recommended site inspection of phases I and II of the society. Subsequently, the investigation agency sought records from the housing society as well as the Capital Development Authority (CDA).
“The petitioner society/IBECHS has not provided the same and instead filed the instant petition in this Hon’ble Court. FIA’s Inquiry unlawfully being dragged on…and cannot be concluded unless and until the accused society provides the requisite record, join inquiry/investigation,” the FIA report stated.
It pointed out that “in view of large scale loot and plunder of the housing/cooperative housing societies, the apex court… directed the FIA to constitute a Joint Investigation Team comprising senior directors of FIA, National Accountability Bureau (NAB), Anti Corruption Establishment (ACE) of the provinces and district collectors for conducting forensic audit”.
The IBECHS, it stated, “instead of joining inquiry/investigation… hesitant to present justifications of alleged large scale financial bungling of its management/employees who are the public servants”. The FIA requested the court to dismiss the society’s petition.
Last year, the FIA’s report on the forensic audit of housing societies furnished before the Supreme Court in a suo motu case stated that 38 out of a total of 66 in the federal capital have been recommended for further inquiry; 16 of 98 in Punjab Zone-I have been recommended for probes; nine out of 42 in Punjab Zone-II are on the red line; 164 out of 282 in Sindh Zone-I and 41 out of 117 in the Sindh Zone-II are in the grey list; one out of 36 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa requires a probe and 10 out of 26 in Balochistan need investigations.

3,Centre mulls uniform wheat support price for all provinces,Food minister says Sindh government’s decision has created distortion and is tantamount to hoarding and profiteering.,"ISLAMABAD: As the row between the federal and Sindh governments over fixing of minimum support price of wheat for the current Rabi season escalates, Minister for National Food Security and Research Syed Fakhar Imam has announced that the government is considering finding a constitutional way to set a uniform price for all the provinces.
The constitutional solution would prevent the provinces from fixing the support price different from that of the federal government, Mr Imam said at a press conference with Industries and Production Minister Khusro Bakhtyar here on Thursday.
While the Centre has fixed the wheat support price at Rs1,950 per 40kg, Sindh set it at Rs2,200.
The food minister termed the provincial government’s decision “non-serious” and “anti-people”. He said that before announcing the minimum wheat support price for 2021-22, the federal government had asked the Sindh government to submit its proposal, but the latter did not pay any heed to the former’s request and announced the support price which was higher than that of the federal government.
He said the Sindh government’s decision had created a distortion and was tantamount to hoarding and profiteering.
Defending the federal government’s decision, Fakhar Imam said the wheat support price at Rs1,950 would help maintain a balance between the purchasing power of consumers and input cost of farmers.
He said the support price announced by the Sindh government last year had increased the rate of wheat flour in the province, and it was much higher than in Punjab. He said the people of Sindh were suffering and compelled to purchase unjustified costly wheat flour due to wrong policies of the provincial government.
The minister said this year the government imported much less quantity of wheat than the target which helped in saving precious foreign exchange of over $800 million. He said there was no shortage of wheat in the country and the government had sufficient stock of the commodity until the first week of June next year, a time when harvesting of new wheat crop would be in full swing in Punjab.
The government to date has 5.3 million tonnes of wheat in its stock and the import of 1.3m tons is on its way, taking the total stock to over 6.6m tonnes, he said, adding that the government is releasing 40,000 tonnes of wheat on a daily basis.
Khusro Bakhtyar criticised the Sindh government for taking decision on wheat support price not in harmony with the federal government and said the province had become a safe haven for hoarders and profiteers.
About the fertiliser situation, he alleged that a huge stock of urea fertiliser was transported to Sindh from the rest of the country for hoarding. In Punjab, he said, the government was carrying out crackdowns on the dealers involved in hoarding, but the Sindh government remained silent due to which hoarders were moving fertiliser stocks to Sindh.
Livestock census
Minister for National Food Security and Research Fakhar Imam has called for a fresh livestock census in the country to get accurate data for evolving an effective strategy for promotion of the livestock sector.
It may be mentioned that there is a glaring difference between the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), a federal entity, and the Punjab Livestock Department on the number of large animals in the province. The PBS claims it to be eight million, while the provincial department puts the figure at five million.
Speaking at a seminar organised by the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) on Thursday, the minister lamented that only seven to eight per cent of the milk produced in the country was being processed, while it lagged far behind in animal breeding also and called for long-, medium- and short-term strategies to improve the situation.
LCCI President Mian Nauman Kabir, senior vice president Mian Rehman Aziz Chan and vice president Haris Ateeq, Punjab Prosecution Minister Chaudhry Zaheer-ud-Din, former livestock minister Asif Saeed Manais and Livestock Secretary Naveed Haider Sherazi also addressed the seminar.

4,FIA official’s remarks on Nadra data raises alarm,"Nadra refutes his statement, denies its system has been hacked.","ISLAMABAD: A meeting of National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Information Technology on Thursday witnessed a curious discussion on security of vital data as an official of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) claimed that system of the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) had been hacked but changed his statement when pressed to elaborate upon his remarks.
The FIA official also told the committee’s members that many SIM cards had been issued illegally after manipulation of the Nadra data.
While discussing widespread use of illegal SIMs in the country, the committee’s members observed that containing the sale of such cards was a challenge.
The committee called for enhancing capacity building of relevant departments to ensure cybersecurity in the country.

Nadra refutes his statement, denies its system has been hacked

“We have discovered that Nadra’s data has been compromised, it has been hacked,” Tariq Pervez, additional director of FIA’s Cybercrime Wing, told the meeting chaired by Ali Khan Jadoon.
The FIA had seized around 13,000 illegal SIMs during a crackdown in Faisalabad, he said.
Mr Pervez said that 89,000 complaints had been received by his wing, but they did not have the sufficient number of staff to address the complaints reported on a daily basis. “The FIA’s cybercrime wing has only 162 investigation officers,” he added.
His statement stirred alarm among the committee members who put various questions to him regarding theft of Nadra data.
At this, the FIA’s additional director altered his statement, saying that Nadra data had not been hacked, but its biometric system had been compromised and used during the SIM verification process.
He also told the committee that whenever they traced a suspect involved in financial frauds, the suspect usually turned out to be an elderly man or a woman, whose data was being used by someone else.
However, Nadra refuted the claim of the FIA official. In a statement issued after the committee meeting, Nadra spokesman said that the public biometric data was completely safe and it had not been hacked.
“The FIA statement regarding hacking of biometric data is based on misunderstanding,” the spokesman said, adding that Nadra would seek clarification from the FIA over the “unnecessary statement and misrepresentation of the issue”.
Responding to concerns of the committee members, Pakistan Telecommuni­ca­tion Authority (PTA) chairman retired Maj Gen Amir Azeem Bajwa said that no mobile phone company had been given permission to sell SIMs on the door-to-door basis.
“There has been 600 per cent decrease in the sale of illegal SIMs during the past one year,” he said.
The PTA chairman clarified that culprits obtained thumbprints of unaware people, mostly elderly persons or uneducated women, for other purposes, such as receiving digital payments, and these biometric verifications were then used to issue SIMs.
He said that another illegal method was to copy thumbprints, but this system was being phased out and live fingerprint detection system was being introduced to eliminate the use of silicon thumbs.
He said: “Two mobile phone operators have been fined Rs100 million and Rs50m, respectively, for showing carelessness while issuing SIMs and more than 0.53m SIMs have been blocked after receiving complaints.”
The PTA chairman said that 175,000 illegally issued SIMs had been blocked since November 2020, 2,600 of them in October this year.
He informed the committee that complaints could be lodged against those involved in sending messages related to financial fraud at the PTA website.
The committee was briefed by IT Secretary Dr Sohail Rajpur on the social media rules and the National Cyber Security Policy, 2021.
Mr Jadoon of the PTI, the chairman of the committee, stressed that it was essential to keep national interest and national perspective into consideration while formulating laws.
The committee members mainly belonging to the PML-N and the PPP said that rules and regulations should be framed after consultation with public representatives. The chairman of the committee decided that a separate briefing would be held on social media rules.
Regarding the cybersecurity policy, the committee unanimously called for strong measures to secure data, especially those related to national security and individuals’ privacy.
MNA Monaza Hussain briefed the committee on salient features of the visit of a parliamentary delegation to Azerbaijan last month. She said that there was significant potential of IT products’ export to Azerbaijan.
The meeting was also attended by Javairia Zafar Aheer, Kanwal Shauzab, Nusrat Waheed, Ayesha Rajab Ali, Naz Baloch, Syed Mehmood Shah, Shameem Ara Panhwar, Mahesh Kumar Malani and Maiza Hameed.
