• Apartment scheme to be launched for overseas Pakistanis
ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) board on Thursday named the newly-constructed PWD interchange after nuclear scientist Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan.
It also approved a dumping site for the rural area of Islamabad and a new apartment scheme for overseas Pakistanis.
The CDA board was directed by the federal cabinet to name a permanent building/infrastructure or road after the nuclear scientist who passed away recently.
The board headed by CDA Chairman Amer Ali Ahmed met on Thursday to discuss various policy-related matters.
The meeting approved a five-acre dumping site in Taumar for the rural population which will be set up after completing the formalities.
A new apartment scheme - Overseas Enclave - will developed on 400 kanals near Park Enclave III. The board decided that flats and apartments will be constructed for overseas Pakistanis under the Roshan Digital Programme.
A board member said the forum also approved CDA’s request to get the construction of 10th Avenue done through a government organisation instead of private contractors.
Amongst the government contractors, Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) and National Logistics Cell (NLC) have already been engaged by the civic agency and are executing various construction projects.
On Wednesday, the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) approved the construction of 10th Avenue from IJP Road to Srinagar Highway at a total cost of Rs12.139 billion. This project will be executed in two phases to be completed in two years.
Meanwhile, the board approved to engage National Electronics Complex of Pakistan (NECOP) to replace conventional streetlights with light-emitting diode (LED) in the capital city.
The CDA through NECOP will retrofit the traditional sodium streetlights already installed in Islamabad to European standard LED lights.
The consultancy of three projects - two interchanges at Khayaban-i-Iqbal (E-11 and Shaheen Chowk) and EIA study for widening and improvement of Attaturk Avenue from Jinnah Avenue to Ayub Chowk - was also sanctioned.
The board member said the privatisation of Jinnah Convention Centre (JCC) also came under discussion as the meeting was attended by officials from the Ministry of Privatisation.
Sources said the CDA told the privatisation officials that the board had no objection to the privatisation of JCC and the decision of the federal cabinet was final.
The CDA had asked the Ministry of Privatisation to provide study reports regarding availability of water, electricity from a grid, a solid waste management plan, traffic impact study and report on sewage treatment plant (STP) for getting a revised allotment letter from CDA.
Privatisation Commission has been stating that transaction of JCC was put on hold after the CDA raised objections after issuing a no-objection certificate (NOC).
Earlier, through a letter a few weeks ago the CDA told the Ministry of Interior that the civic agency had never opposed the privatisation of JCC rather it had asked: “In case, no study was conducted [regarding above mentioned studies], the matter may be brought into the notice of the prime minister or the federal cabinet as deemed suitable for appropriate intervention in the matter.”
Sources said during the meeting it was discussed that Privatisation Commission should give assurance to the CDA board that no new issues as pointed out by CDA will emerge. However, sources said the civic agency made it clear that it had no issue with privatisation of JCC.
The CDA board in July had decided to get the study reports from Ministry of Privatisation before the latter got a revised allotment letter of the JCC from the CDA.
The board had suggested that the 3.4 acres originally allocated for parking may be reconsidered as an amenity area in order to avoid any legal complications. 
The CDA has been stating that privatisation of such a huge building will have impact on roads and other services.

4,IHC orders meeting of missing journalist Mudassar Mehmood’s family with govt officials,Petitioner says state could not satisfy him regarding status of his son who went missing over three years ago.,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Thursday directed the secretary interior to arrange a meeting of the legal heirs of missing journalist Mudassar Mehmood with highest state functionaries.
IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah issued the direction while hearing a petition filed by Rana Mehmood Ikram, father of the missing journalist.
The petitioner moved the court stating that the state could not satisfy him regarding the status of his son, Mudassar Mehmood, who went missing on August 19, 2018.
Despite filing a report, the concerned police station did not register a criminal case. In October 2018, the petitioner submitted a petition to the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances and pursuant to its proceedings a belated criminal case was registered.

Petitioner says state could not satisfy him regarding status of his son who went missing over three years ago

Justice Minallah observed: “The buck stops at the prime minister and members of the federal cabinet because collectively they constitute the federal government. It is an onerous duty of the latter to dispel apprehensions and doubts of the petitioner and other loved ones of Mudassar Mehmood regarding involvement of the state or its institutions in his status as a missing person.”
The court directed the secretary Ministry of Interior to arrange a meeting of the petitioner, mother, wife and the three year-old-son of Mudassar Mehmood with the federal cabinet, the prime minister and its members.
A joint investigation team was constituted but the petitioner asserted that its report was not provided to him.
The last hearing before the commission was held on April 9, 2021. The commission submitted a report stating that the “missing person has gone on his own.”
Justice Minallah noted that the phenomenon of ‘enforced disappearances’ had not been alien in Pakistan. It cannot be denied that deprivation of liberty of citizens by agents of the state or by persons or groups acting with the authorisation, support or acquiescence of the state has been acknowledged by public functionaries in several cases in the past.
He observed that “the phenomenon of ‘enforced disappearances’ definitely constitutes a grave crime against humanity.” 
The court noted that the attitude of the authorities while dealing with the case had raised questions in the minds of the loved ones of Mudassar Mehmood regarding the role of the state and its involvement in his disappearance.
“Prima facie, they have reason to believe that the State and its functionaries are involved in the alleged abduction. This may not be true but the way they have been dealt with has given the loved ones reasonable grounds to believe the involvement of the State and its functionaries in the alleged abduction of Mudassar Mehmood,” the court order stated.
“It was, and continuous to be a constitutional obligation of the State to satisfy Mudassar Mehmood’s parents, wife and his three-year-old child that its institutions and functionaries are not involved, directly or indirectly, in the alleged act of abduction,” it added.

Fines amounting to Rs200,000 were imposed on owners of the kilns. The drive has been launched to control smog in the area.
The crackdown was jointly launched by the local administration, environment protection department and National Highway and Motorway Police in the jurisdiction of tehsil Taxila. Smoke from the kilns is not only a threat to humans but is the cause of zero visibility on motorways and highways besides having a negative impact on the rabi crop.
Assistant Commissioner Shahzad Mehboob, who was leading the operation, told reporters that brick kiln owners were asked repeatedly to install zigzag technology because it was environment friendly as compared to bull trench technology. 
He said: “Kiln houses often use bull trench technology and emit excessive smoke direct into the air which causes environmental pollution as well as smog during winter”.
Smog has started to spread in the Potohar region while the next three months are crucial as fog has started to appear early in the morning.
Earlier, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in a bid to control pollution and smog sealed 27 stone crushing plants and first information reports (FIRs) were registered against the owners.

However, some filling stations of Pakistan State Oil (PSO) and Shell were open in the twin cities where long queues of vehicles could be seen.
Commissioner Rawalpindi Syed Gulzar Hussain Shah told Dawn that as per directives of the federal government all filling stations of PSO and Shell had been directed to keep their outlets open otherwise action would be taken against them.
He said teams had been formed to check filling stations closed despite directions from Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) and the Petroleum Division. He said directives had also been given to the district administration of Rawalpindi, Attock, Chakwal and Jhelum to keep all filling stations of PSO and Shell open.

Strike will continue till acceptance of our demands, says dealers’ association

According to a report presented to the commissioner, there are 81 PSO filling stations in the district of Rawalpindi and two of them were open on Thursday. Shell has 31 filling stations and four of them were functional while Punjab police own one petrol filling station that was open. Other companies have 129 filling stations but only eight of them were functional.
Despite efforts made by the district administration, majority of the petrol pumps remained closed.
When contacted, PPDA spokesman Noman Ali Butt said the strike was successful as majority of the filling stations from Karachi to Gilgit-Baltistan remained closed. 
“We would not call off the strike till our demands are met.” He said the margin of profit of the petroleum dealers should be increased to six per cent.
On the other hand, residents of Islamabad and Rawalpindi had to spend their time in search of petrol. Some people were also seen filling petrol in plastic bottles from the filling stations. There are illegal shops in Dhoke Hassu and Dhoke Mangtal where people are selling loose petrol by charging Rs10 extra per litre.
“I came from Peshawar Road to get petrol in my motorcycle at the PSO petrol pump in front of Military Hospital on the Mall as all filling stations in my area are closed,” said Mohammad Munir.
Shahmir Hussain, a motorist, said he had to wait for an hour to get fuel in his car at the PSO filling station on Airport Road in front of the Civil Lines police station.
Meanwhile, cab drivers cashed in on the situation and increased the fares.

9,"PM’s aide, state minister got into brawl at UN moot, alleges PTI MNA",MNA Riaz Fatyana says representation of Pakistan in the conference was not up to the mark due to incompetence of officials.,"ISLAMABAD: A Member National Assembly (MNA) of the ruling PTI on Thursday created a controversy by claiming that Adviser to Prime Minister on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam and Minister for State Zartaj Gul got into a brawl while attending a UN conference on climate change in Glasgow.
He made the claim during a meeting of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC).
Mr Aslam later termed MNA Riaz Fatyana’s claim rubbish and in a video message said the lawmaker will face disciplinary proceeding by the party.

 



 
The PAC examined audit reports of the Ministry of Climate Change for the year 2019-20 under the chairmanship of Rana Tanveer Hussain.
Mr Fatyana said during the UN conference on climate change, Minister for State Zartaj Gul had a brawl with the prime minister’s adviser and she returned to Pakistan in the middle of the event.
He said the representation of Pakistan in the conference was not up to the mark due to incompetence of the officials of the ministry.
No Pakistani official received the delegates from Nepal and other countries in the camp, he added.
Later, Mr Aslam in his video message said Mr Fatyana’s disclosure was a pack of lies as no such incident had happened.
He said Ms Gul returned to Pakistan since she was supposed to attend the joint session of parliament.
According to him, Mr Fatyana was spreading disinformation because he came to attend the same conference with an NGO and demanded official protocol from the officials of the ministry. He alleged that that Mr Fatyana harassed the officials after they declined to give him a car which was meant for official delegation only.
Meanwhile, the PAC chairman directed the audit authorities to address the low-cost audit objections of the ministry at the Departmental Accounts Committee (DAC) level.
The committee examined the highlighted audit paras in order of highest amount involved therein and paras recommended for settlement by the DAC.
The meeting reviewed the audit objections of the Ministry of Climate Change.
Ministry of Climate Change Secretary Sikandar Baloch said he had recently taken charge of the ministry, adding he will conduct regular DACs.
The chairman of the committee said that there was no problem in dealing with the audit objections which were agreed upon by the DAC, consisting of the ministry and the audit authorities.

During a press briefing, they urged the government not to fall for the deceptive tactics and increase the taxation on tobacco products to safeguard Pakistani youth from its harms.
Briefing was organised by Society for Protection of Rights of the Child (SPARC) and its partner organisations Pakistan National Heart Association (PANAH) and Chromatic Trust.
Chief Executive Officer Chromatic Trust Shariq Mehmood Khan told the mediapersons that whenever talk starts for increasing taxation, according to the recommendation of World Health Organisation, the tobacco industry starts misleading people about illicit trade. The industry overstates the percentage of illicit trade and blatantly hides its practices of underreporting, he alleged.
He further added that last year there was a talk of increase in tobacco taxation but the industry launched a digital media campaign to mislead the people. 
Renowned celebrities were misled in producing ‘one sided, half true’ video messages which mislead the masses.
Public health consultant and tobacco control expert Dr Ziauddin Islam said that countering tobacco industry’s disinformation campaign is need of the hour.
