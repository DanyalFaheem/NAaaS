0,Struggling BD look to make amends in Pakistan Tests,Captain Mominul Haque says the young players in the team are motivated enough to fill the seniors’ shoes.,"CHITTAGONG: Bang­ladesh are putting on a brave face ahead of the two-Test series against Pakistan starting on Friday in the absence of senior players such as ace all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan and after recent Twenty20 failures.
Shakib has failed to recover in time from the hamstring injured during the T20 World Cup. Opener Tamim Iqbal has opted out of the series due to injury, and Mahmudullah, who hit 150 not out in Bangladesh’s last Test against Zimbabwe, has retired from this format.
Captain Mominul Haque said the young players in the team are motivated enough to fill the seniors’ shoes.
“We have to play with whatever resources we have,” Mominul said.  “There’s no point of thinking who is in the team and who is not. These seniors had a lot of contributions for Bangladesh cricket. But life goes on.”
In the T20 series which finished on Monday, Bangladesh were swept by Pakistan 3-0, extending their losing streak in T20s to eight matches.
Mominul insisted they won’t carry over the baggage from their dismal T20 record.
“I don’t think that [T20 record] will have a negative impact as the format is completely different. In Test cricket, you have to be consistent,” he said with a straight face.
But Bangladesh’s Test record this year also is unconvincing. They lost two home Tests against the West Indies from favourable positions. A two-Test series in Sri Lanka was lost 1-0, then they beat Zimbabwe by 220 runs.
“In Test cricket, the momentum could shift in just one session,” Mominul said.  “If you win 12 sessions in four days but then loss three sessions on the last day, you could end up losing the match.
“So what I want to say is we have to be very consistent throughout the five days. We have a plan which we will try to stick to. Whatever happened before this Test is in the past and we are now focused on playing good cricket.”
The skipper urged his team-mates to ignore criticism and concentrate on the job at hand.
“This is not the first time Bangladesh have gone through such a  phase. We have overcome such times before too,” he said.
“People got mentally  weak... because they pay attention to what is being said. My job is to  bring back focus. You cannot stop anyone from talking. So it’s better to  keep your ears closed.”
By comparison, Pakistan start the Test series in high spirits and confidence. Pakistan won the series against South Africa and Zimbabwe at home before drawing with the West Indies, which was their first series in the new World Test Championship cycle.
Captain Babar Azam warned his side against complacency.
“The difference is that it is their [Bangladesh’s] home team and we cannot take them easily,” said Babar, who also said something similar before the T20 series.
“It’s true that they are a young team but they are playing in their home conditions. They can give us tough time and we need to be focused.”
He also emphasised switching into Test mode quickly, only four days after T20s.
“The Test matches are very important even though we have had little time [to prepare],” Babar said.  “Our Test cricketers are coming after the season so we have tried to utilise the days because the time is short.

1,European powers joined by Sporting in CL last 16,PARIS: The parade of European powers advancing to the Champions League knockout stage on Wednesday was disrupted by...,"PARIS: The parade of European powers advancing to the Champions League knockout stage on Wednesday was disrupted by Sporting Lisbon completing a stunning turnaround to join them.
Manchester City and Real Madrid are back in the round of 16 after beating teams they lost to in September. Paris Saint-Germain also go through despite their 2-1 loss at City after leading when Kylian Mbappe scored early in the second half.
Madrid’s 3-0 win at Sheriff avenging a 2-1 home defeat to the champion of Moldova two months ago included a goal for Karim Benzema on a day of legal trouble for the forward and ensured Inter Milan also advanced from Group D by beating Shakhtar Donetsk 2-0.
Three-time European champions Inter return to the round of 16 after a 10-year absence, though Sporting ended a 13-year wait by beating Borussia Dortmund 3-1. Pedro Goncalves scored twice.
Sporting seemed overmatched in September when routed at home by Ajax then beaten in Dortmund, but three straight wins lifted the surprise Portuguese title-winners to advance with a game to spare.
“Teams grow,” Sporting coach Rben Amorim said. “It’s great, good for the project, but we still have a lot to do.”
Ajax and Liverpool extended their dominating group-stage campaigns with fifth straight wins.
Ajax’s 2-1 win at Beikta came thanks to two goals from record-setting forward Sebastien Haller, who came on as a substitute. Haller has now scored in his first five career Champions League games and is the fastest player to get to nine goals in the competition.
Liverpool cruised to a 2-0 win over Porto and moved an astonishing 10 points clear of the Portuguese team in second place in Group B that promises a tense final round on Dec 7.
AC Milan are still in contention after finding an 87th-minute goal from a 30-year-old Champions League debutant to win 1-0 at Atletico Madrid. Junior Messias’s goal left both teams on four points with Milan next hosting Liverpool and last-place Atletico going to Porto.
Leipzig were missing American coach Jesse Marsch, who tested positive for Covid-19, yet overwhelmed Club Brugge 5-0 in Belgium in their battle to finish third in Group A behind Man City and PSG.
Third-place teams in Champions League groups earn a ticket to the second-tier Europa League knockout playoffs in February. Dortmund and Sheriff will be among them.
UEFA makes knockout draws in all three European club competitions on Dec 13.
Lionel Messi, Mbappe, Neymar. PSG coach Mauricio Pochettino was able to pick his superstar forward line to face Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City without a typical center forward or Kevin De Bruyne because of a Covid-19 infection.
City still had enough despite failing to turn first-half dominance into goals and falling behind to Mbappe’s goal in the 50th.
Raheem Sterling struck with a classic City tap-in goal in the 63rd and, after Neymar wasted a clear chance, Gabriel Jesus won it in the 77th with a scuffed shot that beat PSG goalkeeper Keylor Navas.
Pochettino eliminated City from the Champions League in the same stadium as Tottenham coach three seasons ago, and there is speculation he could be back in Manchester soon as United coach. Both Manchester teams have won their groups and will be seeded in the Round of 16 draw.
Inter Milan are heading to the Champions League knockout stage for the first time in 10 years.
AC Milan can still join their city rival by extending their first Champions League campaign in eight years.
Milan went to Atletico with only one point from four Group B games and would have been eliminated with a loss. “The late goal from on-loan Brazilian journeyman Junior Messias was the biggest success of my life,” he said.
Inter had an easier time at San Siro against Shakhtar, with veteran forward Edin Dzeko scoring twice in a six-minute spell midway through the second half.
The top scorers in the Champions League this season are three superstars, a newcomer and an uncapped striker.
Sebastien Haller, in his first season in the elite competition at age 27, joined Robert Lewandowski on nine by scoring both Ajax goals at Beikta.
The former Eintracht Frankfurt and West Ham forward is now the fastest ever to score nine goals at the start of his Champions League career. Haller has taken just five games, two fewer than Erling Haaland needed across two seasons for Salzburg and Borussia Dortmund.
Christopher Nkunku also scored twice on Wednesday and now has seven this season for Leipzig, one more than Cristiano Ronaldo’s tally for Manchester United and Mohamed Salah for Liverpool.
It’s been a breakout season at this level for Nkunku, who at age 24 has not been selected for the France national team.
Haller was born in France, like Nkuku, and played for the under-21s but later switched eligibility to represent Ivory Coast.
Salah now has 17 goals in all competitions this season after getting Liverpool’s second at Anfield against Porto.

2,No intention to apply for any post of national team: Misbah,Negates impression that Pakis­tan’s performance in the T20 World Cup was better if compared with his tenure as head coach.,"LAHORE: Former Pakistan head coach Misbah-ul-Haq on Thursday said he has no intention to apply for any position when the Pak­istan Cricket Board (PCB) in the near future seeks to fill the vacant posts of national team management.
“I have no intention to apply for any post [of the national team management] to be advertised soon as the current ad hoc set-up of the team management is going to be changed,” Misbah said during an interaction with media on the occasion of the annual match of Muslim Gymkhana here at the Bagh-i-Jinnah.
Misbah, 47, in a surprising decision quit as the national team’s head coach in September this year soon after returning home from Pakistan’s  tour to the West Indies, citing last 24 months in managing affairs under bio-secure bubble environment forced him to take this decision.
Bowling coach Waqar, though not for the same reason, also resigned at the same time.
However, it  was the widely speculated that both Misbah and Waqar resigned in the backdrop of  Ramiz  Raja coming as PCB chairman. These speculations gained momentum when Ramiz — instead of holding any meeting with Misbah and Waqar to ask them to review their decisions — on the day of  his election as PCB chief appointed former Australian opener Matthew Hayden and ex-South Africa pace bowler Vernon Philander  as batting and bowling consultants, respectively for the ICC T20 World Cup held in the UAE in October-November.
Interestingly, both Misbah and Waqar as experts featured in a private TV channel programme  during the World Cup. Misbah did not agree with a questioner that he escaped as head coach.
“I have already answered these questions; no one can escape after performing [his duty] for two years. It was a mutual decision of both sides  and everyone knows both sides’ understanding,” Misbah said while avoiding a detailed response.
To a query, Misbah negated the impression that Pakis­tan’s performance in the 2021 T20 World Cup was better if compared with his two-year tenure as head coach.
“It is a wrong impression,” he said. “We defeated South Africa in South Africa, our performance in England was not bad. Yes, good and bad matches are part of every tenure.”
He continued, “If anyone reckons Pakistan’s performance in the [2021] World Cup was better as Ramiz made some changes in the team, it is good for Pakistan cricket; it is everyone’s aim.”
Misbah said Pakistan played well in the T20 World Cup in the UAE but unfortunately lost the semi-final to Australia in a close fight.
“Credit for this good show goes to [interim head coach] Saqlain Mushtaq and captain Babar Azam as the team played with unity,” he remarked
Meanwhile, former Pakistan cricketers Kamran Akmal, Imran Farhat and Taufiq Umar were also present on the occasion to watch the annual match which is a regular event of Muslim Gymkhana, a decades old cricket centre of Lahore, which has produced players like Inzamam-ul-Haq, Taufiq and Ahmed Shehzad for Pakistan.

3,Aussie bowlers want Paine as wicket-keeper for Ashes: Lyon,"“Tim made a mistake, he’s owned it, for me that shows great courage, to be honest,"" says spin king Nathan Lyon.","BRISBANE: Australia’s bowlers want Tim Paine behind the stumps for the first Ashes Test against England because he is  “the best keeper in the world”, spin king Nathan Lyon said on Thursday.
Paine quit as Test captain in disgrace last week over a historical text message scandal, but is keen to keep playing.
Selectors must decide whether to cut him loose and start afresh or show loyalty amid a groundswell of support to keep him in the team for the opening clash in Brisbane on Dec 8.
Opener Marcus Harris on Wednesday said Paine had the backing of the Australian squad and Lyon — who is one wicket away from claiming 400 Test scalps — reiterated this.
“The selectors always said they were going to pick the best available XI and in my eyes Tim Paine is the best keeper in the world,” he said.
“I know I want him. Every bowler’s relationship with [him] is exceptional and Tim Paine is a very loveable guy and a very well-respected guy within the changeroom.”
Lyon added that he could  “100 percent guarantee he [Paine] has the full support of the Australian changeroom”.
“Tim made a mistake, he’s owned it, for me that shows great courage, to be honest.”
Paine quit ahead of a series of lewd text messages with a female colleague in 2017 being made public.
He was investigated at the time and cleared of any breach of cricket’s code of conduct, but said he was stepping down as skipper because his actions  “do not meet the standard of an Australian cricket captain”.
His replacement is yet to be announced with Pat Cummins and Steve Smith the frontrunners to lead the side.

4,"Iyer, Jadeja steer India to 258-4 in smoggy Kanpur",Iyer shared an unfinished 113-run partnership with all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja who made a busy 50 off 100 balls.,"KANPUR: Shreyas Iyer’s unbeaten 75 on debut steadied India after an afternoon wobble to end the opening day of the first Test looking comfortable at 258-4 here at the Green Park on Thursday.
Iyer shared an unfinished 113-run partnership with all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja who made a busy 50 off 100 balls, in the heavily polluted industrial city of Kanpur.
Pollution cast a hazy pall over the ground, with levels of the most  harmful PM2.5 microparticles reaching more than 19 times the World  Health Organisation’s recommended daily maximum, according to monitoring  company IQAir.
Iyer, the last specialist batsman in the order before bowling all-rounders and the wicket-keeper, hit 7 fours and two sixes in his 136-ball innings. His partner at the other end, Jadeja, hit six fours.
Iyer came in after Cheteshwar Pujara’s dismissal for 26 off 88 balls to Tim Southee left India at 106-3.
India’s stand-in captain Ajinkya Rahane built a 39-run partnership with Iyer before becoming Kyle Jamieson’s third scalp to leave India at 145-4 at tea.
Jamieson, the sharpest of the New Zealand bowlers, had earlier removed India’s new opening pair of Mayank Agarwal and Shubman Gill in his 15.2 overs spell giving away only 47 runs and taking three wickets.
“(I) hardly played the last couple of months. Was nice to find some rhythm.
Probably too good at times, hence the overstepping,” Jamieson said.
“Hopefully the new ball swings a bit in the morning and we can take a few wickets. India is probably a fraction ahead, but we did well to have them four down.”
Gill, who looked promising at unbeaten 52 off 93 balls going into lunch, could not add to the score and was bowled by Jamieson in the first over after the break.
He hit five fours and a six in his free-flowing innings and was Jamiseon’s second, after Agarwal who edged him to wicket-keeper Tom Blundell in the eighth over after a scratchy 13 runs off 28 balls.
New Zealand captain Kane Williamson re-introduced Tim Southee in the 38th over of the innings and the veteran removed a well-set Pujara off his fourth ball.
Williamson took the second new ball when it became available at the end of the 80th over but Jadeja and Iyer comfortably navigated the four overs before play was called off for bad light.
The hosts dominated the final session of the game and will now hope to bat the Kiwis out of the game on Friday before the pitch becomes more conducive to spinners.
India were without a rested Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli and an injured K.L. Rahul.
The World Test Championship holders picked two specialist spinners — Ajaz Patel and William Some­rville — and spinning all-rounder Rachin Ravindra for Kanpur.
Patel bowled his left-arm spin for 21 wicketless overs that cost 78 runs.
Off-spinner Somerville was introduced in the 18th over and bowled a tidy 24-over spell for 60 runs.
The 22-year-old Ravindra, the other debutant in the match, got to bowl for the first time in the 25th over with the ball already gripping and turning on the slow first-day pitch, but failed to take a wicket.
Rahane too packed his side with three specialist spinners in Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin and Axar Patel.

5,Five-star Embuldeniya helps Sri Lanka thrash West Indies,"Chasing a hefty target of 348, West Indies were bowled out for 160 before tea on the final day.","GALLE: Lasith Embuldeniya took five wickets in the final innings as hosts Sri Lanka thrashed the West Indies by 187 runs in the first Test here at the Galle International Stadium on Thursday to surge 1-0 up in the two-match series.
Chasing a hefty target of 348, West Indies were bowled out for 160 before tea on the final day, with Nkrumah Bonner the lone warrior with an unbeaten 68 on a turning wicket.
Bonner was one of only three West Indies batsmen to make it into double figures in their second innings, along with Joshua Da Silva, who made 54, and Rahkeem Cornwall who managed 13.
Sri Lanka secured a 156-run first-innings lead thanks to a masterful 147 by Dimuth Karunaratne and four wickets by Praveen Jayawickrama helping to scuttle the visitors for 230.
With rain washing out some play and storm clouds threatening, Karunaratne starred again in Sri Lanka’s second innings with 83, aided by Angelo Mathews who made 69, to set the West Indies a mountainous task to win.
“I was worried leading into the Test match,” Karunaratne said. “But something told me that if I get a good start, I will do well.
“It was a nervous start but I gained confidence the more I batted.”
On day four the hosts’ spin trio made quick work of the West Indies top order with a collapse seeing the tourists lose four wickets in 15 balls for just four runs.
Reeling on 52 for six at the start of the final day, the West Indies clung on with Bonner and Da Silva putting on 100, the West Indies’ highest partnership of the match.
Despite the wicket offering plenty of assistance, the two batsmen tackled the Sri Lankan spin threat well with clever use of footwork. Three chances were also put down by Sri Lanka with Pathum Nissanka the guilty party each time.
It was a crucial seventh-wicket partnership for the tourists after they had been reduced to 18 for six on day four.
At that point, the West Indies were in danger of being shot out for their lowest score in Test cricket with the game ending inside four days.
Their lowest total was 47 all out against England in Jamaica in 2004.
“The first innings total is always important. We did not do well and were under pressure from that point onwards,” said West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite.
“It is difficult to play catch-up in Test cricket... We need to have clarity on our batting. Not just big shots, but we have to defend confidently too.”
Sri Lanka dismissed Da Silva 15 minutes before lunch when he was caught at slip by Dhananjaya de Silva to give Embuldeniya his third wicket in the innings. Da Silva’s 54 came off 129 balls and contained five fours.
Bonner on 41 was given out leg before wicket to Ramesh Mendis, but the batsman successfully reviewed the decision. But the West Indies, chasing their first-ever Test win in Sri Lanka, collapsed after lunch.
Embuldeniya finished the innings with a five-wicket haul while Mendis complemented him well with four scalps.

As Quetta’s Baloch FC took on Muslim FC of Chaman in the final of the Ufone Balochistan Cup at a packed Ayub Football Stadium on a blustery Thursday evening, it’s pretty clear why the affinity to football in Balochistan is unparalleled to the rest of the country. 
Loyalties were fiercely split between the fans in attendance. The crowd was asked to keep their emotions in check. Muslim FC’s most popular player Hayatullah had to make an appeal to his club’s fans to not disrupt the game. After all, it was just a game. But for fans of the game here, it’s a part of faith.
Football tribalism is akin to the one in the society here by and large. Balochistan is a working-class society and football has historically been a working class game.
The seeds of the Quetta-Chaman rivalry have long been sown. It’s about bragging rights in the province. Regardless of what tournament it is, this is about supremacy. Then, there is a difference of ideals and beliefs too as well as how football found its way into different regions of Pakistan’s biggest province.
Quetta, which Pashtuns have for long claimed to be as part of its Southern frontier, most historians believe, got its taste for the game from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, formerly the North West Frontier Province, where British evangelist Theodore Leighton Pennell introduced the game in the 1880s.
Chaman’s proximity to Afghanistan, where football is wildly popular, is believed to have played its part in the propagation of the game in the border town. The Makran Coast was until the 1960s a territory of Oman. The mining towns of Dukki and Panjgur learned about the game thanks to the British miners who played the game during their leisure time.
It has meant Balochistan has been a breeding ground for some other country’s greatest players. From full-back Jumma Khan, who pre-partition was the province’s greatest export to Mohammedan Sporting Kolkata and was part of five Calcutta League-winning squads in six seasons, to Qayyum Changezi and Mohammad Essa, and Pakistan’s biggest star of the social media age, Kaleemullah.
But while the players have broken new ground, Balochistan’s top clubs haven’t. And it’s largely down to the fact that in a department-dominated national league, the Pakistan Premier Football League, they cannot match the spending or retention power to really make a mark. Most of their top talents — Essa and Kaleem, for example — get snapped up by departments which can offer regular salaries and benefits even during the off-season.
“For us, the PPFL is only a stage whereby the players we pick up from the community can express themselves and get picked up by the departments where they can have a better future,” Baloch FC Quetta manager Imran Ali told Dawn after the final.
This year, though, having won promotion back to the country’s top tier after a seven-year gap, Baloch FC — which has been in existence since the country’s independence — decided not to participate in the PPFL due to the long-running dispute in the Pakistan Football Federation.
Pakistan remains suspended by FIFA after the court-elected PFF led by Ashfaq Hussain Shah took back control of the PFF headquarters from the Normalisation Committee appointed by the global football body. It was the latest incident which has hampered the growth of the game in the country. And Balochistan, it can be said, has suffered the most.
“Players need a chance to play … especially the players here,” Kaleemullah told Dawn. “It is one of the reasons why Balochistan looks forward to tournaments organised by private companies.”
Lots of talent that has come over the years has only participated in tournaments like the one organised by Ufone, which was first organised in 2016 and is now in its fourth edition. In its first edition, it clashed with the Pakistan Petroleum Limited Balochistan Cup which was held for three years until 2017.
At least, these tournaments have shown more consistency than the PPFL. This season’s PPFL — held after a near three-year gap — was organised by Ashfaq Shah’s group, meaning it was always a disputed one. The edition before that was held four years ago, just before the battle over the control of the PFF began with a controversial election in 2015.
“It’s caused great damage to our players … there has been nothing to look forward to for the players,” former Balochistan Football Association secretary Haji Saeed Tikko, who is organising the tournament with Ufone, told Dawn. “We have a tournament here where we have participation from the whole province and we can see new talent but where do they go.”
At this tournament, Tikko organised talent hunts across every district in Quetta. Previously, this was done by the organisers of the PPL Cup and the Ufone Cup would only see clubs taking part. “The club teams have come out on top here because they have been in existence while the district teams had players who have never played together. Despite that, we’ve still seen promising talent in the districts.”
As Tikko spoke, his gaze turned to the FIFA Goal Project behind the Ayub Stadium. What could’ve left a lasting legacy, and a token of contribution from the global football body to the football-mad Balochistan stood in the darkness. It was supposed to be a training centre for emerging talent. Over the years, it has only changed ownership but hasn’t had any tenants — the players.
After the NC was appointed in September 2019, the group led by Haji Khalil, the rival group to Tikko’s which is led by Abdul Rauf Nautezai, was made the caretaker of the Goal Project. Member’s of Khalil’s group had been named on the provincial committee for Balochistan but change at the helm of the NC, and its subsequent restructuring, meant Nautezai and Tikko now have control. “The NC hasn’t done anything to revive it really,” Tikko rued.
In the shadow of the Goal Project, Muslim FC lifted the trophy amid fireworks into the night sky at the floodlit Ayub Stadium after winning the final 2-0. Muslim FC had participated in the PPFL season which came to an abrupt halt after the government sealed the PFF headquarters due to the non-payment of its lease for three years, throwing Ashfaq’s PFF out of office.
They were in fifth place after 14 matches played but realistically, in the face of the challenge from the departments, they weren’t title challengers. On their own turf, in their own province, though, they are the kings. And their fans made sure they celebrated every bit of it. 
The government has moved to start the closure of departmental sports by early next year and instead move to a regional system. There, however, seems to be no roadmap for how clubs like Muslim FC and Baloch FC will feature in it. For all their history, and the fan culture they bring, they need to be in the system. For now and with the PFF imbroglio stretching on, it seems they will have to participate in tournaments like these to prove they are the best team in a province where passion for football knows no bounds.

9,Senate body deplores pathetic condition of Pakistan hockey,ISLAMABAD: A Senate sub-committee on Inter-provincial Coordination (IPC) on Thursday expressed its ire over...,"ISLAMABAD: A Senate sub-committee on Inter-provincial Coordination (IPC) on Thursday expressed its ire over Pakistan’s pathetic performance in hockey, the country’s national game, during the last decade or so. 
The sub-committee meeting was held here at the Parliament House with Senator Irfan Siddiqui in the chair.  
Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) treasurer Mohammad Ikhlaq Usmani briefed the committee on the current state of affairs of the game in the country. 
The committee was informed that Pakistan last qualified for any major international hockey event back in 2012. There is no full time coach available for the national team while coaches are hired on part-time basis who only attend training camps just before the any event, the federation official regretted. 
The committee was told that the national team’s current world ranking is 17 and despite playing qualifying rounds during the last 10 years, they could not qualify for any top-level international event. 
The PHF official cited the lack of funds as one of the reasons behind Pakistan’s alarming slide in world rankings. 
Convener of the committee Senator Irfan lamented the role played by the PHF and the government in this regard.
“Hockey is our national sport, it used to be our pride. Such is the decline of sports in the country that we cannot even quality for big events let alone winning any. Past excuses will not be tolerated any further,” he said. 
Earlier, the committee discussed non response of sports federations, as the committee was told that out of total 41, only three federations submitted their reply in response to the questions asked by the committee.  
The sub-committee sought details of the working of all federal sports organisations, funds they received and their utilisation and  review their constitution under which these have been established.
Meanwhile, Pakistan Sports Board director general retired Col Asif Zaman informed the committee that there are 41 sports federations affiliated with PSB. All the federations were contacted and information was sought from them as per the prescribed format but only three federations submitted their response, he said.
The convener of the committee questioned why these federations are not responding to the IPC Ministry and the PSB.
“If the federations come directly under the regulatory control of the PSB and the Ministry then action should be taken against those federations that do not respond,” remarked Senator Irfan. 
Responding to this, Col Asif said, “We can cancel their affiliation.”
He further informed the committee that these federations will be held accountable and answerable once the new proposed sports policy is enforced. 
Senator Rana Maqbool Ahmed was of the view that there must be some provisions and rules in the current constitution to hold them accountable.
Senator Irfan directed the officials concerned to present a detailed report in the next meeting, clearly showing which sports federations were contacted and which of them responded and what action was taken against the ones which did not respond.
