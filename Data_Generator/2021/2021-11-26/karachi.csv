0,"Fog disrupts flights, road transport in Karachi city","Similar weather conditions will prevail the next two days after which weather is likely to become dry, clear for the next 10 days.","KARACHI: Heavy fog spread across the city on Thursday morning affected road traffic and also disrupted local and international flights because of poor visibility, which dropped to about 200 metres.  
According to the meteorological department, similar weather conditions will prevail in the next two days after which the weather is likely to become dry and clear for the next 10 days. 
It recorded 95pc and 42pc humidity in the morning and evening, respectively. The maximum temperature was recorded at 34 degrees Celsius and minimum at 18 degrees Celsius.  
“It’s not unusual and happens due to a sudden change in the wind direction. The wind generally moves from the land to the sea in winters. But, when it starts moving from the sea to land as happens in summers, its ability to hold moisture, influenced by other factors, reduces, allowing condensation and fog to occur,” explained Sardar Sarfaraz representing the Met department.  
Responding to a question as to whether in any way it is connected with air quality, he said people often tend to think about Karachi’s fog in terms of Punjab’s smog, though both were completely different phenomena.  
“If this form of weather persists for a longer period (as happens widely in Punjab), then one may link it with air quality. However, this is not the case here. Having said this, one must say that Karachi should have a reliable mechanism for measuring air quality across the city.”

1,SC wants allotment of 32 plots on parkland in Karachi cancelled,Directs NAB chief to take disciplinary action against the investigating officer in the case and compensate the affected people.,"KARACHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday sought a report from the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) chairman in a matter pertaining to illegal allotment of a park’s land, in the Al-Habib Cooperative Housing Society, KDA Scheme 33, to some private persons and directed him to look into the conduct of the investigating officer (IO) in the case.
A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Gulzar Ahmed also directed the NAB chief to take disciplinary action against the IO and also compensate the affected people after recovering their money from the accused persons.
It also observed that the IO, Ausaf Talpur, appeared unaware of the matter and could not answer numerous questions asked by the bench which were about basic information.
Justice Ijaz Ul Ahsan and Justice Qazi Mohammad Amin Ahmed are the other members of the bench.
The NAB prosecutor submitted that a reference had already been filed in an accountability court in Karachi against five accused persons. Three of them had obtained their pre-arrest bail, he added.
It noted that the IO claimed to have been handling around 100 other cases but he appeared to be not in much confidence. It directed the NAB chief to appoint proper IOs for such investigations or inquires.

Expeditious demolition of Nasla Tower also ordered

The bench observed that the case in question was 11 years old and the courts had also passed orders, but nothing had been achieved so far. It directed the registrar and administrator of the cooperative societies department to ensure that the allotment of all 32 plots carved out from the park’s land be canceled as soon as possible.
The CJP expressed his surprise over the fact that the IO was even unaware of the status of their bail and also made no efforts to arrest the accused. Apparently he was allowing them to approach the court for bail. Besides, the NAB authorities also made no efforts to file an application in the court for the cancellation of the bail, he observed.
A complaint was filed in the apex court in 2011 seeking action against over encroachment of the public park. The court was informed that the secretary, Athar Alam, along with other office-bearers of the society, allegedly encroached upon the park, converted its status to residential and sold them to the public while he and the co-accused also allegedly built warehouses on the amenity plot.
Revenue record
Hearing another case, the bench expressed its resentment over failure of senior member of Board of Revenue (BoR), Sindh, to comply with its orders to retrieve government lands, and directed him again to remove all encroachments and file a compliance report within one month.
The bench rejected a report field by the BoR member Shamsuddin Soomro as unsatisfactory, and observed that it had issued several orders from time to time for the removal of encroachments from the land meant for parks, playgrounds and other amenity purpose but his conduct appeared defiant.
The bench observed that there was nothing in the report except for constitution of a committee.
The bench deplored that more than 50pc of state lands had been encroached upon in Sindh but the BoR was doing nothing despite issuance of several court orders in this regard.
The CJP said that deputy commissioners were also doing nothing in this regard, and remarked that instead of implementing court orders, officials were extorting money and allowing new constructions on the state lands.
Justice Ashan asked Mr Soomro whether he was facing resistance or someone was preventing him from implementing the court orders.
Advocate general Salman Talibuddin requested the bench to grant some time to the senior BoR member for compliance.
The bench granted Mr Soomro one month’s time.
Healthcare facilities in Tharparkar
Taking up the matter of healthcare situation in Tharparkar, the bench came down hard on the provincial government for not making any efforts to implement its earlier orders regarding provision of health and other basic facilities to the people of this district.
The health secretary health assured the bench that he would take all relevant measures by establishing hospitals, dispensaries and other health facilities in different parts of Tharparkar and ensure provision of staff and modern equipment, including operating theatres.
The bench said that all posts of doctors and paramedics be filed immediately. It said transfer of severing medical officers and staff in Tharparakar to other districts should not be allowed until three years. It directed the health secretary to file compliance report within one month.
The bench was hearing a matter pertaining to the death of five infants at the Mithi Civil Hospital in 2017.
KE grid station
Hearing a petition regarding a K-Electric grid station built on a greenbelt in PECHS Block 6, the bench said that it would not allow the KE to run it, but could grant some time to move it to some other place.
The CJP noted that the land in question was meant for amenity purpose.
Hindu Gymkhana
The CJP, taking up the case of Hindu Gymkhana, expressed his disappointment over Karachi commissioner’s failure in filing a compliance report on its order to provide an alternative accommodation to the National Academy of Performing Arts (Napa).
He directed the advocate general to look into the matter and come up with suggestions/proposals from Sindh government in this regard.
A petition was filed by Shree Ratneshwar Mahadev Welfare in 2014 submitting in court that the gymkhana belonged to the Hindu community since before partition but government had taken it over as an evacuee property after the partition.
Nasla Tower demolition
Meanwhile, the bench in its written order directed the Karachi commissioner to expeditiously demolish the 15-storey Nasla Tower and submit compliance report in the next session.
The order was passed during a hearing of the case on Wednesday.
The bench found the commissioner’s report on the progress of demolition work altogether unsatisfactory.
Rejecting the report, the bench directed the commissioner to immediately start the demolition work and “achieve the total demolition thereof and clearance of malba as soon as possible”.
The order noted that on Oct 25, the commissioner was directed to complete demolition of the building within one week from Oct 27, but he had not complied with the orders and, rather, taken a stance to defy them.
“The court shall take action against the commissioner, Karachi for defiance of the court’s orders. The commissioner, Karachi shall ensure that compliance of the court’s orders is made,” it concluded.

2,"Warrants for arrest of Speaker Durrani, 10 others reissued",Defence counsel requests the judge to condone their clients from personal appearance till the next date.,"KARACHI: An accountability court on Thursday reissued warrants for the arrest of Sindh Assembly Speaker Agha Siraj Durrani and 10 co-accused in a National Accountability reference pertaining to his Rs1.61bn assets and alleged corruption.
The suspects had purportedly been absconding since revocation of their pre-arrest bail by the Sindh High Court on October 13. 
On Feb 20, 2020, Mr Durrani was arrested by NAB at an Islamabad hotel for investigation into his movable and immovable assets allegedly acquired beyond his known sources of income, making 352 illegal appointments and embezzlement of public funds in the construction of MPAs’ Hostel and the new Sindh Assembly building, as well as the appointment of project directors for these schemes.
Besides Mr Durrani, his spouse, children, brother and some associates have been nominated in the reference.
On Thursday, the mater came up before Accountability Court-III Judge Dr Sher Bano Karim, when three of the accused on bail appeared in the court.
However, Speaker Durrani and his 10 co-accused – Shakeel Ahmed Soomro, Mitha Khan, Tufail Ahmed Shah, Zulfiqar Ali Dahar, Munawwar Ali, Ghulam Murtaza, Gulbahar Lohar Baloch, Syed Muhammad Shah, Muhammad Irfan and Shamshad Khatoon – did  not turn up.
The defence counsel moved applications stating that since the SHC had recalled pre-arrest bail of Agha Siraj and the co-accused on Oct 13, all of them had subsequently approached Supreme Court to seek a bail before arrest. The counsel requested the judge to condone their clients from personal appearance till the next date.

3,"Federal govt created artificial gas shortage, PA told",KARACHI: Sindh Energy Minister Imtiaz Ahmed Shaikh on Thursday told the Sindh Assembly that the federal government...,"KARACHI: Sindh Energy Minister Imtiaz Ahmed Shaikh on Thursday told the Sindh Assembly that the federal government had created an artificial crisis of natural gas in the country rendering thousands of industrial workers and fuel stations without work. He pointed out that absence of gas had led to closure of industries and CNG stations.  
Responding to a call attention notice motion tabled by Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal’s Syed Abdur Rasheed, the minister vehemently criticised the federal government for its “failed” policies saying that people were even now unable to pay electricity bills due to hike in prices.  
The opposition MPA from Lyari had invited the attention of the home minister, portfolio of which is held by the chief minister, to an incident of firing on Lyari residents, who were protesting outside the K-Electric office against disconnection of power supply in their area.  
The MPA wanted to know what action had been taken by the provincial government against the culprits and the K-Electric.  
Abdur Rasheed said that the wounded included an 11-year-old boy who received two bullets in his legs, rendering him crippled for the rest of his life.  
He said another person received a bullet in his abdomen and was still struggling for life, while a passer-by was hit by a bullet in his hand.  
He said that several cameras were installed at the nearby shops and building near the place of the incident, but no one had been arrested so far, asking if police were only for protecting rulers.  
The MPA said that power supply was restored to Lyari after 72 hours i.e at around 12.30am on Thursday.  
Replying to his question, Imtiaz Shaikh on behalf of the home minister, said that the people in Lyari took to the street against suspension of electricity in the area on Nov 22 to hold a demonstration outside the nearby K-Electric office.  
He said that the security guard of the power utility resorted to aerial firing and in the meantime two unidentified motorcyclists opened fire on the demonstrators and sped away.  
The energy minister said that three people, identified as Meezan, Ghulam Farooq and Sohail were wounded in the incident and a case was registered against unknown attackers at the Baghdadi police station on the complaint of Meezan.  
He said that an investigation into the case was in progress, and assured MPA Rasheed that culprits would be brought to book.  
The minister said he took up the matter of power suspension to Lyari with the K-Electric which informed him that there were over Rs8 billion outstanding dues in Lyari and Rs1bn in Malir.  
The energy minister said that consumers were bound to pay the electricity bill, adding that people were unable to pay utility bills due to price hike.  
He said that the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s federal government had completely failed as people had been left nowhere due to ‘unprecedented’ inflation.  
Adjournment motion 
Meanwhile, the house admitted an adjournment motion of PPP’s Jam Shabbir Ali against approval of Census 2017 by the federal government.  
The assembly would debate on the adjournment motion on Monday. Separately, Deputy Speaker Rehana Leghari ruled out-of-order a privilege motion of MQM-P’s Muhammad Hussain against delay in presenting the auditor general of Pakistan’s reports before the provincial Assembly.

5,"National Media Fellowship on women, child rights launched",Sixteen-day activism against gender-based violence starts at the event...,"KARACHI: There was so much to take in at the launch ceremony of the National Media Fellowship on violence against women and child marriages organised by the Centre for Excellence in Journalism at IBA in collaboration with the National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Government of Pakistan, held at a local hotel here on Wednesday.  
The event, which also marked the start of 16 days of activism against gender-based violence and a 10-day National Media Fellowship, also included a spectacular art exhibition of paintings by women prisoners.  
The show of some 104 paintings had brilliant pieces of landscape, still life, portrait, abstract, calligraphy, etc. The inmates at the Women’s Prison in Karachi had been provided an excellent art teacher from Chawkandi Art Gallery by Barrister Haya Emaan Zahid, the chief executive officer (CEO) of the Legal Aid Society.  
Barrister Emaan also personally helped in opening their minds to creativity by sharing ideas with them as she herself paints as a hobby. The result was simply amazing. All the paintings were for sale with their proceeds to go to the prisoners themselves. They sold like hot cakes. 

Sixteen-day activism against gender-based violence starts at the event

About the need for training of journalists, the lead trainer of the workshop, Kamal Siddiqi, said it was needed badly “because time and again we get to see gender reporting, which is done in a very wrong way. The choice of words is insensitive and sensationalised. But saying that the media is reporting like this deliberately is not entirely true. Because there is a lack of training there as well,” he pointed out.  
“We want to train journalists in such a way that every trainee would go and spread what he or she has learned in his or her newsroom,” he added.  
Country Representative of the UNFPA, Dr Bakhtior Kadirov, said that any gender-based violence was a violation of human rights, which also impacted health and education. “There is a need to keep women and children safe from any kind of violence. And the media can help here in changing attitudes because it has the capacity to reach out to the masses,” he said. 
NCSW chairperson Nilofar Bakhtiar said that Nov 25 was marked as the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women. “Please treat us women as human beings. We want nothing more than human rights. End violence against women now,” she said.  
Finally, chief guest on the occasion, Sindh Governor Imran Ismail said women facing violence even in educated societies was a serious and concerning issue.  
Sharing the example of Laila Parveen, a political activist who along with her brother was manhandled at the Malir Court by lawyers recently, he wondered where the society was heading as even the courts were not safe for women? He also lamented the fact that women were also robbed off their inheritance by the male members of their families.  
He said he was also saddened about how girls who bagged 70 per cent of the top positions in academics there were then held back. “A girl who passes her exams in ‘A’ grade then marries someone with a ‘C’ grade as he expects her to sit home and waste her potential while he goes out to work. It’s a national loss and waste of manpower, which is also a kind of violence against women,” he said.  
CSW secretary Khalid Anwar Baloch, NCSW chairperson Sindh Nuzhat Shirin, Hum Network Ltd president Sultana Siddiqui and CEJ acting head Ayesha Azhar Shah also spoke on the occasion.

6,The framework of meaning,"KARACHI: When a person utters a phrase or sentence, more often than not, the addressee will understand it — unless...","KARACHI: When a person utters a phrase or sentence, more often than not, the addressee will understand it — unless it has words that the person who it’s addressed to is not familiar with. Sometimes metaphors and symbols are used to convey messages with multiple meanings. In art, just as in literature, once the artwork is done, it no longer remains in the hands of its creator to define in absolute terms what s/he had intended to convey through it. 
Art lovers are, or can be, at liberty to construe it the way they feel it right. An exhibition titled The Aftermath of Meaning by Ujala Khan featuring works in collaboration with M4HK is underway at the Full Circle Gallery. It, in a rather smart way, blurs the line between creativity and its effect that enables us to extract meaning out of it.    


Some of the artworks displayed at the exhibition. —White Star

 
But before one gets to the content side of things, a fleeting look at the kind of hard work and diligence that’s gone into the making of the large frames will suffice. They’re made using gold leaf, oxidized gold leaf, wire mesh, perforated steel, thread, meccano pieces, spray paints and resins with acrylic, enamel and mixed media on canvas. This is reason enough to give the nod of approval to the artists because the kind of detailing that can be seen in them is these days a pretty rare occurrence.   
Then comes the subject matter, which within the framework of the technical world that Khan has conjured, that ranges from questions related the metaphysical aspects of life to the efficacy of human relationships. One of them, ’Dia de los Muertos’ is particularly eye-catching not just because it’s crammed with plastic toys, scrabble pieces and googly eyes etc, but because it talks of both joy and mourning (since the title phrase translates as Day of the Dead in connection with a Mexican celebration) in a way that reminds one of a free verse poem that has an engaging rhythm carrying a difficult to handle topic. And this is where the importance of meaning comes to the fore which becomes more of a residue of diligent creative output than something that’s always there. What a fascinating way of making art!          
The exhibition concludes on Dec 3.

7,"IGP, CS told to arrange for proper chemical analysis in criminal cases",KARACHI: A model court directed the Sindh police chief and chief secretary (CS) on Wednesday “to take necessary...,"KARACHI: A model court directed the Sindh police chief and chief secretary (CS) on Wednesday “to take necessary measures to improve the operation, investigation and preparation of the chemical reports” in the criminal cases in which accused mostly go scot free due to benefit of doubts in those processes. 
Additional District and Sessions’ Judge Iqbal Ali Khoso of the Model Criminal Court (central) passed these directives while acquitting an accused Iqbal alias Hazoor Bux of the charges of possessing 10.200 kilograms of charas. 
The judge declared the case as doubtful due to faults in the investigation. 
He noted that the investigating officer of the case failed to take the samples of the alleged recovered contraband to the chemical laboratory for analysis while on the other hand the director of the Chemical Laboratory miserably failed to specify as to which slab of recovered contraband was tested as the case showed that only five such slabs whereas the property produced in the court showed some eight slabs in actual. 
“From the above discussion, I have come to the conclusion that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the guilt of the present accused,” the judge ruled. 
He acquitted the accused and directed the prison authorities to release him, forthwith, if his custody was not required in any other case. 
The judge also directed his office to send a copy of this judgment to the Sindh IGP and chief secretary to take necessary measures to implement the operation, investigation and preparation of the chemical reports, respectively. 
He also cautioned both the top provincial bureaucrat and police chief that the steps taken by the concerned quarters be communicated to the court accordingly within one month period to avoid further action. 
Earlier, the court had indicted the accused, but he had pleaded not guilty and opted to contest the case. 
During the trial the accused had denied the allegation and claimed innocence in his statement recorded under the Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). 
According to the prosecution, police Sub-Inspector Zulfiqar Qureshi arrested Iqbal alias Hazoor Bux on May 31 this year from the Sadiqabad graveyard in Sector 6-B of New Karachi, and claimed to have recovered five slabs of the charas in six bundles along with cash of Rs8,430. 
A case was registered under the Section 6 and 9 (C ) of the Control of Narcotic Substance Act, 1997 at the New Karachi Industrial Area police station on behalf of the state.

9,Implementation of laws on women’s rights urged,"KARACHI: Expressing concern over growing incidents of violence against women, speakers at a conference held at...","KARACHI: Expressing concern over growing incidents of violence against women, speakers at a conference held at Karachi University (KU) called upon the government to implement laws pertaining to women’s rights and devise a mechanism to provide support to the victims of violence and harassment. 
The one-day conference titled “Understanding Violence Against Women in Pakistan – Causes and Trends” held at the Arts and Social Sciences Auditorium on Thursday, jointly organised by the Centre of Excellence for Women’s Studies, UN Women and KU Office of Research, Innovation and Commercialisation. 
In her keynote speech, Dr Masuma Hasan, chairperson of the Pakistan Institute of International Affairs and president of the Aurat Foundation, presented a global overview of the situation, highlighting that violence against women had increased, particularly over the past two years during the Covid-19 pandemic. 
Femicide, she pointed out, was common around the world, particularly in some Latin American countries. India was described as the rape capital of the world whereas in Pakistan around 1,000 women were killed every year in the name of honour. The country also saw a significant number of child abuse cases annually, suicides of women and the brutal practice of throwing away newborns, particularly girls in garbage dumps. 
“Cybercrime against women is increasing at a faster pace nowadays which is brutally damaging the socio-economic condition of women in Pakistan. Though we have laws to protect women, they are not being implemented,” she said. 
Dr Hasan also referred to discriminatory and fundamentally flawed laws such as the Hudood Ordinance. 
UN Women Deputy Country Representative Jacqui Ketunuti through the video link shared that the trend of sexual harassment among women had alarming levels, which needed to be addressed in a timely manner. 
“The policymakers must work together to find effective solutions to the problem of violence against women. Civil society, the private sector and community representatives can be proven productive in ending violence against women,” she said. 
Presenting her research paper, Prof Zainab F. Zadeh from the United Kingdom cited the WHO data according to which 736 million to 852 million, or one in three women aged 15 years and above, experienced violence at least once in their lives.

12,Mithi court grants bail to suspects in Dodo Bheel murder case,Victim’s heirs inform court they have no objection to the bail and reached an out of court settlement on certain preconditions.,"MITHI: The additional sessions judge of Mithi on Thursday granted bail to all suspects, who faced charges of torturing a labourer Dodo Bheel to death on June 30, after the victim’s heirs informed the court they had no objection to the bail.
Aalim Bheel, brother of the victim and complainant in the murder case, his father Karno Bheel and Dodo’s widow Surya Bheel appeared in the court along with their lawyer advocate Wasand Thari and submitted the NOC, stating that they had no objection if the court granted the bail to the suspects. 
They told the court that they had decided to withdraw charges against the accused officials of the mining firm after reaching an out of court settlement with them on certain preconditions. The judge, after hearing the heirs and their lawyer, granted the bail on submission of surety bond worth Rs20,000 each. 
“We do not have enough money to hire lawyers to pursue the case and block the suspects’ attempt to get the bail” said Aalim.
He confirmed that he had earlier submitted the NOC to Sindh High Court in previous hearing in favour of the suspects, including Kashif Raza alias Commando, Qamar Abbas and others, who were directly or indirectly involved in the murder case.
He said that the family took the step after some notables of the area convinced them to settle the issue with the suspects and others in lieu of compensation of Rs10 million and offer of jobs to youths of their family in the mining company.  
“We, family members including my mother, Dodo’s widow and other relatives mulled over the offer for days before reaching a decision to pardon the suspects through proper channels,” he added. 
He admitted that before appearing in the court they had received Rs2 million and would get the remaining amount as per agreement after the suspects were exonerated of murder charges. 
He said that according to the settlement, seven of their youths would be given jobs in coal fields and the officials would bear expenses of education of the victim’s children. 
Karno Bheel, late Dodo’s father and his mother, also confirmed that they had agreed to pardon the suspects and said the accused officials had sent members of their families who entreated them to accept the settlement. 
Nandlal Malhi, information secretary of Pakistan Peoples Party Tharparkar chapter, said in a press statement that Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf leaders, including advocate Lajpat Soorani and his associates, had been pressing Dodo Bheel’s heirs to pardon the accused since the day the murder took place.
He said the criminal interference by PTI leaders greatly benefited the poor labourer’s killers who would easily get off the hook after paying some amount. PPP would strongly resist any move by the accused to resume job in any mining firm once they were exonerated of murder charges in the wake of the rapprochement, he said.

14,Premature to say anything about MBBS student’s suicide: Larkana police,"Students, civil society members take out processions outside Larkana Press Club, call for a transparent probe into the death.","LARKANA: Police on Thursday said that it would be premature to say anything about the death of Nosheen Bukhari, fourth year student of MBBS, who was found hanging from ceiling fan at her room in hostel at the Chandka Medical College a day before.
Larkana DIG Mazhar Nawaz Shaikh and SSP Imran Qureshi told journalists after inspecting the room of the deceased student at hostel-II that forensic report of the girl’s handwriting on her suicide note found in the room would make things clear if she had written the note herself or someone else had forced her to write it. 
“I met SMBBMU vice chancellor and interviewed administration personnel, security staff, class fellows, roommates [of the victim],” said the DIG. 
He said the forensic evidence of video, documents, mobile data and finger prints had been secured and they would help greatly in investigation. 
CMCH medico legal officer Dr Rukhsar Samo said in the preliminary post mortem report of the deceased that the death was caused by asphyxia which was sufficient to kill in ordinary course of nature. Samples of viscera had been taken for chemical examination and their reports would be released later, it said. 
Protest over girl’s death
Students and members of civil society took out processions and demonstrated outside Larkana Press Club on Thursday, calling for transparent probe into the death of MBBS student. 
The protesters’ leaders Imran Ali Marri, Imran Buriro, Awais Dahani and others condemned the college managers for hastily suspending classes and asking students to vacate hostels through a midnight notification. 
Electricity and water supply to the hostels had been suspended but they would not leave the hostels, they said. 
They said that it was third such incident in the college and appealed Chief Justice of Supreme Court and Sindh High Court to take its notice.
