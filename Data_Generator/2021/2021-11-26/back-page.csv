Some of these references have been filed against politicians.
“A total of 1,270 references, including the old ones worth Rs1,386 billion, are being reviewed afresh to see whether they are weak (having any deficiency in terms of evidence). We have to see whether witnesses appear in some references. There are some shortcomings. Besides, we will see whether 10- to 12-year-old appeals (filed by NAB) are on merit; if not, then they may be withdrawn,” NAB chairman retired Justice Javed Iqbal announced and added if he had the authority to decide the references they would not have taken years.
Mr Iqbal was speaking at a ceremony held to distribute cheques worth Rs338 million among the victims of Toyota Gujranwala Motors and Public Health Engineering Cooperative Housing Society scams at the NAB provincial headquarters here on Thursday.
The NAB chairman advised the bureau’s critics to go to courts if they believed it had instituted a false case against them. “The NAB has started a war (against) corruption and this will continue,” he declared.

Chairman says ‘storm in a teacup’ created about recoveries

In an apparent advice to the Imran Khan government over the state of Madina, he said: “If we have to realise the dream of Riasat-i-Madina then there is a need for self-accountability.”
In an indirect reference to the Sharif and Zardari families, the NAB’s chief said: “If billions of rupees were shown in the accounts of different vendors and money laundering worth billions has been committed then those allegedly involved in it are summoned.”
PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif, his son Hamza, and former president Asif Ali Zardari are facing money laundering accusations wherein the accounts of their benamis contained billions of rupees.
Responding to his critics in the opposition parties, Mr Iqbal clarified the bureau’s loyalties were not with the government. “NAB’s loyalties are only with the state; it is not pro-government,” he said and clarified that if someone had any evidence of NAB officials taking bribes they must come forward. “Bring me evidence of the involvement of any NAB official in taking bribes and I will initiate action within 48 hours,” he said.
Responding to criticism over Rs450bn supposed to be deposited by a property tycoon, Mr Iqbal said: “Questions are being asked where the Rs450bn deposited by a certain person has gone. I want to tell those who are raising a hue and cry that the amount has been deposited with the Supreme Court.”
In an apparent response to the Public Accounts Committee of the National Assembly that directed the NAB chairman to submit details of financial recoveries made by the bureau, Mr Iqbal said a “storm in a teacup” was created regarding the bureau’s recoveries.
“Major recoveries made by the NAB are not in the form of cash or currency, but land — houses/plots — recovered from the land mafia,” he said, adding that a complete audit of the NAB’s last three years had been carried out and no irregularity found.

1,Hazara elders pledge support for Taliban rulers,"A community leader says Afghanistan’s new rulers have put an end to war, stopped corruption and increased security.","KABUL: More than 1,000 Shia Hazaras pledged their support on Thursday to Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers, saying that the “dark period” of previous Western-backed governments had ended with the return of the Islamists.
Afghanistan’s Hazaras have been persecuted by Islamists for a long time, but on Thursday community elders gathered in Kabul alongside Taliban leaders in a show of support.
Senior Hazara leader and former lawmaker Jafar Mahdawi, who organised the gathering, said the previous government of president Ashraf Ghani was the “darkest point” in the history of Afghanistan.
“Afghanistan had no independence and (foreign) embassies ruled every aspect of the government,” he said. “Thank God, we have now passed this dark period.”

A community leader says Afghanistan’s new rulers have put an end to war, stopped corruption and increased security

Since the Taliban seized power in August, the new rulers have put an end to the war, stopped corruption and increased security, Mahdawi said.
But he called for a more inclusive government from the Taliban and urged the new rulers to reopen schools for girls.
“In the coming weeks or months we hope to witness an inclusive government that has representatives of all people,” Mahdawi said.
The current government, which the Taliban say is an interim one, is made up almost entirely of the group’s Pashtun stalwarts and does not include any woman.
Taliban leader and spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told the gathering that rebuilding the country was a priority.
“Our jihad against the foreign invaders has ended and now we will start jihad for building the country,” he said.
Senior Hazara cleric Ayatollah Waezzada Behsudi called for reconciliation between all the ethnic groups of the country.
“Let’s forgive each other... If the current government wants to be sustainable, it must have support from all the people,” he said.
The Hazaras, who make up 10 to 20 per cent of Afghanistan’s around 38 million population, have been persecuted for a long time in the Sunni majority country.
The Islamists have carried out several mass killings of Hazaras, including in the city of Mazar-i-Sharif in 1998, where Human Rights Watch says at least 2,000 mainly Hazara civilians were executed. Several bomb attacks in recent years have also killed and wounded scores of Hazaras in the country.
Some Hazaras who attended Thursday’s gathering expressed fears that members of the militant Islamic State (IS) group would carry out attacks against them.
“In these three months we have witnessed several explosions and suicide attacks,” said Qari Mohammad Reza Haidari.
“People are worried about Daesh’s influence and that they may get control of some parts of the country or challenge the (Islamic) Emirate,” he said, referring to IS with its Arabic acronym.

2,Pakistan welcomes US meeting with Taliban officials,The US and Taliban officials are meeting in Doha next week.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Thursday hailed US representatives’ upcoming meeting with the Taliban officials as a “welcome development” that would help address challenges faced by the war-torn country.
At the weekly media briefing, Foreign Office spokesman Asim Iftikhar said: “It would be a welcome development.”
Recalling Pakistan’s consistent advocacy for the world’s engagement with the Taliban, who took control of Afghanistan in August after the fall of the Ghani government, Mr Iftikhar said: “We have been saying, encouraging and advocating enhanced engagement of the international community with Afghanistan to help address its challenges.”
The US and Taliban officials are meeting in Doha next week.
US Special Representative for Afghanistan Tom West and Taliban Foreign Minister Mullah Amir Khan Muttaqi will lead their respective sides at the talks that would continue for two days. It would be the second meeting between the two sides since completion of the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan. The two sides last met in Doha in October.
Spokesman for the Taliban foreign ministry Abdul Qahar Balkhi, according to Afghan media, said that Muttaqi’s delegation for the talks would include representatives of the education, health, finance, security and banking sectors of Afghanistan.
Mr West had, along with special representatives of China, Russia and Pakistan, met Muttaqi and other Taliban officials on the sidelines of extended troika meeting in Islamabad on Nov 11.
Balkhi said that Taliban officials would discuss political matters, frozen foreign reserves, humanitarian assistance, education, health and security of embassies in Kabul in their engagements in Doha. FO Spokesman Iftikhar emphasised the need for unfreezing of Afghan reserves by the US. “Pakistan and other countries have been saying that it needs to be considered as a way of supporting the Afghan people who are faced with immense challenges. That remains our expectation,” he said.
The economic crisis caused by Western sanctions on Taliban regime and freezing of Afghan assets has aggravated the humanitarian and financial crisis in Afghanistan.
