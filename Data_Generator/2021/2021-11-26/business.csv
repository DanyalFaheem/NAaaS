0,70 enterprises get active status in special economic zones,Central bank report says special economic zones in Pakistan have further room for improvement.,"KARACHI: Within five months of its establishment in January this year, the Special Economic Zone Management Information System (SEZMIS) has facilitated speedy grant of the active zone status to 70 enterprises by the Board of Approvals (BOA) compared to 200 in the last eight years, said the State Bank’s report on Special Economic Zones in Pakistan.
SEZMIS is a digital solution for registering zones for BOA’s approval, and allocating plots and zone enterprise status to enterprises within the zone through an application made to the SEZ Committee. It has increased the efficiency of the filing system and contributes towards creating an enabling business environment.
As per the latest regulations, potential zone enterprises have to submit an online application to purchase land from the developer and apply for zone enterprise status through SEZMIS maintained by the Board of Investment (BoI).
In the last eight years the foreign direct investment (FDI) committed was $1,081.7 million while in first five months (January-May 2021) of SEZMIS establishment the FDI commitments rose to $646.6m.

Central bank report says FDI commitments rise to $646m in 5MCY21

However, the State Bank analysed the current SEZs situation in Pakistan with comparative study of the region as well as global trend.
The two main rationales and conceptions of SEZs around the world are islands of excellence and laboratories for policy reforms.” In both these conceptions, the SEZs in Pakistan have room for improvement,” said the SBP.
The current SEZ framework and the ensuing government decisions have envisioned SEZs as designated areas that offer a business friendly environment as per international best practices. “There have been some positive developments recently, such as the passing of the SEZMIS regulations, which prevent real estate speculation,” said the report.
However, that vision is yet to be fully implemented; the one stop shop has not been set up, whereas overlapping coordination functions have led to delays in provision of infrastructure and utilities.
“In addition, policy frameworks to ensure business friendly climate in SEZs with respect to skilled labour and facilitative legal environment have not been announced,” said the report.
As far as policy reforms are concerned, the current SEZ framework does not envision SEZs in Pakistan as areas that offer special policy and regulatory environment to businesses, said the report.
Under current SEZ framework, all the SEZ authorities, organisations and persons engaged in the creation, development, operations and management of a SEZ are required to follow respective applicable laws and standards of Pakistan including vis-à-vis environment, employment, procurement, and building code, unless specifically exempted, relaxed or otherwise provided in the SEZ Act, it added.
“However, the current SEZ framework does not offer exemptions, with the exception of building codes,” said the report.
Here, Bangladesh’s SEZ Act offers some useful insights. Not only does it exempt the SEZs in Bangladesh from various national and local government laws, it also allows the government to modify any other Act or do any other thing necessary to remove difficulties for growth and development of SEZs.
“A concerted effort is required to address the challenges to the growth of SEZs in Pakistan, by graduating the SEZ framework from one that focuses on first-time colonisation to one that also provides direction on operation and maintenance, financing, sustainability, monitoring and operation, and so forth,” said the report.
This necessitates deliberations over the creation of a separate centralised autonomous SEZ authority that would perform several functions. In addition to approving zones and developers, these functions include providing and updating regulatory guidelines; coordinating with relevant government departments across different levels on SEZ related matters; continuously monitoring zone performance aimed at providing best infrastructure and facilities within the SEZs; and assessing the impact of various policy reforms on the business climate within the SEZs.

1,SBP reserves hit FY22’s lowest level,Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry says $3bn promised Saudi deposit will land this week.,"

Salman Khan

 
KARACHI: The foreign exchange reserves of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), which have been declining fast since August, took the biggest drop of $691 million to $16.254 billion during the week ended on Nov 19.
The central bank on Thursday reported what was the current fiscal year’s lowest level mainly due to external debt repayments.
The country’s external account has been under dual pressure of debt repayments and rising current account deficit.
However, analysts said the situation could improve in the coming weeks or months as the negotiations for release of $1bn tranche with the IMF had been concluded successfully.

Fawad says $3bn Saudi deposit to land this week

The IMF in a statement on Nov 21 said the Pakistani authorities and IMF staff have reached a staff-level agreement on policies and reforms needed to complete the 6th review. The agreement is subject to approval by the Executive Board, following the implementation of prior actions, notably on fiscal and institutional reforms.
Completion of the review would make available $1.059bn, bringing total disbursements to Pakistan under the Extended Fund Facility to about $3.027bn and helping unlock significant funding from bilateral and multilateral partners.
“The inflow of IMF’s over $1bn would help the SBP to improve its foreign exchange reserves which would ultimately strengthen the exchange rate regime,” said Samiullah Tariq, head of research at Pak-Kuwait Investment Company.
Pakistan is also waiting placement of $3bn in the account of SBP promised by Saudi Arabia. With the go-ahead of the IMF, Pakistan could receive the promised deposit.
Information Minister Ch Fawad Hussain on Thursday tweeted that all the legal formalities for transferring of $3bn by Saudi Arabia have been completed and Pakistan will get the promised amount this week.

 



 
“The IMF clearance will also enable Pakistan to launch sukuk (Islamic bonds),” said Mr Tariq. The country is planning to raise up to $1.5bn through sukuk from the international market.
Since August this year, the State Bank has lost about $3.82bn mainly because of debt repayments. The foreign exchange reserves of the State Bank in August were $20.074bn, which fell to $16.254bn on Nov 19.
The falling SBP reserves have hit the rupee-dollar exchange parity. The US dollar is trading at much higher rates compared to the previous fiscal year mainly due to surging imports. The central bank in its annual report for FY21, released on Wednesday, estimated that total imports may touch $63.5bn by June 30, 2022, which will surely widen the current account deficit (CAD).
However, the SBP still believes the CAD would be 2-3 per cent of GDP while it has has already exceeded to 4.7pc in 4MFY22.
The country’s overall foreign exchange reserves fell by $777m to $22.77bn during the week. Also the forex holdings of the commercial banks also declined by $86m to $6.519bn.

3,Record 5.76m tonnes of paddy harvested in Punjab,The improvement in crop production is being attributed to a 6.7 per cent increase in the acreage.,"LAHORE: Punjab has reported 1.88 per cent increase in the average paddy yield for the 2021-22 season — ending in next few days — with Rawalpindi and Sahiwal divisions performing better in the average per acre yields of basmati and non-basmati varieties.
As per data shared by the Punjab Crop Reporting Service, the province has harvested a record 5.766 million tonnes of paddy, both basmati and non-basmati varieties, 22.31pc more than the target of 4.480m tonnes set for the season.
The improvement in crop production is being attributed to a 6.7pc increase in the acreage, as paddy had been sown on 6.314m acres as compared to 5.917m acres of 2020-21, and 1.88pc boost in per acre average yield for both the varieties combined — 22.83 maunds this season against 22.40 maunds per acre in the crop year 2020-21.

Official says basmati’s per acre yield dropped by 4.3pc

Crop Reporting Service Director Dr Abdul Qayyum reveals that the per acre yield of basmati, which claims around 70pc of the paddy acreage, dropped by 4.3pc to 20.76 maunds this year as compared with 21.70 maunds the previous year.
Rawalpindi division has scored the best in the average basmati yield with 24.25 maunds per acre, while Gujranwala division, which is considered as the belt for producing the best basmati rice, is on the lowest rank with 18.16 maunds per acre yield, he says.
Sahiwal division has outperformed other Punjab divisions in per acre yield of non-basmati rice with a score of 35.27 maunds per acre, he says, adding that Lahore division showed the poorest performance with 23.87 maunds per acre yield.
Dr Qayyum says that hybrid of coarse rice varieties are also being sown in different parts of the province due to higher yield and a separate survey is underway to ascertain the exact acreage of hybrid varieties.
About the trend of having two paddy crops in one season in some Punjab districts, he says at present it is a negligible trend in basmati producing areas where some growers harvest an early-maturing coarse variety first and then going for basmati. However, taking two paddy crops in one season delays wheat sowing which may negatively affect wheat output, he adds.

5,Adamjee Life seeks listing on PSX,"KARACHI: Adamjee Life Assur­ance Company Ltd (ALACL) is going public to raise at least Rs700 million, a regulatory...","KARACHI: Adamjee Life Assur­ance Company Ltd (ALACL) is going public to raise at least Rs700 million, a regulatory filing said on Thursday.
The offer consists of 25m ordinary shares — 10 per cent of the company’s post-listing paid-up capital — to be sold at a floor price of Rs28 per share, according to a draft Offer for Sale document posted to the website of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) to seek public comments by Dec 3.
Based on the interest from investors in the book-building process, the strike price can go up to Rs39.20 per share or 40pc higher than the floor price.
Although bidders will place bids for 100pc of the shares on sale, successful investors will be provisionally allotted only 75pc of the offer (18.75m shares). The remaining 25pc (6.25m shares) will later be offered to retail investors at the strike price determined through the book-building process.
One of the 10 life insurance companies operating in the country, ALACL is a part of the Nishat group of Mian Muhammad Mansha. Incorporated in 2008, the company sells both conventional and Islamic insurance products. Adamjee Insurance Company Ltd, which is a listed general insurance company, owns 99.9pc shares in ALACL.
“The principal purpose of the offer for sale is to enable the holding company to realise a gain on its investment in ALACL. Further, the public offering will enable the company to broaden its shareholder base by bringing in public shareholders, HNWIs [high net worth investors] and financial institutions,” said the document.
Speaking to Dawn, Topline Securities Associate Director of Research Umair Naseer said business growth in life insurance has been “considerably better” than that in general insurance. “Its products are also sold through bancassurance, which makes its target market bigger,” he said.
According to the draft document, the company generated 90pc of its total premiums from bancassurance, thanks to its partnership with 12 banks and microfinance institutions. In addition, the company runs its direct distribution channel with more than 2,300 agents that work out of 64 sales offices.
“It’s a promising company. It’s posted good growth, which will translate into profitability going forward. The life insurance industry has low penetration, which means the growth potential is very high,” JS Global Head of Research Amreen Soorani told Dawn.
Life insurance penetration, which reflects premiums as a percentage of GDP, has barely inched up in the last many years. It currently stands at only 0.6pc, significantly lower than prevailing rates in comparable economies.
From gross premiums of Rs192m in 2014, the country’s insurance industry grew at an annualised rate of 9.6pc to Rs334m in 2020. Premiums in the life segment alone registered an annualised growth rate of 10.4pc over the same six-year period.
Going by the gross premiums written by private-sector life insurance players in 2020, ALACL was the third largest player with a 14pc market share. The top players were Jubilee Life (41pc) and EFU Life (27pc).
