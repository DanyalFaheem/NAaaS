Provincial PDA president Abdul Majid told Dawn that the strike was a complete success in the province as almost all 1,500 petrol pumps remained closed.

Most motorists and motorcyclists had fueled up a day earlier but many were seen complaining about the unavailability of petrol and diesel on the outskirts of the provincial capital, including Charsadda and Kohat Roads.
Some PSO pumps that were open in the city and cantonment were mostly visited by motorcyclists.
Wahid Khan of Charsadda told Dawn that he went from one filling station to another to get petrol but failed as not a single filling station was open on the Charsadda Road.
He said he managed to get the fuel tank filled at a PSO filling station on the GT Road.
The resident said he took petrol in a plastic bottle home as it was not clear how long the strike would last.
The manager of a PSO pump said the company had ordered its filling stations to ‘keep storage at full capacity’, so he acted accordingly.
“We currently have sufficient petrol quantity and will continue serving visitors,” he said.
Petrol pumps in Bajaur district also remained closed, causing difficulties to transporters.
According to the transporters, almost all filling stations were remained completely closed across the district.
Talking to Dawn, the transporters from different areas of the region said the filling stations didn’t sell petrol and diesel after 7am.
They said they visited several filling stations but workers of any outlet were willing to give fuel to them throughout the day.
The transporters said according to the government’s statement, petrol pumps operated by PSO and some other companies will remain open across the country during the strike.
However, they complained that there were no filling station open to give fuel to them though most filling stations were operated by the Pakistan State Oil.
When contacted, All Bajaur Petroleum Association president Salman Khan, who also the owner of a PSO filling station, claimed almost all petrol pumps were remained closed across the district.
He said filling stations had been closed on the call of the All Pakistan Petroleum Association meant to increase the profit margin.
He admitted that PSO stations were remained closed on Thursday and that petrol pumps would remain closed until the further orders of the All Pakistan Petroleum Association.
All 225 filling stations, including those operated by Shell and PSO companies, remained closed in Lower Dir district.
All Petroleum Dealers Association, Lower Dir, president Mian Ali Jan told reporters that the strike would continue until the government accepted the demand.
“We’re provided with Rs2.5 commission when the petrol was sold for Rs38 and the amount remained the same after the price of petrol reached Rs148 per liter,” he said.
He said Rs400 million had to be invested to set up a filling station.
“We demand at least Rs6 as the commission. We will continue with the strike until the demand is accepted,” he said.

2,People’s disinterest in Covid vaccination perturbs health officials in KP,Health officials say they need the government’s support to ensure that the people got the jabs.,"PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has recorded four more deaths due to Covid-19 and 81 new cases as health department is struggling to inoculate people against the virus.
“Only vaccination can ensure safety of the people from the pandemic. We have proven medical evidence that non-vaccinated people are likely to die or face severe complications than the immunised ones,” senior health officials associated with the Covid-19 vaccination in the province told Dawn.
They said that presently the campaign slowed down owing to measles and rubella vaccination but the overall situation with regard to the momentum of vaccination was not up to the desired level.
They said that the government so far administered the first dose of Covid-19 to 12 million (52 per cent) people of the province and the second dose to seven million (38pc) residents of the 24.2m target population. 

KP records four more deaths and 81 new coronavirus cases

“However, the indications show that the drive will remain slow even after the end of the measles campaign. We will start full-scale Covid-19 immunisation after completion of the measles drive,” they added.
The health officials said that reason for snail-paced vaccination was simple. 
The people, who were health conscious, had long been vaccinated while the others got the shots when those were made obligatory for official documentation, attendance in educational and travelling abroad, they said.
“Majority of the remaining five million people, who haven’t been immunised yet, seem silent refusals. 
“The government has initially announced blocking mobile SIM cards of the unvaccinated people to ensure that all the population get jabs and we return towards normal lives but it seems the threat has not worked,” they added.
Officials said that health department set up 700 vaccination centres in the province that received people initially but later the process slowed down due to people’s unwillingness to get the shots. 
“We have to close down about 10 mass vaccination centres due to lack of public interest,” they added.
They said that after completion of measles vaccination on November 27, they would vaccinate 250,000 people per day against coronavirus. 
They said that it would need government’s support to ensure that the people got the jabs. 
“National Command and Control Centre (NCOC) has announced vaccination obligatory regime. It means that it is must for all citizens to receive shots and stay safe from the pandemic,” they added.
Officials said that district administration was closing shops and wedding halls besides taking action against unvaccinated drivers and passengers but it was needed to locate and vaccinate those silent people, who had not been traced yet.
“Blockade of mobile SIMs is an option to expedite the vaccination programme but it is the domain of federal government to take a decision in this regard. 
“However, we can recommend to NCOC if the situation does not show improvement in the next couple of weeks,” they said.
Officials said that linking vaccination with entry to hospitals also worked as three medical teaching institutions in Peshawar immunised about 400,000 people. 
The hospitals have made vaccination compulsory for patients and their attendants for entering the OPDs.
They said that the pandemic could not be controlled without full vaccination. 
The virus would continue to infect people, therefore, immunisation was extremely necessary against it, they added.
According to a report of the health department, the province has so far registered 5,829 mortalities due to the pandemic and 179,855 confirmed patients. 
Of the infected persons, 173,123 (96pc) patients including 176 recorded during the last 24 hours have recovered from the infectious ailment. 
There are total of 903 active cases in the province.
Two of the new fatalities occurred in Peshawar and one each in Kohat and Dera Ismail Khan. 
The number of hospitalised patients is 250 and 50 of them are on ventilators.

“We [PML-N government] had okayed an airport for Tanawal area but the current government not only scrapped the project but also withdrew Rs550 million funds released for the acquisition of land for it,” he told reporters here on Thursday.
The PML-N leader said the PTI government had also abandoned other development projects in Hazara division.
He opposed the holding of the party-based local body elections in the province declaring the upcoming electoral exercise useless.
Mr Yusuf, who remained Mansehra’s district nazim from 2005 to 2009, said the ruling PTI amended the Local Government Act 2013 empowering assistant commissioners instead of tehsil council chairmen in the LG system and thus, going against the idea of grassroots democracy and governance.
“If assistant commissioners are to enjoy absolute powers even in the LG setup, then what is the need for holding these elections on party basis?”
The PML-N leader said the LG system introduced by military ruler General Pervez Musharraf gave massive powers to the elected representatives at grassroots level but the LG system changed by the PTI government in 2019 reversed all that.
He said the government should restore district tier of the local government system.
BODY FOUND: A woman’s body was found in the Kunhar River in Malkandia area of Kaghan valley here on Thursday.
