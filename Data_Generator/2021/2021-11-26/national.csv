0,Pakistani students seek PM Imran’s help for their return to China,"Covid-19 outbreak drove 6,000 students back home two years ago.","ISLAMABAD: Around 6,000 Pakistani students, who returned home from China in the middle of their studies after the Covid-19 outbreak there two years ago, have not been able to resume their studies in the neighbouring country.
After running from pillar to post in their attempt to travel back to China, these students have now appealed to Prime Minister Imran Khan to intervene in the matter so that they could resume their studies.
The Covid-19 pandemic had started surfacing in Wuhan, the capital of central China’s Hubei province, in December 2019. Then a lockdown was imposed and international traffic was suspended to most of the countries.
Initially, Pakistan decided not to bring students back from China but parents and relatives of students started protests. The students also shared their problems and sufferings on social media.

Covid-19 outbreak drove 6,000 students back home two years ago

In January 2020, the students started returning to Pakistan and it was decided that they will be sent back to China in July of that year.
Now Covid-19 has been controlled, but around 6,000 students who have registered themselves with Pakistani embassy in Beijing could not be returned to China.
Adam Ali, an engineering student enrolled in a Shanghai university, told Dawn that the students of engineering, medicine, PhD and other disciplines had returned to Pakistan in January 2020.
“At that time, special assistant to the prime minister for overseas Pakistanis Zulfiqar Bukhari had promised that all students will be sent back to China in July 2020. We have been stuck in Pakistan for almost two years, but China has not announced a policy for Pakistani students.
“There are a number of students who have returned to Pakistan, but as many as 5,875 students have registered themselves with the Pakistani embassy in China with a request to make arrangements for their return,” he said.
“Our universities in China have informed us that the X Category (study) visas were not being issued and they (universities) were waiting for a notification from Chinese government to issue call letters. On the other hand, a local company in Pakistan, which collects passports of students for the visa, is not receiving passports for X Category and saying that there is a ban on it.
“Visas are issued for one year and after that a fresh application has to filed for new visa or extension. We have come to know that South Korea had taken up the matter with the Chinese government and a notification has been issued for the South Korean students due to which they have reached China.
“Since my childhood, I have been hearing that Pakistan and China are all-weather friends but unfortunately Pakistani students have been suffering,” said Mr Adam, who hailed from Attock but was in Islamabad on Thursday.
“We have held two meetings with Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on October 5 and then again on November 3 this year and he assured us of addressing the issue. But after seeing that no practical step was being taken to resolve our problem, we appeal to Prime Minister Imran Khan to help us and secure our future,” he said.
Gulmeena, a PhD student, said that “we also met Federal Education Minister Shafqat Mahmood twice and requested him to address the issue but to no avail”.
“Two months ago, the students also met Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Youth Affairs Usman Dar and he assured us that he will play his role in addressing the issue. Last week, Mr Dar again promised that issue will be resolved. We all are vaccinated and ready to stay in quarantine in China but unfortunately visas are not being issued to us,” she said.
Ali Raza, a medical student, said they also met Punjab Governor Chaudhry Sarwar but only got assurances.
“Medical students were studying online, but now the Pakistan Medical Commission has announced that online classes of medical students will not be accepted as it involves clinical practice as well,” he said.
Last week, Member of the National Assembly Shahida Akhtar, who belongs to the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl, raised the issue on the floor of the house.
Former education minister of Punjab Rana Mashood, who belongs to the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, has also spoke about the issue in the provincial assembly.

1,"Saudi Arabia to lift ban on direct flights from Pakistan, says minister",Passengers from 6 countries including India and Pakistan will no longer be required to undergo a 14-day quarantine.,"RAWALPINDI: Federal Minister for Information Fawad Chaudhry on Thurs­day announced that Saudi Arabia had decided to allow direct flights from Pakistan from December 1 after lifting a ban.
In a tweet, Mr Chaudhry said the Saudi directive would become effective from Wednesday.

 



 
According to reports in the media, Saudi authorities have decided to withdraw a ban on flights from six countries — Pakistan, India, Indonesia, Egypt, Bra­­zil and Vietnam — and passengers from these countries will no longer be requ­ired to undergo a 14-day quarantine in a third country.

2,Balochistan PA summons secretary on 27th,Non-implementation of minority quota discussed,"QUETTA: The Balochistan Assembly on Thursday expressed concern over non-implementation of minority quota in the labour and manpower department and summoned the secretary concerned to explain the position on Nov 27 in the speaker’s chamber.
The assembly session presided over by deputy speaker Sardar Babar Khan Musakhail directed the assembly secretary to write a letter to the federal ministry of information and urge him to exempt PTV Quetta employees from re-tests and interviews.
Leader of the opposition Malik Sikander Khan informed the assembly that the employees who are working in PTV Quetta for 20 to 30 years have been asked by the authorities to appear for tests and interviews to be conducted by private company, Abacue.
He urged the federal ministry of information to exempt these employees from such tests and interviews.

Non-implementation of minority quota discussed

Taking up another issue, he said the government contractors had been awarded contracts at the rates of 2018, but prices of materials had gone up by 70 per cent and as a result of that the projects are delayed and their quality is substandard.
Adviser to the Chief Minister on Minorities Affairs Khalil George Bhutto drew the attention of the house to the recruitment process for the cancelled posts in the labour and manpower department and said these vacancies were advertised on November 3, but the process was cancelled as legal requirements were not fulfilled.
The deputy speaker asked the labour secretary to submit a report on the issue in the next session of the assembly.
Chairperson of Women Parliamen­ta­rians Forum in the Balochistan Assembly Dr Rubaba Khan Buledi said the pending laws about violence against women should be approved. She urged the male legislators to cooperate in the approval of these laws from the assembly.

3,Supreme Court seeks ECP help in govt writ challenging poll order,Apex court wonders why local government polls could not be held on party basis.,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court has sought legal assistance from the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) as well as the parties involved in a challenge to the Peshawar High Court’s Nov 2 short order declaring unconstitutional the holding of village and neighbourhood council’s local government elections on non-party basis.
Headed by Justice Umar Ata Bandial, a two-judge SC bench ordered placement of the petition moved by the Khyber Pakhtun­k­hwa government before a three-judge bench after postponing further hearing till November 30.
The petition was jointly moved on behalf of the KP government by the chief secretary, secretaries of local government, election and rural development and law, parliamentary affairs and human rights as well as the provincial assembly requesting the apex court to dismiss the high court order.
During the hearing, the Supreme Court wondered why the local government (LG) elections in KP could not be held on the party basis as had been done in other three provinces.

SC wonders why LG polls could not be held on party basis

KP Advocate General Shumail Butt informed the court that the PHC had ordered holding of the LG elections in the province on Dec 19 when at present there was no mechanism available for holding the polls in the province on party basis.
Instead of issuing directives for the schedule, the high court should have granted more time for holding the elections in the province, he said.
The court asked the province to wait for the detailed reasoning of the high court order and consider promulgating an ordinance for holding the LG elections on party basis in a similar fashion as had been followed by other provinces.
Through its November 2 short order, the PHC had declared the provision of the KP Local Government Act for holding elections of village and neighbourhood councils unconstitutional and directed the ECP and provincial government to hold the forthcoming polls on party basis as it was in conflict with Article 17 of the Constitution.
The PHC short order had also requi­red the election of tehsil, city councils, village, neighbourhood councils, the seat of mayor or chairman and members of village and neighbourhood councils of Malakand, Baja­­ur, Mardan, Swabi, Peshawar, Now­sh­era, Kohat, Karak, D.I. Khan, Bannu, Tank, Haripur, Khyber, Mohm­and, Charsadda, Hangu and Lakki Mar­­wat districts to be held as per the sche­dule issued by the ECP in letter and spirit.
The KP government pleaded in the petition that the PHC short order had focused solely on the non-party-based franchise. It argued that this point had never been agitated before the high court by the respondents or petitioners; besides, the KP government also did not assist the high court in this matter.
The petition said that in order to comply with Article 140A of the Constitution, which required the provincial governments to establish the LG system and devolve administrative and financial responsibility and authority to the elected representatives of the local government and take democracy to the grassroots level, the KP government had announced the schedule for LG polls.
But, the petition said, the provincial government was surprised to receive the court notice regarding the filing of the writ petition in the PHC, seeking a declaration that the KP Local Government (Amendment) Act 2019 was ultra vires of the Constitution.
Subsequently, the KP government filed para-wise comments and the case was heard at length and was decided by issuing the short order on Nov 2.
The petition argued that the short order had superimposed a single quasi national model for the LG election when its model may differ from local area but the philosophy of the ground realities of each area had been defeated by the PHC order.

4,Anti-smog squads target factories as winter sets in,Action taken after pollution left 11m people in Lahore gasping for air,"

This Nov 19 picture shows officials of the Anti-Smog Squad arriving to inspect a steel factory in Lahore.—AFP

 
LAHORE: The anti-smog squad van careens through choking traffic in Lahore, on its way to track down factories belching out smoke — a seemingly futile task in one of the world’s most polluted cities.
Inside the white vehicle sits an armed escort protecting the six members of the team, who clutch a list of locations they plan to inspect that day.
They scan the grey, heavy sky for telltale plumes of toxic smoke that indicate a factory is breaking environmental laws.
“All we need to do is follow the smoke to get to the source, we don’t even need the lists,” says Ali Ijaz, the environment department official in charge of the new operation, which is due to run for a month until mid-December.

Action taken after pollution left 11m people in Lahore gasping for air

The operation’s five squads are the latest effort by authorities in Lahore, near the border with India, to curb an annual pollution spike that has left more than 11 million residents gasping for air.
Ijaz says they intend to visit 300 industrial factories in the sprawling metropolis that have been identified as being responsible for the worst emissions.
Air quality in India and Pakistan has deteriorated in recent years, with winter’s hazardous pollution driven by a mixture of low-grade diesel fumes and smoke from seasonal crop burn off, worsened by the colder temperatures.
Lahore is routinely ranked as one of the world’s most polluted urban centres, and frequently tops daily rankings.
The hazardous air quality can cause breathing issues that range from discomfort to respiratory tract and heart diseases.
But authorities have been slow to act, blaming the smog on India or claiming the figures are exaggerated.
This year the pollution has settled in earlier than usual, blanketing the city in stagnant, dirty grey air for days. Last week, provincial chief minister Usman Buzdar called it a “calamity”.
Closed at gunpoint
On a recent mission, one of the five teams heads to a neighbourhood where smoke billows from numerous factories and mills that operate among the city’s dense population.
“It’s clear the factories are using sub-standard fuel. These gases are unbearable for people with breathing issues,” team leader Sajid Ali tells AFP.
The air is a thick grey, and even with masks on it is difficult to breathe.
Piles of trash litter the streets where large gates mark the entrances to the factories.
As the team enters the first factory, they can tell the polluting furnaces have only just been extinguished — they are still red-hot, and newly forged steel rods are resting on the ground to cool.
The squad members ask about the fuel and machinery.
It emerges that this factory is missing a “scrubber”, a device that removes industrial pollutants from exhaust streams.
They swiftly shut it down and its workers are evacuated under the sharp eye of the armed escort.
This time, they stream out silently. But that has not always been the case, says environment official Ijaz, who describes “firing incidents” targeting his staff.
Although the squad is backed by legal powers, a lawyer threatens action and the two sides instead agree to simply seal off the machinery, and not the factory itself.
Compromises
It is one of the numerous challenges faced by authorities.
“A lot of factory owners try to pressure the squad through political influence and connections,” one of the squad leaders tells AFP on condition of anonymity. “It makes our work more difficult... We are forced to reach compromises.”
Authorities do not want to shut factories for more than a few days at a time, because the low-wage labourers are paid by the day.
Then there is the sheer scale of the task.
“There are thousands of industrial sites releasing emissions that cannot be tackled by six or 12 squads within just Lahore,” says environmental lawyer and activist Rafay Alam, dismissing the smog squad initiative as “cosmetic”.
Ijaz also does not hold out much hope.Even if they could shut down all of the city’s factories and cut traffic, that would only “reduce the smog’s intensity, but not eliminate it. We will face this for the long-term,” he says.

The leaders of the Gwadar Ko Haqooq Do Tehreek, after negotiations, gave three days’ time to the government team for acceptance of their demands.
Official sources said the provincial government had accepted four demands of the protesters and authorities concerned had issued an official notification in this regard.
One of the key demands accepted by the provincial government was taking over powers of running the Pak-Iran border affairs from the Frontier Corps authorities and handing it over to the district administration.
The official notification issued by authorities concerned was handed over to leaders of the sit-in.
It was decided that the Maritime Security Agency, the district administration and the fisheries department will conduct joint patrolling in Balochistan waters against illegal fishing of trawlers and drive foreign mafia trawlers out of waters of Gwadar district to protect rights of fishermen of Gwadar and other areas of Balochistan.
Speaking to protesters, Maulana Hidayat-ur-Rehman said that the government officials had handed over some documents about acceptance of some demands of the protesters “but we have no trust in them and have given a three-day deadline for acceptance of all demands of the people of the movement staging the sit-in”.
