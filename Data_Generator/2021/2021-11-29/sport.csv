0,Manchester City return to second as Leicester make Ranieri suffer,Everton have now taken just two points from their past seven league matches and are sinking fast.,"LONDON: Manchester City beat West Ham United 2-1 in swirling snow on Sunday to return to second in the Premier League and Watford manager Claudio Ranieri endured a miserable return to Leicester City.
Free-scoring Liverpool laid down the gauntlet by hammering Southampton 4-0 the previous day to move to within one point of leaders Chelsea, who host Manchester United in Sunday’s late kick-off. 
But reigning champions City stayed in close touch with victory at home to high-flying West Ham as the Premier League increasingly resembles a three-horse race.
Riyad Mahrez had a strike ruled out for offside at the Etihad but the hosts eventually claimed the lead shortly after the half-hour mark when a Mahrez ball into the box was deflected into the path of Ilkay Gundogan, handing the German a simple finish.
Declan Rice forced a good save from Ederson as West Ham threatened late on but substitute Fernandinho made it 2-0 to City in the closing minutes. 
Manuel Lanzini pulled one back but it was not enough for David Moyes’s team to avoid a second successive defeat. 
Leicester’s Jamie Vardy reminded Ranieri of his enduring quality even in his mid-30s, scoring twice at the King Power Stadium in a 4-2 win against Watford.
Ranieri, who famously won the Premier League title with unfancied Leicester in 2016, received a rapturous reception on his emotional first return to the stadium as an opposition manager since leaving the club early the following year. 
Midfielder James Maddison gave Leicester an early lead when he capitalised on a mistake by William Troost-Ekong, only for Josh King to level from the penalty spot in the 30th minute after Wilfred Ndidi brought down Emmanuel Dennis in the area.
Leicester regained the lead four minutes later when Vardy lifted the ball over goalkeeper Daniel Bachmann from an angle and the former England striker grabbed his second three minutes before the break when he glanced in Maddison’s corner.
Dennis pulled a goal back just after the hour when he robbed Timothy Castagne to race through and chip over Kasper Schmeichel but Ademola Lookman scored from close range to restore the home side’s two-goal cushion.
Brentford heaped the pressure on Rafael Benitez by beating Everton 1-0 to secure their first Premier League win since early October, courtesy of a first-half penalty from Ivan Toney.
Everton have now taken just two points from their past seven league matches and are sinking fast.
The game between Burnley and Tottenham Hotspur was called off a little under an hour before kick-off because of heavy snow at Turf Moor in northwest England. 
Attempts to clear the pitch proved in vain as the undersoil heating struggled to cope and snow fell as quickly as it could be removed.
On Saturday, Diogo Jota’s double and goals by Thiago Alcantara and Virgil van Dijk eased Liverpool past Southampton in another masterful display by the best attack in the league at Anfield.
Liverpool’s former skipper Steven Gerrard enjoyed a second consecutive win as Aston Villa manager with a 2-1 victory at Crystal Palace. 
Second-from-bottom Norwich City failed to make it three wins in a row as they drew 0-0 at home to Wolverhampton Wand­erers but they moved level on nine points with 18th-placed Burnley.
The match between Brighton & Hove Albion and by Leeds United also ended goalless, however, the point did edge Brighton up to eighth place, ahead of Manchester United.

1,Shaheen strikes to leave Chittagong Test evenly poised,CHITTAGONG: Pakistan’s fast bowlers reduced Bangladesh to 39-4 in their second innings at the end of day three on...,"CHITTAGONG: Pakistan’s fast bowlers reduced Bangladesh to 39-4 in their second innings at the end of day three on Sunday to leave the first Test evenly poised. 
Bangladesh had secured a 44-run lead after bowling out Pakistan for 286, thanks largely to the mesmerising bowling of left-arm spinner Taijul Islam, who returned figures of 7-116, after Abid Ali hit a century.
Instead, the home side ended the day by extending their lead to 83 runs but has just six wickets remaining. Mushfiqur Rahim, who made 91 in the first innings, was batting on 12 and Yasir Ali on 8 after surviving several close calls. 
“I think we can’t take it [losing four wickets] as a disappointment. This is the nature of cricket, Taijul said. “Nobody wants to get out voluntarily. We came back after being four wickets down in the first innings. We hope to do the same in this innings too.” 
Despite the first-innings deficit, Pakistan fought back through fast bowlers Shaheen Shah Afridi and Hasan Ali who used the short ball to precision, leaving Bangladesh in a potentially precarious position. 
Afridi cracked the game open, striking twice in his third over. 
He trapped Shadman Islam leg-before for 1 with a ball that swung sharply and then two balls later had Najmul Hossain caught at first slip for a duck with a short ball.
His short ball again worked for him when opener Saif Hasan gave the return catch and was dismissed for 18. 
Hasan also got into the act, dismissing captain Mominul Haque for a duck with a leading edge, leaving Bangladesh on 25-4. 
“We will try our level best to bowl them out quickly and hopefully [the] spinners will get into action tomorrow as well,” Shaheen said. “Our target is to keep the target under 200.” 
Abid earlier made 133 off 282 balls, holding one end for Pakistan for a long stretch after Taijul’s early strike of two wickets in two balls in the day’s first over. 
“Some patches are forming in the wicket for both off-spinners and left-arm spinners,” he said. “But we will definitely try to achieve whatever target is set for us.”
Faheem Ashraf added 38 late in the innings to keep Pakistan in contention before he was last man dismissed. 
Pakistan, who resumed on 145-0 and looked poised for a big total, suffered an early setback when Taijul trapped debutant Abdullah Shafique leg-before on his fifth ball. 
Abdullah left without adding to his overnight 52, and Taijul took Azhar Ali for a duck in the very next ball when the delivery hit him on the foot. 
Azhar was initially given not out but the decision was reversed on review. 
Babar Azam saw off the hat-trick ball in Taijul’s next over but did not survive long. Mehidy uprooted his off-stump with a straight delivery after the Pakistan skipper made only 10 runs. 
Taijul used his flight and variation well to curb the aggression of Pakistan’s batsmen and reaped the rewards again when he spun one sharply to dismiss Fawad Alam (8). 
Bangladesh sought a review after the umpire turned down a confident caught-behind appeal. 
The replay indicated the ball took a feather touch on Alam’s glove, ending his brief stay at the crease. 
Ali, who struck 12 fours and two sixes, was also lucky to survive after he was dropped at slip by Najmul Hossain off Taijul at 113. 
He was dropped again by Yasir Ali at forward short leg on 133 but it did not cost Bangladesh much, with Taijul taking him leg before two balls later. 
Pakistan had by then lost Mohammad Rizwan to Ebadot Hossain, who bowled 2-47. 
Taijul then dismissed Hasan for his seventh and second consecutive five-for. 
Taijul said he had to play with extra responsibility in the absence of injured Shakib Al Hasan. 
“Since he isn’t playing, I had to assume his role,” he said after stumps. “I have to manage the wicket-taker’s role as well as maintaining economy.”

2,Six SL women players test positive for Covid-19 in Zimbabwe,COLOMBO: Six Sri Lanka women cricketers who took part in a World Cup qualifying tournament in Zimbabwe have tested...,"COLOMBO: Six Sri Lanka women cricketers who took part in a World Cup qualifying tournament in Zimbabwe have tested positive for Covid-19, the country’s cricket board said on Sunday.
Cricket’s governing body ICC abandoned the qualifiers in Zimbabwe on Saturday after discovery of a new Covid-19 variant in South Africa, which prompted widespread travel curbs.
It was not known whether the Sri Lankan players’ positive tests were for the new Omicron variant of the virus.
The ICC took its decision after Saturday’s game between the West Indies and Sri Lanka was called off when a member of the Sri Lankan support staff tested positive for Covid-19.
“Steps will be taken to bring back the Sri Lanka women’s team from Zimbabwe,” the Sri Lankan cricket board (SLC) said.
The detection of the Omicron variant in South Africa has prompted some countries to tighten border controls and impose curbs on travel from several southern African countries, including Zimbabwe.
After the cancellation of the qualifiers, the ICC said that Bangladesh, Pakistan and the West Indies will progress to next year’s World Cup in New Zealand by virtue of their rankings.
The three nations will join New Zealand, Australia, India, England and South Africa.
South African sport began to shut down on Friday as the travel bans forced rugby teams and golfers to scramble to try to leave the country.

3,Pakistan miss out on quarters after losing to Argentina in FIH Junior World Cup,Argentina’s Francisco Ruiz scored their third goal in the final minutes of the second quarter giving them a 3-2 lead.,"BHUBANESWAR: Pakistan failed to reach the quarter-finals of the FIH Junior World Cup on Sunday after losing their last pool match to Argentina 4-3 at the Kalinga Stadium in the Indian city of Bhubaneswar.
By winning this game, Argentina reached the quarter-finals of the mega event with two wins from three games in pool D.
Argentina took lead in the 10th minute through a field from Bautista Capurro. Pakistan captain Rana Abdul Waheed equalised in the 17th minute by scoring on a pass from team-mate Rizwan Ali on a penalty corner.
In the 20th minute, Argentina’s Ignacio Nardolillo scored which again gave them lead. In the 28th minute, Pakistan earned a penalty stroke on which promising drag flicker Rizwan Ali scored to make it 2-2.
In the closing moments of the second quarter, Argentina’s Francisco Ruiz scored their third goal giving them a 3-2 lead. Ignacio Ibarra’s goal in the 47th minute extended Argentina’s lead to 4-2.
Aqeel Ahmed scored the third goal for Pakistan on a pass from Roman on a penalty corner in the 53rd minute. The 4-3 scoreline remained intact till the end of the match.
After finishing third in their pool, Pakistan will now be competing in a classification match with the US on Nov 30.
Meanwhile, Spain too booked their berth to the last-eight stage by thrashing South Korea 9-0 in a pool C encounter as they finished with six points from two wins, ending second behind the Netherlands, who thrashed the US 14-0, in the group. 
In another pool D match, Germany handed Egypt an 11-0 hockey lesson to top the group and reach the last-eight stage.

4,Iyer puts India in box seat on dream debut,"KANPUR: India’s Shreyas Iyer once again dazzled on his debut, hitting his second 50-plus score of the match to put...","KANPUR: India’s Shreyas Iyer once again dazzled on his debut, hitting his second 50-plus score of the match to put his team in charge of the opening Test against New Zealand on Sunday.
New Zealand claimed four wickets in the morning session to nose ahead on the penultimate day of the see-saw contest at Kanpur’s Green Park Stadium.
Iyer followed his first-innings hundred with a crucial 65, forging 50-plus stands with Ravichandran Ashwin and Wriddhiman Saha to revive India who declared their second innings on 234-7.
Chasing a daunting victory target of 284 on a worn-out track, the tourists were four for one when bad light stopped play. 
New Zealand opener Will Young was given lbw to Ashwin, which could have been reversed but the batsman was late to review the decision.
Tom Latham will resume on two on Monday with nightwatchman Will Somerville, who is yet to open his account, for company. 
“I think all three results are possible,” New Zealand batting coach Luke Ronchi told reporters. “If we bat with some good intent and make the most of opportunities to score them, then we certainly believe we can chase them down. From the Indian point of view, they’ll be going full of confidence that they can stop us from doing that.” 
Earlier, New Zealand’s Tim Southee (3-75) struck twice in three balls in the morning session as they blew away India’s top order after the home side had resumed on 14-1.
Kyle Jamieson (3-40) conceded a couple of early boundaries before he dismissed Cheteshwar Pujara, who made 22, to open the flood gates. 
Left-arm spinner Ajaz Patel further pegged back India when he trapped stand-in home captain Ajinkya Rahane leg before wicket for four with an arm-ball that kept low. 
Southee then twisted the knife by removing opener Mayank Agarwal, caught in the slip, and Ravindra Jadeja, trapped lbw, in a two-wicket maiden over to reduce India to 51-5.
Iyer and Ashwin, who made 32, not only steadied the innings but also scored briskly to put the pressure back on New Zealand.
Iyer departed on the stroke of tea but Saha soldiered on despite a stiff neck that kept him off the field on Saturday.
Saha remained not out on 61, having featured in a second 50-plus partnership with Axar Patel who made 28 not out before India declared. 
It was a memorable Test debut for Iyer who was selected only after several frontline batsmen, including regular skipper Virat Kohli, were rested. 
“I was aware I am the first Indian to score a century and a fifty [on test debut],” the batsman said. “In the end, we have to win the match, and that would be the most important thing for me.” 
Iyer said the hosts had the “spin power” to keep the visitors under pressure for the final day. 
Sunil Gavaskar was the last Indian batsman to score 50-plus in both innings of his debut test, a feat he managed against the West Indies in 1971.

5,"Djokovic’s Serbia stunned by Germany, Italy reach last eight",PARIS: Not even Novak Djokovic playing back-to-back could help Serbia avoid losing to Germany in the Davis Cup ...,"PARIS: Not even Novak Djokovic playing back-to-back could help Serbia avoid losing to Germany in the Davis Cup finals group phase on Saturday. 
After Djokovic helped Serbia pull even at 1-1 by beating Jan-Lennard Struff, the world’s top-ranked male player immediately joined Nikola Cacic in doubles. But German pair Tim Puetz and Kevin Krawietz showed more mettle in a tight 7-6, 3-6, 7-6 victory to take the decider and the tie victory 2-1. 
“It’s a great performance to beat the team who have the world No. 1,” Germany captain Michael Kohlmann said. “Before the tie, we all thought that we had a good chance. We really believed it and it paid off.” 
Serbia could still go through to the quarter-finals, which will include two runners-up to go with the six group winners. But Germany can seal their spot as the Group ‘F’ winners with a victory over Austria, who Serbia have already beaten. 
Playing without a public in Innsbruck due to virus restrictions by Austrian authorities, Germany took the lead when Dominik Koepfer downed Filip Krajinovic 7-6, 6-4.
Djokovic defeated Struff 6-2, 6-4 in the Serb’s 50th Davis Cup match. After a short break, he was back out there for the doubles that lasted more than two hours. 
Italy became the first team to book its spot in the final eight after it beat Colombia to take two points from Group ‘E’, which they also share with the United States. 
Lorenzo Sonego beat Nicolas Mejia 6-7, 6-4, 6-2, and Jannik Sinner followed with a 7-5, 6-0 win over Daniel Elahi Galan, in the matches in Turin. 
Daniil Medvedev helped the Russian Tennis Federation, among the title favourites, make a perfect start to their campaign with a 3-0 victory over Ecuador in Madrid, setting up a clash with Spain to decide which will go through as Group ‘A’ winners. 
World number five Andrey Rublev beat Roberto Quiroz 6-3 4-6 6-1 before US Open champion Medvedev crushed world number 149 Emilio Gomez for the loss of two games. 
Rublev then teamed up with Aslan Karatsev to beat Gonzalo Escobar and Diego Hidalgo in three sets. 
Australia, the 28-time winners, beat Hungary 2-1 in Turin but finished their Group ‘D’ campaign with a 2-4 record having lost 3-0 loss to Croatia in their opening match on Thursday.
Australia went 1-0 down against Hungary when Zsombor Piros, ranked 282nd in the world, claimed the biggest win of his career by beating John Millman 4-6, 6-4, 6-3. 
Lleyton Hewitt’s Australia finally claimed their first victory of the tournament when Alex de Minaur came through a three-hour match to beat Marton Fucsovics 7-5, 2-6, 7-6 (7-2).
The doubles pairing of Alex Bolt and John Peers sealed the tie when they beat the Hungarian duo 6-3, 6-7 (11-13), 6-3. 
Earlier, British number one Cameron Norrie completed success against France in the second singles rubber, beating Arthur Rinderknech 6-2, 7-6 (10/8) in Britain’s first Group ‘C’ tie. 
Rinderknech then helped Mahut keep their slim hopes alive of securing one of the two best runner-up spots by outclassing Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski 6-1, 6-4. 
Dan Evans had earlier given Britain a great start by beating Adrian Mannarino 7-5, 6-4. 
In Madrid, Kazakhstan beat Sweden 2-1 in Group ‘B’ with their doubles pairing of Andrey Golubev and Aleksandr Nedovyesov sealing victory after Swede Elias Ymer and Kazakh Alexander Bublik won their singles rubbers. 
Sweden remain top of the group, having beaten Canada 3-0 but Kazakhstan can win it with a victory over Canada.

6,"Shabbir fends off Matloob, Minhaj to lift Sindh Governor’s Cup","“I tried my best and was in contention till the very end,” Minhaj says.","KARACHI: After three years in South Africa, Minhaj Maqsood had returned to the Pakistan Golf Federation Tour and arrived at the inaugural edition of the Sindh Governor’s Cup as a relative unknown. 
But he’s left a mark for sure.
Having led the first two rounds, the 25-year-old from Rawalpindi was in the share of the lead with Pakistan’s top golfer Shabbir Iqbal halfway through the final round here at the DHA Golf Club on Sunday.
He ran Shabbir close. So did Shabbir’s long-time rival Matloob Ahmed. And a rollercoaster day provided a thrilling finish in which Shabbir (68) coming out on top with a total of 14-nder 274, just a stroke ahead of Matloob (65) and two ahead of Minhaj (69). 
It was also a finish that made sure that next time Minhaj plays on the circuit, he won’t be an unknown.“I tried my best and was in contention till the very end,” Minhaj, who did a diploma in professional golf during his time in South Africa, told Dawn afterwards. “I will try to pick up from this performance and do better in the future.” 
Minhaj had started the final round a shot adrift of Shabbir and his chances seemed well and truly over when he bogeyed the fourth hole, sending Shabbir, who’d birdied the second and fourth, four shots clear. 
But then, things swung in his favour. Minhaj sank three consecutive birdies from the sixth, where Shabbir double-bogeyed. Shabbir got himself back up with a birdie to close the front nine but Minhaj was level with him heading into the final nine holes and Waheed Baloch had also moved into contention at two shots back. 
The seemingly three-horse race at the turn turned to a four-horse race as Matloob started the back nine with a birdie before firing a spectacular birdie on the par-4 11th to move a shot adrift of the Shabbir and Minhaj. 
Shabbir and Minhaj traded birdies on the next three holes and by the 15th, Matloob had slipped two shots behind. Waheed was already out of contention by then. 
It was Matloob who made the move on the par-five 15th, firing an eagle. Shabbir responded with a birdie while Minhaj broke par. Matloob was now level with Minhaj, one shot off Shabbir. 
Shabbir and Minhaj both birdied the 17th, meaning at the final hole it was Shabbir holding a one-stroke lead over Minhaj with Matloob two shots back. Matloob birdied it to move above Minhaj, who bogeyed, leaving Shabbir to clinch it with a putt for par.

Hakan Calhanoglu continued his fine recent form in the 34th minute when he collected the ball and fizzed the opening goal through a crowd of players, and Lautaro Martinez added the second from the penalty spot deep in stoppage time. 
Inter have won seven of their last nine matches in all competitions — drawing the other two — and are on a high after ensuring passage to the Champions League last 16 after a decade away midweek. 
“The only negative thing was that we should have scored the second goal earlier,” said Inter coach Simone Inzaghi. “People said this was meant to be a transitional season, one focused on just saving the club, but I found a club that supports me totally and has an extraordinary bunch of lads in the squad.” 
It was another composed display from the champions which puts them right on the heels of league leaders Napoli and AC Milan, who are level on 32 points and both have a game in hand. Venezia remained six points above the relegation zone. 
Atalanta strengthened their hold on fourth place and Serie A’s final Champions League spot thanks to Colombian Zapata’s seventh goal in as many games in all competitions in the 28th minute in Turin.
Atalanta are six points ahead of their closest rivals for fourth spot Roma, who host Torino on Sunday, while Juve sit a further point back in eighth after the latest uninspiring display which led to them being whistled off by furious fans who watched their team lose for the fifth time this league season.
Massimiliano Allegri’s Juve have only scored 18 goals in their 14 league matches, the lowest total in Serie A’s top 10, and rarely looked like pegging back Atalanta until Paulo Dybala clipped a free-kick off the crossbar in stoppage time.
Juve’s defeat comes after a difficult week in which they were humiliated 4-0 by European champions Chelsea on Tuesday and then had police search their offices on Friday as part of a probe into suspicious player transfers. 
Two late goals saw Empoli complete an extraordinary turnaround and beat Fiorentina 2-1. 
Fiorentina seemed to be heading for the win after Duan Vlahovic’s 57th-minute opener but substitute Filippo Bandinelli leveled in the 87th and Andrea Pinamonti netted the winner two minutes later. 
Also, Sampdoria came from behind to beat Hellas Verona 3-1.

Erling Haaland scored on his return from injury for Borussia Dortmund to beat VfL Wolfsburg 3-1 and turn up the pressure on Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich on Saturday. 
Bayern responded by topping Arminia Bielefeld 1-0 in the late match, but there’s only one point between the teams before Bayern visit Dortmund next weekend for one of the league’s most anticipated games of the season. 
Third-placed Freiburg are eight points adrift of Dortmund after their 2-1 defeat at Bochum handed the visitors a third straight league loss. Milos Pantovic scored the winner from almost the halfway line.
Haaland hadn’t played in the Bundesliga since Oct 16 when he scored twice in a win at Mainz 05. He played three days later in Dortmund’s loss at Ajax in the Champions League, then dropped out with muscular problems. 
Coach Marco Rose delighted Dortmund fans on Friday when he said Haaland may return sooner than originally thought and he followed through by bringing on the Norway forward in the 72nd minute in Wolfsburg. 
Haaland promptly drew a save from Wolfsburg goalkeeper Pavao Pervan, then scored in the 81st with an acrobatic finish to Julian Brandt’s cross adding to an Emre Can penalty and Donyell Malen goal for Dortmund after Wout Weghorst had given Wolfsburg an early lead.
Bayern laboured for long periods against a defensive-minded Bielefeld team. Substitute Jamal Musiala provided the key with a brilliant diagonal pass forward to Thomas Mueller, who laid it off straight away for Leroy Sane to strike the winner from outside the penalty area in the 71st. Bielefeld remain second-bottom in the table, four points from safety. 
There was a nine-goal thriller at bottom side Greuther Fuerth as Togo striker Ihlas Bebou bagged a hat-trick in Hoffenheim’s 6-3 victory. The result moves Hoffenheim up to fifth, while Fuerth claimed an unwanted Bundesliga record with an 11th straight defeat. 
Sebastian Andersson scored in injury time as Cologne beat Borussia Moenchengladbach 4-1 in their Rhine derby while Augsburg backed up a shock win over Bayern last time out with a last-gasp equaliser to seal a 1-1 draw at Hertha Berlin.

It was only Metz’s second league win of the campaign and draws them level on points with second-bottom St-Etienne, who have a game in hand. 
Elsewhere, Lille striker Jonathan David missed a penalty as the hopes of the defending champion to get back in the race for European spots took a blow after drawing with mid-table Nantes 1-1. 
Burak Yilmaz gave them an early lead against Nantes before Ludovic Blas’s 24th-minute leveller. 
Jocelyn Gourvennec’s Lille, who are top of their Champions League group, sit 12th, one point behind Nantes.

The Netherlands striker scored just in time to defuse a Villarreal comeback and secure Barca’s 3-1 victory on Saturday, ending his team’s winless away record in La Liga and handing new coach Xavi Hernandez a second successive triumph in the league. 
Depay calmly went around goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli to score a dramatic 88th-minute goal that restored their lead and Philippe Coutinho added a stoppage-time penalty as Barca advanced to 23 points, provisionally seven behind leaders Real Madrid. 
Villarreal had fought back through Samuel Chukwueze to equalise after 76 minutes after Frenkie de Jong’s early second-half effort had seen Barca open the scoring. 
Villarreal, beaten at home by Manchester United in the Champions League on Tuesday, remain in 12th spot in the standings with 16 points from 14 matches. 
Barcelonas victory followed a fortuitous 1-0 win over Espanyol last week in Xavi’s coaching debut and a goalless draw with Benfica in the Champions League in midweek. 
“We dominated less than I expected but in the end we found the goal with Memphis. They are three golden points. You also have to be lucky. Villarreal did not deserve to lose,” Xavi, who coached his first away game since replacing Ronald Koeman, said. 
Earlier on Saturday, Rayo Vallecano moved into fifth as they held Valencia to a 1-1 away draw, with Isi Palazon scoring for their visitors midway through the second half after Valencia had gone ahead in the opening 20 minutes through Carlos Soler’s penalty. 
Iago Aspas scored the winner as Celta Vigo claimed a 2-1 triumph at Deportivo Alaves to end a run of three successive draws and move further away from the relegation zone. 
Getafe remain second from bottom but did get an away point when they held Mallorca to a goalless draw.
