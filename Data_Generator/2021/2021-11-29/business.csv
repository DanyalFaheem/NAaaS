0,Karachi — protected only by luck,"By the most generous measures, only 20-25pc of Karachi is covered by fire stations.","A family of five was stuck in the traffic jam on November 14 near Saddar. As the car inched forward, a fire brigade could be seen blocking the road while vehicles were directed down detours. Craning their heads, the family spared a thought of the shops burnt before conversation changed to the dinner party they were running late for. 
This is Karachi. The frequency of fires, blasts, muggings and shootings have desensitized the millions that inhabit the city. Being alive and safe is more a matter of luck than protection by municipal resources.  
Fire stations and qualifications “Karachi is Allah key hawale,” says a former municipal official resignedly, speaking about the city’s lack of fire-fighting abilities. 
Karachi has only 22 fire stations of which 20 are fully operational and two are on a shift basis. According to international standards, it should be one fire station per 100,000 people which brings Karachi’s requirement to roughly 149 (taking the most conservative measure of population of roughly 14 million). Even by the most generous standards, only 20-25 per cent of the city is covered as Karachi spreads vertically and horizontally. 

By the most generous measures, only 20-25pc of Karachi is covered by fire stations

Take Scheme 33 as an example — a huge area of over 26,000 acres commonly known as Gulzar-e-Hijri that stretches from Al Asif Square to New Sabzi Mandi on Northern Bypass. The southern edge of the scheme runs along University Road and touches Gulistan-e-Jauhar while the northern edge is near Gulshan-e-Maymar. And not a single fire station in the vicinity. 
The quality of firefighters is another measure where the country is woefully lacking. Internationally, fire-fighting is a competitive field. Having qualifications such as training as an emergency medical technician and a degree in fire science improves the odds. Here, “those who can’t find a job elsewhere become a fireman,” snorts the official about the roughly 700 fire-fighters that Karachi has. 
Logistics of water
Water is another challenge. While the fire trucks standing at the stations have water, it is only enough for three to four minutes of fire-fighting — 1,800 gallons of high-pressure water cannot last long in the face of raging flames.
The truck has to go back to the station — which are few and far away as mentioned — and come back with more water which takes a lot of time, especially when Karachi’s traffic is factored in. Generally, when a high-level fire 
incident is reported, the water board is alerted to send bowsers so that there is backup water at the scene. But those too get stuck in traffic. 
Internationally, the practice is to give way to ambulances and fire trucks, but here there is a lack of basic humane response to make way and let them go forward. 
These logistical and water challenges allow fires to increase in intensity even though a fire engine is dispatched from the station within three minutes of the distress call.
Water is not the only way that a fire can be put out, the other alternates are foam and powder depending on the nature of the fire. A fire engine has two components — three-fourths water and one-fourth foam compound. What combination is used depends on the nature of the fire and the sufficiency of availability of the chemical compounds depends on the number of incidents in the city. 
Historical data indicates that the dry winter months increase fire events as clearly evidenced by the recent fires of this month. 
Causes and no solution
The main cause of fire in the city includes short circuits, especially when generators are made to bear a too-high load and wiring issues. Man-made incidents are also common. 
And the cash-strapped city has no money or political will to invest in enhancing fire-fighting capabilities — a single fire truck snorkel costs around Rs400 million given the current exchange as fire-fighting equipment has to be imported. A snorkel allows firemen to reach higher floors, a necessity as the city’s skyline looms ever higher.
But the onus cannot be on the city administration alone — when high-rise buildings are made their codes need to account for the possibility of fires and basic facilities such as extinguishers made available. 
Karachi clearly does not have the capacity, manpower or resources for fire-fighting. Keeping finger-crossed seems the only available option.

"
1,Investment must for sustaining export growth,No reliable information is available on how much investment is being made to develop skill sets of employees of export industries.,"During July-October 2021, Pakistan’s total trade deficit surged almost 97 per cent to $14.845bn from $7.546bn in July-October 2020, according to the State Bank of Pakistan.
Little wonder then that the country’s current account deficit shot up to $5.084 billion from $1.313bn. And that caused an almost 9pc fall in the rupee value in these four months. 
Clearly, things are getting out of hand as far as current account management is concerned. If the total trade deficit is not reduced drastically within this fiscal year ending in June 2022, the deficit would remain high in the next fiscal year, too. And, the rupee will depreciate further. 
The PTI government, already challenged seriously on political fronts, can hardly afford it. As the 2023 elections loom closer, it is making hasty efforts to boost exports besides trying to retain growth in remittances — the second-largest component of the current account. 
But the export-boosting efforts are aimed at achieving some results in the short term. 
This means the next government that comes into power after the general elections of 2023 would not inherit a structurally stronger export sector.
To bring down the deficit without drawing down on forex reserves or without resorting to quick-fixes like seeking huge forex deposits in our central bank from “brotherly” or “friendly” countries, exports must grow at a high rate, say 15 to 20pc a year — for many years to come. 

No reliable information is available on how much investment is being made in developing skill sets of employees of export industries or in acquiring new technologies

But for exports to continue growing at this high rate in the long term, investment in the export sector is a must. Is that investment taking place right now is the key question. 
The government does not share exclusive data related to yearly investment in the export sector with the nation. But one good proxy is the capital investment (CI) as a per cent of GDP. Sadly, this indicator depicts a worrisome picture. In 2020, CI to GDP ratio for Pakistan was only 15.41pc, against 41.03pc for Iran, 31.54pc for Bangladesh and 28.42pc for India, according to the World Bank. A year earlier, in 2019 too, Pakistan’s CI to GDP ratio of 15.61pc stood far behind Iran’s 40.65pc, Bangladesh’s 31.57pc and India’s 30.66pc.
Another proxy for gauging the adequacy, or the lack of it, of the investment in the export sector could be the amount of foreign direct investment (FDI) flowing into some key export sectors like food and food packaging, textiles, leather and leather products, chemicals, fertilisers, cement and communication. 
Even a cursory look at FDI flowing into these sectors reveals that it falls short of what is needed to make these sectors raise their export volumes and sustain the growth rate in the long term. For example, even gross cumulative FDI in the textiles sector in the last three fiscal years totalled $154 million or $51m a year. During this period, the food sector attracted $136m FDI or $145m a year.  
Now, for the ease of making a comparison with other countries let’s look at total FDI as a percentage of GDP. (Looking at the total FDI inflows can give us an idea of how much foreign investment may have trickled into our export sector). 
In the past 10 years (2012-2021), FDI inflows into Pakistan never exceeded 1pc of GDP, stats gleaned from the balance of payments statements reveal.
The World Bank stats show that other countries fared far better — over ten years, from 2010 to 2019, in India, for example, FDI inflows as a percentage of its GDP ranged between 1.3pc and 2.1pc. And in Vietnam, the percentage ranged between 4.9pc and 6.9pc. Little wonder then Vietnam has emerged as a strong export powerhouse in Asia.
Last month, Advisor to Prime Minister on Commerce and Industry Abdul Razzak Dawood informed the nation that “investment of approximately $5bn is in the pipeline under which 100 new textile units are expected to be established.” The minister gave no further details. 
The actualisation of this investment in a key export sector — within a year or two — is all that matters. If that does not happen — and there are reasons to be sceptical keeping in mind 
rising energy prices and the diminishing possibility of subsidising energy prices for industries, sustaining the current high growth rate of textile exports in future seems unattainable. (Textile exports during July-October grew 26.5pc primarily due to temporary relief provided under the post-Covid fiscal and monetary stimuli package).
A third proxy one can use to form an idea of how much investment is being made into the export sector can be imports of textile machinery. Here we can see a silver lining. In July-October this year, Pakistan imported $297m worth of textile machinery from just $141m in July-October last year. In the last two fiscal years, the country already imported a little less than $1bn worth of textile machinery. 
But the world of industry — and exports — is the world of man and machine, technology and expertise. No reliable information is available on how much investment is being made in developing skill sets of employees of export industries or in acquiring new technologies. 
If the government is serious about pushing exports, it should come up with periodical reports on how much investment is being made in key export industries like textiles, food, IT and IT-enabled services — and how this investment paying off. The private sector must provide timely inputs.

2,"Nankana’s industry, agriculture and Sikh tourism",Lethargic farming may come under pressure owing to better road connectivity.,"


 
Nankana Sahib, a small and newly declared district in central Punjab, has had a revered history of more than 550 years. Established in the fourteenth century by a Bhatti raja, it was called Rai-Bhoi-di Talwandi till Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, was born here on April 15, 1469. He died on September 22, 1539, and the town was not only christened after the respected figure but also became a pilgrim spot for the last 500 years for the over 22 million Sikh diaspora spread around the world.
For over half a millennium, this sleepy town remained a lost part of district Sheikhupura — the largest district of Punjab — till three tehsils of it were taken away in May 2005 to create the new district. Most of the administrative pundits in Punjab were, and still are, of the opinion that it was more a political decision rather than an administrative one. Otherwise, a town that hardly had any economic, industrial or agricultural clout, never merited for secretarial services that were to follow the decision. 
Till then, it lacked even basic road infrastructure. “Travelling to Nankana Sahib was more of an experience in off-roading,” says Kafeel Ahmad, an old resident of the town. One had to change a few local buses to get to the town even when huge road development took place in other parts of the district, like the building of the dual-track Lahore-Faisalabad road.

Lethargic farming may come under pressure owing to better road connectivity as farmers will be compelled to respond to new economic opportunities for survival

Being tucked deep in the district for centuries is reflected in its agricultural profile. Out of a total 456, 661 acres (Pakistan Economic Survey), wheat claims 322,000 acres and rice 270,000 acres, completing the agricultural picture of the entire district. Even if more than once sown acres are factored in, the total cropped area for the entire year is stuck at 773,887 acres. “It goes beyond comprehension why the district is producing two traditional crops when it is sitting between two biggest markets of the province, if not the country ie Lahore (62km) and Faisalabad (58km),” wonders Dr Iqrar Ahmad Khan, vice-chancellor of Agriculture University (Faisalabad). The entire district is fertile, canal and tubewell irrigated and had the biggest markets in the vicinity. Why has it not gone, or is going, for high-value crops like vegetables and fruits? It was among the first areas that were treated under the Salinity Control and Reclamation Programme in the middle of the last century. The district was reclaimed and freed of salinity. Even after that heroic effort, the cropping pattern stays fossilised, Mr Khan regrets. 
“Most of the subsoil water in the district is saline, with pockets of better quality,” explains an official of the Irrigation Department. In irrigational terms, it is called “marginal to fit category.” Water is available at the depth of 25 to 30 feet in most areas, which means it does not cost much to pump it out. Tubewell density (19,161 in total) explains how people are utilising subsoil water. Some parts of it (Syed Wala, falling at the conjunction of Faisalabad, Sheikhupura and Okara districts) fall on the right bank of River Ravi and has good quality water. 
A local official of the agriculture department explains the reason behind this laid back agriculture. “It is largely because of big landholdings and absentee farming, especially in Nankana tehsil. Many of the big landlords do live in cities like Lahore, now only a one-hour drive away, and have left farming to their tenets. However, things are much better in two of its tehsils (Shahkot and Sangla Hill), where farmers are more progressive and innovative. They even experimented in tunnel farming but lost steam when they suffered losses. People next door (Sharaqpur, a tehsil which is still a part of Sheikhupura) have done it though. They made a good name and money in guava, and of late in strawberry, production and its farmers are much better off. Farmers in Nankana are, however, still to take that route. With road connectivity improving and the availability of examples of successful crops next door, things may start looking up shortly, he hopes.
“In fact, agriculture in any area is a result of three factors; climate, market and technology. Nankana has always lagged behind technology and still does. Poor road connectivity never allowed it to look beyond its own borders. Without technology and market, climate hardly matters. Take the example of maize. When the silage industry started developing early last decade, the farmers went for maize. In 2014-15, the district had sown maize on 146,600 acres, which was down to 63,000 acres last year because the farmers suffered losses; the industry refused to collect the crop from here due to freight factors. With road network now improving, along with motorway connectivity, the district may abandon its old ways of agriculture, hopes Khalid Mahmood of Shahkot.
The district, however, has made a name in industrialisation, especially one of its tehsils called Shahkot. Falling right on the Lahore-Faisalabad road, the town has seen massive industrial growth in the past three decades. According to the data of the Punjab Industrial Department, twelve textile mills now adorn the area. They are in addition to 151 rice mills, one sugar mill, 12 marble factories, five flour mills and 92 brick kilns. All these industrial units provided much-needed employment and place the district a few notches above many districts on a provincial industrial scale. 
However, they are also turning out to be a double-edged sword now and massive housing schemes are now altering the agricultural landscape. Small towns like Shahkot are turning into massive, messy and duty dwellings as they follow no town planning. These unplanned and unapproved housing schemes are de-shaping the historical towns to their core. A range of hilly areas near Shahkot has already disappeared as the government needed gravel for road building and investors for housing colonies.
Apart from industry, the district also makes money from religious tourism. Hundreds of thousands of Sikhs throng to the area every year for pilgrimage. “The cultural tone of the city is set by the Sikh presence in the area. On a daily basis, hundreds of them used to come to visit the residency of Baba Guru Nanak and Gurdwara Janam Asthan. This decrease owing to Covid-19 but it is now beginning to regain momentum,” says Tajamal Hussain, a shopkeeper near the Gurdwara. Most of the city monuments like colleges and, of late, a university are named after Guru Nanak and give the city its identity, he says. The annual pilgrimage on birthday celebration is a huge boost to local businesses when thousands of them converge in the city. Even in the worst days of tourism, Sikh tourism has survived, which can only be welcomed, he claims.
The livestock landscape is a bit better here with a large animal population that the provincial census says is 468,816. The smaller animals are 156,641 and backyard poultry number 165,396. The district has 66 poultry sheds. Some of them have already opted out of business as they suffered losses. “There is hardly any investment coming into the livestock sector anymore as,” says farmers whose losses are mounting.
“In the final analysis, this lethargic farming may come under pressure with better road connectivity and farmers are compelled to respond to new economic opportunities for survival and it remains the only hope,” Dr Iqrar concludes. Even the industrial development in the area is a pre-motorway phenomenon when Lahore-Faisalabad road changed the profile of the area. Otherwise, even this industry could not have been here. Let’s hope new pressures change old ways of living here.

3,Moving towards a bilateral-contracts electricity market,Challenges of moving from a single-buyer to a multi-buyer regime are huge but resulting benefits will lead to improved system.,"It was the advent of independent power producers (IPP) two decades ago that led to the branching of the Water and Power Development Authority into independent transmission and distribution entities. A much larger transformation is about to take place in the form of the competitive trading bilateral contracts market (CTBCM), which will herald the start of a fully competitive electricity market in Pakistan. 
Expected to be launched in early 2022, the CTBCM will allow the suppliers and consumers the freedom to enter into direct contracts with one another as the market forces play out.  
At present, the electricity transactions are done under a single-buyer model whereby the Central Power Purchase Authority Guarantee Limited (CPPA-G), an entity that was created out of the National Transmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC), buys power from all the producers whether government-owned generation companies (Gencos) or the IPPs as an agent of and on behalf of the power distribution companies (Discos). The CPPA-G also plays the role of system operator whereby it matches supply with the demand of various Discos. It also acts as the market operator and in this role it carries out the billing and settlement functions. The long-term demand forecasting function lies with the NTDC at a macro-level while the Discos are responsible for assessing the short-term demand for their respective regions.

The challenges of moving from a single-buyer to a multi-buyer regime are huge but the resulting benefits will be in the form of a vastly improved quality of electricity service at far more competitive rates than at present

With a mushroom growth in the electricity system, especially over the last two decades, not only do the roles and responsibilities of the various entities need to be realigned but new rules of engagement must also be defined. This has become important because the burden of the continued inefficiencies of the system eventually falls on the end-consumer in the form of exorbitant electricity bills. 
To do this, a transition is going to take place soon from the existing single-buyer business model to a multi-buyer model for which the Economic Coordination Committee had given the go-ahead several years ago. After several years of preparation, in early 2022, the wholesale electricity market will be launched in which all the power-producing entities will start selling their output. The wholesale market will evolve into a fully-competitive retail market in a few years in which all consumers will be free to buy from the seller(s) of their own choice that participates in the market. 
On the demand side, Discos that have 2.7 million consumers and, additionally, another 2000-odd eligible consumer, mainly comprised of industrial and commercial entities, will be the market participants. A real-time electricity market will put the onus on Discos to make accurate demand estimates as they will be signing fully commercial-based contracts with suppliers. The Discos operating efficiencies will need to be improved by investing in upgrading of their networks and undertaking large-scale system automation because, in a competitive environment, the Discos will be able to retain their market share only by offering a reliable and affordable service. 
For the customers of Discos, the new model will result in a lower unit cost of electricity. This is because any new production brought into the market will be through the holding of an auction by an independent body and only the least-cost supplier will win the contract. The output from existing plants will be procured on the basis of the marginal price of production which will be contracted on an hourly or daily basis and producers will be forced to offer output at the most competitive price.
The transition from a single-buyer to a multi-buyer contracts model means that the multiple roles that CPPA-G currently plays — system operator, market operator and agent — will be assigned to new entities. The wheeling of electricity will gain in importance and either NTDC or possibly a separate entity will assume this role. 
The existing power purchase contracts between the producers and the CPPA-G will be assigned to Discos which will result in hundreds of new bilateral contracts that will apportion a share of production of each generating entity to the Discos. The flexibility offered to the eligible consumers and the producers to enter into bilateral contracts will displace some of the power demand that is currently included in Disco’s forecasts. The market operator will require an adequate credit cover for meeting the financial obligations, which will mean that a robust financial facility will have to be arranged by the Discos with commercial banks. 
Making reliable demand forecasts, ensuring that the end-to-end distribution infrastructure is dependable, providing adequate customer service, system automation, etc, are only some areas requiring focus. The integrated, real-time market having many players also raises concerns about cyber security which will be another area of concentration. 
The challenges of moving from a single-buyer to a multi-buyer regime are huge but the resulting benefits will be in the form of a vastly improved quality of electricity service at far more competitive rates than at present.

4,Food insecurity in Pakistan,Increasing food availability is insufficient to end hunger and undernutrition.,"Pakistan ranked 92nd out of 116 nations in the Global Hunger Index (GHI) this year. With a score of 24.7, the country’s level of hunger is categorised as ‘serious’. On the regional level, Pakistan is better positioned as compared to India (ranked 101), while the other two close regional neighbours, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, outshine Pakistan by grabbing ranks of 76 and 65, respectively. 
GHI is aimed at galvanising global action to combat hunger. The index comprises four indicators including undernourishment, child wasting, child stunting and under-five mortality rate. While 37.6pc of children are stunted, Pakistan has been able to bring the proportion of the undernourished population down to 12.9pc from 21.1pc in 2000. Along the same lines, Pakistan has also succeeded in cutting down the percentage prevalence of wasting in under-five children to 7.1pc in 2020 from 14.1pc in 2000.
The report, jointly published by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe on global hunger, mentions: “As the year 2030 draws closer, achievement of the world’s commitment to Zero Hunger is tragically distant”.  Further, it contends that current projections show that the world as a whole — and 47 countries in particular — will fail in achieving even low hunger by 2030. In addition, the global report on food crises-2021 predicts that food crises will become more widespread and severe, with a bleak outlook for 2021. According to the World Food Programme, 41 million people are on the verge of famine.
Food security is being threatened on numerous fronts, with growing conflicts, extreme weather events due to global climate change, and the economic and health issues posed by the Covid-19 pandemic all contributing to hunger. Food insecurity is about more than just a scarcity of food in the market. It also indicates a lack of sufficient funds to acquire food, let alone nutritious and wholesome foods. 

Increasing food availability is insufficient to end hunger and undernutrition — it is just as essential, if not more so, to ensure that people have access to healthy and safe meals if the pervasive concern of stunting and wasting among children is to be dealt with

Over the last three years, Pakistan’s double-digit food price inflation, along with dwindling income, has left more Pakistanis food insecure. The World Food Programme (WFP) estimates that approximately 43pc of Pakistanis are food insecure and 18pc of those have acute food insecurity. The WFP contends that affordability is the “greatest barrier in achieving a nutritious diet,” estimating that the majority of Pakistanis are incapable of affording nutritionally acceptable food. 
Thus, increasing food availability is insufficient to end hunger and undernutrition; it is just as essential, if not more so, to ensure that people have access to healthy and safe meals if universal food security and the pervasive concern of stunting and wasting among children are to be dealt with. 
Our economic and financial policies have only exacerbated social and economic inequities while simultaneously increasing the number of people who are food insecure. To avoid future food crises, the government must strive to improve the value chain of fruit and vegetable crops while also ensuring the availability of storage facilities. The government must promote crop diversification, water management, and climate-smart farming to decrease the devastating effects of natural disasters on food security. Prioritising agricultural value addition and preserving subsidies for essential crops is also critical for the country’s food security.

5,Incentivising workers to raise productivity,The gross domestic savings rate (of which ...,"A major cause of low productivity is being attributed by eminent economists to firms’ hiring on contract temporary, unskilled, low paid and demotivated workers and employees with no training or skill formation.
To quote former State Bank governor Dr Ishrat Husain “the most lingering and persistent phenomenon that needs to be tackled is low productivity in our export industries” that, he says, is among the lowest in the region and only 30-40 per cent of that of China.
And according to the corporate sector, the underperforming workers compel employers to hire extra hands, which raises the wage bill and erodes their competitive edge.
To improve productivity, Dr Husain suggests a different approach instead of the current practice. He projects a scenario in which the overall productivity rises by 20pc by attracting, retaining, compensating well and motivating workers and employees. In that case, the split in the gains accruing to the owner in the form of profits would be 15pc and only 5pc to the workers.
Owing to low productivity and lack of competitiveness, Dr Husain observes that Pakistan’s share in the global export market has declined from 0.2pc to 0.15pc in the last 30 years.
Despite the free fall of the rupee to much below its real effective exchange rate and enormous stimulus provided for exports by the PTI government, the trade deficit in July-October went up by 103pc to $13.8 billion compared to the same period last year. Imports of goods accounted for $23.5bn against exports of $9.6bn.

The gross domestic 
  savings rate (of which 
  85pc comes from private savings) has declined from around 20pc of GDP to under 10pc between 2002 to 2020 — in India, the savings rate was 28pc

However, the issue of living wages for workers and fair compensation to employees needs to be seen and analysed keeping in view the big picture as it affects the country’s overall economic growth.
The size of the domestic market is determined by the purchasing power of the consumers who are also producers.  
In Pakistan, formal savings are very low, partly, as analyst Umar Javed says because Pakistan is a poor country afflicted by frequent rounds of low growth and high inflation. And an average of 40pc of total household expenses is spent on food. With such high allocation towards basic needs, he adds, there is likely not much to be leftover to save.
The gross domestic savings rate (of which 85pc comes from private savings) has declined from around 20pc of GDP to under 10pc between 2002 to 2020. In India, the savings rate was 28pc.
The importance of decent wages, domestic savings and investments for sustainable economic growth cannot be over-emphasised for a country under heavy debt and persisting external sector pressures. The solution lies in reducing foreign dependence.
The right to work and earn a decent living is inextricably linked with mobility and transport in the urban context, says Zeenat Hisam, a researcher in the development sector in her article on ‘Workers and Mobility.’
Transport is considered a key marker of economic development as it connects workers with employment. The International Labour Organisation defines public transport as a basic service, a facilitator of mobility and an enabler of other rights.
Ms Hisam quoted the example of Karachi where the public transport is inadequate, very costly and time-wasting. It is often difficult or even impossible for people to travel from their residence to workplaces. 
In their current year’s budgets, the federal and provincial governments increased minimum wages, squeezed by Covid-19 fallout and high inflation rate but trade unions did not consider it enough.
The wage increase to Rs25,000 per month by the Sindh government has also been upheld by the Sindh High Court which dismissed a petition, arguing that it will have an extremely adverse impact, even leading to the closure of businesses.
Labour expert Iftikhar Ahmed says the Wageindicator Foundation has projected Rs28,700 as the minimum pay for a standard family.
The Court also directed the Sindh government to ensure that all unskilled workers, men and women, receive the minimum wage including those in the informal sector.
Sindh has announced that private school teachers will be eligible for the minimum wage. Many teachers, particularly women, are reportedly paid as low as Rs5,000 while the schools charge fat fees. The schools have been warned that their premises will be sealed if they violate the directive.
However, the government’s role is currently restricted to minimum wage announcements which are not effectively implemented.
In the labour market dominated by employers, critics say losses of firms are socialised but gains are privatised.
Producing low value-added goods to meet the needs of low-income groups in developed economies, the export-oriented manufacturing sector prefers to employ low-paid workers. Instead of increasing productivity, it has relied on the stimulus provided by successive governments including the continuous devaluation of the rupee to boost foreign sales.
In some ways, the situation is changing in many countries including Pakistan.
The emergence of the ‘new economy’ job options have increased for some — if not satisfied, skilled workers are more mobile, often opting for self-employment or switching jobs, says Pakistan Business Council CEO, Ehsan Malik.
As the impact of Covid-19 subsides and employment choices increase, he says, the employers are paying competitive rewards to attract and retain quality talents.
Similarly, in the United States, companies report that they are facing manpower shortages because the retrenched workers refuse to work on previous salaries and often do not even accept the enhanced wages offered to them. The minimum wage has become a major issue in the most developed economy.
In Europe, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen wants all workers to be covered by a minimum wage, whether through national law or collective agreement.
This is in sharp contrast to the global corporate view that increasing minimum wages, or having a minimum wage, actually increases unemployment. To quote former Pakistan’s chief economist Pervez Tahir these religiously long-held notions have been demolished by the evidence presented by a serious academic. For his empirical contributions to labour economics’ scholar David Card was recently awarded the Nobel Prize — shared by Joshua Angrist and Guido W. Imben.
They did not theorise but challenged the received wisdom on credible evidence, says Mr Tahir and adds: their study demonstrated that the higher minimum wage had little effect on employment. Actually, there was some increase. Similarly, natural research dispelled the notion that unemployment benefits disincentives job search. In other words, Mr Tahir explains that businesses continued to grow, despite the higher wages cost.

6,Data points,Controlling information for national security,"Controlling information for national security
China has blocked public access to shipping location data, citing national security concerns, in another sign of its determination to control sources of sensitive information. The number of Automatic Identification System (AIS) signals from ships in Chinese waters dropped dramatically from a peak of more than 15m a day in October to just over 1m a day in early November. The AIS was initially developed to help avoid collisions between vessels and support rescue efforts in the event of a disaster. But it also became a valuable tool to enhance supply chain visibility and for governments to track activity in overseas ports. “The intelligence extracted from this data endangers China’s economic security and the harm cannot be ignored,” warned a Chinese state media report on November 1 on AIS stations in the coastal province of Guangdong. Companies wanting to send important data abroad now need to undergo a security assessment with the country’s data watchdog.

A world of ‘Muskism’
In recent weeks, the term “metaverse” has started popping up all over the place. While it actually comes from a 1992 science fiction novel, the idea is much older: one example is the holodeck that appeared in the “Star Trek” franchise. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos was obsessed with the TV show as a kid; last month he sent William Shatner, the actor who played Captain Kirk in the original series, into space. “Billionaires, having read stories of world-building as boys, are now rich enough, as men, to build worlds,” writes Jill Lepore. “The metaverse is at once an illustration of and a distraction from a broader and more troubling turn in the history of capitalism.” Ms Lepore says the Shatner stunt is just one example of ‘Muskism’ in which today’s biggest tech companies have been creating more and more grandiose missions. Muskism is a form of capitalism in which companies worry about all manner of world-ending disasters, about the all-too-real catastrophe of climate change, but more often about mysterious ‘existential risks’ from which only techno-billionaires, apparently, can save us.

Stipend for remote work vs WFH
Companies shifting permanently to remote work should consider offering employees a coworking stipend. That way, those who want to work from home can, but those who need another space to work can choose from a variety of coworking options. This idea is not without precedent: Automattic, the company behind WordPress, created a stir in 2017 when it shut down its San Francisco office because no one was showing up. Instead, it offered a $250 monthly coworking stipend to employees who preferred to not work from home. Other companies, such as Basecamp, Mozilla, and GitLab, have similar policies. Here are the benefits:1) It gives employees the flexibility and autonomy to choose what is right for them. 2) It helps in recruiting talent. 3) It can help your company appear more professional. 4) It can help your employees be more innovative, well connected, and productive. 5) It can help your company save costs.

Professor-less universities
In Pakistan, politicians seek to please their constituency by building universities regardless of professors or quality since the focus is on ‘brick and mortar’. Higher Education Commission (HEC) guidelines for a university, too, are focused on land and hardware with no requirement of professors or quality. Consequently, universities in Pakistan are not successful in imparting quality education and thus award extremely poor-quality degrees to students. The Public Sector Development Programme allocations must focus on financing professors. Given the high failure rates and dropouts, human capital flight, and emitted peer review, HEC scholarships are a very inefficient way of nurturing professors. In addition, since publications and PhD quality standards are loosely defined, quality assurance is limited, and knowledge capital remains of uncertain level, vitiating peer review. It is important to jumpstart the 231 universities that Pakistan has.

13,Trends in e-commerce in Pakistan,Most people do not trust e-commerce in Pakistan which is why cash on delivery is still the preferred method.,"One of the major winners from Covid-19 globally has been e-commerce companies. Based on data published by InsiderIntelligence, global online sales in 2021 are expected to be 19.5 per cent, compared to 13.9pc in 2019, a 45pc increase in 2 years. Pakistan has not been excluded from this trend; based on data published by the State Bank, the number of registered e-commerce merchants in Pakistan increased from 1,707 in 2019-20, to 3,003 in 2020-21, a 76pc increase. 
In Pakistan, e-commerce tends to be dominated by business to consumer (B2C) companies. There are three main sectors, general e-commerce, groceries/quick(q)-commerce and fashion.
The most fiercely contested current sector in Pakistan is quick commerce/groceries, where Foodpanda and Airlift are the two big companies battling it out for market supremacy. Both have adopted the dark store model which requires a limited number of stock keeping units (SKUs) being stocked in different strategic locations spread across different neighbourhoods, allowing both companies to promise a sub-30-minute delivery in major cities. Another start-up, Munchies has raised $2.5 million to follow the dark store model and have launched operations in Karachi recently. 
The reason for such big raises is that the dark store model requires heavy capital investment upfront to get operations up and running. Further, other big brand retailers (Carrefour, Al-Fatah, Metro etc) and start-ups (Grocer app, Hum mart, Cheetah, Bykea amongst others) are trying to compete in this space using different models. 

Most people do not trust e-commerce in Pakistan which is why cash on delivery is still the preferred method for payment for the majority of online orders

Despite all the funding being raised by q-commerce companies, a fundamental question remains. Is q-commerce a model that will work in Pakistan? Pakistan has a lifestyle where the pace of life is slower compared to the US/Europe. The affluent have employed paid help and people tend to use shopping as an excuse to get out of the house as there are fewer leisure activities available. Right now, customers are using the services since there are multiple discounts doing the rounds as start-ups are fully funded and focused on obtaining customers. The question this raises is, how sticky and loyal will such customers be? 
Fashion is an interesting sub-market as all the major retail brands have a significant presence online, and a few of them do limited stock drops online, which get sold in a matter of hours. Further, there is a variety of direct-to-consumer brands which exist based on social media targeting, particular categories (eg Fitted for men’s polos, Genie for Jeans), companies that buy stock from local factories and sell online (ExportLeftovers as a prime example). There is room for a bigger multibrand store/aggregator and clicky.pk and Buraqstore are vying for that space.
Global trends in fashion that have started in Pakistan but haven’t picked up are re-commerce (selling/renting of used clothes) and personal styling. Secret Stash is one local company that wants to create a marketplace for re-commerce, just like TredUp has done in the US.  
Rent It, on the other hand, provides the opportunity to consumers to rent a dress by big fashion designers. There is economic sense to do this in Pakistan, and global comparables exist like Rent the Runway in the US, though they provide a monthly subscription of designer clothing to their customers.
Personal styling companies which utilise data and algorithms to suggest clothes have not been started in Pakistan yet. The US has StitchFix and is a space to look out for in the future.
By far the biggest player in e-commerce is Daraz, which doesn’t face any direct established competition. Incubated by Rocket Internet, and sold to AliBaba in 2018, Daraz has the financial muscle of AliBaba behind it and has been spending huge sums of money to bring e-commerce to the forefront of the public using their annual deals day, through sponsorships or more recently by streaming the T20 World Cup for free. Daraz wants to position itself as the premier e-commerce service with endless selection and quick delivery.
However, this doesn’t solve the company’s greatest challenge — an inherent lack of trust in the brand. This was at full display when a video of children from Gilgit unpacking a drone ordered from Daraz went viral last year because the listing was fake and the box was empty. A major reason for the video going viral is that this is an experience many Daraz users had felt at some point or the other. This is further validated by it having a score of 1.7/5 on Trustpilot, and being ranked 168/468 marketplaces for trust by Sitejabber.
Daraz launched DarazMall in 2019 to counter this, where only established brands sell their products to customers. OLX Group also launched their B2C competitor for Daraz, called OLXMall in November 2021. 
This lack of trust is a mindset that most people in Pakistan approach e-commerce with. Furthermore, this is also the reason that cash on delivery is still the preferred method for payment for the majority of the online orders, which further compounds most vendors problems with the platform.
For e-commerce to grow further in Pakistan, the challenges to solve are clear — further digitise payments, improve last-mile logistics and better regulate to protect customers and empower them to claim refunds and return the products.

14,Europe’s Christmas markets warily open as Covid cases rise,Christmas is 40 per cent of annual revenue for many retailers and restaurateurs.,"The holiday tree is towering over the main square in this central German city, the chestnuts and sugared almonds are roasted, and kids are clambering aboard the merry-go-round just like they did before the pandemic. But a surge in coronavirus infections has left an uneasy feeling hanging over Frankfurt’s Christmas market.
To savour a mug of mulled wine, an uncomplicated rite of winter in pre-pandemic times, masked customers must pass through a one-way entrance to a fenced-off wine hut, stopping at the hand sanitiser station. Elsewhere, security officers check vaccination certificates before letting customers head for the steaming sausages and kebabs.
Despite the pandemic inconveniences, stall owners selling ornaments, roasted chestnuts and other holiday-themed items in Frankfurt and other European cities are relieved to be open at all for their first Christmas market in two years, especially with new restrictions taking effect in Germany, Austria and other countries as Covid-19 infections hit record highs. Merchants who have opened are hoping for at least a fraction of the pre-pandemic holiday sales that can make or break their businesses.

Christmas is 40 per cent of annual revenue for many retailers and restaurateurs

Others aren’t so lucky. Many of the famous holiday events have been cancelled in Germany and Austria. With the market closures, goes the money that tourists would spend in restaurants, hotels and other businesses.
Jens Knauer, who crafts intricate, lighted Christmas-themed silhouettes that people can hang in windows, said his hope was simply that the Frankfurt market stays open as long as possible.
While Christmas is 40 per cent of annual revenue for many retailers and restaurateurs, with me, it’s 100pc, Knauer said. If I can stay open for three weeks, I can make it through the year.
Purveyors are on edge after other Christmas markets were abruptly shut down in Germany’s Bavaria region, which includes Nuremberg, home of one of the biggest and best-known markets. Stunned exhibitors in Dresden had to pack up their goods when authorities in the eastern Saxony region suddenly imposed new restrictions amid soaring infections. Austria’s markets closed as a 10-day lockdown began last Monday, with many stall owners hoping they can reopen if it’s not extended. The Czech government last Thursday closed Christmas markets as part of measures to counter a record surge in cases.
Markets usually attract elbow-to-elbow crowds to row upon row of ornament and food sellers, foot traffic that spills over into revenue for surrounding hotels and restaurants. This year, the crowds at Frankfurts market were vastly thinned out, with the stalls spread out over a larger area.
Heiner Roie, who runs a mulled wine hut in the shape of a wine barrel, said he’s assuming he will see half the business he had in 2019. A shutdown would cause immense financial damage it could lead to complete ruin since we haven’t made any income in two years, and at some point, the financial reserves are used up.
But if people have a little discipline and observe the health measures, I think we’ll manage it, he said.
Next door, Bettina Roie’s guests are greeted with a sign asking them to show their vaccination certificates at her stand serving Swiss raclette, a popular melted cheese dish.
The market “has a good concept because what we need is space, room, to keep some distance from each other,” she said. In contrast to a bricks-and-mortar restaurant, they have their building and their walls, but we can adjust ourselves to the circumstances.
The latest spike in Covid-19 cases has unsettled prospects for Europe’s economic recovery, leading some economists to hedge their expectations for growth in the final months of the year.
Holger Schmieding, the chief economist at Berenberg Bank in London, has cut his forecast for the last three months of the year in the 19 countries that use the euro from 0.7pc to 0.5pc. But he noted that the wave of infections is having less impact across the broad economy because vaccinations have reduced serious illnesses and many companies have learned to adjust.
That is cold comfort to Germany’s DEHOGA restaurant and hotel association, which warned of a hail of cancellations and said members were reporting every second Christmas party or other special event was being called off.
Other European countries where the pandemic isn’t hitting as hard are returning to old ways. 
It will have 104 stalls of nativity figures, decorations and traditional sweets in a country where 89pc of those 12 or older are fully vaccinated. Last year, it had half the number of stalls and restricted the number of people allowed in the square. Masks and social distancing will remain mandatory, organisers said.
In Hungary’s capital of Budapest, Christmas markets have been fenced off and visitors must show proof of vaccination to enter.
Gyorgy Nagy, a producer and seller of handmade glazed crockery, said the restrictions initially stirred worries of fewer shoppers. But business has been good so far.
I don’t think the fence is bad, he said. At the beginning, we were scared of it, really scared, but I think its fine... I dont think it will be a disadvantage.
Markets opening reflects a broader spectrum of loose restrictions in Hungary, even as new Covid-19 cases have exceeded peaks seen during a devastating surge last spring. More infections were confirmed last week than in other weeks since the pandemic started.

15,Deregulating fertiliser industry,"Around 90pc of the farmers own around 48pc of the land, with a size of less than 12.5 acres.","

Engro Fertilizers Chief Financial Officer Imran Ahmed

 
Engro Fertilizers Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Imran Ahmed has more than 20 years of diversified work experience in leadership and management positions in large firms in Pakistan and abroad. 
He recently spoke with Dawn on issues relating to deregulation of the fertiliser industry and the development of an effective mechanism for providing direct, smart subsidy to the small farm holder, and how these policy changes will benefit the stakeholders: small farmers, urea producers, government, and on and on. 
“There’s a perception in the market that urea manufacturers are profitable because they get gas at subsidised prices. No sir; that is not correct perception. We are profitable because we are internationally competitive even without subsidised gas and can even fetch export revenues of $400-500 million a year if deregulated,” Mr Ahmed says as he gives details of a 10-year analysis of the industry. 
“The analysis shows that the subsidy passed on by the industry to the farmers is way more than what we have received by way of subsidised gas prices from the government. The industry has foregone at least Rs500bn in its revenues in the last 10 years by selling urea to growers at highly discounted rates compared with the international prices.” 
Currently, the producers are getting a subsidy of Rs842 per mmbtu on gas but say they are competitive even at the current LNG prices if deregulated and allowed to charge import parity prices for their urea. 

Around 90pc of the farmers own around 48pc of the land, with a size of less than 12.5 acres — these smallholders need to be subsidised and not the 10pc who own 52pc of land

“You withdraw subsidy, provide us gas at the WACOG (or weighted average cost of gas) and let us sell our product at import parity price. We will show you that we are internationally competitive and can earn more money and even export,” Mr Ahmed insists. 
Pakistan’s fertiliser industry is a major contributor towards the agriculture sector of the country. The sector contributes around 4.4 per cent to large-scale manufacturing and nearly 1pc to GDP. According to Pakistan Credit Rating Agency (Pacra), the industry’s revenues in 2020 stood at Rs381 billion. The Pacra report says local urea prices operate at a significant discount to the international urea price. The delta between the two rose to as high as about 41pc and 36pc in 2018 and 2019. According to the urea makers, the delta rose to over 80pc this year as the international commodity prices jumped on supply disruptions and because of other factors in the post-Covid period. 
The urea industry made an investment of Rs162bn in capacity expansions and plant upgrades in the last 10 years and its ability to meet the domestic demand has shielded Pakistan from the Covid-induced shocks in global urea prices that have surged by 86pc since last year. Through import substitution, the fertiliser industry is estimated to contribute more than $3bn towards reducing the trade deficit in 2021. As a result of the significantly lower prices, the local fertiliser industry will save farmers from an additional burden of Rs363bn.
The return on equity and return on assets of the fertiliser industry at 33pc and 11pc are, the producers said, much lower than major industries, including food and personal goods, automobiles, and oil exploration and production. The return on equity and return on assets for other industries are as high as 67pc and 19oc. 
“Currently the fertiliser industry is providing urea at a significant discount of Rs5000/50kg bag compared to imported fertiliser. By deregulating the industry and introducing WACOG for all manufacturers, including indigenous gas and imported RLNG-based plants, the government can earn higher revenues and reduce the country’s fiscal imbalance,” he contends. 
That means urea will be available to the growers at much higher prices compared to import parity costs. “Agricultural productivity and framers incomes, especially at the bottom of the pyramid, could take a massive hit if no countermeasures are taken to mitigate this adverse outcome; the government will need to implement smart subsidy mechanism for smallholders.”
Mr Ahmed says the removal of gas subsidies to the urea producers will transfer Rs89bn from the industry to the national exchequer, which is more than the amount it needs to finance the targeted subsidy of around Rs65bn for small landholders. It will still save Rs24bn. 
“Around 90pc of the farmers own around 48pc of the land, with a size of less than 12.5 acres. These smallholders need to be subsidised and not the 10pc who own 52pc of land. The equal flow of subsidies to both big and small growers has to be stopped. You cannot treat a person who earns Rs10m and another who takes home a couple of hundred thousand equally. How long can we sustain these kinds of policies? Especially, when the International Monetary Fund is breathing down our neck?”
Mr Ahmed acknowledges that food inflation is one of the biggest challenges facing people and the government. But he stresses that urea prices do not have any impact on food inflation. He says fertilisers form just 2.4pc-3pc of the farm input costs. “The removal of feed gas subsidy on the production of urea and diammonium phosphate (DAP) will not have a significant impact on the prices of major crops and resultant expenditure of family households in Pakistan.” 
According to his calculations, every Rs50 per bag increase in urea price has an impact of only 1 paisa on the price of a ‘roti’. The impact of a Rs50/bag increase in urea price on other agri commodities like rice, sugar, maize, potato, tomato and banana is all within 10 paisas per kilo.

16,The dissipating euphoria,All good things in life come to an end. The bonhomie between the govt and the private sector seems to be taking that road.,"THE pleasant phase of the relationship between the government and the private sector, spanning over a year-and-a-half, seems to be coming to an end, as the recently released official data has exposed the fragility of the industrial growth base in the country. 
Business leaders express their frustration over what they see as poor handling of affairs by the PTI team, but they do prefer not to be openly critical.
The Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) reported 5.1 per cent growth in large-scale manufacturing (LSM) in the first quarter of FY22 (July-Sept 2021); a little higher compared to the corresponding period in the previous year when, in the thick of the pandemic, LSM posted 5pc growth riding on the back of the stimulus package. 
In September industrial growth dipped to 1.1pc, which was in sharp contrast to a 16-year high of 14.8pc achieved during the last fiscal.
According to PBS: “The LSM output increased by 1.19pc for September 2021, compared to September 2020, and decreased by 0.72pc if compared to August 2021”.
Signs of deceleration noted in the first quarter of the current fiscal are disturbing as the economy has yet to absorb the brunt of monetary tightening and fiscal stabilisation measures. 
Disregarding his earlier assurances to the private sector for a gradual and measured increase, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) abruptly raised the policy rate by 150 basis points to 8.5pc earlier this month. 

All good things in life come to an end. The bonhomie between the govt and the private sector seems to be taking that road

The SBP maintained a low policy rate for 15 months after a sharp 625bps reduction in key rates during March-June 2020. From 13.25pc, the interest rate was revised down to 7pc in three months last year. The SBP also adopted several policy tools for economic revival, which, according to the central bank, “stood around five per cent of GDP by the end of FY21.”
Refinance and Rozgar schemes were launched, the policy of loan deferment and restructuring moderated the stress levels and created fiscal space for businesses, and the Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) shored up the productive capacity in the country.
The central bank also took multiple other supportive steps to boost digitalisation, easing credit requirements and promoting housing finance. 
Citing economic compulsions, the federal government raised power and petrol prices multiple times and did not hide its intention of increasing them further. It also hinted at the reversal of subsidies, amnesty scheme and tax concessions that it had doled out in FY21 to stimulate economic activity in the wake of the Covid-19 shock.
The cost of production was moderated by curtailing duties on imported raw material and the elimination of peak-hour power rates. The government also disbursed long-stuck GST refunds and extended the amnesty scheme till June 2021. The generous stimulus package and business environment boosted confidence and energised the manufacturing sector. 
However, in July/SEPT 2021 out of 15 industries monitored, 12 recorded a growth in output, while production in the remaining three sectors contracted (Table).
Khusro Bakhtiar, the Minister for Industries, was approached, but his response did not reach Dawn till the filing of this report. On his part, Jawwad Rafique Malik, the federal Secretary of Industries, did not seem too worried and shared his views in an email. If his opinion conflicts with the PBS report, that, for sure, is another matter.
In his mailed note, he said: “There are various segments of industry, and hike in input costs and taxes will not necessarily hurt the industrial growth. For example, the export industry is still doing very well due to the demand spike. As a result, ginning, spinning, weaving, dyeing, printing, knitwear, garments, leather and sports goods are showing very healthy growth. 
“There is a slight dip in steel, cement and auto sectors, but they are likely to bounce back in the wake of huge domestic demand. Mobile phone manufacturing, urea, Diammonium phosphate and electronics production is good,” the email read.  
Many business leaders were anxious over the policy shift but were not too keen to share their views on record. Some with a soft corner for the PTI sounded somewhat delusional.
Musadiq Zulqarnain of Interloop was in high spirits. He said the shift in policy will have an impact, but the growth will still be there. “In the textile sectors, the factories are running to capacity. Many are expanding. Some have become functional and others will be so in the next two quarters”.
He attributed the fresh investment to TERF. “A major part (over 60pc) of investment is in textiles and apparel. Within the textile group, the major part is in spinning and weaving. 
“As such, theoretically, the exports will continue growing. The new challenge is now the availability of gas and the cost of energy.”
On LSM data, he said: “I am not sure. But there is a slight slowdown in construction and that might have depressed cement and steel. Also, high inflation and devaluation increased the prices of products and suppressed demand.” 
Nassar Hayat Magoon, President of the Federation of Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said growth in the manufacturing sector is contingent upon several factors. He was critical of the policy shift towards stabilisation that he thought will dissuade the investors.
Majyd Aziz, a renowned industrialist, sounded bitter. “It is not practical to keep on increasing production on a monthly basis when there are issues in the supply of raw material, infrastructure, working capital, etc. An uptick in interest rate, while discouraging, is not the only deterrent. Stable gas supply is a major concern that could reduce production and lead to missing shipment deadlines of exports.”
Ehsan Malik, the CEO of the Pakistan Business Council was rather soft. “The Monthly Quantum Index of Manufacturing for the first quarter of FY22 is above the same period for the last two years though it is lower than Jan 21 when it reached a peak as a result of various stimuli that were offered to revive demand and manufacturing.
“Looking ahead, inflation and devaluation are likely to curb domestic demand. The rising incidence of Covid-19 in Europe may also dampen demand for textiles. There are no quick fixes to revive the manufacturing sector. However, TERF-led capacity addition will help exports in particular, as substantial investment has gone into upgrading machinery to allow greater value addition,” he concluded.
