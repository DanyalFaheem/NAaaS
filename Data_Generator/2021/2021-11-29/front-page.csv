0,ECP orders forensic audit of video clips showing ‘vote buying’,Election official asks PML-N candidate to explain her position; rival parties level allegations against each other,"LAHORE: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has ordered a forensic audit of the video clips that went viral on social media in which loyalties of voters are reportedly being bought for Shaista Malik, a PML-N candidate for the by-poll in the National Assembly constituency of NA-133. 
Polling for the seat, which fell vacant after the death of Shaista’s husband Pervaiz Malik, is due on December 5. 
Returning Officer for NA-133 by-election Basit Ali has written to both the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority and the National Database and Registration Authority for a forensic audit of the videos to identify the people seen in the clips. 
The letter points out that long queues of people outside the places where the alleged vote-buying spree was going on and banners and portraits of the candidate can be spotted in the clips, whereas behind-the-scenes discussions recorded in the clips suggest that voters’ credentials are being noted for buying their votes against the payment of some cash. 

Election official asks PML-N candidate to explain her position; rival parties level allegations against each other

The returning officer has also asked the Punjab inspector general of police and Lahore commissioner to identify the people visible in the video clips and, after verification, initiate a strict legal action against them. Mr Ali also desires that the premises where the ‘vote-buying’ process was undertaken should be ascertained for a legal action. 
In his separate letters to the relevant authorities, the returning officer has asked them to submit by November 30 reports identifying and penalising the accused accordingly. 
The district monitoring officer has, meanwhile, issued a show-cause notice to Shaista Malik, directing her to explain on November 30 her position vis-à-vis purchasing of voters’ loyalties allegedly by her supporters. 
The issue has led to a social media war between the two rivals — the PML-N and the PPP — with allegations and counter-allegations against each other containing past conduct in the electoral bouts. 
The PML-N has rather approached the ECP against the PPP for allegedly purchasing loyalties of voters in the NA-133 by-poll. PML-N’s Arif Ismi submitted an application to the commission on Sunday along with video clips of alleged vote-buying activity by the PPP, alleging that the latter’s candidate Chaudhry Aslam Gill is involved in “corrupt and illegal practice of purchasing votes”. 
The application pointed out the main election office of Mr Gill on Peco Road as well as [a local PPP leader] Faisal Mir’s premises in Kot Lakhpat industrial area as the venues for offering Rs2,000 for each vote. 
Ali Pervaiz Malik, a PML-N MNA and son of Shaista Malik, took to his Twitter account to condemn what he called the ‘unholy business’ of purchasing votes by the PPP in NA-133 constituency. Hoping that the PPP leadership would take notice of the activity and put an end to the same, he claimed that the video clip involving PML-N workers in a similar activity was in fact a fabricated one being made viral on social media only as a counter strategy by the PPP. 
He recalled that his late father had secured 90,000 votes for the same seat in the 2018 general election, while Mr Gill could not bag even one-tenth of the figure then. 
On the other hand, Chaudhry Aslam Gill said the purchase of votes by the PML-N showed that it had mentally accepted its defeat against the PPP. Recalling the “politics of Chhanga Manga and Justice Qayyum’s audio leak” back in the 1990s, he said it was a routine tactic employed by the PML-N in each election. The PPP nominee said that such tactics of Nawaz Sharif had in fact made politics a pricier activity. 
The ruling PTI, whose candidate was knocked out of the contest on technical grounds, chided both the PML-N and the PPP for the tactics exposed in their respective video clips, saying that’s why the two opposition parties were against introduction of electronic voting machines, which could eliminate manipulation of the election results. 
“True face of the N-League stands exposed. In NA-133, women are being given cash in return for votes after taking oath on the Quran. That’s why they are against EVM machines,” PTI Senator Ejaz Chaudhary tweeted. 
Federal Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said at a public meeting in his hometown Jhelum that the talk of introducing voting machines had upset the PML-N and PPP the most. He asked if purchasing a vote for Rs2,000 was giving respect to the vote, a reference to the PML-N slogan.

1,President Alvi calls for steps to integrate ECO region,Says the region has all the elements needed for economic integration and rapid economic growth.,"• Sees Afghan peace imperative for TAPI gas pipeline, CASA-1000 electricity grid, trans-Afghan railway projects
• Holds bilateral talks with Uzbek, Turkish, Iranian, Azerbaijani and Tajik presidents    
ISLAMABAD: President Dr Arif Alvi has said the Economic Cooperation Organisation’s (ECO) member states, despite having all elements for economic growth, are among the least integrated in terms of trade and investment, stressing the need for unlocking their potential for growth and development. 
While speaking at the 15th Summit of the Heads of State of the ECO on Sunday, President Alvi said the intra-regional trade among ECO members was only eight per cent of their total trade though the region had all the elements needed for economic integration and rapid economic growth, including rich resources, enterprising people, geographical contiguity, and a common culture and heritage. 
Themed ‘Into the Future Together’, the summit was chaired by President of Turkmenistan Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov and attended by heads of ECO member states and Secretary-General Ambassador Khusrav Noziri. 
On the sidelines of the summit, the president, in separate meetings with several of his counterparts, reaffirmed resolve to boost bilateral cooperation. 
In his address at the summit, President Alvi said that in order to stay competitive, national and regional economies would have to move towards greater physical and virtual integration. Such integration was imperative for the ECO region, he reiterated, adding that the theme chosen for this summit was thus most apt and timely.
He called for ensuring the implementation of ECO Vision 2025, and the Islamabad Declaration, a free or preferential trade arrangement; strengthening of regional institutions such as the ECO Trade and Development Bank (ETDB) and operationalisation of the ECO Reinsurance Company (ERC). 
President Alvi, who reached Ashgabat on Saturday, called for advancing the transport corridors planned by the ECO under the Transit Transport Framework Agreement (TTFA). He welcomed the operationalisation of the Islamabad-Tehran-Istanbul road corridor.
Link to region’s prosperity
Calling peace in Afghanistan key to regional connectivity, he said the country after the end of a 40-year war was facing a humanitarian crisis, deepening liquidity crisis, with serious social and security implications. “We must all join hands in preventing such a disaster, which can revive chaos and conflict and the threat from terrorism in Afghanistan,” he said, adding that frozen assets of the country must be released to help alleviate sufferings of the Afghan people.  
Mr Alvi said stability in Afghanistan would also enable early implementation of agreed infrastructure and integration projects: the TAPI gas pipeline; the CASA 1000 electricity grid from Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan to Afghanistan and Pakistan; and construction of the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan railway line.
Recounting the economic impact of Covid-19 with disproportionate suffering of some ECO member states having a double-digit economic contraction, President Alvi said Pakistan had been relatively fortunate as the strategy of smart lockdowns, generous social protection and strategic economic stimulus saved lives and livelihoods. Mentioning the inflation triggered by Covid-related disruption in supply chains, he said the government was providing a massive package of targeted support to cushion the impact of inflation on the vulnerable sections of Pakistani population.
He said that in part, the global inflation in prices had been generated by the $27 trillion fiscal stimulus injected by the rich countries to revive their economies, as the developing countries had not been able to secure even a small fraction of the $4.3 trillion they needed to recover from the crisis.
Development agenda
The president called upon the ECO countries to join other developing countries in promoting a ‘common development agenda’ to return to the path of sustained and sustainable growth.
As the next chair of the Group of 77 and China, Pakistan will propose such a development agenda, including debt restructuring, redistribution of the new SDRs to developing countries, larger concessional financing, mobilisation of $100 billion in annual climate finance by the developed countries, ending the billions in illicit financial flows from the developing countries and the return of their stolen assets, and the creation of an equitable and open trading system and a fair international tax regime, he said.
He later invited ECO member states, also the OIC members, to attend the next OIC Foreign Ministers’ Conference in Islamabad on March 23, 2022. He emphasised the ECO’s contribution to reversing the rising tide of Islamophobia in Europe, North America and South Asia.
Pakistan relied on fraternal ECO and Islamic countries to support the exercise of the right to self-determination by the people of Jammu and Kashmir, they were in misery reeling under India’s illegal occupation and facing unspeakable oppression, he said.
Wishing success to Turkmenistan’s ECO chairmanship, the president said Pakistan looked forward equally to Uzbekistan as the next ECO chair.
Trans-Afghan railway project
Also on the sidelines of the ECO Summit, President Alvi held a bilateral meeting with his Uzbek counterpart Shavkat Mirziyoyev wherein he reaffirmed Pakistan’s full support for the Trans-Afghan railway project and assured all possible cooperation for its early realization.
While the talks covered the entire spectrum of bilateral cooperation, with a special focus on trade and economic ties as well as connectivity agenda, Mr Alvi underscored the significance of operationalising Uzbekistan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement. He also highlighted the need for immediate provision of humanitarian assistance for Afghanistan and de-freezing of its financial assets to avert an economic collapse in the country.
Both leaders agreed to work closely towards enhancing cooperation in regional and international fora.
Mr Alvi reiterated the invitation to President Mirziyoyev to visit Pakistan at his earliest convenience.
In a separate meeting on the sidelines of the summit, President Alvi and President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed to enhance not only bilateral trade and economic cooperation but also strengthen the ECO to achieve its objectives.
Mr Alvi appreciated Turkey’s principled stance on the issue of Kashmir and said there was a need to work together to tackle the challenges faced by the region.
The two leaders underlined the need for collective efforts of the region, particularly of the Islamic countries, to stop Islamophobia.
In his meeting with Iranian president Seyed Ebrahim Raisi, President Alvi thanked Iran’s consistent support to the Kashmir cause, particularly from the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei.
Mr Alvi also noted the increased convergence of views between the two countries on regional situation, particularly in the context of Afghanistan, and called for closely coordinated approach to achieve shared objectives of a peaceful, stable and prosperous Afghanistan.
President Alvi highlighted that Pakistan accorded highest priority to geo-economic prosperity and regional connectivity agenda. He underlined that Pakistan considered Iran as an important Muslim neighbour and brother based on deep-rooted historical, linguistic, religious and cultural linkages between the two countries. He underscored the importance of regular convening of bilateral mechanisms between Pakistan and Iran for trade and economy, also emphasizing the utilization of barter trade mechanism.
Shipments to Turkey
He expressed satisfaction at the recent operationalisation of International Road Transport (TIR) shipments from Pakistan to Turkey and Azerbaijan, which would be beneficial for the entire ECO region.
The two leaders expressed satisfaction on the regular high-level interactions, which had reinforced different avenues of bilateral cooperation. They agreed to stay engaged on all issues of mutual interest.
President Alvi earlier congratulated President Raisi on assuming the office after his victory in recent elections. He invited President Raisi to Pakistan at his earliest convenience.
President Alvi and his Tajik counterpart Emomali Rahmon in a meeting on the sidelines of the ECO summit reaffirmed commitment to continue joint efforts for further solidification of their close ties.
The two leaders expressed satisfaction on existing state of bilateral cooperation and reviewed state of implementation of CASA-1000 power transmission line project and resolved to its early completion.
Mr Alvi appreciated the momentum of high-level exchanges including the visit of Mr Rahmon to Pakistan in June 2021, followed by Prime Minister Imran Khan’s visit to Tajikistan in September. He highlighted prospects of regional integration and connectivity to Tajikistan and Central Asian countries through Pakistan’s seaports.
The two leaders discussed in detail the regional challenges faced by both Pakistan and Tajikistan due to deteriorating humanitarian situation in Afghanistan. Mr Alvi said the neighbouring countries would be affected the most from instability in Afghanistan and apprised Mr Rahmon of Pakistan’s efforts for peace and stability and to mobilise international support to avert humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan.
The de-freezing of Afghanistan’s financial assets was crucial in preventing economic collapse in the country, he said, while also underlined the imperatives of inclusiveness, respect for rights of all Afghans, and ensuring that Afghan territory was not used against any country.
President Alvi stressed the importance for both Pakistan and Tajikistan to work together to advance the shared objectives of peace and stability in Afghanistan. He observed that sustainable peace in Afghanistan would help unlock the vast trade and economic potential in the region.
In a separate meeting, President Alvi and President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev exchanged views on bilateral ties, trade and economic cooperation. The president also congratulated Mr Aliyev on the recovery of Azerbaijan’s territories from foreign occupation.
The two leaders agreed to further strengthen bilateral ties and cooperation at the regional and international forums.

2,Centre accuses Sindh of creating fake local govt system,"“The people of Sindh have been deceived again,” says Planning Minister Asad Umar while criticising a recent local govt bill.","KARACHI: Strained relations between the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf-led federal government and Pakistan Peoples Party-led Sindh government were dealt another blow when a key member of the federal cabinet on Sunday accused the provincial administration of deceiving people and vowed to launch a campaign against the recently passed Sindh Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2021. 
Situationer: New bill tightens Sindh govt’s control over local bodies
The announcement was made by federal Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Asad Umar, who also declared that the Centre couldn’t abandon the people of Sindh. 
He said: “This bill [Sindh Local Government Bill] doesn’t give powers to the local government of Karachi or any other city in the province. It has been floated to create a fake local government system. We reject this bill and now it’s time that we launch a campaign for the rights of Karachi and people of Sindh.” 
“The people of Sindh have been deceived again,” the federal minister said while addressing a workers’ convention of his party in North Nazimabad area. 
He referred to a petition filed by PTI in the Supreme Court for a system having effective, powerful and resourceful local bodies in the country and ‘appealed’ to the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Gulzar Ahmed to take it up on an urgent basis. 
“The overall (governance) system in Sindh isn’t based on justice. We have to make people of Sindh more powerful under the defined laws. Here in Karachi, the mayor isn’t supposed to run health and education system of the city. This is not fair and we can’t accept it,” asserted the federal minister. 
Only last week, the ruling party in Sindh got approved an amended local government bill that takes away functions of education and health care from municipal bodies and does away with open ballot for the election of mayors, deputy mayors amid opposition’s absence and based on PPP’s numeric majority in the Sindh Assembly. 
The new bill gives so much control to the provincial government over municipal organisations that it can effectively pull back their reins with just a notification without going through the cumbersome process of legislation. 
However, a strong reaction has come from the Centre, creating new challenges for the PPP-led Sindh government.  
“For Islamabad, we have brought a local bodies’ system that empowers the mayor for every single municipal, health and educational job in the capital,” said Mr Umar. 
“Here in Karachi we see the local bodies’ representatives cannot even take up the matter of water supply, sanitation and health. I say to my fellow members in Karachi that it’s a grave injustice with the city and they should stand against it with an effective campaign.” 
He also recalled that a number of projects had been launched in Karachi and other parts of Sindh by the federal government, accusing the PPP government of creating hurdles in execution and completion of those schemes for political gains. 
“The people of Karachi are suffering from injustice. They don’t ask for alms. They deserve better life, and strong and powerful local government system,” he added.

3,Riots erupt in Charsadda amid allegation of Quran desecration,CHARSADDA: Riots broke out in Tangi tehsil of Charsadda district after alleged burning of the Holy Quran at a mosque...,"CHARSADDA: Riots broke out in Tangi tehsil of Charsadda district after alleged burning of the Holy Quran at a mosque as protesters destroyed the area’s main police station, four posts and several residential quarters of police on Sunday. 
At least one man was injured after police resorted to firing in the air and teargas shelling to disperse an unruly mob that vandalised a police station. 
Witnesses said the enraged protesters broke into the compound of Mandani police station, set on fire at least 17 vehicles and motorcycles parked there and destroyed official record. Police vacated the station and escaped. 
Rescue 1122 personnel were called to extinguish the blaze. 
The protesters also took away the seized weapons from the police station. After torching the station, the frenzied mob set on fire a police post in the Dhaki area. They then proceeded to Ziam post of the Omarzai police station and also put it on fire. 
After ransacking the police station and the two posts, the mob torched Sha­koor post and Jamalabad post in the Mandani police station limits. 
The protesters were still camping outside the police station till late in the night and demanding that the accused be handed over to them. Eyewitnesses said police had completely failed to control the situation. 
Additional police personnel had to be called in from Nowshera and Mardan districts to quell the riots. 
Mandani circle DSP Ishaq told Dawn that the person who had allegedly torched the Holy Quran was apparently mentally deranged, adding that the accused was immediately taken into custody and shifted to an unknown location. “Apparently, the accused is mentally unstable and he cannot speak.” 
The news about the burning of the Holy Quran spread like jungle fire in the area and a large number of people encircled the police station. Local officials held talks with the protesters to pacify them, but the situation went out of control when the mob demanded handing over of the accused. 
Officials said the protesters broke the main gate of the police station and started damaging the property and record. Police resorted to firing in the air and teargas shelling to disperse the protesters, but could not control the situation. The personnel were forced to vacate the police station. 
DSP Ishaq said the protesters were demanding handing over of the accused. “Some were asking for summary execution of the accused.” 
Later, local leaders of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl staged a protest demonstration in Mandani bazaar and demanded punishment to the accused. Local people also held a rally in Dhaki bazaar in protest against the incident. 
Peshawar Commissioner Riaz Khan Mahsud told Dawn that elders and Ulema held talks with the protesters to defuse the situation, adding that the use of force against the protesters would be the last option. 
Police officials said the Mardan DIG and Charsadda DPO, along with additional forces from Nowshera and Mardan, held an emergency meeting at the Omarzai police station to make a strategy for controlling the situation.

4,Dhabeji Industrial Zone project hits snags,The SHC will take up a petition submitted to it challenging that the rules of SEZ were not followed in the award of the contract.,"• Award of contract challenged in Sindh High Court
• Provincial govt says project does not have SEZ status    
ISLAMABAD: The recently awarded contract for the Dhabeji Industrial Zone (DIZ) project that falls under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is in the doldrums after being challenged before a court of law. 
The Sindh High Court will take up on Monday (today) a petition submitted to it challenging that the rules of Special Economic Zones (SEZ) had not been followed in the award of the contract. 
The provincial government claims that since DIZ has not been given the status of SEZ so far, the rules of special economic zones do not apply to it. The CPEC Authority also had submitted an official statement to the high court, expressing satisfaction over the bidding process and claiming that no irregularity had been committed in the award of the contract. 
According to a document of the Sindh Economic Zones Management Company (SEZMC), however, the DIZ will be declared a special economic zone (SEZ). 
The multibillion DIZ, which will be developed under Public-Private Partnership by the successful bidder Zahir Khan & Brothers (ZKB) and the Sindh government, is part of CPEC and may be given the status of a special economic zone later. 
The project, spread over 1,500 acres, is being executed jointly by the Centre, Sindh government and CPEC Authority with an aim to make it a hub of major economic activities in the province. 
The Sindh government received bids for the project in February this year. However, after a two-month evaluation, one of the bids was declared ‘technically unfit’. The provincial government then went for re-bidding in which ZKB emerged successful. Subsequently, the government issued a Letter of Award (LoA) to the winning firm. 
However, the award of contract was challenged before the court that would take up the matter on Nov 29 (today). 
Earlier at a meeting held on Nov 23, Prime Minister Imran Khan expressed the hope that all economic zones, including Dhabeji Industrial Zone, would be completed at the earliest and economic activity started there. 
He, however, lashed out at the Sindh government for the slow pace of development work in the province. 
When contacted, Sindh government’s spokesman Saeed Ghani said he was not fully aware of the project’s details, but believed that there was nothing wrong in the award of the contract. 
Meanwhile, a senior SEZMC official said the provincial government had ensured transparency and fair play in the award as the successful bidder had quoted Rs16.25 billion while the second lowest bid was of Rs13.75bn. 
He said the total income to be generated from the project was Rs32bn and the successful bidder would have to pay Rs16bn to the provincial government in five to seven years. The remaining amount would be paid to the provincial government by selling plots in the economic zone, he added. 
The official believed that like 17 other industrial zones in the country, the DIZ had so far not attained the status of SEZ but the provincial government would apply for it later. 
“Allama Iqbal Economic Zone in Lahore was established in 2006 but got the SEZ status in 2016,” he said, explaining that economic zones did not get the SEZ status right away. 
The official said unfortunately the court had been misled by the petitioner, who was claiming that rules of SEZs had not been followed while awarding contract for DIZ. 
Meanwhile, it has been learnt that due to litigation, the DIZ project is being delayed as the successful bidder has still not signed the agreement with the Sindh government even a month after the issuance of the LoA. 
Under the contract, the successful firm will undertake designing, financing, construction, operation and maintenance of DIZ on a build, own, operate and transfer basis. 
The DIZ is located on the N-5 National Highway, close to Bin Qasim and Karachi ports as well as about 700km from Gwadar Port, which connects the Central Asia Republics, Middle East, Europe and Africa. According to the layout plan, the DIZ will have 130 heavy, 145 medium and 211 light industries, 82 warehouses, commercial area, office area, grid stations, roads, lanes, mosques, recreation areas, captive power generation facility and PTCL/SSGC/K-Electric intake points.
