Police said 19-year-old Asad, a student of Diploma of Associate Engineer, was on a motorcycle when a stray kite’s string entangled in his neck. The biker suffered critical injuries and after losing the balance fell on the road. He was taken to hospital where he succumbed to his injuries.
Police shifted the body to the morgue and registered a case against unidentified kite flyer(s).  
The victim’s father, Nisar Khan, blamed the government for his son’s death, saying it failed to control kite flying in the city, resulting in such tragic incidents.
Kite flying has been banned in Punjab for several years and any violation is punishable with imprisonment and fine, or both, under the law.
Chief Minister Usman Buzdar has expressed sorrow and grief on the death and sought a report from the capital city police officer.
He also ordered a thorough probe into the incident to fix the responsibility for failure to implement the ban on kite flying.  
Meanwhile, DIG operation Ahsan Younis also took notice of the incident and sought a report from Superintendent of Police (SP) concerned.
He urged the parents to play their role and stop their children from flying kites.
He said the station house officer (SHO) concerned would be responsible in case of any kite flying incident in his jurisdiction.
He directed the SPs to patrol their respective areas to check kite flying.

1,Punjab to approach Nepra for single phase net-metering,LAHORE: The Punjab government is set to approach the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) to allow...,"LAHORE: The Punjab government is set to approach the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) to allow generation licenses to those seeking  installation of solar net-metering system against single-phase  electricity meters.  
If the authority accepts the proposal, it  will allow power distribution companies (Discos) to process applications  from consumers and forward the same to the Nepra for issuance of  license.
“Since the net-metering is available for consumers  having three-phase meters, the Punjab government (energy  department) will soon send a detailed letter-cum-proposal to Nepra via  offices of the chief minister and chief secretary to also allow  net-metering to consumers having single-phase meters,” Energy  Department’s Director (Technical / Power) Muhammad Yasin told Dawn. 
The  solar net-metering allows domestic, commercial or industrial consumers  having three-phase meter connections to be part of the power generation  system by installing panels on his/her premises (house, shop, factory,  schools, govt departments, open spaces etc). Under the arrangement, such  a consumer may sell additional energy to respective power  distribution company (Disco).  
Since the system allows consumers to  generate electricity from 1KW to 1MW, the Nepra issues licences to applicants after the Disco s receive, scrutinise and process applications.
Mr Yasin  said the decision to take up the issue with Nepra was taken after the  energy department installed solar systems in 11,000 schools across the  province. Now, he said, the government wanted to extend the system to 2,500 Basic Health Units  (BHUs).  
He said most of the schools (80pc) had single phase  meters. “The need arose after we started thinking how to save and sell  solar energy of these schools to the national grid during summer and  winter vacations or after school hours.  
For this we  reached a consensus to have net-metering system in these schools having  single phase meters. But under the net-metering regulations-2015, only  those having three-phase meters can be given net-metering generation  licenses. That is why we have decided to take up the issue with Nepra,”  he explained.  
Mr Yasin said if Nepra approved the proposal, all consumers  having single phase meters across the country would become eligible to  apply for net-metering.  
To a question he said under the  regulations, net-metering license can be issued only for solar and wind  energy. “After having all schools on net-metering, we plan to introduce  this clean energy system to 2,500 BHUs to sell additional energy to the  national grid,” he said.

3,Lawyers question suspension of single bench proceedings by LHC CJ,The LHC chief justice had suspended the single bench proceedings which lawyers deem “unprecedented” and “beyond the rules”.,"LAHORE: In an interim order, which lawyers deem “unprecedented” and “beyond the rules”, the Lahore High Court chief justice has suspended the proceedings pending before another single bench at the Bahawalpur seat.
Senior Court Associate (BS-19) Muhammad Akmal Khan, who is often dubbed as a whistleblower, filed a writ petition at the Bahawalpur bench, challenging a final show-cause notice for removal from service, issued to him by the registrar. Mr Khan was posted at the regional bench when he filed the petition.
However, he was suspended and ordered to report at the principal seat in Lahore after Justice Anwarul Haq Pannu issued notice to the registrar office on his petition for Nov 24.
On the next date of hearing, Justice Pannu was informed by an additional registrar (judicial) that the proceedings before him had been suspended by the chief justice hearing a petition at the principal seat the same day.
Therefore, the judge adjourned the hearing for a date to be fixed by the office. The civil miscellaneous application taken up by the chief justice had a title “Lahore High Court through its registrar versus Muhammad Akmal Khan and others”.
The registrar requested the CJ to transfer the matter from Bahawalpur bench to the principal seat, citing great hardship of travelling for the respondent authorities of the LHC.
Chief Justice Muhammad Ameer Bhatti issued a notice to Mr Khan on the registrar’s application for Nov 30 and also stayed the proceedings pending at the Bahawalpur bench.
Talking to Dawn, Lahore High Court Bar Association’s president Maqsood Buttar said the chief justice and all the other judges of a high court enjoyed equal jurisdiction on the judicial side.
He said no single bench could suspend any proceedings pending before another single bench, adding it was unprecedented and against the rules of the high court.
Advocate Usama Khawar Ghumman said a chief justice of a high court was just primus inter pares (first among the equals). He did not carry more judicial authority than the junior most judge in the high court, he added.
He said there was no legal justification in staying the judicial proceedings pending before another single bench.
Mr Ghumman also stated the proceedings being conducted by the chief justice at the principal seat appeared to be administrative while the proceedings at the Bahawalpur were judicial in nature.
Constitutionally, administrative proceedings could not override judicial proceedings, he added.
The lawyer was of the opinion that more transparency and cautiousness was required to deal with the internal matters of the judiciary as the courts were the last resort for people to get justice.
He said in the past the Islamabad High Court was also hit by a controversy of illegal appointments and promotions and there was a Supreme Court judgment in the matter.
Advocate Zawar Ahmad Sheikh, who represented the LHC registrar, refused to make any comment on the proceedings suspended by the chief justice, saying as the matter was still sub-judice, he would not speak on it.
The final show-cause notice issued to Akmal Khan carries no allegation of any malpractice, but accuses him of filing a plethora of applications showing his anti-authority, anti-institutional and anti-establishment campaign. He is also accused of willful disobedience.
Mr Khan was denied certified copies of the charges on the pretext that each and every charge had been taken from his repeated applications of misconduct. The office has already submitted an interim reply to the show-cause notice questioning its legality.
A writ petition filed by Mr Khan in 2017 against out-of-turn promotions in the LHC is still pending with the court.
A former chief justice had admitted this petition for regular hearing and directed the registrar to submit a list of employees benefited under rule 26 of the high court establishment rules, in any manner, including employment, deputation, promotion or post upgrade.
An internal audit was also ordered by then chief justice on a complaint of Mr Khan alleging embezzlement in the LHC employee’s welfare fund.

5,punjab notes: A small matsya [fish] is our Noah’s Ark,"Each culture takes pride in its apparent exclusivity; what fundamentally important it has, it believes, is not ...","Each culture takes pride in its apparent exclusivity; what fundamentally important it has, it believes, is not shared by other cultures which are different or hostile. It invariably tends to treat its repertoire of religious notions and cultural practices as unique, created solely by it for its members.  
A particular vision is thought to be endogamous to a particular society. Such an attitude is either a product of arrogance or ignorance or both. The historical fact is that no society is complete in itself. Each society is actually a twisted skein of diverse threads. Firstly, it’s so because each society inevitably develops driven by interaction with others, however subtle it may be.  
Development in the sense of reaching a point forward underpinned by something fresh involves a process of borrowing or give and take. Secondly, the great driving force in all societies is undeniably human mind. Human mind, wherever it is, has certain ways of thinking and imagining beyond the perimeters constructed by specific culture.  
Karl Marx says that what distinguished man from animals is his ability to construct a plan in imagination which he can realise in future. Such an ability can also conjure up the past though it may be in a mythopoeic form. Working of human mind is characterised by certain patterns which have been found to be universal.  
One doesn’t need to be Carl Yung or Levi-Strauss in order to discover such phenomena these days.
It has been noted that in the course of human evolution, there are certain happenings which being milestones of phenomenal significance are etched in our collective memory though expressed differently in a specific way by each society. One such happening is the legend of deluge found in different regions separated by geography. This experience or imagined experience of the legend of the deluge is universally found in all civilisations as its origins are buried deep in the haze of distant past, in the primordial times perhaps. The variants of this myth for example are found in Assyrian, Palestinian, Arabian, Chinese, Greek, Norse and Indian mythologies. The legend points to an apocalyptic change in climate that threatened universal annihilation. Sadly, in our Muslim dominated society which is fast becoming narrow-minded and myopic, at best we refuse to accept what we share with other societies and at worst reject it as trash.  
If you ask people here about the legend of the deluge, informed among them would refer to Noah’s Ark as it’s found in the Quran. But few know the flood story found in our ancient indigenous literature which we have discarded as something not only alien but misleading.  
We happily suffer from the fallacy that by changing our faith, we can change our past spread over thousands of years. Here is the legend as found in Shtapatha-brahmanain which the protagonist is Manu, the patriarch of the tribes led by Indra into Saptasindhus, the lands of seven rivers: in the morning they brought water for Manu so that he could wash his hands. While he was washing a fish came into his hands. The fish said that if he saved and reared her, she would save him. “What you would save me from”, asked Manu. “A flood will sweep away all the creatures. I will save you from it”. “How can I rear you”?“As long as I am small, there is a great danger of destruction; fish eat fish. Dig a pit and keep me there. When I grow too big for it, take me to the sea because then I shall be safe from destruction”.  
Soon the fish grew big and said; “there will be that flood in such and such year. You shall pay me heed and construct a ship. When the flood rises, you shall enter the ship. And I will save you from the flood”.  
After having reared it, he took the fish to the sea. In the same year the fish had told him, he prepared the ship. When flood rose, he entered the ship. The fish swam towards him and it tied the rope of the ship to its horn. In this way he was taken to the northern mountain over there. Then fish spoke; “I saved you. Tie your ship to a tree. Don not allow the water to cut you off as long as you are on the mountain. You may come down as the water gradually recedes”. The flood swept away all the creatures. Manu alone stayed there. He practiced austerities desiring offspring. He performed a sacrifice while in the water; he offered clarified butter, curd, sour milk and whey. In a year there emerged a woman, quite sturdy with clarified butter gathered in her foot marks. She met Manu and told him that she was his daughter born of his sacrifice in the water. She was the benediction, she said. Through her the race of Manu was able to survive. In this story of survival in apocalyptic times the fish was an avatar of the Lord Vishnu. A variation of this legend is also found in Mahabharata. “In essence the legends of Mahabharata and Shatpatha-brahmana are the same. Neither of them makes any mention of Aryas or aindras [Indra-led tribes] in particular, which means that probably it was a legend, not particularly belonging to Arya heritage’, comments Malti J.Shendge in her book The Aryas: Facts without Fancy and Fiction.  
The legend bears striking similarity to Biblical/ Quranic story and Manu to Noah. Both survived deluge that washed away everything. Both ensured the survival of mankind. Similar flood stories are found in Sumerian and Akkadian mythologies. All this proves that thinking patterns of human mind are the same all over the planet and that humans have faced threats of universal annihilation in the past as they do in the present. Such previous threats were mostly natural and the present ones are mostly man made. The main reason is that diverse groups fear one another as each has amassed power of mass destruction with the advance in technology.  
Secondly, these groups, separated by distances, faiths and worldviews, think out of their ignorance born prejudices that they share less with others that they actually do. Eons old myths and legends show us, if our contemporary expanded consciousness doesn’t, that we humans share the same destiny regardless of particularities of each human group. — soofi01@hotmail.com

The government has issued the orders in the wake of the tragedy of three schoolchildren’s death after they were run over by a trailer on Karachi-Lahore-Peshawar (KLP) highway near here on Friday. Muhammad Farhan, 16, Kiran, 10, and Aliza, 15, were knocked down by the speeding vehicle when they were crossing the road after school closure time.  
The authorities took notice of the incident and the administration sealed Al-Saleem School and registered a case against owner Arshad Saleem over negligence. Chief Minister Usman Buzdar expressed sympathy with the parents over the loss of the lives of the children and sought a report from the officials concerned. 
A source told Dawn that the government had ordered security audit of all the public and private schools and measures to ensure safety of schoolchildren. Installation of CCTV cameras, construction of overhead bridges and availability of well-equipped private security guards for schools would be ensured, the source said.  
In addition, he said, the government had instructed the schools to install walk-through gates and barbed /razor wires at the boundary walls. He said letters had been issued to the regional and divisional heads to submit their reports.  
Scores of private schools function along Karachi-Bahawalpur and Bahawalnagar-Bahawalpur national highways but none of these has overhead bridges to facilitate the children and employees in crossing the road.  
District Education Authority Chief Executive Officer Zahoor Chohan says he has submitted a detailed report to the higher authorities. He is quoted as having said the teachers have been asked to ensure that the schools remain open till the exit of the last student.

9,‘US deliberately ignoring minorities oppression in India’,LAHORE: A representative meeting of leaders of various religions and different schools of thought rejected here on...,"LAHORE: A representative meeting of leaders of various religions and different schools of thought rejected here on Sunday the US decision to include Pakistan among the countries where religious freedoms are a matter of concern.
Societal matters of personal nature could not be associated with religion as minorities in Pakistan are safer and freer than any other country, said the inter-faith meeting chaired by PM’s aide on religious harmony Hafiz Tahir Ashrafi here on Sunday.
It said that over 200 churches and 150 mosques have been demolished, while more than 50 Christian leaders have been murdered in India but America conveniently overlooked all this oppression of minorities.
The meeting was attended by Hindu leader Bhagat Lal, Sikh leader Sardar Sikandar Singh, Pastor Emanuel Khokhar, Maulana Muhammad Ali Naqshbandi, Sohail Raza, Maulana Muhammad Aslam Qadri, Maulana Aslam Siddiqui, Hafiz Noman, Maulana Rehmat Din, Maulana Mufti Wasim, Maulana Abdul Jabbar, and Qari Kifayatullah.
They said at a joint press conference after the meeting that there’s no concept of forced marriage and forced conversion in Islam and a 20-member committee was constituted to resolve complaints in this regard. They claimed that over 130 complaints from minorities of these natures had been addressed in the year 2020-21.
They urged NGOs working in the name of minority rights to bring all complaints to the notice of the government and alleged that the campaign on account of religious freedoms against Pakistan was politically motivated.
The leadership stated that it seems strange that NGOs and organizations go to the embassies in Islamabad but are not ready to sit with the government for resolving the issues if any.
Hafiz Ashrafi said that he would like to re-invite them through the media to come forward and work together for resolving the problems.
“But, if these aim at only doing propaganda then God willing the leadership of all the religions has decided that in the first phase we are going to the religious leaders and in the next phase we will also go to the public [to clarify the situation].”
Hafiz Ashrafi said that a suggestion was under consideration for educating particularly the non-Muslim youth on blasphemy and Namoose-e-Risalat issues so the problems were solved through dialogue.
He said through unity and harmony, they had already settled many controversial issues peacefully and would continue to do so in future.

A  meeting, chaired by Secretary Information and Culture Raja Jahangir,  was held at Pilac some days ago for finalising the details of these  projects, sources said. 
They added that all three projects were initiatives of secretary culture.  
It  is also learnt that in the near future, Pilac is also planning to form a  dance ensemble for cultural dances of Punjab for which the dancers  would be hired on monthly wages to perform at different functions and during the visits of dignitaries. 
Talking about the projects,  Pilac Director General Dr Sughra Sadaf said the new projects would be instrumental in promoting the rich culture and heritage of Punjab.
She added the culture of Punjab would be portrayed through the transmission of the Punjab Rung Satellite Television and the artists, artisans, folk musicians, traditions, cultural norms, customs, local games,  literature, folklore and Sufism would be projected through it.
She said the proposed TV channel would be the first one in the culture sector to be launched under the government and it would be set up at Pilac under the auspices of the Information and Culture Department Punjab.  
The existing available space at Pilac would be used to set up the studios;  however, the space for offices of allied staff would be required while the television licence matter was in process, she added. 
According to sources, preservation of village life and culture of Punjab would be the principal objectives of the projects and sufficient space was available at Pilac to develop a village scene.
The village would consist of mud houses, courtyards, a cooking area, pottery, a Persian wheel and other village scenes. Proper designing and placement of village scenes would be carried out. The artisans would be selected to make dioramas and lasting material would be used to make them. 
The Punjab crafts bazaar would be used to promote the culture of the province. Under the project, about eight shops would be built at the boundary wall between Pilac and Alhamra Cultural Complex near Gaddafi Stadium.
The shops would sell handicrafts, pottery, cultural dresses,  cloth, antiques, ornaments, woodworks, musical instruments and cuisine. The bazaar would also be a source of revenue generation as well.

12,Call for making SNC more inclusive,"MULTAN: The speakers at a booklet launching ceremony termed the Single National Curriculum (SNC) chaotic,...","MULTAN: The speakers at a booklet launching ceremony termed the Single National Curriculum (SNC) chaotic, self-contradictory and misleading, suggesting its review to make it more inclusive and discrimination-free.  
Addressing the launching ceremony of the booklet ‘Single National Curriculum: Critical Analysis and Policy Recommendation’, known educationist and head of the Institute of Development Research and Corresponding Capabilities (IDRAC) Amjad Nazir said adequate budgeting, new schools, provision of missing facilities, availability of teachers and modern learning aids were far more important for education in the country than enforcing the so-called SNC.
“Since day one, the government itself has been juggling with the SNC and Uniform System of Education, failing to deliver on any of the fronts in letter and spirit. With Sindh already refusing to implement it and Balochistan’s meaningful silence – the SNC has already ceases to be ‘national’. Although the federal and provincial governments have allowed privates publishers to print their own books, there are multiple glitches in between, such as delays in issuance of NOC, the associated fee and private schools continuing with their own education sessions and system,” Mr Nazir said. He also expressed his reservations regarding authorising the Muttahida Ulema Board (MUB) in Punjab to also assess syllabus of social sciences as well. 
Criticising Punjab government for allowing private schools to continue with their own curriculum, he said, “If that is the case, then what has been the whole fuss about.”  
Pointing out the confusion with regard to SNC’s implementation in madressahs (seminaries), he said, “Hardly 10 percent of the madressahs will be having a formal system of schooling. The rest will focus only on their conventional tajveed, naazra, hifz and hadeeth. Even that small fraction (10pc) has sought 4-5 years to adopt the SNC, besides demanding teachers, their salaries, employment of their students etc”.  
Sharing the statistics from the primary research on a small sample, comprising 32 public, 28 private schools and 18 madressahs in Punjab and Sindh, he concluded that only 52pc of the private schools teachers were familiar with the SNC; in private sector only 27pc of teachers had heard about the SNC while, the ration was only 20pc in madressahs.  
In the government schools, around 68pc of teachers had received online or physical training to teach the SNC, while the ration was 19pc in the private schools.  
Likewise, he said, around 68pc of the public schools had received grade I-V model SNC textbooks, only 21pc of the private schools purchased the books, an only 5pc of madressahs (following the formal education system) had receive the said textbooks. 
As per the study, about 58pc of the public schools believed that the new textbooks were gender equal, while of the madressahs that responded 15pc did not agree to the idea. 
“Around 91pc of public schools teachers agreed that minorities were equally represented in schools, 9 percent private schools affirmed it, while it was irrelevant for madressahs as no non-Muslims were studying there.  
Pakistan Minority Teachers Association (MTA) president Anjum J Paul, appreciated the government for first time granting the non-Muslims the right to formally study their own faith instead of ‘Ethics’. 
“But at the same time, it (the government ) is violating the right of the Christians, Hindus,  
Sikhs, Bahais and Kalasa minorities by incorporating sufficient Islamic content in compulsory social sciences subjects such as Urdu, English and others. It was tantamount to instructing minorities’ in faith other than their own and undermined their rights as prescribed in Article 22 (1) [of the constitution] stating that no person shall be instructed or propagated, directly or indirectly - any faith other than his own,” he said. 
Mr Paul was of the view that additional marks for learning the Holy Quran by heart, would systematically excluded the non-Muslim students, suggesting inclusion of Islamic content in the subject of Islamiyat only to remove “systematic discrimination from education”. 
Dr Amjad Bukhari said that despite certain problems, most of the SNC content could be appreciated for having features like inbuilt exercises, gender balance, removal of hatred or socio-religious biases and accommodating social, cultural, environmental and human rights. Poet Qamar Raza Shehzad also spoke.  
The seminar ended with a question- answer session moderated by Zahoor Joya.

Police said Misbah and her daughter-in-law were going home after shopping in a nearby market when two gunmen stopped them on the street. They tried to snatch the cash and jewellery at which the woman resisted. The gunmen shot at and injured Misbah and fled the scene.
The woman was taken to a nearby hospital where she was pronounced dead after some hours of treatment. 
Police shifted the body to a morgue for autopsy and later registered a robbery and murder case against the two unidentified robbers on the complaint of the deceased’s son, Waqas.
The police said the investigation of the case was started and they were collecting evidence to identify the robbers.
