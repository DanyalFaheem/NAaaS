0,Doctors observe black day today to demand specialisation training,"Officials say all 1,450 candidates can’t be accommodated as there are only 875 seats","PESHAWAR: The doctors announced to observe black day on Monday and Tuesday in hospitals against non-induction of all medics for part II specialisation training as the government wanted them to take up other specialities than medicines and allied specialities where seats weren’t available to accommodate all the applicants.
The postgraduate medical institute (PGMI) inducts trainee medical officers (TMOs) in January and July. The selected candidates are deployed in hospitals on the basis of available seats approved by College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan (CPSP) on the basis of number of supervisors.
Dr Asfandyar Bittani, provincial president of Young Doctors Association, told Dawn that PGMI should induct all the applicants for training while the health department officials said that they could not induct all the 1,450 candidates because the number of seats was 875.

Officials say all 1,450 candidates can’t be accommodated as there are only 875 seats

“In the past, the government would send TMOs to other provinces and they were given stipend by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government. We need more specialists in medicines and allied specialities because there is extreme shortage in the province,” said Dr Asfandyar.
He said that YDA called off its sit-in after three days on Saturday, hoping that their demand would be met. “We would observe black day on Monday and Tuesday in the province. If the government does not move, then we will consider complete strike because it is a matter of future of doctors,” he said. He added that there is no proper policy about induction of trainee medical officers.
Health department, which is dealing with policy matters regarding the training of doctors, is averse to accept the demand of doctors to induct them all. 
“The government is giving Rs80,000 per month during training to each TMO. Previously, they were sent to other provinces while stipend was given by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa but that policy did not work because we did not have to appoint so many specialists in medicine and allied specialities,” senior health officials told this scribe.
They said that there were only 275 available seats for TMOs while applicants numbered 700. “We suggest that they should take up other specialities like, anaesthesia, radiology, psychiatry, eye, ear nose and throat (ENT), pulmonology, nephrology, gastroenterology, cardiac surgery, etc as these specialities are desperately needed by people of the province,” they added.
The officials said that CPSP offered postgraduate training in 75 specialities but most doctors wanted specialisation in medicines and allied specialities.
Dr Mudassar Afridi of Provincial Doctor Association said that although different criteria were followed across the country for inducting doctors, who wanted to be trained as specialists, they all had to take the FCPS Part-I examination.
Currently in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, doctors have to undergo an additional test conducted by Educational Testing and Evaluation Agency (Etea) that gets the biggest say in whether they will get their desired specialty or not. Additional criteria are also applied which seem to be fluid and ever-changing. “However, a definitive mechanism for ensuring optimum quality and quantity still remains to be designed and implemented,” said Dr Mudassar.
Prof Mohammad Arif Khan, the chief executive officer of PGMI, told Dawn that it was a policy matter to be decided by the government. “We have been holding webinars from time to time to convince the medics to go for the specialities, which are scarce and needed by the people,” he said. 
He said that the province required doctors in 22 specialities. “The introduction of Etea has helped us because previously medical graduates from China, Russia and Afghanistan used to get many of training slots because of their higher marks but now 75 per cent marks are allocated to Eta test, 20 per cent to undergraduate and five per cent per cent to services periphery,” he added.
The doctors agreed with Dr Arif and said that it was purely on merit. In past merit was made on the basis of MBBs marks, then question was raised about discrepancies in private, foreign graduates and public sector marks, so the PGMI introduced its own test through Etea for induction and there was lesser chances of merit violation in it.

By organising the vintage car rallies, the Heritage Motoring Club of Pakistan wants to promote the hobby among the enthusiasts both locally and internationally. The club hopes the government allows this hobby to grow by allowing classic cars’ imports and ensuring foreigners’ participation.

3,ANP asks centre to release KP’s net hydel profit,Hoti says govt failed to provide relief to people,"PESHAWAR: Awami National Party has accused the federal government of using delaying tactics to release to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa its pending dues of net hydel profit and natural gas royalty amounting to billions of rupees, which could be used for initiation of development projects in the province. 
Addressing a workers convention in Chamkani here on Sunday, the ANP central senior vice-president Ameer Haider Khan Hoti said that Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf had been in power in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for the past eight years, but it had failed to raise voice for its share in the national resources. 
Several other ANP leaders, including Haji Ghulam Ahmad Bilour, Senator Haji Hidayatullah Khan, MPA Shagufta Malik, Saqibullah Khan Chamkani, Arbab Usman Khan and Arbab Umer Khan, also shared their views on the occasion, according to a party statement. 

Hoti says govt failed to provide relief to people

Mr Hoti said that Prime Minister Imran Khan had made tall claims to provide 10 million jobs to the people and shelter to five million in different provinces, but he failed to fulfil his commitment. 
He expressed his concern over increasing prices of essential commodities and said the PTI government was unable to devise an effective economic plan to provide financial relief to the people. He said the unprecedented increase in the prices of sugar, ghee, flour, natural gas and electricity had multiplied problems for the poor who were unable to meet their routine expenditures. 
Mr Hoti said it was duty of the provincial government to raise voice for release of the pending funds at least to launch uplift schemes in the province. He said the rulers had no right to stay in power any longer. 
He recalled that it was the ANP government in 2008 which offered sacrifices in the war on terrorism for restoration of durable peace and made hectic efforts for provision of facilities in education, health, road infrastructure and other sectors. 
The ANP leader said his party had established quality public sector universities in different districts to promote higher education besides making efforts for provincial autonomy. He claimed that his party would win the upcoming local government elections in the province.

PTI TO FACE DEFEAT IN LG POLLS: Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz MNA Mohammad Sajjad Awan insists if his party joins hands with Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl in the local body elections they can easily defeat the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

10,Saifullahs’ alliance with PTI under threat ahead of LG polls in Lakki Marwat,"Forged before the 2018 polls, the alliance had helped the ruling PTI to grab one seat of MPA from the southern district.","LAKKI MARWAT: The alliance between influential Saifullahs and the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf is in the doldrums as both have fielded candidates for the seats of chairman in Lakki Marwat and Ghaznikhel tehsils of the district. 
Forged before the 2018 general elections, the alliance had helped the ruling party to grab one seat of MPA from the southern district. 
Hisham Inamullah, a close relative of Saifullah brothers who had won the election as MPA, was initially appointed minister for health and then for social welfare. In July, the government de-notified him as minister. 
Sources said the party leadership ignored Mr Inamullah and awarded tickets to those aspirants recommended by district president Johar Mohammad. 

Both have fielded candidates for key tehsil slots 

They said that Saifullah brothers, who are allies of the ruling party, were also not consulted before distribution of the tickets. Mr Hisham took notice of it and wrote letters to the prime minister, KP chief minister, PTI general secretary Aamir Mehmood, chief organiser Saifullah Khan Niazi and south region president Shahbaz Shinwari. 
He alleged that federal minister Ali Amin Gandapur awarded tickets to the candidates in Lakki Marwat in cahoots with his handpicked district president Johar Mohammad. 
He proposed the names of Shafqatullah, Zeeshan Mohammad and Ashfaq Khan to the party leadership to award them tickets for the chairman slots in Lakki Marwat and Ghaznikhel tehsils and Betani tribal subdivision. However, the party high command did not pay heed to his proposal. The PTI workers are now in a fix whom to support; the candidates backed by the party or those affiliated with Saifullahs and Mr Inamullah. 
In Lakki Marwat, PTI district general secretary Shafqatullah Khan backed by Saifullah brothers and MPA Hisham is in the poll arena as an independent candidate while the party fielded its tehsil president Mohammad Iqbal for the slot of tehsil chairman. 
An independent candidate Zeeshan, a close relative of Saifullahs, will confront PTI aspirant Mohammad Salim for Ghaznikhel tehsil chairman slot. 
Similarly, Noor Gul, a PTI contender, will give a tough time to an independent candidate Ashfaq Khan, backed by Saifullahs and Mr Hisham, for Betanni tribal subdivision top slot.

12,Political parties finalise strategy to win maximum seats in tehsil councils,Allot tickets to their candidates against one of three general councillor seats to avoid votes’ rejection,"PESHAWAR: The political parties in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have allotted tickets to their candidates against one of the three general councillor seats in each village and neighbourhood councils to avoid confusion and minimise the possibility of votes’ rejection in the upcoming local government elections.
By allotting one ticket instead of three in each village and neighbourhood council, the political parties are eyeing the slot of chairman, who will also be a member of tehsil council by virtue of office.
According to the Local Government Act, 2013, each council of village and neighbourhood consists of seven seats including three general seats and one seat each for women, peasant/worker, youth and minority.
As per law, of the three winning candidates on the general seats, the one, who has maximum votes, will be declared chairman of the relevant village and neighbourhood council (VCNC), while the remaining two successful candidates will be just councillors.
The Election Commission of Pakistan is ready to conduct local bodies’ elections in 17 districts of the province on December19. 

Allot tickets to their candidates against one of three general councillor seats to avoid votes’ rejection

The ECP had announced to conduct the elections at village and neighbourhood council level on non-party basis, while at tehsil level on party basis, as per the KP LG Act, 2013. 
However, Peshawar High Court directed ECP to hold local bodies’ elections at both the tiers on party basis.
“Since the VCNC chairman would also be a member of tehsil council, so the party has focused on getting maximum slots of the chairman to have sufficient representation in the tehsil council and VCNC,” Mohammad Zahid, a local leader of Awami National Party, told Dawn.
He said that a ballot paper would carry three symbols of the same party if a political party awarded tickets to three candidates on the three general seats. 
In such a scenario, he said, the party workers would poll votes to all three candidates of the party instead of one, while a voter could poll vote for one general seat only.
“The votes would go wasted if the electorates poll votes to more than one candidates on general seats,” he said, adding that majority of the voters were not properly educated about how to cost votes, especially in the rural areas.
Mr Zahid said that similarly, the party’s votes would be divided into three if a party allowed its workers to contest for all the three general seats. 
He added that in such a situation the party might lose the slot of chairman of the VCNC and resultantly the membership of the respective tehsil council.
Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl provincial information secretary Haji Jalil Jan told this scribe that if three tickets were awarded to party workers then they would not only be in competition with the candidates of other political parties but also with their own party’s candidates.
He said that election campaign would also be difficult for the political parties as the leadership would be puzzled during the drive to ask the voters to cast vote for a candidate of the party out the three.
Jamaat-i-Islami provincial secretary information Mohammad Iqbal said that there were high possibilities of wasting of votes if the political parties contested poll for all the three general seats in a VCNC.
A senior leader of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf told Dawn that the party allotted one ticket to a single candidate in majority of the councils. 
While in some areas where more than one workers of a party were aspirants and the party was unable to decide among them, the party asked them to contest elections as independent candidates, he added.
He said that if the party awarded ticket to two or three candidates then they would be losers as the voters would poll votes to all of them instead of one that would be rejected.
It is pertinent to mention here that in the first phase, elections would be held in 17 districts including Peshawar, Nowshera, Charsadda, Khyber, Mohmand, Mardan, Swabi, Bajaur, Haripur, Kohat, Karak, Hangu, Bannu, Lakki Marwat, Dera Ismail Khan, Tank and Malakand.

A knowledgeable source told Dawn that Rs2 billion allocated by the federal government for construction of the varsity building in 2018 remained unutilised as the provincial government had failed to fulfill its responsibly of providing land.
He said the Planning Commission had given a last chance to the provincial government to either provide land or surrender the amount to the federal government as such an amount cannot be used for any other purpose in the province.
He said the paucity of funds was the main obstacle to acquiring 400 kanals of land for which Rs1.8 billion was required, while the provincial government’s allocation for the purpose for the current fiscal was only Rs50 million.
The source said the Malakand division commissioner had convened the meeting of the special committee, also comprising the elected representatives, which selected the site along the Garam Chashma Road near the Chitral city.
The source said after deliberations, the committee decided to choose Seen Lusht village for the establishment of the main campus of the university, while a sub-campus would be established in Upper Chitral.
“The land acquired in Syed Abad (Ispagh Lusht) some years ago was not considered for the purpose on the grounds that it was only 166 kanals against the required area of 400 kanals, while the site had also been declared unfeasible geologically,” he said.
He added the meeting decided to return the present building of the university back to the technical education department, which had constructed it in 2009 for establishment of a polytechnic institute. 
However, the then Awami National Party government had opened the Chitral campus of the Abdul Wali Khan University Mardan there.
Lower Chitral deputy commissioner Hassan Abid confirmed the selection of the site for the university campus at Seen Lusht and said the Rs50 million allocated for the purpose would be utilised to purchase land.
