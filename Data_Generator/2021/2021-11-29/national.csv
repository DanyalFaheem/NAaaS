2,PTI issues notice to Riaz Fatyana for ‘vilifying’ two cabinet members,"MNA blamed for making ""unreasonable"" demands at Glasgow conference and ""false"" accusations against two members of cabinet.","ISLAMABAD: The ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has issued a show-cause notice to its MNA Riaz Fatyana for allegedly making “unreasonable” demands at the recently held climate conference in Glasgow (UK) and making “false” allegations against two members of the federal cabinet. 
The notice was issued to the MNA from Toba Tek Singh by the PTI’s Standing Commi­ttee on Accountability and Disci­pline (SCAD) on the complaint of Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam days after Mr Fatyana alleged that the former had a brawl with Minister of State for Climate Change Zartaj Gul while attending the conference in the UK. 
Mr Fatyana made the allegations during a meeting of the parliament’s Public Accounts Committee on November 25, which were widely covered by the mainstream and social media. 

MNA blamed for making ‘unreasonable’ demands at Glasgow conference and ‘false’ accusations against two members of cabinet

He had alleged that both Mr Aslam and Ms Gul had gotten into a brawl that even compromised Pakistan’s position at the United Nations Conference on Climate Change. 
The PTI MNA has been asked to submit a written statement on or before December 4 along with relevant documents and evidence. “You have to show cause as to why we should not proceed against you. The nature of this disciplinary proceeding shall be inquisitorial,” said the notice issued to Mr Fatyana by the SCAD. 
The committee has offered Mr Fatyana that he can request the committee in his written response to be heard in person to elaborate on his written defence, while failing to respond by the given date, “the committee could proceed ex-parte”. 
“Upon your return, as a member of the Public Accounts Committee, you have made some absurd and totally fabricated and false assertions in the meeting held on November 25, including that there was a brawl between two senior officials and Zartaj Gul which led to her leaving the conference early, whereas she had left early only to attend the joint session [of parliament],” reads the show-cause notice, a copy of which is available with Dawn, while quoting from the complaint filed by Mr Aslam. 
“This false news was taken up by the media and caused irreparable damage to the personal reputation of the complainant, the party’s image as well as performance of Pakistan at the COP which got national as well as global acclaim,” said the notice.
In his complaint, Mr Malik alleged that Mr Fatyana had come to Glasgow to attend the conference on climate change funded by an NGO and visited the Pakistani pavilion a couple of times where he made some “unreasonable demands” such as becoming a part of the official delegation, which needed the prime minister’s approval. 
Mr Aslam also alleged in this complaint to the SCAD that Mr Fatyana had demanded an official vehicle and phone SIMs for his use, “but these could, obviously, not be met as he was not part of official country delegation”. 
On Saturday, Mr Aslam and Ms Gul had issued a joint statement denying any brawl or misunderstanding at COP-26 and termed the allegations made by Riaz Fatyana “baseless”. 
“It is added that Riaz Fatyana was not a part of Pakistan’s official delegation and was representing a non-governmental organisation without any invitation of the Ministry of Climate Change,” said the statement. 
Despite repeated attempts, Mr Fatyana could not be contacted for his comments.

4,Senator wants probe into plane controversy,A PIA spokesman declares that there is no truth in the reports that a Boeing aircraft has been rendered useless.,"ISLAMABAD: The controversy over the grounding of a Boeing aircraft by Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) after it was damaged during an anti-hijacking drill by the law enforcement agencies is likely to face a parliamentary scrutiny, as an opposition senator belonging to the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) on Sunday declared he would raise the matter before the parliamentary committee concerned.
Talking to Dawn, PML-N Senator Afnanullah Khan said he had already asked Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Aviation Hidayatullah to take up the matter for investigation and he would formally write a letter to him in this regard.
Senator Khan said he would explain through the letter the issue to the committee chairman, requesting him to summon the high-ups of PIA and the Airport Security Force (ASF). He said the opposition members in the committee would also request for a subcommittee to hold a thorough investigation. 
The PML-N senator said PIA’s Boeing 777-200 LR with registration number AP-BGL had been parked at a storage facility in Karachi for almost two years. The aircraft that cost over $300 million to the national exchequer had not been able to fly due to the damage caused during the drill by the law enforcement agencies when an ASF truck had hit it with full force, he added. 
Mr Khan said the PIA management had initially denied any “wrongdoing” but later confirmed the drill and that the plane had been damaged. 
Last month, a recently retired PIA pilot, Mumtaz Hussain, had filed a petition in the Lahore High Court on the matter. On October 25, Justice Tariq Nadeem directed the deputy attorney general “to procure a reply and para-wise comments from the PIA chief executive officer”. 
The next date of case hearing is November 30 (tomorrow). 
In his petition filed under Article 199 of the Constitution, the pilot urged the court to pass an “appropriate direction” for the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to allow inspection of the aircraft and provide information about its airworthiness. 
The petitioner also sought “to initiate criminal proceedings against those who are responsible for the damage of the PIA aircraft Boeing 777-200 registration number AP-BGL”. 
He claimed that the CAA had grounded the aircraft due to lack of airworthiness and the aircraft was parked at Jinnah Terminal, thus causing “millions of rupees loss to the airline and national treasure”. 
Mr Hussain also attached a complete list of technical defects in the aircraft as “reflected by the engineering department”. According to the petition, the aircraft had not flown since March 2020 “whereas in February, it took 69 flights”. 
The 329-seater plane had made the first flight in March 2004. 
Talking to Dawn, counsel for the petitioner Nabeel Javed Kahloon said they would submit another application to the court on Monday (today) requesting it to constitute a high-level commission of technical experts, well experienced and trained on Boeing 777 aircraft, to inspect the aircraft and submit a complete investigation report on the “structural damages” along with facts of the incident before the court. 
Through the supplementary application, Mr Kahloon said, they would also urge the court to direct the CAA to take the aircraft’s custody from PIA under Section 272 of the Civil Aviation Rules 1994 so that no one could tamper with the evidence. 
PIA spokesman
A PIA spokesman, however, declared that there was no truth in the reports that the aircraft had been rendered useless. 
In a statement, he admitted that the aircraft was “partially damaged” during an anti-hijacking drill, but claimed that the damage had been repaired. 
“The plane is parked at the long storage,” he said. 
“The aircraft is parked at the long storage as the use of Boeing 777 had been decreased due to travelling curbs in the wake of Covid-19,” the spokesman added. 
He said the plane would be made operational when travel restrictions would be lifted. He said the use of Boeing aircraft would increase after the decision of Saudi Arabia to allow direct flights from Pakistan. He added that the aircraft would be made operational as soon as the flights on long routes resumed.

5,JI chief asks ‘establishment’ to stay away from politics,"Sirajul Haq raises the issue of missing persons, reminds the prime minister of his old claims about the long lingering tragedy.","ISLAMABAD: Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) emir Sirajul Haq has asked the “establishment” to stop interference in the country’s political affairs if it wants to avoid public criticism. 
This was stated by Mr Haq while addressing the participants of a youth march organised by the party here on Sunday, said a press release.
The JI Youth Pakistan had organised the march of unemployed educated people from across the country in the federal capital to protest against joblessness and inflation. The participants of the march raised slogans against the anti-youth policies of the government. 
Reminding the prime minister of his promise to create 10 million jobs, the protesters marched from Embassy Road to D-Chowk and vowed to continue struggle for their rights until the rulers ensure provision of their rights. 
Sirajul Haq said it had been proved after three years that the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) lacked the capacity and vision to run the country. Unemployment and inflation were uncontrolled and more than 20 million children were out of schools due to poverty, he said, adding that the ruling elite never paid attention to the common man’s issues whether it was the government of the PTI or the former regimes of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and Pakistan Peoples Party. 
The JI chief said the people from Karachi to Gwadar were protesting for their rights but the rulers were not willing to listen to their demands. He urged the government to address the demands of fishermen of Gwadar and ensure compensation to the Nasla Town-affected people.
Mr Haq also raised the issue of missing persons, reminding the prime minister of his old claims about the long lingering tragedy. He said the rulers must address the deprivations of the people of Balochistan. He hailed the struggle of JI Karachi chapter emir Hafiz Naeemur Rahman and JI Balochistan chapter secretary general Maulana Hidayatur Rahman for fighting for the rights of the residents of Karachi and Gwadar. He also congratulated JI Youth president Zubair Gondal on organising a peaceful and successful march of the youth.
JI secretary general Ameerul Azim and other leaders also spoke on occasion.

6,Asma Jahangir conference organisers reject allegations of pursuing partisan agenda,"“We will not follow vendettas of political parties when inviting speakers,"" says the Asma Jahangir Foundation.","LAHORE: The organisers of Asma Jahangir conference on Sunday rejected the government’s allegations of following any partisan agenda. 
The third conference held in the provincial capital last week generated a lot of debate with the ruling PTI government pointing an accusing finger at the organisers. 
According to a news release, the conference was put together as a result of months of voluntary work by its committee setting out a wide agenda on critical areas of human rights currently under challenge in Pakistan. The conference was co-organised by the Asma Jahangir (AJ) Foundation, Pakistan Bar Council and Supreme Court Bar Association of Pakistan. 
There were total 21 sessions addressing the following areas: The Right to Dissent, The Afghan Crisis and its Impact, Conflict in Kashmir: bypassing Kashmiris, No Justice in Justifying: Violence Against Women, Rights of the Child, Freedom of Religion and Belief, State of the Economy, and Challenges to Restoring Democracy in Pakistan. 

Reiterate no one was invited in violation of law

As per the traditions, the AJ Foundation said, the closing speech at the conference was delivered by PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif as PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Minister for Human Rights Shirin Mazari had delivered the closing speeches at the first conference in 2018 and former prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani at the second conference in 2019. 
According to the press release, all the three conferences provided a platform for stakeholders, including politicians from all major and regional parties, to speak openly on issues impacting the rule of law and protection of fundamental freedoms. 
The AJ Foundation vehemently rejected the claims that the conference furthered any partisan agenda and noted that no such allegations were made at earlier conferences when Mr Bhutto-Zardari and Mr Gilani had delivered the closing speeches. 
The foundation said several prominent members of the ruling PTI had been invited to the conferences, many of whom spoke at all the three conferences while others declined the invitation. It reiterated that no one was invited to speak at the conference in violation of any law. 
The organisers said the Pakistan Electronic Media Authority had banned certain categories of individuals from being broadcast on television, but no such prohibition was placed on these individuals addressing public gatherings in general. 
Indeed, the foundation added, former PM Nawaz Sharif had addressed gatherings previously and it was entirely regrettable, not to say embarrassing, that internet cables were disabled to black out his speech. “This act in itself is an indication of the state of freedom of expression in the current regime where Pakistan is ranked 145 out of 180 countries.” 
The AJ Foundation said it stood firmly by civil society in Pakistan to protect universal principles of human rights without fear or favour. “We will not follow vendettas of political parties when inviting speakers and will remain an open and uncensored platform for diverse voices across the political spectrum.” 
It added: “It is the unanimous position of almost all bar councils that every person, including an absconder, has the right to freedom of expression and this right is enshrined in our Constitution. To brand the event as engaging in party politics is disappointing and no such claims were made at previous conferences where opposition leaders delivered the closing address.”

7,19 doctors arrested for blocking key roads in Quetta,Police arrested the doctors in light of a recently-promulgated ordinance banning all protest rallies on highways and roads.,"QUETTA: Police arrested 19 doctors on Sunday for staging a protest sit-in and blocking roads linking the city’s Red Zone with its other areas. 
Members of the Young Doctors Association, along with paramedical and nursing staff associations, have been staging a protest sit-in near the Red Zone, blocking all roads leading to the Go­v­ernor and the Chief Minister houses and the Balochistan Civil Secr­etariat for the last one week for acceptance of their demands. 
The doctors have been demanding improvement in government hospitals’ conditions, provision of medicines for patients, installation of modern medical equipment in hospitals and security of doctors and paramedical staff.
The Balochistan High Court recently ordered the protesting doctors and para-medical staff to end their protest. 
Leaders of the doctors threatened to spread their protest across the province if their demands were not accepted.
They recently held a meeting with the health authorities, but the meeting produced no result and the doctors and para-medical staff continued their protest.
Police arrested the doctors in the light of recently-promulgated ordinance banning all protest processions and rallies on highways and roads. 
A case was registered against arrested doctors and others under different sections and violation of Criminal Law Ordi­nance, corona SOPs and road blocking, police officials said.
Meanwhile, the Chairman of the Young Doctors Association, Dr Hafeez Mandokhail, while speaking at a press conference on Sunday warned that if all arrested doctors were not released within 48 hours, the doctors would spread their protest across the province to press the government for acceptance of their demands.
The chairman asked young doctors, nurses and paramedics working in government hospitals across the province to reach Quetta and take part in their just protest. 
Aziz Kakar, the leader of Nurses Association, and Mr Usman of Paramedics Association were also present on the occasion.
Dr Mandokhail said that their protest sit-in was peaceful and there was no justification for arresting doctors who were par­ticipating in the protest for acceptance of their just demands as holding of protest rallies against injustice was their right guaranteed to them by the Constitution of the country. 
He said Chief Minister Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo should order release of all arrested doctors and withdrawal of cases against them. 
He said that these young doctors had provided services to the people during the Covid-19 and some of “our colleagues and paramedics have lost their lives while serving the masses”.
