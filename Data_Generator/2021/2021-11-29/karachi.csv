0,Veterinary team examines elephants at Karachi's Safari Park,The team was extended all-out cooperation by officials during their visit to the Safari Park.,"KARACHI: A team of veterinary doctors and animal experts from the international animal rights group called Four Paws landed in Karachi early on Sunday to assess the health and well-being of the four female African elephants kept at the Safari Park and the Karachi Zoological Gardens.
There are two female elephants, Sonu and Malika, being kept in Safari Park. And the other two female elephants, Madhubala and Noor, are at Karachi Zoo. The team is expected to carry out tests and take blood samples of the elephants.
All the four elephants were imported from Tanzania several years ago. They are the last of elephants from Africa in Pakistan. Earlier, this year, videos surfaced showing they had broken and injured nails, cracked tusks, swollen legs, and damaged feet. Many animal rights activists moved the Sindh High Court (SHC) while raising serious doubts about the animals’ well-being.
Just a few days ago, there was also news along with heart-wrenching painful pictures of a white lion, which died in Karachi Zoo, reportedly due to poor nutrition, negligence of authorities and lack of medication.
It was a plea from animal rights activists following the incident that prompted the SHC to request Four Paws to examine the elephants and submit a report on Nov 30 (tomorrow) on their health condition and well-being.
The team of veterinarians and animal experts is headed by Dr Amir Khalil, who is well-known in Pakistan for his role in the successful relocation of the male elephant Kaavan last year from Islamabad’s Marghazar Zoo to a sanctuary for elephants in Cambodia. He is also called ‘Kaavan’s saviour’.
Dr Khalil is accompanied by Dr Frank Göritz and Prof Thomas Hildebrandt from the Leibnitz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research (IZW) and Dr Marina Ivanova from Four Paws.
Animal rights activist Advocate Owais Awan and film-maker Mahera Omar of the animal rights group PAWS are co-petitioners in the SHC.
The team was extended all-out cooperation by officials during their visit to the Safari Park. 
During a briefing later, Dr Khalil said that his team worked closely with the responsible national authorities who support their decision-making regarding the future care of the elephants, who are between 12 and 14 years of age.
“We are grateful for the trust of the Sindh High Court in our expertise and happy to support the authorities in making sure these elephants receive species-appropriate care.
“We will perform medical examinations on all four elephants, check their feet and assess their keeping conditions,” said Dr Khalil, adding that Four Paws also brought medicine and equipment for treating the elephants in case any urgent medical action was required.
Following their assessment, the Four Paws experts will propose their recommendations to the SHC for taking of the outcomes into further consideration.

1,Commercial operation of Green Line to begin on Dec 25: Asad,Cost of federal-funded project has reached Rs35bn...,"KARACHI: After almost six years of its ground-breaking and having suffered many hiccups over the period incurring almost double the cost, the federal-funded Green Line Bus Rapid Transit Service (BRTS) is all set to offer its services to Karachiites from December 25.
An announcement regarding initiation of the Green Line’s commercial operation was made by a key member of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, who also mentioned that the trial service of the bus would be launched within the next 10 days. 
However, the key question about the fare and any subsidy for the people of Karachi on the first-ever federal-funded transport service in the city remained unanswered.
“I conducted a detailed review of the Karachi Green Line project yesterday,” Federal Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Asad Umar said in a tweet. “This project will be ready for trial operation in the next 10 days. After that Prime Minister Imran Khan will visit Karachi for its launch. Insha Allah, the commercial operation will begin on December 25.” 

Cost of federal-funded project has reached Rs35bn

On Sunday, speaking at a party programme in district Central, Asad Umar said that only 10-12 days of work had been left in completion of Green Line following which PM Khan would inaugurate it.
Envisaged and executed in February 2016 by then prime minister Nawaz Sharif, the Green Line project was originally scheduled to complete within a year with an estimated cost of around Rs16.85 billion. However, it took almost six years to complete and the cost reached Rs35bn to finish the project. 
It was approved by the Executive Committee of National Economic Council and executed by the Sindh Infra­structure Development Com­pany Limited. 
Starting from KESC Powerhouse Chowrangi in Surjani Town, the bus service is to terminate at Merewether Tower via Nagan Chowrangi, North Nazimabad, Nazimabad and Gurumandir, with 21 stations along its route. 
A total of 80 buses for the Green Line project had arrived in the city in two consignments, removing the last hurdle in the first-ever Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) for Karachi. 
“During the test, the limited number of buses would be plied on the route,” said a source privy to the details of the project. “All 80 buses of the fleet would be tested with rotation. The test operation may last two weeks or so and then a fully fledged operation will be finally launched from December 25.” 
Sindh-govt’s Orange Line 
However, with the formal commercial launch scheduled for Dec 25, question remains about the effectiveness of the project which was originally supposed to be connected with the Sindh government-funded Orange Line BRTS. 
Despite having the shortest route in all five BRTS, the Orange Line is yet to get completed even after five years to its ground-breaking. 
Many observers are sceptical about the launch of the Sindh government project as the federal-funded public transport scheme Green Line is set to open its service for Karachiites. 
“The development work on the Orange Line — which has been renamed after Abdul Sattar Edhi as the Abdul Sattar Edhi Line — has gathered some pace lately, but I am not sure it would be ready by December 25,” said a Sindh government official responding to a question about the possibility of its completion. 
He said that one could only make any assessment about the launch of the Orange Line service once the shipment of 20 buses from China arrived in the city. 
“The shipment is due in the next couple of weeks. And then other few minor jobs which need to be addressed. So I can’t say whether it will be ready by December 25 or not,” he added.

2,Sindh plans Pfizer booster shot for all adults,Booster jab will be offered to people who were already vaccinated with any of the Chinese vaccines.,"KARACHI: The provincial health department has decided to inoculate all people with a booster shot of Pfizer keeping in view the increased risk of transmission and re-infection posed by the new Covid-19 variant Omicron.
“The decision has been taken but the department is yet to make required arrangements for this purpose and announce a date for its launch,” said a health official.
The booster jab would be offered to people who were already vaccinated with any of the Chinese vaccines, Sinopharm, Sinovac and Cansino, he added.
Currently, the facility for the booster jab is available at the Dow University of Health Sciences and Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre.
Earlier, the federal government placed a complete ban on travel from seven countries in the wake of the discovery of a new heavily mutated variant of coronavirus that has recently been reported in South Africa.
Meanwhile, experts have called upon the government to improve Covid-19 surveillance facilities at airports and other entry points of the country, especially for passengers arriving from high-risk countries.

3,"Karachi's civil society demands job security, safety kits for sanitation workers","Rights activist Sadiq says janitors have been exploited, underpaid and treated like slaves.","KARACHI: A huge number of conscientious citizens, wearing neon orange safety vests, turned up at the Abdul Sattar Edhi Avenue in Defence to march for the rights of janitors on Sunday morning.
The ‘Justice for Janitors’ group headed by human rights activist Naeem Sadiq demanded justice, equality and dignity for janitors all over the country. They wanted janitors in all organisations of the state to be paid the minimum wage applicable in their province regardless of the nature of their employment. 
They demanded that all janitors be regularised after three months of work and be registered with Employees Old-age Benefits Institution (EOBI) and Social Security. 
They said that no janitor must ever be made to enter a gutter without a safety kit including a hazmat suit, safety harnesses, ropes, breathing devices and gas testing. 

Rights activist Sadiq says janitors have been exploited, underpaid and treated like slaves

They wanted all government advertisement for sanitary workers’ jobs asking for only non-Muslims to be banned. And they wanted the manual entry of janitors for cleaning of gutters to be replaced by machines.
“The expense of the mechanical equipment for manual cleaning may be recovered by selling the large television sets that are now found in most government offices and only contribute in wasting the time and attention of the bureaucrats,” Mr Sadiq told Dawn.
“The pillars of the state and society have let the janitors down ever since the creation of Pakistan. They have been exploited, underpaid and treated like slaves. Not a single janitor here gets the minimum wage as set by the government. They have been living in extreme poverty while being deprived of their dignity and humanity as they are made to work in the most appalling, repulsive and demeaning conditions. And people pass them by in their big luxurious cars without noticing their misery. They just accept what is going on. But we demand an extreme end to this cruelty,” he added.
Minimum wage not being paid to janitors
Artist, writer and activist Rumana Husain said that the minimum wage as set by the Sindh government is Rs25,000 but the janitors are still getting far less than that. “They are getting around Rs15,000,” she said.
Shabnum Abdullah, a member of the Justice for Janitors group, said they are also human beings but they have been ostracised. “Why this discrimination? These people clean our dirt. They keep us clean and we bury them in filth and turn our backs on them,” she said.
MPA Rabia Azfar Nizami said that she has been writing to all government and non-governmental organisations for the rights of janitors. “I have reached out to authorities, local municipalities, cantonments, hospitals, etc., to at least pay the legal minimum wages to janitors. The chief minister had announced Rs25,000 as minimum wage in the province but it has not happened for janitors. Even the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board, which is a government organisation, has not yet done the needful,” she said.
“What to talk of government organisations, municipalities and cantonment boards, when even the industry here is not giving them their due right. There are 40,000 industries in Sindh and not a single one of them is paying the minimum wage. They also hire children. The younger a janitor, the lesser he or she is paid,” she pointed out.
Zahid Farooq of the Urban Resource Centre said that because of the ill-treatment of janitors, they are reducing in numbers as the population grows.
Educationist Baela Raza Jamil said what is happening to janitors here is something to be realised by the educated people of this society to bring an end to the injustice.
Pastor Ghazala Shafiq from the Church of Pakistan said even the church is not paying due attention to the janitors who are mostly Christians. “I have been bringing up their issues in the church but so far there has been no result,” she said.
Another issue that the Pastor brought up was that janitorial positions are also handed out by people who are taking their salaries. “Someone gets a janitorial job for say, Rs20,000 and he does not do the job. Instead he calls in someone else to fill in for him on a smaller amount as he himself pockets the rest of the money and works somewhere else. This kind of handling also requires research,” she pointed out.

4,Policeman shot dead in Landhi encounter,KARACHI: A policeman was gunned down in an encounter with armed robbers in the Landhi area on Sunday evening....,"KARACHI: A policeman was gunned down in an encounter with armed robbers in the Landhi area on Sunday evening.

5,This week 50 years ago: Blackout in city and first computer at KU,"THE situation in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) was getting difficult to control by the day. As a result, border...","THE situation in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) was getting difficult to control by the day. As a result, border tensions between Pakistan and India were high. The authorities were trying their best to pre-empt any untoward incident. On Nov 29, 1971 it was reported that the provincial health department had set up 10 first-aid training centres in Karachi. The training had been arranged for men and women separately from 4pm to 5pm on a daily basis at centres which were made at Services Hospital, Police Hospital, Civil Hospital, Health Centre, Korangi and Government dispensaries located at Drigh Road, Malir Shed, Nazimabad, near Manghopir KMC Lepers’ Hospital, Saudabad Malir extension and Babar Market Landhi.
Given the seriousness of the geopolitical environment, Karachiites belonging to all spheres of life were coming forward to become razakars or volunteers. And by Nov 30, a large number of ‘educated’ persons, about 300 in number, had volunteered to join the Qaumi Razakar Force. Earlier in the week, a meeting was held under the chairmanship of the Karachi police chief, Mohammad Yousuf Orakzai, at which it was decided to organise the force on a large scale. On Dec 2, addressing the passing out parade of the trained razakars at Korangi, Landhi, Malir and Artillery Maidan police stations, respectively, Mr Orakzai urged upon the volunteers to work selflessly for the safety of their own locality in the grave situation arising due to the Indian army’s naked aggression. 
On Dec 3, a public rally held in the city by the women to condemn the barbarous Indian aggression against Pakistan called on the government to set up a ‘women’s national guard’ so that the female population could participate in the defence of the country. In a resolution adopted during the meeting arranged under the auspices of the Pakistan Razakr Khawateen, it was suggested that it could be established under the army’s supervision. 
And from the evening of Dec 3, a citywide blackout from sundown to sunrise was clamped until further orders as a precautionary measure against a possible air attack by the enemy aircraft. A spokesman for Civil Defence said the blackout should not be confused with “air raid” warning. 
Continuing with the subject safety measures, on Dec 5, it was announced that emergency squads of the Karachi Electric Supply Corporation (KESC, now KE) would remain mobile in all localities in the night to see if the blackout was being observed properly. They warned they would cut off power connection to those houses and establishments from where lights beamed out.
While all of this was happening, the very important education sector did not halt its activities. In fact, something pretty significant happened on Dec 1 when the University of Karachi’s (KU) first computer, installed in the Statistics Department and acquired at a cost of Rs125,000, was inaugurated by the vice chancellor of the institution, Dr Mahmood Husain. The computer was to be loaned to business organisations on a rental basis. It had been estimated that the cost of the computer could be recovered within a year through rental fees. It would be interesting to know where one can find that machine today!

6,Plan to make Karachi smoke-free,"‘Money spent on tobacco reduces households spending on food, health’...","KARACHI: The commissioner of Karachi on Sunday announced setting up of a tobacco control desk in his office for monitoring to make Karachi a smoke-free city.
The commissioner, Muhammad Iqbal Memon, said that district implementation and monitoring committees (DIMC) on tobacco control would also be formed for effective monitoring in all districts under the supervision of deputy commissioners.
He was speaking as a chief guest after inauguration of the Smoke-Free Karachi Cycling Rally from Empress Market to Mazar-i-Quaid held in collaboration with the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination (NHSRC). 

‘Money spent on tobacco reduces households spending on food, health’

He said that steps would be taken to make public service vehicles and restaurants smoke free.
“According to the data, the economic cost of smoking in Pakistan is Rs615.07 billion, which is equal to $3.85 billion and equal to 1.6 per cent of Pakistan’s GDP,” he added.
“An estimate suggests that in 2019, the economic cost of smoking was about five times greater than the revenue from the tobacco industry. Money spent on tobacco reduces households’ spending on food, health, education, housing, and household durables,” he said.
He said in Pakistan, tobacco-consuming households spend an average 2.7 per cent of their monthly budget on tobacco. 
The Karachi commissioner referred to a report of World Health Organisation that says the tobacco epidemic is one of the biggest public health threats the world has ever faced, killing more than eight million people a year around the world.

9,MQM-P defends demand for new administrative unit,HYDERABAD: Muttahida Qaumi Movement Pakistan (MQM-P) convener Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui says that his party stands...,"HYDERABAD: Muttahida Qaumi Movement Pakistan (MQM-P) convener Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui says that his party stands for a new province but only as an administrative unit while those who are describing this constitutional demand as treason are themselves guilty of committing this offence. 
He said while speaking at First urban graduate conference on realism and practicalism at a wedding hall in Latifabad on Sunday that slogan of new province was first written on walls and then removed but this time it would be written on people’s hearts.  
He said that if divisions or districts could be increased within a province the number of provinces could also be raised. Those who considered provinces indivisible took them in fact as a country, he said.  
Dr Siddiqui said that MQM had been a major hurdle to attempts for the creation of Sindhudesh. MQM was held responsible for the creation of certain conditions but the party itself was a product of these conditions, he said. 
He said that it was a great irony that since Pervez Musharraf era MQM-P’s ideological asset, philosophy and civilisation suffered weakness. People kept searching for ‘strength’ from outside the MQM by trying to appease establishment or rulers, he said. 
“Today, we are here to find this ‘strength’ from within MQM,” he said, adding that enemy always either contained or engaged and Musharraf’s era was a period of engagement while in 1992 MQM was contained.  
He said that MQM built flyovers but did not think about education. It created towns but did not think of province. Many universities could have been established if the degree of efforts seen over the last three years for a university in Hyderabad had been made during the last 30 years, he said.  
He said that federal university was not the last but the first university in Hyderabad. “I feel ashamed before you for celebrating establishment of a private university and you must forgive me for this,” he said referring to announcement for proposed Altaf Hussain University by Bahria Town in Hyderabad.  
He said that MQM-P’s direction today was correct and urged Urdu-speaking community to impose education emergency on them by devoting themselves to the cause of guiding less educated and helping those who were interested in appearing in combined competitive examinations. “We are ready to leave space for you,” he said.  
He said that today poor Urdu was spoken by those to whom it belonged. If Urdu had not been here Pakistan would have remained tongue-less. Pakistan’s economy rested on Urdu speakers’ patriotism. The size of taxes collected only in Liaquatabad area in Karachi was equivalent to total tax collected from entire Lahore, he said. 
Dr Siddiqui said that people should prepare themselves for enjoying better times now because those who had been beating MQM-P had become tired. Now last attempts were being made to break the community’s spirit, he said.

10,"No legislation against Shariah will be tolerated, says Fazl","LARKANA: Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) emir Maulana Fazlur Rehman paid homage to his long time fellow, Dr Khalid...","LARKANA: Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) emir Maulana Fazlur Rehman paid homage to his long time fellow, Dr Khalid Mehmood Soomro, the former Sindh secretary general of the party, at a mammoth gathering titled “Shaheed-i-Islam Qaumi Conference” held here on Saturday evening on the eve of his 7th death anniversary. 
Addressing party workers and supporters who packed the Municipal Stadium, Maulana Fazl said: “Our elders offered sacrifices ... they were jailed ... and even hanged for choosing the thorny path of truth and honesty as taught by Islam. Dr Khalid Soomro’s sacrifice was  continuity of our elders’ tradition”. His [Dr Soomro’s) assassins were mistaken to think that JUI-F’s struggle would come to a halt with the elimination of Dr Soomro, he said, adding that it instead flourished and was further flourishing.
Legislation by ‘fake’ assembly
Maulana Fazl, who is also chairman of opposition parties’ alliance Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), in unequivocal terms declared that any legislation done against the Constitution, the Holy Quran and Sunnah would never be accepted. He appealed to all political parties to lend their support to only those laws that were in conformity to the Constitution and Shariah.
“This fake assembly is doing legislation under the influence of West and in contravention of the Constitution,” he claimed.
PTI govt’s policies criticised
The JUI-F emir warned that his party would not allow turning of this country into a colony of any international force. “We will not tolerate an imposed system. Provinces of the country have their identity; and their residents are owners of their provincial resources. No one can dare to deprive them of their rights ... people of Sindh and Balochistan are owners of their respective islands,” he added.
Maulana Fazl also criticised federal government’s decision of linking State Bank of Pakistan with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and termed it a ‘big mistake’. He  posed a question: “Who is actually doing this?”
He noted that Pakistan’s economy was sinking while those of China, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Iran were growing. “Not only [Prime Minister] Imran Khan, but also those who brought him [to power] are responsible for the collapse of  our national economy,” he remarked.
He deplored the prime minister for “deceiving” youth by promising 10 million jobs and also the masses by promising 500,000 houses. “Unfortunately, 500,000 houses have been razed and five million youths rendered jobless,” he observed.
He also rejected legislation for introducing Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) in future elections, saying that the machine had already been rejected in India and other countries. “This legislation is aimed at rigging; the PTI government that came to power through rigging is aiming at getting itself re-elected through rigging,” he alleged.
Defence institution
Maulana Fazl asked the audience if they knew “why my defence institution is defamed”, and in the same breath told them that “some generals have committed mistakes”. He declared: “It is our own institution and we respect our institutions”.
About US insistence that Taliban should guarantee women’s rights in Afghanistan before their government could be recognised, he described the condition as a mockery. “It’s US that had unleashed a reign of terror and committed human rights violations during its 20 years of occupation of Afghanistan. Now it is talking of human rights in that country! Our memory about Guantanamo Bay is still fresh,” he remarked. 
Turning to the accountability of political figures, Maulana Fazl warned the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) that it would face the music if it initiated any action against him.
PDM general secretary and a former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi paid homage to Dr Soomro and deplored that seven years had elapsed but his  heirs were still waiting for justice. 
Calling for running the  country’s affairs in accordance with the Constitution, he said the masses would continue  to suffer until this was ensured. 
He said  institutions should remain within their constitutional limits. “Stealing election is today’s big issue ... people suffered whenever those  delivering justice interfered in elections,” he remarked.
Senator  Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri, Sahibzada  Muhammed Awais Noorani, Abdul Qayoom Halejvi, Akhtar Jahanzeb, Dr  Safdar Abbasi, Sanan Qureshi, Syed Siraj Amroti, Riaz  Chandio, Maulana Attaur Rehman and a host of other leaders spoke at the conference.

12,Larkana police try to allay fears of heirs as protests over CMC student’s mysterious death continue,Civil society protests against police failure to solve the case of the mysterious death and express solidarity with the family.,"DADU: Larkana SSP visited bereaved family members of Dr Nosheen here on Sunday and tried to allay their fears over police investigation into the mysterious death of their loved one, who was found hanging from a ceiling fan in her hostel room in Chandka Medical College on Nov 24, as protests continue over police failure to solve the case.  
SSP Imran Qureshi told media persons after meeting Dr Nosheen’s father Syed Hidayatullah Shah Kazmi, uncle Syed Fida Hussain Shah Kazmi and other family members that parents were right to have reservations over the probe but he had assured them that everything would be cleared up after the autopsy report was released.  
He said that on the face of it the incident appeared to be a suicide but the probe was under way to unearth evidence that might determine the nature of her death.  
He said that the victim’s mobile data showed she had talked only on three numbers, her father’s, mother’s and her friend’s. Police were honestly investigating this sensitive incident and would soon bring the facts to fore, he said.  
Meanwhile, activists of Awami Sath and a number of other civil society organisations took out a procession to express solidarity with family of Dr Nosheen and protest against police failure to solve the case of mysterious death. 
The protesters led by Abbas Vighio, Asif Jamali and Qadir Jamali warned if action was not taken against vice chancellor of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Medical University (SMBBMU), registrar, provost and warden of CMC hostel and real culprits involved in this tragic incident were not arrested, they would stage a demonstration before Bilawal House in Karachi and chief minister’s residence in Wahur village.  
They expressed surprise over the silence of PPP chairman and other leaders on the tragic incident and said the only recourse was to begin judicial inquiry into the student’s death.  
In Johi, a large number of townspeople took out a procession and demanded arres­ting the culprits involved in Dr Nosheen’s death.
