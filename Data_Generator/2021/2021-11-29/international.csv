She was already in labour and she gave birth an hour later.
“Big news!” the Greens politician posted on her Facebook page a few hours later.  “At 3.04am this morning we welcomed the newest member of our family. I genuinely wasn’t planning to cycle in labour, but it did end up happening.” 
The island nation of 5 million already has a reputation for down-to-earth politicians. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern famously took maternity leave while in office and brought her three-month old to a United Nations meeting as she was still breastfeeding.
“My contractions weren’t that bad when we left at 2am to go to the hospital — though they were 2-3 min apart and picking up in intensity by the time we arrived 10 minutes later,” Genter wrote.
“Amazingly now we have a healthy, happy little one sleeping, as is her dad,” said Genter, a dual New Zealand-US citizen who was born in Minnesota and moved to the Pacific country in 2006.
Genter — her party’s spokesperson for transport issues and whose Facebook profile includes “I love my bicycle” — also biked to the hospital in 2018 to give birth to her first-born, local media said.

1,Former Cambodian PM Ranariddh dies at 77,"PHNOM PENH: Cambodian former prime minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the current king’s half-brother, who spent...","PHNOM PENH: Cambodian former prime minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the current king’s half-brother, who spent his later years in the political shadow of his one-time rival Prime Minister Hun Sen, has died in France. He was 77.
The prince, whose royalist political party won elections in 1993, was ousted in a 1997 coup by coalition partner Hun Sen, who remains Cambodia’s authoritarian leader.
Hun Sen said in a statement on Sunday that he and his wife were  “heartbroken” at the news, calling Ranariddh  “a dignitary, (a) member of the royal family who was patriotic to the nation, religion, the king”.
Ranariddh was the most political member of Cambodia’s royal family in recent decades, leading his Funcinpec party in elections for years after he was ousted.
But in 2017, he dismayed Cambodia’s weakened opposition by backing the dissolution of another party whose leader was jailed on treason charges. Hun Sen has since effectively sidelined all opposition and now presides over a one-party parliament. Explaining his position, Ranariddh said that year: ”... Hun Sen, you want or you don’t want, you like him or you don’t like him, he brings about this national unity.”  His younger half-brother, King Norodom Sihamoni, has occupied the Cambodian throne since the abdication of their father, 
King Norodom Sihanouk in 2004. Sihanouk died aged 89 in 2012 in Beijing. Lao Mong Hay, a veteran Cambodian analyst, said Ranariddh had lacked the political savvy of his father.
“He was soon outwitted and overthrown by his far more talented rival,” Lao Mong Hay said, citing a Cambodian proverb that 10 learned persons are less than one talented person.  “So Norodom Ranariddh happened to be one of those 10.” Ranariddh’s career reflected the way Hun Sen has neutralized rivals since defecting from the Khmer Rouge  “killing fields” regime in the late 1970s to help drive it from power.
Hun Sen led the Vietnam-backed Communist government in Phnom Penh for more than a decade while the Khmer Rouge waged a guerrilla insurgency.
The royal family lived in exile during this time, headed by former absolute ruler Sihanouk, who had led Cambodia to independence from France and abdicated a first time to enter democratic politics and become prime minister before the Khmer Rouge takeover in 1975.
Ranariddh was working as a French law lecturer when his father called him to contest the 1993 elections organised by the United Nations as part of a peace process. With royalist sentiment strong, Ranariddh won the elections. But when Hun Sen threatened a return to war, a political deal resulted in a coalition government making Ranariddh  “first prime minister”, Hun Sen  “second prime minister” and returning King Sihanouk to the throne as constitutional monarch.

2,"France seeks EU help over migrants, snubs UK","“We cannot accept that any more people die,” says French interior minister.","CALAIS: France sought help from its European neighbours on Sunday to crack down on Channel people-smuggling gangs, with Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin saying he could  “not accept” any more deaths after an unprecedented accident claimed 27 lives.
Ministers responsible for immigration from France, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium convened in the northern French port of Calais on Sunday afternoon, but without Britain which was excluded after a row last week.
“The biggest point for this meeting is the fight against people-smugglers who take advantage of our borders and countries,” Darmanin said at the start of the event, adding that  “migratory pressures continue and are constantly increasing”.
“These deaths are too many,” he said of the accident which saw 27 people drown on Wednesday after their inflatable dinghy began losing aircrossing the English Channel in wintry temperatures.  “We cannot accept that any more people die.” 
The main focus was to have been scheduled talks between Darmanin and British counterpart Priti Patel after both countries vowed to cooperate to tackle a surge in crossings this year which has seen around 26,000 people set off from France to England.
But within 48 hours of Wednesday’s disaster, French President Emmanuel Macron had accused British Prime Minister Boris Johnson of being  “not serious”.
Paris was irked by Johnson’s initial reaction, which was seen as deflecting blame onto France, and then by his decision to write a letter to Macron which he published in full on his Twitter account before the French leader had received it.
Patel’s invitation to Sunday’s talks was withdrawn over the breach of diplomatic protocol, with an aide to Darmanin calling Johnson’s letter  “unacceptable”.
Britain’s departure from the European Union has caused years of ill-will between Paris and London, with relations seen as at their lowest point in at least two decades. Under-fire Patel called her absence  “unfortunate” but said she would be holding  “urgent talks” with European counterparts this week.
She spoke on Sunday morning with Dutch Immigration Minister Ankie Broekers-Knol, with a statement from the Home Office saying  “the tragic incidents of last week demonstrate the need for European partners to work together”.
Without the participation of Britain — the intended destination country for the thousands of migrants and asylum seekers massed in northern France — there are limits to what can be achieved at Sunday’s meeting in Calais.
The EU’s home affairs commissioner Ylva Johansson, as well as the directors of the border force Frontex and police agency Europol also attended.
People-smuggling gangs are known to use Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany as bases to organise their operations. Many migrants are believed to travel to launch sites in northern France from Belgium, while inflatables and life jackets can be bought in other countries such as the Netherlands and Germany without raising suspicion.
One of the five men arrested in connection with Wednesday’s tragedy was driving a car with German registration, according to French officials.
While France and Britain agree on the need to tackle people-smugglers more effectively, they remain at odds over how to prevent people taking to the water.
In his public letter to Macron, Johnson again pressed for British police and border agents to patrol alongside their French counterparts on the coast of northern France — something rejected by Paris in the past as an infringement on sovereignty.

3,Woman sets fire to Covid quarantine hotel in Australia,No one was injured in the fire; police official says the woman is in custody.,"SYDNEY: Australian police said on Sunday they expect to charge a 31-year-old woman with arson after she allegedly set fire to the Covid-19 quarantine hotel where she and her two children were staying.
No one was injured in the fire, which gutted much of the 11th floor of the Pacific Hotel Cairns, police said. More than 100 people were evacuated from the hotel.
The incident in the northern city of Cairns occurred as tensions rose in parts of Australia as a result of coronavirus restrictions and the latest scare caused by the emergence of the Omicron variant, first identified in southern Africa.
Acting Chief Superintendent Chris Hodgman said the woman was in custody and police were caring for her children.
“I expect later on this morning that 31-year-old female will be charged with arson and the possibility of other offences,” he told reporters.
The woman had been in quarantine for a couple of days and there had been issues with her that authorities  “were managing,” Hodgman said.

4,"Migrants should not be ‘instrumentalised’, says Pope",VATICAN CITY: Pope Francis on Sunday expressed sorrow over migrants who have died trying to reach Europe in search ...,"VATICAN CITY: Pope Francis on Sunday expressed sorrow over migrants who have died trying to reach Europe in search of a better life, saying they should not be  “instrumentalised.” 
“I think of those who died crossing the English Channel, those on the borders of Belarus, many of whom are children, and those who drown in the Mediterranean. There is so much sorrow when thinking about them,” the pope said during his Sunday Angelus prayer.
“I renew my heartfelt appeal to those who can contribute to the resolution of these problems, especially civil and military authorities, so that understanding and dialogue may finally prevail over any kind of instrumentalisation.” 
The pontiff spoke after 27 people drowned in the Channel on Wednesday trying to reach Britain.
In Belarus, a migrant crisis has seen thousands of people, mostly Kurds from Iraq, stuck on the border as they try to enter EU member Poland.
The EU has accused Belarus strongman President Alexander Lukashenko of orchestrating the crisis in retaliation for EU sanctions against the ex-Soviet state, charges that Minsk has denied.
The  pope asked the faithful gathered in St. Peters Square for the  traditional Sunday blessing to pray for migrants and their suffering. 
Those present included members of an association of migrants with whom  he met a day earlier at the Vatican, and who held an enormous banner  comprised of flags from countries around the world.
How many  migrants, lets think about this, how many migrants are exposed to very  serious dangers also in recent days? How many lose their lives at our  borders? the pontiff said.
I feel pain at the news of the  situation in which many find themselves. Of those who died in the  English Channel, of those at the border of Belarus, many of whom are  children. Those who drown in the Mediterranean. How much sorrow,  thinking of them.
The deaths of 27 migrants in the English Channel  have shocked both Britain and France. Still, shipwrecks of that scale  are not uncommon further south in the Mediterranean Sea as migrants flee  poverty, natural disasters and authoritarian regimes for a better life  in Europe.
UN officials estimate that as many as 1,600 people have died  or are missing in the Mediterranean this year alone, their bodies  usually not found and their deaths related only by survivors.

Hundreds of macaques, also known as long-tailed monkeys, were seen climbing on people and stacks of fruit, munching away on bananas and pineapples.
The feast, which cost over 100,000 baht ($3,000), is an annual tradition for locals to thank the monkeys for doing their part in drawing in tourists to Lopburi, which is sometimes known as  “Monkey Province.”  “Today’s special is durian, which is expensive. Lopburi monkeys like expensive things,” said Yongyuth Kitwatananusont who has previously organised over 30 monkey festivals.
The theme for this year’s festival was wheelchair monkeys, and Yongyuth planned to donate 100 wheelchairs to needy people. Tourists have been gradually returning to Thailand after the government launched a quarantine-free travel scheme for vaccinated tourists in November, and the festival proved a popular draw.

6,US Navy rescues two Iranians adrift in Gulf for eight days,"The men were in  “good health and spirits” despite their ordeal, the navy says.","MANAMA: The US Navy has rescued two Iranian seamen who had been adrift for eight days on a fishing boat in Gulf waters, a statement said on Sunday.
The men were in  “good health and spirits” despite their ordeal, the navy said.
“A US Navy vessel rescued two Iranian mariners (on Saturday) from a fishing vessel after it was adrift for eight days in the Gulf of Oman,” the US Naval Forces Central Command, or NAVCENT, said.
Navy cargo ship Charles Drew arrived at the scene with food, water and medical care six hours after a distress call from the mariners, the statement said.
The two men were transported to an Omani coastguard vessel near the capital Muscat.  “The mariners were in good health and spirits at the time of the transfer,” it added.
“We appreciate the government of Oman for its assistance and support in helping us return the mariners home,” NAVCENT commander Vice Admiral Brad Cooper said in the statement.
The United States and its regional allies share concerns about Iran, which has previously been accused of orchestrating attacks on shipping in the region.
Tehran rejects the allegations.
Since February, Iran and its arch-enemy Israel have been accused of engaging in what analysts have called a  “shadow war”, in which vessels linked to each nation have come under attack in tit-for-tat exchanges in waters around the Gulf.
Earlier this month, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain held their first joint naval exercise with Israel, together with the US, a year after normalising ties with the Jewish state.

7,Researchers trying to produce potato resistant to climate change,BANGOR: University of Maine researchers are trying to produce potatoes that can better withstand warming ...,"BANGOR: University of Maine researchers are trying to produce potatoes that can better withstand warming temperatures as the climate changes.
Warming temperatures and an extended growing season can lead to quality problems and disease, Gregory Porter, a professor of crop ecology and management, told the Bangor Daily News.
The predictions for climate change are heavier rainfall events, and potatoes don’t tolerate flooding or wet conditions for long without having other quality problems, Porter said. If we want potatoes to be continued to be produced successfully in Maine, we need to be able to produce varieties that can be resistant to change.
Around the world, research aimed at mitigating crop damage is underway. A Nasa study published this month suggests climate change may affect the production of corn and wheat, reducing yields of both, as soon as 2030.
Maine is coming off of a banner potato crop thanks in part to the success of the Caribou russet, which was developed by UMaine researchers. But Porter fears that even that variety isn’t as heat tolerant as necessary to resist the future effects of climate change. Pests are another factor. The Colorado potato beetle and disease-spreading aphids have flourished with the changing climate, said Jim Dill, pest management specialist at the University of Maine Cooperative Extension.
Breeding seemingly small changes like hairier leaves that make it difficult for insects to move around on the plant can cut down on pests destruction and also the need for pesticides, he said.
Breeding such characteristics into potatoes is a long process of cross-pollinating different potato varieties. The process is well underway.
They’re in a research testing phase right now at sites throughout the United States. Test potatoes in Virginia, North Carolina and Florida are testing high temperature stress. It takes 10 years of selection after that initial cross pollination, and it might take two to five years before enough commercial evaluation has taken place to release a new potato variety, Porter said.

8,Police patrol Isfahan’s dry river after water riots in Iran,The protests since November 9 have drawn at times thousands of demonstrators to the city.,"TEHRAN: Iranian riot police on Sunday patrolled a dried-out riverbed in the central city of Isfahan where protests against a water shortage led to violent clashes two days earlier.
Drought and water diversions have been blamed for drying up the Zayandeh-Rood waterway that runs from the Zagros mountains and through the city known for its iconic river bridges.
Water protests since November 9 have drawn at times thousands of demonstrators to the city, where a large rally on Friday escalated into clashes in which 67 people were arrested.
Calm has returned and it held on Sunday, a local photographer said by phone from Isfahan, the country’s third-largest city 340 kilometres (210 miles) south of Tehran.
“In the morning, the city was calm and traffic was normal,” the photographer said.  “I saw riot police patrolling the riverbed between the historic bridges, but their numbers were lower than on Saturday.” 
The protesters blame the authorities for diverting water to neighbouring Yazd province, which is also desperately short of water.
Authorities on Saturday announced 67 arrests of the  “main perpetrators and troublemakers” in the rally that had drawn  “2,000 to 3,000 rioters”.
The arrests were made by the police, intelligence services and the Revolutionary Guards.
Police had on Friday fired tear gas at the protesters, who threw stones, smashed the windows of an ambulance and set a police motorbike ablaze, according to the Fars news agency.
Sun-baked earth
Nourodin Soltanian, a spokesman for Isfahan University Hospital, said a number of protesters were wounded, including  “two in serious condition”.
Isfahan police chief Mohammad-Reza Mirheidari called the protesters  “opportunists and counter-revolutionaries”, and the ultraconservative newspaper Kayhan accused  “mercenary thugs” of being behind the  “riots”.
US State Department spokesman Ned Price said Washington was  “deeply concerned about the violent crackdown against peaceful protestors”.
He added on Twitter that  “the people of Iran have a right to voice their frustrations and hold their government accountable”.
The Kayhan daily meanwhile also linked Friday’s protests to the scheduled resumption of nuclear talks on Monday in Vienna between Iran and a group of major powers.
Friday’s events  “testify to the infiltration of a US fifth column, in the run-up to the Vienna talks, to provoke a riot and push for (new) US sanctions” against Iran, it said.
The Zayandeh-Rood river that runs through Isfahan has been dry since 2000, except for a few brief periods.
Iran has endured repeated droughts over the past decade, but also regular floods, a phenomenon that can intensify when torrential rains fall on sun-baked earth.
Scientists say climate change amplifies droughts and that their intensity and frequency in turn threaten food security.

“The individual was evaluated by Emergency Medical Services and taken to a hospital for medical assessment,” said a statement from a US Customs and Border Protection spokesman.
There was no immediate information on the man’s identity or condition, though the risk of falling and the extreme cold at high altitude pose grave dangers.
The American Airlines flight from Guatemala lasted nearly three hours, the Miami Herald reported.
It posted a video showing a thin, bedraggled looking man sitting shakily on the tarmac near the plane’s landing gear as airport staff tried to help him.
In February 2018, two stowaways fell to their death from an airplane as it took off from an airport in Guayaquil, Ecuador on a flight to New York. 
And during this summer’s chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan, a number of stowaways appeared to fall to their death from the undercarriage of airplanes evacuating people from Kabul airport.
“Persons are taking extreme risks when they try to conceal themselves in confined spaces such as an aircraft,” the Customs and Border Patrol statement said.

The Saturday evening bombing south of the city of Sulaimaniyah underlined the  “serious threat” IS still poses to the Kurdistan region four years after the Iraqi government declared victory over the jihadists, the region’s prime minister Masrour Barzani said.
The region’s peshmerga ministry said the slain fighters who were hit had been on their way to reinforce comrades who had come under attack by IS fighters.
“We have warned time and again about the dangers posed by the Islamic State group terrorists,” Barzani said.
The last major attack blamed on IS in Iraq was an assault on a checkpoint south of Kirkuk that killed 13 policemen in September.
The last major attack claimed by IS was a July bombing in the Baghdad Shiite district of Sadr City, which killed 30 people.
IS seized swathes of Iraq in a lightning offensive in 2014, before being beaten back by a counter-insurgency campaign supported by a US-led military coalition.
The Iraqi government declared the Sunni extremists defeated in late 2017, but the jihadists retain sleeper cells which continue to strike security forces with hit-and-run attacks.

11,Bangladeshi doctors fear for Khaleda Zia’s life,She has been barred by a court from leaving the country after being convicted on graft charges in 2018.,"DHAKA: Bangladeshi doctors treating ailing opposition leader and ex-premier Khaleda Zia said on Sunday they feared for her life if she was not allowed to fly abroad for medical care.
Zia, 76, arch-rival of current Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, has been diagnosed with liver cirrhosis. Her doctors said she suffered three massive internal bleedings in the past two weeks.
“We don’t have the means and supportive technology... here to control and stop rebleeding,” her chief doctor Fakhruddin Mohammad Siddiqui told reporters at her home, flanked by four other doctors on her medical team.
He said there was a 50 percent chance that Zia would suffer another internal bleeding in the next week, and a 70 percent chance it would occur in the next six weeks.
“The chances of controlling the rebleeding are slim,” he said.  “In that case, there is higher risk of her death.”  “If we want to save the life of the patient, we need to do TIPS,” he said, referring to a sophisticated medical procedure that he said was available only in developed countries such the United States, Britainand Germany. Zia has been in the critical care unit of a Dhaka hospital since November 13, just five months after she recovered from Covid-19.
But the leader of the main opposition party has been barred by a court from leaving the country after being convicted on graft charges in 2018.
As her condition has worsened, activists and supporters of her Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) have staged protests across the country, demanding she be allowed to travel abroad for treatment. In the northern district of Natore, about 20 people were injured on November 22 when BNP activists clashed with police.
Hasina earlier this month appeared to reject Zia’s family and her party’s pleas.
“I have done whatever I can for Khaleda Zia. Now the law will decide the next course of action,” Hasina told a press briefing.
A minister also suggested that the BNP fly in doctors from abroad.
Zia was sentenced to 10 years in prison in February 2018 on graft charges that the BNP, which was last in power from 2001 to 2006, says were politically motivated.
She was released in March last year as her condition worsened in a jail where she was the only inmate. She has since been barred from flying abroad and has been receiving treatment from a local hospital.
Her doctors and party allege that Zia — who is suffering from heart failure, rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes — was not treated properly when she was imprisoned.

12,Barbados will spur others to ditch the Queen: experts,Barbados will become the world's newest republic today.,"LONDON: On a rainy night in Hong Kong in 1997, Prince Charles read a message from his mother Queen Elizabeth II, as Britain handed back sovereignty of the territory to China after more than 150 years of UK rule.
On Monday, nearly a quarter of a century on, Charles will be present at another handover, when Barbados becomes the world’s newest republic, with an elected president — not the queen — as head of state.
The ceremony will not be on the same scale as in Hong Kong, when military marching bands and bagpipes provided the backdrop to a momentous occasion that was described as  “the epilogue of empire”.
But the Caribbean island’s abandonment of constitutional monarchy is significant, not just for the monarch and her heir, but for the new republic — and others that may follow.
Joe Little, the managing editor of Majesty Magazine, said the declaration was a  “natural progression” of a trend that began soon after the queen took the throne in 1952.
“I think inevitably it’s one that will continue, not necessarily in this current reign but in the next — and probably accelerate,” he said.
Royal officials have said little about the end of nearly four painful centuries of British rule and influence on Barbados, which was a key centre in the slave trade.
“This is a matter for the government and people of Barbados,” Buckingham Palace said when the authorities in Bridgetown set out its intentions last year.
However, it sends a clear message that in the twilight of the 95-year-old queen’s reign, and when Charles, 73, succeeds, the British monarchy’s global reach is diminished.
‘Democracy day’
In 1947, five years before she became queen, Britain saw the  “Jewel in the Crown” — India — emerge as an independent republic.
After Elizabeth took the throne in 1952, independence movements swept Britain’s former colonies, severing ties to the crown that were bound by commerce and bloody conquest.
But between 1983 and 1987, Elizabeth was still queen of an astonishing 18 countries.
Fiji (1987) and Mauritius (1992) have since become republics, following in the footsteps of Caribbean nations Dominica, Guyana, and Trinidad and Tobago in the 1970s.
In doing so now, tiny Barbados, with a population of just under 300,000, could start a domino effect in the queen’s 14 remaining Commonwealth realms outside Britain.
Professor Hilary Beckles, a Barbadian historian, called Monday’s event — on the eve of Barbados’ 55th anniversary of independence —  “an historic moment” with far-reaching significance.
For Barbados, the Caribbean and all post-colonial societies, it represents freedom from the  “tyranny of imperial and colonial authority”, and the  “brutal legacy” of slavery and genocidal oppression, he said this week.
“History has given Barbados this responsibility to move forward into the 21st century” with pride, dignity and honour, he added, calling Tuesday  “a democracy day”.
Republican sentiment
The queen has consistently been the most popular royal in Britain and beyond, and is seen as the symbol of the country post-war as well as the last living link to its imperial past.
When the succession comes, with the more controversial Charles lacking that history, experts predict the republican question will be asked with more urgency in Commonwealth countries — and even possibly in the UK.
Little said the push for an elected head of state was more than likely in places such as Australia and to a lesser extent Canada.
