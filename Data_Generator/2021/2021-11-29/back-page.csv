0,Australian govt vows to unmask online trolls,"“The online world should not be a wild west where bots and bigots and trolls"" can harm people, says Prime Minister Scott Morrison.","SYDNEY: Australia’s government said on Sunday it will introduce legislation to unmask online trolls, and hold social media giants like Facebook and Twitter responsible for identifying them. 
Prime Minister Scott Morrison, whose conservative coalition government faces an election in the first half of 2022, said the law would protect Australians from online abuse and harassment. 
“The online world should not be a wild west where bots and bigots and trolls and others can just anonymously go around and harm people and hurt people, harass them and bully them and sledge them,” Morrison told reporters. 
“That is not what can happen in the real world, and there is no case for it to be able to be happening in the digital world.” 
Attorney General Michaelia Cash said the legislation, reportedly to be introduced to parliament by early 2022, was needed to clarify that the social media platforms, and not the users, were responsible for defamatory comments by other people. 

Attorney general says legislation is needed to clarify that social media platforms, and not the users, are responsible for defamatory comments 

Confusion had been sown by a High Court ruling in September that found Australian media, as users managing their own pages on a social network, could be held liable for defamatory third-party comments posted on their pages, Cash said. 
Under the planned Australian legislation, the social media companies themselves would be responsible for such defamatory content, not the users, she said. 
It would also aim to stop people making defamatory comments without being identified, she said. 
“You should not be able to use the cloak of online anonymity to spread your vile, defamatory comments,” the attorney general said. 
The legislation would demand that social media platforms have a nominated entity based in Australia, she said. 
The platforms could defend themselves from being sued as the publisher of defamatory comment only if they complied with the new legislation’s demands to have a complaints system in place that could provide the details of the person making the comment, if necessary, Cash said. 
People would also be able to apply to the High Court for an “information disclosure order” demanding a social media service provide details “to unmask the troll”, the attorney general said. 
In some cases, she said, the “troll” may be asked to take down the comment, which could end the matter if the other side is satisfied. 
Australia’s opposition leader Anthony Albanese said he would support a safer online environment for everyone. 
But he said the government had failed to propose action to stop the spread of misinformation on social media and accused some of the government’s own members of spreading misinformation about Covid and vaccinations.

1,New Covid variant shuts borders across the globe,"Dubbed Omicron, the strain is highly infectious","THE HAGUE: A new, heavily mutated Covid-19 variant spread across the globe on Sunday, shutting borders, renewing curbs, and sparking fears for the fight against the nearly two-year-old coronavirus pandemic.
Dubbed Omicron, the strain has cast doubt on global efforts to battle the pandemic because of fears that it is highly infectious, forcing countries to re-impose measures many had hoped were a thing of the past.
Dutch health authorities said they had identified at least 13 cases of Omicron among 61 quarantined passengers who tested positive for coronavirus after arriving from South Africa.
“The investigation has not yet been completed. The new variant may be found in more test samples,” the National Institute for Public Health warned.
Despite the alarm, in Austria tens of thousands rallied to protest against the government’s introduction of compulsory vaccination -- the first EU country to do so.

Dubbed Omicron, the strain is highly infectious

Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said it was “a minor interference” compared to the alternative for a country with one of the lowest vaccination rates in Western Europe.
With many European nations, including Germany and France, already bringing back curbs to counter surges in infections, Swiss voters broadly backed a proposed Covid pass law in a referendum on Sunday.
In Britain, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said new Covid rules will be enforced from Tuesday. 
Mask-wearing will again be mandatory in shops and on public transport in England. All passengers arriving in Britain will have to take a PCR test and self-isolate until negative.
Scientists are racing to determine the threat posed by the heavily mutated strain -- particularly whether it can evade existing vaccines. 
But a long list of countries have already imposed travel restrictions on southern Africa, where it was first detected, including key travel hub Qatar, the United States, Britain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the Netherlands.
Angola became the first southern African country to suspend all flights from its regional neighbours Mozambique, Namibia and South Africa.
Very dangerous
Israel announced some of the strictest curbs, closing the borders to all foreigners -- just four weeks after reopening to tourists following a prolonged closure due to Covid.
“We are raising a red flag,” Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said. Ten million PCR test kits would be ordered to stem the “very dangerous” strain.
Israeli citizens will be required to present a negative PCR test and quarantine for three days if they have been vaccinated against the coronavirus and seven days if they have not.
But the virus strain has already slipped through the net, and has now been found everywhere from the Netherlands to Hong Kong and Australia, where authorities on Sunday said they had detected it for the first time in two passengers from southern Africa who were tested after flying into Sydney.
The arrival of the new variant comes just a month after Australia lifted a ban on travelling overseas without permission.
Denmark confirmed its first Omicron infections, in two passengers who arrived on a flight from South Africa.
The speed at which governments slammed their borders shut took many by surprise, with travellers thronging Johannesburg international airport, desperate to squeeze onto the last flights to countries that had imposed sudden travel bans.
In Amsterdam, 61 passengers tested positive after arriving on two flights from South Africa in an ordeal one passenger described as “Dystopia Central Airline Hallway”.
New York Times global health reporter Stephanie Nolen said passengers, including babies and toddlers, were crammed together waiting to get tested, and “still 30 per cent of people are wearing no mask or only over mouth”.
Blame game 
Scientists in South Africa said they had last week detected the new B.1.1.529 variant with at least 10 mutations, compared with three for Beta or two for Delta — the strain that hit the global recovery hard and sent millions worldwide back into lockdown.
The variant has also revived geopolitical fault lines exacerbated by the pandemic, with the US quick to hail South Africa’s transparency — a thinly veiled jab at China’s handling of information about the original outbreak.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday “praised South Africa’s scientists for the quick identification of the Omicron variant and South Africa’s government for its transparency in sharing this information, which should serve as a model for the world”.
South Africa had complained it was being unfairly hit with “draconian” air travel bans for having first detected the strain, which the World Health Organisation considers a “variant of concern”.

2,Teen Hatti: A tale in fire,"“We flung infants and children out like dead animals to save them but goats and poultry could not be rescued,"" says flower seller.","LAST week, a vast shanty settlement beside the Lyari river and under Teen Hatti bridge was a plateau of fire. This was one of three large-scale casualties in a blitz of flames across Karachi. Estimates from the Nazimabad fire department say that over 100 shacks went up in smoke. But the state of this community presents a grislier picture. In an expanse of approximately 360 hutments — a figure from the area’s councilor, Chaman — not one is unscathed. 
The first few rows of 50 white cotton tents stamped by the Sindh government stitch up an apocalyptic image. Distributed by the city administrator from the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Murtaza Wahab, they stand among charred remains to set the stage for another inferno.
Frightened residents recall waking up to flames on Saturday. Opaque smoke choked the air and their throats, as fire roared through rows upon rows of cloth, plastic and plywood hovels like a contagion. Each dweller is more desperate than the other to show that all they had is now lost. Scorched cloth, broken bangles and medicine bottles, black bricks, oil lamps, petals, memories of goats, hens and savings are dark outlines of the fateful morning and of the firestorm last year.
“We flung infants and children out like dead animals to save them but goats and poultry could not be rescued. It was as dark as night. We couldn’t see the children or the road,” remembers Shankar, a flower seller.
“What should we do with charity such as clothes and bags of ration when wood is so costly and most of us don’t even have a blanket over our heads,” says an angry Ajay, a stage decorator.
Left out to defy the assault of the sun and winter dew, their children are listless. “They have cough and fever. We can’t go to a doctor or give them warm food. Our work has come to a halt. The women here make garlands and gajras, and the men go to fish and flower markets or work as labourers,” says Purkhi, a mother of four.
When asked whether medical aid, food and documentation desks were set up for them, vice president of the PPP’s unit in the area, Amanullah, has a bleak view. “Someone should have died. When everyone survives, there is no help. Last year, there was aid, money and desks. They come here for votes. But most of us have lost our national identity cards to the fire. Assistant Commissioner Sana Tariq and Murtaza Wahab brought 50 tents, 200 blankets and 50 sacks of ration. Now we have to fend for ourselves.” 
A portly 80-year-old Pathan on a crutch makes anxious attempts to wade through the crowd and Amanullah pulls him in. “I am the only one who got burnt,” says Rasool Bux. Wrapped in bandages, he tilts his face. Despite his singed cheek, neck, hair, head and arms, Bux is uncounted. 
“I am old with a bad leg so the fire got me. These boys carried me out and took me to hospital. Why don’t they give us safe, concrete houses here?” 
The UN-Habitat 2003 report, known as the most competent work on the condition of global slums, declares “the extent to which fires pose a threat to the poorest demographic of society is inadequately documented and poorly understood, particularly in Asia, home to the largest number of the world’s slum dwellers.”
However, the situation of informal settlements and their hazards casts an intense shadow of doubt in Karachi. A survey of figures gathered from fire stations in the metropolis last year reveals that 2,000 incidents of fire were reported with 246 in January and 260 in February. Five of the 2,000 instances were recognised as ‘third degree fires’.

Claims of an officer at a central fire station, Inayatullah, support the dismal numbers. “These incidents rise in the dry winter months,” he says.
The slum is represented by the Muttahida Qaumi Movement -Pakistan (MQM-P) in the Sindh Assembly, but the city’s indigenous secular party is faceless in this calamity. 
MQM-P lawmaker Mangla Sharma says: “Sindh government wants to create an urban forest along the Lyari river. Therefore, the cause of fire is unknown. This was a public declaration from PPP’s Nasir Shah. Unlike in the past, we do not have the funds to provide relief and want to build pressure in the assembly.” 
Clearly, a threat of eviction to the marginalised and most vulnerable section of society is far from a solution. An awareness drive, fireproof tents, sanitation, compensation, access to firefighters and designated escape routes are unlikely to dent PPP or MQM-P coffers, whereas a sprinkler system is a lofty ideal. The two political outfits can also consider a cost-effective inspiration in the regional neighbourhood. In 2019, Dhaka fought fire with an early warning alarm system from South Africa. Lumkani, a detection mechanism, is currently in use in the city’s slums, ensuring swift community action.
In a landscape of incinerated homes and livelihoods, traces such as Shankar’s lone parrot in a cage, Ganga’s diya’s, Rasool Bux’s scars, will serve as markers of salvaged survival and dissent for both parties, especially the MQM-P. Karachi’s populace has learnt to collect absences. For this reason, a poll dole is not its preferred reparation for abandonment.

3,"EU, Nato  vow action over migrant crisis, Russian build-up",Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg calls on Russia to “de-escalate” its military build-up on the border with Ukraine.,"VILNIUS: European Union and Nato leaders on Sunday vowed to counter “hybrid threats” during visits to Lithuania and Latvia dominated by the Belarus migrant crisis and Russia’s military build-up near Ukraine.
Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also repeated his call on Russia to “de-escalate” its military build-up on the border with Ukraine and warned of “consequences” if it used force.
The visit by Stoltenberg and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen came ahead of a meeting of Nato foreign ministers, including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in Latvia this week.
Stoltenberg and von der Leyen both accused Belarus of orchestrating the migrant crisis on its border as a “hybrid” threat against the European Union — a charge that the regime has denied. A hybrid threat is a security challenge combining traditional military means and non-military tactics such as disinformation.
“To respond to such events, it is important that the European Union and Nato work hand in hand,” von der Leyen said at a joint news conference with Stoltenberg and Lithuanian leaders in Vilnius.
Stoltenberg said: “We discussed how we could step up our joint work between Nato and the EU”.
Von der Leyen said the EU had decided to triple to $226 million its funding for border management in Latvia, Lithuania and Poland for 2021 and 2022.
She said the money would go on patrol vehicles and electronic surveillance, including drones.
Thousands of migrants — mostly from the Middle East — have crossed or tried to cross the Belarus border in recent months into the eastern members of the EU and Nato: Latvia, Lithuania and Poland.
Referring to the situation on the Belarus border, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said that “if the security situation gets even worse, we do not rule out consultations under Nato’s Article 4”.
Under the article in Nato’s founding treaty, any member can convene a meeting of the alliance to consult when it feels its security threatened. Poland has also said it may invoke this article.
The two-day meeting of Nato foreign ministers starting in Latvia on Tuesday is also expected to address Russia’s military build-up near Ukraine.
Stoltenberg said the “unusual” build-up of tanks, artillery, drones and thousands of combat-ready troops was “very concerning for many reasons”, also “because it is unprovoked and unexplained”.
“The message to Russia is that they should de-escalate, reduce tensions and be transparent” he said, adding that  “if they decide to use force, then of course, there will be consequences”.
“We stand ready to defend all our allies and we will continue to provide our partner Ukraine with political and practical support,” he said.

4,UAE to introduce new criminal code in January,Media statement clarifies the status of pre-marital relations and children born from them,"DUBAI: The United Arab Emirates has said a new criminal code would come into force in January as part of what it called the most sweeping legal reform in the Gulf state’s history. 
State news agency WAM reported on Saturday the government is changing 40 laws. It did not make clear, however, which of the changes — that concern commercial companies, online security, trade, copyright, residency, narcotics and social issues — were new and which had been previously reported. 
One change that appears new is the ratification of a Federal Crime and Punishment Law, effective from Jan 2, 2022, designed to better protect women, domestic staff and public safety. 
Saturday’s statement adds clarity that had been previously lacking to the status of pre-marital sexual relations and children born from them — stating that parents need not be married. 
“Any couple conceiving a child out of wedlock will be required to marry or singly or jointly acknowledge the child and provide identification papers and travel documents in accordance with the laws of the country of which either is a national,” the statement said. 

Media statement clarifies the status of pre-marital relations and children born from them

A criminal case with two years imprisonment would be brought should parents not acknowledge and care for the child. 
The UAE wants to reform its legal system to keep a competitive edge as conservative Gulf neighbour Saudi Arabia opens itself up to foreign investment and talent. 
Major changes so far included decriminalising pre-marital sexual relations and alcohol consumption, and cancelling provisions for leniency when dealing with so-called  “honour killings” in November 2020. 
Other recent changes by the UAE include introducing longer-term visas as a way to attract and retain talent and encourage more businesses to set up shop. 
The emirate of Abu Dhabi this month introduced its own reform — a novel secular family law aimed at making itself more attractive to expatriates.
