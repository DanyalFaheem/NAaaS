A senior official of the RDA told Dawn that a joint team of District Land Revenue Department and RDA’s land and engineering branches had been formed which started work to mark land to be acquired for the project.
He said Leh Nullah was divided into city and cantonment areas and the team would complete demarcation of cantonment land in the first phase. He said in the second phase, the team would identify land in the jurisdiction of Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation.
“Rawalpindi Municipal Waste Company transfer station in Liaquat Bagh will also be affected due to the project and it would be relocated,” he said, adding the RDA had asked all civic bodies to calculate estimates and send them to it.

Cantonment land to be marked in first phase, RDA official says

He said under the law, cantonment boards of Rawalpindi and Chaklala would inform about structures in their areas and get approval from Military Lands and Cantonments about the military land.
He said the provincial government would pay the price of structures only on leased property in cantonment areas while land price would be paid to private landowners along the Leh Nullah.
On the other hand, RDA asked Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) to shift its supply lines and tubewells along Leh Nullah and after demarcation of land Wasa would start a survey of the area.
He said Wasa had installed more than two dozen tubewells along Leh Nullah from New Kattarian to Lahore High Court Rawalpindi bench building near Soan River, adding it would get time and money from the government and after installation of new tubewells supply lines will be relocated.
Another official of RDA said after demarcation of land, the civic bodies would submit details of land price and government structures; the district administration will then verify it from land records after which it would become part of the PC-I.
He said the price committee would also fix rates of land along the nullah and would inform people about the rates in different areas.
He added that the process would be completed in a month and then the land acquisition process would be started. Private landowners would also be contacted and in this regard RDA already has sent notices to house owners along the nullah.
When contacted, RDA Director Anwar Baran said the final assessment would be done after completion of demarcation.

The team is expected to stay in the country till Dec 10.
An ICAO team has arrived in Pakistan for a safety audit of the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority which will start on Monday, sources said.
The team comprises nine members out of whom eight arrived in Karachi on Saturday while one will join them next week, the sources said.
Mr Khan said the ICAO team would conduct audits of different areas, including security, pilot licensing, training, and wherever it had expressed concerns previously.
“The Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA) has addressed all of the ICAO’s concerns, including improvement of issuance of pilot licences and security,” the minister told Dawn.
He expressed the hope that the PCAA would get a positive response and flights to European countries would resume, adding the aviation authority had also improved the pilot licensing procedure and addressed other concerns of the ICAO.
The minister said the federal cabinet had previously approved collaboration with the UK Civil Aviation Authority to improve and strengthen pilot licences.
Earlier, the ICAO had planned the universal safety oversight audit programme (USOAP) and the continuous monitoring approach (CMA) in Pakistan from July 5 to 15, 2021, which had been accepted by Pakistan.
Later, the ICAO decided to postpone the audit based on the fact that the Covid-19 situation did not improve as initially expected.
The PCAA had offered to the ICAO that it would share with it the concerned data online to avoid postponement of their visit in July. 
The ICAO had been requested not to postpone the visit of its team. The team, which comprised citizens of different nationalities, had been assured that all the PCAA officials coordinating with them during their visit would be vaccinated against Covid-19.
During their current visit, the ICAO team members will also visit Islamabad and Lahore and will hold talks with senior officials of the Aviation Division. The team will also audit airworthiness of aircraft, aerodromes and ground aids, the aviation aircraft accident investigation board and the engineering department.

2,PML-N bought votes for upcoming by-polls in Lahore: Fawad Chaudhry,Claims PML-N had similarly lured voters during the 2016 by-election in Jhelum.,"GUJAR KHAN: Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry on Sunday said those who chant “Vote ko izzat do” (give respect to vote) slogan bought votes for Rs2,000 for the upcoming by-election in Lahore.
He was referring to a viral video in which PML-N workers allegedly distributed cash among people for votes in a constituency of Lahore. 
Addressing a public gathering in Pind Dadan Khan, the minister said PML-N had similarly lured voters during the 2016 by-election in Jhelum and this was the system against which Imran Khan had taken a stand.
“I hope that when the offices of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) would open on Monday, they would take notice of the matter and would ask the PML-N how getting votes by distributing money was service to democracy and giving respect to the ballot.”
The minister said when the PTI government wanted to use electronic voting machines (EVMs) in the next general elections the PML-N and PPP felt perturbed because these people came to power through a ‘specific system’ and their whole election system was based on rigging.
Advising PML-N leader Maryam Nawaz and her husband retired Captain Mohammad Safdar, the minister said they should bid adieu to politics, adding that whenever their case was about to be heard in courts, they leaked fake videos to pressure judges and state institutions.
“Maryam Nawaz had said she did not own any property in London and even in Pakistan but after Panama Leaks we came to know that she owned property worth billions not only in Pakistan but also abroad. We repeatedly ask them to show receipts else there are only two options: to return the money or go to jail,” Mr Chaudhry said.
He said the PTI would not only complete its five-year term but also win the next elections. 
Moreover, the minister told his party workers from his constituency to keep their focus on the upcoming local government elections and not to worry about the general elections.
Meanwhile, Mr Chaudhry visited the under-construction Phase III of the Jalalpur Sharif canal and attended the groundbreaking ceremony of a trauma centre in the Basic Health Unit in Tobah village of Pind Dadan Khan. An amount of Rs310 million has been approved for the construction of the trauma centre.

The resolution also stated that Pakistan should not hold talks with India until its troops stopped shedding blood of the Kashmiris.
India abrogated the special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 on August 5, 2019 and bifurcated it into two union territories.
The resolution was jointly tabled by LHCBA President Sardar Abdul Razziq Advocate and other speakers including Azad and Jammu Kashmir (AJK) President Barrister Sultan Mehmood Chaudhry at the Kashmir Conference.
Kashmir Committee Chairman Shehryar Khan Afridi, Supreme Court Bar Association President Ahsan Bhon, PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb, All Parties Hurriyat Conference leader Yusaf Nasim, PPP General Secretary Nayyar Hussain Bukhari and Jamaat-i-Islami Punjab Emir Dr Tariq Salim also attended the conference.
Speaking on the occasion, AJK President Barrister Sultan Mehmood Chaudhry said all political and religious parties were on the same page on the issue of Kashmir and wanted India to stop the genocide of Kashmiris.
He said Kashmir would soon be free from the bloody clutches of India, adding that people had started raising voices in favour of the suppressed Kashmiris even in UK, Europe and America.
Parliamentary Special Committee on Kashmir Chairman Shehryar Khan Afridi said Kashmir was the jugular vein of Pakistan and nobody could stop Kashmiris from getting their freedom from the illegal occupation of India.
“Indian troops have accelerated violence against the helpless Kashmiris after August 5,2019, which should be stopped immediately,” he said.
PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb said: “Politicians are dubbed or declared allies of Modi for raising the issue of Kashmir.”
She said the core issue of Kashmir could not be resolved by naming roads, adding that nobody could snatch Kashmir from Pakistan.
She said the present government should be held accountable and answer questions. “Why did India take action against Kashmir on August 9, 2019? Why no country stood with Pakistan and why did the Security Council not pass a resolution against India,” she added.
PPP leader Nayyer Hussain Bukhari said the United Nations was being occupied by a super power, adding that there were eight resolutions on Kashmir issue pending with it.
JI Punjab Emir Dr Tariq Salim said 56 Islamic states were doing nothing for the freedom of Kashmir.

9,35pc work on Rawal Dam Interchange complete: CDA,ISLAMABAD: Around 35 per cent work on the Rawal Dam Interchange has been completed and the project is expected to be...,"ISLAMABAD: Around 35 per cent work on the Rawal Dam Interchange has been completed and the project is expected to be completed by October 2022. 
This was mentioned by officials of the Capital Development Authority (CDA). Inaugurated in July last year, the project worth Rs1.1 billion was delayed for a few months before work on it formally started in October last year with two years of completion time.
The officials said shifting of utility service lines took many months that caused slow progress initially, adding that base work always took time and now in the second year, the remaining work would be completed within the deadline.
One of the engineers claimed that CDA will try to complete the project before the deadline.
He said next month an international conference is likely to take place in Islamabad and the said road will be used as the main route for delegations, therefore, at this moment, CDA does not want to accelerate the project. From January onwards, pace of work will however be fully accelerated, he added.
The said interchange is being constructed at the junction of Murree Road, Club Road and Park Road and once completed this project will provide relief to commuters as traffic congestion on this portion of Murree Road has become common.
During the last few years, due to increasing population in adjoining areas of Margalla Town and Park Road, traffic congestion has become a problem. The road is used as the main route for residents of several housing schemes and towns including Banigala and CDA’s Park Enclave.
During the last decade or so, many educational institutions and wedding marquees have also been established in the area.
Old villages such as Lakhwal, Kurri, Chatta Bakhtawar, Shahzad Town, Rawal Town and Alipur Farash saw an increase in population that resulted in traffic load on Park Road. Besides, the said interchange project, CDA will also launch another project for beautification of the interchange by adding an arch styled bridge with lighting at the site.
An official of CDA’s planning wing said after completion of the said interchange project, the CDA would also have to expand the existing Park Road where traffic congestion had increased. He said the CDA had already launched its own three housing schemes - Park Enclave I, II and III - and now it is going to launch another one called Overseas Enclave which is also known as Park Enclave IV. To cater to future traffic we will have to expand existing Park Road as well, he said.

11,Property transfer wing reopens at Citizen Facilitation Centre today,"One-window directorate will also be fully functional after a week, says CDA chief","ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) is going to restart transfer of property operation from Monday (today) at the Citizen Facilitation Centre near Sitara Market.
Owing to shifting of the Estate Management Office and One-Window Directorate (OWD), the operation of Estate Management remained closed for a few days.
The service will resume on Monday but the OWD directorate will be fully functional after a week with proper facilities for the visitors such as seating area.
“We planned to restart the operation after one week but when I came to know that people were suffering due to the closure of the facility I ordered the restart of the operation from Monday. Meanwhile, the waiting area will be completed in a week,” said CDA Chairman Amer Ali Ahmed.
He said that under one roof the citizens would have all the facilities and would be no longer required to visit various offices for transfer of their property.

One-window directorate will also be fully functional after a week, says CDA chief

“OWD, revenue, estate management and building control directorates have been shifted to the centre so that the citizens will get their property transferred smoothly and conveniently.” 
He said in case of any complaint, strict action will be taken against the staff. He said the building control section II and III had already been shifted there and soon BCS will also start working there. 
The centre was inaugurated in 2016 aimed at providing facilities to the residents of Islamabad. Several offices such as BCS II and III, birth and death registration centre are already functioning there.
Meanwhile, sources said offices like OWD and Estate Management I, II which were now vacant in the main CDA building will be used by the land directorate and the OWD exclusively for dealing with the case of land affectees.
Land affectees are those whose land has been acquired by the CDA for development of sectors. They are entitled to get compensation in the shape of cash and plots from the CDA. However, so far, a large number of compensation cases are pending on part of the CDA.
CDA officials said cases of the affected people will be dealt in an expeditious manner.
In the past, the CDA’s land directorate remained in controversy for allotting plots of affectees in a fraudulent manner causing huge loss to the CDA. The CDA was also accused of using delaying tactics in disposing of the cases of genuine affected people and facilitating property dealers only.
Several inquiries into dubious allotments were initiated by the CDA while Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) was probing allotment of a number of plots.

In a statement, Mr Rabbani also castigated his own party’s government in Sindh for delaying the implementation of these recommendations.
“All governments must implement recommendations of the Committee of the Whole of the Senate of Pakistan and restore student unions. In particular, the government of Sindh has no excuse to delay this restoration,” Mr Rabbani said.
The PPP senator was of the view that the right of students to elect their unions was one conferred as a fundamental right under the Constitution of 1973. This right, he said, had been usurped by military dictator Gen Ziaul Haq in order to weaken the student movement to perpetuate himself and the elite in power.
Mr Rabbani said the ban on student unions had affected the growth of political parties. He expressed concern over the mysterious disappearance of the two students from Balochistan and asked the authorities concerned to immediately find them.
Mr Rabbani also called for increasing federal and provincial budgets for education.
The Senate Committee of the Whole had passed a resolution on Aug 22, 2017, calling for the revival of student unions in the country’s educational institutions.
“The student unions provide a platform for students to engage in social and educational activities and defend their rights at the same time,” said the resolution which had been read by Rabbani, who was the Senate chairman at that time.

In the federal capital, only 25 cases of Covid-19 were detected and 0.57pc positivity rate was recorded on Sunday, DHO Dr Zaeem Zia said.
As the most virulent variant of Covid-19 called Omicron has been reported in South Africa and travelled to a number of countries, the district administration on Sunday decided to keep positive cases in a quarantine centre established in I-9.
On Saturday, Pakistan put South Africa, Hong Kong, Mozambique, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini and Botswana in category C and imposed a complete ban on direct/indirect inbound travel from these countries.
Pakistani passengers travelling from those countries on extreme emergency will only be allowed after obtaining exemptions and a number of health/testing protocols. 
They will undergo a three-day mandatory home quarantine and re-RAT will be conducted on the third day by the civil administration.
RAT positive cases will undergo 10 days’ mandatory quarantine (government/self-paid) while PCR test will be conducted on the 10th day in quarantine.
However, stranded Pakistanis travelling from these countries till December 5 will be allowed without exemption but the mandatory protocols will remain applicable.
An official of the Ministry of National Health Services (NHS) said Pakistan had introduced three categories to deal with Covid-19. He said: “Countries in ‘A’ category are exempted from the mandatory Covid-19 test, travellers from ‘B’ category countries require a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test that must be taken within 72 hours of the travel date while countries in ‘C’ category are restricted and people can travel only under specific guidelines.”
Dr Zia said the quarantine centre in I-9 had been reserved for positive passengers travelling from the seven countries.
“However, some of the passengers may not be willing to stay at the facility so we have started contacting hotels to declare them quarantine centres. We cannot stop arrival of positive patients in Pakistan but will make sure that they remained in quarantine.”
