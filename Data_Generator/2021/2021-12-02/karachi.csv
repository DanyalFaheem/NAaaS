1,Sindh health dept broadens Covid-19 outreach programme,Launches drive to offer free-of-cost booster doses at all its designated vaccination centres in the province.,"KARACHI: To tackle the looming Omicron threat, the Sindh health department on Wednesday broadened its Covid-19 outreach vaccination programme and launched a drive to offer free-of-cost booster doses at all its designated centres in the province. 
In the first phase, booster doses would be offered to front-line health workers, persons with weakened immune systems and people aged above 50 years, who were fully vaccinated against coronavirus six months ago. 
“The six-month interval has been considered (internationally) as the best time for a booster dose. Those who have spent less time with full vaccination still have (enough) antibodies to fight the virus,” explained Dr Samreen Ashraf Qureshi, the provincial focal person for Covid-19 vaccination. 
The booster dose would be offered per availability of the vaccine and choice of the individual. 
“It’s completely safe to have a combination of vaccines. However, our first priority will be to offer the same vaccine (for the booster dose) that had earlier been given to the person,” Dr Qureshi said.

In a statement, the Sindh High Court Bar Association (SHCBA) condemned the brutal murder and urged the inspector general of police to take immediate measure for the arrest of the killers.
With regard to the boycott of the proceedings, the SHBCA statement said: “The Sindh High Court chief justice has ordered that no adverse orders be passed during the course of the day. However, urgent matter may be taken up.”
The chairman of the executive committee of the Sindh Bar Council, Arif Daud, also condemned the killing of its secretary and announced a province-wide boycott of court proceedings on Thursday (today).
Meanwhile, opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf lawmakers Khurram Sher Zaman and Ghaffar Bilal also attended the funeral prayer.
They told the media that their party had been raising its voice before the Sindh Assembly about worsening law and order situation in the province and had also protested before the Central Police Office over the recent targeted killing of their party leader, Sakhawat Rajput, in Kamber but to no avail.

4,MQM-P questions silence of state institutions on ‘destruction’ of urban areas,Announces a multi-party conference on 11th...,"KARACHI: The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan on Wednesday questioned the silence of state institutions on the policy of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) to ruin urban areas of Sindh and wondered as to why the Chief Justice of Pakistan was not taking a suo motu notice of the sheer violation of the Constitution by the ruling party in the province.
The MQM-P leaders in a press conference at the party’s temporary headquarters in Bahadurabad also vowed that they would no longer allow easy sailing to the ruling PPP, which was crushing every legal right of Karachiites. 
They also warned a strong reaction and protests across the province against the Sindh Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2021 calling it a war for the survival of Pakistan.

Announces a multi-party conference on 11th

“I humbly ask why the Chief Justice of Pakistan is not taking suo motu notice over this open and brutal violation of Article 140-A of the Constitution,” asked MQM-P convener Dr Khalid Maqboool Siddiqui. 
“I really want to ask the state institutions about urban Sindh. Is this unified or consensual decision of the state institutions that they will stay silent over this destruction of cities? The time is running fast and the situation is slipping out of everyone’s hands,” he warned.
He called the recently-passed amended LG bill an attempt to “encroach” upon rights of municipal administrations defying the basic rule of strong democracy and called it a reflection of the feudal mindset of the PPP, which prevailed among its leadership.
Accompanied by former Karachi mayor Wasim Akhtar, the party’s parliamentary leader in the Sindh Assembly Kanwar Naveed Jameel and Senator Faisal Subzwari, Dr Siddiqui said that the MQM-P would keep raising its voice against the PPP and its illegal moves at every legal and democratic forum while mobilising its workers and supporters for a larger movement.
“On December 11, we are organising an all-parties conference where true democratic forces of the province will share their grievances and devise a future strategy on common grounds,” he said. 
“We have tried our best to resolve the issues through dialogue and table talk, but the PPP is not ready to pay any heed. So if it [PPP] wants to decide this case in the streets, we will take to the streets and lead people against this anti-people law,” he said.

5,JI slams PPP’s LG law in citywide rallies,KARACHI: The Jamaat-i-Islami on Wednesday launched its campaign against Sindh Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2021...,"KARACHI: The Jamaat-i-Islami on Wednesday launched its campaign against Sindh Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2021 and staged protest sit-ins in over a dozen key areas of Karachi, warning that if the Pakistan Peoples Party government didn’t review its ‘anti-people and anti-democracy’ policy, the opposition party would not have any other choice, but to come up with a strong protest movement that would paralyse its governance system.  
The PPP had been pursuing a policy only to strengthen its rule ‘illegally’, JI leaders said.  
Major power shows held mainly on M. A. Jinnah Road, Sharea Faisal, North Karachi, Federal B Area, Hyderi Market in North Nazimabad, Orangi Town, Hassan Square and Sabzi Mandi, Korangi and Quaidabad areas where a large number of party leaders, workers and supporters gathered to show anger against the PPP government and its local government law.  
At a sit-in staged outside the KMC head office on main M. A. Jinnah Road, JI Karachi chief Hafiz Naeem ur Rehman while addressing the protesters called the proposed law, which still needs the Sindh governor’s approval, an ‘ambush’ on the rights of Karachi.  
“The Jamaat-i-Islami will mobilise masses and resist the illegal bill on all available forums,” he said.  
“The people of Karachi will not accept any illegal move in the name of legislation that violates the constitution, undermines the authority of local government and usurps the rights of Karachiites. It’s an anti-constitutional attitude of the PPP government in Sindh. The proposed bill was passed by the PPP totally in violation of the constitution of Pakistan’s Article 32 and Article 140-A.” 
He said that the JI would observe black day on Friday and build a momentum for its power show on December 12.  
A protest march titled ‘Save Karachi March’ would be held which would be attended by ‘prominent’ individuals from all walks of life.  
“The PPP has become a party of feudal lords. So it is time for every true democratic force and individual to come out of home and raise their voice for their rights,” added Hafiz Naeem.

6,PSP moves court against recently passed bill,KARACHI: The Pak Sarzameen Party (PSP) on Wednesday filed a petition in the Sindh High Court (SHC) against a bill...,"KARACHI: The Pak Sarzameen Party (PSP) on Wednesday filed a petition in the Sindh High Court (SHC) against a bill recently passed by the provincial assembly to amend the Sindh Local Government Act (SLGA) of 2013 and sought a restraining order for the provincial authorities not to enact it as an Act.
PSP leaders Arshad Vohra and Syed Hafeezuddin through their counsel petitioned the SHC stating that the Sindh Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2021 passed to make changes in the SLGA 2013 was in violation of Articles 7, 8, 32 & 140-A of the Constitution. 
While citing the Sindh chief minister, chief secretary, provincial assembly speaker and the Sindh LG minister and secretary as respondents, the petitioners argued that the bill was now pending for the approval with the governor of Sindh and if provided, it would become the part of the SLGA 2013 and the citizens would be deprived all of their rights as envisaged under Article 8. 
They maintained that instead of devolving the powers to elected representatives of the local government, the respondents grabbed all the functions and duties of the local government by passing such a bill despite the fact that Articles 7 and 140-A very clearly defined the meaning of the state and local government. 
The petitioner also asserted that the bill was prejudice for the entire province and especially for Karachi, Hyderabad and other urban areas of Sindh as the amendment in Section 140-A (Power of Government to Amend Schedules) said, “Notwithstanding anything contained in this act, the government shall have power to amend, alter, add or remove any entries from the schedules, by notification and the official gazette”. 
“Through the amendment, the respondents had taken absolute rights over the province to make changes in the law unilaterally and as absolute authority,” their petition said.
They pleaded to issue a restraining order for the respondents from the enactment and promulgation of the bill in question as an act and subsequent amendment in the SLGA 2013.

In Hyderabad, Progressive Students Federation staged a demonstration outside local press club. The protester’s leaders Darya Khan Chandio, Sanjha Channa, Ansar Buriro and others said that educational institutions had become torture cells for students, especially girls.
They said that after Naila Rind and Dr Nimrata, the body of Nosheen Kazmi was found in the college in Larkana. It was regrettable that another young student had died in mysterious circumstances. Each time the death was described as suicide even before a formal investigation, they said.
They said that there was always some motive behind the killings. 
They said the Sindh University students were issued show-cause notice and some were booked for observing Sindh cultural day. The FIR was lodged against students of Sindh Agriculture University Tandojam which was condemnable, they said.
They demanded the authorities bring culprits in Nosheen to justice and the show-cause notices issued to students and FIR lodged against them in Tandojam be withdrawn.

9,SHC suspends notification for removal of Hesco CEO,HYDERABAD: Sindh High Court’s principal seat in Karachi on Wednesday suspended till Dec 22 the operation of ...,"HYDERABAD: Sindh High Court’s principal seat in Karachi on Wednesday suspended till Dec 22 the operation of federal energy ministry’s Nov 26 notification for the removal of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (Hesco) Rehan Hamid.
A single bench of Justice Zulfiqar Ahmed Khan passed the order on a constitutional petition filed by Mr Hamid through Rafiq Ahmed Kalwar advocate, and noted that the petitioner’s counsel had submitted that his client was appointed as CEO in June 2021. 
He said the federal ministry (power division) had issued the impugned notification to remove Mr Hamid who had applied for post of CEO in response to an advertisement by chairman of the Board of Directors (BoD) Hesco in January 2021 and the BoD had recommended his appointment for three years on June 1, 2021. 
He said that as per agreement, only Hesco had authority to terminate the CEO’s employment in case of reasons as mentioned in clause 10 of the Employment Agreement. 
On Nov 4, the petitioner applied to the BoD for leave to attend wedding of his daughter in Canada and the leave, starting from Nov 8, was approved, he said.
But to his dismay he learnt that he was removed as Hesco CEO by the ministry through a notification on Nov 26 without giving any reason and replaced with Noor Ahmed Soomro as CEO under another notification, he said.
He said the impugned notifications were totally ultra vires. Hesco alone was competent authority to terminate his services in case of breach of agreement, conviction or acts falling within the definition of moral turpitude but in the instant case he was performing duties to the satisfaction of BoD thus there was no reason warranting the termination under clause 10 of the agreement, he said.
He said that acts of the defendant ministry were in violation of Section 24-A of General Clauses Act, 1987, which provided that an authority vested with power was bound to exercise the same justly, fairly, reasonably and for the advancement of purpose being vested therein.
He said the impugned notifications were in violation of Article 9 of the Constitution which ensured security of a person that could not be envisaged in an environment of lawlessness, unfairness and exploitation as was being created by the defendants. 
He said that no reason was mentioned in the impugned notifications of his termination and urged the court to declare the Nov 26 notifications as ultra vires, beyond authority and jurisdiction of the ministry. He should, therefore, be granted ad interim relief by suspending the two notifications, he said.
The counsel said that Hesco was one of distribution companies regulated by its own constitution. It was lately incorporated as a Limited Liability Company governed by a BoD of which only three directors came from government sector. This mechanism had been set up to bring efficiency to the system, he said.
He contended that such abrupt termination was in violation of the petitioner’s contract of service, Public Sector Guidelines, 2015 and provisions of Companies Act and it was on the face of it mala fide. 
According to him, the bench issued notices to defendants and attorney general to appear in court on Dec 22 while suspending operation of the impugned notifications.

The division bench comprising Justices Mohammad Iqbal Kalhoro and Amjad Ali Sahito made the observation while hearing a petition filed by Ghulam Parwar Abro, the employee who was accused of harassment. However, the proposed final action, if any, would be subject to outcome of this petition, said the bench. 
The court fixed the case for hearing on Dec 7 while issuing notices to respondents and additional advocate general Sindh. 
The petitioner, who appeared in person to plead his case, said he had been issued a final show-cause notice after an inquiry into allegations of harassment.
The petitioner was admonished by Justice Kalhoro for filing petitions against the university every now and then. “You are habitual in filing petitions against universities and you want to get salary for doing nothing,” said Justice Kalhoro.
The petitioner said the inquiry was initiated against him on an anonymous application to which the court said “you want the girl to come forward so that her future is destroyed. 
The university is not required to disclose her identity. You have been issued final show cause notice and given statement of allegations as well,” said the judge. 
The petitioner requested fair trial and said the inquiry be conducted by police but the court disagreed and said the university authorities would be given one week’s time to respond to the petition. He did not have answer to queries raised by the court. 
Mr Sundar, who appeared on behalf of Mehran University, told the bench that it was the fourth petition by the petitioner against the university. He was referring to the petitioner’s past petitions against deputation and out-of-turn promotions in universities.
The petitioner cited acting vice chancellor of Shaheed Allah Bukhsh Soomro University of Art, Design and Heritages Jamshoro, acting registrar, convener inquiry committee of the university, Zulqarnain Bhutto, secretary of the inquiry committee as respondents in his petition.
He claimed that he had been suspended since he had challenged appointments on deputation and out of turn promotions. Allegations against him were not proved, he said. 
He claimed the respondent university officers including acting VC were harassing him and they issued final show-cause notices which were suspended earlier by the court. He had filed three petitions against illegalities and alleged malpractices by retired director, respondent acting VC of arts university, Bhai Khan Shar. 
The acting VC issued him show-cause notice on Nov 25 and asked him to appear in person to which he had replied but he was again issued a show-cause notice on Nov 26. 
He said a similar fake compliant against was filed with SSP Women Harassment Cell Jamshoro and prayed the court to set aside orders of March 4 and Nov 25 issued by the acting VC and order a law enforcement agency to carry out an impartial inquiry into allegations against him. 
He said the respondents should be restrained from taking any coercive action against him.

SSP Ahmed is the second investigating officer of the case in which former Malir SSP Rao Anwar and his around two dozen subordinates have been charged with killing four persons — Naqeeb Mehsud, Sabir, Nazar Jan and Ishaq — after dubbing them ‘Taliban militants’ in a ‘fake’ encounter on Jan 13, 2018.
The matter came up recently before the ATC-III judge, who is conducting the trial inside the judicial complex inside the central prison, for recording testimony of SSP Ahmed. However, he said that he had received the court’s notice very late and could not prepare himself to record his statement. He requested the judge to grant him time so that he could come prepared for recording his testimony.
Objecting to his request, Rao Anwar’s counsel Amir Mansoob Qureshi said the witness was an educated officer, thus his request to record a written statement was against the law.
The judge granted time to Dr Rizwan till Dec 2 to come prepared for recording his testimony in the case and adjourned the hearing.

“The anti-encroachment operation from Karachi to Kashmore will temporarily be suspended. The Sindh government has prepared an ordinance to stop the anti-encroachment operation,” he told a press conference.
Barrister Wahab, who is also the spokesperson for the provincial government as well as the administrator of Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, said that a commission would be set up under the ordinance to determine which non-commercial structures must not be demolished.
He said that the PPP drafted the ordinance and sent it to the governor. “The governor will approve the draft of the ordinance,” he said, claiming that the ordinance was made purely in the interest of the citizens.
He said that a retired judge would be the head of the proposed commission that would decide whether to regularise the construction or not. “We will also get the ordinance passed by the assembly,” he said.
He said that the law was the same in Sindh as it was in Punjab but only a paragraph was added that the anti-encroachment drive should be stopped immediately.
‘Consequences of land commercialisation’
As for the commercialisation of land, he said that it started in the tenure of former Karachi mayor Naimatullah Khan. 
“When the citizens approached the courts against it [commercialisation], it was decided [by the court] that it is the prerogative of the [then] city government,” he added.
He said that several areas were commercialised and the consequences of that decision were being felt today.
“This problem has spread all over Pakistan. Societies have been formed on agricultural land in Islamabad. It is asked that a building [Nasla Tower] is being demolished [in Karachi] but why it is not happening in Banigala in Islamabad,” he added.
He said that the Pakistan Peoples Party passed a resolution in the Sindh Assembly on the issue of the anti-encroachment drive and urged the need for legislation so as to reduce miseries of the citizens. 
He said that those who held press conferences on the issue of Nasla Tower had ‘escaped’ from the Sindh Assembly.
The Karachi administrator said that action should be taken against the encroachments on drains.
‘SBCA gave permission for Nasla Tower’
In a reply to a question, he said that the provincial government did not allot land for Nasla Tower as the Sindhi Muslim Society was not under its administrative control. “This property was commercialised in 2007 at that time Mustafa Kamal was the city nazim,” he said.
Barrister Wahab said that after commercialisation, the Sindh Building Control Authority gave permission for the construction of Nasla Tower. “The land actually belonged to KMC and in 2000 the court ruled that the land was given to Sindhi Muslim Society in exchange for money,” he said.
He also asked Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan convener Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui to stop the politics of ‘segregation’.
He also condemned the killing of office secretary of the Sindh Bar Council Irfan Mahar and said that the killers would be arrested at the earliest.

15,"DHA not providing land allotment, reclamation data, SHC told",The bench gives two weeks to the authority to furnish requisite documents.,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Wednesday directed the Defence Housing Authority to provide record and documents of all the land allotted including the land reclaimed from the sea after the official assignee complained that the DHA was not willing to provide the requisite data.
A single-judge SHC bench headed by Justice Zulfiqar Ahmad Khan also issued notices to the DHA, Cantonment Board Clifton, Cantonment Board Faisal, Cantonment Board Malir, Karachi Cantonment Board and others for Dec 15 on an application seeking contempt proceedings against them for not complying with the court’s earlier order restraining them not to use the land sanctioned as public spaces for any commercial and gainful purposes and also not to create a third-party interest.
It also directed the DHA to share the record of the land allotted for other projects and further ordered the Civil Aviation Authority and Port Qasim Authority to provide the record of commercial properties and reclaimed land, respectively.
The bench also asked the Sindh government to appoint focal persons to supply relevant information to the official assignee about ownership and possession of the reclaimed land.
When the bench took up for hearing a suit, filed by six plaintiffs who approached the court under the Whistleblower Protection and Vigilance Commission Ordinance, Official Assignee Dr Chaudary Wasim Iqbal filed his interim report in compliance with an earlier order about inspection of the reclaimed land and to provide details of commercial places of 22 private entities.

The bench gives two weeks to the authority to furnish requisite documents

The report said that the official assignee had issued notices to the DHA and other defendants to provide the required record and documents and also to appoint focal persons for carrying out compliance within stipulated period.
However, the report said that it appeared from the stance taken by the DHA’s law officer that perhaps DHA had been deliberately avoiding to produce the documents while the plaintiffs had provided a copy of the master plan of 1973 regarding the initial allotment of the land to DHA.
The official assignee asked the DHA law officer that without having record of the initial allotment, the identification of dimension of reclaimed land was not possible.
He stated that architect Marvi Mazhar came to volunteer her service about the reclaimed land and to sketch the dimensions and she was requested to provide aerial mapping of the reclaimed land, it added.
The report stated that besides inspecting six properties in DHA, other officials from the office of the official assignee also inspected some sites — Falcon Mall, PAF Museum, The Venue, The Signature and Imperial Wedding Halls — under the control of military estate office and Pakistan Air Force on Nov 29. 
The squadron leader, PAF Base Faisal, submitted a reply of the official assignee’s letter and was of the view that no commercial activity was being carried out under the command management of the PAF base while all commercial activities on the site of under-construction Falcon Mall had been ceased in the light of the Supreme Court order and the signboards depicting the mall were also removed, it added.
The report also stated that the Karachi Urban Lab (KUL) informed that it had no resources to undertake this task while the National Institute of Oceanography Pakistan (NIOP) replied that nobody ever contacted it to conduct scientific research with regard to the process of reclaimed land from shore in Karachi.
The official assignee requested the bench to direct the DHA to provide documents of the land initially allotted in its favour and details of all other land subsequently came in their occupation by way of reclaimed land either arrived out by itself or by any other federal and provincial department.
He also sought directive for DHA to share the title deed of reclaimed land in its occupation besides the land sold out to other companies. 
The bench allowed the requests of the official assignee and adjourned the matter till Dec 15.
On Oct 23, the bench had directed the DHA and other official defendants to ensure that the land earlier sanctioned to them as public spaces was not used for any commercial and gainful purposes till the next hearing of the case and ordered an official assignee to inspect the reclaimed land being used by the DHA and furnish a report with photographs and maps of the land with the assistance of KUL or NIOP.
It had also restrained DHA from reclaiming further land and granting such land to anyone as well as creating third party interest.

16,Dried fruit prices register massive increase in Karachi,Local pushcart vendors are demanding Rs170-180 for just 250 grammes of peanuts as compared to Rs140-150 rate of last year.,"KARACHI: The price of peanuts, one of the main attractions of the winter season, has gone up while most dried fruits have totally gone out of reach of the common man with advent of slight cold weather conditions in the city. 
Local pushcart vendors are demanding Rs170-180 for just 250 grams of peanuts as compared to Rs140-150 rate of last year. 
Vendors start tolling pushcart bells in residential areas from the last weeks of October, signalling the arrival of winter. 
It is a fact that people of all age groups enjoy munching on peanuts, but with the sky-rocketing prices, a majority of consumers are having second thoughts when they ask prices of peanuts from any pushcart vendor. 
The price of best quality Parachinar peanut and the almost similar in appearance but lower in quality peanut varieties of Sukkur and Punjab have also gone phenomenally up. 

Only chilghoza price has come down to Rs5,800-Rs6,500 a kilo against Rs7,000-8,000 last year

Retailers said this year the rate of Punjab’s peanut was Rs11,000 per 40kg, which was Rs8,000 last year, while Sukkur variety cost Rs7,500 per 40kg, which was selling at Rs6,500 last year. 
The prices of other dried fruits have also increased as compared to the last year’s prices. 
However, only pine nuts (chilghoza) price has come down a bit which cost between Rs5,800-Rs6,500 as against Rs7,000-8,000 per kilo rate of last year. 
Jump in import
While the retail dried-fruit sellers show a gloomy sale picture as compared to 2020, their claims prove a bit misguiding in view of the thriving consumption based on substantial jump in legal imports from July 2020 to October 2021, according to official figures. 
During July-October 2021, imports reached to 26,340 tonnes ($18 million) ahead of peak winter season from 20,284 tonnes ($25m) in the same period last fiscal, depicting a drop of average per tonne price to $689 from $1,228 while the rupee lost its value by 7.6 per cent against the dollar in the same period. 
From July 2020 till November 2021, rupee lost its value by over 11.4pc against the dollar. 
In 2020-2021, imports of dried fruit posted a whopping growth of 129pc in terms of value and 251pc in volume to $78mn and 78,042 tonnes, respectively, as compared to 22,226 tonnes valuing $34mn in 2019-2020. 
The average per tonne price fell to $1,004 from $1,540. 
The drop in dried fruit prices in the world market has also diluted the negative impact of falling rupee against the dollar from Rs152-153 in May 2021 to current rate of Rs175 in the interbank market. 
Despite massive decline in world market rates and thriving legal imports, consumers are still finding it difficult to purchase dried fruit. 
Main dried fruit prices
For example, almond price has shot up to Rs2,000 per kg from Rs1,600 of last year followed by Rs2,400 for pistachio (salted) from Rs1,800 per kg of last year. 
Indian cashew nut costs Rs2,200 per kg as compared to Rs1,600 in 2020, while raisin (kishmish) price has surged to Rs1,000 per kg from Rs600 per kg of last year’s rate. 
The price of walnut kernels (without shell) has risen by Rs300 and reached Rs1,400-1,600 per kg. 
Locally made good quality Gajak is selling at Rs600 per kg as compared to Rs480 per kg last year. 
Mehboob Bhai of Gajak Wallay at M.A. Jinnah Road said that despite three varieties of dried fruit available in the markets, consumers were not freely purchasing them due to soaring cost of living on account of high prices of essential items. 
“Those previously purchasing one kilo of dried fruits of any variety are now hardly buying 250 grams due to rising inflation,” he said while pointing out his old customers, who used to buy in handsome quantities a few years ago. 
Smuggling
The peak buying season in Karachi has yet to arrive, but footfall of buyers has remained 30pc lower than last year, he said, claiming that over 50pc dried fruit demand was met by smuggling. 
He said pine nuts were arriving from Afghanistan and Bannu while consumers were purchasing American almond and Iranian salted pistachio.
Bulk of cashew nut is arriving from India along with some quantities from Thailand, he added.
Former president of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) Haroon Agar said that he had quit importing dried fruit last year due to their smuggling. “The markets are still flooded with 70pc of smuggled dried fruit,” he added. 
He did not agree with the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics figures regarding rise in imports of dried fruit and nuts. “The official figures must be carrying import of low priced dried fruit whose volume is reflected in July-October 2021 data and also in FY21 data,” he added. 
Mr Agar claimed that some unscrupulous traders were both doing smuggling and legal imports simultaneously so that they could show legal import in case of being apprehended in any smuggling case. 
Another dried fruit dealer at Jodia Bazar said the markets still had 50pc smuggled dried fruit. 
He said legal imports had swelled as traders had rushed to lift dried fruit in bulk in the post Covid-19 situation after price drop in world markets in the last one and a half years. 
A dealer in the Saddar area said the rates had gone up by Rs200-400 per kg than last year in different varieties of dried fruits but consumers were limiting their purchase as per their requirement. 
He was of the view that the consumption of dried fruits had definitely improved with new varieties of halwas (sweets) available in existing and newly opened sweetshops over the last few years.

17,All about Taana Baana,"KARACHI: While teaching the importance of art in our lives, teachers, especially those who idolise John Keating from...","KARACHI: While teaching the importance of art in our lives, teachers, especially those who idolise John Keating from Dead Poets Society, often come up with no fewer than half-a-dozen reasons, two of which are: (1) art makes us less lonely and (2) we need beauty around us. While feeling less lonely can help us survive everyday hardships, having beauty around us makes life worthily liveable. Eminent artist Shakil Saigol also puts emphasis on beauty, as is evident from his latest exhibition titled Taana Baana Revisited, which is under way at the Canvas Art Gallery.


‘Under the tree of life’



‘Yoginis’

 
To expand on the idea, this is what the gallery has to say about the artist’s creative pursuit: “Shakil Saigol believes that painting visually beautiful images need no explanations; artworks can be acknowledged for the sake of beauty alone, yet his surrealistic pieces speak volumes where reality and fantasy unify, unleashing otherworldly visions. His paintings are an amalgamation of three subjects that he has been preoccupied with incessantly: sculptures of the Indian subcontinent, colonial furniture, and sarees, a recurrent leitmotif in his paintings. He is completely captivated by its different weaves, textures and colours. Interestingly, Saigol belongs to a family that made its fortune in the textile industry, a field he chose to forego to pursue his artistic inclinations.”


‘Born free’

 
Absolutely right! Beauty needs no elucidation — physical, spiritual and or the one created with the warp and woof (taana baana) of existence. It pleases the senses like no other thing or feeling. And yet, at the heart of it all is Saigol’s incomparable craft. Viewing his large frames is like watching poetry personifying in heart-warming shapes and perfect meter. ‘Born Free’ (watercolour, gouache and gold leaf on arches handmade paper) is a powerful example. His artworks are suffused with aesthetic refinement. The artist achieves that with firm, elegant lines, delectable colours and a vivid imagination.   
The exhibition concludes on Dec 9.
