0,"Low vaccination creating new Covid variants, warns WHO",EU chief mulls mandatory Covid jabs.,"GENEVA: The World Health Orga­nisation on Wednesday warned a  “toxic mix” of low vaccination coverage and low testing rates was creating fertile breeding ground for new Covid-19 variants.
The WHO said measures to stop the globally-dominant Delta variant would also hinder Omicron, first discovered in November in southern Africa and which has since rattled countries around the world.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Gheb­reyesus called on countries to optimise their public health and social measures to control the spread of Covid-19.
He also said nations needed to ensure that high-risk and vulnerable individuals are fully vaccinated  “immediately”.
Tedros sounded a reminder that while global attention turns to Omicron, the world was already grappling with the  “highly transmissible, dangerous” Delta variant, which currently  “accounts for almost all cases” globally.
“We need to use the tools we already have to prevent transmission and save lives from Delta. And if we do that, we will also prevent transmission and save lives from Omicron,” Tedros told a press conference.
“But if countries and individuals don’t do what they need to do to stop transmission of Delta, they won’t stop Omicron either. “Globally, we have a toxic mix of low vaccine coverage, and very low testing — a recipe for breeding and amplifying variants. “That’s why we continue to urge countries to... ensure equitable access to vaccines, tests and therapeutics all over the world.
EU chief mulls mandatory Covid jabs
Europe’s  top official said on Wednesday it was time to  “think about mandatory  vaccination” as the fast-spreading Omicron variant darkened forecasts  and deepened fears of another difficult winter. Ignoring a WHO  warning against blanket travel bans, Japan suspended new flight bookings  into the country as the OECD warned that Omicron threatens economic  recovery and lowered the growth forecast for 2021.
Rising  infection rates have already seen European governments reintroduce  mandatory mask-wearing, social-distancing measures, curfews or lockdowns  in a desperate attempt to limit hospitalisations, but leaving  businesses fearing another grim Christmas.
In Brussels, European  Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said it was  “understandable  and appropriate” to discuss how to  “encourage and potentially think  about mandatory vaccination” in the bloc — although only individual  member states can impose vaccine mandates.
Austria has already  said it will make Covid-19 jabs compulsory next February, Germany is  mulling following suit and Greece on Tuesday said it will mandate  vaccines for over-60s. 
While it could take weeks to prove how  infectious and resistant to current vaccines Omicron is, many countries  have rushed to ramp up existing programmes, seeing them as the best line  of defence.
From Wednesday, every adult in Italy became eligible  for a Covid booster shot, previously only open to those aged over 40. Non-EU members Britain and Norway had already promised booster shots to  all adults before the end of January and Easter respectively.
So  far, more than a dozen countries and territories have detected Omicron  cases, including Australia, Brazil, Britain, Canada, Israel, Italy,  Nigeria and Portugal. Dozens of countries have imposed travel  restrictions mostly targeting southern African nations.
Global  economic body the OECD warned Omicron threatens the world’s recovery and  lowered growth estimates for 2021 from 5.7 percent to 5.6 percent.
The  Paris-based organisation said the recovery had  “lost momentum and is  becoming increasingly imbalanced” and would remain  “precarious” until  vaccines were deployed worldwide.
Japanese authorities, which had already tightened its  tough border measures, on Wednesday said they had detected a second  infection of the new strain — this time in a person arriving from Peru. Other  governments in Asia also expanded curbs, with Indonesia adding Hong  Kong and Malaysia listing Malawi on their travel ban lists.
“A lot  of my neighbors and friends died of Covid-19,” said Jakarta resident  Jan Pieter Tobing.  “Coronavirus is the real deal. So the emergence of  Omicron is very terrifying. Honestly, it’s scary.” France bucked the  trend by announcing flights from southern Africa could land on its  territory from Saturday, but only allowing French and EU residents,  diplomats and flight crews to disembark.
Even as governments acted  unilaterally in imposing travel restrictions, WHO member states came  together in Geneva to work on an international accord on handling the  next pandemic.
An intergovernmental negotiating body will be  established to reach an agreement on responding to future pandemics with  a first meeting due before March 1, 2022.

1,Four injured after WWII bomb explodes in Munich,BERLIN: Four people were injured when an old aircraft bomb exploded at a bridge near Munich’s busy main train...,"

POLICE and firefighters secure the scene after the aircraft bomb exploded during construction work at the train station.—Reuters

 
BERLIN: Four people were injured when an old aircraft bomb exploded at a bridge near Munich’s busy main train station on Wednesday, police said on Twitter, raising the number of wounded from three earlier.
The Munich fire brigade said one of the people was seriously injured.
More than 2,000 tonnes of live bombs and munitions are discovered each year in Germany, more than 70 years after the end of World War Two.
British and American warplanes pummelled the country with 1.5 million tonnes of bombs that killed 600,000 people. Officials estimate that 15pc of the bombs failed to explode, some of which were buried six meters (20 feet) deep in the ground.
The explosion happened as the site was being drilled to build a tunnel, police said, adding the area had been cordoned off. “There is no danger outside this area,” police said.
Explosives experts were summoned to the site to examine the remains of the bomb, the fire brigade said. Due to the blast, rail travel to and from the main train station was suspended, according to rail operator Deutsche Bahn. It was not clear when rail traffic would resume.
World War Two bombs are regularly discovered during construction work in Germany and are usually defused by experts or destroyed in controlled explosions. However, there have been cases of deadly blasts in the past.
Three police explosives experts in Goettingen were killed in 2010 while preparing to defuse a 1,000-pound bomb, and in 2014 a construction worker in Euskirchen was killed when his power shovel struck a buried 4,000-pound bomb. In 1994, three Berlin construction workers were killed in a similar accident.
In 2012, a fireball lit up the sky in Munich, causing millions of euros of damage to 17 buildings, when authorities had to detonate a deteriorated 500-pound bomb. In 2015, a 1,000-pound bomb ripped a three-meter-deep hole in a motorway near Offenbach in central Germany.

2,EU plans Global Gateway project to counter China’s Belt and Road strategy,EU chief calls it a  “roadmap for major investment in infrastructure development around the world.”,"BRUSSELS: The European Commission announced on Wednesday a plan to mobilise 300 billion euros ($340 billion) in public and private infrastructure investment around the world, a move seen as a response to China’s Belt and Road strategy.
“Global Gateway will aim at mobilising investments of up to 300 billion euros between 2021 and 2027... bringing together resources of the EU, member states, European financial institutions and national development finance institutions,” a commission document said.
The Global Gateway plan does not mention China’s rival and longer-standing international infrastructure strategy by name — but EU chief Ursula von der Leyen called it a  “roadmap for major investment in infrastructure development around the world.” 
The money to be made available will not come from EU and member state coffers, and the plan will need funding from international institutions and from the private sector if it is to get anywhere near its target.
China launched its global investment strategy known as Belt and Road, a flagship project of President Xi Jinping, in 2013. Beijing has said it had invested $139.8 billion by 2020, including $22.5 billion last year alone.
Officially, it aims to develop land and sea infrastructure to better connect China to Asia, Europe and Africa for trade and development, and it has found many partners around the world.
The West, however, sees it as a tool for China to influence poorer countries. They criticise Beijing for inciting emerging economies to take on too much debt, and allege the secretive tender process is prone to corruption.
China argues that it respects its partners’ sovereignty while providing loans that benefit joint projects, while critics say Beijing’s contractual terms ignore abuses of human, labour and environmental rights.
The EU strategy is an offshoot of a plan by G7 countries to offer developing countries an alternative to Belt and Road presented in June at the industrial powers’ summit in Cornwall.
Jutta Urpilainen, the EU commissioner for international partnerships, defended the bloc’s performance, telling reporters that European development aid between 2013 and 2018 was  “very close” to the level of Belt and Road funding. In addition to mobilising funds. the EU plan aims to share European technology and expertise with developing economies.
“We want to make Global Gateway a trusted brand that stands out because of high quality, reliable standards and high level of transparency and good governance,” said Von der Leyen.
“We are deeply convinced that this will ensure that investment makes a real difference on the ground. And this that this is done in a sustainable way.”

3,US accuses China of ‘economic warfare’ against Australia,"“China’s preference would have been to break Australia. To drive Australia to its knees,” says veteran diplomat.","SYDNEY: US President Joe Biden’s top Pacific envoy on Wednesday accused China of trying to  “drive Australia to its knees” through a barrage of sanctions that amounted to  “economic warfare”.
In remarks to the Sydney-based Lowy Institute, veteran diplomat Kurt Campbell lampooned Beijing for strong-arm tactics.
Painting China as increasingly bellicose and determined to impose its will overseas, Campbell said Beijing had engaged in  “really dramatic economic warfare — directed against Australia”.
Over the last two years, China has introduced a raft of punitive sanctions on Australian goods in a fierce political dispute that has frozen ministerial contacts and plunged relations into the most serious crisis since the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989.
“China’s preference would have been to break Australia. To drive Australia to its knees,” said Campbell, who currently serves as the White House Indo-Pacific coordinator.
China has been angered at Australia’s willingness to legislate against overseas influence operations, to bar Huawei from 5G contracts and to call for an independent investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic.
Australian barley, coal, copper ores, cotton, hay, logs, rock lobsters, sugar, wine, beef, citrus fruit, grains, table grapes, dairy products and infant formula have all been subject to Chinese sanctions.
The US envoy said that under President Xi Jinping, China has become  “more risk acceptant, more assertive, more determined to basically take steps that other countries would view as coercive”.
The Biden administration has embraced a policy of  “strategic competition” with China — acknowledging rivalry between the two powers but maintaining ties so conflicts do not spiral out of hand.
Beijing repudiated the comments on Wednesday, claiming Australian politicians had  “played up the China threat theory, accused and attacked China for no reason, provoked tension and created confrontation”.
“We hope the relevant people on the US side will not confuse right and wrong,” foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a regular press conference.
Biden recently shocked many in the region by agreeing to share sensitive nuclear-powered submarine technology with Canberra, allowing Australia to dramatically increase its military deterrence. Campbell indicated the move — part of a broader three-way AUKUS agreement that includes Britain — would bind the three allies for generations.
“When we look back on the Biden administration — I believe it will be among the most significant things that we accomplish. And I think in 20 years it will be taken as a given that our sailors sail together, our submarines port in Australia.” Canberra and London’s economic ties with a rapidly growing China had put the alliance in doubt, Campbell admitted. “Seven or eight years ago, if you asked the countries that were most likely to realign strategically and kind of rethink its options... near the top of that list would probably be both Great Britain and Australia,” he said.
Campbell also revealed that other Pacific allies would likely take part in cyber or other non-submarine aspects of the AUKUS agreement.
“Many close allies have come to us, in the immediate aftermath and said, can we participate? Can we engage?  “It is to the credit of Australia and Great Britain, that they insisted, yes, this is not a closed architecture.”

4,Train kills two elephants walking on track in India,"GAUHATI: A passenger train hit and killed two wild elephants in northeastern India’s Assam state, authorities said...","GAUHATI: A passenger train hit and killed two wild elephants in northeastern India’s Assam state, authorities said on Wednesday.
The two adult elephants were walking on the railway track when the train, on its way to the eastern tea-growing town of Dibrugarh from New Delhi, ran over them, killing them almost immediately, Assam wildlife ranger Dilip Kumar Das said.
The accident occurred late on Tuesday, he said. Authorities went to the site, surrounded by thick forests, on Wednesday and buried the bodies after carrying out an autopsy, Das said.
Wild elephants often stray into human habitations this time of year, when rice fields are ready for harvesting, he added.
Speeding trains have hit dozens of wild elephants in Assam in the past, forcing Indian Railways, which runs the trains, to regulate speed in known elephant zones.
Assam has an estimated 5,000 wild Asiatic elephants.

5,"Four killed, seven injured in US school shooting","OXFORD TOWNSHIP: Four students were killed when a sophomore opened fire at a Michigan high school on Tuesday,...","OXFORD TOWNSHIP: Four students were killed when a sophomore opened fire at a Michigan high school on Tuesday, authorities said.
The four students who were killed were 16-year-old Tate Myre, 14-year-old Hana St. Juliana, 17-year-old Madisyn Baldwin and Justin Shilling. The last named died of injuries on Wednesday.
The 16-year-old boy died in a deputy’s patrol car on the way to a hospital. Seven people were wounded, some critically, including a 14-year-old girl who was placed on a ventilator after surgery.
Investigators were still trying to determine a motive for the shooting on Tuesday at Oxford High School, located in a community of about 22,000 people roughly 48 kilometres north of Detroit, Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard said. The person that’s got the most insight and the motive is not talking, he said at a news conference late on Tuesday.
Deputies rushed to the school around lunch time as more than 100 calls flooded 911 dispatchers with reports of a shooter. They arrested the student in a hallway within minutes of their arrival. He put his hands in the air as deputies approached, Bouchard said.
The boy’s father on Friday bought the 9 mm Sig Sauer used in the shooting, Bouchard said. He didn’t know why the man bought the semiautomatic handgun, which his son had been posting pictures of and practicing shooting, Bouchard said. Authorities did not immediately release the boy’s name.
Bouchard said Myre died in a patrol car as a deputy tried to get him to an emergency room.
A teacher who received a graze wound to the shoulder left the hospital, but seven students ranging in age from 14 to 17 remained hospitalised through the night with gunshot wounds, he said.

6,"In Doha talks, US seeks  to prevent future attacks, Taliban seek assets",Official US statement says discussions focused on “enduring US national interests”.,"WASHINGTON: In this week’s Doha talks, the United States urged Taliban to ensure their territory is not used for future terrorist attacks while the Taliban demanded unfreezing of Afghan state assets and lifting of US sanctions.
On Nov 29 and 30, US Special Representative for Afghanistan Thomas West held a series of meetings with Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in the Qatari capital, Doha.
The US delegation included representatives from the Department of State, Treasury, USAID, and the intelligence community while the Taliban delegation included senior officials of their interim government and “technocratic professionals,” the US State Department said.
The official US statement, issued in Washington, said the discussions focused on “enduring US national interests” and “this engagement” was “a continuation of pragmatic diplomacy on Afghanistan in coordination with US allies and partners.”
“The US delegation emphasised the importance of the Taliban fulfilling its public commitment not to allow anyone to pose a threat to any country from the soil of Afghanistan,” US State Department Spokesperson Ned Price told reporters.
The US team also underlined the need to provide safe passage for US citizens and Afghans to whom the US has “a special commitment,” the statement said. US negotiators also demanded the protection of the rights of all Afghan citizens, including its women, girls, and minorities, and the safe release of an American hostage, Mark Frerichs.
The US statement, however, did not mention a key demand, the creation of an all-inclusive government in Kabul, which should include non-Taliban political forces as well.
In a tweet posted on his official site, Taliban Foreign Ministry spokesperson Abdul Qahar Balkhi said the two sides discussed and exchanged views on political, economic, health, education, security and humanitarian issues.
“The Afghan side assured them about security, urged immediate unconditional unfreezing of Afghan reserves, ending of sanctions & blacklists, & disconnecting humanitarian issues from political considerations,” Mr Balkhi tweeted. “Overall, the sessions were positive and both sides agreed to continue such meetings moving forward.”
The US statement said the two teams also discussed the international community’s on-going and urgent response to the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, and the US delegation pledged to continue to support UN and humanitarian actors’ efforts to scale up to meet lifesaving needs this coming winter.
“The United States remains committed to ensuring that US sanctions do not limit the ability of Afghan civilians to receive humanitarian support from the US government and international community while denying assets to sanctioned entities and individuals,” the statement added.
The US Department of the Treasury has issued general licenses to support the continued flow of humanitarian assistance to the people of Afghanistan and other activities that support basic human needs.
The Doha talks followed growing appeals to scale up financial aid to Afghanistan, where the United Nations says more than half the population is suffering from acute hunger this winter.
“Special Representative West welcomed the Taliban’s follow-through on safe passage commitments and recognised improvements in providing all humanitarian workers safe and unimpeded access to communities in need,” the US statement said.
“The Taliban reiterated their pledge not to allow the territory of Afghanistan to be used by anyone to threaten any country,” Mr Price added. “US officials expressed concern regarding the continuing presence of Al Qaeda and IS in Afghanistan.”
The US delegation noted recent statements from Taliban leaders “expressing support for women and girls’ access to education at all levels and urged implementation of that commitment countrywide,” he added.
According to the official US statement, the Taliban “expressed openness to engaging with the international community on full access to education and welcomed efforts to verify and monitor progress to enroll women and girls in school at all levels. The Taliban asked for support in the education sector.”
American officials expressed deep concern over allegations of human rights abuses and urged the Taliban to protect the rights of all Afghans, uphold and enforce its policy of general amnesty, and take additional steps to form an inclusive and representative government, Mr Price said.

7,CNN suspends anchor Chris Cuomo over help he gave his governor brother,"Spokesperson says recently released transcripts show Chris's ""greater level of involvement"" in brother's defence.","NEW YORK: CNN said on Tuesday it had indefinitely suspended primetime anchor Chris Cuomo after the release of legal transcripts that revealed how he helped his brother Andrew, then the governor of New York, combat allegations of sexual misconduct.
At the start of the pandemic, the brothers soared to new heights of popularity: Andrew Cuomo earned praise for his frank daily briefings as the coronavirus ravaged New York, and their live exchanges on CNN were peppered with banter.
But after months of battling claims that he had harassed about a dozen women including former staffers, Andrew Cuomo resigned from office in August.
In October, the 63-year-old former governor was charged with a misdemeanor sex crime for forcible touching.
And now, his 51-year-old brother is under scrutiny for his involvement in his brother’s defense.
“The New York Attorney General’s office released transcripts and exhibits on Monday that shed new light on Chris Cuomo’s involvement in his brother’s defense,” a CNN spokesperson said.
“The documents, which we were not privy to before their public release, raise serious questions.” The spokesperson said while CNN had  “understood his need to put family first and job second” in aiding Andrew, it said the transcripts released by state Attorney General Letitia James  “point to a greater level of involvement in his brother’s efforts than we previously knew.”  
“As a result, we have suspended Chris indefinitely, pending further evaluation.” The brothers are the sons of former New York governor Mario Cuomo.
On Tuesday, Cuomo’s show was replaced with a second hour anchored by Anderson Cooper. The network’s long-term plan for filling the time slot was not immediately clear.

8,"Pakistan, UN suggest more resources for developing world","UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan, elected chair of the Group of 77 on Tuesday, joined the UN chief in demanding more...","UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan, elected chair of the Group of 77 on Tuesday, joined the UN chief in demanding more resources for developing countries to help them recover from the debilitating effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
Addressing the group’s 45th annual meeting at the UN headquarters in New York, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi urged the developing nations to promote a common development agenda to return to the path of sustained and sustainable growth. 
In his address to the virtual meeting, UN Secretary General António Guterres urged the international community to go beyond universal access to Covid-19 vaccines and help nations in rebuilding their economies. 
“We must provide developing countries with the liquidity they need so that they can invest in a sustainable recovery, restart their economies and restore their vibrant societies,” he said. 
Mr Guterres also said that vaccine inequality and lack of solidarity were entrenching many other inequalities and injustices among countries and regions, between the rich and the poor, and between the global North and the global South. “The current extremely uneven recovery pace can have dire consequences, especially for developing countries,” he warned. 
The bloc, known as G77 plus China, is a loose alliance of developing countries established on June 15, 1964. The group derives its name from the 77 original signatories, although it now has 134 members. Pakistan is a founding member and has had the distinct privilege to chair the group in New York on three occasions. 
As the new chair, Foreign Minister Qureshi said, “Pakistan hopes to collaborate with members of the group to promote a common development agenda for developing countries that includes debt restructuring, redistribution of the 650 billion new special drawing rights (SDR) to developing countries, and larger concessional financing.” 
SDRs are supplementary foreign exchange reserve assets defined and maintained by the International Monetary Fund. 
Mr Qureshi also called for the mobilisation of $100 billion in annual climate finance by the developed countries, ending the billions in illicit financial flows from developing countries and the return of their stolen assets. He also underlined the need for creating an equitable and open trading system along with a fair international tax regime. 
The primary goals of the G77 are to maintain the independence and sovereignty of all developing countries and defend the economic interests of member states by insisting on equal standing with the developed countries in the global marketplace. 
Mr Qureshi reminded the international community that the world was facing a triple challenge: Covid-19 pandemic and its consequences, realisation of sustainable development goals (SDGs) and climate change. 
Mr Qureshi noted that the rich nations had injected over $26 trillion to stimulate their economies and recover from the Covid-19 crisis, but “the developing countries have been unable to mobilise even a fraction of the $3-4 trillion they need for economic recovery”. 
Noting that the developing world was home to 80 per cent of the world’s population, he warned that the disruption of supply chains, and the revived demand in developed economies, had triggered global inflation, compounded the plight of the poor and complicated the debt and liquidity problems of the developing countries.

9,Sword carried by Napoleon in 1799 coup up for auction,NEW YORK: The dress sword carried by Napoleon Bonaparte when he staged a coup in 1799 will go under the hammer at ...,"NEW YORK: The dress sword carried by Napoleon Bonaparte when he staged a coup in 1799 will go under the hammer at the weekend with five other weapons that belonged to the French emperor, US auctioneers announced.
The lot, which will be put up for auction from December 3 to 5 by the Illinois-based Rock Island Auction Company, is valued at $1.5 million to $3.5 million.
The sword, with its scabbard, is the  “crown jewel” of the collection, said the auctioneers, who will host the sale both in person and online.
The weapon was made by Nicolas-Noel Boutet, who was director of the state arms factory in Versailles.
After being crowned emperor, Napoleon is believed to have presented the sword to general Jean-Andoche Junot, but the general’s wife later was forced to sell it to pay off debts.
It was then recovered by a London museum. A US collector was its last owner, but the man recently died, according to the auction house.
In May, France celebrated the bicentennial of Napoleon’s death.
The famed Corsican is one of the most divisive figures in French history, his huge contribution to the creation of the modern state set against his imperialism and war-mongering.

10,Mayor arrested for opposing depiction of Sheikh Mujib in mural in Bangladesh's Rajshahi,"“This is not correct according to Islamic Sharia,” the mayor had said.","DHAKA: Mayor of a city in Bangladesh who refused to permit a mural depicting Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s father on religious grounds was arrested on Wednesday, police said. 
Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was Bangladesh’s first leader and since his daughter took power in 2009, authorities have erected more than 1,000 murals and monuments to venerate him. Scores of people have been charged for defaming him under the country’s notorious internet laws, which rights groups say have been used by Hasina to silence dissent. 
Abbas Ali, the mayor of western Rajshahi city, found himself in the spotlight last month after an audio clip of his comments against a proposed Mujib mural went viral.  “This is not correct according to Islamic Sharia,” he had said. “That’s why I won’t keep it. I will build everything as it’s planned, except for this last part.” 
Islamic traditions forbid depictions of people in murals or statues. His comments triggered protests in his hometown. The mayor initially claimed the clip was fake, but later apologised on Facebook and fled town. 
Police arrested Ali from a hotel in the capital Dhaka on Wednesday, spokesman Khandaker Al Moin said. 
“He admitted he made the comment. He was absconding in different hotels in Dhaka since November 23. We had information that he’s planning to flee the country,” he added. 
The case follows last month’s sacking by Hasina of Zahagir Alam, the mayor of the industrial city of Gazipur, after he allegedly defamed Mujib. 
Both Alam and Ali are members of Hasina’s ruling Awami League party. Mujib led his country to independence in 1971 after a horrific nine-month war. He was assassinated four years later along with most of his family members. 
Under his daughter Hasina, 74, activists say the human rights situation in Bangladesh has deteriorated sharply, with clampdowns on free expression that have seen hundreds of journalists and activists arrested. 
Hasina’s main political opposition has been crippled with its chief and her arch-rival Khaleda Zia jailed for corruption.

11,US tells Russia to pull back from Ukraine or face painful sanctions,"Ukraine has said there is a build-up of more than 90,000 Russian troops near its border.","RIGA: The United States urged Russia on Wednesday to pull back its troops from the Ukrainian border, warning that a Russian invasion would provoke sanctions that would hit Moscow harder than any imposed until now.
“We don’t know whether President (Vladimir) Putin has made the decision to invade. We do know that he is putting in place the capacity to do so on short order should he so decide,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.
“Should Russia follow the path of confrontation, when it comes to Ukraine, we’ve made clear that we will respond resolutely, including with a range of high impact economic measures that we have refrained from pursuing in the past.”  Blinken was speaking in the Latvian capital Riga after conferring with foreign ministers from Nato and Ukraine on how to respond to what Kiev says is a Russian build-up of more than 90,000 troops near its border.
Russia seized the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 but denies aggressive intent in the current crisis and says it is responding to threatening behaviour by Nato and Ukraine.
The Kremlin said it feared Ukraine was gearing up to try to recapture by force areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists in the Donbass region in the east of the country - something Kiev denies — and accused it of  “very dangerous adventurism”.
It said Russia could not take any steps to de-escalate because of a large concentration of Ukrainian forces close to the border.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Europe faced a critical moment and Russia was trying to shift the blame onto Ukraine.
“I would like again to officially state that Ukraine does not plan any military offensive in Donbass. This is Russian propaganda nonsense in order to cover up Russia’s own preparations for a potential attack.”  Blinken declined to spell out what sanctions Russia might face and encouraged both Moscow and Kiev to return to diplomacy and revive a 2014 peace plan for eastern Ukraine.
Russia has blunted the impact of sanctions imposed over its invasion of Crimea by reducing its borrowings on foreign financial markets and maintaining large currency and gold reserves.
But the West has more potential leverage now if it were to target the newly built Nord Stream 2 pipeline under the Baltic Sea, through which Russia is keen to start pumping gas as soon as it gets the green light from a German regulator.Ukraine has centuries of shared history with Russia and Moscow keenly resents its westward tilt since a pro-Russian president was ousted in a revolution in 2014.
It current aspiration to join both the European Union and Nato has made it the main flashpoint in Russia’s deteriorating relations with the West.
Putin said on Wednesday that Moscow wanted serious negotiations with the United States and its allies to extract legal guarantees that would rule out any further Nato moves to the east and the deployment of weapons systems close to Russian territory.
A day earlier, the Kremlin leader said Russia was ready with a newly tested hypersonic weapon in case Nato crossed its  “red lines” and deployed missiles in Ukraine.
Blinken told a news conference:  “The idea that Ukraine represents a threat to Russia would be a bad joke if things weren’t so serious. Nato itself is a defensive alliance, we’re not a threat to Russia.”  Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg rejected accusations the alliance was provoking Moscow with military exercises in the Black Sea.
“The problem with Russia is that they are not transparent, that they have a very aggressive rhetoric and a track record showing they have used military exercises before as a disguise for aggressive actions against neighbours,” he told the Reuters Next online summit.
Russia said it had started regular winter military drills in its southern military district, parts of which border Ukraine, and that 10,000 troops had relocated to training grounds across the huge area. Its ally Belarus has also announced joint military drills with Russia on the Ukrainian border.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said direct talks with Moscow were needed to end the war in the east, which Kiev says has killed more than 14,000 people.
“We must tell the truth that we will not be able to stop the war without direct negotiations with Russia, and today this has already been recognised by all, all external partners,” Zelenskiy told parliament.
