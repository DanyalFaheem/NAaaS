A total of 22 teams comprising 88 members started their journey from Gulabpur area of Shigar and arrived in Sandus area of Skardu on Tuesday, travelling 70 kilometres distance through Shigar and Indus rivers.
The Zakh tradition was set by the residents of Shigar as they used the traditional rafts to travel through the Shigar and Indus rivers.
In ancient times, Zakh also remained a source of crossing rivers in the region when there were no roads and bridges.
Each team comprising four people, including the boatman, holding national flags and singing national and traditional songs travelled through the rivers amid freezing temperatures.
They had arrived near the central Shigar on Monday evening, where they stayed for the night.
On Tuesday morning, the teams started their journey and arrived in Sandus area of Skardu in the evening. The locals warmly received the participants of the rally, showering them with flower petals.
However, the participants of the rally were disappointed as the local administration did not arrange reception for them.
Javaid Shigri, one of the organisers of the event, said no administration official came to receive the participants despite the fact that the rally was meant to promote winter tourism in the region. He demanded of the government to encourage such events.
Zulfiqar Ali Shigri, another organiser, said the youth of Gulabpur village of Shigar had organised the event. “The Zakh rally was held to promote winter tourism and explore the old ways of travelling long distances through water by the indigenous people,” he added.
Zakh is a traditional raft made of skin of animals and wooden sticks.

1,"One year on, govt yet to enforce medics’ protection law",Most of our staffers fear for their lives during duty hours due to the brutalities committed by relatives of patients: official,"PESHAWAR: The government is yet to implement a law meant to protect health workers against violence in hospitals and ensure patients’ rights despite its passage by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly one year ago.
The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Healthcare Service Providers and Facilities (Prevention of Violence and Damage to Property) Act, 2020 was passed by the provincial assembly in December last year but it has not been implemented so far.
The law has been enacted in view of the endless series of violence against healthcare workers by relatives of patients in hospitals. Doctors, nurses and paramedics have been observing strikes in healthcare institutions due to the attacks.
The incidents prompted the health department to come with a law to give protection to the health workers so that patients could get unhampered treatment. Under the law, the violators would face heavy fine and jail terms.
The special secretary health, Dr Syed Farooq Jamil, who led the team that drafted the law, told Dawn that it would be enforced soon after fulfilment of necessary formalities.
“The assembly has passed it and rules have been framed now which have been sent to law department for vetting,” he said. Once the rules are vetted, those will be sent to provincial cabinet for approval.
The law would be implemented to ensure protection of health staff against the attacks and pave way for smooth healthcare services in hospitals, he added.

Associations of doctors and paramedics have been urging the government to implement the law to check perpetrators of violence in hospitals.
“Most of our staffers fear for their lives during duty hours due to the brutalities committed by relatives of the patients under the misconception that their patients are mistreated,” an office-bearer of the Provincial Doctors Association said.
He said that health department and Khyber Medical University played key role in drafting the law. He added that it was now up to the government to enforce the law.
He said that the law had been approved by the assembly after years of struggle and incorporation of several amendments to tighten safety of the health workers but delaying its implementation was creating unrest among the stakeholders.
He said that protection of healthcare providers at the workplace was desperately required for the sake of more effective and focused care of patients. About a dozen incidents occurred only in the current year in which the health professionals were beaten up but due to coronavirus pandemic, the medics avoided going on strikes and harming patients, he said.
Under section-3 of the law, any act of violence against healthcare providers or damage to property in a healthcare service institution is punishable. Anyone, who commits any act in contravention of it, will be punished with imprisonment of three years along with fine of up to Rs50,000.
Its sub-section-1 says that the offender shall be liable to pay to the healthcare service institution a compensation of twice the amount of purchase price of medical equipment damaged and the loss caused to the property as may be determined by the court trying the offence.
According to the law, if the offender does not pay the compensation under sub-section-2, the said sum shall be recovered as if it is an arrear of land revenue due from him. Any offence committed under section 3 shall be cognisable and non-bailable, it says.
The sub-section says that the provisions of the law would be in addition to and not in derogation of the provisions of any other law for the time being in vogue.
Not only protection of healthcare providers, but the law also makes it binding on healthcare institutions to give complete information of medical treatment to patients.
According to the piece of legislation, it shall be the responsibility of each healthcare service institution to furnish, in writing, complete information about medical treatment provided by such healthcare service institutions, to the patients, who seek treatment in the said institutions or to their designated relatives.

“I am here to deliver you Salam of [PML-N supremo and former prime minister] Nawaz Sharif. If you extend your support to us as you did in the past, we can force this [PTI] government out of power,” he told a public meeting in Dasu, the district headquarters of Upper Kohistan district, on Wednesday.

The PML-N leader said the government should be ousted without delay to ensure the holding of free and fair general elections in the country.
“We will force this government into quitting as if it remains in power any further, the country will go bankrupt,” he said.
Mr Abbasi said the people hadn’t witnessed any positive change in their life since the PTI formed the government in the centre three and a half years ago.

Addressing a press conference here on Wednesday, he criticised the wildlife department and the ministry of climate change for ignoring the stakeholders of the national park since its establishment in 2010. 
Mr Mulk said that recently the park management had included 12 villages of the valley in the core zone of the park, which would deprive them of the right of grazing their yaks in their pastures. He said that livestock keeping was their only source of sustenance as agriculture was not possible due to harsh climatic conditions of the area. 

VCC president says move will deprive people of grazing rights

He warned that the residents of Baroghil would never cede their right of grazing yaks in the grass fields, as it would leave them with no source of income. 
The VCC board members, including Akram Ali Shah, Taj Ali Baig and Qadam Ali, were also present on the occasion. 
Mr Mulk alleged that eleven years had passed after establishment of the park, but no practical steps had so far been taken for its development. He claimed that the department had always taken major decisions without taking their rights and interests into consideration.
The VCC president said no national park could be maintained without taking into confidence the local community and ensuring their participation in decision making and implementation processes. He regretted that in Baroghil the architects of management plan had excluded them. 
He said Baroghil was the home of glaciers, 36 bio-active lakes and highland pastures, which supported many species of wild animals and birds.

The local leaders said the award of party ticket to Bakhtzada, brother of PPP provincial vice-president Akhunzada Chattan, for Khar subdivision tehsil chairman slot was unjustified. 
They said nomination of Bakhtzada, who got retired from the now defunct Bajaur Levies as constable in 2018, for the tehsil nazim’s slot had disappointed the party workers.
They claimed several senior party workers, who had submitted nomination papers for the Nawagai tehsil chairman’s slot, were refused the party ticket. They urged PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari to take notice of the issue.
