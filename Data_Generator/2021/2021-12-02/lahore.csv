0,NTDC rewards itself for project executed by Chinese,Reward list includes officers who have nothing to do with the project as they have been performing duties in Islamabad.,"LAHORE: The National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) has approved a reward honorarium, equal to two running basic pays, for its own 58 employees, for completing a mega project, which was mainly executed by the Chinese engineers under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), whereas the company (NTDC) was to monitor the project activities. 
An official said it was the waste of Rs7.5 million to be distributed among 58 NTDC employees, including the MD, DMD and GMs, even though the project (Matiari-Lahore High Voltage Direct Current-HVDC transmission line) was completed by Chinese, whereas the NTDC monitored the project and provided right of way, line testing, etc. 
According to another official source, though the MD had financial powers, but it did not mean to reward a huge number of people. Moreover, the MD is working on an acting charge basis under which he can monitor and perform day-to-day affairs of the company and not make decisions that involve huge money to waste. 
“It (the disbursement of the reward) was okay to the extent of lower-grade officials—drivers, clerks, etc and not the MD, DMD, chief engineers and managers,” the source said. 
The reward list includes those officers who have nothing to do with the project as they have been performing duties in the Islamabad-based National Power Control Centre. 
“It is also wondering that the name of the MD, who was not even part of the HVDC team constituted by the ministry to get the line’s Commercial Operation Date (September 1, 2021) achieved in collaboration with the Chinese firm, was also included in the award list,” the source said.  
The MD was not available for comment. 
A senior member of the NTDC’s BoD said: “This matter was not brought before the BoD. But the MD is competent authority to do so,” he added.

1,Judge thrashing case: Punjab Bar Council suspends five lawyers’ licences,Legal fraternity boycotts courts in Mandi Bahauddin against registration of cases on judge's complaint.,"GUJRAT: The Punjab Bar Council, taking suo motu notice of an attack on a consumer court in Mandi Bahauddin, has suspended the licences of at least five lawyers, including Mandi Bahauddin district bar association president Zahid Yar Gondal and secretary Yasir Arafat, for their alleged involvement in manhandling and thrashing of judge Rao Abdul Jabbar. 
A heavy police contingent had been deployed around the consumer court for the security of judge following Tuesday’s attack by a group of angry lawyers as Mandi Bahauddin DBA boycotted the courts on Wednesday. 
The decision to suspend the licences of five lawyers and issuance of show-cause notices was taken at a meeting of the PbBC executive committee held on Nov 30. 
According to a press release issued by the PbBc secretary on Wednesday, the offices of president and secretary of Mandi Bahauddin DBA have been ceased and five lawyers Matiur Rehman Ranjha, Zeeshan Gondal, Aurangzeb Gondal, Zahid Yar Gondal and Yasir Arafat issued notices to appear before the executive committee on Dec 6 to explain as to why their licences should not be cancelled permanently for their misbehaviour with the judge.  
The PbBC has taken the notice following a video of lawyers thrashing the judge at the courtroom, went viral on the social media and the issue was discussed in the executive committee meeting. 
On the other hand, the legal fraternity boycotted the courts in Mandi Bahauddin on Wednesday against the registration of a case against the bar officials and other lawyers under Anti-Terrorism Act and other sections of PPC on the complaint of judge Rao Abdul Jabbar on Tuesday. 
The judge had earlier issued a show-cause notice to Mr Gondal to explain his conduct during contempt of court proceedings against the then deputy commissioner Tariq Basra and assistant commissioner Imtiaz Ali Beig on Friday last and Dec 1 was fixed as the date for submission of response to the notice.  
However, it was learnt that no one appeared before the court from the DBA president side due to strike by lawyers and the judge fixed Dec 7 next date for hearing.  
Meanwhile, police during raids on Wednesday arrested three [nominated] lawyers.

3,Seeking justice turns out to be a long haul,"LAHORE:  The Punjab Subordinate Judiciary Service Tribunal, a statutory forum to  decide service matters of judicial...","LAHORE:  The Punjab Subordinate Judiciary Service Tribunal, a statutory forum to  decide service matters of judicial officers, has [unprecedentedly] held  its sittings continuously for five working days of a week in a row from  Nov 15 to 19 ever since its establishment in 1991.  
However,  record shows that some of the service appeals pending on the docket of  the tribunal were filed over 20 years ago and some of the appeals faded  away due to death or superannuation of the appellants/judicial officers.   
The Lahore High Court (LHC) has recently issued a notification  regarding the restoration of a civil judge, Khalid Farooq, nine months  after the tribunal allowed his appeal against the termination in 2011.
The  administration committee of the LHC, comprising the chief justice and  six next most senior judges, is the competent authority for the judicial  officers, which decides their fate in disciplinary matters like  dismissal, removal from service, compulsory retirement, reprimand,  reinstatement, expunction of adverse remarks in ACRs and promotions.  
The  composition of the tribunal is three sitting judges of the LHC and it  is empowered to examine the validity of decisions of the administration  committee, which comprises seven senior justices of the court.
Every  new chief justice of the LHC, upon assumption of his office, nominates  three judges of his choice to form the three-member tribunal. At present  Justice Mirza Viqas Rauf heads the tribunal as its chairman with  Justice Sajid Mahmood Sethi and Justice Sarfraz Dogar its members.  
It  is learnt that the tribunal used to hold its sittings rarely in the  distant past and that too briefly only on Fridays because of which a  huge backlog of service appeals by judicial officers have accumulated.
The  tribunal remains dysfunctional for pretty longer spans of time due to  preoccupation of its chairman or any of its two members in other  judicial assignments, unavailability of any of the members at the  principal seat Lahore and also during summer and winter vacation.  
Justice  Rauf, the present chairman of the tribunal, has been performing  judicial work at the Rawalpindi bench for months. However, he was  recently posted at the principal seat where he conducted sittings of the  tribunal for five consecutive days.  
A lawyer, whose several  cases are pending with the tribunal, told Dawn that the last time the  tribunal worked regularly was seven years ago when former justice  Farrukh Irfan Khan as its chairman and Justice Abdul Sattar Asghar (also  now retired) and Justice Muhammad Ameer Bhatti, the current chief  justice as he then was, being its members, held continuous sittings of  the forum for a couple of months from April to July 2014 on every  Friday.  
The tribunal had particularly ordered the service  appeals to be fixed in a chronological order when the Supreme Court took  stock of the appalling situation while hearing an appeal filed by an  aggrieved judicial officer in a case during 2013.
A cursory examination of the first of its kind week-long cause list of the tribunal from Nov 15 to 19, available with Dawn,  shows that 30 oldest appeals of judicial officers of different ranks  i.e. civil judges/district and sessions judges having been instituted  between years 2000 and 2018 in chronological order are pending  adjudication.
A lawyer said only a handful of the oldest appeals  could be decided by the tribunal because the lawyers representing the  respondent departmental authority succeeded in seeking adjournments on  one pretext or the other.
The inordinate delay in disposal of the appeals by the tribunal causes anxiety and depression among the judicial officers.
A lawyer told Dawn that  his client/judicial officer sacked in 2004 was reinstated in 2014 and  his subsequent appeal filed in 2015 for the grant of service/financial  back benefits had been decided in his favour lately but he was yet to  reap the benefits of his reinstatement.
In yet another case, a  judge’s appeal filed in 2003 against his termination was allowed by the  tribunal in 2014. Subsequently, he also succeeded in winning his appeal  for grant of back benefits in 2018, however, the authorities at the LHC  have not complied with the tribunal’s decision regarding the grant of  benefits.  
His fresh appeal for implementation of earlier  judgment has also been pending with the tribunal since 2018 and it is  unlikely to anticipate as to when that appeal would be decided.
The  appellant judicial officers, whose cases were taken up in chronological  order during the last sitting of the tribunal are hoping against the  hope of getting their voices heard at least by tribunal, that has at  least broken the barriers of holding Friday-alone sittings.  
However,  no fresh cause list of the tribunal has been issued so far, stalling  the momentum generated during the previous continuous working.

4,16 artists paint a bleak picture of smog,10-day exhibition opens at NCA,"LAHORE: “If you have moist eyes, you are either in love or in Lahore,” said one of the visitors to ‘The Smog Show’ that opened in the National College of Arts (NCA) here on Wednesday. 
Lahore has been in the grip of smog and its air quality index shows it among the world’s worst polluted cities of the world.  
Sixteen artists got together to take on smog that has engulfed the city of Lahore and rest of Punjab in recent months. They are showing their artworks in the exhibition, curated by visual artist Irfan Gul Dahri, in collaboration with documentary filmmaker Jawad Sharif. 

10-day exhibition opens at NCA  

Abid Aslam, one of the sculptors who are a part of the show, explains his art piece, saying, “an artist comments on the conditions through visuals just as he/she visualises any matter. It’s the vision that’s disturbed by smog that affects the eyes and the image gets blurry. It’s this blurry vision that’s the subject of my work being exhibited in the show”. 
Suleman Faisal is exhibiting his sculpture on a pedestal, depicting an apocalyptic scene, a future man wearing a gas mask, all engulfed in red, representing blood and death.  
Kiran Saleem has carved out a human heart out of coal, all blackened with the smog that affects breathing and causes breathlessness. She titled her piece as Khak Ho Jaen Gey Hum Tum Ko Khabar Honay Tak.  
Photographer Umair Ghani had installed his short prose poem, Dhund Dhuain Ka Hath Thamay, along with a headphone where visitors could hear him recite his poem.  
Other artists who are the part of the exhibition are Ali Baba, Noman Siddiqui, Syed Faraz Ali, Arsalan Farooqi, Ammara Jabbar, Abida Dahri, Arsalan Nasir, Wajid Ali Deherkiwala, Mamoona Riaz, Mohsin Shafi, Ahsan Memon and Sameen Agha. 
Irfan Dahri says if the issue of smog is not controlled at the earliest, it will be one of the biggest problems faced by the generations coming after us. He says 
this is the right time to raise awareness among the young people who will take charge of things after us. 
Drawings by public schoolchildren with messages written on them are also a part of the exhibition. In the drawings, the children from different classes have written messages like “Stop producing air pollution,” “We should stop polluting our environment. Help it,” “A lot of smog in the sky” and “Trees are our life savers”. 
A documentary by Jawad Sharif on smog and the artists’ response to it is also a part of the show. 
NCA Principal Prof Dr Murtaza Jafri inaugurated the exhibition. It would continue until Dec 10.

A joint statement by the four photographers – Abdul Waris Hameed, Ghazanfar Bhinder, Muhamamd Saeed Rao and Syed Israr Haider – says: “We, the four common men, had an objective while conceiving the idea of ‘Aaj ke Naam’ to connect some of the dots that make us interacting and living social beings in magnum opus of time.”
“In a quest for exploring the social fabric and sensitivity intertwined with persona of everyone amongst us , our social exposures turned out to be reflections and images displayed on the walls of The Gallery,” the artists said.
They say they collectively believe in the idea that cult or dogma based on any denominator does necessarily need reflection, exposure and highlights. The images came up from lucidity to obscurity in the life of ordinary man, mirth to pain of all the folks, dejected and related personas, carefree street kids and bread-winning exhausted labourers in their moment of existing. The streak running all through their work is dignity and victory of hope over despair.
The photographs belong to different areas of the country such as Balochistan, Thar and Punjab. 
The exhibition will remain open till Dec 3.

6,"Highest inflation a sign of economy’s destruction, says Shehbaz","Govt must decrease petrol price in accordance with fall in rates in international market, he demands.","LAHORE: PML-N president and National Assembly opposition leader Shehbaz Sharif has said that inflation rising to the highest level is a sign of doom for the poor and destruction of the country’s economy.  
“Meaningless lip service by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government will not do any good at a time when inflation has reached a 13-year high while the people are being obliterated by the skyrocketing inflation and unemployment.  
The 11.5 percent monthly increase in inflation is a confession of the PTI government’s destruction of the economy and cruelty towards the people of Pakistan,” Shehbaz said in a statement on Wednesday. 
He said the people were committing suicides due to the inflation, unemployment and lack of livelihood, while the aloof rulers living in a utopian world were calmly asking them not to panic amid “disastrous circumstances” created by Imran Niazi regime.  
“Current account deficit continues to rise, exceeding $5.1 billion. Is this the austerity Imran advocates?” he questioned.  
He said the poor could not even afford a pack of ghee, and were dying from starvation and inability to pay for medicines. “Everything including tomatoes, cooking oil, rice, fruits, vegetables, eggs, meat, milk, sugar, medicines, construction materials, has become too expensive to afford. Are these the good days PTI promised the nation?” he lamented. 
He said the decrease in oil prices was just a ‘lolly pop’ for the people as they no longer trusted the government that dropped the “fuel inflation bomb” on them.
He warned the nation that the government was going to increase the Petroleum Development Levy by Rs4 every month in accordance with the IMF conditions.  
The government must also decrease the petrol price in accordance with the fall in rates in the international market instead of this “window-dressing”, he demanded.  
Shehbaz further said a government that deceived the nation in the name of budget and accepted conditions that were hostile to the people and in the interest of IMF was unreliable. 
“The only way to give relief to the people from these mini-budgets and inflation is to get rid of Imran Niazi government, because the nation can no longer tolerate this tyrant gang.”  
He said the Health Insaf Card did not provide medicines and treatment facilities to the people. The PTI government’s happiness over tax collections due to the sharp rise in imports was a typical example of self-deception, he added.

The police had been unable to trace and arrest the criminals despite setting up a picket in the colony.  
The robbers’ latest target was the house of an eye specialist, Syed Muzamil Hussain, who was intercepted at his doorstep by at least five armed robbers in the colony in the precincts of Civil Lines police on Saturday night last around 9pm. 
The robbers took all the family members hostage at gunpoint as the gate of Mr Shah was opened and locked them in a room. They made off with cash, gold ornaments, foreign currency and other valuables, all worth around Rs2.5 million. 
District Police Officer Umar Salamat and other officials reached the scene soon after the incident and gathered the details whereas the police’s crime scene unit collected the forensic evidence and the got the footage of the close circuit TV (CCTV) cameras installed in the area. 
According to locals, the same gang using the same car had robbed the house of one Athar Mahmood Tarehngi in Shadman Colony around two months ago, looting cash and valuables worth around Rs3m. The criminals could not be arrest so far, they added.  
Similarly, the house of an assistant director of local government, Usman Sarwar, had earlier been robbed by unidentified crimianls in Kalara Khasa in Lorry Adda police precincts on Nov 9 the last. The robbers had taken away cash, gold ornaments and other valuables worth around Rs4m. 
Besides house robberies, some passersby were also robbed in the colony and its adjoining areas during the last few weeks, setting alarm bell ringing for the residents as well as the law enforcement agencies in the city. 
Saqib Butt, a lawyer and a colony resident told Dawn that police had so far failed to trace and arrest the criminals involved in the house robberies. He said even the establishment of a police picket in the colony could not stop the criminals from striking in the are and then escaping easily. 
He said the colony residents were mulling a demonstration against the house robberies, besides arranging private security guards. Meanwhile, he said, most of the residents have installed the CCTV cameras outside their houses and some of them have also hired security guards. 
They have also asked the police to allow them installing gates or barricades on the rear exits of the colony. However, no progress could be made in this retard so far. 
A police source said Shadman Colony, mostly resided by businessmen and expatriates’ families, had too many entry and exit points which should be reduced by installation of gates or barriers. However, he said, the residents of some colonies located on the back road of the colony had been resisting the move. 
A spokesman for Gujrat police said the DPO had held a meeting with the officials concerned recently, constituting special teams to trace and arrest the criminals involved in the fresh wave of house robberies and street crime in various city parts, who were making efforts in this regard.

14,"LHC hints at week-long lockdown for schools, private offices",Judge says health emergency must be imposed in the city.,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Wednesday hinted at ordering a week-long lockdown for schools and private offices in the provincial metropolis due to its poor Air Quality Index (AQI).
Hearing several public interest petitions on the environmental issues, Justice Shahid Karim observed that the AQI aggravated to dangerous levels, making Lahore one of the most polluted cities in the world.
Observing that desperate times call for desperate measures, he said health emergency must be imposed in the city.
A director of the Punjab Disaster Management Authority told the court that there had been a decline in the smog during the last week, hoping the trend to continue during the next week.
A judicial water commission also submitted its report to the court, disclosing that notices had been issued to 47 sugar mills in the province for causing air pollution and not installing water treatment plants.
Advocate Azhar Siddique, on behalf of a petitioner, argued the provincial government had not been performing its statutory obligations to control pollution.
Representing another petitioner, Advocate Sheraz Zaka said the commissioner must ensure closure of the factories causing air pollution and smog. He regretted that the government failed to punish those involved in crop stubble burning -- an activity that massively contributed to smog.
Justice Karim lauded the traffic police efforts for controlling traffic congestion and allowing free flow of vehicles in the city.
Lord Mayor retired Col Mubashir Javed apprised the court of the steps taken against pollution in the city. He said several blocked roads had been reopened for traffic.
The judge adjourned the further hearing till the next week and directed the PDMA officials and others to come prepared for the lockdown if the AQI remained poor.
Separately, Justice Karim disposed of multiple petitions, directing the police not to interfere in the lawful business of oil depots, alleged to have been involved in selling adulterated low-quality oil products and hence contributing towards air pollution.
The judge directed the police if the petitioners (oil depots) were allegedly involved in selling low-quality products, the jurisdiction was vested in oil operations director under the Pakistan Petroleum Blending Marketing Retailing Rules 1971.
The judge noted that it was the jurisdiction of the oil operations director, who could initiate proceedings against the petitioners after conducting sample test of oil products.

Ogra chairman Masroor Khan said the authority would take any decision in line with the interests of the general public.  
“We cannot allow provision of gas to domestic consumers on higher rates. But side by side we cannot address the issues related to gas shortfall (depletion of the indigenous gas reserves) since it is not our subject.

The petitioner projects a shortfall in revenue requirement at Rs92.617 billion including Rs163 million on account of LPG air-mix project for the year and sought an increase in its average prescribed price by Rs269.03 per MMBTU with effect from July 1, 2021.  
The petitioner (SNGPL) has also included Rs219.892 million shortfall pertaining to previous years, thus seeking a total increase in average prescribed price by Rs907.75 per MMBTU from July 1, 2021.  
“First of all I would like to request you to decide that where we want to take the industry? I am surprised that crude oil prices are lowering worldwide and they (the SNGPL people) want to increase gas tariff. The RLNG prices too have been reduced internationally,” deplored Haji Muhammad Ayub, a former office-bearer of the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association.  
“You will have to rationalise the gas tariff if you want to keep the industry operational,” he warned.  
Mr Ayub criticised the SNGPL for announcing a subsidised tariff for Bhalwal industrial estate which is yet to be made operational. “But on the other hand, the tariff for the existing industry is being worked out to be enhanced,” he wondered and asked the SNGPL to reduce its UFG losses.  
Mehboob Elahi, an energy expert and a former Ogra member, was of the view that the officers should come out of their air-conditioned offices and focus on reducing the UFG losses.  
A participant told Dawn that people were already in trouble due to high prices of commodities and Ogra must take a pro-people decision. 
SNGPL MD Ali J. Hamdani said the depleting reserves of indigenous gas and increasing demand of domestic consumers was the biggest challenge for the company. “So if there is shortage of gas due to delay in procurement of the LNG cargoes or any other reasons on the part of the authorities concerned, the SNGPL having seven million consumers shouldn’t be held responsible.”

He was talking to the media after some local PML-N leaders announced joining the PPP here on Wednesday.
Mr Ashraf also chided the PML-N for what he said only favouring the development of urban centres and giving funds to posh areas during its rule.
He said the government was beating around the bush instead of sitting with the opposition to discuss the electronic voting machines and setting parameters and codes for the electoral exercise.
He admitted that the Election Commission of Pakistan could not go beyond the (election) law(s) enacted by the parliament, but it would have to satisfy the reservations of the opposition regarding the EVMs before using the voting machines in the election.
General Secretary Hassan Murtaza demanded a transparent inquiry into the video scandal in which some purported PML-N workers are offering cash against votes for the party nominee for NA-133 by-polls.
Denying that the PPP was using similar tactics, he said the party believed in the public support and not a mandate based on vote buying.
