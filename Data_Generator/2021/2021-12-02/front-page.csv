0,Punjab govt will amend law to use EVMs in LG polls,Opposition parties vehemently reject the Punjab government’s plans to bulldoze the all-important legislation.,"• Opposition rejects proposal drafted without consultation
• ECP gives a week to submit amendment
LAHORE: The Punjab government has announced its plans to introduce Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) in the upcoming local government elections on a plea that the federal government has already legislated and declared the use of the machines mandatory in all upcoming elections, while the government also managed to allay reservations of its ally, PML-Q, about the Punjab Local Government (Amendment) Act (PLGA) 2021.
“Since the federal government has legislated that all upcoming elections, including by-polls, will be held through the EVMs, how can Punjab deviate from the law?” a senior government official wondered while talking to Dawn on Wednesday.
“The Punjab government now earnestly wants that the clause regarding use of EVMs in all upcoming elections be included in the PLGA 2021, which is currently in the finalisation stages,” the official added.
The federal government has already asked the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to hold all the next elections, including by-polls, through the EVMs. Federal Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry had also hinted that the government would not fund the commission if it did not hold the polls through the EVMs.
The commission, in the meanwhile, has asked the Punjab government to submit the draft amended PLGA 2021 in a week otherwise the LG polls would be held as per the law in vogue. “The ECP plans to delimit constituencies afresh according to the amended manuscript of the law, otherwise it will be compelled to hold elections as per the old delimitation of LG constituencies,” an ECP official explained.
The opposition parties, however, vehemently rejected the Punjab government’s plans to bulldoze the all-important legislation. They maintain the PLGA 2021 is being approved in an undemocratic way as no stakeholders have been consulted.
Even the PTI’s ally, the PML-Q, had previously raised objections and its minister, Muhammad Rizwan, had left the Punjab cabinet meeting after expressing his resentment that his party was not consulted.
Since Punjab Governor Chaudhry Sarwar is currently out of the country and Punjab Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Parvez Elahi is holding the acting charge of the governor, he called for a briefing on the proposed amendments to PLGA 2021.
Mr Elahi, who is also the PML-Q’s Punjab president, had sought that tehsil councils be made part of the local government system besides fixing qualification requirements for mayor and district council chairman.
The Punjab government sprang up to control the damage. The chief minister held a meeting with the provincial law and local government ministers and the local government secretary and reviewed the law as well as the objections raised by the PML-Q. The CM directed to continue consultations with the PML-Q and their objections be addressed, adding the new LG act had been drafted with consultations and hard work to empower the grassroots.
Sources claimed a Punjab government official delegation yet again met Mr Elahi and convinced him that tehsil councils could not be included in the law. Over the objection that at least intermediate education should be made mandatory for the mayor and district council chairman, the delegation informed the acting governor the qualification bar could not be included because there was no such requirement for MPAs and MNAs.
“Mr Elahi agreed with the government’s explanation, but said at least the word “preferably” be included in the law with regards to the qualification,” claimed a government official, who was part of the delegation.
Reacting to the proposed amendments to the law, PML-N Punjab information secretary Azma Bukhari said the PTI government did not bother consulting the opposition parties while preparing the all-important law. The government was doing legislation through special committees, while no discussion was allowed in the Punjab Assembly, she said, adding, “I was suspended from the assembly session when I tried to argue on the proposed law by the end of the last financial year.”
Regarding Punjab government’s plan to make the use of EVMs mandatory in the next elections, Ms Bukhari said, “Who are they to decide how elections should be held? This is the sole mandate of the ECP.”
PPP’s parliamentary leader Hasan Murtaza said the PTI government always did “bad legislation” without consulting the stakeholders. “It is a tragedy that the PTI government is trying to bring in an ordinance when the Punjab Assembly was there to legislate,” he remarked.
Mr Murtaza said the ruling party should take all parliamentary parties onboard and rectify their reservations. “It is strange that the PTI government is not giving importance to 50 per cent legislators in the Punjab Assembly,” he stressed.
Answering a question about the use of EVMs, he said PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had already rejected the government’s plan and move to threaten and pressurise the ECP. “The PTI government wants to repeat the history of [Results Transmission System] and was looking to get an extension through the use of EVMs,” he claimed.
On the other hand, PML-Q Punjab information secretary Mian Imran Masood says their party accepted the government’s proposal to use EVMs in elections after holding negotiations with the ruling PTI after the joint session of parliament had to be called off briefly owing to reservations of the government’s allied parties.
The PTI government had dissolved the local bodies constituted under the PLGA 2013 by promulgating the PLGA 2019 in May 2019 soon after coming to power. It had appointed LG administrators – some 30 months ahead of completion of the tenure of LG representatives mostly belonging to the PML-N.
However, the Usman Buzdar administration reluctantly restored the local governments in the province in October to comply with a Supreme Court order. The existing local governments’ tenure will expire on Dec 31.

1,IHC wants govt to compensate families of ‘missing’ persons,"• Court order says PM, cabinet are accountable for agencies’ actions • Minister asked to ensure ‘missing’ journalist’s family meet","• Court order says PM, cabinet are accountable for agencies’ actions
• Minister asked to ensure ‘missing’ journalist’s family meet premier before Dec 13
ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday proposed that the prime minister and the federal cabinet compensate the legal heirs of missing persons since they are responsible for the safety and security of citizens and oversee the intelligence and investigation agencies.
IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah during the hearing of the petition seeking recovery of missing journalist Mudassir Naaru, asked federal Minister for Human Rights Dr Shireen Mazari to suggest to the cabinet to consider the proposal of imposing cost on the respective chief executives in whose tenure the citizen went missing.
“The practice of enforced disappearances has existed in Pakistan over a considerable time. The existence of this phenomenon is intolerable in a society governed under the Constitution,” the court noted.
It further observed that enforced disappearance was “a crime against humanity and one of the most detestable manifestations of violation of fundamental rights”.
In the case of journalist Mudassar Mehmood, it has been asserted in the petition that he was also a social activist and human rights defender; he had been receiving threats, allegedly from officials of the state institutions before he went missing on August 19, 2018.
In October 2018, his father, the petitioner, approached the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances. The initiation of proceedings by the Commission led to the registration of a criminal case i.e. FIR No.208/2018 followed by the formation of a Joint Investigation Team (JIT).
The petitioner asserted that he was not kept informed regarding JIT’s proceedings nor its report was provided to him. From 2018 till the filing of the petition this year, the Commission has reportedly held several meetings/hearings.
According to the JIT, the person has gone ‘missing’ on his own.
Justice Minallah noted that the ‘missing’ person appeared to have been happily married, as he had taken his wife for a holiday when he went missing. His wife at the time was expecting and she gave birth to a child later. Now the child who is three years old has started attending court proceedings with his grandmother.
It appears from the record that the ‘missing’ person had loving parents who were unaware of the status of their son, whether he was alive or not, were exposed to unimaginable pain and agony, the court noted.
“Perusal of the reports submitted by the respondents show that all the agencies under the control of the federal government i.e. the Military Intelligence, Inter Services Intelligence, Federal Investigation Agency, etc. have taken the stance that they were neither involved nor have they any information regarding the whereabouts of the Missing Person,” IHC Chief Justice observed.
Minister for Human Rights Shireen Mazari explained in detail the measures being taken to combat the menace of ‘enforced disappearances’.
The court noted that in case of the phenomenon of enforced disappearances, the buck stops with the federal government i.e. the worthy prime minister and members of the federal cabinet.
The agencies alleged to be involved or complacent in deprivation of a citizen’s liberty without due process were controlled by the PM or the federal government and they were, therefore, responsible and ought to be held accountable for their actions, it added.
The court directed the minister for human rights to ensure the parents and child of the missing person meet the premier before December 13 and the matter shall thereafter be placed before the federal cabinet and the PM.
The IHC order stated the PM and the federal cabinet “shall direct all the agencies under their control to produce the missing person before this court or trace his whereabouts”.
“In case the missing person is not produced before this court nor his whereabouts are traced, then the federal cabinet shall ascertain the agencies and public functionaries responsible for the failure and inform this court regarding the action taken against them,” the order stated.
It further added that the attorney general would appear and assist the court regarding the “responsibility and liability of the federal government i.e. the worthy prime minister and members of the cabinet” in case the ‘missing’ person remained untraced till the next date of hearing.

2,Trade deficit hits all-time high in November,"Finance ministry believes increase in remittances, growth in export proceeds and RDAs will help reduce pressure.","ISLAMABAD: The month of November of the current fiscal year (FY22) saw a steep rise of 162.4 per cent in trade deficit which was driven largely by more than triple increase in imports compared to exports from the country.
The reversing trend in trade deficit was witnessed for the fifth consecutive month as merchandise trade deficit reached $5.107 billion in November against $1.946bn over the corresponding month last year, according to provisional data released on Wed­nesday. This is the highest trade deficit recorded in a single month in terms of value.
The current year started with a rising import bill which poses a serious threat putting pressure on the external side. The import bill in November reached an all-time high of $8.01bn from $4.12bn over the corresponding month last year, indicating an increase of 94.41pc.
Adviser to the Prime Minister on Commerce Razak Dawood said in a tweet that data on imports was being analysed and would be shared shortly. He only shared data on export proceeds in November to portray a positive image of his government.

 



 
The highest-ever increase in imports also helped the Federal Board of Revenue collect maximum revenue at import stage — sales tax, withholding tax and customs duty. However, the government’s battle against the bloated trade deficit is reversing and may cause pressure on the external side because of all-time high imports.
The first five months of the current fiscal year saw a rise of more than 117.25pc in trade deficit. The merchandise trade deficit rose to $20.746bn in July-November 2021 from $9.549bn over the corresponding months last year.
The Ministry of Finance believes that an increase in remittances, growth in export proceeds and Roshan Digital Accounts will help mitigate the pressure to a large extent.
Trade deficit had reached an all-time high of $37.7bn in FY18. However, government’s measures led to a drop in it to $31.8bn in FY19 and $23.183bn in FY20. The trend reversed and trade deficit stood at $30.796bn in FY21.
The trade gap has been widening since December last year, mainly led by exponential growth in imports and comparatively slow growth in exports. The import bill in July-November 2021 rose by 71.59pc to $33.111bn against $19.296bn over the corresponding months last year. In November 2021, the import bill edged up to $8.01bn from $4.12bn over the same month last year, reflecting an increase of 94.41pc.
One of the major initiatives of the government to encourage imports of raw materials also pushed up the import bill. Oil prices have also increased substantially, which pushed up the import bill because of high demand for energy in the domestic market.
A surge was noted in imports of vehicles, machinery as well as vaccines, pushing the import bill. In FY21, the import bill surged by 25.8pc to $56.091bn from $44.574bn the previous year.
Exports posted a growth year-on-year of 27pc to $12.365bn in July-November 2021 against $9.747bn over the corresponding months last year. In November 2021, exports saw a growth of 33pc to $2.903bn against $2.174bn over the same month last year.
Razak Dawood termed the growth in export proceeds in November a historic one, saying the export target for five months was $12.2bn. The monthly target for November was $2.6bn.
Export proceeds went up by 18.2pc to $25.294bn in FY21 from $21.394bn over the last year.

ISLAMABAD: The National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) on Wednesday decided to strictly implement the vaccination regime in the wake of the emergence of a new virulent Covid-19 variant, Omicron, that has spread in a number of countries.
As many as 40 call centres have been set up through which people who have skipped the second dose will be contacted while free booster doses are being administered to people who fall in the category of health workers, are over 50 years and are immunocompromised.
However, boosters can only be given after a period of six months since the last vaccine dose.
It has also been decided to deploy health teams at public spots to vaccinate individuals.
According to a statement, the NCOC discussed the pandemic’s curve chart data, national vaccine strategy and disease prevalence in the country.
The session was chaired by Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Asad Umar and co-chaired by National Coordinator Maj Gen Mohammad Zafar Iqbal. It was also attended by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health Dr Faisal Sultan while the provincial health ministers and chief secretaries took part in the session virtually.
“The forum was briefed about Covid-19 positivity ratio, disease prevalence, number of deaths and new admissions. It discussed in detail the overall city-wise Covid-19 vaccination process and agreed upon taking strict measures regarding obligatory vaccination regime. It was discussed during the meeting that the vaccination teams should be deployed at various public spots to vaccinate the individuals on the spot,” the statement said.
The NCOC said a special campaign would be run for implementation of the obligatory regime that started on Dec 1, and instructed the provinces and relevant authorities to adopt a zero tolerance policy with regards to obligatory vaccination regime.
The statement further said 40 call centres had been established to reach out to people who had not received their second jab.
Later, in their presentations, the provincial health ministers and chief secretaries briefed the forum about the initiatives taken to boost the vaccination campaign, improve testing numbers and set up call centres.
All provinces will start vaccination outreach campaign to achieve the immunisation targets.
According to the statement, the provincial representatives also emphasised the need for focussing on Omnicron, the new coronavirus variant, and suggested taking necessary measures at airports to check the vaccination status and testing of expatriates. “Basic SOPs, including wearing of masks, social distance and hand washing, should be ensured,” the statement added.
The NCOC data showed that nine people died and 414 more tested positive for Covid-19 over the last 24 hours. The number of active cases as of December 1 was recorded at 14,393 out of which 939 were admitted to hospitals across the country.

4,"Smugglers, money-launderers to be punished: PM Imran",Directs all stakeholders to undertake emergency measures and control smuggling of essential commodities with unique solutions.,"• Imran orders timely completion of CPEC projects
• Praises FBR for record revenue collection
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday ordered stern action against smugglers of sugar, wheat, urea and petrol and those involved in money laundering.
“Heavy damage is inflicted on the economy as a result of smuggling of food commodities due to price differential,” observed PM Khan at a meeting held to review measures against smuggling and money laundering.
“Smuggling creates an artificial shortage of commodities and ultimately results in price hike,” he remarked.
The meeting was attended by federal ministers Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, Hammad Azhar, Khusro Bakhtiar, Fakhar Imam, Asad Umar, advisers Shaukat Tarin, Abdul Razak Dawood, special assistant to the PM Dr Shehbaz Gill, State Bank governor, FBR chairman as well as senior civil and military officers.
The PM, who presided over the meeting, directed all stakeholders to undertake emergency measures and control smuggling of essential commodities with out-of-the-box solutions. He highlighted the need for provision of relief to common man against [unprecedented] price hike.
The meeting was informed that the Federal Investigation Authority (FIA) had undertaken extensive work against money laundering and illegal withholding of US dollars. Achievements to counter petrol smuggling and operations conducted against hoarders were also discussed in detail. The meeting was apprised of the measures taken to increase security at border crossings to check goods and ensure that each load was recorded for tracking purposes.
Just a day ago, Mr Khan and cabi­net members blamed the Sindh government for what they called “failing to control hoarding of sugar and urea”. They also held the provincial government responsible for hike in sugar and wheat prices.
CPEC projects
While chairing a separate meeting to review progress on China-Pakistan Economic Corridor projects, Prime Minister Khan asserted that timelines specified for the completion of CPEC projects must be adhered to.
“The government is fully committed to provisions of CPEC agreements,” he said, adding that continuity of policies was essential for long-term projects.
The prime minister said China had been a time-tested friend of Pakistan and that the government accorded high priority to implementation and operationalisation of CPEC projects.
Earlier, Special Assistant to the PM on CPEC Affairs Khalid Mansoor updated the meeting on the current status of CPEC projects.
FBR tax collection.
Earlier, the PM appreciated the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) on achieving an increase of 35 per cent in revenues of November 2021 compared with the same month the previous year.
“Congratulations to the FBR team for achieving a 35 per cent increase in revenues in November over last year,” Mr Khan tweeted.

 



 
The FBR a day ago claimed to have registered a “historic growth” in revenue collection of 36.5pc from July-November of the fiscal year 2021-22. “It has collected net revenues of Rs2,314 billion during the first five months of the current FY against set target of Rs2,016 billion, exceeding by Rs298 billion,” the FBR tweeted.
