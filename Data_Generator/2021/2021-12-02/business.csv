0,"ECC okays hike in profit margins of oil firms, dealers",Rejects a Rs10bn bailout package for Pakistan Railways.,"ISLAMABAD: Amid double-digit inflation recorded at 11.5 per cent in November, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet on Wednesday did not approve an additional subsidy on five essential kitchen items for two months and green-lighted an increase of 23-25pc in dealers’ and oil companies’ commission on petrol and diesel effective from Dec 16.
The brief meeting of the ECC presided over by Minister for Economic Affairs Omar Ayub Khan immediately stamped decisions taken by a technical committee led by Prime Minister’s Adviser on Finance and Revenue Shaukat Tarin but rejected a Rs10bn bailout package for Pakistan Railways.
Under a surrogate and interim arrangement to sidestep court rulings that bar unelected advisers to take government decisions, the government has created a technical committee of the ECC led by Mr Tarin which actually takes decisions on economic matters. Mr Tarin then exchanges the chair with Mr Omar while all others mostly remain seated to formally declare the technical committee’s decisions as approved.
Informed sources said the Ministry of Industries and Production had come up with a demand for a Rs5.6bn untargeted subsidy on five essential kitchen items for November and December under Prime Minister’s Relief Package through the Utility Stores Corporation (USC) to cope with rising inflationary trends.
The sources said the summary was rejected with the directive to also include the requirement for January and till then utilise USC’s own resources amid anticipation that inflationary pressures may slightly subside.
An official statement said the ECC approved the proposal submitted by the energy ministry for increasing the margins of oil marketing companies (OMCs) and dealers for motor spirit and high-speed diesel (HSD) with effect from the forthcoming revision in oil prices, i.e. on Dec 16.
The government already reached an agreement with petroleum dealers last week for increasing their sale margins when they went on a countrywide strike and created supply disruptions at retail outlets. Under the decision, the dealers’ margins would go up by 25.20pc and that of OMCs by 23.32pc on both products.
That means the dealers would now get Rs4.90 per litre on petrol instead of Rs3.91, showing an increase of 99 paise. In addition, they would get 83 paise per litre higher commission on HSD at Rs4.13 per litre instead of the existing rate of Rs3.30.
The OMCs would get an additional 71 paise per litre on both products, which means a profit of Rs3.68 per litre on both products compared to Rs2.97 at present.
The ECC also approved a summary presented by the Ministry of National Food Security and Research for buying 175,000 tonnes of imported wheat by the World Food Programme (WFP) from Passco’s stock for Pakistan and Afghanistan.
The meeting also green-lighted a summary of the poverty alleviation and social safety division for including beneficiaries of the Ehsaas Kafalat Programme with a proxy mean test score between 29.01 and 37 under the recent National Socio-Economic Registry survey in Ehsaas Emergency Cash Programme. Under the proposal, each beneficiary would be provided one-time emergency cash assistance of Rs12,000 on a first-come, first-served basis.
The ECC meeting also discussed the summaries of the ministry of industries on contractual obligations of the Heavy Electrical Complex and the exemption of duties and taxes for an uninterrupted supply of oxygen in the country for medical purposes and directed for revised summaries.

1,Ministry agrees to in-camera briefing on $4.2bn Saudi package,It has already disclosed the $3bn deposit and oil facility from S. Arabia entails interest rate of 4pc and 3.8pc respectively.,"ISLAMABAD: The Standing Committee of the National Assembly on Finance and Revenue on Wednesday called for not treating tax evasion under the provisions of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) law under the premise of Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and sought a briefing on the terms of $4.2 billion Saudi balance-of-payment support package.
The meeting of the committee presided over by PTI MNA Faiz Ullah noted that business community was facing serious problems because of AML and its enforcement agencies which needed to be addressed on priority.
On a point raised by PPP’s Dr Nafisa Shah for details of the Saudi package, the Director-General Debt Office of the Ministry of Finance agreed to give an in-camera briefing to the standing committee because of sensitivities of the bilateral relationship.
Dr Shah said there were a lot of news reports on terms and conditions of the Saudi package that also included $1.2bn in oil facility under deferred payment mechanism. She wanted a briefing on the subject by the finance ministry and the State Bank of Pakistan.
Interestingly, the finance ministry has already disclosed that the $3bn deposit and oil facility from Saudi Arabia entailed interest rate of 4pc and 3.8pc respectively. The rates are higher than previous $6bn Saudi package in 2018 that was available at 3.2pc which could not be fully utilised and was partially withdrawn amid unease in bilateral relations.
The committee discussed problems faced by business community due to AML laws and its implementation by enforcement agencies. DG Investigation Customs FBR Abdul Rashid Shaikh explained that investigation and prosecutions were carried out for tax crimes based on preliminary data of suspicious transactions reports (STRs) of financial fraud and smuggling.
He reported that 170 investigations and 44 prosecutions had taken place between 2018 and 2021 but there was no conviction as yet. He, however, hoped solid evidence available in some cases would lead to convictions in the courts.
FBR chairman Ashfaque Ahmad believed that AML and subsequent investigations and prosecutions had created reasonable deterrence.
Mr Faiz Ullah said that business community’s concern was that FIRs were being registered before any assessment and tax evasion had been brought under the jurisdiction of AML law which was a very dangerous sign because the size of the undocumented economy was greater than formal economy. He said the tax evasion should be treated and proceeded under the tax law and not under AML laws.
The FBR chairman said the major focus of the tax authorities was on revenue collection but the AML law was passed by the parliamentarians which granted powers to the FBR due to requirements of the FATF.
Another FBR official told the committee that first conviction in tax crime was in Peshawar recently even though more than 100 petitions were still pending. It was reported that Inland Revenue had registered 215 FIRs against 267 persons and Rs235bn worth of assets had been attached with the permission of courts, involving Rs76bn revenue impact.
The committee also discussed Federal Government Properties Management Authority Bill 2021 in detail but deferred it for next meeting as members expressed reservations whether all stakeholders were taken on board before its approval from the cabinet.

2,Trading in BlueEX shares set to begin on Dec 6,"KARACHI: Trading in the shares of logistics firm Unive­rsal Network Systems Ltd, which operates under the brand ...","KARACHI: Trading in the shares of logistics firm Unive­rsal Network Systems Ltd, which operates under the brand name of BlueEX, will start from Dec 6, a notice on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) said on Wednesday.
BlueEX will be the second firm to list on the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) board, which is a newly launched counter on the PSX reserved for “growth companies” carrying higher investment and liquidity risks than mature companies listed on the main board.
The opening price will be Rs65 per share, which is the fixed rate at which the company sold its 25 per cent stake to raise Rs446 million on Nov 17-18. With the trading symbol of GEMUNSL, the scrip will be quoted in the transport sector of the PSX.
Trading in the shares of Pak Agro Packaging Ltd, which marked the maiden listing on the GEM board, began on Nov 26. It had raised Rs198m by selling a 40 per cent post-listing stake to “accredited investors”.
According to the BlueEX’s chief financial officer Salman Hameed, the share of the logistics firm in the country’s ecommerce market is 6-8pc. The company raised fresh equity to expand its infrastructure. Its revenue went up 67pc to Rs157.48m in 2020-21. The company posted a net profit of Rs33.22m, up 16.5 times from a year ago.
Major players operating in the courier segment include TCS with a market share of 25pc, followed by M&P (15pc), Leopards (12pc), Trax (11pc), Call Courier (10pc), Movex (4pc), Rider (4pc) and “others” (13pc), according to the company’s information memorandum.
The exchange doesn’t allow all investors to trade on the GEM board because the firms listed on this counter are supposed to be riskier than main-board constituents. Therefore, an individual must “self-declare” themselves as an accredited investor if they want to trade in GEM-listed securities. Accredited individual investors are those who have “net assets” of at least Rs5m in the system of National Clearing Company of Pakistan Ltd.
This condition makes a majority of roughly 300,000 individual stock investors ineligible to trade shares in GEM-listed companies. Meanwhile, stockbrokers are finding it difficult to ascertain whether an individual should be “tick-marked” as an accredited investor.
AKD Securities CEO Farid Alam said complying with the requirement of net assets amounting to Rs5m for accredited investors is “cumbersome” for the brokerage community. “Assets they can see. If a customer has Rs5m or beyond investments, the brokerage can say they are an accredited or qualified investor. But the brokerage community is not really comfortable with the word ‘net’. That requires a lot more details.”

3,Banks’ housing exposure limit increased to 25pc,Govt and SBP have been striving to boost housing and construction industry but banks are reluctant to extend housing loans.,"KARACHI: In a major move to boost house financing, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Wednesday increased the limit of banks’ exposure to housing and construction to 25 per cent from 15pc of their aggregate advances and investments.
On July 15, 2020 banks and DFIs were advised to achieve mandatory financing targets for housing and construction of buildings (residential and non-residential) equivalent to at least 5 per cent of their domestic private sector advances by Dec 31.
In order to increase funding for housing and construction through capital markets and microfinance banks (MFBs), the SBP decided to allow counting exposures of banks and DFIs towards achievement of their housing and construction finance mandatory targets.
The banks were allowed direct financing or investments in bonds, TFCs and sukuk issued by Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) management companies.
Banks were told to make investments in units or shares issued by REITs subject to compliance with all other applicable regulations.
They were allowed to invest in sukuk or bonds issued by Pakistan Mortgage Refinance Company (PMRC). However, investment in sukuk or bonds and amount of refinancing availed from PMRC will be netted off towards counting the mandatory target.
Financing to microfinance banks (MFBs) for extending housing finance to eligible borrowers to the extent of actual disbursements by MFBs. Banks extending financing to MFBs for housing finance will have to report such transactions to SBP separately.
The central bank said the above exposures will be considered on aggregate basis up to a maximum of 15pc of mandatory targets for housing and construction finance of a bank or DFI on a given date.
However, the new circular issued on Wednesday increased the exposure limit to 25pc.
“The exposure limit on eligible investments and financing has been increased to 25pc of mandatory targets for housing and construction finance from 15pc of the same,” said the circular.
The government and the SBP have been striving to boost the housing and construction industry but the banks are reluctant to extend housing loans.
On July 6, the SBP decided to impose penalty on banks if they fail to meet the mandatory targets for number of houses and disbursement.
“It has been decided that penalty will be imposed on banks falling short of their targets with effect from July 31 on both targets of number of housing units and amount of disbursements,” said the SBP.
The government’s prime agenda was to provide 10 million jobs and five million low-cost housing units but after three years there is no visible achievement in this direction.
