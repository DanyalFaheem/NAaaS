0,Alex Carey ‘given nod’ as Australia keeper but rain ruins Ashes build-up,He has featured in limited-overs cricket for Australia and stood in as ODI skipper in the West Indies this year.,"BRISBANE: Alex Carey looks poised to replace Tim Paine as Australia’s wicket-keeper for the Ashes against England and make his Test debut, as more bad weather Wednesday wrecked preparations for both teams.
Paine quit as Test captain and then last week stepped away from cricket over a text-message scandal, leaving selectors seeking an alternative ahead of the December 8 first Test.
Carey and fellow gloveman Josh Inglis were widely seen as in a showdown for the role and a decision was expected after a scheduled three-day intra-squad match featuring both of them in Brisbane. 
But day one was washed out on Wednesday and reports said Inglis had returned home to Perth. 
The Sydney Morning Herald said the 30-year-old Carey had been “given the nod”, sentiments echoed by broadcaster ABC, which said he was  “expected to be named Australian wicketkeeper”.Carey has featured in limited-overs cricket for Australia and stood in as ODI skipper in the West Indies this year, but he has never played a Test match. 
He insisted on Wednesday he had not spoken with selectors. 
“Selection is totally out of my control now. It’s something that I shouldn’t waste time worrying about,” Carey told RSN radio. “If I am lucky enough to get the opportunity, I’d feel really proud and grateful... a young kid’s dream come true.” 
Cricket Australia confirmed on Wednesday that Inglis had returned to Western Australia. Inglis is set to return to Brisbane after his trip to see family — but for an Australia ‘A’ tour match rather than the first Test at the Gabba ground. 
All-rounder Cameron Green, who is set to start for Australia in the Ashes at number six, said Carey’s experience in one-day cricket will help him make the adjustment to Test cricket. 
“Alex has been around for quite a while now in that international set-up and I’m sure all the confidence he’s gained from playing all the one-dayers will hold him in good stead,” Green told reporters in Queensland on Wednesday. 
“The experience that he brings, he’s got a really good record in one-day cricket, he’s really held that position down really well.” 
Green made his own test debut in Adelaide during the India series last December, going on to average 33.71 over four Tests with a high score of 84.
While he has confirmed his talent with the bat for Western Australia this season, the 22-year-old seamer will go into his fifth Test next week still seeking his first wicket. 
Persistent rain has badly hampered both teams’ preparations for the five-Test series, with Australia also needing to decide between Usman Khawaja and Travis Head after incumbent number five Matthew Wade was axed from the squad.
The rain-hit warm-up match had been billed as a chance for them to impress selectors. 
England have also suffered from the weather with a three-day practice match washed out last week, bar 29 overs. 
No play was possible on the opening day of their final four-day clash on Tuesday, and the rain again meant only an optional indoor session was possible on Wednesday. 
Rory Burns and Haseeb Hameed, along with spinner Dom Bess, are the only members of their Ashes party to have any match practice since the tour started.

1,West Indies leading despite Ramesh Mendis’ six wickets,Sri Lanka were 46-2 in its second innings at close having conceded a 49-run first innings lead to the visitors.,"GALLE: Off-spinner Ramesh Mendis fuelled a Sri Lankan fightback with a maiden five-wicket haul but the West Indies still led by three runs in the second innings at stumps on the third day of the second Test on Wednesday. 
Sri Lanka were 46-2 in its second innings at close having conceded a 49-run first innings lead to the visitors, who were bowled out for 253.  
Captain Dimuth Karunaratne (6) was run out to a brilliant direct hit from Kyle Mayers and Oshada Fernando (14) was also run out after being turned back by non-striker Pathum Nissanka.. Nissanka was batting on 21 with Charith Asalanka on 4. 
With Angelo Mathews out with a hamstring injury, losing two early wickets was a massive blow for Sri Lanka. They have never lost a home Test to West Indies. 
Earlier, off-spinner Mendis belatedly found his line and length, dismissing Nkrumah Bonner to end his 75-run stand with West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite. 
It broke a two-session drought for Mendis, who then ran through the tourists’ middle order, ending with figures of 6-70 as the West Indies were all out after tea.
The West Indies fell apart against the bounce of the new ball, though Mendis was denied a seventh wicket when wicketkeeper Dinesh Chandimal dropped Kemar Roach on eight. 
Left-arm spinner Lasith Embuldeniya dismissed Brathwaite with a ball pitched on leg-stump that turned away sharply from the right-hander to clip the top of off-stump. 
The West Indies, who have yet to win a Test match in Sri Lanka, were looking at a decent total and a considerable first-innings lead when they finished on 145-2 at lunch.
Brathwaite’s straightforward footwork and impregnable defence were a vital bulwark for the West Indies after two top-order collapses in the first Test. 
The skipper cashed in when loose balls were on offer and was relentless against Sri Lanka’s two left-arm spinners, forcing the hosts to recalibrate to boundary protection. 
But the slide started when Brathwaite was dismissed 72.  
Mendis had Roston Chase (10) caught at leg slip by Asalanka and trapped Shai Hope (22) lbw. 
Jason Holder (4) unsuccessfully reviewed an lbw decision against him because a ball delivered by Mendis appeared to bounce over the stumps. In the next ball, Joshua da Silva played through the wrong line expecting a ball from Mendis to turn more than it did and was bowled. His fall left the West Indies 197-7. 
Mayers (36 not out) with Roach ensured that the West Indies took a lead in the first innings and extended it in a 38-run partnership for the ninth wicket with Veerasammy Permaul.

2,‘New Zealand have self-belief to upset India’,"“The beauty about this team at the moment is we don’t really look at history too much. We look at the present,"" says Patel.","MUMBAI: New Zealand are confident they can pull off an upset win against hosts India in the second and final Test in Mumbai to complete a historic series victory, the team’s leading spinner Ajaz Patel said on Wednesday.
Mumbai-born Patel, whose parents immigrated to New Zealand in 1996, kept his side in the hunt for a series win after sharing a last-wicket stand with debutant Rachin Ravindra in the first test to see out the final 52 balls for a thrilling draw.
It meant the reigning world test champions, who have never won a test series in India let alone a test match since the 1988/89 tour, have arrived in Mumbai brimming with confidence.
“For us, it’s still going into a game with the possibility of taking the series and we know the history around playing cricket in India, we know how difficult it has been in the past,” Patel told reporters.
“The beauty about this team at the moment is we don’t really look at history too much. We look at the present.
“We have the sense of self-belief that we can cause upsets anywhere and we’ve done that recently to kind of be able to take the World Test Championship.”
Both teams were forced to cancel their training sessions on Wednesday due to unseasonal rain and Patel said his team mates would not mind an extra day’s rest.
The 33-year-old left-arm spinner, who expects a lot of family members in the stands during the test, said adapting to the Wankhede Stadium pitch will be the key for New Zealand.
“I guess the red clay has a bit more bounce and pace,” said Patel, who has rolled his arm over at a few practice sessions in the past at the stadium for the Indian Premier League side Mumbai Indians.
“We’ve just got to assess the wicket that’s given to us and how it’s responding, and we’ve got to set up a game plan according to that now.
“The beauty about Indian conditions is that you have to adapt very quickly and we know how good these guys are at playing spin, how adept they are in their home conditions. So it is a great challenge and something we look forward to.”

3,Jack Leach sniffs Ashes chance with Ben Stokes return,"Along with Stokes, England have brought another seam-bowling all-rounder in their squad in Chris Woakes.","MELBOURNE: England are beaming with the return of Ben Stokes for the Ashes but few players could be happier than spinner Jack Leach, who sees the pugnacious all-rounder as his own ticket back into the Test set-up.
Stokes’ absence through the home summer also saw Leach left out in the cold with selectors preferring seam-heavy attacks for “team balance” against New Zealand and for most of the truncated India series.
Along with Stokes, England have brought another seam-bowling all-rounder in their squad in Chris Woakes, boosting Leach’s hopes of playing a meaningful part in the five-Test series starting in Brisbane in a week. 
“From the summer, the feedback was that Stokesy not being in the side, not having that all-round option in the top order, kind of made things difficult for me to get in the side,” Leach told reporters on Wednesday. 
“So I think having him back is great. Also having [Chris] Woakes back ... both of them back is hopefully positive for being able to fit a spinner in, for sure.” 
Left-armer Leach was England’s most successful bowler over the winter with 28 wickets against India and Sri Lanka, but the 30-year-old Somerset man has not played a test since Ahmedabad in March, which was also Stokes’ last appearance. 
The pair shared in one of the highlights of the drawn 2019 Ashes series, when Stokes smashed an unbeaten 135 at Headingley and number 11 Leach survived 17 balls to finish one not out and help England snatch a thrilling one-wicket win. 
Leach said he could never get tired of hearing about his unbeaten one but hopes to add new Ashes highlights. 
“Im not fed up with the one not out. I dont think I ever will be but I guess I want to keep performing for England, that’s what it comes down to,” he said.
Australia has never been a spinner’s paradise but Leach has admired Nathan Lyon’s ability to coax so many wickets from its hard pitches and admitted trying to add a few of the veteran’s tricks to his repertoire. 
Leach also spotlighted Ravindra Jadeja as an inspiration after the Indian’s exploits during a Test series in Australia last summer. 
“For years I’ve watched Nathan Lyon and he’s very impressive,” said Leach. “Just how strong his stock ball is and on wickets that don’t necessarily offer a lot spin wise he’s found ways to extract extra bounce, dip and all the other things. 
“They’re the kind of things that I’ve been trying to add in but still sticking to my strengths as well.” 
Watching fellow left-arm spinner Jadeja has also been part of his preparation during England’s rain-hit build-up to the five-Test series. 
“I don’t think [Jadeja] did too much different to what he does in India,” said Leach, who has played 16 Tests, taking 62 wickets, but none in Australia. “That’s another nice thing to see. He’s taken what he does, is doing pretty similar things and having success.”

Struggling for form and fitness this year, Konta dropped to 113th in the world and played her last tour match at the Cincinnati Open in August, suffering a first-round loss to Karolina Muchova.
The Briton withdrew from Wimbledon in June when a member of her team tested positive for Covid-19. She also missed the Tokyo Olympics after contracting the virus.
“Grateful — this is the word that I’ve probably used the most during my career, and is the word that I feel explains it best at the end,” Konta said in a statement on Twitter.

5,Pound fires back at critics of IOC’s video call with Peng Shuai,LAUSANNE: Senior International Olympic Committee (IOC) member Dick Pound on Tuesday denied the organisation vouched...,"LAUSANNE: Senior International Olympic Committee (IOC) member Dick Pound on Tuesday denied the organisation vouched for the safety of Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai to avoid angering 2022 Olympic host Beijing.
The whereabouts of Peng, a former doubles world number one, became a matter of international concern for nearly three weeks after she posted a message on social media alleging that China’s former Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli had sexually assaulted her.
On Nov 21, IOC President Thomas Bach had a 30-minute video call with Peng — a three-times Olympian who supporters say may be under political duress — during which she told him she was safe and with family and friends.
But Human Rights Watch said the IOC’s interest seemed to be to keep the Games on track, not the welfare of athletes, a suggestion Pound vehemently denied.
“That’s complete nonsense ... there was generalised concern about what may or may not have happened to her,” Pound, the IOC’s longest serving member, said in a telephone interview from Montreal.
“So what the IOC did was very quietly put a little bit of an Olympic network together with our president, the chair of our Athletes’ Commission, one of our senior members in China and they got in touch with her and she was happy to be on the call.”
Human Rights Watch China director Sophie Richardson, at a briefing last week, criticised Bach for failing to make clear publicly whether he had asked Peng if she had access to a lawyer or wanted to file charges around serious sexual assault claims.
“From an Olympic point of view, having accomplished what the objective was, which was to say ‘are you OK?’, and their collective conclusion was that she was OK and not under duress and that’s what we wanted to know,” said Pound.
“Now the others are all saying ‘you should have solved the harassment problem.’ On a 30-minute phone call? These things take ages to get resolved no mater what country you are in.”
Peng’s case has increased calls for a diplomatic boycott of the Games from rights groups and others already critical of Beijing over its policies in Hong Kong and treatment of minority Muslims, which the United States says amounts to genocide.
US President Joe Biden has said Washington is considering such a boycott, under which US officials would not attend the opening or closing ceremonies.

6,"Waheed, Imran grab share of lead at Chairman JCSC Golf",KARACHI: Three days after running eventual winner Shabbir Iqbal close in the final round of the Sindh Governor’s...,"KARACHI: Three days after running eventual winner Shabbir Iqbal close in the final round of the Sindh Governor’s Cup, Waheed Baloch was on top of his long-time rival at the Engro Chairman JCSC Golf Championship on Wednesday. 
It’s just early days though. For Waheed the first-round lead will only count if he’s atop the leaderboard at the end of the fourth round. 
“I was consistent and I think I did well,” Waheed told Dawn, while reflecting on his Governor’s Cup performance where he was just two strokes behind Shabbir going into the final nine holes only to end fourth. “… but the others played even better.” 
At the Karachi Golf Club — his parent club — on Wednesday, Waheed posted the best score in opening round with a four-under 68 seeing him grab a share of the lead alongside Mohammad Imran thanks to a superb back-nine performance in which he went bogey-free and fired four birdies.Those came on the 10th, 12th, 16th and 17th holes after a birdie on the third was cancelled out by a bogey on the ninth.“I had a good outing today, carrying the momentum gained from the last tournament,” Waheed said. “I have to keep this going.” 
There is added incentive for Waheed to win with the championship’s title sponsor being his sponsor. Then, there is also a Rs10 million prize money at stake — the highest amount for a Pakistan Golf Federation tour event. 
“Of course that is a motivation,” Matloob Ahmed, who also fired five birdies on Monday and is a shot shy of the lead, told Dawn.  
Matloob comes into the championship in “confident mood” on the back of a strong performance at the Governor’s Cup where he finished just a stroke adrift of Shabbir. Shabbir is alongside him on 69 after the opening round here. 
Minhaj Maqsood, who caused a stir when he finished third at the Governor’s Cup — his first event of the tour in three years, is two shots off the lead alongside Mohammad Alam, Mohammad Zubair, Mohammad Khalid and Shahbaz Masih. 
Five other golfers finished on one-under with Mohammad Munir among a group of 11 who were at even-par. Another 11 golfers, including Ahmed Baig, finished the day at one-over. 
Ahmed — touted as one of Pakistan’s rising golf stars — has been off-colour in recent tournaments and a bogey on the 17th dented his chances of finishing on 72. 
“My swing isn’t working at the moment … I’m struggling with the iron shots,” Ahmed told Dawn. “It was a tough day out there with most of my tee shots landing the rough. But there are still three rounds to play and I’ll look to move into contention.”

7,14 games and counting without an EPL win for Newcastle,LONDON: Newcastle United’s agonising wait for a first win in the Premier League this season is heading into...,"LONDON: Newcastle United’s agonising wait for a first win in the Premier League this season is heading into December. 
It’s 14 games and counting without a victory for the northeast club, which recently came under Saudi ownership, after a 1-1 draw at home to Norwich City that pitted the bottom two teams in the league against each other on Tuesday. 
A point does little for either side’s hopes of beating the drop as Leeds United’s 1-0 win over Crystal Palace moved them five points clear of the bottom three.
Newcastle, who are in last place, became the fourth team to fail to win any of their first 14 matches in a Premier League campaign, according to Opta, the league’s statistics supplier. The previous three Swindon Town (1993-94), Queens Park Rangers (2012-13) and Sheffield United (last season) all went on to get relegated. 
The visit of Norwich represented perhaps Newcastle’s best chance of securing that elusive win, yet a ninth-minute red card for centre-back Ciaran Clark for bringing down Teemu Pukki when last man left Eddie Howe’s team with an uphill task at St. James’ Park.
Even a man down, Newcastle looked the more dangerous team and took the lead in the 61st minute when Callum Wilson converted a penalty after Federico Fernandez’s header struck the raised hand of Billy Gilmour. 
Pukki equalised in the 79th with a left-footed volley into the top corner. 
“It’s a missed opportunity,” Newcastle midfielder Jonjo Shelvey said. We defended brilliantly throughout everyone to a man worked their socks off. “It’s unfortunate the red card early doors gave us a mountain to climb.”
Newcastle, who are on seven points, moved to within two points of Burnley, who have played two games fewer. Norwich are a point further ahead and unbeaten in three games since Dean Smith was hired as manager to replace Daniel Farke. 
Leeds gave themselves some breathing space from the bottom three by edging out Palace in stoppage time thanks to Raphinha’s penalty. 
Palace wasted the biggest chance of the game from open play when Christian Benteke headed Wilfried Zaha’s pinpoint cross wide. 
Leeds got the break their season needed deep into added time when Marc Guehi handled from Liam Cooper’s header and Raphinha coolly slotted home the resulting spot-kick to move Marcelo Bielsa’s men up to 15th.

Massimiliano Allegri’s side came in for fierce criticism over the last week after a 4-0 Champions League hammering away to Chelsea and a 1-0 defeat by Atalanta, their fifth league loss of the season, but they responded at the Stadio Arechi.
Paulo Dybala had lashed home the opener in the 21st minute after a neat one-two with Dejan Kulusevski but Salernitana were inches away from an equaliser when Luca Ranieri hit the post after the break.
With the home side in the ascendancy, Morata came off the bench and doubled Juve’s lead by deftly flicking home a cross in the 70th minute, before Dybala missed a penalty with the final kick of the game as he lost his footing on the wet turf. 
“Juventus has given so much to all of us and there are moments in life when it is time to give back. Now we need to stay close to this club, and we will come out of it together,” Juve captain Giorgio Chiellini told DAZN. 
Juventus remain seventh with 24 points from 15 games, seven adrift of the top-four and 11 behind leaders Napoli, while Salernitana are bottom with eight points. 
It has been a difficult week for Juves on and off the pitch, as the team suffered two straight defeats and on Saturday Italian finance police searched the clubs offices as part of an ongoing investigation into player trading. 
Earlier, Atalanta notched up a fourth league win in a row and moved provisionally level on 31 points with third-placed Inter Milan after a Mario Pasalic hat-trick fired them to a resounding 4-0 win over relegation battling Venezia in Bergamo. 
Pasalic scored his first two goals in the opening 12 minutes and added the other in the 67th, shortly after Teun Koopmeiners had netted the home team’s third. 
Dusan Vlahovic scored his seventh goal in five matches as sixth-placed Fiorentina came from behind to beat Sampdoria 3-1 in Florence, while mid-table Hellas Verona were held to a 0-0 draw by second-bottom Cagliari.

Their 7-6 (12-10), 7-6 (7-5) win in Innsbruck sealed a remarkable comeback for the Germans, who avenged their defeat at the same stage of the competition by Britain in 2019. 
Dan Evans had given Britain the lead by thrashing Peter Gojowczyk 6-2, 6-1 in the first singles. 
But Jen-Lennard Struff then kept Germany alive in the last-eight clash with an inspired performance to defeat world number 12 Cameron Norrie. 
Struff won 7-6 (8-6), 3-6, 6-2 to send the tie into the deciding doubles rubber which proved a nerve-jangling affair. 
The German pair saved four set points on their way to winning the first set in a remarkable tiebreak in which they claimed it on their fourth set point.
They were then 5-0 down in the second tiebreak of the match but reeled off seven consecutive points to seal the win and set up a semi-final against either Russia or Sweden in Madrid. Croatia will face either Serbia or Kazakhstan in the other semi-final.
Germany only needed one match point with Puetz firing an unstoppable return down the line to spark celebrations among the players and support staff even if there were no fans inside the Olympiahalle because of Austria’s Covid-19 lockdown. 
“It’s great, it’s an unbelievable feeling,” Germany captain Michael Kohlmann said. “We had super team chemistry.” 
Krawietz, twice a French Open doubles champion, said: “I am super happy that we’re going to Madrid. The box was unbelievably loud — it pushed us a lot and super happy to make it to the semi-finals. This is an incredible team achievement. We have a great atmosphere in the team from day one.” 
Germany have won the Davis Cup three times but not since 1993. 
“We have done everything to win,” Struff said. “We hope our journey goes on and the next goal is to win the semi-final.” 
Britain were seeking their fourth semi-final berth in the last six editions of the tournament. They last won the event in 2015. 
“Everyone is gutted, this is a tough day to swallow,” Britain team captain Leon Smith said. “It could have gone either way, but it wasn’t to be today. They gave their best effort but sometimes that is not enough, and Germany deserve to go through.”

15,Pakistan’s netball players eye World Cup glory,Pakistan has one of the leading men’s netball teams in Asia.,"KARACHI: The sound of every move by Pakistan’s top netball players echoes at the indoor court here at the Pakistan Sports Board Coaching Centre.
It’s the final of the National Inter-department Netball Championship but it’s being played by men. 
Netball — a no-contact version of basketball — is largely a women’s game.
Pakistan, though, has one of the leading men’s netball teams in Asia. In 2017, the team narrowly lost to India in the final of the Asian Championship.
And its players are yearning for a chance to play at the World Cup.The inaugural edition of the Men’s and Mixed Netball World Cup was due to be held in October 2020 in Australia but had to be cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
The next edition is slated to be held in 2023 with Australia — where men’s netball is very popular — due to host it again.
“We’ve shown at the Asian Championship that our team is really good,” Pakistan captain Mohammad Akhtar told Dawn on Wednesday after his Pakistan Air Force side lost the final.
“After this championship we have our national team camp [in February] where we will begin training for the World Cup. With our past performances, we are confident and will try our best to win it.”
Netball isn’t played at the Olympics but the women’s tournament features at the Commonwealth Games.
The Pakistan Netball Federation has started an elite netball development programme to raise the standard of its women’s team but it’s the men’s team which is making waves.
“The three-day inter-department event is to help nurture top men’s talent in the country”, PNF president Mudassar Arain told Dawn.
And it’s been very competitive too. Reigning champions Army were stunned by PAF in their opening match of the tournament.
But they reigned supreme at the end, avenging that defeat with a 34-23 victory in the final.
“We were not ready in our first game but in the final we made sure we didn’t repeat the same mistakes,” Pakistan Army captain Rana Zahid told Dawn.
