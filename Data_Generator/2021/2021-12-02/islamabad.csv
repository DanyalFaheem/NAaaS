0,FDE school teachers take to the streets today,"Boycott of classes will continue till govt withdraws decision of placing 390 schools under MCI, teachers’ body representative...","ISLAMABAD: Education crisis in the capital seems to be deepening as the protesting teaching and non-teaching staff of 390 schools are set to take to the streets from Thursday (today) against the proposed placement of schools under the yet-to-be formed local government.
On the other hand, around 200,000 students, who have already faced considerable loss during earlier closure of schools due to the Covid-19 pandemic, are suffering as a result of the strike.
The teachers will stage a protest outside the National Press Club before moving towards the Parliament House. The schools’ principals on Wednesday also allowed their staff to use school buses to reach the protest venue.
Representatives of the teachers’ community said that the federal government through Local Government Ordinance, 2021 had decided to place all schools under the Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI) after the local government elections, adding that they would not work under the corporation. 

Boycott of classes will continue till govt withdraws decision of placing 390 schools under MCI, teachers’ body representative says

Boycott of classes will continue until the government withdraws the Ordinance, they said, adding that they would give the government a few days to reverse the decision and if it did not, they would stage a sit-in next week for an indefinite period.
The local government elections are likely to be held in March-April in Islamabad and the elected mayor will assume charge of reporting officer of the director general of Federal Directorate of Education (FDE), which is the regulatory body of 390 schools of Islamabad.
Until, Nov 22, the FDE was supposed to regulate 423 schools and colleges however, the Ministry of Education through a notification placed 33 colleges under Education College to keep them a part of the ministry.
Chairman of the Action Committee Fazal Mola and Vice Chairman Malik Ameer Khan said until the government withdrew the said ordinance, schools would remain closed.
They said that the local government had nothing to do with education and the education sector should remain part of the education ministry, adding that the local government could not handle the huge manpower and budgetary requirement of FDE-run schools as every year, the federal government spends billions of rupees on development and non development expenditure.
“In its last tenure, we saw that the mayor was unable to pay salaries to sanitation staff, so how is it that the new mayor will ensure smooth funding for the education sector? This is something unacceptable; why is the government disturbing the education sector? The prime minister should look into this issue,” said president of School Teachers Association Malik Ameer Khan.
He said the local government has no capacity to deal with the education sector, adding, “We will not allow the government to do experiments with the education sector, which has been running smoothly”.

According to police officials, the robbers were aged between 30 to 35 years. Despite presence of heavy security in the street, which is home to several other influential officials, the robbers were able to break into Mr Ansari’s residence and escape with the loot unnoticed. 
A case was registered with Kohsar police station and investigation is underway. So far, the officials said, the investigation had revealed that the suspects were travelling in a black Toyota Corolla with a fake registration number issued by Lahore Excise and Taxation Office.
Footage from the Safe City cameras revealed that the robbers entered the capital from Rawalpindi, using Murree Road and reached F-7/3, police said, adding that footage from cameras installed in the street was also being examined.
The robbers not only carried out the robbery but challenged the capital police by targeting a protected street in the city, the police officials said.

3,Counsel seeks medical board to determine Zahir’s mental health,ISLAMABAD: The counsel for Zahir Jaffer filed an application before the additional district and sessions judge ...,"ISLAMABAD: The counsel for Zahir Jaffer filed an application before the additional district and sessions judge (ADSJ) on Wednesday seeking constitution of a medical board to ascertain the mental health of the alleged murderer.
ADSJ Atta Rabbani resumed proceeding of the trial of the prime accused in Noor Mukadam murder case.
Advocate Sikandar Zulqarnain Saleem, counsel for Zahir, contended in the application that the accused was a chronic patient of mental disorder or schizoaffective disorder due to drug psychosis and the same was the position at the time of his arrest on July 20, the ill-fated day when he murdered Noor Mukadam.
The counsel requested the court to authorise setting up of a medical board to determine the lunacy and mental health of Zahir Jaffer in the interest of justice.
The application stated that the judge himself observed the demeanour, conduct and state of mind of the accused during his appearance before the court.
Zahir had disrupted proceedings during a hearing of the case on Nov 3, hurling obscenities at Judge Rabbani who had then directed the police officials to take him away. Video footage of the incident showed policemen dragging Zahir out of the courtroom.
The judge had warned Zahir in a written order that his court appearances would be disallowed if he continued his outbursts and did not rectify his behaviour. Zahir was expelled from the court once again on Nov 10 after he disrupted proceedings for witness cross-examinations.
Noor Mukadam, 27, the daughter of former diplomat Shaukat Mukadam, was found beheaded at a residence in Islamabad’s upscale F-7/4 neighbourhood on July 20.
Jaffer was arrested from the crime scene on the day of the murder and has been in custody since then.
At his indictment hearing in October, Jaffer admitted he had committed the “crime” but appealed to the judge to release him from jail and put him under house arrest.
The transcript of the CCTV footage showing events that preceded Mukadam’s murder was submitted by the prosecution last month.
It said the victim had jumped from the first floor of Zahir’s house but was prevented by the staff from leaving the premises.
Others charged in the case include Jaffer’s parents, Zakir Jaffer and Asmat Adamjee, three of their household staff Iftikhar, Jan Mohammad and Jameel and six workers from Therapyworks, a counselling centre from where Jaffer had received certification to become a therapist and where he had been receiving treatment in the weeks leading up to the murder.

4,NDMA lacked preparedness to counter Covid-19: AGP,Auditors point out irregularities in procurement during pandemic...,"ISLAMABAD: The Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) has not only pointed out financial irregularities in the procurement and storage by National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) during the coronavirus pandemic mainly in 2020, but found the authority unprepared to timely devise a counter strategy.
The audit report on the expenditure incurred on Covid-19 by federal government has stated that the authority had failed to upgrade the national plan on annual basis, which is required under National Disaster Management Act 2010.
This led to a stalemate situation in the planning process of the authority in the wake of Covid-19.
The report also highlighted that the NDMA retained $4 million donated by China for the construction of 250 beds Isolation Hospital and Infections Treatment Centre (IHITC), Islamabad, but assigned the construction task to FWO by utilising the funds meant for fighting Covid-19.
The NDMA also failed to obtain the vouchers, etc., against the advances paid to FWO, and did not even make adjustments of Rs690 million paid in advance for construction of IHITC and renovation of Haj Complex, Rawalpindi, provision of quarantine facilities at Karachi and establishment of national control room.

Auditors point out irregularities in procurement during pandemic

The report added that after the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic, the authority initiated procurement process and started emergency procurements directly from China mainly related to biomedical equipment, testing kits and personal protective equipment (PPEs).
The total procurements from China up to 30 June, 2020 amounted to $62.27 million in three phases, and the NDMA approached potential vendors in China but there was no documentary evidence available in this regard, nor were the minutes of video-conferences between the technical committee of NDMA, the committee constituted by Pakistani Embassy Beijing and the vendors recorded.
The NDMA also failed to recover liquidated damages (LD) charges from the suppliers upon late delivery of items related to Covid-19 procurements in 123 cases amounting to Rs2.64 billion and $8.33 million in 11 other cases.
The irregularities highlighted in the audit report included loss to public exchequer on account of purchase of ventilators at higher rates amounting to $1.96 million, procurement of ventilators at higher rates without justification and misprocurement amounted to Rs69.73 million.
The audit report recommended that NDMA needed to strengthen the contract management processes and internal controls.
Defence services
The audit report also pointed out deficiencies worth around Rs3.87 billion and $7.26 million in the records of defence services and highlighted weak internal controls that could have led to expenditure over and above the actual allocation.
During Covid-19 pandemic, the central procurement of Pakistan Army was carried out by the Director General Procurements, Army. For the Pakistan Air force and Pakistan Navy it was done by the Director Procurement (Air) and Director Procurement (Navy) respectively.
Besides, the procurements were made by the Central Ordnances Depots (COD), Medical Directorate GHQ and hospitals under its control carried out local purchase of medicines and electro-medical equipments.
The accounts are maintained by the Controller of Military Accounts (Defence Purchase), Controller of Military Accounts - Peshawar Command (CMA -PC), Controller of Military Accounts -Rawalpindi Command (CMA- RC).
The most serious audit objection relates to non-reconciliation of allocation and expenditure amounting to over Rs1.89 billion.
The auditors have stated that the budget directorate GHQ allocated Rs4.86 billion to Pakistan Army to fight Covid-19, on June 30 last year.
However, the record of CMA (RC) showed Rs3.48 billion was allocated to counter Covid-19 measures, which resulted into difference of Rs1.38 billion in overall Covid-19 allocation.
Whereas on its part the CMA (RC) Rawalpindi released payments of Rs1.42 billion relating to Covid-19, but its own record shows that the overall Covid-19 expenditure was Rs911.77 million, which resulted into a difference of Rs511.66 million.
The other audit objections included irregular expenditure by AFIC Rawalpindi amounting to Rs200 mn by procurement of normal cardiac medicines out of allocation for Covid-19. 
Auditor General of Pakistan has recommended actions to improve the performance of the audited entities to realise the full benefit of the audit activity.

The theme of the competition was ‘Mountains in the Changing Climate’, which marked the opening of Pakistan Mountain Festival (PMF)at Fatima Jinnah Women University (FJWU) on Wednesday. The festival is an annual event organised by Development Communications Network (Devcom-Pakistan) to commemorate the United Nations International Mountains Day (IMD).

The participating institutions included Fatima Jinnah Women University, National College of the Arts (NCA), Rawalpindi Women University, Westminster Academy, Foundation University Islamabad campus, IMCG F-7/2, and National Textile Institute.
Participants painted real-life scenes from the northern parts of Pakistan depicting the impact of climate change. Effects of deforestation and degradation, and loss of biological diversity was also the content of the oil-on-canvas paintings that not only reflected the aesthetic sense of participants but also the level of their understanding of climatic challenges.
FJWU Head of Fine Arts Raheela Mushtaq said engaging art students in such a creative pursuit was imperative towards highlighting the impact of climate change. Awareness raising and education about causes and consequences of climate change is very important for society and such events support it.
Devcom-Pakistan’s director of PMF Munir Ahmed said impact of the paintings was more powerful than speeches and writings, adding that the International Mountain Day (Dec 11) was dedicated towards raising awareness about opportunities and challenges faced by people in mountainous regions.
He said we need to build alliances that will bring a positive change in the lives of people from the mountains, adding that mountains played a significant role in providing water and food to millions of people in the world.
“Mountains cover around 22 per cent of the earth’s surface and 13pc of the world’s population live in the mountains. About 90pc of the world’s mountain inhabitants live in developing countries, where a huge population live under the poverty line, and one out of every three individuals experiences the danger of food insecurity,” he said.

He was speaking at the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on National Health Services (NHS). 
The meeting was chaired by Balochistan Awami Party MNA Khalid Hussain Magsi and held in a committee room of the health ministry.

Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) President PMA Punjab Col ® Dr Ghulam Shabir while briefing Medical and Dental Colleges Admission Tests (MDCAT) alleged that the Pakistan Medical Council (PMC) had issued a tailor-made tender for the hiring of company to hold tests.
He said the association and other stakeholders had contacted SAPM Dr Faisal Sultan and also filed cases in courts to stop the test, which was held in September, but the government did not listen to it.
“Unfortunately matter was also delayed in the courts as they only hold hearings rather than issuing a stay order. Now MDCAT has become a controversial as PMC has cancelled the 10 years contract with the company and advertised for new bids. It is an attempt to avoid submission of agreement in the courts,” he said.
However Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz MNA Dr. Nisar Ahmed Cheema said that the committee had already recommended that the testing company should be blacklisted and new tests should be conducted by universities.
“We have summoned President and Vice President of PMC but they did not bother to attend meeting. Now we have been considering issuing privilege motion,” he said.

10,President Alvi signs journalists protection bill into act,"People do not want that their mistakes to be exposed so they put pressure on the journalists, says Alvi.","ISLAMABAD: President Dr Arif Alvi on Wednesday signed the Protection of Journalists and Media Professionals Bill into act, and termed it historic legislation for the country.
Dr Alvi said people did not want that their mistakes to be exposed so they put pressure on the journalists.
The bill focused on protecting lives of journalists, saving them from harassment and torture and ensuring their welfare by giving facilities of life and health insurance.
The President stressed the need for developing a culture of tolerance for journalists because they were only doing reporting and disseminating information.
Addressing the signing ceremony Federal Minister for Information Chaudhry Fawad Hussain said his ministry stood behind the working journalists, and added that a section in Pakistan tried to give the impression that the press was not free here.

“If there is no free press in Pakistan, then there will be no free press anywhere in the world,” he added, “When it comes to press freedom, we compare ourselves not with the Third World and the Muslim World but with the First World.”
Chaudhry Fawad Hussain said since there was no defamation law in Pakistan, so there was more freedom of the press than even in the first world.
The bill has been prepared by the Ministry of Human Rights and the minister Dr Shirin Mazari, in her remarks said the new law was progressive in nature and gave insurance of life and health to the journalists and media professionals.
Meanwhile, global media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has condemned the inclusion of “an extremely vague section” in a law on protecting journalists that was passed by the parliament earlier this month.
The RSF in a statement said that Section 6 of the law neutralises virtually all the protection that it was supposed to provide.
“This section prohibits all journalists and media professionals from spreading ‘false information’ and producing material that ‘advocates hatred’ or constitutes ‘incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence’ – without clearly defining what any of these terms means,” RSF said in the statement.

11,Supreme Court reluctant to disclose its employees’ details,PIC had in July allowed a plea filed by a citizen seeking information about sanctioned strength of SC staff from BS-1 to BS-22.,"ISLAMABAD: Reluctant to disclose details of employees, the Supreme Court of Pakistan has asked the Islamabad High Court (IHC) to overrule a decision of another judicial forum which has ordered complete disclosure of apex court’s entire workforce.
The Supreme Court Registrar Jawad Paul, through Additional Attorney General Amir Rehman filed a petition before the Islamabad High Court against the order of the Pakistan Information Commission (PIC).
PIC on July 12 allowed an application filed by a citizen Mukhtar Ahmed seeking information about sanctioned strength of SC staff from BS-1 to BS-22, vacant positions, daily wagers, posts created after January 1, 2017, persons with disabilities and transgender working in the apex court.
SC Registrar filed a review petition against the order of the PIC which has been dismissed on Nov 17.
Subsequently, the apex court’s registrar through the petition filed before the IHC requested that the information commission’s direction may be declared illegal.
According to the petition, which will be taken up by IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah on Thursday (today), “the impugned orders [of PIC] are without jurisdiction and in violation of express provisions of the constitution of and the statutory law on the subject.”
The petition pointed out that “the primary function of the PIC is to decide appeals filed under section 17 of the Right of Access to Information Act (RTI) against decision or lack thereof the designated public official of the public body.
The petition contended that “PIC erred in law while observing that Supreme Court is a public body and failed to comprehend the difference between the federal law as defined in Article 260 of the constitution” which means that laws made by or under the authority of the Parliament adding that Article 191 and 202 empower the Supreme Court and High Courts to frame rules regulating its practice and procedure.
The petition stated that “the direction issued by the PIC in exercise of power under section 20 (e) of the Act for the notification of designated officer under section 9 of the Act and to take measure for publication of information and record…applicable to public bodies and not to the constitutional court.”
The petition requested the court to declare the PIC’s order as illegal.
The applicant Mukhtar Ahmed initially sought information from the apex court.
Hence, the Registrar Office has not paid due attention to my application and hasn’t decided it on its own merits in the light of relevant provisions of law and the Constitution.
