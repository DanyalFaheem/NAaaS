The approval from the bank’s board of directors was conveyed by IDB President Dr Muhammad Sulaiman Al-Jasser to Minister for Economic Affairs Omar Ayub Khan at a meeting in Islamabad, the ministry said on Monday.   
A financing agreement of $72.5m for obtaining Covid-19 vaccines was signed by the Jeddah-based bank and the economics ministry. Dr Al-Jasser updated the minister that the bank has also approved $180m financing for Mohmand Dam Hydropower Project.  
Dr Al-Jasser is also the chairman of IDB’s board of directors and is currently in Islamabad on a four-day visit to attend 17th Extraordinary session of the Organisation of Islamic Conference’s Council of Foreign Ministers to discuss the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan.  
The two projects are aimed at supporting the country’s green agenda in the energy sector as well as the ongoing efforts to counter the adverse impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. Both sides also discussed the ongoing economic cooperation between Pakistan and IDB. 
Dr Al-Jasser said his bank was one of the leading development partners of Pakistan and would continue to mobilise more financial resources for developing infrastructure, uplifting the social sector and achieving sustainable economic growth. He assured that the IDB would continue to leverage private financing to support trade needs, including the import of petroleum products. 
Pakistan is the founding member of the IDB, an important multilateral development bank with 57 member countries. Pakistan is one of the top-three largest beneficiaries of the bank’s financing. Since its inception, the bank has approved $13.6 billion financing for the country, covering all the major sectors of the economy such as energy, industry, agriculture, transport, health and financial services. 
Minister for Economic Affairs Omar Ayub thanked the IDB president for visiting Islamabad and his continued support to Pakistan and welcomed the bank’s role to support member countries in Covid-19 response, recovery and the procurement of vaccine and saving lives and livelihood amid the pandemic. 
The minister also thanked Dr Al-Jasser for his resolve to support the financing needs of the country in future. He said Pakistan appreciated IDB’s support in green and clean energy development projects, including the Mohmand Dam Hydropower Project, which will not only generate 800 megawatts of electricity but also increase the country’s water storage capacity by 1,293m acre-feet.  
The project is also expected to create a food security buffer, provide 13.32 cubic metres per second of clean drinking water to Peshawar’s residents and create more than 6,000 direct jobs for the local people. 
Mohmand Dam is the world’s fifth-highest concrete-face rockfill dam — a type of dam widely used in hydropower projects. Construction work on the project started two years ago and is under way at 13 sites simultaneously, including diversion tunnels, power intake and power waterway, spillway, re-regulation pond, left bank irrigation tunnel, switchyard, powerhouse, main dam abutment, access roads, and project colony. 
As of now, Pakistan’s energy sector has received the largest share of IDB Group development interventions by absorbing 68.4 per cent (about $9.3bn) of the group’s investments. The $72.5m of funding to support is for Pakistan’s International Vaccine Access Centre Covid-19 project — also co-funded by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. 
The funding will contribute to the government’s efforts to vaccinate 70pc of the population eligible for vaccination aged 18 years and above, including health care and frontline workers and other priority groups. This comes in the framework of the second track of IDB Group’s $4.56bn Strategic Preparedness and Response Program, specifically designed to support member countries with their health and economic recovery programmes against the Covid-19 pandemic.

1,Banks disburse record Rs1.4tr agri loans in FY21,SBP sets Rs1.7tr target for the current fiscal year.,"LAHORE: State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Governor Dr Reza Baqir on Monday appreciated the banks for providing unprecedented Rs1.4 trillion agri loans during 2020-21.
Chairing the annual meeting of the Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) in Multan, Dr Baqir acknowledged the fact that despite Covid-19 pandemic challenges, collective efforts of 50 financial institutions under ACAC guidance helped to achieve 91pc of the assigned target.
He said that banks’ leadership could now take this journey to the next level of qualitative improvement in agriculture credit in line with the strategic shift and key policy actions taken by the SBP.

SBP sets Rs1.7tr target for the current fiscal year

Announcing the current year’s agriculture credit target of Rs1.7tr with 5 million borrowers, the governor marked the insistent need to address quality of credit, its geographical imbalances and uneven distribution amongst different categories of borrowers.
He announced two new measures to help boost agriculture financing, firstly, a comprehensive scoring model to rank banks according to key agriculture credit indicators and targets. To foster a competitive environment, the banks performing well will duly be recognised whereas underperforming banks will be strongly encouraged to focus on metrics where improvement is needed.
He said the second measure designates a bank volunteering to serve as a champion/lead bank in an underserved province/area. Further steps in this regard include establishing help desks in underserved areas to facilitate farmers, and launching targeted and collaborative awareness drives for an extensive outreach.
He said that the SBP’s vision will serve two-fold purposes; enhancing farmers’ financial inclusion while providing more lending opportunities to the banks.
Upon convening ACAC meeting in Multan, the governor especially highlighted the immense agricultural potential of the area and the opportunities in expanding agriculture finance.
This was followed by a presentation on the performance of banks in agricultural financing. The ACAC deliberated on the new directions in agricultural financing, particularly the climate-smart agriculture practices and the role that financial institutions can play.
Moreover, the committee also discussed avenues to enhance the efficiency of existing agriculture credit infrastructure across the country.
In the second session of ACAC, new and innovative ideas were presented by selected banks and other stakeholders in the area of value chain solutions, electronic warehouse receipt financing, digital loan origination system and horticulture value chain financing.
The ACAC approved the new ideas and set targets for scaling up pilot projects.
The ACAC meeting was attended by senior officials of federal and provincial governments, presidents/CEOs of banks, members of provincial chambers of agriculture, progressive farmers, representatives of regional farming communities and SBP senior officials.

4,Automobile financing stays flat in November,Year-on-year it jumps 42pc to Rs349bn.,"KARACHI: Bank  financing for automobiles jumped 42 per cent year-on-year to Rs349  billion in November. However, month-on-month, it grew by a paltry 1pc, data released by State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Monday showed.
“This  is the lowest monthly increase after July 2020 when it stood at  Rs215bn,” said Arsalan Hanif of Arif Habib Securities attributing the  slowdown to the amendments made by the SBP to prudential regulations  regarding auto financing announced in the last week of September. 
He  said the auto market has started feeling the pinch of SBP’s prudential  regulations aimed at compressing the demand for automobiles and reducing  import bill to support the balance of payments. However, he said the  real impact of the SBP decision would be more visible from January next  year onwards as currently, deliveries of cars are being made which have  been booked three to six months back.
He said the increase in interest rate to 9.75pc from 7pc in September had also made many buyers cautious. 

Year-on-year it jumps 42pc to Rs349bn

As  per data of the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association (PAMA), car  sales plunged to 15,351 units in November from 17,413 units in October  and 18,971 units in September. However, overall car sales in 5MFY22  jumped to 90,303 units from 55,779 units in the same period last year.
Total  sales of jeeps also fell to 1,016 units in November from 1,251 units in  October while total pickup sales slightly came down to 2,347 units from  2,360 units in October.
Mr Arsalan said the SBP’s prudential  regulation for consumer financing would not be applicable on locally  manufactured cars below 1,000cc and locally manufactured electric  vehicles because the government wanted to protect lower- to  middle-income category purchases along with promoting the use of clean  energy. 
Some of the key SBP’s decisions were cut in maximum  tenure of auto financing from seven years to five years, increase in  down payment for auto financing to 30pc from 15pc and reduction in  maximum tenure for a personal loan from five years to four years. 
Maximum  debt-burden ratio, allowed to a borrower had been decreased from 50pc to  40pc while the overall auto financing limits availed by one person from  all banks/DFIs, in aggregate, would not exceed Rs3m, at any point in  time. 
An authorised dealer of locally assembled cars said he had  talked to various banks where officials said that the processing of an application for auto financing has fallen by 40-50pc from October  onwards, while showrooms are also facing the same situation where buyers  arrive for booking of cars through bank auto financing. 
The  government is also planning to control rising import bill by increasing  duties on luxury items including completely built-up (CBU) cars followed  by higher federal excise duty on locally manufactured cars in the mini-budget. 
Umair Naseer of Topline Securities said the increase in  regulatory duty on CBUs would result in high car prices and may result  in reduced demand for imported CBUs by new entrants.

5,TRG Pakistan to park liquid assets in SPV,The share price of TRG Pakistan Ltd increases 7.5pc to Rs114.41 apiece.,"KARACHI: TRG Pakistan Ltd said on Monday it will let its portion of the liquid assets — to be received from its associate TRG International — be parked in a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to ensure “value, benefit and liquidity” for shareholders.
The TRG International-owned SPV will purchase from time to time the shares of TRG Pakistan from the stock market, it said in a regulatory filing.
TRG Pakistan holds 45 per cent shares of TRG International, which recently sold one of its businesses, E-Telequote. 
This has resulted in TRG Pakistan getting an inflow of dollars in proportion to its shareholding in TRG International.
The locally listed company told investors on Dec 10 that its US-based associate approved the allocation of liquid assets to shareholders that would result in an inflow of about $120 million. 
TRG Pakistan’s portion of the liquid assets includes $10m in deferred cash. In addition, the company will also receive 5.4m shares of its listed portfolio company, Ibex Ltd.
According to Arif Habib Ltd, TRG Pakistan could either directly receive a share in TRG International’s liquid assets (cash or a certain number of shares of Ibex Ltd) by means of full or partial redemption or continue with its investment in TRG International. 
Its board decided to go for the latter, which means continuing to “work towards further maximising value and capital returns of its proceeds for the company and its shareholders”.
The share price of TRG Pakistan Ltd increased 7.5pc to Rs114.41 apiece on Monday.
