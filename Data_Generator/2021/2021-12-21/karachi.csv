0,Investigators unclear about cause of Shershah drain blast,Samples being sent to KU and Lahore labs for forensics; authorities demolishing structures built on nullah.,"KARACHI: Investigators probing the Shershah drain blast have decided to send several pieces of evidence collected from the scene to two labs for a forensic examination to determine the exact cause of the explosion, it emerged on Monday.
On Dec 18, a blast believed to have caused by accumulation of gases in a sewerage line that destroyed a building housing a private bank and other office killing 17 people.
As investigators were not sure about a preliminary report submitted by the bomb disposal squad that exiting of gases from the drain running underneath the building caused the blast, they decided to widen the scope of investigation.
DIG-South Sharjeel Kharal on Monday chaired a meeting to review the progress so far made in the case.

Samples being sent to KU and Lahore labs for forensics; authorities demolishing structures built on nullah 

Talking to Dawn, the DIG said they decided to seek cooperation and help of other institutions as well for investigation purpose to ascertain the possible causes of the explosion and its deadliness.
He said they also held a meeting with the Punjab’s Forensic Science Agency’s experts and sought guidelines from them about collection of evidence and its proper packaging for sending to them.
He said that ‘main evidence’ would be sent to Lahore while some other pieces would be sent to a forensic lab of Karachi University to determine the cause of the explosion.
Doubts over SSGC version
Besides, it was also under investigation whether a gas line of the Sui Southern Gas Company passed through the area or not, the DIG said.
Initially, the SSGC had claimed that their gas line did not pass through the area, but one of the top investigators said that this might not be true as it had been noticed institutions concerned tended to absolve themselves from any responsibility in case of such tragedies.
The DIG said they would approach environmental experts to assess the possibility of the existence of gas in the atmosphere to determine as to why the blast was so deadly.
He said the investigators would expose any institution or the bank concerned if found negligent during the course of their probe.
Also on Monday, a team of investigators led by Keamari SSP (Investigation) Abdullah Memon visited the scene and told reporters that the police had not concluded yet that the leakage of gases in the sewerage line triggered the explosion.
He said it would also be determined as to how the building was constructed on a 14-foot-wide nullah (drain). He said the investigators had asked the district administration not to demolish the remaining portion of the building as they were still collecting evidence.
Removal of encroachments from drain begins
The district administration has also started removing encroachments from the drain after the tragedy.
Deputy Commissioner-Keamari Mukhtiar Abro told the media that Shershah drain would be cleared from encroachments up to the Lyari river.
He said encroachments on the other side of the drain were being removed and when police investigators allowed them, they would also destroy the remaining part of the ill-fated building.
SITE Managing Director Munawar Ali Mahesar told the media that the statement of the SSGC about the absence of a gas line was ‘misleading’.
He claimed that the allotment of the building that housed the private bank branch was cancelled earlier this month.
The DIG-South said total 13 employees were posted in the bank but on Saturday only half of the staffs were working. He said total 17 persons, including five employees of the bank, died in the explosion.

2,Ex-Orangi SHO sent to prison on judicial remand,IO informs court that pistol recovered from suspect has been sent to Forensic Science Laboratory for a ballistic analysis.,"KARACHI: An antiterrorism court on Monday remanded a former SHO of the Orangi Town police station in judicial custody in a case pertaining to unlawful use of a weapon that the police claimed to have recovered from a teenage student after killing him in an alleged fake encounter.
Inspector Azam Gopang was held for allegedly foisting a fake recovery of a pistol on victim Arsalan Mehsud.
On Dec 7, Constable Toheed, who was in plain clothes, along with his civilian friend Umair allegedly gunned down Arsalan Mehsud and wounded his friend Yasir near the Qatar Hospital in Orangi Town.
On Monday, the investigating officer produced the held policeman before the administrative judge of the ATCs on expiry of his physical remand and requested for an extension in the same.
The IO informed the court that a pistol recovered from the suspect had been sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory for a ballistic analysis. Other accomplices of the suspects, who were believed to be at large, were yet to be arrested while vehicles used in the offence were also needed to be recovered, he added.
Opposing the request for remand extension, Gopang’s counsel Abid Zaman requested the judge to remand his client in judicial custody since he was no more required to be probed by police.
After hearing arguments, the judge sent the suspect to prison on judicial remand.
Initially, the police claimed that the victim, who was returning from a tuition centre in Nazimabad, was a criminal. But after widespread condemnation on social media and protests by relatives and community members, it emerged that the encounter was fake. 
Later, the constable and his civilian friend were arrested and a case under Section 302 (premeditated murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code was registered against them.
Separately, another case was registered against Inspector Gopang under Section 24 of the Sindh Arms Act (punishment for possessing arms with intent to use for unlawful purposes) on behalf of the state.

4,Confusion prevails over winter vacation as Sindh rejects NCOC ‘suggestion’,Educational institutes will open from January 3.,"KARACHI: Monday was the day of big confusion as parents in the entire province mulled over whether to send their children to school or not. Still, most schools were very clear about winter vacations commencing from Dec 20 while others didn’t know what to do and whom to follow.
The problem was a suggestion from the National Command Operation Centre (NCOC) to push forward the vacations to Jan 3, 2022. But earlier, on Dec 9, a sub-committee of the steering committee of the Sindh education department had announced the winter vacation schedule as Dec 20 to Jan 1.
The NCOC wanted to delay vacations even further, for the second or third week of January, so that the ongoing vaccination campaign in educational institutions could be completed by then. 
But then on Friday (Dec 17), it was announced from there that all educational institutions will close for winter vacations from Jan 3. Some fake news also followed that said that the educational institutions in Sindh had been sent a fresh notification asking them to comply with the NCOC’s decision.

Educational institutes will open from Jan 3

Dawn was informed by the Chief Minister’s office that the NCOC had merely suggested for the holidays to commence from Jan 3, which Sindh rejected.
And to settle that the same schedule of Dec 20 to Jan 1 will be followed by both government and private schools in the province, the Registrar, Directorate for Inspection and Registration of Private Educational Institutions, Rafia Mallah, also said that the Sindh government’s old notification was still valid until a new notification was issued by the education minister. 
The chairman of the Private Schools Management Association, Danish-uz-Zaman, also said that all private schools break for winter for 10 days from Monday. 
That said, it was observed that several so-called elitist private schools remained open on Monday. 
The head of another schools’ body, All Private Schools Management Association Sindh, Syed Tariq Shah, said that the schools that remained open on Monday are not all elitist schools with different views and different schedules. “They must have some examinations going on which they need to quickly wind up to break for winter. So most of them are semi-closed, meaning they are only calling in those students who have exams. The rest are off,” he explained.
He also explained that the confusion over the holidays over the last few days has probably the reason for them not to have already held their exams.   
“There were too much confusion. Our schools were also confused and the phone calls they were getting from parents, giving them news bulletins, which they thought were correct, was making the situation even worse. Then it was cleared that all schools are not following NCOC but the earlier directives about the holidays issued by the steering committee,” he added.

5,"Retailers sell vegetables, fruits at twice the wholesale price in Karachi",Wholesalers say at least three to four more vegetable markets must be set up in city.,"KARACHI: Retailers in Karachi have been charging almost double the wholesale price of vegetables while there is no limit of making profit on fruits. 
This practice has been in vogue since the shifting of Sabzi Mandi to Superhighway from University Road in 2001.
Traders pointed out a number of reasons for non-availability of vegetables and fruits at reasonable rates in the city. One of the main reasons was the absence of any producing areas of vegetables and fruits in Karachi. 
Green peas of Malir is perhaps the only seasonal crop for which people wait and ignore Punjab’s and Swat peas. Malir pea excels with up-country products because of its sweet taste. 
Trading in green vegetables usually gets under way at midnight while auction of dry vegetables like onion and potato kicks off from Fajr prayers. 
Only retailers who throng the market in large numbers take part in vegetable auctions which go on till Fajr, while fruit auction takes place early in the morning. 

Wholesalers say at least three to four more vegetable markets must be set up in city

Sub-wholesalers situated inside the Mandi also participate in vegetable auctions and main buyers are the general public while some pushcart owners and retailers of fruits and vegetables also lift the quantities. 
The wholesalers inside the Mandi charge Rs20 per kg for the new variety of onion from Sindh while consumers lift it at Rs40 per kg. 
New Punjab potato is available at Rs30-35 per kg but consumers are paying Rs40-50 per kg in various markets.

Transportation cost
“Wholesalers operate at a very low profit than retailers,” wholesaler Shahabuddin said, adding that consumers can get vegetables at low rates if transportation cost comes down. 
President of Falahai Anjuman Wholesale Market Shahjehan said the auction rate of vegetables is Rs5 per kg lower than the price being charged by the wholesalers in the Mandi. 
He said one of the main cost push factors was transportation cost. A truck from Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan cost over Rs50,000 against Rs35,000-40,000 two years ago. 
Shahjehan said there must be some limit of profit making. 
Traders cannot violate the profit limit like retailers as they directly procure vegetables from the growers and can charge up to 20 per cent profit — 10pc wastage and 10pc profit, he said. 
He said the vegetable market receives 500-600 people daily mostly from nearby areas, while on the weekend the number did not exceed 2,000 people. 
“The city must have at least three to four more Sabzi Mandis. A wholesale Mandi is being constructed at Ghagar Pathak,” he said, adding that fruit/vegetable plazas should be constructed in various areas. 
President of Karachi Wholesale Fruits Merchants and Commission Agents Association Mohammad Zahid Awan said the daily arrival of household customers in the Mandi is negligible, while on Saturdays and Sundays, the number ranged between 600-700 persons. 
He said transporters charged Rs50,000-60,000 for bringing 500-600 wooden boxes of fruits from the up-country against Rs32,000-35,000 one and a half years ago. 
He said the auction price of fruits is cheaper by Rs50-150 per carton as compared to sub-wholesale rate at the Mandi. 
Afzal Khan of the Karachi Wholesale Fruits Merchants and Commission Agents Association said good quality Qandhari pomegranate (two-layer variety) was available at Rs333 per kg or Rs4,000 per 12kg it was sold between Rs450-500 per kg in retail. 
The three-layer Qandhari pomegranate costs Rs200 per kg or Rs2,500-2,600 per 13kg in the Mandi and it is priced at Rs350-400 per kg in retail market. 
Good quality guava is available at Rs80-90 per kg but it is sold at Rs200-300 per kg in retail market. 
Wholesale price of orange (Mosambi) from Punjab is Rs100 per dozen but the retailers sell it at Rs300. 
Sindh’s banana is selling at Rs50-80 per dozen but retailers are charging Rs80-150 per dozen. 
The Commissioner of Karachi has been issuing price lists of various items but for the last over one week, his office’s website does not open carrying the message “the service is unavailable”. 
The local government has stopped issuing price lists for the last two years.

Or so it appeared on Sunday when it held for the first time in its 16-year history an open house. 
With the new chief executive Junaid Zuberi in the saddle, and most of its faculty intact, the academy cut a different picture on Sunday. As is known, an open house is meant for all, most of all for the ‘general public’. There were a variety of short duration items taking place — theatre and musical bits, poetry recitation, dastangoi, etc — one after another at spots on the premises which were given interesting names such as Bagheecha, Mehrab and Shajar-i-Dastan. 
There were also food stalls, apart from the regular canteen that the academy has for its faculty and students — after all it was a six-hour non-stop programme.

It is difficult to mention all of the pieces in a single report, but there are some which need mention either for the passion with which they were put together or diligence that had gone into their execution. For example, Robin John’s Nuvole Bianche on the piano was a soothing rendition of the Italian composition. In terms of diligence, it was Yogeshwar and his team’s ‘Storyteller’s Stall’ that looked and sounded the most promising, an act into which a great deal of hard work had gone. With the help of individual characters, tales were told with mythological references. 
Apart from that, Fatima Ijaz’s recitation of English poems from her book The Shade of Longing published by The Little Book Company, beginning with Brutal Caress of a Memory, was very well received. 
While there was a considerable buzz around the performances, and make no mistake that the effort was worthy enough to experience, one felt that there was too much happening with too little time to process it. There were certain extremely serious acts such as ‘Isolation’ which needed a bit of time to absorb, but as soon as it finished the viewers were quickly taken to another not-so-serious item that diluted its effect. Still, given that Napa has opened its doors after a long time and the psychologically stifling situation arising out of the pandemic, the event indicated that things have resumed moving in the right, normal direction.

Talking to a delegation of the probationary officers of 48th specialised training programme (STP) of the Pakistan Audit & Accounts Service at the Governor House, Mr Ismail said the Pakistan Peoples Party-led government could not start significant programmes like Sehat Sahulat Card and Ration Card for people.
Boasting about the projects initiated by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government, including Kamyab Jawan Programme, Ehsas Programme, Sehat Sahulat Card and Ration Card facility, he said the schemes had been initiated to improve life of the common man.
He also highlighted the significance of the Karachi Transformation Plan (KTP) under which Green Line BRT project and procurement of 52 fire tenders for the city have been completed.
Stressing the need for devolution of power at the local level, he said it provided greater freedom and flexibility to work and local bodies could work more effectively to improve public services for their areas.
He asked the officers to develop true professionalism and their skills through training so that they could contribute more effectively to governance and the public sector financial management.
“Civil servants need new attitudes of citizen-focused service delivery and management techniques to create more service-oriented bureaucratic practices,” he said.
“Strengthening technical competency of public administration through modernisation and technological advancement is necessary for improving the quality of service delivery and turning the public sector into a growth-oriented entity,” he added.
The governor observed that the PTI-led government had reduced non-productive expenditures, raised revenues, announced energy policy, resolved circular debt issue, rationalised subsidies and introduced incentives for the private sector which helped in stabilising the macroeconomic environment of the country.
He claimed that foreign exchange reserves were growing, stock market was witnessing robust activities and economic engagement of the private sector in the development process was growing because of the steps taken by the federal government.

9,Arguments sought on maintainability of petition about PIA plane crash,KARACHI: The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Monday directed a lawyer to satisfy the court about the maintainability of ...,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Monday directed a lawyer to satisfy the court about the maintainability of his petition filed against the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and others in connection with the Karachi plane.
The SHC also directed the counsel for PIA and CAA as well as an assistant attorney general to come prepared on the issue on the next date.
When a two-judge bench headed by Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha took up the petition for hearing, the lawyer of the petitioner requested the court to adjourn the hearing as he was unwell.
The bench directed him to satisfy as to how the petition was maintainable as per the last order and asked its office to fix the matter for hearing after winter vacations.
In its last order, the SHC observed that the petition was moved under Article 199 of the Constitution about the crash of PK-8303 in Model Colony in May 2020 in which 97 of the 99 passengers and crew members on board died.
It had directed the lawyer to address the court as to how this petition was maintainable under the constitutional jurisdiction of the court as prima facie it was a public interest litigation keeping in view that the high court had no suo motu jurisdiction.
“The petitioner shall also satisfy this court regarding the locus standi of the petitioner whether it is an aggrieved party for the purpose of Article 199 of the Constitution,” it added.
The Public Interest Law Association of Pakistan moved the SHC about the crash of PK-8303, a PIA domestic flight originated in Lahore on May 22, 2020 which made an unsuccessful landing attempt at Karachi airport on its engines without lowering the landing gear and crashed into houses in nearby Model Colony later.
The petitioner pleaded to declare that the aviation division, PIA and CAA had failed to act diligently in accordance with the relevant laws to provide safe and efficient air transport services and constitute a judicial commission to determine the alleged mismanagement of PIA and its failure to operate and maintain commercial fight services as mandated under the law.
The petitioner also sought directives for respondents to produce the final investigation reports before the court of all accidents involving PIA, including the PK-8303, and further asked the court to direct secretary of the aviation division to inform it about the status of Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority Bill, 2016 and issue further directive towards its expeditious enactment by the National Assembly.

11,"Week-long protests over death of policemen, suspect in ‘encounter’ turn violent","Police accused of killing the colleagues to make it look like an encounter, say heirs","LARKANA: A week-long protest over the Dec 13 incident, in which two policemen and a suspect were killed in an alleged encounter, turned violent on Monday when relatives of the deceased persons clashed with police on VIP Road in the city. 
The alleged encounter had taken place, according to the Larkana DIG, in Wada Mahar village on the outskirts of the city when the martyred policemen, ASI Muzaffar Khoso and constable Nawab Jatoi, intervened to stop two muggers from snatching a motorcycle from its rider. SSP Imran Qureshi, after the incident, had quoted SHO of the Akil police station Talib Junejo as identifying the suspects as Qadeer Mahar and Raju Mahar. According to the SHO, the encounter left the ASI and constable, as well as suspect Raju Mahar, dead. The other suspect, Qadeer Mahar, was wounded but managed to escape, he said.  
Since after the incident, relatives of the deceased policemen have been holding protest demonstration over failure of the area police to arrest the “actual killers” alleging that the ASI and constable were killed by their colleagues and a fake encounter report was registered at the Akil police station.  

Police accused of killing the colleagues to make it look like an encounter, say heirs

After failing to get their grievances heard at the higher level of police department, they on Monday along with other residents of the village marched up to the SSP Chowk to hold a noisy demonstration.  
Bashir Khoso, Haji Murad Jatoi and other relatives of the deceased policemen said although they laid down their lives in the line of duty, facts must come to light through a fair inquiry into what had actually happened that day. “We are looking for justice,” they said while other protesters continued to raise slogans against police. They pointed out that only three days back, the SHO had assured them [the heirs] that culprits would be arrested but no one had been touched till date. “The DIG and SSP are also keeping us on false hopes,” they added. 
Separately, relatives of the deceased suspect, Raju Mahar, also held a demonstration on VIP Road to demand an investigation into his death.  
Led by Ishaq Mahar, Yameen Mahar, Gulab Mahar and others, they accused the Akil police of killing Mahar in the fake encounter. They placed burning tyres and junk to block the road and disrupt vehicular traffic.  
The Akil police tried to persuade them to disperse peacefully, but in vain. In order to clear the road, the police applied baton charge causing chaos and a clash.  
The protesters then converged on the Sukarno Memorial Tower and blocked roads with tractor-driven trolleys. SHOs of six police stations along with a strong contingent used force to disperse them. The tractors, trolleys and a number of motorcycles of the protesters were impounded and taken to various police stations.  
The deceased suspect’s heirs claimed that the Akil police killed Raju Mahar and then ASI Khoso and constable Jatoi to give it a colour of encounter.  
“We were holding our protest peacefully by police unnecessarily used force against us,” they said. They also claimed that a number of protesters were rounded up during the police action. 
They demanded release of all protesters and vehicles. “We will continue the protest till the suspended SHO, Talib Hussain Junejo, is booked for the murder of Raju Mahar,” they said.  
It is pertinent to mention here that the bodies of the two policemen had remained unattended for about five hours after the incident while police could not find the body of suspect Raju Mahar at the crime scene when they were collecting the bodies of their two colleagues. The wounded suspect has also remained unaccounted for. 
Police had carried out an extensive search in the village and nearby areas but without any progress.    
A post-mortem examination of the policemen’s bodies was performed at the Chandka Medical College Hospital.  
A statement issued from the SSP’s office hours after the “encounter” had claimed that the killed suspect [Raju Mahar] was wanted by police in 12 cases of heinous nature registered against him at the Market, Akil, Mahota, Dari, Waleed and Jam Datar police stations of Larkana and Shaheed Benazirabad districts.  
Larkana DIG Mazhar Nawaz Shaikh had, on Dec 14, suspended three SHOs and ordered an inquiry into the “encounter”. The SHOs, Talib Hussain Junejo, Mohammad Urs Noonari and Ali Hassan Mugheri, were shifted to police lines. A four-member fact-finding team was also constituted.

The university’s vice chancellor Prof Dr Mohammad Siddique Kalhoro inaugurated the exhibition, displaying works of Abdul Majeed Mangi and Shakeel Ahmed Khaskheli at Benazir Gallery at the institute.
The VC, deans of various faculties, teachers, officers and students took keen interest in works of art and praised canvas and images created by the artists, who had showcased various cultural and historical places and nature, including palm trees, dates, different parts of Kotdiji Fort, bridges of Khairpur Mir’s, mountains, huts of Tharparkar, mud-thatched houses, shops, walls and other objects of interest. 
After witnessing the exhibition, the vice-chancellor participated in a ceremony held at the art gallery organised by the institute’s director Prof Saeed Ahmed Mangi and his team.
The pencil artist Khaskheli played on flute and received standing ovation from visitors, who had thronged the institute to see the exhibition. They were visibly mesmerised by the artist’s fascinating play on the instrument.
Artist Zulfiqar Ali Khan Qureshi made the audience sway by singing one of his famous songs Yar jaldi milo (Darling! see me soon). His performance captivated teachers and students alike and they could not help giving him a big hand.
The VC Dr Kalhoro said that works of Mangi and Khaskheli were indeed excellent and professional. While seeing their creative work he felt as though he was touring countryside in reality, he said. 
He said that urban students must have been astonished after looking at artwork of the eminent artists of Sindh. “How beautiful and charming landscapes are there in rural parts of Sindh,” he remarked.

The Jhuddo DSP was also present at the meeting.
According to sources, the SSP assured the delegation that the issue would be looked into and resolved soon.
The 12 MQM-P activists were reportedly booked after they tried to intervene in the alleged illegal detention of a woman, Parveen Kaimkhani, at the police station when she approached the SHO for the release of her son, Zainul Abedin. The youth was lodged in the lock-up and she had produced the ownership document of a motorcycle seized from him. 
The MQM-P delegation told the SSP that the SHO implicated the party activists in a false case instead of releasing the woman and her son.
