0,Pro-Beijing candidates sweep Hong Kong elections,"Leader says she is satisfied with election despite a 30.2pc voter turnout, the lowest since  1997.","HONG KONG: Candidates loyal to China’s Communist Party won a landslide victory in Hong Kong’s legislative elections after pro-democracy activists were imprisoned and authorities received the power to exclude those deemed inappropriate for office.
Candidates loyal to Beijing won a majority of the seats in Sunday’s election after the laws were changed to ensure that only pro-Beijing patriots could run the city.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said during a news conference she was satisfied with the election despite a 30.2pc voter turnout the lowest since the British handed Hong Kong over to China in 1997.
She said that the number of registered voters reached 92.5pc, a record high compared to the 2012 and 2016 elections, when around 70pc of voters had registered.
For registered voters, deciding whether they want to exercise their voting rights in a particular election is entirely a matter for themselves, she said.
In this election, 1.35 million voters cast their votes. They did not just return candidates of their choice to LegCo, and I think it was also because of their support for the improved electoral system, said Lam, referring to the city’s Legislative Council.
Under the new laws, the number of directly elected lawmakers was reduced from 35 to 20, even as the legislature was expanded from 70 to 90 seats. Most of the lawmakers were appointed by largely pro-Beijing bodies, ensuring that they make up the majority of the legislature.
All candidates were also vetted by a largely pro-Beijing committee before they could be nominated.
Lam said that even if there was a high turnout based on poor politics, such as the political polarization during the period of political strife in 2019, that is not something we should be glad to have.
Starry Lee, an elected pro-Beijing legislative council candidate from the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong party, said the 30pc turnout was within general public expectation. As I have mentioned before, this is a new system, this is a system that we call patriots administrating Hong Kong,” Lee said.
“This is a different one from the previous one, therefore you cannot compare directly. And I believe that with the new system, people need time to get used to that.
The opposition camp has criticised the elections, with the largest pro-democracy party, the Democratic Party, fielding no candidates for the first time since the 1997 handover.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said there were multiple reasons for the decline in voter turnout. It is not only the impact of the pandemic, but also the disruption and sabotage of anti-China elements in Hong Kong and external forces, Zhao said at a daily briefing.
Some overseas pro-democracy activists, including London-based Nathan Law, urged a boycott of the vote, saying the elections were undemocratic. Under the new election laws, incitement to boycott the voting or to cast invalid votes could be punished by up to three years in jail and a 200,000 Hong Kong dollar ($26,500) fine.
In a joint statement released by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the foreign ministers of Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and the United States expressed grave concern over the erosion of democratic elements of Hong Kong’s electoral system and growing restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly.

1,Philippines typhoon death toll hits 375,Police say 56 people are missing and 500 others are injured.,"SURIGAO CITY: The death toll from the strongest typhoon to hit the Philippines this year surged to 375 on Monday, as desperate survivors pleaded for urgent supplies of drinking water and food.
The Philippine Red Cross reported “complete carnage” in coastal areas after Super Typhoon Rai left homes, hospitals and schools “ripped to shreds”.
The storm tore off roofs, uprooted trees, toppled concrete power poles, smashed wooden houses to pieces, wiped out crops and flooded villages — sparking comparisons to the damage caused by Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013.
“Our situation is so desperate,” said Ferry Asuncion, a street vendor in the hard-hit seaside city of Surigao, which was devastated by the storm.
Residents urgently needed “drinking water and food”, he said.
At least 375 people were killed and 56 are missing in the latest disaster to hit the archipelago, with 500 more injured, the national police said.
More than 380,000 people fled their homes and beachfront resorts as Rai slammed into the country on Thursday.
One of the hardest-hit islands was Bohol -- known for its beaches, “Chocolate Hills” and tiny tarsier primates — where at least 94 people have died, provincial Governor Arthur Yap said on Facebook.
Many wooden houses in Bohol’s coastal town of Ubay were flattened and small fishing boats destroyed on the island, where a state of calamity has been declared.
A senior official at the national disaster agency said he had not expected as many deaths.
“I was proven wrong as it appears now coming from the reports,” said Casiano Monilla, deputy administrator for operations.
Typhoon season
Rai hit the Philippines late in the typhoon season: most cyclones develop between July and October.
Scientists have long warned that typhoons are becoming more powerful and strengthening more rapidly as the world becomes warmer because of human-driven climate change.

2,"MH17 suspects ‘served military interests’, say Dutch prosecutors",THE HAGUE: Dutch prosecutors said on Monday that four suspects accused of downing a Malaysia Airlines flight with a...,"THE HAGUE: Dutch prosecutors said on Monday that four suspects accused of downing a Malaysia Airlines flight with a surface-to-air missile were seeking to serve  “their own military interests”, as they launched closing arguments in the closely-watched trial.
Four suspects are being tried in absentia for launching a BUK missile that hit flight MH17 over war-torn eastern Ukraine in 2014, killing all 298 people on board.
Prosecutors launched closing arguments in the trial, saying the four suspects played pivotal roles in securing the BUK system, which was most likely intended to strike a Ukrainian war plane.
“If this was the intention, that doesn’t change the accusation of making it a criminal act,” public prosecutor Thijs Berger told the judges.
“A mistake in target also makes no difference to the evidence that such a crime has been committed.” The suspects  “used a BUK missile as a tool to serve their own military interest and hit MH17 with it”, he added.
International investigators say the BUK missile was originally brought from a Russian military base, ostensibly to be used in the fight against Ukrainian forces.
Berger said the men on trial  “did not press the button themselves, but...used it for their armed struggle with the aim of destroying an aircraft”. The four suspects on trial are Russian nationals Igor Girkin, Sergei Dubinsky and Oleg Pulatov, and Ukrainian citizen Leonid Kharchenko. All four have refused to appear in court in the Netherlands and are being tried in absentia.
In three days of hearings this week, the prosecution are formally charging the four suspects and will set out their sentencing demands.
A verdict at the high-security court, near Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport where MH17 took off on its doomed flight to Kuala Lumpur, is not expected until late 2022 at the earliest. “The maximum penalty is life imprisonment,” a court spokesperson said.
The hearings come as fresh tensions soar over Ukraine, with the West accusing Moscow of planning an invasion.
Girkin, 49, also known by his pseudonym  “Strelkov”, is the most high-profile suspect — a former Russian spy and historical re-enactment fan who helped kickstart the war in Ukraine.
Dubinsky, 57, who has also been linked with Russian intelligence, allegedly served as the separatists’ military intelligence chief.
Pulatov, 53, was an ex-Russian special forces soldier and one of Dubinsky’s deputies.
Kharchenko, 48, allegedly led a separatist unit in eastern Ukraine. Pulatov is the only suspect to be represented by lawyers.
Prosecutors will spend Monday and Tuesday explaining evidence including telephone and electronic eavesdropping, the circumstances surrounding the missile, and the defendants themselves.
The sentencing demand is expected to follow on Wednesday and will include an  “extensive justification of the requested penalty”, the spokesperson said.
Prosecutors said during the opening of the trial in March 2020 that if the court passed a sentence  “we will do everything in our power to ensure that it is enforced, whether in the Netherlands or elsewhere”.
The trial heard harrowing testimony from relatives earlier this year, who spoke of the heartbreak of the loss of children, parents and siblings, and called on  “corrupt” Russia to provide justice.
Kiev has been battling a pro-Moscow insurgency in two breakaway regions bordering Russia since 2014, when the Kremlin annexed Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula.
Western nations imposed tough sanctions on Russia amid international outrage over the shooting down of flight MH17.
Russia has recently massed troops near Ukraine’s borders and the West has for weeks accused it of planning an invasion, warning Moscow of massive sanctions should it launch an attack.

3,"Casualties in Afghanistan, Iraq much higher than US admitted: NYT","Documents show “flawed intelligence, faulty targeting, years of civilian deaths — and scant accountability”, states report.","WASHINGTON: Data collected after years of litigation and months of investigation persuaded The New York Times to conclude that civilian casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan were much higher than the United States ever acknowledged.  
Summing up its efforts to probe the US wars in the greater Middle East region, the newspaper wrote: “The promise was a war waged by all-seeing drones and precision bombs.” But the documents NYT obtained showed “flawed intelligence, faulty targeting, years of civilian deaths — and scant accountability”.  
The newspaper got access to the Pentagon documents about the war through Freedom of Information requests beginning in March 2017 and lawsuits filed against the US Defence Department and the Central Command.  
NYT reporters also visited more than 100 casualty sites and interviewed scores of surviving residents and current and former American officials. The findings, published this week in a two-part report, revealed that the US air war was “deeply flawed” and the number of civilian deaths had been “drastically undercounted”, by at least several hundreds, NYT reported.  
The document contradicted the Pentagon’s claim that the drone technology made it possible to destroy a part of a house filled with enemy fighters while leaving the rest of the structure standing. The NYT report revealed that over a five-year period, US forces executed more than 50,000 airstrikes in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, with much less than the advertised precision.  
Noting that before launching airstrikes the military must navigate elaborate protocols to estimate and minimise civilian deaths, the report acknowledged that often available intelligence “can mislead, fall short, or at times lead to disastrous errors”.  
The newspaper pointed out that sometimes videos shot from the air did not show people in buildings, under foliage or under tarpaulins or aluminum covers. Besides, “available data can be misinterpreted, as when people running to a fresh bombing site are assumed to be militants, not would-be rescuers”, the report added.  
“Sometimes men on motorcycles moving ‘in formation’, displaying the ‘signature’ of an imminent attack, were just men on motorcycles,” the report observed.  
NYT cited three specific reports to prove this point. One such case was a July 19, 2016 bombing by US special forces of three presumed Islamic State militant group’s staging areas in northern Syria. Initial reports were of 85 fighters killed. Instead, the dead were 120 farmers and other villagers.  
Another example was a November 2015 attack in Ramadi, Iraq, caused by a man seen dragging “an unknown heavy object” into an Islamic State position. The “object”, a review found, was a child, who died in the strike.

4,"UN chief lays wreath at Beirut port, pushes for blast accountability","“I know the will of the people to know the truth, the will of the people to have proper accountability,” he says.","BEIRUT: UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Monday said Lebanon needed proper accountability for the August 2020 Beirut port explosion and that elections due to be held next year could usher in political stability in the troubled country.
His comments followed a meeting with Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berri and a visit to the port, where he laid a wreath at a memorial for the more than 215 people killed when chemicals stored at the port for nearly seven years exploded.
“I know the will of the people to know the truth, the will of the people to have proper accountability,” Guterres said on the second day of a visit aimed at rallying international support for Lebanon.
The blast 16 months ago was a strong blow to a country already crushed by an economic meltdown described by the World Bank as one of the world’s worst since 1850.
Many Lebanese are looking to elections scheduled for the spring of next year to challenge the political establishment they hold responsible for the crisis and the blast.
Guterres said he had received a  “guarantee” from Lebanese leaders that the elections would be held and said they could create  “new political stability for the future.”  Guterres, who arrived on Sunday, has also called on Lebanon’s politicians to work to address an economic crisis that has left four in five Lebanese poor. “Lebanese political leaders do not have the right to be divided and paralyse the country,” he said.
Prime Minister Najib Mikati’s government has not met for more than two months amid a push by parties close to powerful politicians charged in connection with the blast to remove the judge leading the investigation.
The blast has been widely blamed on the corruption and dysfunction normalized by a political elite that has been in power since the end of the 1975-1990 civil war.

5,Chile celebrates as leftist Boric elected president,SANTIAGO: The streets of Santiago erupted in celebration on Sunday after leftist millennial Gabriel Boric became...,"SANTIAGO: The streets of Santiago erupted in celebration on Sunday after leftist millennial Gabriel Boric became Chile’s youngest-ever president-elect with an unexpectedly large victory over his far-right rival in a polarising race.
Boric, 35, garnered nearly 56 percent of the vote compared to 44 percent for ultra-conservative Jose Antonio Kast, who conceded even before the final result was known.
Tens of thousands of Chileans took to the streets of the capital and other cities after Kast’s concession, honking car horns in approval, brandishing pro-Boric placards, waving the rainbow LGBTQ flag and shouting:  “Viva Chile!” Fireworks lit the skies for hours on end.
“I’m thrilled, I am crying with joy. We dealt a blow to fascism!” pharmacy worker Jennie Enriquez, 45, said.
“I am happy because there are going to be many changes that will help the people and the working class,” added construction worker Luis Astorga, 58.
Boric had campaigned on the promise of installing a  “social welfare” state, increasing taxes and social spending in a country with one of the world’s largest gaps between rich and poor.
Branded a  “communist” by his detractors, he vowed in his first official address to  “expand social rights” in Chile, but to do so with  “fiscal responsibility.”  “We will do it protecting our macro-economy, we will do it well... to improve pensions and healthcare,” he said.
Kast congratulated Boric, who leads an alliance that includes Chile’s Communist Party,  “on his great triumph.”  “From today on, he is the president-elect of Chile and he deserves all our respect and constructive cooperation. Chile always comes first.” Kast is an apologist for brutal dictator Augusto Pinochet and his neo-liberal economic model, credited with Chile’s relative wealth but blamed for its deep-rooted social inequality.
He opposes same-sex marriage, contraception and abortion, and had initially pledged to close the ministry of women’s affairs, a promise he later rowed back on.
According to a projection by Chile’s Servel election body, turnout was more than 55 percent — a record since voting became voluntary in 2012.

6,Japanese space tourists return to Earth after 12 days on ISS,The returned crew will spend two to three weeks reconditioning under the guidance of doctors as they reacclimate to Earth.,"ALMATY: A Japanese billionaire returned to Earth on Monday, after 12 days on the International Space Station where he made videos about performing mundane tasks including brushing teeth and going to the bathroom. 
Online fashion tycoon Yusaku Maezawa and his assistant Yozo Hirano parachuted onto Kazakhstan’s steppe at around the expected landing time of 0313 GMT on Monday, along with Russian cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin. 
Footage from the landing site, around 150 kilometres southeast of the central Kazakhstan town of Zhezkazgan, showed the trio smiling after being helped out of the Soyuz descent module and into evacuation vehicles in freezing, foggy conditions. 
“The crew is feeling good,” Russia’s space agency Roscosmos said. 
In his first tweet since returning to Earth, Maezawa posted a picture of himself eating instant noodles, saying he was on “Earth now”. 
The returned crew will spend two to three weeks reconditioning under the guidance of doctors as they reacclimate to Earth. They are due to hold a post-mission press conference on Wednesday. 
Their journey marked Russia’s return to space tourism after a decade-long pause that saw competition emerge from the United States. 
They spent 12 days on the orbiting laboratory where the tourists documented their daily life aboard the ISS for Maezawa’s popular YouTube channel.

7,Russia expels two German diplomats in tit-for-tat move,Berlin says Russia’s decision  “further strains ties” between the two countries.,"MOSCOW: Russia on Monday expelled two German diplomats in response to a spat with Berlin over a German court’s ruling that Moscow had ordered the 2019 assassination of an ex-Chechen commander in a Berlin park.
“The German ambassador was informed that two diplomatic employees of the German embassy in Russia were declared ‘persona non grata’ as a symmetrical response,” Russia’s foreign ministry said in a statement. It did not say when the German diplomats needed to leave Russia.
The ministry added that it had registered a  “strong protest” with the German envoy over Berlin’s expulsion last week of two Russian diplomats last week.
Judges in Berlin sentenced Russian national Vadim Krasikov, alias Vadim Sokolov, to life in prison last week after convicting him of gunning down Georgian national Tornike Kavt­arashvili, 40, in a Berlin park in 2019.
The murder was meant  “as retaliation” for being a Kremlin opponent, a judge said.
Russia’s foreign ministry said that Moscow  “categorically denies the unfounded and divorced from reality accusations” that it was involved.
Following the announcement from Moscow, Berlin said that Russia’s decision  “further strains ties” between the two countries.
“This step is not surprising but is in the view of the German government completely unjustified,” a German foreign ministry spokesman said.
Germany had already thrown out two Russian diplomats shortly after the murder in protest at Moscow’s perceived lack of cooperation with the probe.
Russia denied any connection to the killing and responded with a tit-for-tat move.
