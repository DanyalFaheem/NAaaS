1,"Cricketer, friend booked on charge of raping girl",ISLAMABAD: A renowned international test cricketer and his friend have been booked by the capital police under...,"ISLAMABAD: A renowned international test cricketer and his friend have been booked by the capital police under different charges, including rape, police said.
The case was registered in the Shalimar police station under section 376, 292-b and 292-c of Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) in response to a complaint lodged by a resident of F-10.
According to the FIR, the complainant acquainted with the cricketer Yasir Shah long ago and on his invitation she along with her 14-year-old niece visited Lahore on June 1, 2021. Her niece was a student of class 10th, it added.
After two to three months, the complainant found her niece disturbed, the FIR said, adding on inquiry the girl told her aunt that at the residence of the player his (cricketer’s) friend obtained her mobile phone number and later they both started talking to the girl on WhatsApp.
On August 14, the cricketer’s friend took her to a flat at F-11 when she was returning from tuition and sexually assaulted her at gunpoint. He also made a video and threatened the girl not to tell anyone about it otherwise he would make the clip viral on social media.
The complainant said Yasir Shah also threatened her that he would get her implicated in any case. The girl told her aunt that the cricketer’s friend later took her to a flat at E-11 and again raped her.
When the complainant talked to Yasir Shah in September, he made fun of it and asked her to get the girl married with his friend. The complaint said her life and that of her niece was in danger and sought action against the suspects. When contacted, Station House Officer (SHO) Tipu Sultan told Dawn that the police had initiated an investigation after registering the case.
Apparently, the cricketer’s friend is the main suspect but investigation is in progress to determine the role of the two nominated in the FIR, he added.

2,‘Capital’s leopard family vulnerable to extinction from deliberate poisoning’,There have been reports of locals throwing meat laced with poison in the forest to get rid of the leopards.,"ISLAMABAD: The growing leopard population in the Margalla Hills terrain is reportedly vulnerable to extinction not because of poachers or natural causes but by deliberate poisoning.
The carnivorous animal, for its rising food requirements is forced to prey on domesticated animals that belong to people living in nearby localities.
This is the reason the animal is vulnerable as poison has been used by locals in the past to protect their livestock.
There have been reports of locals throwing meat laced with poison in the forest to get rid of the leopards.
“It is an established fact that in the past, poison as a deceptive weapon has been used against these predators and threat is imminent until relevant authorities do not come up with a plan to offer compensation to those whose animals are hunted by leopards,” said Quddus Abbasi, a resident of Shahdara village.
Leopards have killed over a dozen domesticated animals of different residents of nearby localities situated close to the terrain.
The residents, sharing their ordeals have asked authorities to establish a compensation fund, adding that a number of their goats and half a dozen cows and calves in the recent past have been hunted by wild cats causing them financial loss.
My cow was killed in a radius of just 200 metres from the house most probably by a leopard as villagers have seen it moving with a pair of cubs nearby, said Zakir Hussain.
The mosque cleric of the same locality, Abdul Rashid, said his only buffalo was hunted by leopards which was the source of bread and butter for his family. “I cannot afford to buy another as an average one costs Rs200,000,” he added.
According to information received through RTI, Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) found a body of a leopard in early 2018.
However, the source of suspected death of the animal could not be determined and samples are still at the laboratory.
After that, we increased our surveillance in the area and started awareness campaign regarding the importance of wildlife for the ecosystem, said IWMB Manager Operations Sakhawat Ali.
He said that the board, during the awareness campaign, engaged with the local community asking for their help in ensuring that the endangered animal remains safe.
When asked about the board’s view regarding compensation of the locals’ loses, he said there was no mechanism to compensate it.
He added there was no provision in law to fine those who kill the animal.

3,Sehat card scheme to be launched in Punjab in January: minister,Says each family to avail free treatment of up to Rs1 million per annum,"TAXILA: The government is going to launch a historic welfare scheme called Naya Pakistan Sehat Card from January under which every family in Punjab will be given a health card.
Minister for Social Welfare and Baitul Mal Syed Yawar Abbas Bukhari said this while talking to patients and their attendants during a surprise visit to District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital in Attock on Monday.
“In the first phase, Naya Pakistan Sehat Card programme will be started from the Lahore Division and later launched in six other divisions of the province,” Mr Bukhari said, adding that every family would be able to get free treatment of up to Rs1 million per annum against one ‘Naya Pakistan Sehat Card’.
As many as 30 million families and 11.5 million people would benefit from this programme.

Says each family to avail free treatment of up to Rs1 million per annum

People usually fall under the burden of debt to get their family members treated which is the reason this initiative is widely anticipated.
It is the completion of another promise made by Prime Minister Imran Khan to the nation.
He said the budget of the health sector was Rs169 billion in the tenure of the previous government, whereas, the current government has made a substantial increase and allocated Rs399 billion.
Mr Bukhari said currently work on projects worth over Rs6 billion was underway which included the Mother and Child Healthcare Hospital, upgradation of DHQ Hospital, Gondal Trauma Centre, Model Children Home, Social Services Unit and establishment of Rescue 1122 field offices in Sheenbagh and Durdad villages.
He said free vocational training of differently-abled people had begun in vocational training institutions whereas admission fees, tuition and hostel fees for them in government institutions had been abolished.
For the first time, he added, boards have been set up in all tehsil headquarters (THQ) hospitals for registration of differently-abled people, determination of disability and issuance of certificates.
We are now launching an online service that will allow people to apply for a disability certificate at home, he said.
The minister said there were 10 panagahs (shelter homes) in Punjab under the Social Welfare Department. “New panagahs at a cost of Rs185 million have been approved in Jhang, Multan and Sahiwal,” he added.

4,Housing society’s security guard shot dead,ISLAMABAD: The security guard of a housing society was allegedly shot dead by a villager over a land dispute on...,"ISLAMABAD: The security guard of a housing society was allegedly shot dead by a villager over a land dispute on Monday.
Police said the incident took place on open land in Bahria Enclave where development work is in progress. The security guard of the society spotted the man conducting work in Block-K.
The guard reached the spot and asked the man to vacate the land however he refused and said that he was the owner of the land, according to police.
The guard raised an objection and told the man that the land was purchased by the society and he was guarding it but the man denied this by saying that he had not sold the land to anyone.
This led to a harsh argument, following which the man pulled out a weapon and shot the guard. The man escaped afterwards.
The suspect, police said, is a resident of Tumair village.
Superintendent of Police (Rural Zone) Ziauddin told Dawn that the land where the incident took place was acquired by Bahria Enclave. The incident took place at a spot located on the boundary of the enclave where development work is underway, he said, adding the suspect was previously the accused in a murder and murder attempt case.

5,Protesters demand arrest of culprits involved in AJK resident’s murder,Traders kept the shutters of their shops down for more than an hour during which protest rally was taken out.,"MUZAFFARABAD: A large number of people staged a demonstration during a token shutter down in Abbaspur town of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) on Monday to protest against the recent killing of a resident of their area in a car-snatching incident in Rawalpindi.
On Wednesday last, some unknown persons had shot dead Khawaja Sohail Shafi in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Road before snatching his Suzuki Mehran car that he drove as taxi to eke out a living.
The father of two girls was laid to rest in his native village the following day, amid demands by hundreds of mourners to hunt down and award exemplary punishment to his killers.
On Monday, traders in Abbaspur pulled down the shutters of their shops for more than an hour during which they and people from various walks of life staged a rally to press the authorities concerned to dispense justice to the bereaved family.
Since no one from the families of slain Kashmiris can follow up the investigation process, the police sweep all such cases under the carpet, the protesters maintained, urging AJK inspector general of police Dr Sohail Habib Tajik to strongly take up this issue with the Punjab police.
Speakers also called upon Rawalpindi’s newly-appointed CPO Sajid Kiani to take personal interest in tracing and penalising the killers of Mr Shafi and recovering his vehicle.

6,Senate body to take up 10 private member’s bills on Thursday,Most of the bills’ movers are opposition members; crucial changes to various provisions of Constitution proposed.,"ISLAMABAD: The Senate Standing Committee on Law and Justice is set to take up 10 private member’s Constitution amendment bills, mostly moved by opposition members, in its meeting scheduled for Thursday (Dec 23).
Through these bills, the movers have suggested some crucial changes to various provisions of the Constitution related to the promulgation of ordinance, increase in the powers of the Senate, ensuring meaningful participation of the provinces in the affairs of the federation and fundamental rights of the citizens of Pakistan.
The committee is also set to take up a bill of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Senator Seemee Ezdi seeking allocation of seats for the people with disabilities in the Senate.
The proposed amendment to Article 59 reads as “two persons with disabilities, one from each province, shall be elected by the members of each provincial assembly”.

Most of the bills’ movers are opposition members; crucial changes to various provisions of Constitution proposed

The Statement of Objects and Reasons attached to the bill states that the 5th Population and Housing Census conducted in 1998 had identified the population of persons with disabilities (PWDs) in Pakistan to be 2.38 per cent of the entire population. After that no authentic data is available about their existing number so far.
According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), approximately 15pc of Pakistan’s population consists of persons with disabilities. Pakistan is a signatory state of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) according to which the government is committed to protecting the rights of the PWDs and to make them functional members of society through constitutional and legal provisions as well as practical measures on policy level also.
As the government has to ensure fair representation of marginalised groups, including the PWDs, in all government bodies, it has already passed Disabled Persons (Employment and Rehabilitation) Ordinance, 1981, to increase the representation of persons with disabilities in the public and private bodies.
There are seats currently reserved for various minority groups in the Senate, but not a single one for persons with disabilities.
The bill has been proposed to provide equal representation to PWDs in the Senate, which will have an impact on policy development and change the society’s image about persons with disabilities.
Another bill on the committee’s agenda is aimed at preventing the successive governments from misusing Article 89(2) of the Constitution which allows the government to promulgate ordinances when the National Assembly or the Senate is not in session.
The bill was moved by Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Senator Raza Rabbani during the Senate session on June 8, 2020. Through the bill, the PPP senator wants to make it binding upon the federal government to lay the ordinance in the first sitting of either house of the parliament after its promulgation, stating that in case of the failure of the government to do so, the ordinance “shall stand repealed” automatically.
Through another bill, Mr Rabbani has sought the right of speech and participation in the Senate proceedings for the provincial chief ministers.
“A chief minister shall have the right to speak and take part in the proceedings of the Senate of Pakistan when so invited by the [Senate] chairman, but shall not by virtue of this Article be entitled to vote,” says the proposed amendment to Article 57 of the Constitution, which allows the prime minister, who is the leader of the house in the National Assembly, to take part in the proceedings of the upper house.
Through another amendment, Mr Rabbani has sought to increase weightage of the votes of senators during the proceedings of the joint sitting of the parliament. The amendment has apparently been moved by the PPP senator in the wake of the present government’s dependence on doing legislation in the joint sitting of the parliament as it lacks majority in the Senate.
The proposed amendment to Article 72 of the Constitution reads: “Provided that one vote of a member of Senate shall be proportionate to the total number of seats in the National Assembly divided by the total number of seats in the Senate.”
If the formula is applied, then one vote of a senator will be equivalent to 3.4 votes as the National Assembly comprises 342 members whereas the total strength of the Senate is at present 100.
In the same bill, Mr Rabbani has sought an amendment to Article 160 of the Constitution, proposing that if the government fails to announce the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award within five years, “the government shall take permission from the Senate to extend the previous award for another year”.
It further says that “in case of extension, the Senate may increase the award for the provinces by one per cent”.

7,World off track in meeting SDGs on neonatal deaths: report,Says over 50 countries will not be able to reduce under-five mortality rate by 2030,"ISLAMABAD: The world remains significantly off track to meet the sustainable development goals (SDGs) related to ending preventable deaths of newborns and children under the age of five.
More than 50 countries will not meet the under-five mortality target by 2030 and more than 60 will miss the neonatal mortality target without immediate action.
These are the latest estimates released by United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME) on Monday.
As per the SDGs, all countries must aim to achieve a neonatal mortality rate of 12 or fewer deaths per 1,000 live births and an under-five mortality rate of 25 or fewer deaths per 1,000 live births by 2030.

Says over 50 countries will not be able to reduce under-five mortality rate by 2030

The report stated that more than five million children died before their fifth birthday in 2020 alone along with 2.2 million children and youth aged five to 24.
“We are still losing too many young lives from largely preventable causes, often because of weak and underfunded health systems which have faced enormous pressure over the pandemic. And the burden of these deaths is not carried equally around the world.
“Children in Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa continue to face the highest risk of death in the world and bear the brunt of this child mortality burden”, said Mark Hereward,United Nations Children Fund (Unicef) associate director on data and analytics in a statement.
“If we are going to achieve the child mortality SDGs in all countries, we must redouble efforts to ensure access to effective and high-quality care along with the continued expansion of coverage of life-saving interventions”, he added.
The UN IGME report stated that recent and reliable data on child, adolescent and youth mortality remains unavailable for most countries of the world, particularly for low-income countries, and the Covid-19 pandemic has posed additional challenges to improving data availability and quality.
Only about 60 countries, mainly high-income, have a well-functioning civil registration and vital statistics system, which produces timely, high-quality data on mortality.
In low and middle-income countries, huge data gaps remain; two thirds (97 out of 135 countries) have had no reliable mortality data in the past three years.
“Countries must invest in quality health services, nutrition, and other life-saving interventions for women and children to ensure the hard-won gains in combating child mortality are not lost and to meet the SDGs”, said Feng Zhao, practice manager for the Health, Nutrition and Population Global Practice of the World Bank.
Following an analysis of data and recommendations from its Technical Advisory Group, the UN IGME has not adjusted the 2020 rate for Covid-19-related mortality.
However, as more good-quality data becomes available, further monitoring is needed for a more complete picture of child, adolescent and youth mortality, as well as relevant contributing factors.
Future investments in the Covid-19 response and in global health should strengthen all elements of the global healthcare infrastructure including leaving a lasting impact on data and primary health systems to help end preventable child deaths.
“Intensified efforts are needed to deliver quality health care services for all children and adolescents, which also means collecting the necessary data to ensure that their physical, developmental and emotional needs are being met throughout their life”, said Dr Anshu Banerjee, director of Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health and Ageing at the World Health Organisation (WHO). “Investing in children is one of the most important things a society can do to build a better future”, she added.
It has been highlighted in the report that because data remains poor, outcomes for children and adolescents in 2021 and beyond remain unknown.
For instance, the pandemic may affect child mortality differently by age group and socio-economic status.

Speaking at an event organised by Rescue 1122 to honour 13 firefighters who lost their lives in the Gakhar Plaza fire incident on Dec 20, 2008, Mr Naseem said implementation of Punjab Community Safety Act 2021 would be ensured to make Pakistan safer.
He saluted the martyrs and said lack of fire safety arrangements in high-rise buildings had led to the tragedy.
Out of the 13, four belonged to Punjab Emergency Service (Rescue 1122), one to Municipal Fire Brigade Rawalpindi, six to Pakistan Ordnance Factories (POF) Wah and two to Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).
Regional Emergency Officer Dr Abdul Rehman told participants that Dec 20 was a reminder of how the 13 men sacrificed their lives while trying to put out the fire.
Director General of Punjab Emergency Service (Rescue 1122) Dr Rizwan Naseer directed officials to organise special services for the martyrs across Punjab.
After the incident, Rescue 1122 improved its capabilities by increasing the number of modern vehicles and equipment it possessed.
Furthermore, the Punjab Community Safety Act 2021 has been passed by the Punjab Assembly, giving legal status to establishment of a safe society.
District Emergency Officer (DEO) Ali Hussain welcomed the guests for being part of the ceremony. Abeer Riaz thanked the officials, fire brigade and participants of the event.
Afterwards, the guests laid floral wreaths at the memorial and then special prayers were offered.
At the end of the ceremony, the DEO reaffirmed his commitment towards ensuring great service.
Ghulam Mohammad Naz, vice president of the Fire Safety Association of Pakistan (Ghazi Gakhar Plaza), while paying tribute to the martyrs, said it was the moral and social duty of all of us to act like responsible citizens by identifying dangers in high-rise buildings.

11,Opening of bids to hire consultant for project in capital’s educational institutions delayed,New date set for Dec 29; uplift scheme worth Rs6.9bn to be executed in phases,"ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training has postponed the process of opening financial bids of consultant firms to be hired for a mega project aimed at providing basic facilities in 189 educational institutions of Islamabad till December 29.
The ministry was supposed to open the bids on Dec 20, however, due to the meeting of the foreign ministers of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), which concluded on Monday, the process was delayed till Dec 29.
Sources said around 10 consultant firms had submitted their bids, adding that other interested companies could also join the process till Dec 28 and the bids would be opened on Dec 29.
The consultant will be supposed to prepare a detailed design and supervise the project worth around Rs7 billion.

New date set for Dec 29; uplift scheme worth Rs6.9bn to be executed in phases

It is a flagship project of the education ministry headed by Federal Minister Shafqat Mahmood, who played the main role in getting funds allocated in the fiscal year 2021-22.
“The successful bidder will prepare a detailed design and survey. Then we will move for calling tenders to award the work,” said an official of the ministry.
A senior officer of the Federal Directorate of Education (FDE) said the project, ‘Provision of basic facilities in educational institutions of ICT’ worth Rs6.9 billion will be executed in phases and for the current fiscal year the government has already allocated Rs409 million for it.
Under the reform programme launched by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, around 200 schools were face-lifted in the capital. As the remaining 183 schools were not part of the project, the education ministry and the FDE got funds approved for the new project. Besides civil works, the project will provide basic facilities, including IT labs, in the institutions.
FDE officials said most of the buildings in schools were in a dilapidated condition requiring rehabilitation on a priority basis to ensure safety of students.
A working paper of FDE stated: “Project was prepared keeping in view the fact that FDE has mostly retained educational institutions handed over from the government of Punjab in 1973 and 1985.”
A substantial portion of these buildings is in a dilapidated condition requiring rehabilitation on a priority basis to ensure safety of the students in a conducive environment for quality education.
Whereas annual repair and maintenance of buildings is a recurring feature of civil work, there are no funds allocated to schools/colleges of FDE to maintain their physical infrastructure.
The working paper said it is only the PSDP which meets the infrastructural needs of institutions be it the rehabilitation of existing facilities or construction of new structures.
Recently, the government through an ordinance had decided to place the FDE under the yet to be elected mayor. However, teachers resisted the move and during their meeting with the federal minister they appreciated his efforts to get funds for the project.
They stated that if the FDE was devolved to the local government and the mayor, such mega projects could not be executed in future as only the federal government could fund them.

Last month, the CDA board in its meeting named the newly-constructed PWD interchange after nuclear scientist Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan.
Sources said that in the same meeting the board had also directed that a decision taken in 2019 for naming three roads after Josh Malihabadi, Jameeluddin Aali and Hafeez Jalandhari should also be implemented.
Now the civic agency will send the four names to the federal government for final approval.
In 2019, the CDA board had recommended renaming Service Road (West) of D-12 as Josh Malihabadi Road, Service Road (South) D-12 as Jameeluddin Aali Road and Service Road (East) D-12 as Hafeez Jalandhari Road.
Signboards will be installed on the newly-named roads after formal approval from the competent forum.
Josh Malihabadi was a prominent Pakistani poet and had also worked for the Anjuman Taraqqi-i-Urdu. He was awarded Hilal-i-Imtiaz by the government.
Jameeluddin Aali was a poet, critic, playwright, columnist and scholar.
He wrote many books as well as national songs. He was awarded Pride of Performance and Hilal-i-Imtiaz.
Hafeez Jalandhari was an Urdu poet who wrote the national anthem. He actively participated in Pakistan Movement and used his writings to inspire people for the cause of Pakistan.
CDA usually names roads after renowned personalities and national heroes for creating awareness among the new generation about the outstanding services rendered by these people.
So far, over 100 roads have been named after prominent personalities. The current CDA board which comprises government officers and people from the private sector has also two members with literary background.
Renowned poet Iftikhar Arif is a private member of the board while CDA member finance Rana Shakeel Asghar is also a poet.
When contacted, CDA member Shakeel Asghar said the three personalities had great literary contribution and the civic agency was going to name roads after them which was long due.
