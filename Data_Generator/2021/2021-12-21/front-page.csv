• Result of Peshawar mayor election halted due to postponement of polling     
PESHAWAR: The Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) has managed to grab the highest number of mayor / chairman seats in the elections for 39 tehsils of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa held on Sunday. 
According to the provisional results of 39 of the 63 tehsils declared by the Election Commission of Pakistan on Monday, the JUI-F not only won 15 seats of mayor / chairman but also gave tough fight in many other tehsils where its candidates stood runners-up. 
In the provincial capital, the JUI-F stunned its rival Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) and has a definitive lead in the contest for the mayor of Peshawar city. JUI-F candidate Haji Zubair Ali secured 62,388 votes against 50,659 votes secured by PTI’s Rizwan Bangash. 
However, the results for the election of mayor have been stopped by the ECP on account of postponement of polling on six polling stations due to law and order situation there. Of the remaining six tehsil chairman seats of Peshawar, the JUI-F managed to clinch four while the PTI could get one seat of tehsil chairman from the provincial capital. 
It is for the first time that the JUI-F made its mark in the provincial capital, far from its traditional power base of southern KP. Interestingly, the JUI-F also emerged victorious in Charsadda, beating the Awami National Party (ANP) at the home turf. Also, the JUI-F emerged powerful in Mardan, where its candidate lost the mayor seat to the ANP with a margin of 6,000 votes. 
In Mardan, the JUI-F secured three seats and the ANP emerged victorious on two of the five tehsil seats. 
In Nowsehra, the PTI and ANP grabbed one seat of tehsil chairman each, while the result from the third tehsil was awaited. PTI candidate Ishaq Khattak, son of defence minister, won the seat by securing over 49,000 votes against the JUI-F candidate who secured over 40,000 votes. 
In Swabi, the JUI-F, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and the ANP and the PTI won a tehsil chairman seat each. 
Of the three Kohat tehsils, the JUI-F candidate and an independent secured one chairman seat each, while the results of third tehsil were awaited. 
In Bannu, the JUI-F emerged victorious in one of the six tehsils, while results of the five remaining tehsils were awaited.  
Also, both tehsils of Tank were won by the JUI-F. 
However, in Dera Ismail Khan — the hometown of JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman — provisional results of four of the six tehsils showed the PTI, Jamaat-i-Islami, Pakistan Peoples Party and an independent secured one tehsil chairman seat each. 
In Buner district, the ruling PTI showed strength by winning four of the six chairman seats. Result of one tehsil was still awaited, while another went to the ANP. 
In Haripur, the PML-N got two seats, while the third seat went to an independent. 
While results of the remaining tehsils have not been declared, the JUI-F was said to be leading in six tehsils, the PTI in four, independent three, the ANP in two and the PPP in one tehsil. 
In the first phase the local bodies’ elections were held in 17 districts of the province on Sunday, while local government polls in the remaining districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa would be conducted on January 16, 2022.

1,Zardari makes cryptic remarks about appeal for his ‘help’,Ex-president doesn’t say who sought his assistance but claims he insisted on govt’s removal first.,"HYDERABAD: Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari has said that he has already predicted that the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government could not deliver and this “hotchpotch sort” of government could not last.  
Without naming anyone, the former president said that he was asked to offer assistance and share some formula but he told them that first this government should be sent packing and then talks could be held.  
He was addressing party workers at Zardari House and a reception hosted in his honour by MPA Tariq Masood Arain in Nawabshah on Monday.  
He said that building Pakistan was easy but they could neither build the country nor listen and understand. But time would come that they would have to listen, understand and follow our advice, he said without naming anyone.  

Ex-president doesn’t say who sought his assistance, but claims he insisted on govt’s removal first

The PPP leader expressed concern over the present situation Pakistan is facing. He said that the rulers ate, earned dollars and slept whereas the country’s debt had risen from $30bn to $60bn. “We have best economic wizards and we have the ability to get rid of debt,” he said. “The longer they [rulers] stay the more difficulties will have to be faced to undo the wrong.”  
He said the PPP had taken care of Pakistan and would take care of it again.   
“I had said earlier that if NAB (National Accountability Bureau) keeps working, this government will not work and today they [government] are running NAB and not government,” he asserted and said that secretaries of government departments were not willing to sign papers. “Now relaxation is being given to bureaucrats in NAB laws but it is of no avail because damage has already been done”, he said.  
He said that rate of dollar had risen considerably and it was hovering over Rs180. “The country doesn’t need devaluation (of rupee) and those talking about devaluation are fool and this has harmed the country,” he said.  
He said that PPP had given jobs to people and raised salaries of government employees while controlling price hike and keep dollar’s rate under check. He accused PTI government of destroying everything. “There is a tsunami of price hike and a mini budget is being presented”, he said. He said the PPP never rendered anyone jobless and would not do so again when elected to power. He said Benazir Bhutto used to say if giving jobs to people was a crime then it would be committed again and again.  
He said that he had stated in his first speech in parliament after 2018 general elections that this “hotchpotch sort” of government would not deliver. “But now situation has come to such a pass that people ask me for assistance and or to share a formula and devise a mechanism. I said first this government should be sent packing and then we will start talking. We will take care of Pakistan as we have earlier done it. Whenever Pakistan faces a difficult situation PPP has rescued the country.”  
He said that sugar was imported during Musharraf regime but the PPP government made the country self-sufficient in sugar in just one year.   
“We have to think about future generation as to what would happen after 15 years”.  
In a lighter vein and using cricket parlance, he said that he had just stepped in Lahore and he would face their pitch and bowling and would go for a sixer. “I just need your prayers to have more strength.” He said: “I would make them understand Bhuttoism and make them run.”  
He said people would see that Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari would become prime minister. He said that PPP had been fighting and would keep fighting.   
He said that commodities prices had increased substantially and mutton was being sold for Rs1,400 per kg.   
He said that Pakistan was a blessed country gifted by God and created by Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah. “It’s true that we faced losses but today we have our own country. Look at India. What is happening with Muslims there,” he said.   
Mr Zardari said that till today people tried to harm the Bhuttos. “Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Benazir Bhutto are fighting from their graves and we are fighting on their behalf,” he said.   
He said that he had accepted responsibility he owed to the PPP. “Bibi used to say she didn’t chose politics but politics chose her”, he said. He said that Benazir Bhutto guided and spoke to him. “Do you think I am kidding? She is always in my thoughts and is with me. I often think what she would have done and what Z.A. Bhutto would have done today”, he said.

2,SC suspends Sindh govt’s minimum wage decision,Forms a three-judge bench to hear the matter next month.,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court suspended on Monday the Sindh government’s July 19 notification of raising the minimum wage for workers to Rs25,000 per month, but decided to set up a three-judge bench to hear the matter next month.
A two-judge Supreme Court bench, consisting of Justice Qazi Faez Isa and Justice Yahya Afridi, issued notices to Attorney General of Pakistan (AGP) Khalid Jawed Khan and Sindh Advocate General Salman Talibuddin on a set of appeals moved by a number of petitioners. 
The Federation of Pakis­tan Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the Employers Federation of Pakistan, Phoenix Security Service (Pvt) Ltd Karachi, Aziz Tabba Foundation Karachi, Gray Marchenzie Restaurants International Limited Karachi and SRG Service (Pvt) Limited Karachi are the petitioners.
One of the organisations challenged the minimum wage notification with a contention that “ours is a  trans-provincial organisation and comes under the federal legislative regime with regard to the fixation of minimum wages and that the Sindh Minimum Wages Act (SMWA) 2015 is not applicable to us”. 
Some of the petitioners questioned an Oct 15 Sindh High Court order in favour of the provincial government’s notification while others moved the apex court to become a party in the controversy with a plea that the high court order was affecting them.
A five-page order issued about a Supreme Court hearing that took place on Dec 7 recalled how the petitioners — the Sindh-based organisations — promised that they would make a payment of Rs19,000 per month to their employees with effect from July 1 this year. 
Likewise, the “trans-provincial organisations” gave an undertaking that they would pay Rs20,000 per month to their employees from the date applicable and continue to do so until a decision by the apex court.
In case the Supreme Court upheld the SHC’s decision, the petitioners gave an assurance, they would pay the balance amount to their workers.
Upon this commitment, the Supreme Court suspended the Sindh government’s notification till the next hearing.
Abid S. Zuberi, Ayan M. Memon and some others represented the petitioners.
They pleaded that under section 3 of the SMWA, a minimum wage board has been established and a mechanism for fixation prescribed.
The rules require that the board first propose a minimum wage and then submit its recommendation to the provincial government. 
The government then publishes a notification in the Gazette under Section 6(1)(a) of the SMWA stating whether it agrees or not with the board’s recommendation. If it does not agree, it refers the matter back to the board for reconsideration.
The petitioners pleaded that the board had recommended a minimum wage of Rs19,000 per month, raising it from  Rs17,500.
But the Sindh cabinet raised the wage to Rs25,000 per month without issuing a gazette notification.
Instead, the petitioners contended, a gazette notification was issued on Nov 12 pursuant to the Sindh High Court’s order.
The petitioners argued that although the provincial government was empowered to refer the matter back to the board with its comments, the government does not have the power to itself determine the minimum wage.
In its order, the Supreme Court held that the controversy demanded a thorough review and issued notices to the  Sindh government’s labour secretary and the Employers Federation of Pakistan, Karachi.
Notices were also issued to the AGP under Section 27-A of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908 as well as to the Sindh advocate general with a directive to appear before the apex court next month before a three-judge bench.

3,NCOC allows people over 30 to get booster shots from Jan 1,Agrees to take strict measures to enforce obligatory vaccination regime and reviews province-wise vaccination targets.,"ISLAMABAD: The National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) on Monday allowed booster shots for people over the age of 30 years as Covid-19’s latest strain, Omicron, infects 58,000 people in 95 countries.
On the other hand, as a large number of people have been denied travel by several countries because of vaccine “discrimination”, mix-and-match booster vaccine shots have been permitted free of cost.
The term mix-and-match refers to an arrangement under which a person gets a booster shot of a vaccine which is different from the one he/she had received earlier.
People over the age of 50 years and immune-compromised persons were earlier allowed to get free booster jabs of the same vaccine they had received earlier.
However, a large number of people intending to go abroad could not do so as many nations were allowing quarantine-free entry only to those inbound passengers who had been administered the vaccine approved by them. Therefore, the government introduced a paid mix-and-match booster facility for travellers to spare them quarantine.
Talking to Dawn, Director General, Ministry of National Health Services (NHS), Dr Rana Safdar, said booster doses of choice would be given to people.
“It means that mix and match has been allowed or booster of the same company, which was administered earlier, can be given as per choice of the people,” he said.
Dr Safdar said people over the age of 30 years could get booster shots from Jan 1 for free.
Meanwhile, the NCOC on Monday discussed the epidemic curve chart data, national vaccine strategy and disease prevalence across the country.
According to a statement, the forum agreed to take strict measures to enforce obligatory vaccination regime and reviewed province-wise vaccination targets. 
It said a total of 141,509,339 doses had been administered till date.
“Omicron variant has been reported in 95 countries, with 58,000 confirmed cases till now,” the statement said, adding that Europe was the epicentre, and the United Kingdom and Denmark had the highest number of patients. 
It further said 149 confirmed cases of Omicron had so far been recorded in India.
The NCOC once again urged people to get fully inoculated to save themselves from getting infected by the new variant.

4,Current account deficit hits $7bn in five months,November sees the highest monthly current account deficit in over three years.,"KARACHI: The country’s current account recorded a deficit of $7 billion in the first five months (July to November) of the current fiscal year, mainly on account of increasing imports, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) data showed on Monday. 
At $1.91bn, November saw the highest monthly current account deficit since July 2018 when it reached $2.1bn. This was the year when the country faced a record $20bn current account deficit. 
Besides, the five-month figure of $7bn this year stands in total contrast to a current account surplus of $1.64bn during the same period a year ago. 
The current account deficit widened from $1.76bn in October to $1.91bn in November “as imports outstripped strong exports [and] robust remittances”, the SBP tweeted. “Imports were mainly lifted by high international commodity prices in addition to strong domestic economic recovery.” 

November sees highest monthly CA deficit in over three years

In its Dec 14 monetary policy, the SBP said the current account deficit for the ongoing fiscal year would come in at 4pc of GDP — higher than earlier forecast of 2-3pc of GDP. 
However, the five-month deficit has already reached 5.3pc, leaving no chance of a decline amid a rising import bill. 
It was also noted that the import bill for November shown by the State Bank was $6.423bn — significantly lower than the figures provided by the Pakistan Bureau of Statics (PBS), whose data shows the imports of goods was $7.928bn during the month. 
As compared to the central bank’s data, the import bill reflected by the PBS was higher by $202m in July, $579m in August, $542m in September, $358m in October, and $1.5 billion in November. 
Some analysts were particularly sceptical about the stark difference in the November figures. However, some believed the difference would be adjusted the next month since the State Bank compiles data after the payment through banks while PBS’s figures are based on information provided by Pakistan Customs, which means it relies on the physical movement of goods. 
As per the PBS data, the imports of goods in November jumped 84pc to $7.927bn compared to the same month a year ago. Similarly, the July-November import bill went up by 70pc to $33bn from $19.5bn in the same period last year. 
The current account deficit is on the rise, as the government struggles to curtail the import bill while the exports posted modest year-on-year growth of 27pc during the five months to November. 
According to the SBP data, the deficit was $773m in July, $1.473bn in August, $1.113bn in September, $1.76bn in October, and $1.908bn in November. 
Analysts believe the current account deficit may hit $15bn by the end of this fiscal year. 
The government is striving to maintain the foreign exchange reserves at an adequate level to mitigate the impact of a ballooning current account deficit. Despite borrowed foreign exchange, the reserves have been declining during the current fiscal year, adversely affecting the exchange rate and resulting in the rupee’s depreciation. 
Foreign exchange reserves held by the central bank fell by 7pc in November, indicating lower inflows. Meanwhile, the country neither received the expected $1bn loan from the International Monetary Fund nor could it launch Sukuk bonds which it planned to raise $1-1.5bn from the international market.
