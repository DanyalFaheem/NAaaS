0,"Co-suspect indicted in money laundering reference against Shehbaz, family",Judge directs NAB prosecution team to present witnesses at next hearing.,"LAHORE: An accountability court on Monday indicted a co-suspect in the money laundering reference against Leader of Opposition in National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif and his family.
The co-suspect, Ahmad Ali, denied the charges against him and decided to contest the trial.
Presiding Judge Sajid Ali Awan directed the prosecution team of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to present its witnesses on the next hearing.
The judge also allowed an application of Shehbaz’s son Hamza, who leads opposition in the Punjab Assembly, seeking exemption from personal appearance in the references of money laundering and Ramzan Sugar Mills on medical grounds.
The application said Hamza had a severe back pain and the doctors had advised him bed rest for at least ten days.
However, Shehbaz appeared before the court and attended the proceedings against him in the references.
The NAB filed its reply to the acquittal applications of two co-suspects — Bilal Qidwai and Imtiaz Haider — in Ashiana-i-Iqbal Housing Scheme reference.
The court adjourned further hearing till Jan 10 for arguments on the acquittal applications.
In the money laundering reference, the NAB alleged that the family members and benamidars of Shehbaz received fake foreign remittances worth billions in their personal bank accounts. In addition to these remittances, the bureau said, billions of rupees were laundered by way of foreign pay orders, which were deposited in personal bank accounts of his sons Hamza and Suleman.
Shahbaz, his wife Ms Nusrat and son Hamza had been indicted in the case. Being out of the country, Ms Nusrat joined the trial proceedings through a pleader with the permission of the court.
LG ordinance: The Lahore High Court on Monday issued notices on a petition challenging the Punjab Local Government Ordinance 2021 and also sought assistance from the advocate general.
Justice Shahid Jamil Khan was hearing a petition of Sialkot district council chairperson Hina Arshad.
Petitioner’s counsel Imran Raza Chaddhar submitted the impugned ordinance envisaged dissolution of the existing local bodies till Jan 1, 2021 and the use of the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) in the next polls in the province.
He said the provincial government, with a mala fide intention, had been trying to change the local government system according to its own whims.
He said the new law also permitted election of non-elected representatives through a direct vote and the chief minister had been given powers, making the local government system ineffective.
The counsel argued that the use of the EVMs without the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP’s) approval and deliberations by the political parties was an undemocratic decision of the government. He also challenged the appointment of administrators after the dissolution of the existing local government system.
He argued that the ordinance was in violation of various provisions of the Constitution and liable to be set aside.
After hearing the arguments, the judge issued notices to the respondents and also sought assistance from the advocate general of Punjab at the hearing on Dec 23.
Meanwhile, Justice Shahid Waheed referred a similar petition by Faisalabad Mayor Razzaq Malik to Justice Shahid Jamil Khan who was already seized with other petitions on the local government law.

1,PML-N sees PTI’s ‘rout’ in Punjab local polls,"""Lawlessness and incompetence tabdeeli is on its way out,"" says Maryam Nawaz; Azma Bokhari says more thrashing in store for PTI.","LAHORE: The PML-N sees ‘more thrashing’ of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) in Punjab than Khyber Pakhtunkhwa local body polls, saying the so-called ‘tabdeeli (change)’ is on its way out.
In a reference to the PTI’s defeat in KP local body election, PML-N Vice President Maryam Nawaz said on Monday in a tweet: “After being shamed, slandered and receiving the curse of millions and pushing a nation of 220 million into a mire of inflation, lawlessness and incompetence tabdeeli (change) is on its way out.”

 



 
PML-N Punjab information secretary Azma Bokhari said more thrashing for the PTI in Punjab was in store in upcoming local elections.
“The PTI faced the wrath of the people in KP local polls and now the worst for the ruling party is in waiting in Punjab,” she said and added it is a referendum against the government and now if any shame is left Prime Minister Imran Khan should resign. “The people in every nook and corner of the country are demanding resignation from Imran Khan,” she said.
The PML-N lawmaker said the Buzdar administration did not want to hold local government polls in Punjab knowing well what would happen to the PTI.
Talking to reporters outside the Punjab Assembly here on Monday, she said: “The people in KP held the funeral of PTI and Punjab will bury it.”

“Increase in prices of electricity and essential commodities every month is economic exploitation and murder of the hard-working people of Pakistan. Each one of these tariff hikes reminds the nation that the prime minister is a thief,” he said in a statement on Monday.
Shehbaz said Imran Niazi had claimed that he would eliminate the circular debt; however, despite hikes in electricity tariffs, the circular debt was at an all-time high. He added that Imran-led government had virtually doubled the circular debt despite increasing electricity tariffs manifold.
“Raising electricity prices is not the solution to the problem. The real problem is the corruption and incompetence of this imposed regime that is taking the country to a point of no return,” the former chief minister said and stressed that the problems of the people and the economy should not be worsened any further and the government should resign instead of hurting the nation further.
The opposition leader said the government had become a cancer for the country and the only way of survival was to remove this cancer.
“The gas crisis continues to worsen by the day as the winter becomes intense. People are paying the price of the government’s inaction, corruption and gross mismanagement. The industry is also suffering from the gas shortage. What is worse, the rulers remain in denial,” he said.

3,"Buzdar, Parvez discuss strategy for local polls in Punjab",PML_Q Punjab chief says alliance is moving forward with sincerity.,"LAHORE: In the wake of humiliating defeat suffered by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf in the local government polls in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Chief Minister Usman Buzdar and ruling party ally PML-Q’s Punjab chief Chaudhry Parvez Elahi met here on Monday and discussed strategy to contest the upcoming local elections in Punjab.
The two leaders discussed in detail the option of contesting local government elections next year by fielding joint candidates.
The chief minister said the PML-Q was an ally party of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and the alliance must continue the consultation process.
Mr Buzdar said the LG system would practically devolve power to the grassroots level to provide relief to the masses. He said the PTI and its allies’ journey of public service would be accelerated without caring for any criticism.
Mr Elahi said the alliance was moving forward with sincerity.
“We are an ally of the government and will remain so,” he said and added that discussions on launching joint candidates in the upcoming local polls in Punjab would continue.
The chief minister regretted that the opposition was pursuing an agenda that was contrary to the national interest and added that the opposition alliance Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) did not like the national development.
Mr Buzdar said the people needed development and prosperity, instead of anarchy. However, he said, the opposition had disappointed people on every national issue.
“Those engaged in the politics of chaos should keep in view the facts as the people were fully aware of their dual nature,” he said, referring to the opposition.
The chief minister advised the opposition to understand that people could not be served with hollow statements.
“One has to stand with the masses to serve the people,” he said and added that the PTI leadership was standing with the people and it would continue to do so in future as well.
Principal Secretary to CM Aamir Jan, Punjab Assembly Secretary Muhammad Khan Bhatti and others were also present on the occasion.
Meanwhile, PML-N Punjab information secretary Azma Bukhari said the party thought that the government was running away from holding local polls in the province, seeing its defeat was a writing on the wall.
“The Punjab government does not want to hold local body polls, as it knows that the PTI will face a humiliating defeat here,” Ms Bukhari said.

Speaking at a seminar on “Radicalisation of youth: challenges for Pakistani universities” organised by the University of Okara at Pearl Continental hotel on Monday, he said tolerance was running out among the people and everyone wanted to impose his point of view on others.
Sarwar said: “Extremism is on the rise all over the world and they will have to unite against it. Extremism and terrorism have nothing to do with Islam.”
He said Narendra Modi was not questioned by the world for killing innocent people in Kashmir and other minorities in his country.
Speaking on the issue of Afghanistan, he said time had proved that war was not the solution to the problems and the world was ignoring the Afghanistan crisis.
He said the world must work for the development and stability of Afghanistan to avert a major human tragedy otherwise the region and the world would not be able to control the situation in coming days.
UO Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Zakria Zakar said the roots of the rising radicalisation in youth were in our socialisation process and our universities were facing a challenge in this regard.
“Radicalisation is not only a problem of law and order, but its solution rests in the correction of our social behaviours,” he said.
GCU VC Prof Dr Asghar Zaidi said there was a dire need to promote healthy co-curricular and extracurricular activities in educational institutions in order to mitigate radicalisation.
University of Jhang VC Dr Shahid Munir said radicalisation in the Pakistani society grew as a result of the Afghan war and its further causes included political unrest and social injustice.
University of Health Sciences VC Prof Dr Javed Akram argued it was necessary to take care of the mental health of the youth in order to fix the problem of radicalisation.
Punjab Ombudsman Nabila Khan was of the view that the factors like weak educational system, socio-economic differences and unavailability of a national curriculum were the main causes of radicalisation.

He was addressing a press conference with PPP Lahore President Aslam Gill here on Monday. He said the country has become food insecure as farmers are disappointed at the government’s policies.
Mr Ashraf said that every segment of society, including farmers, was protesting against the government’s policies but the government was issuing “all is okay” reports.
He said the country needed to produce more wheat, cotton, rice and maize to meet requirements of the increasing population but the official policies were deteriorating the condition of the farmers.
The government is increasing prices of electricity and gas on a daily basis without any justification and the farmer says that the higher production costs have reduced their profit margin, he said.
The former prime minister said the incumbent rulers were doing nothing but making tall claims and attacking their opponents as the government was failing to provide fertilizers and seeds to the farmers at official rates.
He said the PPP was standing by the peasants both inside and outside the parliament and cautioned that if their problems were not resolved, the food security situation would worsen.

-DAWN

 
GUJRAT: The cutlery and stainless utensils manufacturers have been waiting for possession of their plots of land in Wazirabad Small Industrial Estate for the last many years.
The Gujranwala divisional administration has been directed by the government to develop Wazirabad city as a model industrial town after which the city has also been included in the regional economic growth strategy, official sources said.
The Pakistan Cutlery and Stainless Utensils Manufacturers Association recently asked Gujranwala Commissioner Zulfiqar Ghuman to play his role in expediting the process of handing over plots of land to the manufacturers who had already been allotted the plots some years back.
Mr Ghuman had visited the industrial estate area around a week ago where he was briefed by the officials of the cutlery association on the issues pertaining to the delay in making the industrial area functional.
Though 90pc of the infrastructural development of the facility has already been completed at the site but incomplete uplift work and non-provision of electricity and gas pipeline have been major hurdles to it.
At least 14 kanals have been mutated in the name of Gujranwala Electric Power Company (Gepco) for setting up a dedicated grid station but Rs400m are required to provide the electricity and gas connections at the site. At least, 202 plots measuring one kanal, 32 plots of two kanals, 15 of four kanals and 23 plots of 10 marlas have been marked.
The industrialists who were allotted plots have already paid amounts to the Punjab Small Industries Corporation (PSIC); however, they are asked to pay Rs800,000 more as charges of gas and electricity, Khalid Mughal, the chairman of cutlery association, said and added that the local manufacturers had been demanding the government to bear the expenditures required for provision of such facilities.
It is pertinent to mention that at least 1,500 to 2,000 small and medium manufacturing units of cutlery and stainless utensils have been functional in various residential localities of Wazirabad since long.
The local manufacturers have also been demanding establishment of an industrial area in the town for the last almost five decades, says another official of the association who adds that the lack of political support as well as internal issues of the association have been the major reasons behind the delay. He deplores that Wazirabad does not have a powerful voice in the federal and provincial cabinets since long as the neighbouring towns of Gujrat, Gujranwala and Sialkot have been having political representations in the government set-ups and they helped their respective business fraternity to achieve such goals.
The government of Shehbaz Sharif had launched the project of establishing an industrial estate area in Wazirabad in 2014 for the cottage industry on public-private partnership; however, it is yet to bear any fruits for the manufacturers despite of spending a huge amount on the project.

Regarding the situation, the district representative of the All Pakistan Fertiliser Dealers Association, Muhammad Anas, and fertiliser dealer Muhammad Farooq spoke to reporters on the issue of the unavailability of fertiliser. They said the demand for urea was 6.4 million tons, whereas the available stock in the market was six million tons. Similarly, DAP demand was 2.2 million tons, but due to its high prices, the usage had gone down considerably.
During the last season, the per bag rate of DAP was Rs4,200, which increased to Rs8,700 this year. They said the manufacturing contents of DAP were imported whose rates had gone up due to the devaluation of the rupee.
Fertiliser Dealers Association president Muhammad Irshad told Dawn the district administration was forcing was forcing them to sell the commodity at controlled rates, which was rather unfeasible for them. He said adequate supplies and demand would help lower the rates in the open market.
Currently, the government is importing one million ton of urea to beat the shortage.
Small dealers, however, say the big dealers of the fertilisers are minting huge profit margins and that the district administration was informed by the fertiliser companies regarding the supply of their products to them. They say even though there is a shortage of urea, the rates are higher than the shortage proportion. The official rate of urea is Rs1,768 per bag, which also included a Rs40 per bag profit, but the rate has gone up to Rs2,300 per bag which has only increased the profit margin of big dealers.
Kissan Board Pakistan’s Shaukat Chaddar says the government has no control over the market, resulting in the helplessness of farmers.
Progressive farmers Saleem Raza Kharl and Mahr Amir Ali Kalason said that within two to three weeks, the cultivation of maize crop would start and after one month of the sowing, urea fertiliser would be required for the crop. If the urea supply is not improved, the crisis may be uncontrollable, they fear, and demanded that the government take immediate measures to avoid any untoward situation. They said Okara, being the hub of potatoes, maize and vegetable cultivation, should not face fertiliser shortage.
Potato Growers Association vice-president Maqsood Ahmad Jatt demanded that the government arrange a joint meeting of farmers and representatives of fertiliser companies, dealers, small dealers and district administration to discuss the situation.
