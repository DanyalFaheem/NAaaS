0,Independent rulings restore public trust in courts: IHC CJ,Registrar office submits sealed affidavit of former GB chief judge,"ISLAMABAD: Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Athar Minallah on Monday reiterated that he did not believe in maintaining court’s dignity through contempt proceedings as independent judgements restored public confidence in courts.  
During the hearing of a contempt of court case based on an affidavit by former chief judge of Gilgit-Baltistan Rana Mohammad Shamim, Justice Minallah said the court was probing the matter to dispel an impression that the IHC judges were compromised.  
He also advised amicus curiae Nasir Zaidi, a representative of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ), to consider the hearing as an inquiry, and not a contempt proceeding.  
During hearing, the registrar office submitted the sealed affidavit of Rana Shamim.
Justice Minallah had earlier directed the former GB judge to produce original copy of the affidavit and warned of consequences for not complying with the order.  

Registrar office submits sealed affidavit of former GB chief judge

In the affidavit, Rana Shamim has accused former chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) Saqib Nisar of delaying the release of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz.  
In response to the show-cause notice issued by the IHC chief justice to Rana Shamim and others over publication of the affidavit in an English daily, the ex-GB chief judge claimed that he had neither circulated nor shared the affidavit with anyone. 
Rana Shamim in his affidavit claimed that Justice Saqib Nisar had during his visit to Gilgit-Baltistan made a call to an IHC judge and asked him to ensure that Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz were not granted bail before the 2018 general election.  
The statement submitted to the IHC said: “The events mentioned in the affidavit occurred on July 15, 2018 around evening time, approximately 6pm, while we were having tea and refreshments together at the official rest house of the Supreme Appellate Court of Gilgit-Baltistan.”  
Mr Shamim expressed his willingness to testify the affidavit even in front of the former CJP. The statement said he is “ready to state the facts mentioned in statement on solemn oath and the answering respondent [Rana Shamim] is ready to confront the person mentioned in the affidavit i.e. former chief justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar”.  
Meanwhile, the IHC chief justice also took up an application filed by senior journalist Ansar Abbasi against private TV channel ARY.  
In the application, Mr Abbasi pointed out that the TV channel had wrongly attributed fake remarks to IHC Chief Justice Minallah.  
It may be mentioned that the IHC administration following the broadcast of fake news also issued a press release.  
Justice Minallah remarked that since the press release could not be issued against any specific TV channel, it didn’t name any media outfit. However, he said Mr Abbasi’s application pointed out a news item which was factually incorrect and misreported.  
The court adjourned the hearing to December 28.

But when smoke started drifting out, she opened the door and found the room filled with smoke.  
The DIG said that both brothers were taken to Benazir Bhutto Hospital where they could not survive and were pronounced dead.

2,JUI-F victory in local bodies polls confirms PTI govt is fake: Fazl,Invites Aslam Raisani to join his party,"QUETTA: Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman has said the victory of a large number of his party’s candidates in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa local bodies’ elections has proved that the PTI government is fake and it has been imposed on the masses by ‘selectors’. 
Talking to journalists after meeting former Balochistan chief minister Nawab Mohammad Aslam Raisani at his residence on Monday, Maulana Fazl, who is also president of the Pakis­tan Democratic Movement (PDM), said that despite interference and casting of fake votes, PTI candidates suffered massive defeat in the local bodies’ elections in KP and people had given mandate to the JUI-F candidates. 
Maulana Fazl went to Sarawan House along with JUI-F secretary general Senator Abdul Ghafoor Haidari, provincial chief MNA Maulana Abdul Wasey, MNA Maulana Salah Uddin Ayubi and other party leaders to invite Nawab Raisani to join his party. 
Mr Raisani was elected member of the Balochistan Assembly in the 2018 general election as an independent candidate. He was in the PPP and led the party’s coalition government in 2008 as the chief minister. 

Invites Aslam Raisani to join his party

In reply to a question about the Taliban government in Afghanistan, Maulana Fazl said he and his party had supported the Taliban and had relations with them. 
“The United States and Europe have reconciled with the Taliban despite declaring them terrorists,” he said, adding that the United States held talks with the Taliban and now there was a Taliban government in Afghanistan and they had come to Pakistan representing one country. 
In reply to a question about the PDM’s long march, he said the parties in the opposition alliance were in contact with each other reg­arding the march towards Islamabad. 
“Our preparations for the long march are continuing and the march will be organised according to the programme,” he added. 
He said PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif was in touch with the leaders of other parties in Punjab and Balochistan in connection with preparations for the march and the PDM still had two months till March 2022.
The JUI-F chief said he had asked Nawab Raisani to join his party and the former chief minister had sought one month’s time for consultations with his people, tribesmen and colleagues on the matter.

3,PPP urges ECP to probe delay in KP mayor poll results,Expresses concern over reports about missing presiding officers.,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) has expressed serious concern over reports about going missing of 14 presiding officers in Peshawar and asked the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to hold an investigation into the “unusual delay” in the compilation of results of the election held for the office of the city’s mayor. 
“The unusual delay from presiding officers of the polling stations demands an explanation that may be taken by the ECP. This unusual delay must be thoroughly investigated,” says a letter written to Chief Election Commis­sioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja on Monday by PPP Senator Taj Haider in his capacity as head of the party’s Central Election Cell. 
Through the letter, the PPP also requested the CEC to issue directives for the returning officer (RO) for mayor of Peshawar to “time stamp” the Form 17 results received after 4.30am (Monday) and “maintain a separate log of the remaining polling stations”. 
Earlier in the day, PPP’s information secretary Faisal Karim Kundi in a statement questioned the delay in the compilation of the results, stating that the delay in the results in the city like Peshawar had raised serious question marks on the exercise of holding the local government elections in the province. 

Concern expressed over reports about missing of presiding officers

Alleging that 14 presiding officers (POs) had not reached the RO office even on the second day, he said it seemed that the results of the elections were being altered through these POs. 
According to unofficial results, the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) suffered a major setback after its candidate Rizwan Bangash was defeated by Zubair Ali of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) in the contest for the post of Peshawar mayor.  
The unofficial results also show that opposition parties have a combined lead over the ruling PTI for the posts of mayor/chairman of the 63 tehsil councils of KP. 
The first phase of the local government polls held in KP on Sunday after a gap of six years witnessed widespread violence in various parts of the province, resulting in the death of five people and injuries to a number of others. 
The polling process in three tehsils — Swabi, Bannu and Darra Adamkhel — was postponed due to disturbances, including a suicide blast in Bajaur and abduction of polling staff in Bannu. 
PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had criticised the ruling PTI for the violence and mismanagement in the LG elections and accused it of making attempts to rig the elections. 
“The PTI has sunk to new depths in its attempts to rig local bodies’ elections. In DI Khan, an ANP candidate was assassinated a day before the polling, members of his family accused the PTI minister of first trying to bribe him then killing him,” tweeted the PPP chairman on his official Twitter handle. 

 



 
In Peshawar, the PPP chairman said, the PTI people were caught red handed stamping ballot papers the night before the polling. 
“All day, there have been reports of the PTI ransacking polling stations [and] attacking polling staff, including women,” said Mr Bhutto-Zardari. 
“This is what a desperately unpopular government looks like,” said the PPP chairman, asking the ECP to take action.

According to unofficial results, a total of 122 members of the provincial assembly cast their votes in the Senate election for one seat from the KP Assembly. Awami National Party and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl candidates got 13 votes each. Four votes were rejected. 
Mr Tarin became senator after Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s Mohammad Ayub Afridi resigned from the upper house of parliament. 
Talking to the media later, Senator Tarin expressed gratitude to the MPAs for electing him and asserted that the PTI would continue to serve the masses. He vowed that he would visit Peshawar every month, asserting that the government was taking pragmatic measures to provide relief to the common man, especially the poor segment of society. 
Referring to the price hike, the finance adviser said it was a global phenomenon as the coronavirus pandemic affected the economy of even developed countries across the world. However, he contended, the government was giving targeted subsidy to the masses under Ehsaas Rashan Card to provide respite from inflation.

5,IHC asks govt for its policy about missing persons’ cases,"Justice Aamer Farooq expresses displeasure at AAG, advises him to respect the court’s decorum.","ISLAMABAD: The Islam­abad High Court (IHC) on Monday asked the additio­nal attorney general (AAG) to take up the missing persons’ cases with the federal cabinet and inform the court about the government’s policy in this regard. 
An IHC division bench comprising Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb was hearing an intra-court appeal filed by the federal government against the order of the IHC single-member bench. 
Chief Justice Athar Minallah, while disposing of a petition filed by Mahera Sajid, spouse of missing IT engineer Sajid Mehmood, had directed the federal government to compensate the family of the missing person. 
The IHC division bench asked AAG Qasim Wadud the reason for filing the appeal against the order. 
Mr Wadud replied that the court had imposed a heavy fine on the federal government. He referred to a previous decision by the Supreme Court in which an amount of Rs2,000 had been imposed as a fine on the government in a similar case in 1999. 
Justice Aurangzeb reminded the AAG to read some judgements of Indian courts as imposing fine on the government was not an unusual phenomenon. 
Mr Wadud pointed out that the government had also filed an appeal in the Supreme Court. 
“Was the appeal filed to stop the IHC from proceeding in this case?” the court asked, adding that the government had delayed the filing of the appeal in the Supreme Court for over one and a half years. 
Mr Wadud requested the court to adjourn the case since he had forgotten to bring the case file in which he prepared the arguments. 
Justice Farooq expressed his displeasure and advised the AAG to respect the court’s decorum. 
Umer Gillani, the counsel for Mahera Sajid, told the court that spouse of his client had gone missing in 2015 and the stance of the federal government had remained the same in over 60 hearings. 
The court adjourned the hearing till next month.

6,US to show flexibility on Afghan financial sanctions: official,"US envoy, Iranian FM discuss Afghan situation with army chief.","ISLAMABAD: The United States would show greater flexibility on financial sanctions imposed on Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover to allow delivery of humanitarian aid to the war-ravaged country, a senior State Department official said on Monday.  
The official, who spoke to Islamabad-based journalists working with foreign media organisations, indicated that increased cash flow to Afghanistan would be allowed to put more liquidity in the country facing acute cash shortage. Similarly, more private remittances to Afghanistan would be allowed.  
The statement came amid growing calls for the US to review its punishing sanctions regime on the Afghan Taliban. 

US envoy, Iranian FM discuss Afghan situation with army chief

US sanctions and assets freeze following the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan have exacerbated the economic conditions in the country that was heavily reliant on donor assistance. The humanitarian crisis there resulting from drought and decades of conflict has been aggravated by the economic crunch.  
Foreign ministers of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) member countries, who met in Islamabad on Sunday to discuss the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan, had also called for easing of sanctions so that they “do not impede the provision of humanitarian aid or economic resources to preserve the institutions, schools and hospitals in Afghanistan and to allow multilateral development institutions, United Nations agencies, funds and programmes and other humanitarian organisations to channel existing assistance and assets towards humanitarian assistance”.  
The United Nations has flown about $152 million into Afghanistan in recent weeks. The money was then disbursed through an Afghan bank. This effort, facilitated by the US, is likely to be ramped up in weeks and months ahead.  
Taliban reportedly cooperated with this cash transfer as they did not attempt to grab the money.  
“We’ve worked quietly behind the scenes for cash to flow in larger and larger quantities inside the country. The Taliban are coordinating in this endeavor. They are not looking for cash and we are watching them very carefully,” the State Department official said. 
Moreover, Washington would soon issue more licences to allow personal remittances to flow to Afghanistan. So far three such licences have been issued by US authorities giving exemptions to financial institutions involved in transfer of non-commercial and personal remittances to Afghanistan from its sanctions regime.  
The official, however, emphasised that the US would want to have a monitoring mechanism in place to prevent the transferred money from being redirected to terrorist groups.  
The official ruled out a return to the normal, suggesting it was very complicated.  
He said immediate unfreezing of the $9.5 billion Afghan assets held by US authorities was not possible because it involved court cases. He said there was no “executive magic button” to get the money released.  
He called for increased regional and international support for Afghanistan to deal with the humanitarian crisis and hinted that the US may not be able to contribute in a big way. 
He said the US embassy would not reopen in near future in Kabul, but an engagement with technocrats in the government of Afghanistan would be started.     
US special envoy
US Special Representative for Afghanistan Thomas West met Army Chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa at the GHQ.  
“During the meeting, matters of mutual interest, current security situation in Afgha­nistan and bilateral cooperation opportunities in the context were discussed,” the ISPR said.
Gen Bajwa emphasised global convergence to avert a looming humanitarian catastrophe in Afghanistan. He said the world and the region could not afford an unstable Afghanistan.  
Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian also called on Gen Bajwa.  
“Geo-strategic environment particularly situation in Afghanistan, defence and security cooperation were discussed during the meeting. Pak-Iran border security mechanism also came under discussion,” the ISPR said.  
Mr Abdollahian was in Pakistan for attending the extraordinary session of the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers (CFM) on the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan.  
Gen Bajwa said that defence collaboration between Pakistan and Iran had strengthened over the years. 
The army chief described the CFM meeting as a historic development for addressing the dire humanitarian situation in Afghanistan and bringing the international community to a shared vision and joint strategy to find a solution to the emerging challenges in the region, which was vital for peace and stability.  
Mr Abdollahian acknowledged Pakistan’s contributions towards regional peace and the important role that Pakistan is playing in this regard.  
“Both sides agreed to stay engaged for enhanced bilateral cooperation while jointly working to assist in bringing positive developments in issues concerning the region, particularly efforts to mitigate challenges facing the people of Afghanistan,” the ISPR said.

9,Centre urged to give Rs50bn package for Balochistan growers,Provincial minister Mir Asadullah Baloch says those depicting Balochistan's negative image will never succeed in their intentions.,"QUETTA: Provincial Minister for Agriculture Mir Asadullah Baloch has urged the federal government to announce a package of at least Rs50 billion for the growers of Balochistan, adding that such help will bring an agricultural revolution in the province. 
Speaking at a function organised by the Balochistan Agriculture Officers Association on Monday, he said that through giving attention and resources, the province could be developed and through its vast land it could ensure food security for the country. 
The minister said that the future of the country depended on democracy. In the democratic process, the opinion of the people must be respected, he added. 
“Those who come by parachute cannot protect the interests of the country and the nation,” he said.  
The minister said that to make the country and the nation prosperous, they all must work together and think beyond ethnicity and religion. “The tragedy of our country is that despite the passage of 74 years, we are not one nation as we are still divided into Punjabi, Baloch, Pashtun and Sindhi nations,” he lamented. 
He said some responsibilities also lay with the “masterminds and strategists” for running the country but injustice continued till date and problems were arising due to lack of justice. 
He said that those depicting negative image of Balochistan at the national and international level would never succeed in their intentions. “We will promote the positive image of Balochistan before the world and that is why we have brought a change in Balochistan,” he said. 
Mr Baloch said Chief Minister Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo would formulate policies in the wider interest of the province and the people, which would develop the province and improve living standards of the people. 
“We consider our land as our mother and we should all love and cherish it. If this passion is in everyone’s heart, then the day is not far when Balochistan will be counted among the developed areas of the country,” said Mr Baloch said, who is also secretary general of Balochistan National Party-Awami.
