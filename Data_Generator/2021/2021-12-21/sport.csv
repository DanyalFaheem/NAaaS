0,New Zealand to tour Pakistan in two phases,LAHORE: New Zealand split its tour of Pakistan to play two Tests and three One-day Internationals in the first phase...,"LAHORE: New Zealand split its tour of Pakistan to play two Tests and three One-day Internationals in the first phase and then again come to play 10 white-ball matches, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) announced on Monday.
“New Zealand Cricket (NZC) has confirmed to tour  Pakistan for two Tests and three ODIs in December-January 2022-23 as part of the Future Tours Programme (FTP) and will return in April 2023 for 10 white-ball matches to make up for the September 2021 abandoned tour,” the PCB announced.
“The arrangement was finalised following meetings and discussions between the PCB and NZC chairpersons Mr Ramiz Raja and Mr Martin Snedden, respectively,” it added.
New Zealand had abandoned their tour in September citing a security  threat, a decision which came as a massive blow to Pakistan’s hopes of  staging regular international cricket and left the PCB disappointed.
The two Tests and three ODIs will be part of the ICC World Test Championship and ICC World Cup Super League, respectively, while the second visit will include two additional ODIs and will now comprise five ODIs and five T20Is that will count towards the ICC rankings.
“With details of the tours and matches now confirmed, the two boards will continue to work together to finalise the series dates, which will be announced in due course,” the PCB further said.
Ramiz welcomed the development.
“I am pleased with the outcomes of our discussions and negotiations, and thank Martin Snedden and his board for their understanding and support. This reflects the strong, cordial and historic relations the two boards have and reconfirms Pakistan’s status as an important member of the cricket fraternity.”
NZC chief executive David White said: “Our respective chairmen, Ramiz Raja and Martin Snedden, had very fruitful and constructive discussions while in Dubai, further strengthening the bond between the two organisations. It’s good to be going back.”
The latest announcement means Pakistan will host eight Tests, 11 ODIs and 13 T20Is against Australia, England and New Zealand  from March 2022 to April 2023.

1,SA-India series to be held behind closed doors,"The first of three Tests starts in Centurion on Sunday, they will be followed by three ODIs starting from Jan 19.","JOHANNESBURG: No tickets will be sold to the general public for the forthcoming Test and One-day International series between South Africa and India because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Cricket South Africa (CSA) announced on Monday.
CSA said in a statement that a joint decision had been taken with the Board of Control for Cricket in India to bar spectators from the grounds in order to prevent any possible breaches of the bio-secure environment in which the matches will be played. 
The first of three Tests starts in Centurion on Sunday. They will be followed by three One-day Internationals starting from Jan. 19. 
The statement cited the increasing number of Covid-19 cases around the world and the current fourth wave of infections in South Africa for the decision. 
“This decision was taken in order to avoid any breaches that could compromise the tour from a Covid-risk perspective and to also maintain a hazard-free bubble environment.” 
The statement added that the decision was made in the best interest of the game as well as the health and safety of players and staff. 
The statement did not mention whether there had been consultations with the South African government. Current regulations allow outdoor gatherings of 2000 people. 
South Africa, where the highly mutated Omicron variant was first detected last month, is Africa’s worst-hit country according to official tallies of virus cases, with more than 3.3 million infections logged and more than 90,000 deaths. 
CSA Acting chief executive Pholetsi Moseki said: “This decision was not taken lightly but was instead taken in the best interest of the game and in the interest of the health and safety of all patrons.” 
CSA informed media outlets last week that limited access to the grounds will be granted to fully-vaccinated journalists. 
The matches will be broadcast on both subscription and free-to-air television channels. 
Earlier on Monday, CSA announced that a Mzansi Super League Twenty20 tournament, planned for February, had been cancelled due to increased travel restrictions caused by the coronavirus pandemic. 
The tournament, originally planned as South Africa’s equivalent of the Indian Premier League and Australia’s Big Bash League, was also cancelled because of Covid last season after only two editions.

2,England greats rue second straight defeat in Australia,LONDON: England’s heavy 275-run loss to Australia in the second Ashes Test on Monday had former players ...,"LONDON: England’s heavy 275-run loss to Australia in the second Ashes Test on Monday had former players questioning not only the tourists’ team selection in Adelaide but also their batting abilities.
Australia went 2-0 up in the five-match series and Monday marked 4,000 days since England had won an Ashes test Down Under, their last victory coming in the 2010-11 series.
England rested spinner Jack Leach and, on a track where his Australian counterpart Nathan Lyon picked up five wickets, skipper Joe Root ended up bowling 26 overs himself while fast bowler Ollie Robinson also switched to off-spin.
“Robinson bowling off spin, Lyon ripping it square and England’s spinners sat on the bench. You couldn’t make it up, really,” former England captain Mike Atherton wrote in The Times.
“The margin of defeat was a mighty one, and the fighting spirit on the last afternoon should not camouflage the fact that England, for the second time in as many tests, have been out-thought and outplayed.
“Once again the batting has been completely underwhelming and they face a returning and refreshed Pat Cummins next as Australia announced an unchanged squad for the Boxing Day test. Root’s Ashes dreams hang by a thread.”
Chris Woakes’ selection was also criticised after he picked up only one wicket for 149 runs in the match, with Geoffrey Boycott saying the runs he added in the middle order did not offset his  “lack of wicket-taking ability abroad”.
“England keep selecting Chris Woakes for his late order runs to help out their fragile batting. Did his runs in Adelaide affect the winning or losing of the test? No,” Boycott wrote in The Telegraph.
“If he was trying to hit the middle of the Aussie bats then he succeeded... We need to pick bowlers to take 20 wickets and our batsmen have to do better.”
Root set a record with his 23rd defeat as England captain in 58 Tests.
But even as he sits 158 runs behind former Pakistan batsman Mohammad Yousuf’s record for most runs in a calendar year (1788), the verdict is his batting lineup let him down once again, especially openers Rory Burns and Haseeb Hameed.
“The two openers are walking wickets and the Aussie bowlers are queuing up to get at them,” Boycott added.
“It’s not ideal but Joe Root at some stage may have to bat (at number) three... England have to do something different because they are not scoring enough runs to put Australia under any sort of scoreboard pressure.”

3,"Biennial World Cup would raise extra $4.4 billion, FIFA delegates told",FIFA is holding a ‘global summit’ to discuss their proposal to increase the World Cup's frequency from four years to every two.,"ZURICH: International football leaders were told by FIFA on Monday that a switch to a biennial World Cup would create an extra $4.4 billion in revenues for the world body.
FIFA is holding a ‘global summit’ of leaders of national football federations to discuss their proposal to increase the frequency of the World Cup from every four years to every two.
The financial data forms part of an overall feasibility study which FIFA is presenting on Monday. No vote is planned from the event which forms part of FIFA’s consultation process.
The upbeat reports are in marked contrast to analysis put forward by critics of the proposals.
There has been opposition from European clubs, the top leagues and European governing body UEFA whose president Aleksander Ceferin has threatened to boycott any additional tournament.
Last month, a report commissioned by the World Leagues Forum said the FIFA proposal, allied with changes to the Club World Cup could cost the big domestic leagues and UEFA around 8 billion euros ($9 billion) per season in lost TV rights and match day and commercial agreements.
UEFA, on Friday, published a report they had commissioned from consultancy firm Oliver & Ohlbaum which warned that said the changes to the international calendar would impact see revenues for European national federations drop between 2.5 and 3 billion euros ($3.38 billion) over a four year cycle.
The delegates to Monday’s summit were told that a report by Italian company Open Economics had found that domestic leagues and UEFA competitions do not have their revenues hurt by national team and international club competition.
The report said that revenue of national leagues had increased in years when a major international tournament was held.
Professor Pasquale Lucio Scandizzo, of OpenEconomics told the delegates that the plan  “promises significant and positive net macroeconomic benefits, distributed over time and space”.
A report from Nielsen predicted that the plan would see revenues rise from an expected $7 billion — for a 48 tournament — to $11.4 billion over a four year cycle thanks to increased ticket receipts and media rights and sponsorship revenues.
FIFA officials told the delegates that $3.5 billion of the extra revenue would go to a new ‘Member Association Solidarity Fund’ with each national federation allocated around $16 million in a four year period, while extra funds would also be given to the FIFA Forward Program for development projects.
FIFA said that the funds would help reduce the gap in revenues between the developed and less developed football markets.
Any vote on the plans would likely involve all the 211 national associations.
Along with UEFA, South American confederation CONMEBOL has opposed the proposal.
Earlier this month, Victor Montagliani, president of North and Central American and Caribbean confederation CONCACAF, said that a compromise solution could be for an additional tournament to be a revamped version of the old Confederations Cup rather than a full World Cup with a separate qualifying process.

6,Premier League set to plough through festive schedule,LONDON: Premier League clubs have agreed to continue playing games scheduled over the festive period despite a surge...,"LONDON: Premier League clubs have agreed to continue playing games scheduled over the festive period despite a surge in Covid-19 cases postponing several fixtures, according to reports on Monday. 
Ten Premier League games have been postponed this month due to outbreaks amid a busy schedule where teams are set to play three times between Boxing Day and Jan 3.
Only four of the 10 weekend’s fixtures were played after teams told the Premier League they were unable to name a full strength side. 
The Premier League board has been considering applications for postponements on a case-by-case basis but there has been criticism over the decision-making process, with fears it jeopardises the sporting integrity of the competition. 
But clubs were told at a meeting on Monday that no postponements would be permitted if 13 outfield players and one goalkeeper from their 25-man squad list were available. 
Clubs will be expected to play games so long as they have 13 outfield players and a goalkeeper, the BBC said. 
The Premier League did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
There could be some adjustment of the schedule for Cup games, though, with talks between clubs and authorities to scrap FA Cup replays in rounds three and four, and to reduce League Cup semi-final ties to one-leg matches, the report added.

Mike Core beat the offside trap and slipped the ball through the legs of Marseille goalkeeper Steve Mandanda to give Cannet-Rocheville a surprise lead at the Velodrome. But they were reduced to 10 men before half-time as Milik levelled from the penalty spot. 
Milik struck again on 57 minutes and completed his treble in stoppage time after Luis Henrique added a third for Marseille, who were dumped out by fourth-division opponents in last season’s competition. 
PSG, who have lifted the trophy in six of the past seven years, strolled into the last 32 with a no-nonsense 3-0 win at Feignies Aulnoye in Valenciennes. 
Kylian Mbappe and Mauro Icardi both netted first-half penalties before the France forward completed a double in the second half as the Ligue 1 leaders eased past a team playing in the French fifth tier. 
Angers crashed out with a 2-0 defeat at fifth division side Linas Montlhery, who prevailed thanks to a Pascal Leno first-half double. 
Fourth division team Bergerac Perigord also sent a top-flight side packing when they eliminated Metz 5-4 on penalties after a goalless draw.  
Wissam Ben Yedder grabbed both goals as Monaco beat third-tier Red Star 2-0, while RC Lens defeated amateurs Stade Poitevin 1-0. 
Pascal Dupraz won his first game in charge of Ligue 1 strugglers St-Etienne, who edged past Lyon-La Duchere of the fourth tier 1-0.

8,Rafael Nadal tests positive for Covid in latest blow for legend,The champion has struggled with a foot injury for the past six months — forcing him to miss both Wimbledon and the US Open.,"MADRID: Spanish tennis star Rafael Nadal said on Monday he had tested positive for Covid-19, which puts in doubt his participation in the Australian Open next month where he was expected to make his big comeback after months of injury.
The Spanish former world number one said he took the test when he returned to Spain from Abu Dhabi where he took part in an exhibition tournament last week, his first since August due to a foot injury.
“I am going through some unpleasant moments but I trust that I will improve little by little. I am now confined at home and have informed the people who had been in contact with me,” he wrote on Twitter.
“As a consequence of the situation, I have to have total flexibility with my calendar and I will analyse my options depending on my evolution. I will keep you informed of any decisions about my future tournaments.”
The 35-year-old had been due to fly to Melbourne later this month to compete in an ATP event ahead of the Australian Open which begins at Melbourne Park on Jan 17.
The 20-time major champion has struggled with a foot injury for the past six months — forcing him to miss both Wimbledon and the US Open.
Nadal lost to another former world number one Andy Murray in an exhibition match on Friday in Abu Dhabi, his first match since August. He then lost to Wimbledon semi-finalist Denis Shapovalov of Canada on Saturday.
It was his first tournament appearance since the Citi Open in Washington in early August where he lost to Lloyd Harris. 
Nadal had said the championship in Abu Dhabi was a chance to test his foot and work towards the trip Down Under in healthy conditions. “I was able to compete in both matches and even had my chances, so if we put that in perspective it’s a very positive thing,” he said after the tournament in Abu Dhabi.
“The idea is to go there and try my best there in Australia. Being 100 per cent honest, I can’t guarantee it,” he added, saying he would have to speak to his team before making a final decision.

Eljif Elmas headed home the decisive goal from Piotr Zielinski’s fifth-minute corner and Milan had an equaliser controversially disallowed right at the death. Franck Kessie’s goal was ruled out on video review as Olivier Giroud was in an offside position that was judged to be interfering with play, despite the Rossoneri forward being prone on the ground, underneath a Napoli defender. 
“In the end they will say that they applied the rules in the right way ... but I say: ‘How can a player who is on the ground interfere with the defence?” Milan coach Stefano Pioli said. “We’re disappointed, we’re disappointed to have lost this match. Now we’ll lick our wounds and then we’ll go again.” 
Pioli’s side have been bumped down to third following that controversial ending but are level on 39 points with Napoli. The two teams are four points behind defending champions Inter Milan, who are winter champions with a match to spare. 
The result will also serve as a confidence boost for Napoli, who had lost back-to-back league matches and had won just one of their last six games in the league. 
“We should be really proud of this win. We showed real personality and we made Milan really suffer, which is a big deal,” Napoli midfielder Zieliski said. “We’re up near the top fighting hard and we won’t give up. We’ll fight until the bitter end to win the title.” 
Dusan Vlahovic was again on target for Fiorentina in Sunday’s early match but could not help the Viola put pressure on Serie A’s Champions League positions. 
Serbia forward Vlahovic struck his league-leading 16th goal of the season in the 51st minute in Florence to pull a goal back after his team trailed by two at half-time. 
Lucas Torreira levelled just after the hour mark but Vincenzo Italiano’s side then lost Cristiano Biraghi to a second yellow card in the 68th minute and could not complete a comeback which would have put them within three points of the top four. 
Fiorentina sit sixth, level on 31 points with AS Roma and Juventus and six points behind fourth-placed Atalanta. 
Torino moved up to 10th after beating 10-man Verona 1-0 with Tommaso Pobega’s strike midway through the first half, while Thomas Henry snatched a late point for Venezia in a 1-1 draw at Sampdoria after Spezia and Empoli also played out a 1-1 stalemate earlier in the day.

12,Australia ace second Ashes Test despite Buttler resistance,"Marnus Labus­chagne was adjudged man-of-the-match for his 103, the only century hit by a player from either side in the match.","ADELAIDE: Jos Buttler’s dogged resistance ended in a bizarre fashion as Australia thrashed England by 275 runs in the day-night second Test to go 2-0 up in the five-match Ashes series on Monday. 
England resumed the final day on a precarious 82-4, needing 386 more runs for an improbable win or to at least bat out the last three sessions to force a draw. 
They lost talismanic Ben Stokes in the first session and Chris Woakes fell after a fighting 44, which was the highest individual score in England’s abject second innings batting display. 
Buttler, who had a wretched time behind the wicket, dropping several catches, then produced a spectacular rearguard, spread over 207 deliveries, for an uncharacteristically dogged 26 that kept alive England’s faint hopes of saving the match. 
It was soon snuffed out when the batsman, retreating deep into the crease to work a Jhye Richardson delivery on the off-side, trod on his own stumps. 
For Australia, Richardson claimed 5-42 in a magnificent display of pace bowling. 
“They showed some great resilience today,” Australia’s stand-in captain Steve Smith said of their opponents. “Jos played a really good innings, he faced over 200 balls. We were trying to stay as calm as we could out in the middle and just thought, a couple of good balls and a couple of wickets and we’ll keep going.” 
Australia’s Marnus Labus­chagne was adjudged man-of-the-match for his 103, the only century hit by a player from either side in the match. 
Australia were without regular captain Pat Cummins, who missed out for being a close contact of a positive Covid-19 case, and injured paceman Josh Hazlewood. 
“We made mistakes throughout the game that we made last week, whether it be no-balls, missed chances,” England captain Joe Root said.  
“The reason it’s disappointing is because we made the same mistakes. I think we could have bowled a lot fuller, and with the bat we need to be better, make bigger scores and apply better. We just have to be better. We have to learn those lessons very quickly over the next week.” 
Australia began with their senior bowlers, Mitchell Starc and Nathan Lyon, who have thrived in this Test in the absence of Cummins and Hazlewood. 
Ollie Pope lasted seven balls, a boundary through midwicket his sole contribution, before he nicked Starc to Smith in the slips. 
Smacking his bat against his foot as he walked off, Pope has had a poor tour to date and will be worried about his place for the third test. 
Stokes was England’s last major hope of salvaging a draw and his batting was restrained, a sweep to the boundary off Lyon in the 55th over a highlight. 
A few minutes later though, Lyon delivered a ball that replays showed to be hitting leg stump and Stokes was gone lbw for 12 runs in 110 minutes. 
Buttler smacked Richardson through point for four runs off the quick’s second delivery but England highlights were otherwise sparse. 
While Buttler’s obdurate batting took England’s fight to the final session, the miracle they needed to save the match did not materialise. 
“That’s the attitude we have to harness through the whole game,” Root said. “The fight and attitude was great today and we just have to do more of it.” 
Only one team has come from 2-0 down to win an Ashes series: Don Bradmans Australians in 1936-37. As holders of the Ashes, Australia needs only to draw the next match. 
The third Test begins in Melbo­urne on Sunday and Australia have named an unchanged 15-man squad for the remaining three Ashes Tests. 
Hazlewood will need to prove his fitness in the Melbourne Cricket Ground nets to play the Boxing Day Test. The fourth and fifth Tests in Sydney and Hobart, respectively, are in January.

Jorge Molina struck three times in Granada’s 4-1 win over Mallorca to become the oldest player at 39 years and 241 days to score a hat-trick in the top five European leagues.
The stalemate against Cadiz leaves Real six points clear at the top. It came a day after second-placed Sevilla cut into their lead by beating defending champion Atletico Madrid 2-1.
Carlo Ancelotti was without Luka Modric, Rodrygo, Marco Asensio, Gareth Bale, Marcelo, and back-up goalkeeper Andriy Lunin because of a Covid-19 outbreak. Modric’s place in the starting 11 is unquestioned while forwards Rodrygo and Asensio share time in Ancelotti’s rotation. Bale and Marcelo, once stars, are rarely-used substitutes.
Cadiz, struggling in the relegation zone, frustrated Real by aligning nine players in two tight lines in front of their area. When Real did manage to work its way through, goalkeeper Jeremas Ledesma was there to save the visitors.
Real went no closer than Federico Valverde’s long-range strike which was parried by Ledesma midway through the first half. Ledesma also did well to block Karim Benzema’s late free kick.
“When you play against a team that shuts up shop, you need forwards who can go after crosses. And we don’t have players like that,” Ancelotti said. “I am not saying I don’t want Benzema on my team, I always do of course, but he is not that type of player.”
The virus outbreak gave Eden Hazard a rare chance to play a complete match for Madrid.
The Belgium forward, who cost Madrid 100 million euros in 2019, hadn’t started a match since September, when he was part of the lineup that was embarrassed 2-1 at home by Moldovan side Sheriff in the Champions League.
Molina is the oldest player to score a league hat trick in the top tiers of Spain, England, Germany, Italy and France, according to Opta.
The striker didn’t debut in the first division until he was 29, but he then played long stints with Real Betis and Getafe before joining Granada last season.
Inaki Williams scored a brace and Oscar de Marcos struck the 90th-minute winner to lead Athletic Bilbao to a 3-2 victory over Betis, ending an eight-round winless streak for the Basque club.
Betis, who remained in third place, got goals from Nabil Fekir and Juanmi Jiminez, whose 11 goals are only second to Benzema’s 13 in the league.
Daro Poveda headed home Damian Suarez’s cross in stoppage time to snatch Getafe a 1-0 win over Osasuna that lifted them out of the relegation zone.

The stalemate meant Liverpool slipped three points behind leaders Manchester City after having defender Andrew Robertson sent off and being infuriated that Spurs striker Harry Kane didn’t also see red. 
“I have no problems with any referees, only you,” Juergen Klopp bellowed to referee Paul Tierney after the final whistle. 
Liverpool had already conceded for the final time — Son Heung-min’s equaliser in the 74th minute when Robertson was dismissed for a wild kick on Emerson Royal three minutes later. 
But Robertson’s exit brought into sharper focus Kane staying on the pitch in the first half for a lunge on Robertson. 
Kane had already put Tottenham in front after latching onto Tanguy Ndombele’s through ball for only the striker’s second league goal of the season in his 15th game. 
“We can give Robbo a red card, it’s not the smartest challenge of his life, but that [from Kane] is definitely a red card,” Klopp said. “People will say his leg is in the air, but it’s pure coincidence. Harry cannot judge that, if Robbo’s leg is on the ground it’s a broken leg.”
Liverpool did go in front, with Diogo Jota heading in the equaliser in the 35th and Robertson nodding in from close range in the 69th. 
But Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker missed an attempt to clear Harry Winks long ball, giving Son the opportunity to seize possession and slot into an empty net. 
“It was an exciting game and we created many, many chances,” Tottenham manager Antonio Conte said. “We have to be a bit disappointed with the draw. We played against a really strong team, this team is amazing and they are working for many years.” 
But Liverpool are losing ground on City in their bid to regain the trophy.
