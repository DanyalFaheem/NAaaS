0,CII for improving judicial system to stop Sialkot-like incident,Declaration issued calls for punishing all those found guilty of involvement in the tragedy after a thorough legal process.,"ISLAMABAD: The Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) on Monday noted that a serious issue facing the country was implementation of laws and that the judicial system needed improvements to stop a recurrence of the Sialkot-like incident.  
The CII observed that taking the law into one’s own hands was against Quran and Sunnah, Sharia and the Constitution. It said if a person took the law into his own hands, the state should take immediate action against him.  
The CII held a special meeting, calling it a brainstorming session over the Sialkot lynching incident in which Sri Lankan factory manager Priyantha Kumara was tortured to death and his body set on fire by a mob over allegations of blasphemy.  
The meeting was briefed by District Police Officer Omar Saeed Malik on the action taken after the tragedy and the current status of the case.  
The CII members noted that there was room for improvement in the country’s judicial system.  
“Legislation is needed to prevent such incidents. Those responsible for the Sialkot tragedy should be punished,” CII chairman Dr Qibla Ayaz said while talking to the media after the meeting. He said the purpose of the session was to determine and understand the causes and factors behind the tragedy.  
“But we all understand that despite all shortcomings in the system it’s the responsibility of the state, as well as the citizens, to end the rising incidence of violence,” he added.  
The meeting was attended by experts in psychology, sociology and law, besides police officers.  
Allama Tahir Ashrafi, a member of the CII, said the state was very clear that another Sialkot-like incident would not be tolerated. “But at the same time we all need to understand that it will take time to get rid of the disease that has taken 40 years to mature,” he added.  
A declaration issued by the CII called for  punishing all those found guilty of involvement in the Sialkot tragedy after a thorough legal process.  
The meeting decided to continue the consultation process with experts to eradicate extremism from the country.  
The declaration said the council had previously stated that the problem was non-enforcement of the law and that ensuring punishment for those involved in such incidents under the existing laws was more important than formulating new laws. The system should ensure that those involved in the Sialkot tragedy or any other such incidents are punished.  
At the same time, the CII was of the opinion that the growing violence in the country was also due to the presence and dissemination of anti-Islam and anti-Pakistan content on social media. The council said it was working with other agencies in this regard as a coordinated strategy was required to counter it.  
The CII stated that there was room for substantial reform in the existing judicial system in such a way as to restore public confidence in these institutions. It said there was an urgent need for creating awareness among the masses against the tendency of taking the law into their own hands.  
The council suggested to the government to take steps to table the Paigham-i-Pakistan declaration in parliament for approval. 
The 2017 unanimous declaration termed terrorism, suicide attacks and killing someone haram in Islam. It was endorsed by all schools of thought and madressah boards in the country.  
The CII meeting praised the government for its handling of the situation after the Sialkot incident to the satisfaction of the government and people of Sri Lanka. 
The meeting welcomed the decision by Prime Minister Imran Khan to award Certificate of Merit and Medal of Courage to Malik Adnan, who tried to save his Sri Lankan colleague from the mob.

He highlighted the importance of regional connectivity and economic integration, suggesting both the countries join hands for the same.
The 1,800-kilometre pipeline is expected to carry 33 billion cubic metres of natural gas every year from Turkmenistan’s Galkynysh, the world’s second-largest gas field, to the Indian city of Fazilka. It will pass through Herat and Kandahar, in Afghanistan, and Quetta and Multan. 
There are two phases of the project: a free flow phase with an estimated cost of $5-6bn and installation of compressor stations for at least $1.9bn.
In his meeting with the Turkmen foreign minister, President Alvi congratulated the visiting dignitary on the successful holding of the 17th extraordinary session of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.
He hoped the session would succeed in getting the international support required to address the crisis in Afghanistan. He urged the international community to realise the gravity of the situation and support the disaster-stricken country in this hour of need.  
The president underlined that Afghanistan should not be further squeezed and the blocked money released to counter the worsening economic and humanitarian crises. 
He recalled his recent visit to Turkmenistan and said he had held very “fruitful” meetings with his Turkmen counterpart and both sides emphasised the need for early completion of the Tapi gas pipeline project.  
Speaking on the occasion, the Turkmen foreign minister conveyed to the president warmest wishes from President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow.  
He said the visit of President Alvi to Turkmenistan was a great support for them that would further boost cooperation between the two brotherly countries.

2,Afghan FM sees positive outcome of OIC session,Disapproves of Karzai’s rant against Imran’s remarks,"KARACHI: While terming the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation’s (OIC) session ‘positive’ with ‘positive outcomes’, Afghanistan’s acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi said on Monday all participants at the conference spoke in favour of Afghanistan. 
Mr Muttaqi, who had addressed the OIC session on Afghanistan, upon returning to Kabul from Islamabad disapproved of ex-president Hamid Karzai’s statement rebuking Prime Minister Imran Khan for attributing the prevalent Afghan situation to years of ‘corruption’ by past governments, according to Dawn.com. 
The prime minister had made the remarks while addressing the 17th extraordinary session of the OIC’s Council of Foreign Ministers in Islamabad on Sunday. He also said that Pakistan faced the threat of the militant Islamic State (IS) group from Afghanistan’s soil. 

Disapproves of Karzai’s rant against Imran’s remarks 

Reacting to the premier’s remarks, Mr Karzai described the statements as “an attempt to sow discord among Afghans, and an insult to the Afghan people”. He tweeted that the government of Pakistan should “strictly refrain from propagating against Afghanistan and interfering in our internal affairs”. He stated Pakistan should avoid speaking on behalf of Afghanistan on international forums and instead work for creating “civilised relations” between the two countries. 
About Mr Khan’s concern over the IS threat originating from Afghan soil, Mr Karzai called it a part of ‘clear propaganda’, stating “the reality has been the opposite”. “The threat of IS has been directed from Pakistan against Afghanistan from the very outset,” he added. 
Talking to reporters in Kabul, the Afghan foreign minister disapproved of Karzai’s statement and declared that he did not find anything “insulting” about Prime Minister Imran Khan’s remarks. “I do not see anything insulting about Imran Khan’s remarks that needs an official response. It was a positive conference and there are positive outcomes so we should not take it negatively,” Mr Muttaqi added. 
“What’s of significance is that Imran Khan slammed former Afghan governments,” he said, adding that he believed “officials from the past governments were compelled to show some reaction”.  
About the OIC session, he said different views and opinions were shared and every person was responsible for what they said. “[But more] importantly, all participants at the conference spoke in favour of Afghanistan.” 
Muttaqi’s remarks were posted on the official Facebook page of Afghanistan’s state media.
