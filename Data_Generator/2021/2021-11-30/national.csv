0,Pakistan offers to host OIC meeting on Afghan issue,Saudi Arabia calls for foreign ministers-level session,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Monday of­­fered to host next month a meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) foreign ministers on Afghanistan that had been requisitioned by Saudi Arabia.
“We have also offered to host the meeting, in Islamabad, on 17 December 2021. We are confident that OIC member states will endorse this offer,” said Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi. 
Saudi Arabia has convened the meeting for discussing the aggravating humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan.
“Guided by principles of Islamic solidarity with the people of Afghanistan, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as Chair of the Islamic Summit, and in line with relevant OIC decisions on Afghanistan, called upon the OIC to, urgently, convene an Extra­ordinary Ministerial Meeting to discuss the humanitarian situation in the country and pathways for an urgent humanitarian response,” Saudi Arabia said in a statement published by its official newswire SPA.
Mr Qureshi said that Pakistan fully endorsed the Saudi initiative.

Saudi Arabia calls for foreign ministers-level session

Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, noted Pakistan’s offer to host the meeting.
It said that objectives of the meeting were to explore “means and mechanisms” for aid delivery in coordination with UN agencies, international financial institutions, and the international community for mitigating the humanitarian crisis.
UN envoy for Afghanistan Deborah Lyons had on November 18 warned that Afghanistan was “on the brink of a humanitarian catastrophe” and urged the international community to assist the people of Afghanistan. 
It is estimated that nearly 60 per cent of Afghanistan’s 38 million population was facing extreme hunger.
“Millions of Afghan women, children, and elderly people are in need of immediate assistance, including access to food, medicine and shelter,” Saudi Arabia said while emphasising the seriousness of the situation. 
“Impending economic collapse and further deterioration of living conditions will lead to more instability within Afghanistan, which will adversely affect regional and international peace and security,” the kingdom warned. 
Backing the Saudi call, Mr Qureshi said the Afghans needed assistance “more than ever before”. 
“As you are aware, Afghanistan currently faces a serious humanitarian situation — millions of Afghans, including women and children, confront an uncertain future due to shortage of food, medicine and other essential life supplies. The advent of winter has exacerbated the humanitarian crisis,” he added. 
The foreign minister urged the OIC to step in to help Afghans. “We should step up our collective efforts to alleviate the humanitarian needs of the Afghan people, provide immediate and sustained support to them, and continue to remain engaged with them for the well-being and prosperity of Afghanistan,” he said. 
Mr Qureshi expressed the hope that the OIC foreign ministers would consider concrete steps to help address the humanitarian and economic challenges being faced by Afghanistan.

1,"Women, children pour into Gwadar’s streets to demand rights",Leader regrets protesters have been termed “Indian agents” just because they are fighting for their rights.,"GWADAR: A large number of women along with their children took to the streets of the port city on Monday in solidarity with the movement launched for the rights of the people of Gwadar and other areas of Makran. 
The demonstrators, including female students, political workers and working women who reached Gwadar city from Turbat, Ormara, Jewani, Pasni and other areas of Gwadar district, started their rally from Al-Johar Public School and after marching on various roads and streets reached Marine Drive.  
They kept chanting slogans against the provincial government and in support of their demands, with most of them carrying placards and banners inscribed with “Gwadar ko haq do” (Give rights to Gwadar). 
Secretary General of Jamaat-i-Islami’s (JI) Balochistan chapter Maulana Hidayatur Rehman Baloch, who has been leading the sit-in in Gwadar for the last two weeks, welcomed the women activists and stressed that such a big rally of women was proof that every person was now willing to join the movement for their rights.  
“The people of Gwadar have been deceived in the name of CPEC [China-Pakistan Economic Corridor] and Gwadar port while they have not benefited from it,” he said.  
He lamented that fishermen had been deprived of earning their livelihood, a ban was imposed on border trade and people were not getting health, education, water supply and other basic amenities. 
Maulana Baloch asserted that drug mafia was running drugs and liquor business with the connivance of the local administration due to which the youth were becoming drug addicts and the provincial government was doing nothing to abolish liquor shops and act against the drugs business.  
He said that although the government had issued a notification in this regard, its powerful institutions refused to accept the orders. 
He regretted that the protesters had been termed “Indian agents” just because they are fighting for their rights. “We are agents of our people and not the agents of an enemy country,” he said, adding that instead of punishing an Indian agent who was arrested from Balochistan, the government was making legislation for his release. 
The people, including women and children, would not step back from their demands, and the protesters would start blocking the coastal highway and other roads in the coming days, Maulana Baloch declared.  
“If CPEC and Gwadar port are not for the prosperity of the local people, then they do not need to be here,” he added. He appreciated the protest by transport companies supplying construction material to the Chinese companies and said that it was a slap on the face of those who were talking about the development of Gwadar. 
Leaders of JI’s women wing in Gwadar, including Fatima Sumera Siddique, Zoya Baloch, Nafisa Rasheed and Zeenat Allah Bakhsh, also spoke on the occasion.

2,Supreme Court to take up PTM leader Ali Wazir’s bail plea today,"Petition says SHC and ATC ""failed to appreciate that witnesses named in the FIR were not independent witnesses"".","ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court bench, which had transferred the bail plea of Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM) leader Mohammad Ali Wazir to another bench, will now hear the same appeal on Tuesday (today). 
Justice Sardar Tariq Masood, who headed the three-judge bench which ordered the transfer, observed on Monday that the case was inadvertently fixed for hearing before a different bench. 
Under the previous schedule, the appeal was due for hearing by a bench headed by Justice Umar Ata Bandial on Monday. 
A notice issued by the Supreme Court office stated that the case fixed before the three-judge bench under Justice Bandial had been delisted because Justice Sajjad Ali Shah, a member of the bench, was not available for hearing.
Mohsin Dawar, another PTM leader and member of the National Assembly, appeared before the bench of Justice Sardar Tariq Masood on Monday and was told that the case was fixed before a different bench by mistake. 
Mohsin Dawar told the judge that Salahuddin Khan Gandapur, the counsel for Ali Wazir, was out of Islamabad too. The hearing was adjourned to Tuesday on the PTM chief’s request.
Ali Wazir, an MNA, was arrested on charges of making incendiary speeches against state institutions at a public meeting in Karachi on December 6 last year. The first information report (FIR) against him was lodged at Sohrab Goth police station the same day.
The MNA pleaded with the apex court to set aside the Sindh High Court order since it was not sustainable under the law, adding that he was innocent and did not commit the offence mentioned in the FIR.
Furthermore, the petitioner argued, the SHC and the Anti- Terrorism Court (ATC) “failed to appreciate that witnesses named in the FIR were not independent witnesses. They were police personnel and therefore interested witnesses”.
The petition recalled that the FIR did not name any independent witness from the area where the public meeting was held. “It won’t be wrong to assume that the petitioner (Ali Wazir) has been implicated in a false case.” 
The petitioner stated further that he had no criminal history and no cases were pending against him. There was no independent evidence to connect the appellant with the alleged offences of criminal conspiracy, waging war against the state, assaulting the president, the governor, promoting enmity between linguistic groups and spreading rumours with the intent to incite mutiny.

4,Mohammad Ziauddin — a fiercely independent journalist,He was among the last of titans in journalism and newspapering world.,"ISLAMABAD: Ziauddin was among the last of titans in journalism and newspapering world.  
These were the words uttered by Farhatullah Babar, who is known as human rights activist more than his position as the PPP secretary general, after attending the funeral of veteran journalist Muhammad Ziauddin, who passed away early Monday morning after a brief illness. He was 83.  
“The trophies he won as a professional journalist were vastly different and immeasurably superior to the glittering medals worn on the chests. The trophies that came his way without his seeking indeed are intangible. Unlike the medals worn on chests, they never gather dust,” remarked Mr Babar, who also has a journalistic background, while recalling a number of instances when Ziauddin flatly refused to get any favour from those in power throughout his “illustrious career” spanning nearly 60 years.  
The most befitting description of late Ziauddin’s professionalism came from Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry who declared him as “the most capable and fiercely independent journalist” he had ever encountered.  
Every ruler wanted to see Ziauddin in the interview panel only to provide some legitimacy and credibility to his or her actions, but at the end, they found themselves in deep trouble and fully exposed before the nation.  
During the second tenure of Benazir Bhutto in 1994, once Ziauddin Sb and Ghazi Salahuddin reluctantly interviewed Asif Ali Zardari for state-run PTV and blatantly asked questions about the stories of his corruption. The interview was never telecast.  
The journalists around the world still remember the incident when then military dictator Gen Pervez Musharraf during a talk at a think tank in London in 2007 got annoyed with Ziauddin, who was working as Dawn correspondent in the UK after getting retirement as resident editor of the daily, over a question about the safety of the country’s nuclear assets and publicly called him a traitor.  
In his recent interview to senior journalist Kamal Siddiqui published on the Samaa TV website, Ziauddin narrated the whole incident as to how later, while addressing the Pakistani community, Gen Musharraf recalled his altercation with him and instructed the audience ‘do-teen tika dain’ (slug him a few) if they saw him. 
The next day all the major newspapers pegged their stories on the Ziauddin-Musharraf spat except Dawn because: “We are journalists and we do not become the story,” Mr Siddiqui quoted Ziauddin Sb as having stated.  
Born in Indian city of Madras (now Chenai) in 1938, Muhammad Ziauddin had migrated to Dhaka, the then East Pakistan, with his family in 1952. He had obtained a bachelor degree in pharmacy from Dhaka University before moving to Karachi in 1960 where he did masters in journalism from Karachi University. He started his journalistic career as a junior reporter in Pakistan Press Agency (which later became Pakistan Press International) in 1966.  
In 1974, Ziauddin joined weekly Pakistan Economist and started doing reports on the subjects of finance and economy. In 1976, he became assistant editor of Morning News. However, he moved to Islamabad in 1978 and joined The Muslim as a member of the founding team of the newspaper.  
Ziauddin had the longest association with Dawn, which he had joined as an economy reporter in 1982. And the very next year, he got APNS Award in the category of best investigative story for his report captioned “The untold story of IMF conditions” in which he had exposed the tough conditions attached with the IMF programme for the first time.  
Through his hard work, he became the bureau chief of Dawn’s Islamabad office in 1990, a position he held till March 2001, when he became the first resident editor of the newspaper after the launching of its edition from the capital. It was after him becoming the resident editor that the newspaper came out with special Economic and Business Review pages, known as EBR, which were later turned into Business and Finance.  
Ziauddin, who is known as one of the pioneers in finance reporting, had also joined The News in 1994 but left the organisation within months and rejoined Dawn after developing some differences with the management and due to interference from the top in editorial matters. He worked as resident editor of Dawn Islamabad till 2005 and then moved to London to work as its foreign correspondent. He, however, returned to the country, mostly because of unsuitable weather conditions for him as he was a heart patient with asthma.  
Ziauddin also worked as executive editor of Express Tribune from 2009 to 2014. 
He was very pro-worker and also known as a trade unionist. He also held the office of assistant secretary general of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) in the 1970s. Despite holding an executive office, he was always found among the working journalists and media workers during their protests on non-implementation of the wage board awards and on the issue of press freedom.  
He had also served as president of the South Asia Free Media Association (Safma) that was established to promote networking among the media community, improve professional stan­dards, facilitate journalists’ exchanges and media trainings and undertake joint media productions in the region. 
Condolences started to pour in from the country’s journalist and media community, civil society and the political leadership with people paying tributes to late Zia Sb.  
Senior journalist Mubashir Zaidi called Ziauddin an “icon of Pakistani journalism”. 
Human Rights Minister Shireen Mazari remembered him to be “a man of principles, polite in discussions and debates, never adopting an accusatory tone”. 
Political analyst Mazhar Abbas said Ziauddin was not only an “outstanding journalist” but also “an iconic figure and a guide for all the young journalists”.  
“Ziauddin sahib’s struggle was not just against dictators; he put up with his fair share of irascible seniors and weak media owners .... By attempting to document some of these stories, I hope to remind the next generation of Pakistan’s journalists that they can prevail,” Mr Siddiqui had written in the introduction of the interview he conducted with Ziauddin Sb a few months ago.  
Meanwhile, the PFUJ announced a three-day mourning. The union says it has suspended all activities for three days and that offices of the journalist body would hoist black flags to mourn the death of the veteran journalist.  
In a statement issued on Monday, PFUJ president Shahzada Zulfiqar and secretary general Nasir Zaidi said the death of Ziauddin was not only a great loss for the journalist fraternity but also for all those who worked for rule of law, supremacy of parliament and upholding fundamental rights of all Pakistanis.  
Dr Masuma Hasan, president of the Aurat Foundation, on behalf of the Board of Governors, senior management and staff of the organisation, expressed deepest condolences on the death of the veteran journalist, who was also a board member of the organisation. “Mr Ziauddin is widely considered to be a teacher of teachers among Pakistan’s contemporary journalists. He has left behind a legacy of speaking truth to power,” she said.  
With his departure, Pakistan’s civil society and media industry have lost one of its leading and most well-respected advocates for human rights, democratic values, media professionalism and journalistic integrity.  
The Trust for Democratic Education and Advocacy also condoled the demise of Ziauddin, who was associated with the organisation as its chairperson till his death.  
Late Ziauddin has left behind a widow, two sons and two daughters to mourn his death. He was laid to rest at the Media Town graveyard. His funeral was attended by a large number of his old associates, journalists, politicians, members of civil society and Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Athar Minallah.

5,Govt decides to open more border trade points with Iran,QUETTA: A high-level meeting presided over by Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo has decided to ...,"QUETTA: A high-level meeting presided over by Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo has decided to open more border crossing points between Pakistan and Iran so that trade between the two countries does not come to a halt as it is the only source of income for the people of Makran.  
The meeting held in Turbat on Monday gave a final shape to the modus operandi for trading oil and edibles with Iran, being the only source of income for the local people of border areas. The officials concerned briefed the meeting participants about the traditional and proposed model of border trade. 
The meeting decided to abolish the condition of possession of a token for locals to cross into Iran and bring oil back with them. Instead, it was decided the local administration would register a driver and his helper on the basis of their national identity cards and steps would be taken for making the registration process easy. 
However, for security purposes, only locals would be extended the trading facilities. “No mafia would be allowed at any cost to benefit from this facility,” official sources told Dawn, adding that the institutions concerned would take effective steps for the purpose. Besides Makran, the people of Washuk, Kharan and Awaran would also benefit from the border trade facility. 
Corps Commander of 12 Corps Lt Gen Sarfraz Ali, provincial ministers Mir Zahoor Ahmed Buledi, Syed Ehsan Shah, Lala Rasheed Baloch, Akbar Askani and Mahjabeen Sheran, Chief Secretary Mathar Niaz Rana, Balochistan Inspector General of Police Mohammad Tahir Rai, the 44 Division GOC, Frontier Corps inspector general, Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister Asfandyar Kakar, Makran Commissioner Syed Irfan Shah Gharsheen and senior naval officials attended the meeting. 
The meeting was informed that presently there were 10 crossing points between Pakistan and Iran, including nine land routes and one sea. It was decided to open more border crossing points between the two neighboring countries. 
The meeting was also informed that for monitoring the trade affairs and providing facilities, an apex committee would be set up at the provincial level, while a district committee would be headed by the deputy commissioner. 
It was agreed that border trade would not be closed as it was the only source of income for the people of adjoining areas, while the traditional way of trading would continue till the establishment of border markets and provision of more facilities. “All the decisions and steps would be taken keeping in view of the ground realities and interests of the people,” the meeting decided. 
Chief Minister Bizenjo, while speaking on the occasion, said the government would provide maximum facilities, jobs and protection to the locals. He said there were apprehensions that anti-state elements could take advantage of the unemployment situation, but the government would provide maximum relief and facilities to the youths of the border areas.
