0,"Civic agencies charge parking fee at 124 places in city, SHC told",Traffic police say over 85 of such sites are on main roads,"KARACHI: The traffic police on Monday informed the Sindh High Court that the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, district municipal corporations and cantonment boards were running 124 charged parking spots in the metropolis and 88 of them were on main thoroughfares.
According to the comments filed in court on behalf of the DIG-traffic submitted that the traffic police had repeatedly conveyed its concerns to the Karachi commissioner and other authorities about allotment of charged parking sites on busy roads without consulting them, but to no avail.
The traffic police further submitted that it was always committed to take cognizance against traffic violations and during the current year i.e. from January to Nov 20, a total of 435 charged parking operators had been arrested in 349 FIRs lodged for undue road obstruction caused by double and triple parking.

Traffic police say over 85 of such sites are on main roads

When a two-judge SHC bench headed by Justice Naimatullah Phulpoto took up a petition for hearing against charged parking in the city, the KMC, DMC-South and Karachi traffic police filed comments and documents in compliance with the court’s last order. The bench adjourned the hearing till Jan 17 as lawyers for some other respondents sought time to file replies/comments.
The traffic police in its comments stated that out of 124 parking lots set up on roads and markets of the city, 46 were being run by the KMC, 71 by the DMCs, six by cantonment boards and one parking site is being run by the Civil Aviation Authority on its premises.
Of the 71 sites being run by city’s DMCs, 26 are operated by DMC-South, 25 by DMC-Keamari, 11 by DMC-Central, five by DMC-East and four charged parking sites are operated by DMC-Korangi, it added.
According to the traffic police, charged parking sites have also been set up along almost all the major roads of the city including Sharea Faisal, M. A. Jinnah Road, Rashid Minas Road, Tariq Road, University Road, Shahrah-i-Iraq, Shahra-i-Liaquat, Abdullah Haroon Road, Stadium Road, Saheed-i-Millat Road and Khalid Bin Walid Road.
The KMC in its comments maintained that it was authorised to charge parking fees on the roads it maintained under the Sindh Local Government Act (SLGA), 2013.
However, the documents attached with the comments of the KMC stated that the then administrator on the request of Karachi commissioner had granted permission in October 2000 to set up charged parking on 65 sites including main roads and markets of the city under the KMC by-laws of 1975.
The DMC-South in its reply also argued that it was empowered to collect the parking fees under the SLGA, by-laws and auction collection rights 2016.
On the last hearing, the SHC had directed the KMC, DIG-traffic, DMCs and other respondents to file comments and also assist it whether there was any structure available to regulate charged parking in the metropolis.
The bench had also asked the authorities concerned under which law parking fee was being charged from the citizens and who had authorised vehicles’ parking on roads.
A citizen had filed a petition stating that the Supreme Court had clearly restrained the authorities concerned from charging fee on the pretext of parking, but the respondents were still charging such a fee in different parts of the city in violation of the apex court’s order.

1,Sindh govt seeks 2m doses of Covid vaccines for booster shots,"Sindh Health Minister Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho says ""no evidence yet"" of the Omicron variant being present in Pakistan.","KARACHI: The Sindh government needs two million doses of Covid-19 vaccines to offer booster shots free of cost, said Health Minister Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho on Monday.
“We urge the federal government to improve surveillance at all entry points, including airports, and restart the rapid antigen test for passengers. Second, it’s important that people get booster doses so their immunity is enhanced against the virus,” she told a press conference against the backdrop of the new Covid-19 variant Omicron threat.
Right now, the minister pointed out, the provincial government did not have sufficient vaccines for that drive. “That’s why we have asked (the federal government) to provide us with 100,000 doses of Pfizer, 500,000 doses of Moderna and 500,000 doses of AstraZeneca,” she said. 
People above 65 years of age, patients with suppressed immune systems and front-line workers would be the first to receive booster shots that would be offered free of cost, the minister added. 
About the severity of the new Covid-19 variant that has reached several countries, Dr Pechuho said that though much was known about it as studies were continuing, Omicron had shown 30 mutations, which were not observed earlier in any of its strains. 
“There is no evidence yet about the presence of this new variant in Pakistan. However, the process of genomic profiling is in progress and the department would look into the cases Covid-19 reinfection in vaccinated individuals,” she said.

The fresh piece of information came during a visit of Wapda chairman retired Lt Gen Muzammil Hussain to the project site, where he said that the project had gathered pace recently under the Prime Minister’s Karachi Package. 
He expressed satisfaction on the overall progress of the project after he was briefed about the different aspects of the mega scheme.
“We [Wapda] have completed the revised design of K-IV project in accordance with the timelines,” he said. “The process for awarding construction works of the project is also under way.”
He said that following the award of the contract, the construction work on the project would commence in next three to four months. “Wapda is committed to complete the project in October 2023 to start supplying 650 mgd additional water to Karachi under the Prime Minister’s Karachi Package.”
During the visit, the Wapda chairman was accompanied by K-IV project director, representative of consultants and others. 
The project director briefed him about the major milestones achieved so far and the plan to execute the project according to the timelines. 
Later the Wapda chairman also visited the site of a dam project being constructed on Gaj River. He also met the Sindh chief secretary and discussed the matters related to K-IV, Nai Gaj, Sindh Barrage and Hub Dam with him.
The multibillion-rupee scheme was meant to meet the water needs of Karachiites but it remains a distant dream even after more than 10 years of its formal launch in 2011. 
Multiple causes delayed its completion and increased the estimated cost to Rs150bn. The federal government had finally taken over the project from the provincial government.

3,CM Murad stops transferred officials from leaving Sindh,"Provincial services, general administration, coordination department issued a letter asking officers not to leave their charge.","KARACHI: The row between the Sindh government and the Centre took a dramatic turn on Monday when Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah directed as many as 11 Grade-20 officers of Pakistan Administrative Service (PAS) and Police Services of Pakistan (PSP), who were transferred from Sindh to other provinces, not to relinquish their charge. 
The services of the 11 officers of PAS and PSP have been withdrawn from Sindh by the federal government through a notification issued on Nov 9 under a rotation policy. When the officers failed to comply with the transfer orders the establishment division issued them explanation letters.
They include four PAS officers — Syed Hassan Naqvi, chairman of Planning and Development Board, Sindh; Dr Kazim Hussain Jatoi, secretary of mines and mineral development department; Zahid Ali Abbasi, chief executive officer of the People’s Primary Healthcare Initiative (PPHI) and Khalid Hyder Shah, secretary of the college education department — and seven DIGs —Abdullah Shaikh, Saqib Ismail Memon, Naeem Ahmed Shaikh, Omar Shahid Hamid, Nauman Siddiqui, Javed Akbar Riaz, and retired Lt Maqsood Ahmed.
The provincial services, general administration and coordination department issued a letter asking the officers not to relinquish their charge “till further order” as directed by the chief minister.
It may be recalled that the chief minister a week ago had requested Prime Minister Imran Khan to direct the establishment division to fill the shortage of officers of BS-17 to BS-21 and depute requisite number of officers to the province.
In a letter to the PM, he had stated that the provincial government considered the Nov 9 notifications of officers’ transfer and postings in the province as ‘proposals’ from the establishment division and did not agree to them to withdraw the four PAS and seven PSP officers.
However, the chief minister said, the provincial government agreed to the proposal of deputing four PAS officers — Atif Rehman, Khalid Saleem, Noreen Bashir and Ali Hussain Malik — and as many PSP officers in BS-20 — Muhammad Karim Khan, Shahzad Akbar, Muhammad Zubair Dreshak and Syed Khuram Ali — in Sindh.

5,Vets suggest shifting of elephants from Karachi Zoo to Safari Park,The experts are to submit a report to the SHC today recommending a number of steps necessary for the elephants' well-being.,"KARACHI: The team of veterinary experts from the international animal rights group Four Paws made a longer visit to Karachi Zoo on Monday to assess and evaluate the health conditions and well-being of the remaining two female elephants, Noor Jehan and Madhubala. 
Soon after their arrival in Karachi, a day prior, they had spent most of their time at the Safari Park to review the health and living conditions of the two female elephants there, Sonu and Malika, after a very brief visit to the Zoo where they had found Noor Jehan and Madhubala somewhat agitated, making them postpone their examination for a day. 
But on Monday they were able to take blood and urine samples and conducted a number of tests on Noor Jehan and Madhubala at the Zoo. 
The experts are to submit a report before the Sindh High Court (SHC) on Tuesday (today) recommending a number of steps necessary for the well-being of the elephants. 
According to sources, among the recommendations they are going to submit, the top most is medical treatment of the older of the two elephants at the Zoo, 17-year-old Noor Jehan. Her tusk is broken and needs serious and urgent medical attention. Noor Jehan’s treatment might cost 100,000 Euros as it would require importing expert vets and equipment. Otherwise, she is in constant pain.

Four Paws team visits Karachi Zoo to assess well-being of two female elephants 

As for the other elephant there, 16-year-old Madhubala, it was observed her reproduction cycle has not started even at this advanced age (for a female elephant, the usual age is from 12 years). This is a clear sign of stress or malnutrition. The vets observed and recommended re-adjustment of her diet. Presently, the elephants are being fed 100kgs sugar cane, which is quite unhealthy for them.
Another issue, as observed by the experts, is that Karachi Zoo elephants are living with noise pollution. There is permanent noise from traffic there. Their enclosures also lack natural habitat and swimming facilities such as a nice big green area where they could roam about and swim for leisure. Therefore it would be a good idea if they are also shifted to the Safari Park or their present enclosure at the Zoo may be enlarged and modified.
For the Safari Park, the experts recommended that the elephants’ shelter be enlarged and the swimming pool may be expanded like a natural river. 
Capacity building of staff has also been stressed in the recommendations to be submitted before the SHC. Both the elephants and their staff need training as it is a must for the medical care and treatment of the animals.
It has been one year after the spectacular rescue by Four Paws of the elephant Kaavan, who was transferred from Islamabad to Cambodia and now lives a species-appropriate life in an elephant sanctuary. The global animal welfare organisation returned to Pakistan, which recently banned the import of new elephants following the advice from Four Paws. 
The team of veterinarians and wildlife experts is lead by Dr Amir Khalil and comprising Dr Frank Göritz and Prof Thomas Hildebrandt from the Leibnitz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research (IZW) and Dr Marina Ivanova from Four Paws.

Artists constantly look for the latter. They know that a particular divergence from the regularity of life can enable them to create. And this is where the stark difference between loneliness and solitude comes into play. A group show titled Divergent that’s under way at the Art Chowk Gallery aims to highlight this particular aspect of creative souls’ lives by exhibiting some striking works of art.
The curator of the show, Irfan Gul Dahri, in his statement to inform the viewer about the drift of the assembled works says, “Kids imaginative and pretend-play reveals that we can use several approaches and manipulate our emotions and ideas at any given time. A combination of conscious mind and wild imagination, intuition and reason, solitude and collaboration has proven time and again that these childlike hybrid sensibilities have provided the most of what we have in today’s revolutionised world. A subversive mind takes the risk of negative criticism, possible failure, loss of reputation and loved ones yet knows very well that its unwillingness to abide by the orthodox approach is the only path to innovation and greatness. It takes a brave heart and a divergent mind to create- to be an artist.” 
This is a bold claim. But the moment the viewer sets foot in the gallery, the essence of the claim begins to sink in. The 10 participating artists have clearly put on display pieces that speak of a departure from the usual goings-on. Not in the sense of newness, but in a way that underlines value of creation in an atmosphere away from everyday hubbub. Consequently, be it the duality of the self or the masks worn by heads of state, be it energies received from the world outside of the physical domain or the façade of a dilapidated stone-made home with a half-ajar wooden door… all have been captured with sensitivity and aesthetic grace. It’s a not to be missed show!    
The artists who are taking part in the exhibition, which concludes on Dec 6, are: Sheema Khan, Muzammil Khan, Raheela Abro, Rahman Zada, Ghulam Hussain, Hadia Moiz, Abida Dahri, Syeda Seerat Zainab, Rehmat Hazara and Sahyr Syed.

7,JI to launch drive against new LG bill from tomorrow,A delegation of PSP calls on Jamaat-i-Islami leaders; PML-N expresses concerns on new law,"KARACHI: Rejecting the recently-passed Sindh Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2021, the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) on Monday announced launching a “massive protest campaign” for the withdrawal of the legislation from Wednesday (tomorrow).
It has planned sit-ins, a black day and rallies against what it called the “dictatorial law”, which would turn the province into a “Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) colony”.
The JI leaders said that the party had decided to take to the streets against the bill after every effort to convince the PPP government and suggesting measures for a better and effective local government system had failed to fetch positive results.
“They [PPP leaders] only want anyone from their party to run the affairs of this province despite the fact that they are no longer wanted,” Karachi JI chief Hafiz Naeemur Rahman told a press conference at Idara-i-Noor-i-Haq.

A delegation of PSP calls on Jamaat-i-Islami leaders; PML-N expresses concerns on new law

He said: “The PPP is so scared and so sure about its defeat in the LG polls in urban Sindh that it in a haste has prepared such a vulnerable, ineffective and so ill-written draft for the law which doesn’t prove its own utility. Since the government isn’t ready to pay heed and follow the democratic norms, it would find us among the people who would take to the street and express their anger.”
He said under the party’s “Save Karachi” movement protest sit-ins against the bill would be held at 11 key points across the city on Dec 1 (tomorrow) followed by a “Black Day” to be observed on Dec 3 featuring protest demonstrations, walks and corner meetings in different parts of the metropolis.
“On Dec 12, a massive Save Karachi march will be taken out to be attended by prominent individuals from all walks of life,” he said. “I also heard the other day when LG Minister Syed Nasir Hussain was claiming that the bill was drafted in line with JI recommendations. It’s so unfortunate that people deceive and lie just for political gains. The JI has always recommended an empowered mega city government in Karachi but the PPP government tabled a bill for a powerless and ceremonial set-up, depriving it from previously available powers.”
PSP delegation visits JI office
Meanwhile, a delegation of the Pak Sarzameen Party (PSP) comprising Shabbir Kaimkhani, Arshad Vohra and others visited Idara-i-Noor-i-Haq and met JI leaders to discuss the problems of Karachi and situation emerged after the passage of the recent LG bill in the Sindh Assembly.
The two sides agreed that the PPP was bent upon depriving the people of Karachi of their basic rights and vowed to continue their struggle from their political platforms against what they termed an anti-democratic rule in Sindh.
PML-N reservations 
The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), on the other hand, also raised its serious reservations over the Sindh LG (Amendment) Bill 2021.
In a statement, the general secretary of the PML-N’s Karachi chapter, Nasiruddin Mahmood, said the bill negated the spirit of democracy and did not comply with the definition of devolution of powers.
He demanded that the PPP government review its stance and also give space to the opposition in line with democratic norms.

The labourer, Sadruddin Walhari, was shot dead in what the Gharo police had claimed an “encounter that also left two policemen dead” a couple of months back.
The protesters, who started their four-kilometre march from Makli, held a sit-in outside the Thatta Press Club. 
Displaying placards inscribed with slogans for justice and against police, they kept raising slogans against Gharo SHO Mumtaz Brohi and his subordinates’ team all along the route of their march. They demanded a fair investigation into the “custodial killing” of Walhari.
Speaking to them, Daadli Walhari, wife of the deceased, Shareefa Walhari, Dr Nusrat Palijo and others condemned the area police over the alleged custodial killing. 
“The police team not only killed Sadruddin Walhari in cold blood but also celebrated the murder by waving official arms while their mobile van carrying the body passed by a crowd of local residents who had gathered at the site of the fake encounter,” Daadli Walhari told media personnel outside the press club.  
She said she and her family members had been frequenting the police station and offices of higher police officers ever since the incident but were not being obliged to lodge an FIR.
Dr Nusrat Palijo said that deceased Walhari was a labourer and had gone missing after SHO Brohi and his team picked him up. 
“It was after an uproar in the social media over his disappearance that the police team brought the body to the farmhouse where, according to the police, two policemen were killed in a shootout with dacoits,” she said.
The protesters claimed that the SHO waving his official weapon in one hand and showing the victory sign with the other took his team for a ride by the van that carried Walhari’s body. The van took rounds of different localities of Makli and Thatta, they added.
It is pertinent to mention here that the official police version of the incident claimed that the Gharo police raided a farmhouse in Makli to arrest some dacoits. 
An encounter with those present inside the farmhouse ensued in which one dacoit and two constables were killed. 
The dead dacoit was later identified as Sadruddin Walhari, the police had claimed.

11,Municipal workers go on strike across Sindh,"Sanitation, water supply system affected in many cities and towns","KARACHI: Municipal workers started an indefinite strike across Sindh on Monday on a call given by provincial chapter of the All Pakistan Local Government Workers Federation.
The strike remained effective in most cities and towns of Hyderabad, Larkana, Sukkur, Shikarpur, Jacobabad, Kandhkot-Kashmore, Khairpur, Ghotki and some other districts.
The protesting workers are demanding that their salaries and pensions be disbursed through treasury offices.
In Larkana district, municipal workers boycotted their routine duties and locked down their rooms in their respective municipalities of the city and different towns, including Naudero.
Their leaders, Rasool Bakhsh Shahani, Munawwar Sandano, Dodo Khan Mirani and others had held a press conference in Larkana city on Nov 22 to set the deadline of Nov 28 for the acceptance of their demand.

Sanitation, water supply system affected in many cities and towns

Larkana Municipal Corporation (LMC) workers responding to the federation’s call observed a pen-down strike after locked offices to ensure suspension of all routine works.
Speaking to the workers and local reporteRs, Mr Shahani criticised Sindh government for its “double-faced” policy. He said that except for municipalities, all other departments were regularly disbursing salaries to their employees through treasury offices. He called for an end to this sort of discrimination. He alleged that Sindh government was intentionally ignoring the legitimate demand.
Shah Latif Local Govt Employees Federation’s Sindh chairman Hafiz Mushtaq Korejo led a sit-in held in Naudero.
Speaking to the media, he said the protest would continue till the acceptance of the demand. He said the federation had already informed Sindh government, local government department, district administrations and all others concerned about the strike plan.
He argued that when employees of other departments were getting salaries, pensions etc through treasury offices, why the LG employees were denied this facility.
He claimed that 95pc municipal employees were facing injustice in disbursement of salaries. In the [Larkana] municipal corporation and certain other municipal committees, district councils and town committees, employees were getting half salary while salaries of numerous others were stopped on one pretext or the other. Also, there were cases where Rs10,000 to Rs15,000 illegal cuts in salaries were made.
SUKKUR: Municipal workers, observing a strike on the call of the federation which was endorsed by the municipal labour unions of many districts, held rallies and demonstrations in various cities and towns of Sukkur, Shikarpur, Jacobabad, Kandhkot-Kashmore, Khairpur and Ghotiki districts on Monday.
They raised slogans against the provincial government and secretaries of the LG and finance departments for their indifferent attitude towards their issue. 
Speaking to the protesting workers and media personnel outside the Sukkur Press Club, their leaders said they had long been sending applications to the authorities concerned for the online payment system through treasures for disbursement of salaries, pensions, dues etc but to no avail.
They said disbursement through manual payroll caused hardship to workers and often most of them got salaries or pension very late. This ultimately disturbed domestic affairs involving money, they added.
The strike caused accumulation of heaps of garbage on roads and in streets of major cities like Sukkur, Ghotki and Jacobabad. In many areas overflowing drains and gutters remained unattended. Complaints of disruption in water supply were also received from many areas.

The president chaired a meeting at Governor House where he sought details of probe made so far into the killing of Sakhawat Rajput, senior vice president of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Qambar-Shahdadkot.  
Sakhawat was shot dead and his nephew Zubair Rajput was wounded in an attack on them near Lalurounk town, 30 kilometres from Larkana on Friday. 
Sakhawat, who had contested for National Assembly seats on PTl tickets in 2013 and 2018 general elections, was sitting in his rice mill when two armed men barged inside and targeted him. 
During the meeting, President Alvi was also briefed by Opposition Leader in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh about police’s attitude, avoiding registration of a case in the first place and then delaying the investigation process. 
“It’s not the first time such an incident has taken place in Sindh as earlier in identical incidents a cobbler, a hotel owner and other poor workers have lost their lives and political opponents have been targeted in the province,” said Sheikh. 
‘People should not feel intimidated by police’
A statement issued by the Governor House after the meeting said that the president was of the view that police were supposed to do their job without any discrimination and people should not feel intimidated when seeking help from the law-enforcement agency. 
“All due measures should be ensured for the arrest of the killers [of Sakhawat Rajput]. The police should focus on its duty and professionalism. No excuse will be tolerated with regard to maintenance of law and order,” he said.

The PMA leaders, who met virtually with Dr Mirza Ali Azhar in the chair, urged authorities concerned to make all out efforts to resolve the case by using latest scientific methods and share results of the inquiry with the victim’s family, media and civil society. 
The meeting expressed deep concern over the incident as it was not the first at the college. Just a few months back, Dr Nimarta was also found dead in similar circumstances but nothing happened by way of fact finding, it said. 
It said that Dr Nosheen’s family was not willing to accept her death as suicide. It was, however, encouraging to learn that Sindh Assembly had promised free and fair inquiry into the incident but the fact of the matter was that such promises by the government mostly proved hollow as they never bore fruits and things were gradually pushed under the carpet, it said. 
The meeting cautioned that if such incidents were not checked, parents of students, especially girls, would become worried about safety and security of their children and they would think twice before sending them to other cities to get education.  
The parents might decide to discontinue their education out of fear for their safety and it would be a disaster if it happened, said the meeting.  
HYDERABAD: In the wake of mysterious death of an MBBS student in CMC Larkana a few days ago, Sindh University decided to review overall facilities being provided to female students living in girls’ dormitories and said no compromise should be made if a harassment complaint was received from a student. 
A meeting of the university administration chaired by vice chancellor Prof Dr Mohammad Siddique Kalhoro at the office of provost of Marvi girls hostel on Monday said that anyone found responsible for harassment would be warned and investigation would be started immediately into the complaint.

Reports said that a fruit trader, Mr Saeed, intended to build his shop on his plot Nos. 50/55 on a 10-ft-wide road in front of two other shops owned by Faiz Bhutto in the fruit section of the mandi. Apparently due to erroneous demarcation in the revised layout plan, they indulged in a heated argument.
Mr Bhutto told Dawn that Mr Rind was allowing Mr Saeed to build his shop in front of his (Bhutto’s) shops.
Amid a tense situation, Mr Rind’s private guards came and allegedly misbehaved with Mr Bhutto. Mr Rind also arrived and Mr Bhutto argued with him over the matter. The guards again misbehaved with traders and allegedly resorted to firing into the air. Some traders picked stones to face them but due to firing, they ran for shelter.
Mr Rind ordered closure of mandi’s main gate which caused panic among traders, who feared that they might be attacked by the armed guards. Police also arrived there to restore order.
Later, Mr Rind denied the claim that any shots were fired. He said he was there to check encroachment and when he tried to do so, some traders got angry and exchanged hot words with him.
Mr Bhutto said he feared for his life as armed guards were roaming in the mandi. He said he left the mandi following the incident.
