It is said to be the first incident of burking of crime figures in such a large number that has been detected and the matter was officially reported in recent meetings of the police high-ups.
Some police experts say the term, ‘burking’, has been associated with the crime in the law that means failure to get the information of crime recorded, stifling the criminal investigation process.
An official, privy to the information, said these complaints had gone unreported when police manipulated them to show crime rate down. He said the unethical practice had deprived the citizens of their fundamental rights to take the criminals to the court of law for recovery of their snatched/stolen properties.

Figures burked to show crime down; FIRs now registered on ignored complaints

The official said the citizens had filed 16,533 complaints between Jan 1 to Oct 31 in all six divisions of the Lahore police. All the complaints pertained to the heinous crime, including vehicle snatching, theft, robbery and robbery, gone unreported in the police record.
The much disturbing part of the development was that police had also fudged the crime related to the snatching and theft of vehicles. This form of crime had not gone unreported in the past in such a large number, as is evident from the figures available with Dawn.
The data showed the thieves had taken away 4,209 motorbikes and 139 cars or other vehicles of the citizens besides snatching at gunpoint 45 motorcycles and three cars or other vehicles from the citizens during the 10 months. All these crimes were registered in the month of November.
This unveiled a terrible tendency to fudge the crime figures in the provincial capital right under the nose of the chief minister, head of provincial police and many other offices of the authorities concerned.
The police experts say the efficiency of the police officers is measured usually by escalation or decline of crime rate. They are of the view that the data shows the officers during the period mentioned above tried to ‘manage crime’ by not recording it.
“The manipulation of crime figures was often touted as worst precedent of unprofessionalism that has plagued the police department,” a senior police officer comments.
He says lodging of the FIR is responsibility of the state to maintain a record of the commission of cognizable offences that helps it to assess the law and order situation prevailing in the city.
The official data of refusing the fundamental rights of the citizens to lodge their complaints against criminals in such a large number has badly exposed the police officers as well as the available mechanism.
It said out of total 16,533 unreported complaints, 16 were about dacoities, 2,365 of robberies, 4,413 snatching/theft of vehicles, 570 of house and shop thefts, 1,360 complaints of street crime, 7,210 of properties and 599 were miscellaneous.
According to the division-wise breakdown of the figures, the Cantonment Division was on top of all others by denying FIRs on 4,188 complaints, followed by Model Town Division 3,356 complaints and Civil Lines Division with 2,770 complaints.
Similarly, the City Division had not lodged criminal cases on 2,609 complaints, Saddar Division refused 2,077 while Iqbal Town Division turned down 1,533 complaints from Jan 1 to Oct 31.
Another official, privy to the information, said the police authorities had prepared these official figures after going through a detailed analysis of the complaints gone unreported during the first 10 months of this year.
After a detailed deliberations on the issue in a couple of meetings, he said, the police high-ups sent these old unreported complaints to all the divisional SPs to get them reconfirmed before lodging the FIRs. He said in the entire situation, the beneficiaries were the criminals/robbers who had escaped punishments from the court of law despite committing offences.
After a process of verification, the official added, the police registered 16,533 new FIRs on old complaints that increased burden manifold on the investigation wing, which was already short of staff and logistics.

3,Shehbaz to PM Imran: ‘Step down instead of presenting mini-budget’,"“There is serious danger to defence capabilities and government as a consequence of conditions of the IMF”, he says.","LAHORE: PML-N President and opposition leader in National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif has asked Prime Minister Imran Khan to step down instead of burdening the people with a mini-budget.
“Imran Niazi must resign instead of burdening the masses with a mini-budget and the government’s coalition partners must stand up against this step for national interest,” Shehbaz said in a statement here on Monday.
He said the joint opposition would resist this mini-budget with all its strength. “This will be a pact of slavery of Pakistani people and spell doomsday for them with inflation. Price of petrol and electricity will skyrocket further and make survival impossible,” he lambasted the PTI government.
The opposition leader further said he had been proven right about the government’s nation-crushing mini-budgets while PTI’s lies had been exposed yet again.
“The PTI government has lied to the people and parliament, and exhibited criminal negligence in safeguarding national interest and national security. Mini-budget on IMF’s direction sounds alarm bells for national security,” he said and added this mini-budget and legislation regarding GST would make Pakistan’s State Bank a slave of the IMF.
“There is a serious danger to Pakistan’s defense capabilities and government being paralyzed as a consequence of these conditions of the IMF”, he said.
Shehbaz Sharif said increase in taxes would shutter more businesses, further shrink the economy and cause more unemployment. The budget presented by PTI was a fraud on the nation and this government had unleashed another hell of inflation on the people of Pakistan, he lamented.
Meanwhile, opposition leader in Punjab Assembly Hamza Shehbaz said the Niazi government had increased gas tariff by 350 per cent and planned to go for further (increase).
In a statement here, Hamza said the whole country had been facing a gas crisis and the people were forced to use wood. Besides, the price of LPG had also shot up to Rs220 per kg, he said and added the government had committed crime for not acquiring LPG timely.

District and Sessions Judge Rao Abdul Jabbar Khan had on Nov 26 handed down three-month imprisonment each to both bureaucrats and also ordered the district police officer to shift them to jail.
However, it is learnt that the DPO kept the convicted officers detained in the DC house instead of taking them to jail as per the court orders.
The bureaucrats challenged their conviction before the LHC.
Chief Justice Muhammad Ameer Bhatti heard their appeals as an “objection case” as the registrar office had objected to the maintainability of the appeals.
The office said the appellants filed appeals against their conviction without surrendering before the law.
Lahore High Court Bar Association President Maqsood Buttar and Advocate Mubashar Rehman appeared on behalf of the convicted bureaucrats, who were present in the court. The chief justice overruled the office objection.
The counsel argued that the impugned judgement whereby the petitioners were convicted was beyond the scope of the provisions of the law as envisaged under sections 480 and 482 of CrPC.
The chief justice observed that prima facie the contention raised by the counsel had no force as the impugned judgement was silent concerning the procedure to be adhered to by the district judge while awarding the punishment.
The judge further observed that Article 10-A of the Constitution gave an individual a right to fair trial and due process of law.
The chief justice suspended the conviction of the petitioners and granted them bail subject to furnishing surety bonds of Rs20,000 each. The petitioners were also directed to appear on the next hearing of the appeals.
A citizen had filed a case in the consumer court of D&SJ Rao Abdul Jabbar Khan pleading that he had been allotted an official residence in the Wapda Colony but the local administration had issued another allotment letter of the same house to a schoolteacher.
The petitioner alleged that a litigation clerk, Rana Mehboob Ali, of the local administration forcibly and unlawfully ousted him from the house.
The consumer court judge had summoned the DC and AC, however, they sent the litigation clerk to the court who also misbehaved the judge.
It is stated that the DC personally made a phone call to the judge asking him to set the litigation clerk free while the AC also appeared before the court and misbehaved the judge. Consequently, the judge convicted both officers under contempt of court charges.

On Monday, the model and blogger as well as the brand stirred emotions for posting ‘barehead’ pictures taken on the premises of the gurdwara in district Narowal.
The management of the online brand, Mannat Clothing, had allegedly posted multiple pictures of the photoshoot on a social networking site. The Pakistani model was seen posing in front of the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib wearing a red outfit with her head uncovered. As a mark of respect, it is mandatory for all men and women to cover their heads while visiting a gurdwara.
Reacting to the clothing brand’s shoot video and pictures, Sikh journalist Ravinder Singh Robin tweeted: “Modelling bareheaded for ladies’ attire, in the premises of Gurdwara Sri Darbar Sahib at Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan, by a Lahorite woman, has several hurt the religious sentiments of Sikhs. Further, the pictures were uploaded on social media”.
Sharing of video and photoshoot by the Indian journalist put the PTI government on its toes, leading Chief Minister Usman Buzdar, federal ministers among others criticizing the designers and the model. The CM ordered action against the staff that allowed the shoot and sought a report on the incident.
Federal Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry tweeted: “The Designer and the model must apologise to Sikh Community. KartarPur Sahib is a religious symbol and not a Film set…..”
Special Assistant to Prime Minister Dr Shahbaz Gill, in his tweet, termed the modeling shoot as “Stupid and unthoughtful”.
When contacted, Punjab government spokesman Hasaan Khawar told Dawn that the whole incident was being investigated on three aspects – why model did the shoot at the religious place; why the clothing brand officials did not take due diligence while uploading the video and pictures on social media and the conduct of staff whether they were unaware, negligent or committed offence by allowing the shoot.
Mannat Clothing has apologised for the incident, stating, “We accept our mistake that we should not have posted this content. We wholeheartedly apologise to every single person, who was offended by this”.
On a social media site, the clothing brand stated, “The pictures posted on our account are not part of any shoot done by Mannat Clothing. The pictures were provided to the brand by a third-party (blogger) in which she was wearing its dress”. It stated that the Mannat Clothing had absolutely no role in deciding how and where the pictures were taken. “All the holy places are very sacred to us,” it said.
Sauleha Imtiaz, the model and blogger, has also apologised, writing on her Instagram
account: “Recently I posted a picture on instagram that was not even a part of a shoot or anything. I just went to kartarpur to learn about the history and know about the sikh community. It wasnt done to hurt anyone sentiments or anything for that matter. However, if i have hurt anyone or they think that I dont respect there culture. I am Sorry (sic)”.
She said she respected Sikh culture and apologiised to the Sikh community. She added, “These pictures were just a part of a memory that i went there. Nothing more nothing less”.
SAPM Dr Gill has, however, termed brand’s explanation as absurd. “I read their explanation, that they received these pictures videos from a third party. Absurd logic. Were you blind when you were using it on your official accounts?” Dr Gill tweeted.
Punjab Police stated the management of brand and the model were being investigated.

LAHORE: This winter, the Government College University has been turned into a magical Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as the week-long Harry Potter festival began on Monday on the campus.
The festival that the university is hosting till Dec 5 also marks the screening of Pakistan’s first Harry Potter fan movie titled The Last Follower and the Resurrection of Voldemort.
This comes a decade after the last Harry Potter film The Deathly Hallows Part-2 was released in 2011. And, the quest to find what happened in the world of Harry Potter years after the death of Lord Voldemort is what inspired the Khayaali Productions, a group of students from GCU, to come up with a film on the subject.
The film is a roller coaster of magical visuals shot at the gothic architecture of GCU and it was premiered exclusively at the Bukhari Auditorium from Nov 29 and will continue till Dec 5.
Waleed Akram, a former student of GCU, is the director, cinematographer, and editor of the movie.
According to Waleed, the purpose of introducing this new genre was to show our love towards the magical world of Harry Potter for the first time. Moreover, he says, the fan-made movie also reflects the potential of our youth who pulled it off with extremely limited resources.
He said they started working on the project way back in 2018 but Covid-19 delayed some re-shoots.
Vice Chancellor Prof. Zaidi said: “Our youth has immense potential and we just need to provide them opportunities, little guidance and support.”
The main cast includes Umer Darr, Jazib Akram, Mariam Hassan Naqvi, Talha Chahour, Dua Marium, and Sheikh Mubashir. The extraordinary visual effects are done by Zeeshan Hameed. Ibrahim Hassan is the associate director and productions head of the movie.
The festival includes other than the screening of movies, Harry Potter experiential space at GCU Salam Hall, Harry Potter merchandise, food stalls, face paint and posters and photo booths.

The mills had suspended production in 2007 when a goods train carrying its products (meant for exports) was burnt during arson attacks following the murder of former premier Benazir Bhutto. Since the mills couldn’t deliver textile export orders, foreign buyers claimed millions of Euros as damages from the mills.
Talking to Dawn, mills chief executive officer Mian Muhammad Latif said now he had employed more than 5,000 people. He said people had spread rumours about the future of the Chenab Mills but he kept pursuing the government and banks to reschedule their loans.
“I did not seek any loan write-off. My sole request to the people at the helm of affairs was rescheduling.” After the struggle of about 14 years, he said, he had succeeded in convincing the quarters concerned to revive sick units.
Mian Latif has rendered services for the establishment of the Faisalabad Industrial Estate Development and Management Company (FIEDMC), dry port and the Pakistan Textile Exporters Association.
He said the death of BB and 2008 US meltdown badly affected textile mills as the US buyers refused to receive products worth billions of rupees.
“The situation badly affected the cash flow and we had to closed the mills, leaving more than 14000 people unemployed, plus those connected indirectly.”
Mian Latif said he couldn’t forget the help extended to him by former MNA late Rana Muhammad Afzal of the PML-N. Similarly, he said, former president of the FPCCI Mian Idrees and others also tried their level best for the revival of sick units, including the Chenal Mills.

She stated that in Doha, she was not allowed to board the connected flight to Barcelona, saying she had no visa for Spain while her father was allowed to take the connected flight as he was having a Schengen visa (a short stay visa allowing its holder to circulate in the Schengen area which covers 26 countries) which also is valid for Spain.
She stated she requested the provision of an alternate flight but in vain and ultimately she was forced to travel back to Pakistan.
She held responsible both the travel agent and the airlines for missing the ceremony by her due to their irresponsible and incompetency as they planned an incorrect route.
Additional District and Sessions Judge/Presiding Officer of the District Consumer Court Mahmood Haroon Khan in his decision stated that both respondents in their written statements termed the claim ‘not maintainable’, saying a false and frivolous complaint was filed by the complainant.
“I’m of the considered view that petitioner has suffered a great religious and social loss and missed a very rare scared gathering (according to her belief) due to negligence, carelessness and non-professional behaviour of the respondents,” the judge wrote.
He directed the respondents to refund Rs125,500 of the ticket price, Rs12,000 of visa fee, Rs20,000 of travelling expenses and Rs100,000 for legal expenses besides Rs5 million (Rs2.5 million by each respondent) to the petitioner within 30 days.

17,PPLA opposes move to give college land to university,SAHIWAL: The Punjab Professors and Lecturers Association has opposed an official move to give 130-kanal land of the...,"SAHIWAL: The Punjab Professors and Lecturers Association has opposed an official move to give 130-kanal land of the Government Graduate College, Mianwali, to the University of Mianwali.
Varsity VC Dr Islamullah Khan has requested the Higher Education Department (HED) for the transfer of the college land to the UOM. Since the university project has been launched by Prime Minister Imran Khan, the HED took no time in forwarding the VC request to the Directorate of Colleges, Sargodha Division, and immediately sought revenue records of college land.
PPLA Divisional President Hafiz Ramzan told Dawn the college land which was reserved for sports and other co-curricular activities was up for grabs.
Afzal Khan Niazi, PPLA president of the Minwali college, said instead of providing missing facilities to public sector colleges, the HED was grabbing their assets.”In this case, the land is being to an autonomous chartered university.”
Sahibzada Ahmed Nadeem, PPLA Secretary General, told Dawn college teachers had passed a resolution asking HED to refrain from this move.
Established in 1950, the Mianwali college owns 330 Kanal 14 marlas land. Of it, 130 kanal is reserved for cricket and other sports activities.
University VC Prof Dr Khan told Dawn the university had no space and building to accommodate 4,000 students.
“It is in this background that we requested the HED to award college’s unutilised land for a short period,” he said.
Dr Islam said the university needed an independent 1000-1500 kanal land for which finances were not allocated.
