• Vaccination drive to be restarted in provinces
• Studies being conducted to understand the new strain       
ISLAMABAD: The National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) on Monday warned that the arrival of Omicron — said to be the most virulent strain of Covid-19 — into Pakistan was inevitable and feared that health system could collapse in the coming weeks due to its high transmissibility. 
In South Africa, the positivity rate increased tenfold, from 0.9 per cent to 9.77pc, in just 12 days.   
It further said that apparently genetic coding of the virus had changed but vaccines were still effective against it, suggesting that around 30 million partially-vaccinated people should get themselves inoculated at the earliest. 
After the meeting of the NCOC, Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Asad Umar along with Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health Dr Faisal Sultan held a press briefing. 
Mr Umar said the new variant had reached a number of European and Asian countries. 
“According to initial reports, it is an extremely virulent variant. In Pakistan 50 million people have been fully vaccinated and 30m are partially immunised. As the NCOC takes decisions according to the current situation, on Monday we decided to increase the number of tests in 
high-risk areas and expedite contact tracing,” the minister said, adding that, “travel restrictions have been placed on some countries, with more regions to be included in the travel advisory soon”. 
Mr Umar said Pakistan could delay the entry of the virus within its borders, but could not stop it. 
“The world has become a global village, therefore the virus would definitely reach Pakistan,” Mr Umar said, adding that, “what we have in our hands is vaccination therefore every person should get inoculated at the earliest as vaccines were effective against the new variant”. 
The minister further said they had just two to three weeks, “so we are going to start a new vaccination campaign in all provinces”. 
“We have also started considering giving booster shots,” he added. 
Speaking on the occasion, Dr Sultan said during the last one-and-a-half years, people had been updated a number of times about the pandemic. 
“However for the last few weeks, infections have continuously been increasing throughout the world, with most casualties being reported among those who could not be vaccinated,” the special assistant said. 
“The new variant has been spreading rapidly, which can put pressure on the health system. It has some mutations due to which the potential of transmissibility has increased,” he added. 
The prime minister’s aide said international flights were being reviewed but as the whole world was connected, it was impossible to stop transportation of the virus. 
“We are left with only one option and that was to ensure every person was immunised,” he said, adding that, “we need to further increase vaccination”. 
Get yourself vaccinated today not tomorrow,” Dr Sultan stressed.     
It is worth mentioning here that on Nov 27, Pakistan placed South Africa, Hong Kong, Mozambique, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini and Botswana in category C and imposed complete ban on direct/indirect inbound travel from these countries with immediate effect. 
Pakistani passengers travelling from these countries on extreme emergency will only be allowed after undergoing a number of health/testing protocols including presenting vaccination certificates, negative PCR report (72 hours old maximum) before boarding and rapid antigen tests (RAT) on arrival at the airport. 
The RAT negative cases would undergo three-day mandatory home quarantine and re-RAT carried out on the third day by the civil administration. 
Positive cases would have to observe a mandatory quarantine (government/self-paid) for 10 days after which a PCR test would be conducted. 
To facilitate stranded Pakistanis, travel from these countries will be allowed till Dec 5 without exemption but the above-mentioned health/testing protocols will remain applicable. 
An official of the Ministry of National Health Services (NHS) said Pakistan had introduced three categories to deal with coronavirus. 
“Countries in A category are exempted from the mandatory Covid-19 test, travellers from areas in B category require a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test that must be taken within 72 hours of the travel date while countries in C category are restricted and people can travel only under specific NCOC guidelines,” he said. 
Meanwhile, the NCOC data showed that nine patients succumbed to the virus and 176 more got infected during the last 24 hours. 
The infection rate was calculated at 0.59pc, with 966 patients hospitalised. 
Studies on Omicron
Researchers in South Africa and around the world are conducting studies to better understand Omicron and will share the findings as they become available. 
The World Health Organisation (WHO), in a statement, said: “It is not yet clear whether Omicron is more transmissible (e.g. more easily spread from person to person) compared to other variants, including Delta.” 
However, the statement said, the number of positive cases had risen in areas of South Africa affected by the new strain. Epidemiologic studies were being conducted to understand whether the spike in cases was due to Omicron or other factors, it added. 
Similarly it is not yet clear whether infection with Omicron causes more severe disease. 
Preliminary data suggests that there are increasing rates of hospitalisation in South Africa, but this may be due to increase in the number of people getting infected, rather than a result of specific infection with Omicron. 
Preliminary evidence suggests that there may be an increased risk of re-infection with Omicron (people who have previously had Covid-19 could become re-infected more easily with Omicron) compared to other variants, but information is limited. 
At present, the WHO is coordinating with a large number of researchers around the world to better understand the new strain. 
The WHO has encouraged countries to contribute to the collection and share hospitalised patient data through the WHO Covid-19 Clinical Data Platform to rapidly describe clinical characteristics and patient outcomes.

1,SBP signs agreement for $3bn Saudi fund,Adviser on Finance Shaukat Tarin briefs Prime Minister Imran about revenue receipts.,"KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan on Monday signed an agreement with the Saudi Fund for Development (SFD) to receive $3 billion, which will be placed in the SBP’s account with an aim to improve its foreign exchange reserves. 
The agreement was signed by SFD Chief Executive Officer Sultan Bin Abdul Rahman Al-Marshad and SBP Governor Dr Reza Baqir at the State Bank in Karachi, according to a statement issued by the SBP. 
In the last week of October, Saudi Arabia had agreed to revive its financial support to Pakistan, including about $3 billion in safe deposits and $1.2bn worth of oil supplies on deferred payments. 
An agreement was reached during the visit of Prime Minister Imran Khan to the kingdom last month. 
Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry later announced that Saudi Arabia had announced the support for Pakistan with $3bn as deposit in the SBP and also financing refined petroleum product with $1.2bn during the year. 
“Under this deposit agreement, SFD shall place a deposit of USD 3 billion with SBP. The deposit amount under the agreement shall become part of SBP’s Foreign Exchange Reserves,” said the press release issued on Monday. 
However, it did not speak about the interest on $3bn while the banking sources believe the interest rate is higher than the global market.  
When the SBP was officially contacted to know the agreed rate of return on Saudi fund as there were massive speculations in financial market about the rates being given on $3bn, it stated: “As per agreement all terms are confidential and cannot be revealed without the consent of both the parties.” 
The press release further stated it would help support Pakistan’s foreign currency reserves and contribute towards resolving the adverse effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
The SBP said the deposit agreement reflected the strong and special relationship between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Pakistan and will further augment the economic ties between the two brotherly countries.  
However, the agreement for $3bn did not impact the exchange rate and the local currency further lost against US dollar to reach at an all-time low. 
The US dollar kept its demand higher during the entire session on Monday and closed at Rs176.20 as it gained 74 paisa. 
Experts in the financial market said the imports would not fall in coming months indicating that importers would keep buying dollars for protecting future trading with possible higher dollar rates. 
The inflow of remittances and foreign direct investment declined in FY22; remittance fell by $152m in October compared to inflows in September FY22 and the FDI fell by 12 per cent during July-October period of the current financial year. 
Meanwhile, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance Shaukat Tarin briefed Prime Minister Imran Khan on the progress on revenue receipts, financial assistance from Saudi Arabia as well as the oil facility on deferred payments, adds APP. 
During the meeting, matters relating to the dividends paid by the public sector enterprises also came under discussion.

2,Court seeks AGP’s help in ex-CJP’s tape case,ISLAMABAD: The Islam­abad High Court (IHC) on Monday sought the attorney general of Pakistan’s assistance in...,"ISLAMABAD: The Islam­abad High Court (IHC) on Monday sought the attorney general of Pakistan’s assistance in deciding about the maintainability of a petition seeking a probe into allegations about former chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) Saqib Nisar’s interference in the judicial proceedings related to PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz.  
The petition has been jointly filed by Salahuddin Ahmed, president of the Sindh High Court Bar Association, and Syed Haider Imam Rizvi, member of the Judicial Commission (Sindh).  
Referring to an audio clip in which Saqib Nisar is purportedly talking about conviction of Mr Sharif and Ms Nawaz, Mr Ahmed said that the leaked audio gave an impression that the judiciary was not independent in Pakistan as judicial orders were dictated by certain quarters.  
Mr Ahmed said that the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) had passed a resolution on the issue which the court might consider and issue a notice to the PBC.  
He requested the court to appoint an independent commission to probe this matter.  
IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah pointed out that apparently the audio was recorded when Saqib Nisar was the CJP.  
He then asked the petitioner who had the capability to record an audio of serving chief justice of Pakistan? “And who released the audio clip, the one who recorded it or someone living in the United States?”  
If the court presumed the audio tape genuine, who would produce the original audio? Justice Minallah asked. He added that this would set a precedent and people would approach the court for investigations into such audio clips available on social media and it would open a floodgate.  
The audio clip was related to a pending appeal in the IHC but the appellant seemed not interested to bring the matter in the court, Justice Minallah observed.  
The court issued pre-admission notice to Attorney General Khalid Jawed Khan for next week.  
The petition says a “series of events that have taken place tend to erode the credibility, reputation and independence of the judiciary in the eyes of the people”.  
The first event mentioned in the petition is a letter dated April 28, 2017 written by the then chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan Zafar Hijazi to the Supreme Court’s registrar following a telephonic conversation with the SC registrar in which the former was told to expect a Whatsapp call regarding appointment of Bilal Rasool as a member of the joint investigation team which was probing the Sharif family’s assets.  
The second event is the speech of former justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui to the Rawalpindi Bar Association on July 21, 2018 in which he accused the country’s premier intelligence agency of “manipulating judicial proceedings and that the Chief Justice of Islamabad High Court had accepted ISI instructions regarding constitution of benches to hear cases involving the former premier Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz”.  
The third event is the press conference of Maryam Nawaz of July 6, 2019 in which she released a video of former judge of Accountability Court Arshad Malik in which he confessed to have convicted Nawaz Sharif under duress.  
The fourth event is the affidavit of former chief judge of Gilgit-Baltistan which surfaced on Nov 15, 2021 in the media and accused former CJP Nisar of asking an IHC judge “that Mian Mohammad Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz Sharif must not be released on bail before the general elections at any cost.”  
The fifth event described in the petition is the alleged audio of Saqib Nisar that went viral on social media on Nov 20 in which the former CJP is talking about conviction of Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz.  
According to the petition, these events have undermined public confidence in the judiciary and damaged its reputation for independence and neutrality in the eyes of general public.

3,"A convict was invited to moot attended by judges, deplores PM Imran","Fears another blasphemous attempt in West, calls for calculated response from Muslim world.","ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan again lamented on Monday that former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who was convicted by the Supreme Court in the Panama Papers case, was invited as chief guest at a recent conference in which judges of the apex courts were also present.  
The prime minister feared that another blasphemous attempt would be made by the West against Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) and said this time a well-calculated and unanimous response should come from the Muslims so that the false impression could not come to the fore that the Muslims were against freedom of expression.  
He accepted that the government was acting “quite slowly” and that was the reason the prime minister university, which he had dreamt three years ago, could not start functioning even today.  

Fears another blasphemous attempt in West, calls for calculated response from Muslim world     

“A new culture has developed in the country in which thieves are not treated as thieves. We have seen that at a recent conference at Lahore, to which judges of the Supreme Court were invited, the chief guest was the person who had been convicted by the apex court,” Mr Khan said in his speech after inaugurating an academic block of the newly established Al-Qadir University at Sohawa tehsil of Jhelum district, while referring to self-exiled former prime minister Nawaz Sharif who had delivered a speech at Asma Jahangir Conference as a chief guest.  
Without naming Mr Sharif, the prime minister said: “The chief guest was the persons who had plundered public wealth and fled abroad on fake grounds.  
“The moral fabric of a nation gets ruined if it stops recognising corruption and dishonesty as evils,” he added.  
Mr Khan said he wanted the nation to attain a “moral renaissance” and raise leaders having a high moral character in line with the Seerat of the Holy Prophet (PBUH).  
About any future incident of blasphemy against the Holy Prophet (PBUH), he said he would encourage the nation to rather demonstrate an “intellectual and reasoned response”. “In case of any such incident in future we will consult Muslim scholars and head of Muslim states to give such a response which will not be called an attempt against freedom of expression,” he added.  
The prime minister stressed the need for reviving the culture of glorious Muslim era where religion and science did not come into conflict, and that encouraged ‘Ijtehad’ (reasoning) to find solutions to emerging challenges.  
He said today’s youth was facing confusion in the era of social media that provided unhindered access to western culture. However, he said, since restrictions could not be imposed on the flow of information, it was important to give informed choices to the youth by telling them about right and wrong.  
“Calling someone Kafir (infidel) over difference of opinion on religious beliefs is a dangerous trend, that needs to be shunned through intellectual debate,” he added.  
He expressed satisfaction over the pace of academic work attained by the Al Qadir University in a short span of time and called for conducting research on the golden era of Muslims when their leaders, scholars, and scientists ruled the world.  
Prime Minister Khan said he was also establishing a “top-tech PM university” but due to slow governmental procedure the varsity could not start its function. “The government works so slowly that after three years of conceiving the concept of the university, we are now going to start it,” he added.  
Mr Khan said universities had a great role to play and expressed confidence that the Al Qadir University would revive the norms of research and healthy debate.  
He said all Sufi saints of the sub-continent including Baba Bulleh Shah, Nizamuddin Aulia, Data Ganj Bakhsh and Baba Farid, propagated the message of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) that focused on the love for humanity.  
He said a leader had four qualities: truthfulness, justice, courage and selflessness.  
Later, the prime minister took a round of different academic blocks of the university and interacted with the faculty.  
Our correspondent in Gujar Khan adds: The prime minister said there was time in 60s when Pakistan was seen as a country that was progressing fastest in the region and Pakistanis were respected all over the world.  
“I have seen Pakistan through its different phases. There was a time when the US president personally received Pakistani president at the airport and remarkable welcome was given to our president in Britain during the 1960s because our country was progressing rapidly, and it was predicted that Pakistan was going to be California of Asia. And then we also saw the decline our country,” he said.  
Meeting on agriculture
Chairing a meeting on agriculture, Prime Minister Khan was apprised that as due measures had been taken against hoarding, the price of fertiliser had registered an average decrease of Rs400 per bag.  
The chief secretary of Punjab told the meeting that a number of steps had been taken since Nov 13 to curb hoarding of fertilisers, including registration of 347 first information reports, 244 arrests, 21,111 inspections, sealing of 480 godowns, and imposition of fines of Rs27.9 million.  
Besides, he said a control room had been established in every district to receive complaints about fertilisers’ shortage, hoarding and profiteering. Check-posts have also been established to curb inter-provincial transportation of fertilisers.  
The meeting was told that the laws relating to hoarding and profiteering were being amended under which a person giving information about the hoarding would be rewarded in proportion to the confiscated goods.  
The prime minister directed the authorities to continue to take legal action against the elements involved in hoarding and profiteering.

4,Audit finds massive irregularities in Covid spending,"Apart from financial misappropriations, USC officials procured food items unfit for human consumption.","ISLAMABAD: An audit report on Covid-19 expenditures has pointed out irregularities of up to Rs5.24 billion in purchases of sugar, ghee and wheat flour by the Utility Stores Corporation (USC), including procurement of unfit ghee and edible oil worth Rs1.40bn.
The report on “expenditures incurred on Covid-19 by federal government” released by the finance ministry has pointed out irregularities in government interventions to ensure availability of five essential items — sugar, wheat flour, oil and ghee, pulses and rice — in Utility Stores at subsidised rates.  
The audit report has highlighted that apart from financial misappropriations and irregularities, the relevant officers at the USC procured spurious food items that have been graded unfit for human consumption by the Punjab Food Authority and other quality standard authorities.  

Apart from financial misappropriations, USC officials procured food items unfit for human consumption 

Following the outbreak of Covid-19 in the country, the government had launched the Prime Minister’s Relief Package in 2020 and Rs10bn was released to the USC in March that year to provide food items at subsidised rates to the vulnerable section of society. Earlier, the government had also released Rs21bn between December 2019 and March 2020 for procurement of five essential items through 3,989 outlets of retail utility stores.  
The audit report has highlighted irregular procurement of ghee and cooking oil worth Rs1.60bn, as it was completed without competitive tendering process and obtaining competitive rates. Besides, it added, ghee and oil worth Rs1.40bn placed at the shelves of USC retail outlets had been declared unfit for human consumption by the Punjab Food Authority.  
The audit report stated that except for the Sukkur region where food items from 11 out of 15 vendors were tested from any laboratory, the USC management neither itself tested the quality of the commodities purchased nor were the quality and safety parameters ensured from the venders. “Additionally, as per USC manual, no product can be placed in shelf at any outlet unless provision of PSQCA (Pakistan Standards and Quality Control Authority) certificate and ISO certificate by the manufacturer concerned,” it added.  
The audit report has recommended that the matter may be investigated to fix responsibility for violation of PPRA (Public Procurement Regulatory Authority) rules as well as purchase and sale of substandard ghee/oil without fitness certificates.  
Similarly, it said, the USC had failed to obtain lab test reports resulting in doubtful payments against substandard wheat flour and excess payments. “The regional managers, USC, accepted atta (wheat flour) and made payment amounting Rs1.67bn during 2019-20 to flour mills without ensuring the prescribed specification of atta.”  
The report highlighted that the USC regional mangers failed to get lab reports from the Punjab Food Laboratory and any other laboratory, which was a violation of government’s instructions. Other violations included procurement of 119,110 bags (20kg) of wheat flour valuing Rs95.28 million from January to August 2020, without conducting the bidding process.  
According to the report, the USC faced a loss of Rs322.80m due to non-observance of prescribed flour specifications as its officials ignored the standard for maximum moisture contents in flour from 12 per cent and raised it to 14pc, while the ash contents ratio was increased from 2pc to 2.5pc.  
The USC also made Rs77.12m irregular business contracts with blacklisted flour mills and allocated excess wheat quota to the flour mills of choice, leading to a financial loss of Rs60.30m.  
The audit report has also highlighted a loss of Rs1.37bn due to irregular and ill-planned procurement of sugar. The procurement through tender was made at Rs65.90 per kg in November 2019, while the purchase was made in April 2020 at the rate of Rs78.32. The USC made payments worth Rs237.33m for transport of sugar without verifying toll tax and weighbridge receipts from the point of origin to the destination.  
Other irregularities by the USC include non-replacement of expired and unsalable stocks worth Rs28.34m by the vendors and the irregular arrangement of local transport without advertisement amounting to Rs46.87m.
