0,Crisis brewing in schools as teachers in Islamabad go on strike from today,"Move to hand over management of elementary, secondary schools to local govt is anti-education, teachers say.","ISLAMABAD: The federal government is going to face an educational crisis as teachers in Islamabad have decided to suspend academic activities in schools from Tuesday (today) for an indefinite period against the proposed placement of public sector schools under the yet-to-be formed local government.
The federal government recently promulgated an ordinance under which the local government will be responsible for management of primary, elementary and secondary schools. Moreover, the director general of the Federal Directorate of Education (FDE) will be reporting to the mayor of Islamabad. The ordinance also said the head of the FDE shall be appointed with the consent of the mayor.
Until last week, the FDE regulate all the 423 schools and colleges in Islamabad. However, two days before the approval of the ordinance the ministry of education issued a notification placing all the 33 colleges under the administrative control of the Federal College of Education H-9, which is a subordinate organisation of the ministry.
The notification said the 33 colleges will remain part of the education ministry but the 390 schools could be devolved to the local government under the ordinance.
Schoolteachers and other staff protested the move, terming it an anti-education step. They formed an action committee, headed by a school principal Fazal-i-Mola, which decided that from Tuesday there will be no educational activities.

Move to hand over management of elementary, secondary schools to local govt is anti-education, representatives say

School Teachers’ Association President Malik Ameer told Dawn that from Tuesday all schools will observe strike and no academic activity will take place. He said teachers will also take to the streets against the decision.
“We are employees of the federal government and don’t want to serve in a corporation. After devolution of education to provinces under the 18th amendment, the federal education ministry was formed to look after affairs of colleges and schools in Islamabad. So we should remain under the ministry,” he said 
Ameer added that the ministry had placed the 33 colleges under the Education College. Many of the colleges also have schools but they have been shifted to the Education College to keep them part of the education ministry.
“This is a sheer discrimination against other schools,” he said.
About the government assurance that their job status of federal government servants will not be changed, he said: “The ordinance is very clear and states that the mayor will be the administrative head of secondary schools.” If the government wants to resolve the issue it should make an amendment to the ordinance.
He said the performance of the last local government, which completed its five-year term in February, was unsatisfactory and the mayor, deputy mayors and chairmen of union councils and other representatives despite their best efforts could not get even their own honorarium and offices.
“So how can they ensure our salaries and other perks,” he added.
Meanwhile, a delegation of Federal Government College Teachers Association headed by its president Dr Rahima Rehman, who hailed the education ministry’s decision to place the colleges under the Education College H-9, held a meeting with the additional secretary of education and other officers.
Following the meeting, the ministry issued a press release stating that the representatives of teacher associations met the officials regarding their concerns after the promulgation of the ordinance.
The representatives expressed their concerns against devolution of the education department as this is likely to impact their service structure, including security of service.
They said it is also likely to impact adversely various service benefits and related perks. They were also apprehensive of loss of loan and housing facilities as the local government may not be able to protect their potential financial privileges.
They were also fearful of political interference in the affairs of the institutions.
The ministry addressed their concerns by assuring them that the ordinance has been recently enacted and there was a considerable transition period to implement the plan. They were assured that all their existing service structures and benefits will remain protected. They were also assured of ministry’s full assistance during the transition period so that the matters are resolved amicably in a manner that it doesn’t adversely impact their service structures.
The ministry showed its commitment that the main stakeholders, including teaching staff and other employees, will be kept engaged in all matters relating to their service conditions during the transition.

Four days after the CDA board approved award of the contract to a government-owned company, the authority on Monday conducted a competition between Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) and the NLC and found the latter’s bid of Rs10.2 billion to be the lowest against the Rs10.9 submitted by FWO.
“After completing codal formalities, we will award the contract to NLC,” said an official of the CDA, adding the authority had invited two other government-owned organisations — Railcop and National Construction Company — but they did not participate.
According to CDA officials, 10th Avenue will be constructed in two phases. In the first phase, a five-km road will be constructed from I.J. Principal Road/Katarian Bridge to Srinagar Highway near the edge of G-9 and the starting point of G-10. Once started, work on the project will be completed in 21 months.
The officials said that in future the second phase will be constructed from Srinagar Highway to Margalla Road.
On Wednesday, Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) approved the construction of 10th Avenue from I.J.P Road to Srinagar Highway at a total cost of Rs12.1 billion.
NLC is already executing two major construction projects of CDA: 7th Avenue Interchange and widening and overhauling of I.J.P Road. Work on the two projects is in progress. The FWO is executing the Margalla Road project.
Sources in the CDA said that in a bid to avoid controversies related to the award of contracts, the CDA’s management was focusing on awarding major contracts to government organisations.
“These two companies (FWO and NLC) have full capacity to complete the projects within the deadline. In the past, several projects saw delay due to contractors’ delaying tactics, so now we are hopeful that all the major contracts will be completed well on time,” said an official.

11,Cracks appear in PML-N’s AJK chapter,Three leaders of PML-N's AJK chapter had overturned the nominations of some US-based party workers for overseas party offices.,"MUZAFFARABAD: Three senior leaders of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) chapter of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) on Monday overturned the nominations of some United States-based PML-N workers for overseas party offices, made by party’s regional president Raja Farooq Haider, terming them “unnecessary and unconstitutional”.
On Saturday, a ‘notification’ on the letterhead of PML-N AJK chapter was circulated on social media, stating that party president Haider had accorded approval to the nomination of Malik Abid Hussain of district Bhimber, currently settled in Dallas, USA, as head of the PML-N body for North America and had directed him to accomplish the remaining organisational setup.
Mr Haider is currently on a private tour to the US along with PML-N legislator Ahmed Raza Qadri.
The ‘notification’ carried signatures of not only Mr Haider but also of Shah Ghulam Qadir, the regional secretary-general.
However, Mr Qadir immediately took to Twitter to distance himself from the move.
“I have no connection with the notification.... Neither was any consultation held with me nor was I taken into confidence in this regard. Our stance after the [AJK] general elections is that there should be re-organisation of the party and the central leadership is aware of it,” he tweeted.
According to PML-N sources, PML-N’s central senior vice president Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and secretary general Ahsan Iqbal had attended a meeting in Kashmir House on July 29 to discuss the election debacle and future line of action.
A follow-up meeting presided over by Mr Haider was held on July 31. Its participants included senior vice president Chaudhry Tariq Farooq, chief organiser Mushtaq Minhas, vice presidents Dr Najeeb Naqi and Chaudhry Mohammad Aziz, additional secretary general Abdul Khaliq Wasi and coordination secretary Zulfiqar Malik.
The meeting had decided that all organisations and wings of PML-N AJK, including those in the 12 constituencies in Pakistan and abroad, would be dissolved to pave the way for fresh [party] elections.
It was also decided that new bodies would be constituted at constituency, polling station/ward, union council, district and division level within two months.
The decisions were conveyed to both Nawaz Sharif and Shehbaz Sharif in writing after the meeting at the party’s letterhead with signatures of all seven participants.
However, while reservations about the first nomination were not enough, Mr Haider made two more nominations in the North America chapter late on Sunday evening, in a move that brought the serious differences within the PML-N ranks on this issue into the open.
In their response on the party letterhead on Monday, Mr Farooq, Mr Minhas and Mr Qadir asserted that the “nominations were not only in contravention of a consensus on re-organisation but had also caused irreparable damage to the party’s goodwill.”
Prior to any decision by the party’s central leadership new nominations were “inappropriate,” they said.
They recalled that last year it was decided that any ‘inevitable’ organisational set up would be made through Mr Minhas after Mr Haider himself got him elevated as chief organiser.
However, not only this was avoided in the recent nominations, the secretary general had also been bypassed in the issuance of notifications.
“Therefore, all nominations should be deemed revoked from the date of issuance for being uncalled for and unconstitutional. We also condemn attempts to create grouping within the party,” they declared.
