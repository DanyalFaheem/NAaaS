1,Ready for Rangnick: Sancho helps United draw at Chelsea,"LONDON: The cautious game plan, with Cristiano Ronaldo dropped to the bench, worked for Manchester United.  

...","LONDON: The cautious game plan, with Cristiano Ronaldo dropped to the bench, worked for Manchester United.  
Hitting Premier League leaders Chelsea on the counterattack, with Jadon Sancho scoring his first Premier League goal, and grabbing a point is the type of damage limitation-mode United are in this season.  
Snatching a 1-1 draw on Sunday after home humiliations to Liverpool and Manchester City in the fading embers of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s reign gives Ralf Rangnick a platform to build on. 
The German was named as interim manager until the end of the season on Monday, eight days after Solskjaer was removed. 
Rangnick is a pioneer of the high-intensity pressing game developed in Germany and increasingly dominant across the world over the last decade, so his arrival at Old Trafford for his first job in English football should shake up the playing style of United as the record 20-time English champions looks to rescue their season. 
United’s former midfielder Michael Carrick, one of Solskjaer’s assistants, had taken charge of the team for their Champions League victory at Villarreal last Tuesday, and oversaw the draw with Chelsea. Carrick will remain in charge of the first team until Rangnick’s work visa is finalised. 
The disappointment for United will be not holding onto the lead after Aaron Wan-Bissaka caught the back of Thiago Silva’s heel when clearing the ball. Jorginho equalised from a penalty in the 69th minute. 
Jorginho had been at fault for the United goal in the 50th minute. Miscontrolling a clearance from United midfielder Bruno Fernandes’ hooked long ball allowed Sancho to seize possession. The 21-year-old forward had the space to race through on goal before slipping a shot past goalkeeper Edouard Mendy that crept inside the right post.  
Sancho, who joined in July for 85 million euros (then $100 million), also netted in the win at Villarreal.  
Now another positive result after losing five of its last seven league games under Solskjaer has taken United to within five points of West Ham United in the fourth Champions League qualification place. 
Not that Carrick, who took the bold decision to leave Cristiano Ronaldo on the bench, was delighted with the performance. 
“Disappointed actually,” Carrick told Sky Sports. “When you are in front in a game like this to have it taken away is disappointing. I don’t think it was a penalty at all...I am not getting carried away but I thought we defended well. I cannot fault the boys one bit.” 
Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel, whose side’s lead at the top of the table was cut to one point, said: “I am happy, absolutely happy. I saw a huge effort. We put the pressure up high, we were brave and courageous.”

The young Brazilian forward had just scored another decisive goal for Real Madrid. His beautiful late strike sealed a 2-1 come-from-behind win over Sevilla on Sunday in a match between two of the best teams in Spain at the moment.
Vinicius neatly controlled the ball with his chest by the sideline before making a run past a couple of defenders. He fired a well-placed shot into the top corner from outside the area for an 87th-minute winner which delighted Real fans at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium. 
It was the second goal in the last three matches for Vinicius, and the 11th in total in what has been his best season by far since joining Real. He has already scored more goals now than in his previous three seasons in total. 
“He is extraordinary. He has something special on his feet,” Real coach Carlo Ancelotti said. “This is another step for him to become one of the best players in the world.” 
Karim Benzema, another red-hot player for Madrid, also scored to give the league leaders a four-point advantage at the top over defending champions Atletico Madrid, who won 4-1 at Cadiz. Real Sociedad dropped to third after losing 1-0 at Espanyol, while Sevilla stayed fourth, five points off the lead. Betis are fifth, a point behind Sevilla after a 3-1 win over last-placed Levante. 
Sevilla, who had been unbeaten in six consecutive league games, opened the scoring with a header by Rafa Mir in the 12th. Benzema equalised from close range after a blunder by Sevilla goalkeeper Bono in the 32nd. 
Real goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois came up with a big save in stoppage time to guarantee the win for the hosts and keep Sevilla winless on the road against Real since 2008. 
Atletico blew away Cadiz, with Diego Simeone’s side scoring all four of their goals in the second half. 
Thomas Lemar began the scoring in the 56th minute before Antoine Greizmann and Angel Correa put Atletico out of sight. Jan Oblak’s own-goal pulled a goal back for Cadiz but Matheus Cunha responded immediately to add a fourth for Atleti.
Victory helps lift morale after Atletico’s 1-0 defeat at home to AC Milan that leaves them with a mountain to climb to reach the Champions League last 16. Atletico look better placed in La Liga, sitting above Sociedad. 
Sociedad could have gone top for a few hours at least, but instead saw Espanyol end their 13-match unbeaten run in the league thanks to Yangel Her­rera’s late winner.

As well as Mertens, who has taken over several of Maradona’s records at Napoli, Piotr Zieliski and Fabian Ruiz also netted to help Napoli move three points clear of second-placed AC Milan, who earlier lost 3-1 at home to Sassuolo. 
It was a special night for Napoli fans as the match came three days after the one-year anniversary of Maradona’s death. Maradona led Napoli to their only Serie A titles in 1987 and 1990 and is considered a god-like figure in the southern city. 
A statue to the former Argentina player and coach was unveiled in the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona, while the players wore special shirts.
And Napoli got off to a quick start as goals from Zieliski and Mertens put them 2-0 up with less than 10 minutes on the clock. 
The second of Mertens’ goals, in the 29th minute, was a brilliant effort from the edge of the area that curled into the top left corner. It was a club record-extending 139th goal for Napoli from the Belgium forward. 
Another delightful goal from Ruiz that arrowed into the top corner from outside the area capped a memorable night for Napoli. 
Lazio, who are led by former Napoli coach Maurizio Sarri, slipped seven points below fourth place. 
Sassuolo emerged worthy winners at the San Siro earlier on Sunday after recovering from Alessio Romagnoli’s 21st-minute header through a superb Gianluca Scamacca strike, Simon Kjaer’s own goal and a solo effort from Domenico Berardi. 
Milan also finished with 10 men after Romagnoli completed a miserable afternoon by being shown a straight red card for taking out Gregoire Defrel. 
Their first home league defeat of the season after last weekend’s 4-3 loss at Fiorentina meant that city rivals Inter Milan are now only a point behind them in third, with Atalanta a further three back after beating Juventus in Turin on Sunday. 
Roma are three points behind Atalanta in fifth after Tammy Abraham’s 32nd-minute strike gave them a 1-0 win over 13th-placed Torino. 
Earlier, Andriy Shevchenko earned his first point as Genoa coach with a largely uneventful goalless draw at Udinese and Bologna won 1-0 at Spezia.

After American coach Marsch and several key players tested positive for coronavirus earlier in the week, a depleted Leipzig side were outplayed by fellow top-four hopefuls Leverkusen.
Forced to play in front of an empty stadium because of rising Covid cases in the region of Saxony, Leipzig’s second defeat in a row in the Bundesliga dropped them to eighth place. 
Leipzig, runners-up last season, are already 13 points off leaders Bayern Munich following their fifth league defeat of the campaign. 
It was Leverkusen’s second straight win and they moved back into third place on 24 points. 
Leverkusen, who have yet to lose on the road this season, had an early effort by Moussa Diaby ruled offside but went in front when Floria Wirtz powered into the box to latch on to a perfectly-timed Exequiel Palacios pass to chip the ball over the keeper. 
They added another goal in the 34th with Diaby rifling in from a cross by Jonathan Tah. 
Leipzig were toothless in attack until Andre Silva’s powerful header in the 62nd cut the deficit. 
But two minutes later Leverkusen restored their two-goal cushion when Angelino deflected Jeremie Frimpong’s shot into the Leipzig goal. 
Earlier, French defender Evan N’dicka headed the winning goal in added time to give Eintracht Frankfurt a 2-1 win over Union Berlin. Frankfurt, in 12th place, are level on 18 points with Leipzig, two points behind Union.

The Brazil forward was stretchered off in the 87th minute after twisting his left ankle under an awkward challenge from Yvann Macon. 
“Let’s recover from this,” Neymar said on his Instagram account. “Unfortunately these setbacks are part of an athletes’ life. It is what it is, let’s put our heads up high and lets go at it! I will come back better and stronger.” 
St Etienne opened the scoring against the run of play in the 23rd minute of the game played in snowy conditions. Wahbi Khazri picked out Timothee Kolodziejczak, whose shot was saved by Gianluigi Donnarumma. But the rebound fell to Denis Bouanga, who beat the Italy goalkeeper. 
The hosts, languishing in the bottom two but on the back of two straight league wins, held their own against PSG but their task was made much harder on the stroke of halftime when Kolodziejczak was sent off for tripping Mbappe, who was chasing a through ball from Angel di Maria. Brazil defender Marquinhos equalised by heading home the subsequent free kick taken by Messi. 
The second half was one-way traffic with further goals coming from Angel Di Maria on 79 minutes and centre-back Marquinhos with his second in time added on — Messi again providing inch-perfect passes. 
Still in November, the result leaves PSG on 40 points, 12 clear of second-placed Rennes, who beat Lorient 2-0 for their sixth win in seven matches. 
Olympique de Marseille are two points behind Rennes, level on points with third-place Nice with a game in hand, after beating Troyes 1-0 at the Velodrome. 
Monaco and Strasbourg drew 1-1 to trail fourth place by six points while Lyon moved into seventh place by grinding out a 1-0 win at Montpellier. 
Brest extended their winning run to four games courtesy of two goals from Jeremy Le Douaron in a 2-1 victory at Girondins Bordeaux. 
Clermont slid to a fifth successive loss as Ghislain Konan’s stoppage-time goal gave Reims a 1-0 win.

Spanish duo Marcel Granollers and Feliciano Lopez needed to win their doubles decider to send Spain through at Serbia’s expense, but Aslan Karatsev and Andrey Rublev came from a set down seal a 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 victory and top spot for Russia in Group ‘A’.
Sweden and Novak Djokovic’s Serbia took the two best runners-up spots and a place in the last eight by virtue of their better match win-loss records among the second placed sides throughout the group stages. 
The Russians, playing under the name of the Russian Tennis Federation because of sanctions against Russian sport for doping, made a bad start to the tie when the 40-year-old Lopez beat Rublev 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 in the opening singles rubber.
US Open champion Daniil Medvedev stepped up to bring the tie level with a 6-2, 7-6 (7/3) win over Pablo Carreno Busta, before the doubles decided the match. 
“We were very close but it was not enough,” said Lopez. “It is what it is and I don’t want to give excuses. We showed everyone that we are ready to compete in any conditions, even with so many issues that we went through. It’s so disappointing.” 
Russia will face Sweden in the quarter-finals. The other quarterfinals are: Italy v Croatia; Britain v Germany; and Serbia v Kazakhstan. 
Germany secured top spot in Group ‘F’ after battling to a 2-1 success over Austria, with Kevin Krawietz and Tim Puetz sealing their progress with a straight-sets victory in the final doubles decider. 
Colombia’s 2-1 victory over the United States in Turin mattered little as they finished second behind Italy in Group ‘E’, unable to grab one of the best runners-up spots, as 32-times champions the US slipped out with a whimper. 
Croatia, Kazakhstan and Britain progressed to the quarter-finals earlier on Sunday after the trio topped their respective groups, while 28-times champions Australia were knocked out. 
Britain got off to a poor start against the Czech Republic as they looked to secure top spot in Group ‘C’. 
Dan Evans’ surprise 6-2, 7-5 loss to world number 143 Tomas Machac left Britain needing to fight back to secure a second straight win and take top spot in Group C. 
But Cameron Norrie overcame a second-set blip to see off Jiri Lehecka 6-1, 2-6, 6-1, before Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski teamed up to beat Machac and Jiri Vesely 6-4, 6-2 in Innsbruck. 
Croatia just needed to win one rubber against Hungary to wrap up first place in Group ‘D’ and the 242nd-ranked Nino Serdarusic did just that in the opening match against Fabian Marozsan in Turin. 
Then the top-ranked doubles team of Mate Pavic and Nikola Mektic clinched victory over Hungary by defeating Marozsan and Peter Nagy 7-6 (8-6), 6-2 in the decisive doubles match after Zsombor Piros had upset former US Open champion Marin Cilic 4-6, 7-5, 6-4 to even it at 1-1.
Kazakhstan moved into the knockout stage by downing 2019 runners-up Canada in Madrid. 
Kazakhstan, which beat Sweden on Saturday, emerged victorious again thanks to singles wins for Mikhail Kukushkin and Alexander Bublik, over Brayden Schnur and Vasek Pospisil respectively.

Shaheen’s fourth five-wicket haul in Tests wrapped up Bangladesh’s second innings for 157 on Day 4 despite wicketkeeper-batsman Liton Das making a fighting fifty, setting Pakistan a 202-run target to win. 
Openers Abid Ali and Abdullah Shafique then helped Pakistan reach 109-0 at stumps, leaving the team needing 93 more runs on the final day.
Abid, who scored 133 in the first innings, was on 56 and debutant Abdullah was unbeaten on 53 when bad light ended play early for the fourth consecutive day. 
Bangladesh had a 44-run first-innings lead after posting 330 and then bowling Pakistan out for 286. 
“We just had a terrible last session yesterday which put us under a lot of pressure in the game,” Bangladesh coach Russell Domingo said. 
“They [Pakistan] need another 93 runs, so it will need something really special. Anything is possible in Test cricket. We have to come tomorrow morning believing we still have a chance. If we can pick up one or two wickets in the first half an hour, anything is possible.” 
Abid and Abdullah brought up their second consecutive century partnership in the match, frustrating Bangladesh bowlers for one-and-a-half sessions.
Abid completed his third half-century off 92 balls, flicking left-arm spinner Taijul Islam for three runs. 
Abdullah joined him in reaching his fifty in the next-to-last over, lofting offspinner Mehidy Hasan for the lone six of the innings, over deep mid-wicket. 
“In Test cricket, a fourth day is very crucial,” said Abdullah. “Our plan today was to restrict them for the lowest total possible so that we can easily chase it down. 
“We planned to have a good start to the chase and we are successful. We are now on course of a victory but we should still play well because the fifth day morning session could be tricky one.” 
Resuming on 39-4, Bangladesh looked down and out once they lost Mushfiqur Rahim in the first over of the day, before Liton, who struck a hundred in the first innings, hauled the hosts back to respectability with 59 off 89 balls.
Shaheen trapped Liton leg-before and then had Abu Jayed out for a duck to complete his five-wicket haul.
Off-spinner Sajid Khan, who finished with 3-33, wrapped things up by dispatching Taijul Islam.
The hosts had got off to a positive start with Mushfiqur hitting a boundary off the first ball of the morning, bowled by Hasan Ali. 
But two balls later he left a delivery that darted back in and departed for 16 after Hasan uprooted his off-stump. 
Liton joined overnight batsman Yasir Ali to prevent further collapse. 
Just when they looked ready to prosper, Shaheen’s low bouncer hit the helmet of Yasir, who retired hurt after making 36. 
Liton survived on 26 when he was given out, caught at short leg off Sajid. The replay showed that the ball only hit his pad and was going down the legside.
Sajid was rewarded for his persistence as he pinned Mehidy Hasan leg-before for 11. 
Substitute Nurul Hasan replaced Yasir after Mehidy’s dismissal and barely survived a strong caught-behind appeal just before lunch. 
Nurul heaved one to Faheem Ashraf at long-on off Sajid after the break, getting dismissed for 15.
Liton, meanwhile, played confidently to bring up his 10th half-century off 83 balls, guiding Shaheen’s delivery to backward point for a single. 
But he didn’t stay long as Shaheen had him lbw with an inswinger and then dismissed Jayed with a short ball. 
Sajid had Taijul stumped to bring an end to the Bangladesh’s innings as the hosts lost their last three wickets in six balls for no runs.

11,Oceania mini-event to decide World Cup playoff qualifier,The winner of the March 14-30 competition will face the fourth-placed team from the CONCACAF region.,"ZURICH: Oceania will stage a nine-team tournament in Qatar in March to decide which team advances to an intercontinental playoff for a spot at the World Cup finals, FIFA said on Monday. 
The winner of the March 14-30 competition will face the fourth-placed team from the CONCACAF region, which features sides from North and Central America and the Caribbean. 
Oceania does not have an automatic place at the finals. 
New Zealand were the last country from the region to qualify for the World Cup when they appeared in South Africa in 2010. They missed out on a place in Russia in 2018 after losing to Peru in a playoff. 
Cook Islands and Tonga will play for a slot in the group phase of the Oceania tournament, with the winner taking their place alongside New Zealand, Fiji, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Island, Tahiti and Vanuatu. 
The group phase draw was due to take place later on Monday. 
American Samoa and Samoa withdrew due to Covid-19 travel restrictions. 
Teams will be drawn into two groups of four with the top two advancing to the semi-finals at the end of the single round-robin phase. 
FIFA have granted the Oceania Football Confed­eration a one-day extension to the March international window, which is due to run from March 21-29, to allow teams to call up overseas-based players from the final round of group matches onwards. 
CLUB WORLD CUP IN UAE IN FEBRUARY
Also on Monday, FIFA confirmed dates for the delayed 2021 Club World Cup, with the Feb 3-12 tournament in the United Arab Emirates requiring Chelsea to postpone two Premier League games. 
The schedule was announced hours before the tournament draw was being made. 
The seven-team lineup was completed Saturday when Palmeiras won the Copa Libertadores.
Chelsea, the Champions League winners, and Palmeiras enter at the semi-finals stage and then go on to play the final or a third-place game. 
Premier League leaders Chelsea had been due to play Feb 8 at Brighton and host Arsenal on Feb 12. Those games should now be rescheduled. 
The tournament also includes African champions Al Ahly, Asian champions Al Hilal, CONCACAF Champions League winner Monterrey, Oceania champion Auckland City plus the host nation’s domestic title winner, Al Jazira. 
The Covid-19 pandemic has twice altered plans for the 2021 Club World Cup. 
It was originally to be the inaugural expanded edition in China in June and July. That launch was shelved by FIFA when the 2020 editions of the European Championship and Copa America were put back one year. 
A traditional seven-team Club World Cup was to be hosted in December by Japan, which withdrew three months ago citing likely travel restrictions in the pandemic.

12,Nissanka hits unbeaten 61 as SL make solid start after rain,Match officials extended play after the hosts won the toss but stopped half an hour early with bad light after just 34.4 overs.,"GALLE: Opening batsman Pathum Nissanka scored an unbeaten 61 to get Sri Lanka off to a good start against the West Indies after rain stopped play until after tea in the second Test at Galle on Monday as the hosts reached 113-1 at stumps. 
Match officials extended play after the hosts won the toss but stopped half an hour early with bad light after just 34.4 overs.
Nissanka, who completed his third Test half-century, and captain Dimuth Karunaratne shared 106 runs for the first wicket. 
Karunaratne, who scored 147 and 83 in the first Test, looked rusty in his 90-ball 42 before being caught and bowled by offspinner Roston Chase. Karunaratne hit six boundaries. 
Nissanka looked more fluent as his runs came off 109 deliveries. He hit a six and four boundaries. 
The West Indies exhausted two reviews, first challenging a decision after a leg-before shout against Nissanka off Jason Holder. 
They then argued for a caught behind with Oshada Fernando yet to score, but that too was unsuccessful. 
The pitch in Galle had spin and bounce on the first day but the three West Indies spinners failed to take full advantage. Chase finished the day with 1-33. 
Sri Lanka made one change to the side that won the first Test by 187 runs, leaving out fast bowler Dushmantha Chameera and beefing up their batting with Charith Asalanka, marking the former under-19 captain’s Test debut.
The West Indies brought in fast bowler Kemar Roach and spinner Veerasammy Permaul, replacing Shannon Gabriel and Rahkeem Cornwall. 
Permaul is playing his first Test in six years and will complement fellow left-arm spinner Jomel Warrican. 
Roach, the eighth highest wicket-taker for the West Indies in Test match cricket, was a surprise omission in the first Test. 
Play will get underway 15 minutes early over the next four days to catch up for lost time.

13,Vernon Philander leaves early for South Africa,The former paceman is making an early return due to flights from and to South Africa being suspended because of Omicron variant.,"LAHORE: Former South Africa pace bowler Vernon Philander, who is Pakistan team’s bowling consultant, left for his native country on Monday night from Bangladesh a couple of days before his scheduled departure, in the backdrop of the sudden new virus variant Omicron detected in his country, the Pakistan Cricket Board announced on Monday.
The 36-year-old Philander, who joined the Pakistan team for the ICC T20  World Cup was scheduled to leave for South Africa after the ongoing first Test against Bangladesh in Chittagong. But due to latest virus-related developments back in his country, flights from and to South Africa are being suspended. Therefore, the former paceman is making an early return.
As the PCB did not appoint coaches on regular basis after the resignations of Misbah-ul-Haq (head coach) and Waqar Younis (coach) last September, Philander and batting coach former Australia opener Matthew Hayden were hired in an interim arrangement.  Left-handed Hayden left the Pakistan squad soon after the T20 World Cup ended in the UAE on Nov 14.
After the resignations of Misbah and Waqar, the PCB has not yet started the process to hire permanent coaches. Therefore, current interim head coach Saqlain Mushtaq is most likely to continue to perform his duty for next month’s white-ball home series against the West Indies comprising three ODIs and as many T20 Internationals.
It is learnt that after the West Indies series, the PCB will have three months before it hosts Australia in March 2022 and during this period new appointments on these posts will be made. Some coaches working at the National High Performance Centre will assist Saqlain during the series against the West Indies.

14,No split loyalties for England-born Ashes hopeful Josh Inglis,"“As a kid growing up in England, I obviously supported England but that’s all changed now moving to Australia,” says Inglis.","GOLD COAST: Josh Inglis may have been born and raised to the age of 14 in England but the 26-year-old says there will be no split loyalties if he gets the chance to keep wickets for Australia in the upcoming Ashes series.
The fallout from the bombshell resignation of captain Tim Paine has left the hosts without a specialist wicket-keeper in the squad just over a week from the start of the series. 
The more experienced Alex Carey is also in the frame and Inglis will find out over the next couple of days whether or not he will be making his test debut in Brisbane on Dec. 8 against the team he used to support. 
“As a kid growing up in England, I obviously supported England but that’s all changed now moving to Australia,” Inglis told reporters on Monday. “Once you start building your way up in professional cricket, it’s quite hard trying to play for a team and not supporting them. That changed pretty quickly.” 
Inglis has a first class average of 34.03 in 45 matches but has not played any red ball cricket since September after being included in Australia’s squad for the Twenty20 World Cup.
He failed to get on the field at the World Cup so his candidature to replace Paine will be backed by his three centuries for Western Australia last season as well as in training for next week’s “A” match against England Lions. 
“My focus is really clear, I’m either going to be playing an ‘A’ game or a test match next week,” he added. “My focus is really clear on my red ball prep ... I’m really happy with where my game is at the moment. I’m ready to go.” 
While Carey, also uncapped but a veteran of 83 short-format internationals, pressed his case with a one-day century for South Australia at the weekend, Inglis has had the likes of Ricky Ponting, Adam Gilchrist and Shane Warne talking him up. 
“You don’t want to read too much into it because, at the end of the day, they are not the guys making the decision,” Inglis said. “But for them to say some really nice things about me is nice to hear.”

15,Ravindra-Patel rearguard snatches dramatic draw for NZ,"Chasing 284 for victory on a final day surface, New Zealand were in tatters at 155-9 with at least eight overs to go.","KANPUR: Debutant Rachin Ravindra and number 11 batsman Ajaz Patel combined in a stunning rearguard to secure New Zealand’s thrilling draw in the opening Test against India on Monday.
Chasing 284 for victory on a final day surface, New Zealand were in tatters at 155-9 with at least eight overs to go and the light steadily fading at Kanpur’s Green Park Stadium. 
Their last batting pair of Ravindra and Patel faced relentless spin from both ends with a shoal of close-in fielders around the bat but managed to survive the last 52 balls to deny India. 
“I suppose the beauty of Test cricket really, where there can be a lot of excitement,” New Zealand captain Kane Williamson said of what he called “an exciting day”.  
“Terrific game overall. All three results were still at play. We showed a lot of heart to bat through the day. Obviously when the win was out of the question, a draw is the next best option to try and fight for, and there was a lot of effort going into trying to achieve that. 
“Rachin in his first Test match and Ajaz as well showed a lot of character to bat those few overs there against high-quality, world class spin as the light was dimming.” 
After a wicketless morning session, seamer Umesh Yadav struck with the first ball after lunch to break the 76-run stand between overnight batsmen Will Somerville and Tom Latham.
Somerville had walked out as nightwatchman after Will Young’s late dismissal on Sunday but played like a specialist batsman for his 36 off 110 balls. 
His dismissal opened the floodgates for India’s three-pronged spin attack. 
Ravichandran Ashwin (3-35) cut short Latham’s industrious knock of 52 and Ravindra Jadeja (4-40) dismissed veteran Ross Taylor on the stroke of tea. 
The onus was on Williamson to save the match but the New Zealand captain fell for 24, trapped leg before by a Jadeja delivery that kept low. 
Axar Patel had Henry Nicholls (1) dismissed lbw and New Zealand’s middle order put up little resistance as Ashwin bowled Tom Blundell (2). 
Kyle Jamieson (5) and Tim Southee (4) helped Ravindra eat up 11 overs before falling to Jadeja and there were just 10.4 overs remaining in the day. 
The umpires checked fading light repeatedly but play carried on as India deployed seven fielders around the bat but were still thwarted by the over-my-body defiance from Ravindra and Patel until the dramatic call-off with approximately two overs remaining. 
Ravindra faced 91 balls for his 18 not out, while Patel survived 23 balls to stay unbeaten on two. 
“Ravindra showed great composure [and] Ajaz Patel with his defence,” said Ashwin, who moved to 419 wickets past Harbhajan Singh’s 417 and became the third on India’s all-time list after Anil Kumble (619) and Kapil Dev (434). “Everybody hangs in there, everybody can defend well these days.” 
Debutant Shreyas Iyer stood out for India with his 105 and 65 in India’s 345 and 237-4 declared.
Iyer was named man of the match for his batting heroics after India won the toss and elected to bat first on a pitch that stayed low and slow but held on for five days. 
“I am really happy for Shreyas. He had to wait a long time for his Test debut. He batted really well,” said India’s stand-in captain Ajinkya Rahane. “The way he works, his record in first class cricket is really good.” 
It was the first Test between the sides since New Zealand triumphed in the World Test Championship final in June. 
India fielded a depleted squad for the match with several frontline players either rested or recuperating — including regular skipper Virat Kohli, who will return for the second and final Test which starts in Mumbai on Friday.
