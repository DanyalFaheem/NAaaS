0,Govt mulls dividends plan to cut circular debt,The government owns major stakes in big energy companies and stands to benefit directly if they announce dividends.,"KARACHI: The government is considering a scheme to reduce the stock of the circular debt by declaring dividends for the shareholders of energy sector companies. 
The government owns major stakes in big energy companies and stands to benefit directly if they announce dividends. 
According to an official statement on Monday, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance and Revenue Shaukat Tarin chaired a meeting on the issue at the Finance Division. The petroleum secretary told the meeting a low pay-out ratio and a mounting circular debt have resulted in a significant drop in the share prices of energy companies on the Pakistan Stock Exchange. Poor cash flows are affecting future growth and long-term sustainability of the listed energy companies, the statement quoted him as saying. 
Mr Tarin advised the energy companies to make the “best use of their resources” and directed the Petroleum Division to present a workable plan in the next meeting. 

Tarin assures millers sugar industry’s problems will be resolved on a priority basis

In the recent past, Mr Tarin has encouraged energy heavyweights to announce dividends and count the same towards settling the circular debt. 
By Mr Tarin’s own estimates, such a move would not only increase energy companies’ valuations on the stock market but also bring down the circular debt by Rs300-400 billion. The stock of unpaid bills within the energy value chain currently hovers around Rs2.5 trillion. 
For example, trade debts of Oil and Gas Development Company, one of the last entities in the circular debt chain, include an overdue amount of Rs322.4bn as receivables from oil refineries and gas companies. 
As for Pakistan Petroleum Ltd, another tail-end firm in the circular debt chain, trade debts include Rs260.2bn as receivables from state-controlled companies and Rs6.1bn from oil refineries. 
The finance adviser had made this suggestion in response to a speech by stockbroker-turned industrialist Arif Habib in a ceremony on Nov 14 in Karachi. In his speech, Mr Habib had noted that the index was trading at (2022) forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 4.9 versus the historical average of 8.1. 
An indicator of how much investors are willing to pay for each rupee in earnings, the prevailing P/E multiple suggests stock values are suppressed, particularly because of cash-flow restraints in index heavyweight energy companies. 
Mentioning the benefits of announcing dividends and adjusting them against the outstanding circular debt, Mr Tarin also referred to the global depositary receipts or GDRs, which are instruments to raise capital by listing local companies on foreign stock exchanges. Declaring dividends will improve valuations of energy companies and enable the government to raise funds internationally by issuing GDRs, he had said. 
APP adds: Meanwhile, in a meeting with a delegation of Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA) on Monday, Mr Tarin said the government appreciated the critical role of the sugar industry in the country’s economic progress and would resolve its problems on a priority basis. 
He listened to all delegation members keenly and issued orders for the resolution of their problems. 
The PSMA delegation apprised the meeting of the issues facing the sugar industry. Mr Tarin reiterated the government’s commitment to address genuine concerns of the industry.

1,"Ministry concedes economy faces inflationary, external pressures",Financial and economic support from friendly countries will ease out the pressure on the external sector.,"ISLAMABAD: The government on Monday conceded that Pakistan economy was confronted with pressures on inflation and the external sector mainly because of currency depreciation, macroeconomic policies and external factors.
“External pressures have begun to materialise mostly due to the compound impacts of increased economic activity, an expansionary macroeconomic policy mix, and rising international commodity prices”, said Economic Adviser’s Wing (EAW) of the Ministry of Finance in its Monthly Economic Update & Outlook.
In its November Update, the EAW explained that Pakistan’s inflation was driven by the demand factors, international commodity prices, exchange rate, seasonal factors and economic agents’ expectations concerning the future developments of these indicators.

Uptrend in agriculture, industrial sectors to help achieve growth target

It said the year-on-year inflation had accelerated in the last two months, but this may be moderated by the seasonal profile while financial and economic support from friendly countries will ease out pressure on the external sector. 
The government’s efforts to monitor the functioning of the retail markets especially in essential food products is ongoing and is being strengthened to counter the inflationary pressures, the report claimed.
The report noted that exports of goods and services recorded approximately $3 billion in October and expected the exports would keep rising in the coming months, helped by the momentum in domestic economic dynamism, and specific government policies to stimulate exports. 
It said the 0.8pc fiscal deficit recorded in first quarter (July-September 2021) was lower than last year’s 1.1pc, it would further go down with continued fiscal discipline through an effective revenue mobilisation strategy and better expenditure management.
The report said the economy was on track to achieve the growth target for FY22 as the second estimates of the cotton crop along with the latest performance of high frequency variables were encouraging and set an optimistic baseline scenario. 
During 4MFY22, the agriculture credit disbursement increased by 6.5pc to Rs381.3bn compared to Rs358bn of same period last year. The urea off-take in October was 514,000 tonnes which increased by 24.4pc over October 2020. DAP off-take also increased by 49.2pc to 342,000 tonnes in October.
The Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM) posted a growth of 5.15pc in the first quarter of FY22 against 4.53pc in the same period last year. 
During the period, 12 out of 15 sub-sectors of LSM have witnessed positive growth. The EAW expects the industrial sector to follow an upward trend and help achieve the overall growth target.

2,Move to bring over 22m individuals under tax net,Shaukat Tarin tasks the tax machinery to implement the strategy in a phase-wise manner.,"ISLAMABAD: In a large drive to widen the tax net and check evasion, the government has evolved a plan for broadening of tax base along with a documentation drive from December to bring over 22 million people under the fold. 
At a high-level meeting chaired by Adviser on Finance and Revenue Shaukat Tarin, details of the plan were discussed. The finance adviser tasked the tax machinery to implement the strategy in a phase-wise manner.    
Speaking to Dawn, a senior official said the documentation drive will begin in December with a mass media campaign to appraise people to come under the tax net on a voluntary basis. 
“People will be sensitised about the legal implication in case they did not come under the tax net. The documentation drive will assist in ascertaining untapped segments including businesses and real estate,” the official explained. “We have identified 22.2 million potential taxpayers.” 
Data of 15 million potential taxpayers was gathered from the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) while information on the remaining 7.2 million individuals was collected from various sources by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), the official shared.  
As per the proposed plan, notices will be issued to 100,000 to 300,000 individuals monthly. “We will not issue notices in bulk,” the official said, adding that these will be properly monitored and pursued at the level of regional tax offices. 
On Monday, Chairman FBR Ashfaq Ahmed and his team gave a detailed presentation on the progress of readiness for potential taxpayer outreach initiatives to boost revenue growth and resource mobilisation. 
An official announcement said the FBR chairman apprised the finance adviser that pragmatic steps had been initiated for compilation of data with the support of Nadra. The data would be available to potential and current taxpayers in a presentable and comprehensible manner through a web portal. 
Key challenges to reaching out to potential and current taxpayers, public awareness and confidence building measures taken by the FBR were also discussed in the meeting. 
Mr Tarin stressed that efficient and robust communication with the taxpayers should be at the centre of activity to harness public support for the efforts for broadening the tax base and promoting tax compliance culture in the country. 
He advised the FBR team to double down their efforts and launch the taxpayer outreach initiative at the earliest to expand the existing tax base and boost the revenue collection.

3,"No gas for CNG stations in Sindh, Balochistan from Dec 1: SSGC",Outlet owners reject the two-and-half-month closure.,"KARACHI: The Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd (SSGCL) has decided to suspend gas supply to all the compressed natural gas (CNG) stations across Sindh and Balochistan from Dec 1 (8am) to Feb 15, 2022 (10pm).
The government has approved a load management plan to make gas available to domestic and commercial customers on top priority basis during winter season.
The SSGCL, in a statement, said gas supply to all captive power plants (CPPS) of non-export industrial units was discontinued last Friday till further orders due to this winter spike. However, all general industries, zero-rated export industries including its CPPs and fertiliser sector will continue to get the gas.
The volume of gas curtailed from suspension to CPPs of non-export units and CNG sector would be diverted to domestic customers to enable them in catering their enhanced gas loads arising due to the winter season.

Outlet owners reject the two-and-half-month closure 

In Balochistan, supply of additional gas is a must for the survival of human lives since gas serves as a lifeline to a huge population that has to keep itself warm through water and space heating gas appliances in extremely low temperatures.
The SSGCL said it looks forward to the CNG sector for understanding the gravity of the situation and expects its cooperation for serving the domestic customers better, through uninterrupted gas supplies.
While rejecting the two-and-a-half months closure of outlets, the All Pakistan CNG Association (APCNGA) termed the move as an unjustified cruelty which would not be acceptable.
In a statement APCNGA leader Ghiyas Abdullah Paracha said the SSGCL did not consult stakeholders before deciding to close the CNG stations for 2.5 months. He said it was unfair to shut down the Sindh’s CNG sector, which is paying the highest price of $15 per unit for liquefied natural gas (LNG). On the other hand, the sectors which are paying just $2-6 per unit are being promoted, he added.
“The CNG sector is not only ensuring cut in the oil import bill but also helping to reduce urban pollution as compared to other fuels. This environment-friendly fuel facilitates transportation to the poor, but it is subjected to frequent tariff and tax hikes,” he lamented.
Mr Paracha also said that gas utilities cut off gas supply to the CNG sector whenever they want which affects the employment and business of millions of people. 
APCNGA Senior Vice-President  Shoaib Khanjee said the gas consumption by over 600 CNG stations in Sindh had plummeted to 13mmcfd from 85-90mmcfd in mid 2020 due to profiling by the utility company from 10pm to 6am. “We are worried over massive unemployment of thousands of people associated directly and indirectly with CNG business,” he feared. 
Meanwhile, Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry President Mian Nasser Hyatt Magoo on Monday urged the government to take effective measures to ensure uninterrupted gas supply to industries as well as reduce electricity tariffs. 
Slamming the federal government’s gas suspension decision, Sindh Energy Minister Imtiaz Sheikh said it was a cruel and unjust step which would increase the unemployment in the province rendering thousands of people jobless. 
Mr Imtiaz said that the federal government was constantly victimising the province that produces most of the gas in the country. “Gas should be supplied to Sindh in a fair manner under Article 158,” he asserted.

4,Yields on PIBs raised by up to 246bps,Government raises Rs117 billion against the target of Rs100bn in the auction held after the change in the monetary policy.,"KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Monday said the first auction of Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs) following an increase in the interest rate saw a jump in rates as cut-off yields were raised by up to 246 basis points.  
The government raised Rs117 billion against the target of Rs100bn in the auction held after the change in the monetary policy. The investors’ bids were Rs288bn indicating the rush for higher yielding PIBs. 
The SBP recently increa­sed the policy interest by 150 basis points to 8.75 per cent. The sudden increase was widely criticised by independent economists and analysts and the decision was assumed as the outcome of the agreement with the Inter­national Monetary Fund (IMF). The government recently completed its staff level negotiations with the IMF for the resumption of loans. The cut-off yield for three-years PIBs was increased by 246 basis points to 11.34pc while the government raised Rs25 bn. 
The cut-off yield on five-year PIBs was increased by 241 basis points to 11.59pc, with the government managing to raise Rs56.45bn. 
The cut-off yield on 10-year PIBs was increased by 196 basis points to 11.79pc and Rs35.5bn was raised by the government.  Bids for 15-years PIBs were rejected while no bids received for 20 and 30-year PIBs.  
The SBP on Monday further clarified its stance on the monetary policy decisions and said that in the midst of a once-in-a-century pandemic, it would be imprudent to solely superimpose classical economic theories onto data outturns.  
“Policymakers, economists and businesses around the world did not know how the global or domestic economy would evolve in response to mobility restrictions of varying stringencies in different locations,” the central bank said.

5,Bumper rice crop fuels hopes for record-breaking export,"Pakistan is currently exporting rice to five countries including China, Kenya, United Arab Emirates, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia.","ISLAMABAD: The country has achieved a bumper rice crop of about nine million tonnes this year signalling the potential of highest-ever export of the commodity, Minister for National Food Security and Research Syed Fakhr Imam said on Monday.  
“The country has an exportable surplus of 8.03m tonnes worth $4.85 billion. Now that shipment disruption is easing, Pakistan should make every effort to export 8.03m tonnes and earn $4.85bn which will be $2.74bn more than that of last year. This may be the highest growth in the entire export sector this year,” Mr Imam said at a news conference in Islamabad. 
He said the country is achieving record production of rice due to its policies for the past three years. Last year, Pakistan produced 8.41m tonnes of rice. By November this year, 3.1m tonnes of rice was consumed domestically and 3.34m tonnes were exported worth $2.11bn. 
“It is a notable achievement due to the government’s effective support to the farmers who must be paid a tribute for their diligence and hard work for achieving this unprecedented milestone,” Mr Imam said.  By next month, the total available stock of rice will be 11.43m tonnes, and after deducting 3.40m tonnes for domestic consumption, 8.03m tonnes remains exportable surplus, Mr Imam shared estimates.   
Currently, the average export prices of basmati and coarse rice are $870 per tonne and $490 per tonne, respectively. At these prices, Pakistan can earn $2.1bn and $2.75bn, with the total of $4.85bn from the export of basmati and coarse rice this year. 
In the fiscal year 2020-21, Pakistan exported 3.50m tonnes of rice worth $2.11bn. These rice exports were about 12 per cent lower compared to those in FY20 when Covid-19 pandemic-related disruptions hit shipments. 
Pakistan is currently exporting rice to five countries including China, Kenya, United Arab Emirates, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. “There are several other countries where there is great potential [for exports]. Pakistani embassies and high commissions should be given the task to explore this potential,” the minister said.
