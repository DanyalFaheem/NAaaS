Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama deployed an initial 50 Fijian troops to maintain law and order in the wake of deadly anti-government protests, lifting the number of peacekeepers to about 200 — mostly Australian with a contribution of at least 34 from Papua New Guinea.
Bainimarama said another 120 troops were on standby if the security situation deteriorated in Honiara, where a massive clean-up was under way after the unrest that claimed at least three lives.
“I also wish to take this moment to convey my thoughts and prayers to our brothers and sisters in Solomon Islands for the turmoil they are currently experiencing,” the Fijian leader said. The Solomons crisis erupted last on Wednesday when protests over government policies turned violent, fuelled by poverty, unemployment and inter-island rivalries in the nation of 800,000.

1,Catholic nuns lift veil on abuse in convents,"More episodes of psychological, emotional and physical abuse are coming to light.","VATICAN CITY: When young nuns at a convent in Eastern Europe told their Mother Superior that a priest had tried to molest them, she retorted that it was probably their fault for  “provoking him”.
When African nuns in Minnesota asked why it was always they who had to shovel snow, they were told it was because they were young and strong, even though white sisters of the same age lived there too.
As the Roman Catholic Church pays more attention to the closed world of convents, where women spend much of their time in prayer and household work, more episodes of psychological, emotional and physical abuse are coming to light.
A new book,  “Veil of Silence” by Salvatore Cernuzio, a journalist for the Vatican’s online outlet, Vatican News, is the latest expose to come from within and approved by authorities.
Cernuzio recounts experiences of 11 women and their struggles with an age-old system where the Mother Superior and older nuns demand total obedience, in some cases resulting in acts of cruelty and humiliation.
Marcela, a South American woman who joined an order of cloistered nuns in Italy 20 years ago when she was 19, recounts how the indoctrination was so strict that younger sisters needed permission to go to the bathroom and ask for sanitary products during their menstrual periods.
“You are always complaining! Do you want to be a saint or not?” Marcela, who later left the convent, quotes the Mother Superior as shouting when she suggested changes in the daily routine.
Therese, a French woman, was told  “you have to suffer for Jesus” when she asked to be spared physically demanding chores because of a back condition.
“I understood that we were all like dogs,” recounted Elizabeth, an Australian.  “They tell us to sit and we sit, to get up and we get up, to roll over and we roll over.”
Last year, Father Giovanni Cucci wrote a landmark article about abuse in convents in the Jesuit journal Civilta Cattolica, whose texts are approved by the Vatican.
He found that most of it was abuse of power, including episodes of racism such as in the Minnesota convent. Cucci said the problem needed more attention because it had been overshadowed by the sexual abuse of children by priests.
In 2018, the Vatican newspaper Osservatore Romano exposed the plight of foreign nuns sent by their orders to work as housekeepers for cardinals and bishops in Rome with little or no remuneration.
It later chronicled a  “burnout” syndrome, where younger women with good educations were held back by older superiors reluctant to relinquish a boot camp-style tradition of assigning them menial tasks, ostensibly to instil discipline and obedience.
“Whatever may have worked in a pyramidal, authoritarian context of relationships before is no longer desirable or liveable,” wrote Sister Nathalie Becquart, a French member of the Xaviere Missionary Sisters and one of the highest-ranking women in the Vatican.
Becquart wrote in the book’s preface of the  “cries and sufferings” of women who entered convents because they felt a calling from God but later left because their complaints too often fell on deaf ears. Some were stigmatized as  “traitors” by their orders and had great difficultly getting jobs in the outside world.

2,Russia carries out another test of hypersonic missile,"Russia, the US, France and China have all been experimenting with so-called hypersonic glide vehicles.","MOSCOW: Russia said on Monday it had carried out another successful test of its Zircon hypersonic cruise missile, as world powers race to develop the advanced weaponry.
Russia, the United States, France and China have all been experimenting with so-called hypersonic glide vehicles — defined as reaching speeds of at least Mach 5.
As part of  “the completion of tests” of Russia’s hypersonic missile weapons, the Admiral Gorshkov warship launched a Zircon missile at a target in the Barents Sea at a range of 400 kilometres (about 250 miles), the defence ministry said.
“The target was hit,” the ministry said, describing the test as successful.
The missile has undergone a number of recent tests, with Russia planning to equip both warships and submarines with the Zircon.
Putin revealed the development of the new weapon in a state of the nation address in February 2019, saying it could hit targets at sea and on land with a range of 1,000 kilometres (about 620 miles) and a speed of Mach 9.
Russia’s latest Zircon test came after Western reports that a Chinese hypersonic glider test flight in July culminated in the mid-flight firing of a missile at more than five times the speed of sound over the South China Sea.
Up until the test, none of the top powers had displayed comparable mastery of a mid-flight missile launch.
China denied the report, saying it was a routine test of a reusable space vehicle.
Russia has boasted of developing several weapons that circumvent existing defence systems, including the Sarmat intercontinental missiles and Burevestnik cruise missiles.
Western experts have linked a deadly blast at a test site in northern Russia in 2019 — which caused a sharp spike in local radiation levels — to the Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile.

3,WHO flags global risk  from Omicron as states tighten restrictions,The emergence of Omicron has revived worries about the economic recovery from the two-year pandemic.,"GENEVA: The WHO said on Monday the Omicron coronavirus variant carried a very high risk of infection surges as more countries closed their borders and reported cases of the new strain.
The emergence of Omicron has also revived worries about the economic recovery from the two-year pandemic. Battered stocks and oil prices recovered somewhat after a day of panic last week, however, as hopes grew that the variant might prove to be milder than initially feared.
The World Health Organisation advised its 194 member nations that any surge in infections could have severe consequences, but said no deaths had been linked to the new variant.
An infectious disease expert from South Africa, where scientists first identified Omicron last week, said it was too early to say whether symptoms were more severe than previous variants, but it did appear to be more transmissible.
Professor Salim Abdool Karim also said existing Covid-19 vaccines are probably effective at stopping Omicron from causing severe illness. Scientists have said it could take weeks to understand the severity of Omicron.
Fears the new variant might be resistant to vaccines helped wipe roughly $2 trillion off global stock markets on Friday but markets settled down again on Monday, even after Japan said it would close its borders to foreigners.
Other countries also imposed travel and other restrictions, worried that Omicron could spread fast even among people with immunity from vaccination or prior infection.
Travellers stranded at Johannesburg international airport said they felt  “helpless” as flights from South Africa were cancelled.
“We don’t know what to do, we are just waiting here, we don’t know how they will help, but they just told us they can’t help us,” said Ntabiseng Kabeli, a stranded passenger from Lesotho.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Omicron’s emergence showed how  “perilous and precarious” the situation was.
Portugal found 13 cases of the variant at a Lisbon football club. Scotland and Austria also reported their first cases. Japan described its ban on arrivals by foreigners as precautionary.
“These are temporary, exceptional measures that we are taking for safety’s sake, until there is clearer information about the Omicron variant,” Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said.

4,Macau casino shares tumble amid arrests; junket mogul detained,"HONG KONG: Macau casino stocks slid on Monday, rattled by the arrests of 11 people over alleged links to ...","HONG KONG: Macau casino stocks slid on Monday, rattled by the arrests of 11 people over alleged links to cross-border gambling and money laundering, with the founder of the gaming hub’s biggest junket operator among those detained.
Shares in MGM China plunged 10pc, while Wynn Macau lost 7.8pc and Sands China fell 5.3pc as investors fretted about the near-term potential loss of business as well as the longer-term implications of the watershed hardline stance being taken towards the sector by authorities in Macau and mainland China.
Alvin Chau, the founder of Suncity — a junket operator that brings in high rollers to play at casinos, extending them credit and collecting on their debts — as well as the CEO of gambling sector investment firm Suncity Group Holdings, was among those arrested, Macau broadcaster TDM reported.
Macau authorities have previously said police were questioning a 47-year-old businessman surnamed Chau, without elaborating on his identity.
On Friday authorities in Wenzhou, a city in eastern China, issued an arrest warrant for Alvin Chau, accusing him of operating gambling activities in mainland China where gambling is illegal.
“Suncity accounts for over 50pc of junket revenue (in Macau), which accounts for roughly 50pc of gaming revenues, so Suncity accounts for 25pc of gaming revenues,” said Carlos Lobo, a Macau-based gaming consultant.
“The impact on the gambling industry is huge ... But (Suncity) is no longer too big to fail, the system will not collapse.”  Suncity Group Holdings did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Macau police said on Sunday the 11 people arrested had admitted some allegations, including establishing overseas gambling platforms and conducting illegal virtual betting activities, but had declined to cooperate on other issues.
Wenzhou authorities have accused Chau of forming a junket agent network on the mainland to help citizens engage in offshore and cross-border gambling activities as well as setting up an asset management company on the mainland to help gamblers make cross-border fund transfers.
The tougher stance — which comes amid a broad regulatory clampdown in China on a range of sectors including tech and property — signals a new era for gambling in Macau and its relationship with mainland China, said Ben Lee, founder of Macau gaming consultancy IGamiX.
“It means that China will no longer tolerate Macau promoting in any form or manner gambling into the mainland,” he said.
He added that authorities, having learnt they could control the flow of visitors into Macau with the advent of Covid-19 border controls, had now moved on to controlling the type of visitors and that the special administrative region would now have to rely on mass-market gamblers instead of high-rollers.
Casino operators in the former Portuguese colony have recorded historic losses since the onset of the pandemic as China’s quarantine requirements have made it too costly for most mainland tourists to travel there.
The Macau units for US casino operators Sands, MGM and Wynn each saw revenue plummet roughly 80pc last year and the sector will also now have to contend with the potential threat to tourism posed by the new coronavirus variant Omicron.
Shares in Suncity Group, which has a market valuation of HK$1.7 billion ($220 million), were suspended from trade on Monday after tumbling 165pc so far this year.
Before the Covid-19 pandemic, Macau’s government obtained more than 80pc of its tax revenues from the gambling industry, which employed about three-quarters of the territory’s 600,000 population, either directly or indirectly.

Today the endangered species has bounced back and a herd of about 80 of the graceful animals roam a small nature reserve within Israel’s biggest city, the Gazelle Valley Park.
Created six years ago by Jerusalem City Council and the Society for the Protection of Nature (SPN), the green oasis sits inside one of the city’s most dense urban development areas.
Today the park, which can be visited free of charge, is the only one in Israel where gazelles live protected — a sanctuary badly needed by a species under intense pressure.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature placed the mountain gazelle on its Red List in 2017, saying its population was declining due to poaching, road kills and habitat degradation.
“We place the gazelles in as natural an environment as possible, so that we don’t make them dependent on humans and so that we can release some of them into the wild in the future,” said park director Yael Hammerman-Solar.
Endemic to the Levant, the population of mountain gazelles in Israel is now estimated at about 5,000, but falling due to urbanisation and other pressures, said a recent study by Yoram Yom-Tov of Tel Aviv University and Uri Roll of Ben Gurion University in Beersheva.
In Jerusalem several years ago, the construction of a ring road suddenly  “blocked the corridor that allowed the gazelles to reach other open spaces outside Jerusalem,” said Hammerman-Solar.

6,Lebanese protesters block roads over economic misery,Lebanon’s economic crisis has propelled more than three-quarters of the population into poverty.,"BEIRUT: Demons­trators, some of them burning tyres, blocked roads across parts of Lebanon on Monday in protest at the country’s economic meltdown, days after the Lebanese pound sank to new lows.
Lebanon’s economic crisis, which erupted in 2019, has propelled more than three quarters of the population into poverty and the local currency has plummeted by over 90pc.
The Lebanese pound sank to more than 25,000 against the dollar last week, from a peg in 2019 of 1,500.
Roads were blocked by burning tyres in central Beirut, Tripoli in northern Lebanon and the southern city of Sidon.
There has been little progress since Prime Minister Najib Mikati’s government was appointed in September after more than a year of political deadlock that compounded the crisis.
Mikati’s government has been in paralysis since a row over the lead investigator into a fatal explosion at Beirut port last year flared during a cabinet meeting on Oct 12. The cabinet has not met since then.
Subsidies have been cut back on almost all goods including fuel and medicine, pushing up prices as basic services such as healthcare crumble.
The cabinet’s main focus was on a revival of talks with the International Monetary Fund, needed to unlock foreign aid. But an agreement on vital financial figures, a requirement to start negotiations, has not been reached.

7,Jack Dorsey steps down as Twitter CEO,"WASHINGTON: Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey resigned on Monday as the social media network’s CEO, after surviving ...","WASHINGTON: Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey resigned on Monday as the social media network’s CEO, after surviving an activist investor’s bid to oust him in 2020 and steering the firm during the tumult of Donald Trump’s presidency.
Dorsey — who also is chief executive of payments company Square — confronted during his tenure thorny freedom of speech issues, ways to make the platform profitable and pressure he had spread himself too thin.
With his recognisable look — shaved head and long beard, and his atypical style — Dorsey for years has embodied Twitter alone.
“There’s a lot of talk about the importance of a company being ‘founder led.’ Ultimately I believe that’s severely limiting and a single point of failure,” he wrote in an email to Twitter staff.
“I want you all to know that this was my decision and I own it. It was a tough one for me, of course,” he added.
The company said Twitter’s chief technical officer Parag Agrawal will replace Dorsey in the top post, with Dorsey remaining a member of the board until his term expires at the 2022 meeting of stockholders.
Like many Silicon Valley celebrities, from Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs to Bill Gates or Michael Dell, Dorsey dropped out of college, never graduating from either of the universities he attended, one in his native Missouri and the other in New York.
Dorsey is credited with coming up with the idea for Twitter when eventual co-founder Evan Williams gave workers at blogging startup Odeo two weeks to work on fun new projects as a way to break up the daily routine.
He ran Twitter from 2007-2008 and returned later as CEO after Dick Costolo resigned in June 2015.

8,King says Morocco to push for Israeli-Palestinian talks,Calls for trust-building efforts and urges both sides “to refrain from actions that obstruct the peace process”.,"RABAT: Morocco will push for a resumption of Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, King Mohammed VI said on Monday, almost a year after his country renewed ties with the Jewish state.
“Morocco will continue its efforts, building on its position and its excellent relations with all sides and relevant international actors, to provide the appropriate conditions for a return to the negotiating table,” the monarch said in a televised address.
Morocco renewed official relations with Israel in December last year, two decades after it cut ties with the outbreak of the second Palestinian intifada or uprising.
The rapprochement came amid a string of normalisation deals between Israel and Arab countries, brokered by the Trump administration.
In a speech, delivered on the UN-organised International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, King Mohammed stressed Morocco’s  “total solidarity with the Palestinian people” and its right to an independent state alongside Israel.
He called for trust-building efforts and urged both sides  “to refrain from actions that obstruct the peace process”.
The king, who heads the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation’s Al Quds committee charged with protecting Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem, warned against any attempt to change the city’s  “juridicial, historic and demographic” status.
His speech came days after an unprecedented visit by Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz, who signed a wide-ranging security pact with the kingdom.
Leftwing and Islamist organisations in Morocco have called for protests on Monday to voice their solidarity with the Palestinians.

9,UK will work ‘flat out’ to stop Iran from becoming N-power,"“We are absolutely determined to prevent Iran from securing a nuclear weapon,” says British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss.","LONDON: Britain will work  “flat out” and keep  “all options on the table” in order to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb, Foreign Secretary  Liz Truss vowed on Monday.
Truss met her Israeli counterpart Yair Lapid for talks in London on Monday, where he will also meet with Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Truss made the comments in a press briefing shortly after signing a  “memorandum of understanding” aimed at creating stronger collaboration between the two nations on cyber-security, defence and trade.
She said Britain would  “work flat out to prevent the Iranian regime from gaining nuclear weapons. “We are absolutely determined to prevent Iran from securing a nuclear weapon,” she added.
Iran said it hoped to reach an agreement with major powers on salvaging its 2015 nuclear deal at talks resuming in Vienna on Monday.
Truss said that Britain  “wants those talks to work, but if they don’t work, all options are on the table”. But Lapid accused Tehran of trying to get sanctions lifted.
“They will play for time, earn billions from the removal of sanctions, continue to deceive the world, and covertly advance their nuclear programme,” he said.
“This is what they have done in the past and it is what they will do this time as well. “The world must prevent this, and it can prevent this,” he added, calling for  “tighter sanctions (and) tighter supervision”.
