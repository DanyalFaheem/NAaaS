0,FPCCI opposes prolonged closure of Khunjerab border,Says the business community in Gilgit-Baltistan is financially suffering due to the closure of the Khunjerab pass.,"GILGIT: The Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industries (FPCCI) has demanded of Prime Minister Imran Khan to address grievances of the GB business community in wake of the prolonged closure of Khunjerab border.
According to a letter sent by the FPCCI’s capital office in-charge Qurban Ali to the premier on Monday, Khunjerab border had been closed for last two years, causing immense financial hardships to the business community.
It said the region’s business community was dependent on trade with China as there was no other industry in there. The business community, transporters, hotel owners and labourers in GB were financially suffering due to closure of the Khunjerab pass.
It pointed out that the trade volume through Khunjerab border had decrea­sed, which needed to be addressed at an appropriate forum.
The FPCCI letter said under the border agreement reached between Pakistan and China in 1986, the border remained closed for five winter months despite the fact that the road remained pliable around the year. Therefore, it requested the prime minister to revise the agreement so that border was kept open round the year.
The letter highlighted that GB tourism industry was yet to benefit from Chinese tourists as they were not allowed to visit GB through the Khunjerab pass.
It requested the prime minister to take up the issue with the Chinese president. It explained that the volume of exports from Pakistan to China was minimal or non-existent because the Chinese side had very strict quarantine protocols and certification requirements which Pakistan products seldom fulfilled.
The letter pointed out that GB businessmen were not part of official delegations visiting foreign countries, and called for making GB Chamber of Commerce and Industry part of official delegations on foreign visits.

He also changed the portfolio of one of his special assistants.
According to a notification issued here, the chief minister, exercising powers conferred upon him by Sub-Rule 4 of Rule 3 of the KP Government Rules of Business, 1985, assigned the portfolio of higher education, archives and libraries to minister Kamran Khan Bangash.
Also, Mr Arshad Ayub Khan was notified as the irrigation minister. Mr Bangash and Mr Ayub were made ministers at the start of the current month. However, their portfolios were not announced.

CM also appoints ex-senator Barrister Saif, ex-bureaucrat Sahibzada Saeed his aides

Mr Arshad is the brother of MPA Akbar Ayub Khan, who was de-notified as the local government and rural development minister in August this year.
In the letter of resignation, Mr Akbar had cited his ‘recently diagnosed illness’ as the reason for de-notification and said he wanted to focus on his health and constituency affair.
The chief minister also assigned minister Faisal Amin Khan Gandapur the local government and rural development portfolio.
Mr Amin, a brother of federal minister for Kashmir affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Ali Amin Khan Gandapur, had taken oath as a minister in April this year. However, he was not given any portfolio.
“I will do my best to deliver as there’s lots of potential for urban and rural services, services, planning and green initiatives,” Mr Amin wrote on his Twitter handle.
Mr Bangash also issued a statement about cabinet reshuffle and said a committed and alert team could ensure the achievement of the PTI agenda.
He said he tried to do his best as the provincial government’s spokesperson.
Mr Bangash also thanked Chief Minister Mahmood Khan for ‘reposing trust’ in him.
Meanwhile, the chief minister assigned the portfolio of social welfare, special education and women’s development to Zakat and Ushr minister Anwar Zeb Khan.
Also, he changed the portfolio of special assistant to the chief minister on energy and power department Taj Mohammad Khan Tarand and gave him the charge of the revenue and estate department.
In a separate notification, the chief minister announced the appointment of former Muttahida Qaumi Movement Senator Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif and former bureaucrat Sahibzada Saeed as his special assistants.
Barrister Saif was given the portfolio of the information and public relations department and Mr Saeed that of the energy and power department.
Mr Saif, who had joined the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf in March this year, will act as the spokesman for the provincial government.
The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa cabinet has now 15 ministers, and four advisers and five special assistants to the chief minister. Also, four lawmakers have been made parliamentary secretaries for various departments, according to the information posted on the official website of the provincial assembly.
Under Article 130(6) of the Constitution, the strength of the cabinet shall not exceed 15 or 11 per cent of the total membership of a provincial assembly, whichever is higher.
In May this year, the provincial government had acknowledged in the assembly that it had overstepped its authority by inducting more ministers in the cabinet than allowed by the Constitution.
The number of cabinet members reached 17 after the induction of four ministers in April. However, the chief minister removed revenue minister Qalandar Khan Lodhi to reduce the cabinet size.

Some of the emotionally charged protesters lied down on the road in front of the loaded vehicles, thus suspending traffic for some time. They were, however, later removed by the security personnel to restore traffic.
Fahmeedullah Shinwari, a spokesman for the protesting labourers, said on the occasion that the government wanted the poor porters and daily wagers to acquire visas for entering Afghanistan.
“We will never submit to visa condition nor will we apply for a visa as it will deprive us of our legitimate and internationally recognised status to maneuver between the two neighbouring countries under the easement rights accorded to us both by Pakistan and Afghanistan,” Mr Shinwari told Dawn on contact.
He demanded of the immigration and security officials to allow their cross-border movement either on their Nadra-verified CNICs or a token issued to them by any competent authority.

6,PPP defiant as Peshawar administration denies public meeting permission,"“If the PTI can hold the public meeting, then what is wrong with our party?” asks PPP's Nayyar Hussain Bukhari.","PESHAWAR: The opposition Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) is set to stage a power show in Peshawar on its foundation day today (Tuesday) despite the deputy commissioner’s refusal to allow it to hold a public meeting.
Accompanied by Sindh information minister Saeed Ghani during a news conference here on Monday, PPP secretary general Nayyar Hussain Bukhari blasted the DC for not giving permission to the party to mark its 54th foundation day.
Party chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and senior leaders will attend the event.
“This is our fundamental right to mark the party’s foundation day,” Mr Bukhari said, adding that the DC had permitted the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf to hold a public meeting in the same area a few days ago.

DC cites LG polls, security situation as reasons for decision

“If the PTI can hold the public meeting, then what is wrong with the PPP?”
The PPP leader said the Peshawar DC was the state’s servant and not a particular party’s.
He said the local party leadership had sought permission for the foundation day public meeting but the DC denied it.
“The party regularly organises the foundation day function in every unit of the federation,” he said.
The DC, according to the official letter, declined to entertain the request of the PPP to hold the public meeting for two reasons.
“In light of the ongoing local government elections 2021 and as per the code of conduct issued by the Election Commission of Pakistan for political parties, contesting candidates, election agents through a letter, your (PPP provincial information secretary) application cannot be entertained. Secondly, keeping in view the security situation, your application is regretted,” he said. Despite the permission denial, the party kept setting up the public meeting stage at Patang Chowk on the Ring Road. Also, its leadership cut the cake there in the evening.
On the occasion, Mr Ghani lashed out at the federal government for its ‘antagonistic attitude’ towards the Sindh government.
He termed Prime Minister Imran Khan “the most ill-informed” head of the government and said the federal government should not blame the Sindh government for the shortage of wheat, sugar, gas, and other essential commodities.
The Sindh minister said the shortage of fertiliser on the market was brewing and the farmers had to pay more, but the federal government would again blame the Sindh government for crises.
He claimed that the PPP was gaining popularity in Karachi and its vote bank was increasing.
Regarding unauthorised construction in Karachi, Mr Ghani said a commission had been constituted to regularise 6,000 illegal housing societies in Punjab and the same decision should be applied to Sindh.
He said the issue of unauthorised construction existed across the country, including Islamabad.
“The Supreme Court had imposed Rs1.8 million fine for unauthorised construction of a huge building on the Constitution Avenue in Islamabad but regularised the structure. The same criteria should be applied to Sindh as well,” he said.
Meanwhile, PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said after a long struggle and unprecedented sacrifices, only his party could ‘pave the way’ for democracy in Pakistan.
In a statement issued by the party’s Media Cell here ahead of the foundation day, the PPP chairman said only his party’s manifesto and strategy could make the court a truly democratic and welfare state.
“The PPP is a revolutionary movement based on the ideology of Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the philosophy of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, and the struggles and sacrifices of many generations. Even in face of the most difficult circumstances, the PPP gave the country and the nation a rich strategic gift, including the country’s first unified Constitution, nuclear programme guaranteeing invincible defence and missile technology, provincial sovereignty, and agrarian and economic reforms,” he said.
Mr Bilawal said the PPP had also made Pakistan the hub of Islamic world and strengthened the Pakistan-China friendship.
“Today, I salute all jiyalas [workers], who sacrificed their lives for the cause of democracy, endured the hardships of imprisonment, deportation, and undemocratic forces, and also faced sponsored media trials,” he said.

7,Peshawar records lowest coverage during anti-measles campaign,Eight schools were also sealed for not allowing the vaccination of students.,"PESHAWAR: Eight private schools were sealed in Peshawar on Monday for not allowing health workers to vaccinate students during the recent province-wide campaign against measles/rubella.
The district administration has launched drive to cover the refusal cases in Peshawar, which has 63 per cent vaccination coverage, the lowest in the province recorded during the campaign, according to officials.
The district administration in collaboration with health department has launched a catch-up campaign to reach the people, who have not been immunised during the drive, carried out from November 15 to 17. A total of 1.6 million people were administered the shots in the province, according to a report of health department.
A press release said that district administration sealed eight schools in different parts of the provincial capital for refusing vaccination during the catch-up drive after the province-wide campaign under which 16,166,837 people were immunised.

Eight schools sealed for not allowing vaccination of students

Officials said that the schools were identified by expanded programme on immunisation (EPI) of health department in a report. Despite isolated incidents of hesitancy shown by parents against the vaccination, more coverage was recorded than the 15.6 million target children set forth at the start of the drive, they added.
Deputy Commissioner Khalid Mehmood deputed assistant commissioners to check schools not covered in the campaign. On the occasion, administration convinced the defiant people, who allowed inoculation of their children during the catch-up campaign.
The press release said that besides covering the missed people between nine months to 15 years, the officials backed by social mobilisers explained the benefits associated with the vaccine to people and told them that the reluctant ones would face due course of law.
The health officials said that prior to launch of the drive, the government ordered the schools to cooperate with health workers and ensure vaccination of all students. Those showing defiance would face three-month imprisonment along with Rs10, 000 fine.
The administration has invoked the Epidemic Control and Emergency Relief Act, 2020, which stipulates imposition of a Rs1 million fine on the schools for refusing vaccination.
Meanwhile, a report by the health department said that 100 per cent target was achieved with the support of the administration in every district and vaccinators were still in the field to go after the people, who hadn’t been administered shots either due to refusal or their non-availability when the vaccinators visited their houses.
It said that government schools were extremely cooperative but health workers faced challenges in private schools where children stayed unvaccinated. The heads of the schools argued that parents of the children were not willing to get them immunised.
The vaccination report said that except Peshawar with 63 per cent coverage, all the districts recorded from 100 to 130 per cent coverage, making the average 100 per cent during the campaign. Khyber recoded 95pc coverage, Swabi and Kolai Palas 96 per cent each while 99pc coverage was recorded by Chitral Upper, Chitral Lower and Kohistan Upper during the drive.
The vaccinators administered vaccine to 130 per cent people in the target age group in Dir Upper, 119pc in Swat, 117pc in Nowshera, 116pc in Tank, 114 pc in Kurram and 113 pc in Bajaur.
The report said that 15,000 vaccinators covered 1,136,847 people in outreach activities, 902 and 696 in communities, 282,624 in schools, 43,772 through mobile vans, and 4701 at fixed centres located in public sector hospitals across the province.
Officials said the campaign was launched in response to the cases of both measles and rubella in the province. Both the ailments were vaccine-preventable while unimmunised people were vulnerable to blindness, pneumonia, diarrhoea and abortions, they added.

Lower Chitral deputy commissioner Hassan Abid said the NHA had approached the Upper Dir administration, asking it to impose limit on loads of goods transport on the Lowari Road.

Mr Abid said during random checking of the loaded trucks near the tunnel the NHA found the trucks having loads of 65 to 70 tons, which exceeded the 28-ton capacity allowed inside the tunnel.
He said the overloaded trucks had also posed grave threat to the makeshift steel bridge in Broze Gol area.
The deputy commissioner said every road and suspension bridge over rivers and streams had a design capacity which should not be exceeded at any cost.
