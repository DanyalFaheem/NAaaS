0,Scrutiny committee submits report in PTI foreign funding case,The case involving the ruling party has been awaiting ECP decision for seven years.,"ISLAMABAD: A scrutiny committee of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) constituted in March 2019 to audit the foreign funds of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has finally submitted its report to the commission — around six months after the last deadline it was given. 
Sources told Dawn that since two sitting members of the ECP were out of town, the commission would examine the report upon their return before taking up the case for an open hearing. The ECP member from Sindh, Shah Muhammad Jatoi, is scheduled to return on Tuesday (today) and the member from Balochistan on Wednesday. 
The foreign funding case against the PTI continues to linger since November 2014 when it was filed by the party’s founding member, Akbar S. Babar. 
In his petition, Babar had alleged serious financial irregularities in the ruling party’s accounts, including illegal sources of funding, concealment of bank accounts within the country and abroad, money laundering and use of private bank accounts of party employees as a front to receive illegal donations from the Middle East. 

The case involving PTI awaiting ECP decision for seven years 

The ECP had in September last year trashed an “incomplete” report of its scrutiny committee on the foreign funding case. In an order, the commission said the report was neither complete nor well detailed. 
“The Scrutiny Committee on the basis of documents provided by both the parties and collected from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has neither scrutinised the rec­ord nor evaluated the evidence from the documents and failed to form definite opinion,” the ECP noted. 
While reprimanding the panel, it observed that it was the duty and responsibility of the committee to scrutinise the authenticity, reliability and credibility of each and every document(s) submitted to it by both the parties. It said the committee had the authority to approach proper forums, sources and people to confirm the authenticity or otherwise of the documents. 
“Admittedly, law provides criteria of authenticity and credibility for scrutiny of the documents, but the committee has not adopted proper procedure in this respect,” the ECP observed. 
In its damning order on the scrutiny committee’s report, the commission noted that no definite conclusion had been drawn. “It is painful to say that... directions were not followed in strict sense... in spite of lapse of more than 28/29 months,” it stated. It ordered the committee to conduct the scrutiny afresh and complete it as soon as possible, but not later than six weeks. 
Under the last order, the scrutiny committee was supposed to submit its report by the end of May, which it submitted now on Friday. 
The ECP had allowed perusal of the financial records by two financial auditors of the petitioners during the fresh scrutiny process, during which some startling revelations were made: one of which was about authorising four paid PTI employees to receive donations from abroad in their personal bank accounts. 
The petitioner, after conclusion of the scrutiny, had also released a fact-finding report revealing illegal funding worth Rs2.2 billion. The report also detailed the concealment of PTI bank accounts from the ECP. It stated that the ruling party had not declared all of its bank accounts and neither provided bank statements of all its accounts.

1,Controversial Indian farm reforms law repealed,Farm Laws Repeal bill passed houses of parliament with scant debate 10 days after Modi announced surprise decision to withdraw.,"NEW: Indian lawmakers on Monday repealed agricultural legislation that provoked a year of nationwide protests from farmers, in a move that was seen as a major reversal and rare climbdown for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government, which had ardently defended the controversial reforms. 
The Farm Laws Repeal bill passed the lower and upper houses of parliament with scant debate ten days after Modi announced the surprise decision to withdraw the three laws in a televised national address. 
Protesting farmers have hunkered down in makeshift camps outside the capital of New Delhi since November of last year to demand the removal of the laws, which they fear would drastically shrink their incomes. 
The repeal bill will need to be signed by the president before it is formally implemented. But farmers last week said their demonstrations will continue. Thousands of jubilant farmers on tractors, jeeps and cars, waved green and white flags as they rode along highways ringing New Delhi to celebrate their victory, but made it clear that the government has not met all of their demands. 
Rakesh Tikait, a top farmer leader, said that they needed government assurances of guaranteed prices for certain essential crops, like wheat and rice — a system introduced in the 1960s to help India shore up its food reserves and prevent shortages. He demanded that the government set up a committee to settle these demands before the famers consider ending their protests. 
Farmers form one of India’s most influential voting blocs. Modi’s decision to scrap the new laws came ahead of elections early next year in key states like Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, both significant agricultural producers and where his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is eager to shore up its support. 
Modi’s far-right Hindu nationalist party already holds power in Uttar Pradesh, but its support is under pressure over a struggling economy and the government’s response to the pandemic. If farmers desert the ruling party, it will not only shrink prospects to form a state government for a second term but also weaken chances for the party to get an overwhelming majority in the 2024 national elections. 
Political analysts say these upcoming elections are a major reason behind the surprise move to withdraw the unpopular agricultural reforms, but that it’s too early to say whether it will work. 
The government initially insisted that the new legislation, which would open the way to a deregulated market and more private-sector control in agriculture, was urgently needed to modernise Indian farming. 
But farmers feared that the government’s move to introduce market reforms would leave workers poorer.

2,Larger Supreme Court bench to hear pleas against govt workers’ sacking,Appointment of amicus curiae likely.,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Monday decided to constitute a larger bench — bigger than the current three-judge bench — to hear a set of petitions seeking review of its Aug 17 judgement, which had rendered almost 17,000 government employees jobless. 
“In view of the questions raised in the matter, it would be appropriate that a larger bench is constituted to hear the review petitions,” observed Justice Umar Ata Bandial, while dictating the order after a brief hearing on the review petitions. The court will take up the matter again on Wednesday. 
The court also dropped hints to appoint an amicus curiae (friend of the court) to assist it in the matter since apparently no one appears to represent the other side or support the judgement of the Supreme Court. 
Moreover, the restraining order issued on Nov 11 prohibiting the government from evicting the employees from official residences they were living in till the pendency of the review petition will continue to remain in force. 

Appointment of amicus curiae likely 

Senior counsel Raza Rabbani, representing officers of the Intelligence Bureau (IB), suggested that the last interim order continue until the matter was decided. 
The court is seized with a number of review petitions, mainly from the federal government, seeking review of the Aug 17 judgement of the Supreme Court. 
On the eve of his retirement, Justice Mushir Alam had on Aug 17 declared as illegal and unconstitutional a PPP-era law called the Sacked Employees (Reinstatement) Ordinance Act, 2010, (SERA) under which a number of people were employed or promoted in 1989-90. 
The court, however, asked the counsel representing a number of petitioners to furnish concise statements also clarifying that the review proceedings had a limited scope and did not mean rehearing of the entire controversy. 
During the hearing, Justice Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed, while pointing towards Additional Attorney General (AAG) Sajid Ilyas Bhatti, reminded that the federal government had earlier opposed the legislation called SERA. 
The court also asked the AAG to classify all categories of employees highlighting which departments they belonged to and whether they were employees of autonomous bodies, semi-autonomous or civil servants. 
As usual a large number of affected employees were present outside the Supreme Court when it took up the matter for hearing. 
The federal government, being represented through Attorney General Khalid Jawed Khan, had stated before the Supreme Court that though it had declared SERA illegal despite the fact that the act had been passed by the parliament, no notice had been issued to a large number of employees who were direct beneficiaries of the act, but lost or would lose their jobs immediately without any opportunity of being heard by the top court. 
The petition recalled that though a notice to the AGP had been given by the court in 2010, no formal notice had been issued and served to the AGP in terms of the required mandatory rules. 
At the last hearing on Nov 11, the SC had issued notice to the AGP under Order 27A Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) in addition to notices given to 16,000 employees without being heard by the court Though the government fully supports the principle of transparency, merit and due process in the public employment, the petition contended, the erstwhile sacked employees falling and benefiting under the SERA may not be rendered completely jobless merely owing to deficiencies and, therefore, their rights and interests should be protected in a manner that did not harm other employees. 
The petition highlighted the need for adopting a more equitable approach to balance the rights and interests of all parties on a more transparent and merit-based criteria.  
Accordingly, material provisions of SERA redressing injustices meted out to an overwhelming number of erstwhile sacked employees resulting from their earlier arbitrary terminations could have been avoided rather than outright annulment of the entire SERA, the petition pleaded. 
The petition explained that the act was neither meant for nor applied to those civil servants whose service was governed under the provisions of the Civil Servants Act, 1973, and the rules framed thereunder.

3,Senate body concerned over slow progress on CPEC in Gwadar,"Committee has a rare, guided visit to Gwadar for on-site meeting.","GWADAR: Amid ongoing protests in Gwadar over lack of civic facilities, the Senate Standing Committee on Planning and Development has expressed concern over the sluggish progress on projects related to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) in the port city. 
The  committee led by PPP Senator Salim Mandviwalla had a rare, guided visit  to Gwadar for an on-site meeting on CPEC-related projects and observed  that progress on infrastructure and basic facilities had not met  expectations so far and was not enough to lure local and international  investors. 
This was reinforced by General Officer Commander (GOC)  Special Security Division South Major General Inayat Hussain, who  testified before the meeting that next summer would be real hell in  Gwadar if immediate steps were not taken to address basic issues  confronting the people of Gwadar. 
“Even this investment will roll  back, please cut through the red tape and ensure gas and electricity.  Next summer will be a real hell and create problems,” Mr Inayat warned  and informed the senate committee that the people of Gwadar were holding  a continuous sit-in. “We need electricity before next summer,” he said. 
Senator  Mandviwalla said that water, gas and electricity were big challenges  for the city and, as warned by GOC Inayat, unless these issues were  addressed the difficulties of the people of Gwadar would not subside and  their living standards would not improve.  
He asked the  government to seriously focus on providing basic facilities and hoped  that the commitment shown by the federal and provincial governments as  well as by the CPEC authority would resolve the problems, address red  tape and improve water distribution system to resolve such issues at the  earliest. 
Senator Palwasha Khan said the progress on paper  stood in total contrast to the ground reality. She said on paper large  financial allocations had been made but these were not noticeable on  ground except a few buildings and the local people were living in  sub-human lives at a time they learn day in and out that large amounts  were being spent in their name. 
Senator Shafique Tareen said the  only thing to notice around was the new building of a technical and  vocational institute which neither had any syllabus, nor training  modules or the teachers. The explanation is that factories would be set  up first and syllabus would be designed as per requirement of those  factories. 
During the meeting, Iqbal Z. Ahmad,  chairman of Associated Group that controls Pakistan Gasport LNG Terminal  and Jamshoro Joint Venture Limited, complained that the Gwadar  Port Authority was not issuing no-objection certification for a  virtual pipeline and barge-mounted floating storage unit at Gwadar  that could address gas and electricity shortage of Gwadar residents and  investors within seven months. 
He said his company was capable of  delivering gas and electricity in the port city within seven months if  facilitated by the government and reported that he was ready to provide  300 million cubic feet per day of LNG in cylinders to the people at half  the cost of LPG. 
The project will  have annual turnover of $1bn and generate economic activity of over  $10bn. GPA Chairman Naseer Kashani challenged some of the facts, saying  the GPA originally had an agreement with Daewoo Corporation of Korea  which planned a virtual pipeline and also had a licence from Oil and Gas  Regulatory Authority.

4,9/11 survivors want Afghanistan’s $7bn funds in US paid as compensation,About 150 family members of Sept 11 victims went to the courts nearly 20 years ago to seek compensation for their losses.,"WASHINGTON: Families of the 9/11 victims want the entire $7 billion of Afghan assets — withheld at the US Federal Reserve — paid as compensation for the terrorist attacks that killed and injured thousands, the US media reported on Monday. 
The New York Times reported that the Biden administration “is scheduled to tell a federal court on Friday what outcome would be in the US national interest,” — returning the money to Kabul or distributing it among the survivors and families of the 9/11 victims. 
“The US Justice Department has been negotiating with lawyers for the 9/11 plaintiffs a potential deal to divide up the money, if the government supports their attempt to seize it,” the report added. 
“The White House National Security Council has been working with agencies across the government to weigh the proposal.” 
About 150 family members of Sept 11 victims went to the courts nearly 20 years ago to seek compensation for their losses. Almost 3,000 people were killed, and more than 5,000 were injured. The lawsuit named targets, like Al Qaeda and Taliban, who, they said, orchestrated the attack and therefore must pay the compensation as well. 
A decade later, a court found the defendants liable by default and ordered them to pay damages now worth about $7 billion. 
The judgment, however, seemed symbolic as the US invaded Afghanistan soon after the attacks, deposed the Taliban regime and decimated Al Qaeda. 
On Aug 15 this year, the Taliban returned to power and claimed that about $7 billion of the Afghan central bank, frozen at the US Federal Reserve in New York, was rightfully theirs.

5,Magdalena Andersson elected Sweden’s PM for second time,"101 members vote for her, while 75 abstain and another 173 vote against her.","STOCKHOLM: Sweden’s parliament on Monday elected Magdalena Andersson as the country’s prime minister — the first woman to hold the post — five days after her initial bid lasted only hours. 
Despite being a nation that has long championed gender equality, Sweden has never before had a woman as prime minister. 
Last week Andersson was elected by parliament but she had to resign just hours later — before she even had a chance to formally take office — after her budget failed to pass through parliament and the Green Party quit her coalition government. 
The parliamentary turbulence was unprecedented in politically stable Sweden, where the Social Democrats have dominated for almost a century. 
With 10 months to go before September general elections, the 54-year-old, who is the outgoing finance minister, will now head a minority government made up solely of the Social Democrats. 

101 members vote for her, while 75 abstain and another 173 vote against her

She is due to formally take over the post on Tuesday (today), succeeding outgoing Prime Minister Stefan Lofven after his seven years in power. 
A total of 101 members of parliament voted for her, while 75 abstained and 173 voted against. 
Under Sweden’s system, a prime ministerial candidate does not need the support of a majority in parliament, they just need to avoid a majority of 175 voting against them. 
“It was a big day last Wednesday, and it was a big day today,” Andersson told reporters after the vote, adding that this time around, “I was perhaps more prepared for it to be emotional”. 
Andersson now faces a challenging period in the run-up to the election, which observers predict will be a close race. 
The Social Democrats are currently hovering close to their lowest-ever approval ratings, at around 25 per cent. 
Meanwhile, the right-wing opposition, led by the conservative Moderates, has in recent years inched closer to the once-ostracised anti-immigration Sweden Democrats and hopes to govern with its informal backing. 
Weak minority 
While some experts say the Social Democrats will now have an easier time as the sole party in power without having to make concessions to a coalition partner, others predict a bumpy road ahead. 
Her weak minority — the Social Democrats hold 100 of 349 seats in parliament — means she will have to seek support for her policies on both the left and the right. 
The Social Democrats “have a long tradition of cooperation and we’re ready to do what it takes to take Sweden forward,” she said after her election. 
She will also have to govern with a budget presented by the opposition conservative Moderates, Christian Democrats and far-right Sweden Democrats, after her budget failed to get adopted. 
Her most natural cooperation partners are the Greens, the Centre and Left parties. 
But she is also expected to court the right on issues blocked by the Greens during their time in government, including the expansion of Stockholm’s Arlanda airport and a nuclear fuel waste site. 
Andersson has also singled out crime and immigration — key voter concerns — among her top priorities, issues where the Social Democrats are closer ideologically to the centre-right. 
The opposition has however been quick to point out that the right-wing is more united than the left, and would likely be able to pass many of its policies without the Social Democrats. 
The four opposition parties on the centre and right control 174 seats in parliament, while the four parties on the left and centre, which hold 175 seats, are more splintered. 
“The Social Democrats will have to accept that it is parliament that decides and government obeys,” Moderates leader Ulf Kristersson warned before the vote. 
An economist who has served as finance minister for the past seven years, Andersson took over as leader of the Social Democrats on Nov 4 from Lofven. 
He resigned as prime minister a week later in order to give her time to prepare for the September elections.
