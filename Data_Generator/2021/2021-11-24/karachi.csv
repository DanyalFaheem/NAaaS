0,Around 500 acres submerged after dyke breach in Khairpur,"Flooding also hit a hospital, a primary school and some villages besides inundating a big part of the highway near Kot Diji town.","DADU: Around 500 acres of farmland submerged in flooding caused by a breach in the dyke of Mohabbat Wah (irrigation channel) near Kot Diji town of Khairpur district on Tuesday. 
Flooding also hit a hospital, a primary school and some villages besides inundating a big part of the highway near the town. Flow of vehicular traffic on the highway was badly affected.
Growers of the area told local reporters that they suffered heavy losses due to the incident and slow pace of breach plugging work. The deluge swept away the wheat and vegetable crops, they said.  
Sukkur Barrage chief engineer Syed Sardar Ahmed Shah told this reporter at about 9pm that the plugging work had been completed. He said local irrigation officials along with machinery, stone pitching material and labourers had rushed to the spot after receiving information about the breach. He said he had ordered an inquiry into the incident in order to fix responsibility. He believed that the dyke could not withstand pressure of heavy flows as growers would stop drawing water in night hours.
The plugging work was supervised by the superintendent engineer and executive engineer concerned.

1,SIUT being pressed to accept Hyderabad college building for dialysis centre,"HYDERABAD: Establishment of a medical college would keep eluding students of Hyderabad and its adjoining districts,...","HYDERABAD: Establishment of a medical college would keep eluding students of Hyderabad and its adjoining districts, who are aspiring for professional education within their own district, as Sindh government has decided to hand over a medical college building in the city to the Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation (SIUT) on an ‘as is where is’ basis despite the latter’s unwillingness.
The college project costing over Rs1.394bn was approved in the financial year 2012-13 and 90pc physical progress had been made. The completion was delayed due to belated releases of funds. An expenditure of Rs974.297m had already been incurred on the building that has remained unused so far.
“We can at the most manage dialysis services in Hyderabad. Even otherwise we are a postgraduate, not undergraduate, institution,” said an SIUT official. “We are not willing to accept the building but Sindh government wants us to do this. It’s very, very difficult on our part,” he remarked while requesting anonymity. 
“SIUT is also aware of the fact that this is a college building meant for medical education of students of Hyderabad and its adjoining districts. But Sindh government is pressing us to take it over,” said the official. He said the SIUT could best run a dialysis centre.
Sindh government, in fact, provides funds to SIUT for urology and transplantation services. The institute wants to establish only a dialysis centre for Hyderabad to lessen burden of patients from lower Sindh region who have to approach the SIUT Karachi. Its team has paid multiple visits to Hyderabad and inspected a number of buildings for starting dialysis facilities in the city. But it has not taken a final decision as yet.
Sindh government, in the meantime, has come up with the decision of handing over the medical college building to the SIUT. The process was started in August and the Sindh chief minister approved the summary in October. 
The government got a summary moved through health secretary Kazim Jatoi in August, mentioning that “90pc physical progress has been reported by project director”. Mr Jatoi stated that the execution of medical college scheme could not be done due to Covid-19 situation in 2019-20. He further stated that a sum of Rs10.944m were allocated for FY2020-21 as against throw forward of Rs416.077m.
Mr Jatoi proposed that “CM Sindh may like to accord permission for handing over of building of Hyderabad Medical College to SIUT on ‘as is where is‘ basis so that SIUT can complete the scheme as per their requirements and standards after finalization of other operational modalities including memorandum of understanding (MoU)”.
Outgoing chairman of the Planning and Development Board Mohammad Waseem had mentioned in the summary that “with proposed handing over on ‘as is and where is basis’, health department may also need to explore commitment of SIUT to bear cost of remaining works assessed by SIUT as being essential. Alternatively, infrastructure, on which as mentioned above 90pc progress had been accomplished and for which balance of approved civil works cost has been provided in ADP 2020-21, may be expeditiously completed by health department in accordance with provisions of approved PC-I and in consultation with SIUT”.
The finance secretary then recommended that “for transfer of Medical College Hyderabad on ‘as is and where is basis’, health department and SIUT may finalize an agreement where all the key roles and responsibilities of parties are formalized”.
The scheme’s papers show that it was approved when PPP had formed its coalition government with MQM in 2008. The latter quit the government in 2012 due to differences over dual local government law. The funds were released for the scheme but later Sindh government apparently had a second thought and came up with this proposal of handing over the college to the SIUT.
People of Hyderabad had been aspiring for a general university as well as medical, engineering and other professional colleges for as long as one could remember. 
Sindh government had only upgraded the Govt College Kali Mori in Oct 2017 as a general university. The federal government got a bill passed on Nov 17 during a joint session of the parliament for the establishment of the ‘Hyderabad Institute for Technology and Management Sciences’ which was tabled by Sabir Kaimkhani, an MNA from Hyderabad.

He also spoke to the media along with his brother and JUI-F Larkana district emir Maulana Nasir Mehmood Soomro, Muhabbat Khuhro and other party leaders.
The conference would also guarantee democracy, peace, prosperity and economic stability in the country, said Rashid Soomro. 
He said that judges and courts ought to fairly settle the matter of alleged audio tape of former SC chief justice Saqib Nisar and the notarised statement of former Gilgit-Baltistan chief judge Rana Shamim. “Such things are a question mark on the independence of judiciary and rule of law,” he said. 
The Maulana described the PTI government as ‘illegitimate’ and claimed that it had damaged the country’s image abroad. He observed that surfacing of certain videotapes was also shaking people’s confidence in  institutions. He apprehended that the masses might lose their confidence in them if suspicions were not removed. 
He criticised Prime Minister Imran Khan for first making tall claims and then pushing the country into multiple crises by pursuing “flawed” policies, and pointed out that the country was now faced with worst-ever economic crisis.
“Oppression is all around and no one is there to ask people about their plight. They are deprived of their fundamental and constitutional rights,” he claimed.
Regarding JUI-F’s Nov 27 conference, being held in the Municipal Stadium in Larkana, Maulana Soomro said that Maulana Fazlur Rehman and leaders of various religious parties and nationalist groups would participate and speak conference. “It would be the biggest-ever and historical conference in Sindh,” he said. 
“The congregation will unanimously say ‘No’ to the selected, inept and inefficient rulers at the Centre and the thieves ruling over Sindh,” said Maulana Rashid Soomro. 
“We have to send Imran Khan government packing to save the country ... JUI-F has emerged as an alternative force in Sindh and will offer strong resistance to the ruling party in the upcoming elections,” he said.

6,CM Murad approaches PM Imran for retaining transferred officials,"Demands more PAS, PSP officers to fill shortage in Sindh.","KARACHI: Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Tuesday requested Prime Minister Imran Khan to direct the Establishment Division to fill the shortage of federal officers from BS-17 to BS-21 and depute requisite number of officers to the province.
In a letter to the PM, he also said that the provincial government considered the Nov 9 notifications of officers’ transfer and postings in the province as ‘proposals’ from the prime minister and did not agree to them to withdraw four BS-20 officers of the Pakistan Administrative Services (PAS) and seven BS-20 officers of Police Services of Pakistan (PSP).
The CM wrote to the PM that the provincial government had to respond within 30 days on the ‘proposals’ of transfers as per the Civil Service of Pakistan (Composition and Cadre) Rules, 1954.
He said that the provincial government did not agree to the proposal to withdraw four PAS officers — Hassan Naqvi, Zahid Ali Abbasi, Dr Kazim Hussain Jatoi and Khalid Hyder Shah — and seven BS-20 PSP officers — DIGs Abdullah Shaikh, Nouman Siddiqui, Saqib Ismail Memon, Javed Akbar Riaz, Naeem Shaikh, Maqsood Ahmed and Omar Shahid Hamid.

Demands more PAS, PSP officers to fill shortage in Sindh

However, the chief minister stated that the provincial government agreed to the proposal of sending four PAS officers — Atif Rehman, Khalid Saleem, Noreen Bashir and Ali Hussain Malik — and four PSP officers in BS-20 — DIGs Muhammad Karim Khan, Shahzad Akbar, Muhammad Zubair Dreshak and Syed Khuram Ali.
Giving the legal aspect of the issue, Mr Shah stated that it was evident that the rules necessitated “meaningful consultation” between the prime minister and the chief minister with regards to placement/withdrawal of federal officers from and to a province.
He said that for posting of a chief secretary, the prime minister had to send a name or a panel of names, and the chief minister had to respond to the proposal within 15 days. 
“It is also laid down in the Rules that if the chief minister does not respond in 15 days, it will be considered that the chief minister has approved the proposal,” Mr Shah said, adding that this explicitly meant that the chief minister could disapprove the proposal but within 15 days.
Furthermore, he said, it was obligatory for the chief minister to seek approval of the provincial cabinet before responding to the prime minister in case of withdrawal from or transfer to a province of officer other than the chief secretary.
He said that the federal government had not posted the requisite number of officer as per the rules in the last several years. He said that out of 67 seats, only 20 PAS officer were presently available to Sindh, while only 22 BS-20 PSP officers were posted in the province against a total strength of 26.
The CM recalled that the provincial government had approached the federal government several times and wrote to the establishment division to provide the requisite number of officers against the posts reserved for them.
He wrote: “On 25-10-2021, the issue was brought into the notice of Supreme Court, wherein Attorney General of Pakistan assured that sufficient number of officers would be posted in Sindh government on receipt of details of vacant posts from the Sindh government. The Supreme Court directed the Attorney General to ensure that the problem was resolved. Consequently, the Advocate General, Sindh vide his letter dated 27-10.2021 addressed to the Attorney General communicated the details of vacant posts in Sindh government with the request to provide PAS officers of BS-17 and BS-21 as per the share.”
The CM said that while the response to provincial government’s request was still awaited, the establishment division issued notifications on Nov 9 withdrawing four PAS and seven PSP officers of BS-20 from Sindh.
“It may also be mentioned here that recently five PSP officers of BPS-20 were withdrawn from the province. Thus, the proposal of withdrawing more PSP officers would mean that half of the officers in BPS-20 will be new to the province and would know nothing about the administrative challenges.
“Dear Prime Minister, kindly consider the above as the response of the government of Sindh to the proposal of the federal government and direct the establishment division to issue necessary notifications. The establishment division may also please be directed to fill the shortage in BS-17 to BS-21 by deputing requisite number of officers to the province of Sindh,” the chief minister concluded.

10,SHC asks magistrates to visit protected sites to ensure preservation,KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Tuesday directed district judges to depute magistrates of jurisdiction concerned to...,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Tuesday directed district judges to depute magistrates of jurisdiction concerned to visit sites/monuments protected under antiquities law across the province and empower them to call authorities for restoration and preservation of their dignity as well antiquity value of such properties.  
A single-judge bench of SHC headed by Justice Salahuddin Panhwar also ruled that such properties under the Ancient Monument Preservation Act 1904 and the Antiquities Act 1975 were not owned by any private person.  
The issue of ancient properties cannot be equated as private properties under the Heritage Act 1994, but that of antiquities therefore judicial propriety demands serious attention on above reflected properties, it added.  
It also directed the deputy commissioners to visit ancient properties in their respective areas on quarterly basis and ensure that the same remained along with antiquities department and no damage/loss was caused to such properties and also called detail report from secretary of culture, tourism, antiquities and archives department regarding creation of endowment fund and restoration of such properties in their original form.  
At the outset of the hearing, the secretary of culture submitted a list of 129 protected sites/monuments notified under the Antiquities Act 1975 across the province.  
The bench came down heavily on the secretary and other officials of the culture department for lack of preservation of such sites and said that the department was established with the sole purpose to ensuring protection of these properties with their antiquity and it would never be suffice to give such properties in a relevant list or notification but required much more to protect them.  
It directed the culture department to also submit a detailed report as to how and what steps were being taken to ensure preserving antiquity value of such sites and it must include earlier and present pictures of these properties.  
These directives were passed during the hearing of a suit as the plaintiff contended that they had been condemned unheard while declaring their property Saddar Mansion as heritage though direction were issued by the divisional bench that a departmental committee was required to provide opportunity of hearing.  
The bench asked the secretary to listen to plaintiff and pass appropriate order in accordance with law within three months.  
Tour guides appointments 
At this juncture, the secretary of culture department contended that they were going to recruit tour guides having requisite qualifications enabling the local as well as foreign tourists to provide them basic knowledge and cultural history and historical knowledge in scientific manner by the use of modern gadgets.  
The bench asked him to ensure such appointments, preferably within six months.  
It observed that the law itself put the culture department under heavy duty to protect such sites and it was required to own its responsibility on war-basis and ensure that there must not be any further loss/damage or defacing to such protected properties.  
The secretary conceded that there was no concept of endowment fund to preserve such properties and he agreed that they will place summary with regard to creation of endowment fund keeping a room for public at large to join as stakeholders to reserve/preserve ancient properties.  
“Needless to mention that Culture, Tourism, Antiquities and Archives Department, shall classify properties in two groups, one notified under the Heritage Act 1994 and another notified under the Ancient Monument Preservation Act 1904. Needless to mention that in judgment passed by divisional bench of this court properties notified under the Act of 1994 whereas Culture, Tourism, Antiquities and Archives Department, is not entitled to examine the architectural value of the properties/places as notified under the Act of 1904 therefore both lists shall be filed separately”, the order said.

It is thoughtful of the VM Art Gallery that it has come up with a group show titled Emerged, which has been basically arranged in honour of the gallery’s 17-year legacy of the Emerging Talent Exhibition.
It showcases works of some of its chosen alumni to celebrate their careers since their time as Emerging Talent participants. They are: Adnan Mairaj Malik, Arsalan Nasir, Emaan Mahmud, Fahim Rao, Marium Agha, Mohsin Shaikh, Raheela Abro, S M Raza, Shanzay Subzwari and Zehra Fatima Tooba. 
Now as the names suggest, the participating artists have proved their worth time and again. The most striking thing about the display is the varied styles and subjects that these creative souls deal in and touch upon, respectively. There are traditional pieces done on canvas along with installations made with great technical prowess. However, it’s the diversity and intensity of topics that the artists have selected as their works to be viewed that impresses the most. 
For example, anyone who is interested in detecting the extraordinariness in ordinary, everyday life routines, there are paintings that speak of that very important aspect of 21st century urban existence. Similarly, there are artworks that celebrate life with youthful jubilation. Then on the other side of the content spectrum, certain exhibits speak of an individual’s position in society as well as those that point to the kind of developments taking place in cities which are altering nature’s course in a palpable way. Isn’t that a wide range of themes to mull over… and marvel at?      
The exhibition concludes on Nov 25.

Referring to recent protests by the opposition when he was not allowed by Deputy Speaker Rehana Leghari to speak before Question Hour, he told a press conference that the situation ‘compelled’ the opposition members to gather in front of the speaker’s rostrum and chant anti-government slogans.  

‘Opposition members are excluded from PAC, not allowed to speak in assembly’ 

“I will write a letter to president, prime minister, speaker of National Assembly, chairman of Senate and other stakeholders, including civil society organisations, to let them know about undemocratic attitude of self-proclaimed champions of democracy and alarming situation prevailing in the province,” he said.  
He also appealed to the media to play their role for upholding the sanctity of the house.  
He said that the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) government had turned into an anti-democracy party, particularly in Sindh.  
The manner in which the PPP was running the assembly proceedings showed that the ruling party was no more interested in following rules, norms and traditions, he added.  
“The opposition parties are denied their democratic rights and privileges specified under constitution and rules of business of the legislature,” he said.  
“Entrusting chairmanship of Public Accounts Committee to opposition leader is an important point of charter of democracy that was envisioned by Shaheed Benazir Bhutto. And Syed Khursheed Shah of the PPP and Shahbaz Sharif of Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz had held the same position in the National Assembly as Leader of the Opposition. Contrary to this agreed principal and practice at national level, the PPP in Sindh had not only declined the opposition leader’s appointment as PAC chairman, but they had also not included even a single member from opposition benches in the committee,” he said.  
“The move is aimed at hiding under the carpet several audit objections amounting to over Rs1,400 billion by Auditor General’s office,” he said.

They added that dozens of people gathered outside the area office of the KE led by Jamaat-i-Islami MPA of the constituency Abdul Rasheed. 
As the protesters were chanting slogans for restoration of power, the demonstration came under a gun attack triggering fear in the densely-populated neighbourhood. 
“Three young men namely Farooq Ameer Bux, Mirza Ghaffar and Sohail Muhammad suffered bullet wounds and were taken to the Civil Hospital Karachi,” said an official at the Baghdadi police station adding that all the three injured men were said to be stable. 
The JI Karachi chief along with the party MPA and area workers reached the Civil Hospital and termed the incident a result of an inhuman ‘policy’. 
He alleged that the power utility had suspended the supply to the area for more than 13 hours, which compelled the residents to take to streets.
“It’s now the job of police and the Sindh government to investigate who’s behind this gun attack on a peaceful rally. The KE has become a state within a state and no one from the provincial or the federal governments could dare to question its illegal acts and heavy-handedness,” he said. 
Meanwhile, the KE alleged that its offices were attacked in Lyari when its team in continuation with its massive crackdown aimed against power-thieves and defaulters, disconnected power supply to parts of the area and Malir where the dues cumulatively exceeded Rs2.9 billion. 
“Despite consistent efforts to cooperate with consumers and offer schemes to facilitate them, consumers in Lyari gathered in various pockets of the area to protest against the disconnection of power supply,” it said in a statement. “While the staff members fortunately remained safe, KE’s offices in Moosa Lane and Kalri area were damaged by citizens who pelted stones and threw flammable material causing heavy damage to the utility’s property. The utility has also lodged an FIR against unknown assailants involved in the mob attack.”

Addressing a “Health Conference” under its “Rebuild Karachi Initiative,” city JI chief Hafiz Naeem ur Rahman said that his party had taken up the issue of healthcare system and would be introducing a healthcare charter as part of its election manifesto.
“It’s clear to everyone that the PPP government in Sindh has no healthcare plan for 30 million people of Karachi,” he said. 
“Instead of rebuilding the healthcare system and providing funds to hospitals being run by the KMC, it has started taking over its health facilities. It’s nothing but a fear of the party which call itself champion of democracy,” he said.
“Sooner or later whenever the LG elections are held in Karachi, the PPP would be nowhere. So they want to bring all key institutions under the Sindh government only to misappropriate funds and run its corrupt system,” he said.
The JI invited several distinguished guests from the healthcare sector, who shed light on various problems, their causes, implications and solutions. 
They also lauded the efforts of the JI in this direction. They regretted that both the federal and the provincial governments were not serious in bringing any positive change in the healthcare sector of the province.

This was stated by acting Vice Chancellor Prof Khalid Mahmood Iraqi at a seminar on diabetes on Tuesday.
“It’s so alarming that Pakistan now ranks third in the prevalence of diabetes after China and India. The recent report of the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) reveals that around 33 million people are living with diabetes in Pakistan,” he said.
The university could definitely play a positive role in this situation by encouraging students and teachers to walk instead of using vehicles, he added.
The vice chancellor regretted government indifference towards public health issues and said it’s a fact that authorities did not come up with plans to reduce the growing burden of diabetes.
“Unfortunately, the general public also hasn’t shown much interest in adopting a healthy lifestyle and minimising diabetes ratio in the country. There is a serious need to include diabetes preventive measures in the national health policy,” he said.
Earlier, experts explained to the audience how important it was today to talk about diabetes that affected every second household in the country.
“Pakistan tops the list of countries where gestational diabetes later turns into Type 2 (diabetes). There are a large number of people who have diabetes but they don’t know about it,” said head of the National Association of Diabetes Educators of Pakistan Dr Muhammad Saiful Haque.

Indebted to the ancient vocabulary of Mughal Miniature, Khalid has extended the medium to video, in-situ installation, and immersive textile-based works that offer a critique of global politics and Orientalism, and for that Khalid’s contribution to the contemporary miniature paintings and Pakistani art is immeasurable.
The event will continue from Nov 28 to Jan 8, 2022.
