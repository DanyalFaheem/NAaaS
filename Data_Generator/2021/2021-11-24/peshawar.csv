0,PHC summons federal secys in alternative energy case,Chitral resident challenges felling of trees,"PESHAWAR: A Peshawar High Court bench on Tuesday summoned the federal secretaries of power, finance and science and technology for responding to a petition seeking introduction of alternative sources of energy in forest areas to prevent the use of tree wood as fuel.
Chief Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan and Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim fixed Jan 25 for the next hearing directing the secretaries to appear before them to explain how alternate sources of energy could be introduced in forest areas, especially in Chitral, Swat and Upper and Lower Dir districts.
The bench was hearing a petition filed by an resident of Chitral, Abdur Razak against the felling of trees by the people, especially in the winter season for own use.
He requested the court to issue directives to the relevant officials to check the practice.

Chitral resident challenges felling of trees

The petition was filed last year through advocate Malik Mohammad Ajmal and during its pendency, the chief justice had issued several orders to the relevant officials for devising alternate sources of energy.
During a hearing, the court had directed the energy ministry to produce a report about what alternate sources could be to that of the use of forest wood in the areas.
Subsequently, a report was submitted by the government wherein some alternate sources were discussed including production of energy through cattle dung, use of LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) and taking benefit from the government’s announced winter electricity consumption package.
Director of the energy ministry Abdul Rasheed Jokhio turned up before the bench on behalf of his ministry, whereas additional advocate general Syed Sikandar Hayat Shah appeared for the provincial government.
Advocate Malik Ajmal said the use of LNG was not feasible as it was very expensive and its price is around Rs250 per kg.
The chief justice observed that ruthless felling of trees had been a practice in those areas, especially in the winter season, due to absence of any alternate sources.
The bench observed that it had been asking the government to take the issue seriously and devise a strategy in this regard.
It asked the government representatives why the government had not been introducing solar energy in the forest areas, which will help reduce cutting of trees.
The chief justice observed that with onetime investment in such projects, cheap electricity could be obtained there.
The bench wondered asked who were the concerned officials to summon for discussing this matter including production of solar energy in the forest areas.
Later the bench decided to summon the three federal secretaries so as to devise a plan of introduction of alternate sources of energy in those areas.
The chief justice observed that it was a serious matter and the court would not turn a blind eye towards it.
Malik Ajmal said the Constitution guaranteed that no person should be deprived of life and liberty and in light of the superior courts decisions, the definition of life included the quality of life.
He said the continuous felling of trees left negative impact on the environment in Chitral, Dir, Swat and other forest areas.

4,KP hospitals resume OPD service as Covid cases continue to dip,Health department says the province has been reporting less than 100 Covid cases on average per day for a month.,"PESHAWAR: The public sector hospitals have started providing full-fledged services to people in outpatient departments following decline in Covid-19 cases in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
On Tuesday, three more persons died of the virus and 76 new cases were reported in the province. Two people passed away due to the virus in Peshawar and one in Dera Ismail Khan, according to a report of health department.
The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government had ordered shutting down elective services at hospitals in April 2020 to concentrate on the management of the people infected by Covid-19 and control its transmission.
The hospitals established triages to filter Covid-19 suspected patients and protect health workers from being infected.

Three more die of virus and 76 cases reported in KP

The closure of services at hospitals adversely affected about 200,000 patients, who visited OPDs at about 2,474 health facilities in the province every day to seek treatment.
The health department in April asked the hospitals to reopen OPDs on a limited basis for vaccinated people and most of the hospitals resumed normal OPD service with adherence to Covid-19 standard operating procedure and vaccination.
Officials in the health department said that downtrend in coronavirus cases and mortalities continued as the province had been reporting less than 100 Covid-19 patients and three deaths on average per day for the past month.

They said that most of the hospitals had restarted OPDs service.
Lady Reading Hospital (LRH), which continued to receive 3,000 patients at the accident and emergency department during Covid-19 restrictions, had resumed the OPD service with 2,500 patients per day.
“We allow 2,000 patients to get OPD slip on daily basis and hospitalise emergency patients. A 400-bed Covid-19 complex has been established to receive patients from all over the province. Now Covid-19 situation has eased up so we have resumed OPD service,” LRH spokesman Mohammad Asim told Dawn.
He said that they were vaccinating people before they visited doctors in OPD.
He added that more than 200,000 people were administered the jabs in the hospital.
The director of Bacha Khan Medical Complex in Swabi, Dr Khalid Masud, said that they had started full services for the past one month but patients and their relatives were required to get inoculated and observe Covid-19 precautions.
“All specialised services are available in OPD and patients are admitted for elective services such as surgeries for hernia and gallstones that were not allowed in the recent past by the government due to Covid-19,” he added.
Khyber Teaching Hospital (KTH) and Hayatabad Medical Complex (HMC), which along with LRH managed bulk of the coronavirus patients in the province and stayed closed for non-Covid-19 patients, also restarted full-fledged healthcare services.
Dr Saudul Islam, the associate director of KTH, said that full-scale services had been started at the hospital.
HMC medical director Prof Shehzad Akbar Khan said they provided full services to people and also managed dengue and Corona patients.
“We have played a frontline role in Covid-19 and 18 patients are still being treated as in-patients. We have taken infection control measures and made SOPs mandatory for visiting the hospital,” he added.
Health officials said that resumption of elective services in government health facilities was benefitting the patients, who were totally dependent on the free services.
They said that closure of services in hospitals helped them to put brakes on transmission of virus to health workers.
They said that more than 30 health workers died of Covid-19 while the tally of infected medics was 4,419.
They added that during Covid-19, only elective services stayed closed that could be delayed and caused no harm to the patient but emergency patients were treated as usual at the hospitals.
Officials said that closure of those services at the hospitals enabled them to strengthen emergency service and focus on management of coronavirus patients.

7,"Pakistan can bring Afghan Taliban, US closer: experts",Experts say Pakistan has a unique relationship with Afghanistan and remains the key player in the new scenario.,"PESHAWAR: Speakers at a round table conference have observed that Pakistan can act as a bridge between the Afghan Taliban and the international community, especially the US, as the latter is reluctant to recognise the former’s government in Kabul.
The panelists discussed Afghanistan’s foreign policy under the Taliban, cross-border movement of militants and counter-terrorism, Pakistan’s foreign policy interests and options for Afghanistan, regional stability in Central Asia and Russia, China’s interest, China-Pakistan Economic Corridor/Belt and Road Initiative, US foreign policy options in Afghanistan, according to a statement issued here on Tuesday.
The Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Women University Peshawar organised two parallel round table conferences to discuss the Afghan Taliban’s seizure of power and transformation of the region’s security landscape. The university’s political science department organised the events.
The first discussion was based on the power retrieval of the Taliban in Afghanistan and the challenges faced by them such as their acceptance around world, the brain-drain from Afghanistan, food challenges, and the Afghan foreign reserves frozen by the US government and assistance from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, which has led to many challenges, including protection of human rights, winning of international support, and resolution of economic and humanitarian crises.

Discuss Afghan foreign policy under Taliban, regional issues

The second round table discussed the return of the Afghan Taliban to power and transformation of the security landscape of the region. Apparently, Pakistan, China and Russia will have far more influence than before in the broader Central Asian and South Asian region, the panelists observed.
According to them, while the situation in Afghanistan is still evolving, the Afghan Taliban’s ascendance to power has raised concerns that a revival of militancy could put the region at risk by vitalising the transnational militant groups and threatening foreign investments, those linked to BRI and CPEC.
Pakistan has a unique relationship with Afghanistan and remains the key player in the new scenario. The long history of turbulent relations is defined by cultural and ethnic connections, sovereignty concerns, security interests, and trade. Pakistan has a huge interest in the Afghan Taliban acting firmly and not allowing Afghanistan to descend into an ungoverned space.
The SBBWU and Centre for Global and Strategic Studies (CGSS) Islamabad signed a MoU, which included joint research collaborations, organisation of conferences, and seminars.
The panelists included SBBWUP Vice-Chancellor Prof Razia Sultana, City University of Science and Technology Prof Minhajul Hassan, CGSS chief executive retired Lt-Colonel Khalid Taimur Akram, former ambassador Ayaz Wazir and experts Syed Akhtar Ali Shah, Dr Sadia Suleman, Prof Shabir Ahmad, Imtiaz Guland Dr Raza Rehman.
