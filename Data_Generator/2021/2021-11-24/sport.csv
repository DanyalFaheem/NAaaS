Jorginho, a double European champion with Chelsea and Italy, was joined by club team-mate N’Golo Kante among 11 candidates to be voted FIFAs best player in the 2020-21 season.
Paris St Germain forward Lionel Messi and Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo took their usual places on the list with last year’s winner, Robert Lewandowski of Bayern Munich.
Real Madrid forward Karim Benzema, Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah, Borussia Dortmund striker Erling Haaland, Manchester City playmaker Kevin De Bruyne and PSG pair Kylian Mbappe and Neymar complete the list. 
There are no defenders or goalkeepers in contention for the main FIFA award, though goalkeepers have their own separate award. 
Italy’s Gianluigi Donnarumma, who was named player of the tournament at Euro 2020, is among the five goalkeeping candidates. Liverpool’s Alisson Becker, Chelsea’s Edouard Mendy and Leicester City’s Kasper Schmeichel are also among the nominees.
Thomas Tuchel is a frontrunner for best men’s coach after leading Chelsea to the Champions League title. He faces competition from Roberto Mancini, the mastermind of Italy’s Euro 2020 triumph. 
Other nominees are Germany’s Hansi Flick, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, Tottenham Hots­pur boss Antonio Conte, Diego Sime­one and Lionel Scaloni, whose Arge­ntina team won the Copa America.
The winner of the women’s award last year, England defender Lucy Bronze, is nominated again and the 13 candidates include her national and Manchester City team-mate Ellen White. 
Olympic gold medal-winning Canada have just one candidate, veteran forward Christine Sinclair, 19 years after she was first voted into the top 10. 
No player was nominated from the United States team which took bronze at the Tokyo Olympics. 
Four Barcelona players are included on the women’s best player shortlist — Alexia Putellas, Jennifer Hermoso, Aitana Bonmati and Caroline Graham Hansen. 
Chelsea, beaten by Barcelona in last season’s Women’s Champions League final, also have four representatives with Sam Kerr, Ji So-yun, Magdalena Eriksson and Pernille Harder. 
Arsenal’s Vivianne Miedema is in contention too, as is Stina Blackstenius of Sweden. 
Two men and three women are in contention to be the best coach in women’s football. They include Beverly Priestman of Canada, England manager Sarina Wiegman, Lluis Cortes of European champions Barcelona, and Emma Hayes of Chelsea. 
The prizes for the best men’s and women’s player, coach and goalkeeper are voted for by the captains and coaches of all national teams around the world, as well as an online ballot of fans and a select number of journalists. 
Voting will run from November 22 to December 10.
The three finalists in each category will be revealed in early January, with the awards ceremony to be held virtually from FIFA headquarters in Zurich on January 17 because of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
The separate Ballon d’Or award ceremony will be staged in Paris on November 29.

Speaking at a press conference, Pakistan Volleyball Federation chairman Chaudhry Mohammad Yaqoob about the championship said some incentives for players and winning teams would also be at stake, adding professional incentives would be offered to players when the PVF soon launches its professional league.
“The PVF has a good team to get sponsors and the [planned] league, which will be a replica of Pakistan Super League (PSL), will attract a number of foreign players,” he said.
Pakistan, the PVF chairman reckoned, have all the potential to qualify for the Olympics, provided the government as well as media and sponsors support volleyball.
Chaudhry Yaqoob claimed that Pakistan players have the fitness level and technique possessed by world’s leading volleyball-playing countries, noting the country now are seventh in Asia and 39th in the world rankings.
When asked to comment on the likely impact of the present government’s decision to abolish sports departments from the public sector on the sport, he said several top volleyball players from Wapda,  Railways, Police, HEC, Pakistan Board would be affected due to this policy.
It may be mentioned here that the same policy was not implemented on Army, Navy and PAF.
Chaudhry Yaqoob hoped the government, in the larger national interest, will withdraw the policy of abolishing sports departments.

4,Another former Essex player alleges he suffered racist abuse,LONDON: Another former player of English county Essex has said he suffered racist abuse at the club following...,"LONDON: Another former player of English county Essex has said he suffered racist abuse at the club following allegations made by Zoheb Sharif and Maurice Chambers in the last week.
Jahid Ahmed, who bowled for Essex from 2005-09, told The Cricketer he was bullied by a senior coach and that his accent was mocked by players and some members of the coaching staff.
Jahid’s revelations follow similar claims by Chambers and Sharif. Chambers, who played for Essex between 2005 and 2013, said he was so upset by the racist bullying he faced at the county that he would go home and cry after matches.
“It was a white man’s world where brown people were outsiders,” Jahid, 35, said.  “I wanted to change my voice. I tried to deepen it. I really wanted to fit in.
“I felt like an outsider all the time I was at [Essex’s ground] Chelmsford. I was always fearing what they would come up with and it made it incredibly hard to concentrate on my cricket.”
Essex, who had already opened an investigation after Chambers’ initial claims, said they have established a reporting channel for anyone who experienced abuse at the club.
“The allegations make difficult reading and they will be treated and investigated with the utmost seriousness,” chief executive John Stephenson said.
“I have reached out to him [Jahid] to offer him our full support, and I hope he feels encouraged and comfortable enough to be a part of our imminent investigation.
“It is clear as a sport there is a lot of work to be done, but we are moving in the right direction.
“The next period is going to be extremely difficult, especially for those sharing their experiences, but together, we will come out the other side better for it.”

The picture emerged last week in the wake of former Yorkshire player Azeem Rafiq’s revelations of the career-ending racism he suffered that sent shockwaves through English cricket.
Cricket NSW chief executive Lee Germon, who oversees the Thunder, stressed that there was no room for racism or any form of discrimination in the sport.
But he added in a statement late Monday that the Australian Twenty20 side should also  “accept people who have made mistakes”.
“One of the hallmarks of Thunder’s success is the team embraces diversity and is a club for all,” he said.  “If we really believe that we also must accept people who have made mistakes.
“I’ve spoken to Alex, I’ve watched his apology and have no doubt he is remorseful for the photograph and the other errors of judgement he made as a young man.”
Hales has said the blackface photo, taken at a New Year’s Eve party in 2009, was simply a tribute to his favourite rap artist, Tupac Shakur. But he admitted it was  “disrespectful” and that he  “deplored” racism.
It followed Rafiq telling a British parliamentary committee that Hales, now 32, named his black dog ‘Kevin’ due to cricketer Gary Ballance’s use of the name as a derogatory term. That accusation prompted a  “categorical” denial from Hales.
Germon said he sought the opinion of Hales’ teammates and Thunder staff before giving the opener the green light to return for the new season.

After inspection tours of 22 cities and 23 venues a FIFA delegation will now submit a report from which 16 hosts will be chosen although FIFA’s chief tournaments and events officer Colin Smith suggested that number was not written in stone.
“When the bid was presented 16 was referenced and we’ve taken note but ultimately it is up to FIFA,” said Smith, following a lunch-time media conference on the top floor of a downtown Toronto hotel overlooking Canada’s national stadium BMO Field.
“We’ll wrap up these visits and then we will decide the most appropriate number we need to host the tournament. We haven’t set the exact time [of the venue announcement] yet but I suspect it will be more likely April than March.”
Toronto and Edmonton are the two Canadian cities bidding for games while Guadalajara, Monterrey and Mexico City are the Mexico candidates.
With the 2026 World Cup expanding to a record 48 teams, the joint bid calls for Canada and Mexico to each get 10 games with the rest going to the United States.
Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Cincinnati, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, New York/New Jersey, Orlando, Philadelphia, the San Francisco Bay area, Seattle and Washington, D.C. are potential US venues.
The FIFA delegation looked at everything from infrastructure to legacy projects to stadiums and practice facilities.
“Overall we have been absolutely delighted with the quality of the presentations,” said Smith.  “It has been a very competitive process, one that is going to make our decision all the more harder.”
Vancouver, venue for the 2015 Women’s World Cup final, has expressed late interest in getting in on the World Cup action but Victor Montagliani, the CONCACAF president and FIFA vice-president, on Monday threw cold water on the suggestion.
“I know that the premier of British Columbia [John Horgan] had expressed some interest and that’s great,” said Montagliani, who was joined at the head table by Smith, Toronto Mayor John Tory and Lisa MacLeod, Ontarios Minister of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture.  “But right now were dealing with the players we have, not the players that are not on the team.”

12,Rain shortens play in Galle as WI avoid follow-on,GALLE: Rain forced an early end with the West Indies tail still hanging on after avoiding the follow-on for day ...,"GALLE: Rain forced an early end with the West Indies tail still hanging on after avoiding the follow-on for day three of the first Test against Sri Lanka here at the Galle International Stadium on Tuesday.
The West Indies added nine runs in 30 balls and lost Rahkeem Cornwall in a brief passage of play after lunch before the heavens opened. The forecast for the next two days was more wet weather.
With the new ball due, Suranga Lakmal was called up to bowl the 79th over of the West Indies innings from the City End and he dismissed Cornwall.
Lakmal bowled a short ball and Cornwall could not resist the pull shot, but got the execution wrong and was caught by Ramesh Mendis running backwards from mid-wicket. Cornwall made 39 off 58 balls with five fours and a six.
But the 49-run stand between Cornwall and Joshua da Silva ensured the West Indies avoided the follow-on.
After a brief pause in the rain, umpires inspected the field and decided to resume play. Another downpour soon washed out the final session before it began, threatening to spoil Sri Lanka’s early advantage.
“We are hoping and praying the weather gods are kind to us,” said Sri Lanka spin bowling coach Piyal Wijetunga, who was disappointed his spinners had failed to dispatch the tourists before the rain, despite accounting for eight wickets between them.
“Not a hundred percent happy with the way we went about things,” he said.
“The boys are excited and they try too many things without sticking to basics. Patience is the key and they need to learn.”
Play will resume early for the final two days to make up lost time, with 98 overs scheduled for each.
Earlier, Sri Lanka had posted 386 all out after electing to bat first.
Skipper Dimuth Karunaratne scored his 13th Test hundred, going on to make 147 while Dhananjaya de Silva (61) and Pathum Nissanka (56) scored half-centuries.
The West Indies collapsed to 113 for six at stumps on day two but recovered thanks to a rearguard action by the lower order. Kyle Mayers (45), Jason Holder (36) and Cornwall (39) all chipped in.
The side’s only warm-up game ahead of the series, a four-day match against Board President’s XI in Colombo, was called off without a ball being bowled, due to rain.

13,Cricket Tasmania slams ‘appalling’ Paine treatment,Cricket Tasmania chair Andrew Gaggin says Cricket Australia should have shown him more loyalty.,"SYDNEY: Cricket Tasmania launched a scathing attack on the sport’s Australian governing body Tuesday over its  “appalling” treatment of former Test skipper Tim Paine, saying anger in the community was  “palpable”.
Paine, who was born and bred in Tasmania, tearfully quit as captain on Friday ahead of the Ashes against England over a series of lewd text messages with a female colleague in 2017 that were about to be made public.
He insisted he wasn’t pushed out, but Cricket Tasmania chair Andrew Gaggin said Cricket Australia should have shown him more loyalty.
“In conversations I have had in recent days it is clear that the anger amongst the Tasmanian cricket community and general public is palpable,” he said in a statement.
“Tim Paine has been a beacon for Australian cricket over the past four years and instrumental in salvaging the reputation of the national team after the calamity of Cape Town.
“Yet, at a time when CA should have supported Tim, he was evidently regarded as dispensable.”
Paine took over in March 2018 in the wake of the  “sandpaper-gate” scandal that rocked Australian cricket.
Then-captain Steve Smith and his deputy David Warner were forced to step down for their roles in trying to alter the condition of the ball during a Cape Town Test against South Africa.
Gaggin branded Paine’s treatment by CA  “appalling — the worst since Bill Lawry over 50 years ago”.
Lawry became the first Australian Test cricket captain to be dropped from a team midway through the 1970-71 series against England — finding out from reporters.
Australia’s cricket authorities investigated the sexting allegations against Paine in 2018 and cleared him of any code of conduct breach.
However at the weekend, current Cricket Australia chair Richard Freudenstein, who was elected to the board in 2019, said it was a mistake not to axe him at the time.
Gaggin said Paine  “should not have been put in a position where he felt the need to resign over an incident that was determined by an independent inquiry at the time to not be a breach of the code of conduct”.
TOO CLOSE
Meanwhile, chief selector George Bailey will step aside from voting on whether Paine should remain in the team as a player if there is a split decision, given they have a close personal and business relationship.
Despite relinquishing the captaincy, Paine still wants to be considered for selection as wicket-keeper for the opening Ashes Test in Brisbane on December 8.
The decision will be made by a three-man selection panel comprising Bailey, coach Justin Langer and the recently appointed Tony Dodemaide.
“If the panel was not in agreeance with Tim’s position going forward and it was going to come down to a vote, then I would step aside and leave that to Tony and Justin to work through,” Bailey said on the Cricket Etc podcast.
Working against Paine is a lack of match practice after invasive surgery in September for pain in his neck and left arm due to a bulging disc.
He made his return for Tasmania’s second XI on Monday, grabbing six catches.
If selectors opt against him, Alex Carey is seen as favourite to take the gloves in Brisbane.

14,New Zealand ponder ‘enormity’ of India challenge,NEW DELHI: New Zealand open their World Test Championship defence against India this week with an air of fatigue...,"NEW DELHI: New Zealand open their World Test Championship defence against India this week with an air of fatigue after a long road trip and the emotional letdown of the T20 World Cup.
Whitewashed 3-0 by India in a T20 series on the heels of their World Cup final defeat by Australia, the ‘Black Caps’ have lost that winning feeling as they head into the first Test in Kanpur on Thursday against an opponent bent on revenge.
New Zealand may have golden memories of beating India in Southampton to claim the inaugural WTC trophy in June but the neutral territory of the Rose Bowl can hardly seem further away.
Without pace spearhead Trent Boult and all-rounder Colin de Grandhomme, New Zealand will face the same opponents where they have never won a Test series let alone a test since the 1988/89 tour.
“You realise the enormity of the challenge ahead,” head coach Gary Stead told reporters on Tuesday. “India are a fantastic side. They’ve got world class spinners in their environment here as well.
“[They are] one of the great challenges on the Test calendar. Its something we haven’t done for a while, we haven’t been here since 2016 but were certainly looking forward to what’s ahead.”
New Zealand will have only two training sessions as a full squad before Thursday, with the T20 players having rejoined the camp on Monday following the defeat in Kolkata.
A number of players are well short of match fitness, including batsman Ross Taylor and paceman Neil Wagner. 
Selectors have yet to decide who will replace batsman Devon Conway for the first Test after he broke his hand punching his bat at the World Cup.
“We’re as prepared as we can be in this Covid world,” said Stead. “India are also coming off a T20 series ... Hopefully for us they are in a similar boat to what we are as well.”
New Zealand’s four-prong pace attack reigned supreme in the last Covid-affected WTC cycle but the Black Caps will be unable to fall back on their traditional strengths in Kanpur and Mumbai.
They will hope left-arm spinner Ajaz Patel and offspinner Will Somerville can pressure India’s powerful batting lineup, with all-rounder Mitch Santner also likely to be on hand with left-arm spin.

16,‘UAE can be perfect venue for Pakistan-India bilateral cricket’,ISLAMABAD: Dubai Cricket Council (DCC) chairman Abdul Rahman Falaknaz reckons the UAE could be the perfect neutral...,"ISLAMABAD: Dubai Cricket Council (DCC) chairman Abdul Rahman Falaknaz reckons the UAE could be the perfect neutral venue for Pakistan-India bilateral series, saying the game of cricket brings people together.
After hosting the second half of the Indian Premier League (IPL) and then the ICC Twenty20 World Cup, DCC has expressed its desire to host Pakistan-India bilateral games.
The DCC chairman could not hide his joy when asked to reflect on UAE’s resounding success in hosting a cricket World Cup.
“First of all, as an Emirati, I am very proud. You know, the most amazing thing is that an Arab country hosted a cricket World Cup. And this was not understood at all by anybody. Nobody even thought that there would be facilities in the Arab world to host cricket because this is not our game,” Falaknaz said while talking to local media in Dubai as quoted by khaleejtimes.com.
“But there are people who have played the game. I played in India. In fact, I played quite well for my school [in Mumbai]. My manager at that time said if I had stayed in India, I could have played for India. That’s what he told me when I was 16 years old!” Falaknaz, whose brother-in-law, Sultan Zarawani captained the UAE in the 1996 World Cup, offered to break the deadlock in Pakistan-India bilateral cricket. The arch-rivals haven’t engaged in bilateral duels since 2013.
But Falaknaz believes the UAE could be the perfect neutral venue for the two countries.
“The best thing would be to get India-Pakistan matches here. When Sharjah used to host India and Pakistan all those years ago, it was like a war. But it was a good war, it was a sporting war and it was fantastic,” he said.
“I remember Raj Kapoor came once with his family. During the awards night, he took the mic and said, how wonderful it is to have these India-Pakistan battles in Sharjah. Cricket brings people together, cricket has brought us together and let us remain this way. So this is what we would like to do. If we can convince India to come and play here against Pakistan once a year or twice a year, it would be fantastic.”
With the NBA making the ground-breaking announcement to bring their bandwagon to the UAE for a couple of matches from the next year, this country’s position as a global sporting hub was further enhanced.
Falaknaz said the Indian cricket board should also take a leaf out of NBA’s book by hosting a few Indian Premier League (IPL) matches every year in the UAE.
“It all depends on the BCCI to decide what they want to do. We are very friendly with them. They have seen our potential. I would invite them to come and hold their IPL, start here and finish in India or start in India and finish in Dubai,” Falaknaz remarked.

17,Hameed hits unbeaten 53 as England begin Ashes warm-ups,Rain restricted the opening day to just 29 overs.,"BRISBANE: Haseeb Hameed hit an unbeaten 53 and Rory Burns 39 as England began their Ashes tour in a low-key and rain-hit intra-squad warm-up game Tuesday, played against the backdrop of a racism scandal back home.
Test superstars Joe Root, Stuart Broad, Jimmy Anderson and Ben Stokes were among the first wave of players to land in Brisbane on November 6 with their Twenty20 World Cup contingent jetting in later.
They have completed 14 days quarantine at a Gold Coast resort and experienced their first real taste of Australian conditions in the informal three-day game against England Lions at Peter Burge Oval.
But rain restricted the opening day to just 29 overs.
Hameed struck eight boundaries and Burns found the ropes four times as an England XI made 98 without loss after winning the toss and opting to bat Zak Crawley is scheduled to come in at three followed by skipper Root, Stokes then Ollie Pope.
While Broad was on the team sheet, his veteran fast-bowling partner Anderson was not.
Other absent Ashes squad members included Johnny Bairstow, Jos Buttler, Dawid Malan and Mark Wood, who all played at the T20 World Cup.

The report quoted Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) chief physician Debashish Chowdhury as saying Tamim would need a month’s rest to recover from the injury he picked up last month.
Tamim, who opted out of this year’s Twenty20 World Cup citing a lack of game time as he recovered from a knee injury, was last week ruled out of Bangladesh’s two-test home series against Pakistan, which starts on Friday, due to the injury.
Bangladesh are due to play the first Test against New Zealand at Bay Oval in Mount Maunganui from Jan 1 followed by the second match at Hagley Oval in Christchurch from Jan 9.

19,Khalid H. Khan and his effervescent brilliance will be forever missed,"“Khalid was widely respected and well-loved amongst his peers, players and administrators,"" says PCB Chairman Ramiz Raja.","IN our very first meeting on a cold winter evening at the Dawn office, Khalid H. Khan asked me if I knew the full name of Sri Lankan pace bowler Chaminda Vaas. It was the question he used to ask every new induction at the sports desk. The scoreboards he sent forward for publishing on the pages were always meticulous in detail; he used to give the full initials of each player. And Vaas’ were the longest. W.P.U.J.C. Vaas was how he would go on the scoreboard. 
Of course I didn’t know. But Khalid bhai, as he was known across the cricketing and sports media community of the country, of course knew not only Vaas’ full name but also of every other cricketer that has played the game. Over the years, thanks to him, I know that Vaas’ full name is Warnakalusuriya Patabendige Ushantha Joseph Chaminda Vaas. That isn’t the only thing I learnt from him. He would’ve been proud if I told him I’d finally learnt Vaas’ full name only a few days ago. Unfortunately I’d never get the chance to tell him that. 
Khalid bhai passed away on Tuesday afternoon at the age of 58 after suffering a cranial hemorrhage over two weeks ago, leaving behind not only a huge void for his friends, family and co-workers as well as Dawn but also for cricket in the country. 
“Khalid was widely respected and well-loved amongst his peers, players and administrators for his deep affection for domestic cricket and support for the emerging cricketers and leading performers,” Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ramiz Raja said in the board’s condolence message. Ramiz wasn’t the only one who paid tribute to him. 
Pakistan cricket star Shahid Afridi took to Twitter say “Khalid bhai was a gentle and wonderful journalist who always supported domestic cricket and performers”. 

 



 
Former Pakistan Test captain Azhar Ali spoke about his passion for the game. Such was his standing that a lot of cricketers would turn to him for advice when going through a rough patch in the game. 
Such was Khalid bhai’s love for domestic cricket that he would protest when we’d ask him to file a shorter story on the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy matches because of paucity of space. “This is the tournament from where the stars of the future come from,” he would contest. In his 24 years at Dawn, he never missed reporting on a Trophy match. It was only when he became critically ill recently that he missed out on that. 
Only a day before he passed out and had to subsequently be put on the ventilator, he told me during our meeting at the hospital that he will be filing a roundup of the matches. That too, despite the doctors having asked him to take complete rest. Such was passion for covering the game he loved. He filed his last report on the Trophy matches from the hospital bed on Nov 8. 
“No journalist in the country has covered domestic cricket as thoroughly and dedicatedly as Khalid did,” veteran cricket reporter Qamar Ahmed said on Tuesday. “His devotion was unparalleled.” 
Khalid bhai’s copy was always spot on, but he made sure we read it carefully “just so there are no missing words”. When he would write a punchy intro to a story, he’d call me over to his desk terminal to ask if it needed any changing. Usually, they didn’t. But when it did, Khalid bhai would always say that he needs to go back to reading to keep up with the times.
A livewire on the desk, he had an infectious smile that would light up the room. A proficient sub-editor as well, he was Mr. Dependable at the desk. Never would a strike in the city, or even heavy rains, prevent Khalid bhai from strolling into the office as if everything was okay. Khalid bhai would always find a way. If you ran into an emergency and couldn’t come to office, it was no big deal if he was there.  
A loving husband and a doting father to his four daughters, Khalid bhai spent his early childhood in Sri Lanka due to his father’s posting in the foreign service. That, he said, helped him memorise the names of Sri Lankan cricketers as he said his classmates had similarly long names. Sri Lanka was his second team and he’d fondly recall his last trip to the island country during the 2011 Cricket World Cup, when he visited his elementary school and met his friends there. 
He’d also recall his interview with cricket great Sir Vivian Richards during the Pakistan Super League with great fondness, saying it was “a dream come true”. So much so, he’d posted a picture of him and the West Indian great taken after the interview on the softboard on the desk. There are other pictures too, of him with former Pakistan captains Younis Khan and Rashid Latif.
Those pictures will continue to remind us of the brilliant man Khalid bhai was.
