1,"Stocks lose over 1,500 points in two days","KARACHI: Bears overpowered the bulls in the stock market once again on Tuesday, as investors responded to the latest...","KARACHI: Bears overpowered the bulls in the stock market once again on Tuesday, as investors responded to the latest round of monetary tightening, which took the six-month interbank interest rate to double digits.
According to Arif Habib Ltd, the steep rise in the Karachi Interbank Offered Rate (Kibor) will lead to a hefty increase in the finance cost of businesses that have borrowed heavily from banks. The increase in the interest rate will eventually lower companies’ profits as a major portion of borrowing is benchmarked against Kibor.
Investors remained under pressure on the second day of the rollover week and opted for squaring off their positions. In the last trading hour, however, across-the-board selling was witnessed on the stock exchange.
As a result, the benchmark KSE-100 index lost 796.48 points, or 1.74 per cent, to close at 44,948.52.

2,CDWP clears six projects worth Rs61.24bn,"Three smaller projects approved by CDWP relate to industries, commerce sector and will be located in Balochistan’s border areas.","ISLAMABAD: The Central Development Working Party (CDWP) on Tuesday cleared a total of six development projects worth Rs61.24 billion, including three major road and transport projects for the Rawalpindi region.
A meeting of the CDWP presided over by Planning Commission’s Deputy Chairman Mohammad Jehanzeb Khan formally approved three development projects with a total estimated cost of Rs600 million and recommended three projects worth Rs60.64bn to the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) for approval.
Under the current financial powers, the CDWP can itself approve projects costing no more than Rs10bn, whereas the projects of higher estimated costs are approved by Ecnec once the CDWP clears them on technical grounds.
Three smaller projects approved by the CDWP relate to the industries and commerce sector and would be located in Balochistan’s border areas. These included the establishment of joint border markets at Gabd district in Gwadar (at a cost of Rs226.585m), at Mand district in Keh (Rs183.9m), and at Ghedhi district in Panjgur (Rs184.5m).
The project – aimed at constructing markets along the Pakistan-Iran border – is based on a memorandum of understanding signed between the governments of the two countries to establish six markets. Three marketplaces will be set up in the first phase.
The project intends to promote trade between local people to support their livelihood.
Mr Jehanzeb asked the agencies concerned to improve the enabling environment for trade on border areas, especially for regional trade. The focus must be on government’s coordination, trade promotion infrastructure, automation of government-to-business interaction in order to reduce cost and increase transparency and implementation support.
The meeting recommended three larger projects in the transport and communications sector to Ecnec for approval at an estimated cost of Rs60.64bn.
The first project included the construction of Rawalpindi Ring Road-R3 main carriageway from Baanth (N-5) to Thalian (M-2) worth Rs23.606bn. The sponsoring agency of this controversial project is the government of Punjab and its executing agency is the Rawalpindi Development Authority.
Out of the total PC-I cost, the federal government would contribute Rs15.165bn while the provincial government will pitch in Rs8.441bn. The project envisages the construction of the six-lane access-controlled Rawalpindi Ring Road measuring 38.3 kilometres.
The scope of work also includes the construction of grade-separated five interchanges, two bridges, a flyover and two subways besides an intelligent transportation system, fence on both sides of the right of way (ROW), toll plazas and weighbridges.
The second project — concerning the land acquisition for Lai expressway and flood channel in Rawalpindi — is worth Rs24.960bn and pushed by Interior Minister Shaikh Rasheed Ahmed.
The project envisages acquisition of 750 kanals of land to provide ROW for the construction of Lai Nullah Expressway and Flood Channel Project. The whole Nullah Lai project spans over 16.5km, i.e. from Katarian Bridge to Soan River near the high court and would constitute an integral part of the transportation network of Rawalpindi besides flood mitigation and sewage disposal.
The scope and cost also include compensation to be provided to the built-up properties and charges for shifting and idle time compensation.
Another project relating to the feasibility study and construction of 10th Avenue from IJP Road to Srinagar Highway, Islamabad, is worth Rs12.08bn. As per the master plan, 10th Avenue is a part of the Islamabad road network.
The project seeks to provide better traffic facilities and savings in travel time and vehicle operating costs, avoid inconvenience to the general public, avoid security hazards, and reduce the risk of accidents. Ultimately, the project aims to help reduce air and noise pollution through reduced traffic congestions.
The road will also provide a link to the railway dry port, the industrial area of Islamabad, and to the Islamabad International Airport through the Srinagar Highway. It is also envisaged that traffic from N-5 through the Margalla road will also use this road to reach the middle of the twin cities and industrial area which will be the nearest approach.

6,Protocol signed for export of onion to China,The two sides reaffirm that such initiatives will further strengthen relations between the two countries.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan will export onion to China under a protocol signed on Tuesday, paving the way for more Pakistani agriculture products to reach Chinese markets.  
The protocol for inspection and quarantine requirements for export of onion from Pakistan to China between the Department of Plant Protection (DPP) and General Administration of Customs China (GACC) was signed by Minister for National Food Security and Research Syed Fakhr Imam and Chinese Ambassador Nong Rong in Islamabad.  
The two sides reaffirmed that such initiatives would further strengthen relations between the two countries. Such trade-related memorandums of understanding would bring the people of the two countries even closer to each other, a statement said at the end of the ceremony.  
Under the protocol, the DPP will conduct pest surveys and implement internationally recognised and integrated pest management practices during the growing season of onion to ensure pest-free export of the produce to China.  
The processing companies willing to export onion to China will be registered and recommended by DPP after the approval through audit for further registration with GACC.  
The work on the development of quarantine and phytosanitary procedures for export of Pakistani onion to China was initiated in January, 2019. The National Plant Protection Organisations of both countries conducted Pest Risk Analysis (PRA) and technical negotiations resulted in the form of protocol during April 2021.  
In order to ensure safe entry of onion from Pakistan to China and to prevent introduction of pests and to protect plant health under provisions of the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS agreement) of the World Trade Organisation, the two countries agreed to sign the protocol.  
Speaking at the protocol signing ceremony, Mr Fakhar Imam said that Pakistan with around 138,000 hectares and 1.8 million tons of onion production stands at the sixth and ninth positions in terms of area under cultivation and production, respectively.  
Mr Imam said that Pakistan had been exporting rice, mango and citrus to China after complying with import requirements of China. 
The current protocol would also create awareness about quarantine and phytosanitary compliance among Pakistan’s onion producers.  
Chinese Ambassador Nong Rong said the protocol would open new ways for more Pakistani agriculture products to reach Chinese markets.  
The two countries back each other and China is already supporting Pakistan for control of foot and mouth disease, and potato, beef and mutton production. 
The China-Pakistan Econ­omic Corridor would result in improvement in such trade ties, he added.
