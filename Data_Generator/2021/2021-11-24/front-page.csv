• Ex-CJP’s audio leak termed work of Maryam’s social media team
• Minister claims prices of food items have reduced significantly
ISLAMABAD: The federal cabinet on Tuesday established a ministerial committee for holding the 2023 general elections through electronic voting machines (EVMs), in which over nine million overseas Pakistanis will exercise their right of franchise for the first time. 
The committee comprises Adviser to the Prime Minister on Parliamentary Affairs Dr Babar Awan, Railways Minister Azam Swati, Minister for Science and Technology Shibli Faraz, Minister for Information Technology Aminul Haq and the attorney general. 
It will also address the concerns of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
The weekly cabinet meeting, presided over by Prime Minister Imran Khan, thoroughly discussed the issue of the recent audio leak of former Supreme Court chief justice Saqib Nisar. The meeting termed the audio “fake and fabricated”, claiming it to have been engineered by the “social media team of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Vice President Maryam Nawaz”. 
An inquiry commission report on the 2020 oil crisis/hoarding of petroleum products was also presented before the cabinet which revealed that oil marketing companies had illegally earned Rs5.52 billion through hoarding. 
According to the report, owners of over 2,000 petrol pumps had illegally benefited from the scam.
In his post-cabinet meeting press conference, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said: “The cabinet reiterated the government’s resolve to hold the next general elections through EVMs at all costs.” 
He said a ministerial committee would keep in touch with the ECP to ensure implementation of the recently-passed laws on electoral reforms. 
“The committee will finalise the nitty-gritty on the use of EVMs in the next elections such as cost and numbers of machines,” he added. 
Although the ECP had already raised questions over the use of EVMs, the minister said the entire nation, including the government, opposition and public, wanted the existing electoral system to be reformed. 
He said both the PML-N and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) were against the use of EVMs and giving voting rights to overseas Pakistanis. 
On a lighter note, Fawad Chaudhry said both sons of Nawaz Sharif, who had never participated in an election in Pakistan, would be able to cast their votes.   
Audio leak
The information minister blamed Maryam Nawaz for the fake leaks, saying, “she remained involved in producing fake videos and had formed a special team for the purpose.” 
He said she might have also prepared videos of some PML-N leaders to keep them under her control. 
He said the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) strongly condemned this act and hoped that the issue would reach to its logical conclusion and the government would follow the court’s directives on the matter. 
Prices of food items
Mr Chaudhry claimed prices of food items had come down significantly but media was reporting otherwise. 
“Sugar is being sold between Rs90 and Rs95 and the price is expected to come down to Rs80-85 per kg in the coming weeks,” he said, adding that prices of tomatoes, onions and garlic had also decreased substantially. 
He said the government had launched two programmes to provide relief to people but prices of commodities in Sindh, especially Karachi, were still high. 
Mr Chaudhry said Sindh was asked to release wheat and start sugarcane crushing in time but it did not follow the directives, adding that 40 per cent of the Sensitive Price Index’s inflation data consisted of Karachi’s figures. 
He said in Lahore, a wheat flour bag of 20kg was available for Rs1,100 whereas in Karachi it was costing Rs1,460. 
In the same way, the price of sugar in Karachi was Rs107 whereas in major cities of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the commodity was available for Rs90 per kg.
He said the federal government had been importing wheat worth $700 million, while on the other hand, the Sindh government was claiming that its wheat was being stolen. 
Seminars
The minister said a series of seminars were held in Lahore and Islamabad last week which had received funding from abroad. On the other hand, the Supreme Court Bar Association, in its press release, had distanced itself from the speeches made against judiciary at a conference in Lahore, he added. The minister said the Islamabad Capital Territory Local Government Ordinance 2021 had also received approval to pave way for holding of LG elections in the federal capital. 
About cadastral mapping of state land, Mr Chaudhry said the Sindh government had refused to share data in this regard. 
“The reason for the refusal was that the state’s forest land worth over Rs5,000 billion was in illegal occupation in Sindh,” he said, adding that land worth Rs5.6 trillion had been retrieved and forests would be grown on it. 
Responding to a query, the information minister said the PTI was the only party which had submitted complete record of foreign funding to the ECP.
Likewise, PM Khan had also presented his money trail in the court, Mr Chaudhry said, adding that the Election Commission should seek details of foreign funding from other political parties. 
The minister said the federal cabinet allowed transportation of Indian food assistance to Afghanistan via Pakistan.

1,PTI senator resigns to make way for Tarin,ISLAMABAD: PTI lawmaker Ayub Afridi was appointed as adviser to the prime minister on overseas Pakistanis hours ...,"ISLAMABAD: PTI lawmaker Ayub Afridi was appointed as adviser to the prime minister on overseas Pakistanis hours after resigning as Senator to pave way for Shaukat Tarin’s entry into the house to become finance minister again.
“This [seat] was entrusted to me by the party and the prime minister and I happily returned it,” Mr Afridi said in a video message from the parliament after his resignation was accepted by the Senate chairman.
Mr Afridi explained that he had been asked by Prime Minister Imran Khan to resign, but had been told to wait due to the joint session of the parliament.
Informed sources say the government plans to get Shaukat Tarin, the premier’s finance adviser, elected to the Senate on the seat vacated by Mr Afridi to ensure that he becomes finance minister again.
Mr Tarin was appointed as finance minister on April 17 and his constitutional term as a non-elected minister ended on October 16 following which he was appointed as finance adviser to the PM.
Under the Constitution, in order to continue as finance minister for more than six months, Mr Tarin needed to be elected to the parliament.
The government earlier had the plans to get him elected to the upper house on PML-N leader Ishaq Dar’s seat, when it falls vacant under the provision of an ordinance, which could not happen due to legal hitches.
Under the presidential ordinance of September 1, a lawmaker who willfully does not take oath within 40 days of promulgation of the ordinance will cease to hold the office. Mr Dar had however written a letter to the ECP pleading that the rule was not applicable to him.
He said that the ECP had issued a notification regarding his election as a senator, which was suspended by the Supreme Court on May 8, 2018. He said his case was still pending in the apex court and he was in no position to take the oath of Senate until the suspension order held the field. He said he would take the oath when the suspension order was withdrawn.
The government had previously tried to get former finance minister Dr Abdul Hafeez Shaikh, who was also not a member of the parliament, elected to the Senate.
Mr Shaikh was appointed as finance minister in December 2020 and was the government’s candidate for the hotly contested general seat from Islamabad in March’s Senate elections.
But in a blow to the government, Mr Shaikh lost to the joint opposition’s candidate Yousuf Raza Gilani – a result which led PM Imran to seek a vote of confidence from the National Assembly to show that he still held the majority.
Mr Shaikh was later removed as finance minister on March 29 and replaced by the PTI’s Hammad Azhar, who was shortly replaced by Mr Tarin.

2,Bureaucrat faces FIA probe over social media text deriding govt,Senior joint secretary of cabinet division drew parallels between PTI govt & Afghan Taliban,"ISLAMABAD: The prime minister has appointed the director general of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to conduct an inquiry against a senior civil servant for drawing parallels between the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government and the Afghan Taliban.
Senior Joint Secretary of Cabinet Division Hammad Shamimi circulated a sarcastic text among his contacts through a social media platform in which he stated: “PTI government and Taliban regime resemble as both are confused how to run the government after assuming power, and both pin hopes on Aabpara.”
Aabpara is a metaphor for the premier intelligence agency of Pakistan.
According to sources, the officer shared the message among some WhatsApp groups which was forwarded to the relevant quarters.

Senior joint secretary of cabinet division drew parallels between PTI govt & Afghan Taliban  

Following the development, Sec­retary of Establishment Divi­sion Afzal Latif issued the order about an inquiry against the officer.
The order stated: “The Prime Minister in his capacity as ‘Authority’ is pleased to appoint Mr Sanaullah Abbasi (PSP/BS-22) as Inquiry Officer to conduct inquiry proceedings against Mr Hammad Shamimi, senior joint secretary, Cabinet Division Islamabad.”
The FIA DG has been authorised to proceed against Mr Sham­imi under Civil Servants (Efficie­ncy and Discipline) Rules, 2020.
The inquiry order, which has also been widely circulated on social media and mainstream media, further stated that the inquiry would be completed within 60 days from the date of issuance of the order or within such extended period which the Authority might allow.
The FIA DG has been directed to submit a report to the Authority within seven days of the completion of inquiry with findings as to whether the charge has been proved or not and with recommendations regarding exoneration or imposition of minor or major penalty on the accused officer.
As per statement of allegations, Mr Shamimi has been accused of making “highly objectionable comments on social media platform/group in violation of Rule 22 of the Government Servants (Conduct) Rules, 1964 and instructions contained in Para 4(iii), (iv) and (v) of the guiding instructions on use of social media by government servants issued by Establishment Division vide Office Memorandum…which is tantamount to misconduct under Civil Servants (Efficiency and Discipline) Rules, 2020”.
According to the guidelines on social media government servants have been barred from appearing on any media platform except with the permission of the government.
The notification on the guidelines had said that instructions were not intended “to discourage any constructive and positive use of social media by a government organisation for engaging the people to solicit feedback on a government policy, suggestions for improvement in service delivery and resolution of their complaints”.
“But such an organisation shall maintain their social media platforms continuously or frequently to remove offensive, inappropriate and objectionable remarks,” it had said.
The notification had given detailed instructions to government employees under Government Servants (Conduct) Rules, 1964, governing participation of government servants in different media forums, including social media platforms, for compliance.
Referring to Rule 22 of the Servant Rules, Establishment Division had said: “The rule restrains a government servant from making any statement of fact or opinion which is capable of embarrassing the government in any document published or in any communication made to the press or in any public utterance or television programme or radio broadcast delivered by him or her.”
The notification had warned government servants that violation of these instructions would be tantamount to misconduct and lead to disciplinary action against delinquent government servant under Civil Servants (Efficiency and Discipline) Rules, 2020. Besides, disciplinary proceedings would also be held against government servants in case they are administrators of a social media group where any violation has been committed.

3,PM Imran launches system to check tax evasion in sugar industry,Premier hopes revenue collection figure will reach Rs8 trillion.,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Tuesday inaugurated a track and trace system (TTS) of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).  
The TTS will help the government monitor the movement of sugar from factories in order to check tax evasion. 
The sugar industry has emerged as the second sector after cigarettes to be brought under the electronic monitoring system. The FBR is planning to bring the beverage, cement, fertiliser, iron and petroleum sectors under this system.  
Speaking on the occasion, the prime minister said that people had no trust in the tax system of the country, but he did not elaborate on the measures his government had taken for restoring people’s confidence in the tax system over the past three years.  
He said that Pakistan was the fifth biggest country in terms of giving charity. “I am the biggest beneficiary of this system,” he said, adding that the people preferred to give charity, but they were not willing to pay taxes.  
“FBR will have to play a role in restoring the confidence of the people in the tax system,” he added.  
Mr Khan said the biggest problem facing the country was scarcity of resources to run its affairs. “We resort to taking loans for paying our debt and servicing it,” he said, adding that the sustainability of state was at risk.  
“We can’t go on like this. We are stuck in vicious circles. We need to go for the use of technology to generate maximum revenue.”  
The prime minister said the FBR was expected to collect Rs6 trillion in taxes during the current financial year. Of this, he said, Rs3tr would be used for the retirement and servicing of debts but the remaining amount was insufficient for infrastructure development, and health and education spending in the country.  
Mr Khan expressed the hope that the revenue collection figure would reach Rs8tr.  
He stressed the need for promoting and strengthening tax culture in the country by assuring the people that their taxes would be spent on welfare of their children and not on the luxuries of rulers.  
The prime minister claimed that the TTS would ensure transparency in the tax collection and help restore people’s confidence. 
Adviser to the PM on Finance and Revenue Shaukat Tarin said 76 companies had signed up for the TTS so far. The FBR and National Database and Registration Authority were working on broadening the tax base through the use of modern technology, he added. 
Mr Tarin said around 15 million people had been identified who could be brought into the tax net. 
The TTS will ensure electronic monitoring of the production and sale in tobacco, fertiliser, sugar and cement sectors. This will help bring transparency to the system and enhance the country’s revenue collection. 
Under the system, no production bag of sugar will be taken out from the factory and manufacturing plant without a stamp and individual identity mark from Nov 11. The FBR has already notified this through specific rules. 
The unique identification markings (UIMs) are to be obtained/procured from FBR’s Licensee AJCL/MITAS/Authentix Consortium.  
The Sales Tax Act, 1990, read with Rule 150 ZF of the Sales Tax Rules, 2006, mandates the FBR to notify the date for the implementation of Electronic Monitoring of Production and Sales of Goods in the manner prescribed in the law on all manufacturing sites of notified sectors.

4,PDM fails to firm up plan for anti-government drive,Maulana Fazl says heads of component parties to meet on Dec 6 to “announce very important decisions”.,"ISLAMABAD: The opposition Pakistan Democratic Movement on Tuesday again failed to come out with a plan to launch its announced anti-government protest campaign as PDM president Maulana Fazlur Rehman after presiding over a meeting of the heads of the component parties declared that they would again meet on December 6 after which they would make “a final policy” and “announce very important decisions”.  
“Today we had a detailed debate on the prevailing situation in the country. Next meeting of the PDM heads will be held in Islamabad on December 6. Before this meeting, all the component parties will prepare their recommendations [regarding launching of the anti-government protest movement] after holding in-house consultations in their respective decision-making and powerful bodies,” Maulana Fazl said while talking to reporters after the nearly four-hour long meeting which was also attended by supreme leader of the Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N) Nawaz Sharif and party president Shehbaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz via video link.  

          View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Churail Sarwat (@sarwatg)

 
The Maulana smilingly evaded repeated questions asked by over-enthusiastic reporters about the possible long march and en masse resignations from the assemblies, by simply telling them to wait till December 6. “The time is not too far. We will move towards final and last decisions to rid the nation of the present oppression.”  

Maulana Fazl says heads of component parties to meet on Dec 6 to ‘announce very important decisions’ 

Responding to a question, the Maulana rejected a perception that there was a deadlock among the parties on some matters and said they wanted to make decisions after thoroughly reviewing the possible outcomes of their moves while maintaining unity among the PDM component parties.  
When asked as to why the PDM had adopted a policy of duplicity as on one hand, it was not ready to hold reconciliation and, on the other, it was hesitating to launch a confrontational politics, the Maulana again briefly replied: “You will get the answer to this question also on December 6.”  
The journalists and political experts were expecting that the PDM, which had already met thrice over the last six weeks to discuss the issue, would this time come out with some solid plan as the meeting was taking place only a day after the opposition alliance’s steering committee announced that it had finalised its recommendations for the anti-government protest plan and these would be announced after the approval of the party heads in Tuesday’s meeting.  
Briefing the reporters about the decisions of the steering committee on Monday, PDM spokesman Hafiz Hamdullah had said they had proposed protest rallies, road caravans, sits-in and shutter-down and wheel-jam strikes over the next four months and a final long march towards Islamabad in upcoming March. He had claimed that the option of resignations from the legislatures was also under consideration.  
Mr Hamdullah also announced that the opposition had decided to challenge the recently passed controversial legislation, including the electoral reforms bill, in court and that they had also constituted a lawyers’ panel for the purpose.  
However, when the same question was put to Maulana Fazl on Tuesday, he was found non-committal, stating that they would go to courts but before that the judiciary needed to take steps to restore its confidence after the recent controversial affidavit of former chief judge of Gilgit-Baltistan Rana Shamim and the alleged leaked audio clip of former chief justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar.  
He said the controversial affidavit and leaked audio clip had “damaged” the judiciary’s image and now it was up to the judges to restore its image through their conduct. He regretted that the voices were coming from within the judiciary about the decisions taken against the democratically elected governments in the past.  
“It is up to the court to decide whether it is announcing verdicts after getting instructions [from some institutions] like Saqib Nisar or doing justice in line with the Constitution and laws,” he said.  
Maulana Fazl, who is also the chief of his own faction of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam, said the 33 bills passed by the government in a joint sitting of parliament on November 17 was a “mockery of parliamentary traditions”.  
Once again rejecting the idea of use of electronic voting machines (EVMs) in the next elections, he termed it a “pre-poll rigging plan”. He also said the opposition would come out with a strategy in line with the Constitution and laws to give true representation to overseas Pakistanis in parliament. He asked overseas Pakistanis “not to fall prey to the present illegitimate government which is a product of the rigged elections”.  
The Maulana lashed out at the government for bulldozing the EVM bill through parliament despite objections by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP). He also warned the government against taking any step to “make the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) a branch of the IMF (International Monetary Fund)”.  
This was the third meeting of the heads of PDM component parties in six weeks’ times, besides a number of meetings of its steering committee, after which the alliance leaders had announced deferment of its plan to launch what it always calls a decisive and final phase of the anti-government protest that would culminate on a long march towards Islamabad.  
After a similar meeting on Nov 6, the PDM had announced that it had decided to launch a “decisive” anti-government protest campaign, starting with a public meeting in Karachi on Nov 13 and culminating in a long march to Islamabad, the date of which would be finalised later.  
The announcement had been made by PDM secretary general and senior vice president of the PML-N Shahid Khaqan Abbasi in a statement issued after a meeting of the heads of component parties of the alliance held through video link.  
According to Mr Abbasi, the PDM leadership had decided to hold the last public meeting in Lahore. However, he did not announce any date for it, saying that after the Lahore’s public meeting, they would launch a “decisive long march” towards Islamabad.  
“This movement will come to an end only after sending [Prime Minister] Imran Khan home,” Mr Abbasi had said, adding that the people of Pakistan were not ready to tolerate the government even for a moment.  
The PDM had launched its first protest campaign in October last year with public meetings in major cities of the country and some of them were also addressed by self-exiled PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif through video link.  
Two other opposition parties — the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Awami National Party (ANP) — were also part of the PDM at that time.  
The first phase of the PDM’s movement came to an abrupt end as the alliance leadership did not announce any future programme after its last public meeting in Lahore on December 31.  
In March 2021, the PPP and ANP quit the alliance after developing differences over the issue of en masse resignations from parliament and controversial nomination of PPP’s Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani as leader of the opposition in the Senate.
