0,Senate body concerned over rising trend of crime in capital,"130 murder, 954 robbery, 585 theft and 47 rape cases so far reported this year, meeting told.","ISLAMABAD: Members of a parliamentary committee on Monday expressed grave concerns over the growing trend of crime in the federal capital.
The Senate Standing Committee on Interior met at Parliament House with Senator Mohsin Aziz in the chair.
The committee also took up the recent daylight robbery at the house of Senator Nuzhat Sadiq in F-10.
“This is not a katcha area rather the federal capital,” said Senator Saifullah Abro.

130 murder, 954 robbery, 585 theft and 47 rape cases so far reported this year, meeting told

Senator Fawzia Arshad said people had lost their trust in the police which was a “very very sad thing.” She said in a slum of F-7 many criminal activities had taken place but the police failed to stop them.
Briefing the committee, Senator Sadiq said a few days ago robbers looted her house after tying her husband and a guard and took away cash and gold ornaments.
“Since a number of robberies had already taken place in our surrounding streets, we were sure that anytime we would also be looted.” She said soon after the broad daylight robbery, her husband contacted Rescue 15 but its number was constantly busy and the staff did not bother to call back.
“I belonged to a blessed family, am not here for my case rather I want the life and property of the people of Islamabad protected,” she said.
According to data provided to the committee, during the last three years the crime rate has witnessed an upward trend in Islamabad. The data showed that in 2018 a total of 9,465 cases had been registered followed by 9,748 in 2019 and 10,539 last year.
When the committee members insisted on the current year’s crime figures, the SSP investigation said 130 people have been murdered and 954 robbery, 585 theft and 47 rape cases reported in the capital this year.
DIG Afzal Ahmed Kausar, however, told the committee that the police were now registering FIRs of almost all applicants that’s why there was an upward trend in crime.
Inspector General of Police Qazi Jamilur Rehman told the meeting that his force had been taking steps to ensure safety of people and their properties.
He said the police had traced many cases, including some high-profile cases. There are a number of criminal groups and police are trying to nab all of them. A theft case in G-13 was traced and recently in another case the police recovered Rs22 million from a snatcher within 24 hours, he added.

1,"PTI, PPP members support mayor in rare show of unity","RAWALPINDI: After restoration of the local government on the directives of the Supreme Court, the Rawalpindi...","RAWALPINDI: After restoration of the local government on the directives of the Supreme Court, the Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation (RMC) on Tuesday approved a tax-free budget worth Rs3.8 billion for six months of the fiscal year 2021-22 with an allocation of Rs2.75bn for development schemes.
With Aye vote, two PTI members supported the PML-N majority house and gave approval to the budget without any objection and said they would support PML-N and Rawalpindi Mayor Sardar Naseem Khan for development of the garrison city without any condition and oppose any move of the PTI-led government in Punjab to curtail the elected house’s power.
In a rare show of unity, PTI and PPP members said they would support Mayor Sardar Naseem Khan if he would move the Supreme Court to get the tenure of the elected house extended as two-and-a-half years were wasted by the Punjab government when it suspended the local governments in the province.
The budget session was held at Jinnah Hall of the RMC with Deputy Mayor Chaudhry Tariq in the chair. Mayor Sardar Naseem presented the budget.
The total outlay of the budget is Rs3.8 bn out of which about Rs2.7bn had been allocated for development while Rs1.9bn for non-development expenditures.
Speaking in the house, Mayor Sardar Naseem said the initial balance for the next six months of the current financial year was Rs2.4bn and expected revenue was Rs1.7bn.
“For salaries and pension, Rs515 million had been allocated, Rs296.5m set aside for office expenditures, Rs55m for necessary expenditures and Rs35m for pension liabilities,” he said.
He said Rs350m was fixed for ongoing development schemes, Rs7m for Punjab Municipal Services Programme (PMSP) uplift schemes, Rs75m was transferred to District Council accounts as some ongoing schemes in 24 union councils were given back to it and Rs46m of PMSP was also given to the District Council.
“For the development of Rawalpindi’s 46 union councils, Rs2.2bn had been allocated - Rs10m each allocated for street light maintenance and patch work of roads respectively, Rs15m for repair and maintenance of buildings,” he said.
The mayor got permission of the house to purchase three to four funeral buses and for maintenance of existing graveyards.
“All the local bodies of Punjab established under the Local Government Act 2013 were abolished in May 2019 before the end of their term. On the orders of the Supreme Court, the institutions were restored after two and a half years. And, we are back in our House today,” Mr Naseem said, adding that in future no one would dare dissolve these local governments before their term expired.
Speaking on the occasion, the elected chairmen from PTI said restoration of Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation after two-and-a-half years was a very good step of the Supreme Court.
PTI member Azhar Iqbal Satti from UC-27 said although there were only two elected chairmen from the PTI platform in the RMC, they would support Mayor Sardar Naseem without any condition to do work for residents of Rawalpindi. PPP member Anjum Farooq Paracha also assured Mayor Sardar Naseem of his support for the betterment of the city and to file petition in courts to extend the tenure of the present local governments.

In the symposium organised by the Youth Parliament Pakistan, “Why young people don’t vote in Pakistan?”, the participants discussed how young people were reluctant to participate in the electoral processes.
Bilal Gilani, Executive Director Gallup Pakistan, spoke on the youth turnout in the general elections and said one fourth of the youth normally cast their votes in Pakistan while the rest chose to stay away from the electoral process.
He said young women normally did not cast votes due to numerous factors such as their mobility constraints and household responsibilities.
He provided an overview of the statistical analysis of youth voter turnout in the past general elections. Mr Gilani said the current eligible youth had witnessed the downfall of the country’s economy and the peak of terrorist activities which had made them resilient but still sceptical about the electoral system.
The symposium was opened by Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, Pildat President. He shed light on the significance of youth voters in Pakistan.
Amna Kausar, projects manager Pildat and coordinator Youth Parliament Pakistan, gave an overview of the 17th Youth Parliament Pakistan which is in the process of receiving expressions of interest and selecting 300-900 young individuals belonging to 272 National Assembly constituencies, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan and overseas Pakistanis.
Nighat Siddique, Additional Director General Gender and Social Inclusion Wing, Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), spoke on young voters on electoral rolls and initiatives to improve the youth voter turnout.
She provided an overview of pilot projects to assess youth voter turnout in KP and how ECP was trying to extend it towards other universities.
She said the ECP was trying its best to reach out to the grassroots level community and to encourage their participation in the elections.
She also shed light on how the ECP had made the electoral process inclusive for people with disabilities, marginalised youth and women.
The age-wise data of voters recently released by the ECP showed that the proportion of voters below the age of 35 years was 45.84PC, placing them in a position where their active participation has the potential of tilting scales in favour of candidates of their choice in many constituencies.
Of the total 121 million voters, 55.57m are in the age bracket of 18 to 35 years whereas their number was slightly above 46m (43.82pc) in the 2018 elections.
Among these young voters (45.84pc), 31.98m or 26.38pc are in the age group of 26 to 35 years, while 23.58m or 19.46pc individuals are aged between 18 and 25 years.

“CDA is going to sign an agreement with the National Electronics Complex of Pakistan (NECOP) to retrofit the traditional sodium streetlights already installed in Islamabad to European standard LEDs lights,” says a statement issued by the civic authority.
It said these LED lights would be installed at 40pc of the cost of new LED lights. Under the agreement, conventional sodium streetlights that run at 250 watts will operate at 150 watts, while LED lights will have a 1,000-hour warranty.
“Yes we are going for LED light to save energy and finances,” CDA Chairman Amer Ali Ahmed said.
Speaking to Dawn, he said the CDA board, in its meeting to be held on Thursday, would also discuss this issue.
“We are planning to do this project in phases; in the first phase, 1,000 conventional streetlights will be converted,” he said, adding that later all streetlights would be retrofit.
The chairman said the CDA was also planning to introduce Global System of Mobiles (GSM) based monitoring and control system for streetlights for automatic switch on and off. Whereas, through computerised system, the civic agency will also detect fault of streetlights on the computer screen, he added.
Mr Ahmed said recently his team shifted 25 tubewells in Poona Faqiran area to an automated system for ensuring uninterrupted water supply for I-9 and I-10 sectors and the results were outstanding.
“We are now focusing on technology-based interventions,” he added.

This was highlighted by speakers during a two-day workshop organised to address climate challenges that the country is facing.
They added that climate change is disproportionately affecting the poorest people, young and old, women, indigenous communities and other marginalised groups,
Speaking as chief guest on the occasion, Dr Abdul Rahim Soomro, secretary Culture, Tourism and Antiquities Department (Sindh), said coastal climate vulnerability in Pakistan needs attention at the federal and provincial levels to broadly understand the issue and propose its inclusive solution.
He stressed the need for persistent action and coordinated efforts to ensure a resilient future for all.
“It is time we think of climate change as a development issue that has the potential to increase social differences and injustice, especially for those who are already living on the edge at the face of climate change,” he added.
Dr Tahir Rasheed, regional director of World Wildlife Fund (WWF-Pakistan), said climate change was causing biodiversity loss, habitat degradation and exacerbating freshwater issues in Pakistan.
“Community-based afforestation of mangroves has been initiated, under which over 100,000 mangrove saplings were planted in the Indus delta and Karachi coast. A total 90 female climate activists from local communities are actively working for plantation, post-care and monitoring activities along the Sindh coast. It is high time to formulate a strong network of experts and policy makers to support efforts to reverse climate change and enhance environmental protection across Sindh,” he added.
The workshop, which focused on providing a common platform to share information about select environmental issues along the coast of Pakistan and highlight efforts towards addressing those challenges, was organised by WWF-Pakistan and Oxfam GB to enhance formal coordinated efforts to address climate vulnerability. Both organisations have been working jointly over the past three years to enhance climate resilience of vulnerable coastal communities.
The project integrates a stakeholder inclusive implementation strategy and focuses on developing a strong research base, using the Vulnerability Risk Assessment, to determine the scale of vulnerability of natural resource dependent communities in Keti Bunder and Kharo Chan.
Participants learnt that the work carried out as part of this project, along with consultations and research has helped in drafting a local action plan of adaptation for these vulnerable coastal communities and in integrating it into polices and development budgets.

“We should consider AI as a tool for prosperity and not a replacement for human intelligence,” he said, adding that through the application of AI, information-intensive domains such as marketing, health care, financial services, education and professional services could become simultaneously more valuable and less expensive to society.

According to a notification, the committee is headed by Director Central Engineering Lab Nauman Sheikh and comprises Director Building Control (north) Nasir Jamil Butt and the head of treasury Khawaja Izzat Hasan.
On the direction of the chairman, the record of the school plot has been taken into custody by the security directorate while the one-window operation has been directed to stop any further transfer of the plot.
The finance wing of the CDA in May this year had calculated the price of the 11 kanals school plot for a private school in H-8 at the rate of Rs84,716 per square ,yard totaling Rs47.5 million. The CDA had later also issued an offer letter to the allottee, asking him to deposit Rs47.5 million.
While calculating the rate, the CDA did not opt for rates of commercial plots as normally commercial plots are sold at the rate of over Rs1.5 million per square yard.
However, the finance wing calculated the rate at Rs84,716 per square yard which is actually the rate for commercial oriented plots for government and semi-government. Under this rate, the CDA asked the allottee to deposit Rs47.5 million.
After a few months, the finance wing changed its earlier decision and decided to charge the allottee Rs23.75m at the rate of Rs42,358 per square yard and subsequently the estate wing issued an allotment letter with the reduced rate.
Member Estate Naveed Ilhai, who is the in-charge of the estate wing, issued a notification on Tuesday.
“The chairman has desired that record of property in question may be taken into custody by the security directorate and one window may be directed to stop any further transfer of property till the fact finding inquiry to ascertain and reconcile charges is completed,” read the notification.
The inquiry committee has been directed to furnish a report in five working days.

IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah warned that the court would summon the above mentioned authorities if they failed to implement the Police Order.
Justice Minallah was hearing a case related to the flawed police investigation. He asked Deputy Attorney General (DAG) Syed Mohammad Tayyab about the date when the police order was supposed to be implemented in Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT).
The court was told that the order was scheduled to be implemented on August 6, 2019. He, however, pointed out that the Local Government Act 2015 did not mention enforcement of the order.
Justice Minallah remarked that there was no need for mentioning the Police Order in the LG Act since both laws were not the same.
“The city managers cannot take this as an excuse since it prima facie shows that the police is not working in accordance with law,” the chief justice remarked, adding that the Police Order should have been enforced on August 6, 2015, when the local government was established in Islamabad.
The court directed the secretary interior, chief commissioner and IGP to constitute forums in accordance with the Police Order. Further hearing in the matter was adjourned till December 3.
