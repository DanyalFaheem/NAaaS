0,Qatar gets clearance to buy stake in LNG terminal in Pakistan,"Proposed transaction doesn’t meet presumption of market dominance, says CCP.","ISLAMABAD: The Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) on Tuesday cleared state-run Qatar Energy’s bid to acquire 49 per cent stakes in an upcoming private sector LNG terminal, paving the way for Qatar’s first direct investment in Pakistan’s energy market.
“The proposed transaction is hereby authorised,” said the country’s competition regulator in an order issued here saying the proposed transaction did not meet the presumption of dominance in the market because the target entity’s — Energas Terminal — share in the market would be no more than 33pc.

Proposed transaction doesn’t meet presumption of market dominance, says CCP

Energas, a merchant terminal yet to come on ground, is currently owned by three local business groups — Lucky, Sapphire and Halmore. Qasim Terminal Holding LLC (QTHL) is a subsidiary of Qatar Energy formerly known as Qatar Petroleum which has two long-term LNG supply contracts with state-run Pakistan State Oil (PSO).
The Qatari firm had filed a pre-merger application before the CCP for proposed acquisition of 49pc shareholding of Energas under section 11 of the Competition Act 2010 read with regulation 6 of Competition (Merger Control) Regulations 2016.
The CCP said it examined the documentation, the market situation and conducted an independent research of the terminal market that the ultimate acquirer – Qatar Energy – had business related to exploration, production and sale of crude oil, natural gas and gas liquids and refined products, fertiliser, investments in its local market and board including in bunkering and underwriting insurances and had entered into a subscription agreement with Energas for over Rs757 million to take over 49pc shareholding.
It noted that the there were overlaps between the merger entities but the acquisition would create a synergy for efficient development of LNG sector in Pakistan.
Energas is one of the two parties currently engaged with Pakistan government and its entities for development of additional LNG terminals on “merchant model” as against existing two terminals set up under government guarantees and processing fees.
Qatar is the largest producer and exporter of LNG and has been increasing its production and making further inroads in LNG export markets in recent months.
Last month, the Cabinet Committee on Energy (CCoE) approved allocation of pipeline capacity to two new LNG terminal developers — Energas and Tabeer Energy — to facilitate their investment in the additional gas infrastructure. 
Tabeer Energy is a subsidiary of Japan’s Mitsubishi Corporation.
While discussing a summary of the Ministry of Maritime Affairs on the report of the Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) on the establishment of new terminals, the CCoE “approved the allocation of pipeline capacity and directed to fast-track the work on setting up new LNG terminals”, according to an official announcement.
The meeting was informed that Petroleum Division and Sui gas companies continued to resist pipeline capacity to new terminal developers of the private sector – Energas and Tabeer Energy.
The report said the federal cabinet on Sept 8, 2020 “directed the Petroleum Division to allocate pipeline capacity in the existing and the new planned pipeline within 30 days”. The Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority also directed Sui companies to allocate 300-350mmcfd of pipeline capacity to the two terminal developers each in May this year. It said the Sui companies were “reluctant to allocate pipeline capacity”.
The report said there was 600mmcfd of gas pipeline capacity available for the new LNG terminal developers and the regulator also confirmed the same situation. It said SNGPL had total pipeline capacity of 1200mmcfd and long term contract of 1,000mmcfd till 2024 while 150mmcfd gas was shifted to K-Electric and 250mmcfd to SSGC — leaving spare capacity of 600mmcfd.
The summary noted that Sui companies were averse to deregulate the gas market despite losing substantial gas quantities to pilferage and adding to circular debt of billions of rupees. The summary advocated deregulating the gas sector like aviation, telecom and banking sectors to reduce burden on exchequer and save taxpayers money.

1,46 killed in bus crash on Bulgaria highway,"North Macedonia declares three days of mourning, Bulgaria declares one.","BOSNEK: North Macedonia called for three days of national mourning after a tourist bus carrying its citizens caught fire and crashed in Bulgaria on Tuesday, killing 46 people in Europe’s deadliest road accident in the past decade.
Although the cause has yet to be determined, officials believe the bus crashed into the guardrails and caught fire while returning from Istanbul in Turkey to Skopje in North Macedonia.
Those who died trapped in the burning bus — including four-year-old twins, according to media reports — were mostly from North Macedonia, prompting the government to declare three days of mourning.
The flag of the Republic of North Macedonia will be flown at half-mast.
Bulgaria has also declared a day of mourning on Wednesday.
Only four men and three women, including a 16-year-old girl, survived the crash by breaking one of the windows and jumping to safety, according to officials.
“I lost my whole family in the blaze,” one man told the Sloboden Pecat newspaper, saying 10 relatives had died.
Media in North Macedonia reported that several of the dead were from a Skopje primary school, where all classes were stopped.
The accident happened after midnight on a highway about 40km from Sofia, near the village of Bosnek.
Many of the dead were between 20 to 30 years old, officials said.
Local media said the bus was registered with the Besa Trans tourist agency, which organises sightseeing and shopping tours to Istanbul.
It was one of four buses travelling back to Skopje along the same highway at short intervals.
The tour bus company did not immediately respond when contacted by AFP for comment.
Images showed the carcass of the charred bus after it broke through the highway’s central guardrail.
Bulgaria’s interim Prime Minister Stefan Yanev said a probe into the accident had been launched, dismissing suggestions that road conditions were to blame.
Deputy chief prosecutor Borislav Sarafov said they were still investigating “if it was a technical fault of the vehicle or a human error that caused the crash”.
North Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev told state news agency MIA that he had spoken to one survivor. “He explained that they were sleeping in the bus when an explosion was heard. They succeeded in breaking one of the windows and saved a few people.”

2,SC refuses to hear appeals in plot case before IHC ruling,Apex court judge says present case has become infructuous after a division bench of the IHC reserved its decision on Monday.,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court has decided to wait for a ruling by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) before hearing appeals against a restraining order given by the latter against the allotment of prized plots in the federal capital’s posh sectors.
On Tuesday, the apex court disposed of a challenge to the Aug 20 IHC order by the Federal Government Employees Housing Authority (FGEHA) after it was told that the high court had sought written replies from the parties concerned.
“We don’t consider it appropriate to proceed further on a matter in which the petitioners have assailed the interim order of the high court as the ruling has been reserved and will be announced soon,” observed a three-judge bench, headed by Justice Umar Ata Bandial.
“It is relevant to understand how a challenge to an interim order would be maintainable when the pending matter has been reserved for announcement of the judgement,” the bench observed.
On Monday a division bench of the IHC had reserved its decision on a ballot held by the FGEHA in August for allotment of plots in Islamabad’s F-14 and F-15 sectors.  The court was hearing identical petitions filed against the ballot questioning the allotment of 4,723 plots to top judges and bureaucrats.
Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, a member of the Supreme Court bench, suggested to Munir Paracha, an advocate for FGEHA, that his client should have gone to the Islamabad High Court to challenge its order of suspending the allotment of plots. But since the IHC had reserved its ruling, the present case had become infructous, the judge added.
Justice Shah observed that the petitioner should have raised his objection against the IHC’s move to exercise suo motu jurisdiction in the matter before the high court itself.
Justice Bandial told the petitioners that they could  challenge the allotments either through an intra-court appeal before the high court or before the apex court after the IHC delivered its judgement.
In its order the Supreme Court said the petitioners had raised a plea that the Aug 20 IHC interim order had gone beyond the controversy raised before it and in doing so,  the high court exercised suo motu jurisdiction to touch upon matters extraneous to the case. 
The petitioners had argued the IHC lacked the authority to exercise suo motu powers. In its petition, the FGEHA pleaded with the apex court to set aside the Aug 20 IHC order of suspending the allotments made in favour of judicial officers who were serving, or had served, in the high court and the Islamabad District Courts.
The IHC had not only fixed the matter before a larger bench for further hearing, but also expressed its surprise that in the ballot for allotment of plots in F-14 and F-15 sectors, virtually every judicial officer of the capital’s District Courts was a beneficiary. This creates doubts because these individuals were expected to adjudicate upon petitions brought before them by the affected land owners, the court said.
The high court held that the matter involved a conflict of interest because the plots were given at prices that were substantially lower than the current market rates. Thus each beneficiary has a financial interest. 
Moreover, the bench noted, the list included even those judicial officers who were dismissed on account of misconduct or corruption.
The appeal recalled that the petitioners before the high court had not challenged acquisition of the land.
The high court had raised questions through its Aug 20 order which were neither taken up by the petitioners nor any prayer to that effect was made in the writ petition, the appeal argued.
“This amounts to exercise of suo motu power which the high court does not have. The high court can invoke the writ jurisdiction under Article 199 either on the application of an aggrieved party or on the application of any person. The Aug 20 order is patently illegal,” the appeal highlighted. The FGEHA, it contended, was a public institution working for providing shelter to federal government employees and retirees, but it had been scandalised in the media by vested interests.

4,Lira collapse leaves Turks bewildered,Former prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu describes President Erdogan's economic measures as “treason and not ignorance”.,"ANKARA: Anxious Turks struggled to keep up with a bewildering collapse in their currency and the main opposition party leader said the country was experiencing its darkest “catastrophe” as the lira slumped 15 per cent on Tuesday against the dollar. 
Tuesday’s meltdown follows weeks of steep falls in the lira which have already driven up prices, leaving ordinary Turks reconsidering everything from their holiday plans to weekly grocery shopping. 
“There has not been such a catastrophe in the history of the Republic,” said Kemal Kilicdaroglu, leader of the opposition Republican People’s Party, blaming the currency freefall on President Tayyip Erdogan who has led the country since 2003. “At this point, you are a fundamental national security problem for the Republic of Turkey,” Kilicdaroglu said. Erdogan has pressured the central bank to slash interest rates in a move he says will boost exports, investment and jobs, but which critics say will further fuel double-digit inflation and erode the lira, cutting deeply into Turks’ earnings. 
Shoppers at a central Ankara mall said they could not take their eyes off the lira rate, which plunged as far as 13.45 to the dollar on Tuesday. A year ago it was 8 to the dollar, last month it reached 9 and last week it hit 10. 
“I’ve become unable to work without following the dollar,” said 28-year-old advertising agency worker Selin. “I don’t think there is a single day where I don’t have to watch my budget, and the calculation changes 100 times by the time I get next month’s salary. There is nothing left, including toilet paper, that I buy without thinking carefully.” 
Former prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu, a founding member of Erdogan’s ruling AK Party before breaking away to form his own party, described the president’s economic measures as “treason and not ignorance”. 
Kilicdaroglu, Davutoglu and some other opposition leaders have announced emergency meetings to discuss the currency after Tuesday’s crash — the lira’s second biggest fall ever.

5,Medal for Indian pilot aimed at hiding embarrassment: FO,Says granting military honours for imaginary feats of gallantry is contrary to norms of military conduct,"ISLAMABAD: Foreign Office said on Tuesday that award of a gallantry medal to Indian Air Force (IAF) pilot Abhinandan Varthaman was an attempt by Delhi to hide the embarrassment suffered in February 2019 through a fictitious story of downing a Pakistani F-16.
“The citation of the award to the downed Indian pilot is a classic case of Indian fabrications and pure fantasy to appease domestic audience and hide the embarrassment,” FO said in its reaction a day after pilot of downed IAF aircraft Abhinandan was given India’s third-highest gallantry medal Vir Chakra by President Ram Nath Kovind.
Wing Commander Abhinandan, who has now been promoted to the rank of group captain, was captured by Pakistani forces on Feb 27, 2019 after his MiG 21 Bison aircraft was shot down by Pakistan Air Force (PAF). He was days later returned to India as a “goodwill gesture”.
According to the award citation: “Wing Commander Varthaman Abhinandan then pursued a retreating enemy fighter bomber aircraft, and in the ensuing aerial combat, shot down an F-16 aircraft.”

Says granting military honours for imaginary feats of gallantry is contrary to norms of military conduct 

While challenging the Indian claim of shooting down an F-16 aircraft, FO recalled that the United States and other foreign experts had after checking PAF’s F-16 inventory confirmed that none of the Pakistani aircraft was lost on that day.
“India’s insistence on propagating a lie that has been thoroughly exposed is ludicrous and nonsensical. Granting military honours for imaginary feats of gallantry is contrary to every norm of military conduct. By giving such award, also as an afterthought, India has only made a mockery of itself,” FO maintained.
Recalling the events of the day, it said two Indian aircraft were shot down by PAF on Feb 27, 2019 in “in a daring day light action.” One of the Indian Mig-21 Bison aircraft fell down in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, while an IAF SU 30 fell on the other side of Line of Control. The pilot of the aircraft that fell on the Pakistani side ejected, was captured by armed forces and later returned to India as “a goodwill gesture”.
India had claimed that Abhinandan’s release was result of its pressure.
“Despite being captured by the enemy, he continued to display exceptional resolve in dealing with the adversary in a stoic, brave and dignified manner till he was repatriated on Mar 1, 2019,” the citation further read.
FO said Abhinandan’s return to India was testimony of Pakistan’s desire for peace despite India’s hostility and ill-conceived aggressive action.
Recalling the chaos in Indian armed forces following the downing of two of their fighter jets, FO said Indian military had in “panic” on that day shot down its own MI 17 helicopter near Srinagar. The incident was initially denied, but subsequently accepted.
“Indian Air Force was completely outplayed on the day,” FO underscored.
“It is obvious that India’s farcical story has no credibility whatsoever before the international community,” it further said.
Pakistan’s readiness and resolve to thwart any hostile designs, FO noted, remains as it was in Feb 2019. Cautioning New Delhi against any future misadventure, it asked India to learn from its botched attempt to violate Pakistan’s sovereignty.
