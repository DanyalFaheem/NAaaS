Earlier, two OPDs of paeds and gynae had been made functional by the administration last month.  
Medical Superintendent Dr Maqbool Ahmed told Dawn that in view of the growing number of patients and sharing the burden of the Bahawal Victoria Hospital (BVH), the OPDs of ENT, medicine, eye, skin and psychiatry of Nawab Sadiq Hospital had been made operational. However, the MS added, the admission of the indoor patients to the seven departments would not be resumed as the hospital wards were closed and reserved for the patients suffering from Covid-19 and dengue fever. 
The dengue ward was shifted from the BVH to Nawab Sadiq Hospital last month. According to MS, the OPDs of six departments were yet to be made operational.  
Nawab Sadiq Hospital, formerly Government Civil Hospital, had been declared Covid-19 hospital where all other departments had been closed and shifted to BVH. However, Principal Prof Dr Maqsood Niaz of Quaid-e-Azam Medical College (QAMC) was hopeful that the remaining OPDs also would be made operational.  
STRIKE: The owners of the petrol filling stations have announced that they will provide petrol and diesel only to the vehicles of Rescue 1122 and other ambulances across the division from Thursday (tomorrow).  
Association divisional president Muhammad Yaseen demanded that their commission should be enhanced to six per cent to which the government had agreed last month. As the government had failed to meet the Nov 17 deadline, he said, the petroleum dealers would proceed on complete strike from Nov 25 for an indefinite period.

5,Cancellation of autonomy to 18 colleges: HED moves summary to Punjab CM for approval,Punjab Professors and Lecturers Association has been consistently protesting against the autonomy of the 18 colleges.,"SAHIWAL: The Punjab Higher Education Department (HED), in consultation with the provincial finance and law departments, has reportedly moved a summary to Chief Minister Usman Buzdar, demanding ‘rescinding/cancellation’ of the autonomous status of 18 public sector colleges to non-autonomous status, Dawn learnt from sources.  
The Punjab Professors and Lecturers Association (PPLA) has been consistently protesting against the autonomy to the 18 colleges.  
Sources added that the HED had proposed to the CM to advise the governor to cancel the Aug 8, 2010 notification that had granted autonomous status to 18 colleges under Sub-Section 2 (1) Clause (C)-2 of The Punjab Government Educational and Training Institutions Ordinance 1960, amended in 1984 & 2002.  
It is said Naeem Ghaus, special secretary HED, confirmed the denotification summary regarding administrative and financial autonomy of 18 colleges had been moved. Mr Ghaus assured the PPLA leaders that autonomous status of college would be withdrawn within weeks.  
It is important to note that two PML-N parliamentarians from Sahiwal district, Malik Arshad and Naveed Aslam Lodhi, had submitted two separate adjournment motions in the Punjab Assembly while Malik Nadeem Kamran, former provincial Minister for Planning and Development, had asked Minister for Higher Education Raja Yassir Humayun for withdrawal of autonomous status to 18 colleges.  
In 2010, the HED, under an ordinance, had declared 26 colleges as autonomous and recommended formation of the board of governors (BoGs) for financial and administrative autonomy.  
The HED move was strongly rejected by then PPLA through protests. Some college teachers while filing different petitions had challenged formation of BoGs before the Lahore High Court. 
The LHC bench, under Justice Ijazul Hasan and Justice Shaukat Ali Khan, had reportedly suspended HED notification of 2010 by declaring that ordinance ‘lapsed’ as it was not implemented for three years. But even after getting instruction from the court, the HED did not withdraw notification.  
It is worth mentioning that no BoGs were formed in 18 colleges since 2012.  
PPLA Secretary-General Sahibzada Ahmed Nadeem told Dawn it was result of the protests by the college teachers that the HED had decided to move back on BoGs, which had been dysfunctional since 2012. 
Cylinder blast: A 15-year-old worker was critically injured when a cylinder burst at a tyre shop on Arifwala Road on Tuesday.

In another incident, a woman was hit and killed by a fast-moving car while she was crossing the Arifwala Road near Chak 100/9-L.  
The woman was later identified as Ameeran Bibi, a resident of the abovementioned village. Police arrested the car driver.

The house took up a resolution of PML-N MPA Raheela Khadim Hussain, though it was not even on the agenda for the day, which called for increasing allowances arguing that the prevailing price hike had disturbed the households of all the lawmakers.
Speaker Chaudhry Parvez Elahi endorsed the demand saying even the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) had increased its fare three to four times. He directed Law Minister Raja Basharat to immediately talk to the finance department for increasing allowances of the MPAs.  
The resolution was unanimously adopted by the house as none from the treasury or opposition benches opposed it.  
The house adopted another resolution related to the reported closure of Rawalpindi Gymkhana and converting the place into an IT tower.  
The speaker decided to further take up the matter by referring it to the house committee being chaired by himself and directed the law minister to ensure that the Rawalpindi commissioner appeared before the panel when summoned.  
Raja Basharat said the government had no role in the decision on the Gymkhana.  
PML-N’s Tahir Khalil Sindhu complained that Chenab Club, Faisalabad, sent bogus letters of permanent membership of the club to the legislators belonging to the textile city.  
Provincial minister Chaudhry Zaheeruddin who also belongs to Faisalabad clarified that only those members were given permanent status who were associated with the club for the last eight years.  
Mr Sindhu challenged the criteria for granting Chenab Club membership, arguing if a grade-17 government officer could become its member any time then why not an MPA who, he said, is equal to a grade-22 officer.  
Speaker Parvez Elahi directed the law minister to get the issue resolved, recalling that the matter had earlier cropped up when he (Mr Elahi) was the chief minister and it had been settled there and then.
Meanwhile, the Punjab Institute of Quran and Seerat Studies (amendment) Bill 2021, and the National College of Business Administration & Economics (amendment) Bill 2021 were tabled in the house as the chair referred them to the relevant committees with the direction to present their reports on the same within two months.

10,Lahore sees ‘sharp’ surge in dengue cases,Public health experts attribute the recent surge to ‘inadequate’ remedial strategies.,"LAHORE: The health authorities seem helpless to contain dengue fever as the city witnesses a three-fold increase in the number of confirmed cases during the last two weeks or so.
The increase is believed to be due to rapid growth of the dengue mosquitoes in several localities of the provincial capital where complaints against health authorities increased for not carrying out anti-vector activities.  
Some public health experts have attributed the recent surge to ‘inadequate’ remedial strategies.  
They are of the view that the dengue fever spreads by several species of female mosquito - Aedes aegypti - and the epidemic can only be contained by taking preventive measures and creating awareness.  
They says the health authorities are focusing more on the curative side instead of taking steps to control growth of the dengue mosquito.  
Many family physicians practicing in streets and towns claim that the dengue epidemic has worsened during the last two weeks or so and most of the confirmed cases (around 60 per cent) are going unreported officially.
“In the past two weeks the number of patients with complaints of dengue fever has increased three times than reported a month back”, family physician Dr Arif from Samanabad told this reporter. 
Also read: 19,595 dengue patients in Punjab so far, court told 
“I was attending seven to nine patients with history of dengue symptoms since the disease hit Punjab. This number has increased to around 20 during the last two weeks,” he said.  
University of Health Sciences Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Javed Akram says simple dengue fever cases are on the decline but the patients with complications of second and third form of the virus are increasing.  
“We are dealing [these days] most of the patients suffering from type 2 of the dengue fever,” he says adding that other cases are also being reported but in less number.
“Lahore is at a high risk because of many overcrowded localities, unsafe drinking water and inadequate sanitation,” Prof Akram says.A senior public health official says the Institute of Public Health, the directorate of health services Punjab and other institutions were set up for research on preventive health.
He says these institutes are not being utilised properly for checking epidemics of infections like dengue.
He says the public sector teaching hospitals of Lahore are facing a tremendous pressure of dengue patients. The hospitals have no space to accommodate a large number of patients, forcing the health facilities to convert other wards into ‘dengue wards’ in order to adjust most of them.
The Lahore General Hospital has stopped admission of patients for eyes treatment for a brief period and shifted the dengue fever patients there.
Contrary to the above-mentioned reports, the Punjab health department has claimed a decline in the number of dengue cases across the province, including Lahore.
According to the official data released by health department on Tuesday, four patients died of the virus in Punjab during the last 24 hours, taking the toll to 126 since January so far.
Similarly, the number of infections in Punjab reached 23,866 after 139 more people tested positive for dengue. Of them, 106 were reported from Lahore.

During his appearance in a smog-related matter, the mayor told the court that the Metropolitan Corporation of Lahore (MCL) had already started work with the coordination of traffic police and focal persons for removal of encroachments on the roads in the metropolitan area.  
However, he complained about the shortage of funds for carrying out work related to road alignment, traffic management and removal of encroachments.  
Advocate Sheraz Zaka, a counsel for one of the petitioners, argued that had there been effectiveness of the local government institutions, the issue of smog and air pollution would have been dealt with efficiently.  
Justice Shahid Karim observed that the role of local governments could not be neglected keeping in view Article 140A of the Constitution. He said an appropriate direction could be issued if the mayor filed an application before the court regarding the non-release of funds.  
The mayor also submitted the record of anti-encroachment activities undertaken by the MCL.  
The judge commended the activities, however, observed that they ought to be pursued vigorously without any discrimination or favouritism towards any particular group or person.  
The judge also directed the LDA to undertake extensive and broad operations against encroachments in the city.
Justice Karim observed that the vendors having temporary carts and other means of selling their goods could be provided a permanent place on a rental basis so that they may not disperse all over the areas in Lahore.  
The judge directed the government to ensure compliance of its notification regarding closure of schools and offices, working in Lahore, for three days in a week. He directed the sessions judge of Lahore to ensure appointment of full-time magistrates for their disposal with the LDA and MCL to deal with the encroachments in their respective jurisdictions.

“Prime Minister Imran Khan intends to take the price of per liter petrol to Rs200. The step will be disastrous,” PML-N Punjab information secretary Azma Bokhari said while talking to the reporters outside the Punjab Assembly on Tuesday.  
She said the government was reluctant to make the IMF deal public because the fund had dictated its own terms under which per litre petrol’s price would shoot up. She said loan was called a package and a good omen for the country in the ‘New Pakistan’ of Imran Khan. 
Ms Bokhari said Chief Minister Usman Buzdar should be taken to task for his administration’s utter failure in controlling smog in the province, especially Lahore. She said Buzdar might copy Shehbaz Sharif but could not become like him because for that he would need to work day and night.  
The PML-N lawmaker said Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz were convicted in fake cases to bring Imran Khan to power. She asked former chief justice Saqib Nisar not to run away after his video was leaked in which had confessed that Nawaz and Maryam were to be convicted to make way for Imran Khan.   
“Why Saqib Nisar does not sue Ahmed Noorani if the video is fake?” Ms Bokhari asked and added that the former CJ had been exposed and he would be held accountable for his deeds.

In a statement issued on Tuesday, he said these elements cannot resign or hold a long march, adding that the parties in this unnatural alliance were only deceiving each other.
The PDM has become a gathering of elements involved in corruption but the nation has fully recognized the faces of those who have mercilessly looted the country, he said.
He said Maulana Fazlur Rehman and Shehbaz Sharif are obsolete pawns. The opposition has neither any narrative nor strategy. 
The corrupts in the PDM want to obstruct the development of Pakistan to cover up their nefarious acts of corruption, said the SACM. 
They want to fulfil their nefarious designs by mocking the institutions but their conspiracy against the institutions will never succeed, concluded the SACM.

19,"Immovable property as surety bond not required for bail, judges told",MULTAN: District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Akmal Khan directed all of the judges working under his supervision ...,"MULTAN: District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Akmal Khan directed all of the judges working under his supervision that no bail petition should be adjourned on account of non-production of record while no bond was required as a proof of ownership of immovable asset for court surety. 
In his guidelines, through his order to all the judicial officers posted in the district, copies of which were also forwarded to all the bar associations of the district, the judge stated that disposal of the bail petitions, particularly the post-arrest bail petitions, kept on lingering due to non-production of the record or non-service of the complainant. 
“It is also unfortunate to note that submission of bail bonds made a gigantic, insurmountable and expensive task for the litigants even in cases if the petty nature and first offenders. There are numerous complaints in respect of bribing the court staff for acceptance of bail bonds and encouraging and using the tout mafia for submission of fake bail bonds. Numerous irregularities regarding verification and entry of the bail bonds have also been noticed. It is also pathetic to note that this important task has been assigned by the presiding officers to the court staff which, in most of the cases, has provided them the opportunity to grease their palms from the litigant public,” he stated. 
Mr Khan directed that the court should get its order of production of record complied with, without fail, and in case the court seized with the bail petition was unable and felt handicapped to procure the record, the focal person of the Multan city police officer would immediately be informed in early hours of the day and, if needed, the matter would be brought into his notice by the judge concerned. 
Terming the non-service of the complainant in connection with the bail petition another hurdle in the timely disposal of the petition, Mr Khan directed that besides issuing notices to the complainant, the Naib Court/Ahlmad would make a phone call to the complainant whose cell number was available in the FIR itself while he would also put a note on the margin of the order sheet while the court concerned would ensure issuance of notice and service of the complainant and would not adjourn the case. 
The judged directed that no bail bond would be required to be accompanied by a proof of immovable asset of a surety, e.g. registered sale deed, fard Jamabandi etc. 
“The court, while granting a bail, shall specifically mention in the order that the bail bond need not be accompanied by any such proof. Preference shall be given to the close relative of an accused to become surety by mentioning his moveable asset in the bail bonds and the court staff and the learned presiding officer concerned shall ensure the same. No court staff, in absence of specific written direction, from the court shall insist upon the bail bonds to be accompanied by proof of ownership of immovable asset of a surety. In case some unscrupulous element/tout is accepted as surety, the staff of the court concerned shall be responsible for it and shall also be proceeded against under the law,” he stated.

They also staged a protest demonstration against the government for not ensuring supply of urea and DAP fertiliser for them and allowing the hoarders to sell it at exorbitant prices. The driver reportedly told the farmers that he was on way from Sadiqabad to Faisalabad to provide supply of the fertiliser when traders forcibly tried to unload the bags.  
The growers told reporters that they were perturbed by the shortage of the fertiliser and its high prices. They said the government had completely failed to bridle the hoarders and the profiteers who were fleecing the farmers with impunity. 
They said they were reading reports in the media that crackdown on profiteers and fertiliser hoarders was under way but the situation seemed otherwise. Why would they stop the trailer carrying the fertiliser bags if the commodity was available in the market, they argued. They said they urgently needed the fertiliser for wheat and its shortage could land the farmers and the masses in trouble in the days to come. 
A police team pacified the farmers and helped the trailer go to its destination. 
A district administration official said the government was conducting raids on a daily basis and had seized thousands of bags stored in warehouses, sealed the stores and also imposed fines on the traders. He said political elements could be behind this protest as stopping a trailer was a crime and not a solution to the issue.
