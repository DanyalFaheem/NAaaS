0,US challenges Opec+ with coordinated release of oil from reserves,Officials say it is the first time that the US has coordinated such a move with some of the world’s largest oil consumers.,"WASHINGTON: The United States said on Tuesday it will release millions of barrels of oil from strategic reserves in coordination with China, India, South Korea, Japan and Britain, to try to cool prices after Opec+ producers repeatedly ignored calls for more crude.
US President Joe Biden, facing low approval ratings amid rising inflation ahead of next year’s congressional elections, has grown frustrated at repeatedly asking the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as Opec+, to pump more oil without getting any response.
Crude oil prices recently touched seven-year highs and although they are still some way short of levels reached between 2011 and 2014, when they broke through $100 a barrel, many consumers are feeling the pain of a dramatic increase from a year ago.

The US announcement was for a release of 50 million barrels, the equivalent of about two and a half days of US demand. India, meanwhile, said it would release 5 million barrels, while Britain said it would allow the voluntary release of 1.5 million barrels of oil from privately held reserves.
Details on the amount and timing of the release of oil from South Korea, Japan and China were not announced. Seoul said it would decide after discussions with the United States and other allies. And Japanese media said Tokyo would detail its plans on Wednesday.
Officials said it was the first time that the United States had coordinated such a move with some of the world’s largest oil consumers.
Opec+, which includes Saudi Arabia and other US allies in the Gulf, as well as Russia, has rebuffed requests to pump more at its monthly meetings. It meets again on Dec 2 to discuss policy but has so far shown no indication it will change tack.
The group has been struggling to meet existing targets under its agreement to gradually increase production by 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) each month — a pace Washington sees as too slow — and it remains worried that a resurgence of coronavirus cases could once again drive down demand.
Recent high oil prices have been caused by a sharp rebound in global demand, which cratered early in the pandemic in 2021, and analysts have said that releasing reserves may not be enough to curb further rises.
“Its not large enough to bring down prices in a meaningful way and may even backfire if it prompts Opec+ to slow the pace at which it is raising output,” said Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist at Capital Economics Ltd.
Benchmark Brent crude was trading above $80 a barrel on Tuesday, up from its levels before the announcement but still well below last month’s three-year high of more than $86.
The release from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve would be a combination of a loan and a sale to companies, US officials said. The 32 million barrels loan will take place over the next several months, while the administration would accelerate a sale of 18 million barrels already approved by Congress to raise funds for the budget.
“We will continue talking to international partners on this issue. The president stands ready to take additional action if needed, and is prepared to use his full authorities working in coordination with the rest of the world,” a senior US administration official told reporters.
An Opec+ source and several market analysts said the release was not as big as the headline figure suggested.

1,UK apologises over Gulf  War ‘human shields’ flight,Former hostages have long sought answers about what the government in London knew about the incident.,"LONDON: The UK government on Tuesday apologised for not warning British Airways that Iraq was about to invade Kuwait before one of its flights was caught up in a hostage drama in 1990.
Passengers on BA flight 149 were taken off the Kuala Lumpur-bound plane when it landed in the Gulf state on August 2 that year, hours after Saddam Hussein’s troops swept in.
Some of the 367 passengers and crew spent more than four months in captivity, including as human shields at the hands of the Iraqi dictator.
The former hostages have long sought answers about what the government in London knew and when, as well as whether special forces were on the flight, putting them at risk.
Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told parliament that the UK ambassador to Kuwait informed London about reports of an Iraqi incursion at about midnight on August 2, 1990.
BA 149 was already in the air when the message was passed to departments including the foreign and defence ministries, Downing Street and the MI6 intelligence service.
But it was not circulated to BA, Truss said in a written answer, as she released files on the events to Britain’s national archives.
“The call made (by the ambassador) has never been publicly disclosed or acknowledged until today,” she added.
“These files show that the existence of the call was not revealed to parliament and the public. This failure was unacceptable.
“As the current secretary of state, I apologise to the House for this, and I express my deepest sympathy to those who were detained and mistreated.” BA 149 was late taking off, officially for  “technical problems”, and landed in Kuwait City at 0113 GMT. About 45 minutes later the city’s airport was closed.
Truss said the files indicated that the ambassador was uncertain about the scale of the Iraqi incursion, and no procedure existed at the time to warn airlines or at-risk flights.
She also reaffirmed the government’s previously stated position that UK special forces were not on board and  “did not attempt in any way to exploit the flight”.
BA has always denied accusations of negligence, conspiracy and a cover-up.
“These records confirm British Airways was not warned about the invasion,” the company said on Tuesday.
But one of the passengers, Barry Manners, said he did not accept the apology and rejected the assertion that no special forces were on the flight.
“Who on earth were they then? Members of a rugby team?” he added.  “These were serious guys, you only had to look at them... I know they were soldiers.” A book published earlier this year,  “Operation Trojan Horse”, claims London knowingly put passengers at risk by using the flight to deploy undercover operatives and delayed take-off to allow them to board.

2,US calls for infusing liquidity into Afghan banking system without benefiting Taliban,State Department Spokesperson Ned Price says US has pledged $474m of humanitarian assistance to Afghans this year alone.,"WASHINGTON: Hours after the United Nations sought international intervention to prevent a possible collapse of Afghanistan’s banks, the United States promised on Tuesday to look for options to ‘infuse liquidity’ into the system without enriching the Taliban.
On Monday, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) released a new situation report on Afghanistan, saying that the country’s financial and bank payment systems were ‘in disarray.’
The report details the state of the banking and financial system prior to the political transition on 15 August 2021, as well as the current situation in the three months since.
“Prompt and decisive action is urgently needed, with delays in decision-making expected to increase the cost of a banking system collapse – a grim predicament,” the report warns.
“We are working very closely with the UN … to find ways to offer liquidity to infuse,” said US State Department Spokesperson Ned Price when asked at a news briefing if the US was willing to help prevent the predicted collapse.
The United States, he said, was also working with other countries, “and bilaterally and multilaterally as well, to see to it that the people of Afghanistan can take advantage of international support in ways that don’t flow into the coffers of the Taliban.”
Mr Price pointed out that the US has pledged $474 million of humanitarian assistance to the people of Afghanistan this year alone, adding: “We know that the Afghan economy, even before the fall of the previous government, was in dire need of international support.”
Underlining the need to continue providing humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan, Mr. Price said: “We believe that we can … support the humanitarian needs of the people of Afghanistan even as we continue to make clear to the Taliban the expectations that we have of them when it comes to the priority issues that we’ve laid out.”
The United States, he said, wanted Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers to ensure free passage for all, fulfill their counterterrorism commitments, protect human rights and form an inclusive government before establishing any ties with them.
The UNDP report on Afghanistan describes a banking system at a near-standstill, with humanitarian interventions thwarted by the country’s liquidity crisis, deepened by a lack of confidence on the part of depositors and international markets. IMF projections cited in the report predict a contraction of up to 30 per cent in the Afghan economy for 2021-2022.
Total banking system deposits fell from 268 billion AFN (US$2.9 billion) at the end of 2020 to 194 billion (US$2 billion) in September of this year. Those may fall to 165 billion AFN (US$1.8 billion) by the end of 2021, a loss of approximately 40 percent.

3,"Poor diet imperilling humans and planet, says report","Says at current rates, the world will fail to meet eight out of nine nutrition targets set by the WHO for 2025.","PARIS: Nearly half the world’s population suffer from poor nutrition linked to too much or not enough food, a global assessment said on Tuesday with wide-ranging impacts on health and the planet.
The Global Nutrition Report (GNR), a yearly survey and analysis of the latest data on nutrition and related health issues, found that 48 percent of people currently eat either too little or too much — resulting in them being overweight, obese or underweight.
At current rates, the report finds, the world will fail to meet eight out of nine nutrition targets set by the World Health Organisation for 2025.
These include reducing child wasting (when children are too thin for their height) and child stunting (when they are too short for their age), and also adult obesity.
The report estimates nearly 150 million children under five years old are stunted, more than 45 million are wasted and nearly 40 million are overweight.
It also finds more than 40 percent of adults (2.2 billion people) are now overweight or obese.
“Avoidable deaths due to poor diets have grown by 15 percent since 2010 and poor diets are now responsible for a quarter of all adult deaths,” Chair of the GNR’s Independent Expert Group Renata Micha said.
“Our global findings show that our diets have not improved over the last ten years and are now a major threat to people’s health and to the planet.”
Foods matter
This year’s GNR is the first to look at global diets and how food choices are affecting people and the planet.
It finds people are failing to consume enough health-promoting foods like fruits and vegetables, particularly in lower-income countries.
Higher-income countries had the highest intake of foods with harmful health impacts like red meat, dairy and sugary drinks.
Consumption of harmful foods is on the rise, the report found, with red and processed meat already at almost five times the maximum recommendation of one serving a week.
The report notes that current global nutrition targets do not mention diet, with the exception of limiting sodium, and recommends new, more holistic targets.
“The science supports a food-based approach or diet-pattern approach in assessing the impacts on health and the environment,” Micha said.
In line with other estimates, the GNR calculated global food demand generated some 35 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in 2018.
“Animal-source foods have generally higher environmental footprints per product than plant-based foods,” the report said.
“Consequently, they were responsible for the majority of food-related greenhouse gas emissions and land use, with particularly large impacts from beef, lamb and dairy.” The report called for urgent funding to improve nutrition across the globe, particularly as Covid-19 has pushed an estimated additional 155 million people into extreme poverty. The GNR estimates the nutrition spending will need to increase by nearly $4 billion annually until 2030 to meet stunting, wasting, maternal anaemia and breastfeeding targets alone.

4,Former prime ministers pay tribute to British lawmaker at funeral,"A message from Pope Francis was read out, in which the pontiff passed on his heartfelt condolences to David Amess’s family.","LONDON: Prime Minister Boris Johnson joined other senior British politicians and mourners on Tuesday for a funeral mass for David Amess, a lawmaker who was murdered at a meeting with voters last month.
Amess, a 69-year-old father of five, was stabbed to death at a church in his constituency at the regular meeting he held to discuss local issues.
The killing of Amess sent shockwaves through the British political system coming five years after another member of parliament (MP) was murdered on the street.
Johnson, who said some cabinet ministers had broken down in tears when he broke the news to them of Amess’s death, was among those present for the service at the Roman Catholic Westminster Cathedral in London conducted by Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the most senior Catholic leader in England and Wales.
Also among the congregation were former prime ministers Theresa May, David Cameron and John Major.
A message from Pope Francis was read out, in which the pontiff passed on his heartfelt condolences to Amess’s family, praising the lawmaker’s  “devoted public service” as shown by his  “deep concern for the poor and the disadvantaged”.
“He showed what you can achieve as an MP to change lives of people up and down the country and he will be much, much missed,” Johnson said in a tribute to the murdered lawmaker on Monday.
Amess, a member of Johnson’s Conservative Party, was first elected to parliament to represent the town of Basildon in 1983, and then nearby Southend West in 1997. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 2015 for his public service.

5,Pakistan condemns arrest of Kashmiri human rights activist,Foreign Office urges international community to hold India accountable for continued clampdown against human rights organisations.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Tuesday strongly condemned the arrest of human rights activist Khuram Parvez in India-held Jammu and Kashmir. 
Arbitrary arrests of human rights activists on orchestrated charges by Indian occupation forces is clear evidence of New Delhi’s state-terrorism and trampling of fundamental human rights in the occupied valley, Foreign Office spokesperson Asim Iftikhar said in a statement issued here. 
The spokesperson said that the reprehensible unwarranted searches by Indian National Investigation Agency at the offices and residence of Khuram Parvez, had also been condemned by international human rights activists and organisations. 
The world is aware that it has become increasingly difficult for human rights organisations and activists to continue their work in India and held Kashmir due to incessant witch hunt by the Hindutva driven RSS-BJP combine over unfounded and motivated allegations, he added. 
Amnesty International had to shut all its operations in India in September 2020 when its bank accounts were frozen by India in an act of reprisal because of their independent reporting on held Kashmir, the spokesperson mentioned. 
He said the UN human rights machinery, independent NGOs and global media had regularly reported on and expressed concerns over increasing intimidation, harassment and reprisal attacks by Indian occupation forces against Kashmiri human rights defenders, journalists and civil society actors since August 5, 2019. 
The spokesperson urged the international community to hold India accountable for continued clamp down against human rights organisations and activists for undertaking their duty to expose gross and systematic human rights violations of Kashmiris occupied valley, and the minorities, especially Muslims, in India.—APP 
Reuters adds: Rights groups, including the United Nations, have criticised the arrest of Khuram Parvez. 
Mary Lawlor, the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders, called Parvez’s arrest “disturbing”. 
“He’s not a terrorist, he’s a human rights defender,” she said in a tweet. 

 



 
Mr Parvez, one of Kashmir’s best known activists, is head of Jammu Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society, a group of rights organisations working in the region. 
He was arrested and detained on similar charges in 2016, after being prevented from boarding a flight to attend a UN human rights forum in Geneva. He was eventually released without being convicted of any crime.

6,"Europe battles Covid surge as WHO warns of 700,000 more deaths",WHO says the evidence is growing that vaccine-induced protection against infection and mild disease is declining.,"COPENHAGEN: Europe remains “in the firm grip” of Covid-19 and the continent’s death toll could top 2.2 million this winter if current trends continue, the World Health Organisation warned on Tuesday.
Europe is battling an upsurge in the pandemic that saw Austria return to lockdown this week while Germany and the Netherlands are poised to announce new restrictions.
Another 700,000 Europeans could die by March 1, the WHO said, in addition to the 1.5 million who have already succumbed to the virus.
It expects “high or extreme stress in intensive care units (ICUs) in 49 out of 53 countries between now and March 1, 2022”.
Europe’s return to the pandemic’s epicentre has been blamed on sluggish vaccine uptake in some nations, the highly contagious Delta variant, colder weather moving people indoors again and the easing of restrictions.
In the European Union, 67.7 per cent of the population is fully vaccinated.

Europe’s return to pandemic’s epicentre blamed on sluggish vaccine uptake in some nations

But rates vary widely between countries, with low levels in many eastern countries. Only 24.2 per cent of Bulgarians are fully vaccinated, compared to 86.7 per cent in Portugal.
According to WHO data, Covid-related deaths in its European region of 53 countries increased last week to nearly 4,200 a day, doubling from 2,100 deaths a day at the end of September.
It said evidence was growing that vaccine-induced protection against infection and mild disease was declining.
Several countries, including Greece, France and Germany, are moving towards requiring a third booster shot for someone to be considered fully vaccinated.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned that Germany is not doing enough to curb its “highly dramatic” fourth wave of the pandemic.
With intensive care beds swiftly filling up and its weekly incidence rate at an all-time high of 399.8 new infections per 100,000 people, Germany’s worst-hit regions have ordered new shutdowns, including the closure of Christmas markets.
The US State Department has urged Americans not to travel to Germany and neighbouring Denmark because of surging Covid cases.
Austria meanwhile closed shops, restaurants and festive markets on Monday, the most drastic restrictions seen in Western Europe for months.
Challenging winter ahead Israel, which is part of the WHO’s European region, on Tuesday rolled out vaccinations for children aged 5 to 11, one of only a handful of countries to inoculate minors that young.
About half of its recently confirmed cases were among those below the age of 11, it said.
And France’s fully vaccinated Prime Minister Jean Castex went into isolation late on Monday following a positive test, after his daughter caught the virus.
The regional director for WHO Europe, Hans Kluge, said Europe and Central Asia “face a challenging winter ahead”. He called for a “vaccine plus” approach, consisting of a combination of vaccinations, social distancing, the use of face masks and hand washing.
The WHO said face masks reduce Covid incidence by 53 per cent according to a recent study, and “over 160,000 deaths could be prevented (by March 1) if universal mask coverage of 95 per cent was achieved”.
But the prospect of a winter under renewed restrictions has sparked unrest in several countries.
Belgium, the Netherlands and France’s Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique were on Tuesday still reeling from violent protests against new anti-Covid measures.
Dutch police arrested at least 21 people during a fourth night of clashes, which Prime Minister Mark Rutte labelled “pure violence” by “idiots”.
His Belgian counterpart Alexander De Croo called violence at a 35,000-strong protest in Brussels “absolutely unacceptable”.

7,Alarm grows over Ethiopia war,ADDIS ABABA: International alarm mounted on Tuesday over the escalating war in Ethiopia as Tigrayan rebels claimed ...,"ADDIS ABABA: International alarm mounted on Tuesday over the escalating war in Ethiopia as Tigrayan rebels claimed to be edging closer to the capital Addis Ababa and more foreign citizens were told to leave.
US envoy Jeffrey Feltman spoke of some progress in efforts to reach a diplomatic settlement to end the brutal year-long conflict, but warned it risked being jeopardised by  “alarming developments” on the ground.
France became the latest country to tell its citizens to get out of Ethiopia, while the United Nations has ordered the immediate evacuation of family members of international staff, according to an internal document on Tuesday.
The rebel Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) claimed this week it had taken a town just 220 kilometres (135 miles) from the capital, although battlefield claims are hard to verify because of a communications blackout. On Monday, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on Monday vowed he would head to the battlefront to lead his soldiers in what the government has described as an  “existential war” in Africa’s second most populous nation.

International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi made the remarks after meeting with officials including Iran’s atomic energy chief in Tehran ahead of negotiations next week aimed at salvaging the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.
Grossi also met with Iran’s foreign minister, who urged the IAEA to  “avoid taking political positions”.
The visit comes after the IAEA said Iran had boosted its stockpile of highly enriched uranium to many times in excess of the limit laid down in the landmark accord.
“Our work has been intense since the morning,” Grossi said at a joint news conference in Tehran with Mohammad Eslami, the chief of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran.
