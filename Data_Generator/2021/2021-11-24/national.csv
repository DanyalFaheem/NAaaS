Speaking at the Quetta Chamber of Commerce and Industry here on Tuesday, he dispelled the perception that high-speed gas meters were installed in Quetta and other areas. 
“I admit that gas is not being supplied to Nawan Killi. New pipelines are being laid at a cost of Rs3 billion to meet the gas needs of the growing population. Consumers take off their meters when no one is around,” he said. 
Mr Siddiqui said the population of Quetta had increased manifold which also created problems of gas theft and meter tampering. 
He said a 17km and 12-inch pipeline from Zarghoonabad to FC Hospital and other areas had been planned. Due to 60 per cent losses, Balochistan’s share in penalty was Rs12 billion while 55pc of the meters brought to the company were tampered with, he added.

3,ECP forms three panels to enforce EVM legislation,"Committees will look into technical aspects, financial implications and suggest amendments to existing laws, rules.","ISLAMABAD: The Election Commi­ssion of Pakistan (ECP) on Tuesday formed three panels to ‘implement’ legislation on electronic voting machines (EVMs) and voting facility for overseas Pakistanis.  
The development comes days after a record number of bills, including the controversial election-related bills, were bulldozed at a joint sitting of parliament amidst noisy protest by the opposition and accusations that the government plans to electronically steal the 2023 general elections.  
According to the ECP, the first committee will look into the technical aspects, the second financial cost of the process and the third will point out difficulties and suggest amendments to the existing laws and rules.  

Committees will look into technical aspects, financial implications and  suggest amendments to existing laws, rules

The technical committee headed by the ECP secretary has a mandate to look into electoral technologies, identify global standard and best international practices, scope of work, policy, strategy of machine production, its technical and functional examination and to prepare a final concept paper.  
This committee will also prepare request for proposal (RFP) while remaining within the ambit of law and point out future needs in this respect. It will also suggest the required process and mode of implementation.  
The second committee headed by the additional secretary (admin) will look into the financial implications of introducing EVMs and overseas voting. It will make proposals concerning pilot testing and mechanism for their use. The committee will also make recommendations on budget requirement of the ECP and other associated matters, including storage of EVMs on a short- and long-term basis.  
The ECP has already proposed a project to the Planning Commission for storage facility at H-11/4, Islamabad, and allocation of a government building as a stopgap arrangement.  
The mandate of the third committee headed by the director general (law) is to make a comparative analysis of the laws governing electoral processes, identify difficulties and suggest amendments to the existing laws and rules.  
The ECP secretary had on November 18 said he was unsure about the use of EVMs in the next general elections. The issue had come under discussion at a meeting of the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Law and Justice and the ECP secretary briefed the panel on the machine.  
He had said it was premature to confirm the use of EVMs in the next general elections due to certain challenges, adding that the ECP should undertake three to four pilot projects before using the machines in the general elections. Moreover, he added, the commission still had to figure out the exact number of EVMs for each polling station.  
Serious flaws in the EVM bill had also been highlighted at the meeting. A PML-N lawmaker had said the bill introduced electronic voting without omitting the provision of manual voting which meant that at present the Elections Act allowed both electronic and manual voting in elections.  
Months before the passage of the poll-related bills by parliament, the ECP had raised objections to 45 of the total 72 proposed amendments in the first bill. The commission found 15 amendments repugnant to the Constitution and five inconsistent with the Elections Act itself. A total of 17 amendments had been opposed by the commission on administrative grounds.  
The ECP had raised as many as 37 objections over the plan to introduce EVMs. It said the time was too short for a large-scale procurement and deployment of EVMs and imparting training to a massive number of operators, adding that it was not advisable to introduce EVM nationwide in one go.  
A document submitted to a Senate committee in September said the polls on one day as required under the law would be nearly impossible.  
The ECP also referred to various other issues linked with the use of EVM, including lack of ballot secrecy, lack of capacity at all levels and lack of ensuring security and chain of custody for the machines at rest and during transportation. It also pointed out that there would be no evidence available in case of election dispute.  
The ECP noted that data integration and configuration issues might crop up due to court orders at the eleventh hour regarding a change in ballot paper. The commission said there was an absence of dust- and humid-free controlled temperature environment warehouse for storage. It said a huge learning curve was required for technical operators, adding that there was no consensus among the stakeholders on EVM which was also not financially feasible.  
The ECP said EVM could not prevent low voters’ turnout, low women’s turnout, misuse of state authority, election fraud, electronic ballot stuffing, vote buying, the law and order situation, dishonest polling staff, widespread political and electoral violence and abuse of state resources.

7,"SCBA defends Lahore moot proceedings, rejects allegations of pushing an agenda",Says the association does not endorse any particular speaker’s point of view.,"ISLAMABAD: The third Annual Asma Jahangir Conference was an attempt to bridge the growing polarisation in society, the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) explained on Tuesday amid a vicious campaign against the event’s organisers.  
In a statement, the SCBA rejected the allegations made by certain quarters of furthering any agenda other than that of a progressive and democratic Pakistan.  
The conference provided an opportunity to key stakeholders from the judiciary, lawyers, human rights activists, journalists, the government and the opposition to speak and listen to each other, the statement said.  

Says the association does not endorse any particular speaker’s point of view

“Freedom of expression is crucial for democratic progress and this requires giving space to and listening to critical voices and voices that we disagree with,” emphasised the statement issued under the signature of SCBA secretary Waseem Mumtaz Malik.  
The statement explained that the SCBA co-hosted the Asma Jahangir conference with the Pakistan Bar Council and AGHS Legal Aid Cell.  
The two-day conference, held on Nov 20 and 21 in Lahore, was addressed by a number of key speakers, including Chief Justice of Pakistan Gulzar Ahmed, Justice Qazi Faez Isa of the Supreme Court, Chief Justice of the Islamabad High Court Athar Minallah, former SCBA president Ali Ahmed Kurd, Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement chief Manzoor Pashteen and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif. 
The conference’s organisers blamed the state for blocking Mr Sharif’s speech three times, whereas the government’s side accused the organisers of providing a convicted person with an opportunity to address the event.  
“No one was invited or given an opportunity to speak at the conference in violation of any law,” the statement said, adding that the Pakistan Electronic Media Authority banned certain categories of individuals from being broadcast on television, but no such prohibition was in place to stop them from addressing public gatherings in general.  
The SCBA explained that the conference provided a platform to a wide cross section of Pakistani society to engage in a dialogue in the spirit of upholding the rule of law, fundamental rights and democratic values. 
The SCBA said it was indebted in particular to the superior judiciary, the Chief Justice of Pakistan, chief justices of Lahore and Islamabad high courts, and other judges who graced the occasion and enriched the conference with their presence and insights. 
The association believed that adherence to the law was a cornerstone of any democracy, the statement said, adding that the speakers were invited to the conference to give their views and kick-start important and sometimes uncomfortable conversations. The SCBA and Asma Jahangir conference did not endorse any speaker’s point of view but provided a platform to diverse voices across Pakistan on critical issues, it said. 
“Freedom of expression is crucial for democratic progress and this requires giving space to and listening to critical voices and voices that we disagree with,” it said. “The SCBA and Asma Jahangir conference attempted to bridge the growing polarisation in society.” 
The SCBA emphasised that the conference was a tribute to the legacy, vision and mission of Asma Jahangir, who was a leader and inspiration to all. “Ms Jahangir stood for freedom of expression and for fundamental rights even for her worse enemies,” the statement said, stressing that her stand was based on her unshakeable convictions and principles, and not on personalities. “She spoke up for the media houses and political parties that viciously attacked her in the past.” 
The SCBA was also committed to her vision and would not be deterred and intimidated by vicious and baseless attacks, the statement said. “The rule of law, due process and constitutionalism present the only way forward for our country and the SCBA wants to play a constructive role in this journey while maintaining neutrality in partisan politics,” it added.

8,PMC okays registration of three Balochistan medical colleges,Over 600 male and female students have been studying in the three medical colleges.,"QUETTA: The Pakistan Medical Commission (PMC) has approved registration of three new medical colleges of Balochistan which were operational from 2018 without registration.
These institutions — the Loralai Medical College, Jhalawan Medical College and Makran Medical College — were established by the previous provincial governments of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and National Party headed by former chief ministers Dr Malik Baloch and Nawab Sanaullah Zehri with coalition partners Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl and Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party.
Over 600 male and female students were studying in these three medical colleges, but because required formalities were not completed the PMC had not approved their registration during the past four years.
Official sources said here on Tuesday that after completion of formalities and provision of required equipment and other facilities to these colleges and teaching hospitals the officials of the PMC visited them and recommended their registration.
“The council of PMC has approved the registration of all the three medical colleges of Balochistan,” the Balochistan’s health department officials said, adding that the PMC council gave the approval in its meeting held in Islamabad.
They said the Combined Military Hospital (CMH) and the Pakistan Army played a positive role in the approval of the registration of these institutions.
They said with the registration of these colleges students of far-flung areas of Balochistan would be able to obtain higher medical education which would help in overcoming the shortage of doctors in the province.
The Balochistan health secretary thanked the PMC president for taking personal interest in registration of the three medical colleges.
The provincial government also thanked the Pakistan Army and the PMC for their cooperation in the approval of the registration of these institutions.
