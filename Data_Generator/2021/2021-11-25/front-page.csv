0,Maryam asks ex-CJP not to hide behind institution,Ministers say her confession of buying media houses warrants official probe,"ISLAMABAD: While claiming successive events have exposed the conspiracy hatched against her party, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz vice president Maryam Nawaz has said it is about time the judiciary and army did some introspection, saying individuals such as former Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Saqib Nisar and an ex-spymaster should not hide behind their institutions. 
Addressing a press conference, Ms Nawaz claimed that at least five testimonies had emerged to substantiate the PML-N’s stance that ex-CJP Nisar was actively involved in the conspiracy to disqualify a thrice-elected prime minister and sending him and herself to jail. 
She said former justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui, who publicly admitted interference in the constitution of judicial benches, disclosed in his petition, which was still pending before the SC, that the spymaster wanted to prolong her and her father’s detention until after the 2018 general elections. 
She said the late judge of the accountability court Arshad Malik also confessed to convicting Mr Sharif under duress, the then CJP Asif Saeed Khosa termed this ‘a stigma for judiciary’ and the judge’s service was terminated but the conviction of Mr Sharif still stood. 

Ministers say her confession of buying media houses warrants official probe 

She said the affidavit of ex-chief justice of Gilgit-Baltistan Rana Mohammad Shamim also lent strength to what Justice Siddiqui and Judge Malik had come up with. Also, the alleged audio of ex-CJP Nisar substantiated he was following someone’s orders for convicting the Sharif family, while former director general of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Bashir Memon, too, had made certain revelations about the victimisation, she added. 
She alleged that Justice Nisar misused his authority to victimize the PML-N. “This is the first-ever case in which the Supreme Court has become a party by directing National Accountability Bureau of filing references against the Sharif family, constituted joint investigation team comprising so-called ‘jewel’ through WhatsApp calls,” she said. 
She further alleged the ex-CJP Nisar refused to face courts over the affidavit and the leaked audio saying “he is not insane and will not approach any court of law”. She then recalled that an ‘insane’ elected prime minister had appeared before a BS-18 officer in connection with Panama Papers probe.  
According to her, the appointment of a monitoring judge in the Sharif family case was also unprecedented.  
The PML-N leader further alleged that ex-CJP Nisar removed her father from the office of PML-N president, participated in the election campaign of Sheikh Rashid, did not allow PML-N’s candidate to contest the Senate elections with party symbol. 
She said the ex-CJP set different standards for Prime Minister Imran Khan by accepting his ‘fake’ money trail, overlooking the union council’s testimony about ‘forged’ permission for the construction of his palatial house at Banigala.

She claimed that ex-CJP Asif Saeed Khosa had encouraged Mr Khan to pursue the petition seeking disqualification of her father despite the fact that the registrar office of the apex court had termed it ‘frivolous’. 
According to her, the leaked audio and the self-explanatory facts did not need any affidavit to be legitimized. 
The PML-N vice president said that soon after the audio leak, ex-CJP Nisar termed it ‘fake’, but when a private TV channel claimed it was edited the ex-CJP ‘recognized’ his audio. She then thanked the channel for what she said reminding Justice Nisar of his voice and expressed the hope that the channel would soon run the speech on air in which the ex-CJP talked about bringing Mr Khan into power and convicting the PML-N leadership. 
She requested the judiciary and the army not to compromise their prestige in what she called an attempt “to rescue individuals who allegedly brought their respective institutions to disrepute”. 
Earlier, the PML-N vice president appeared before the Islamabad High Court division bench comprising Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani. 
Since her counsel Irfan Qadir sought adjournment on account of his appearance before the SC, the bench allowed the application and adjourned hearing till December 21. 
Govt reaction
Later in a joint press conference, federal ministers Fawad Chaudhry and Hammad Azhar criticised Maryam Nawaz for maligning the judiciary. 
Mr Chaudhry said since Ms Nawaz in her presser had admitted to have headed PML-N’s media cell and interfered into the release of government ads to media groups, she confessed to committing an offence that may be fall within the FIA ambit. 
“Disbursement of public fund by a private person is a schedule offence of the FIA,” he said. 
He said her media cell had given advertisements for billions of rupees to their party’s favourite media houses and also paid handsomely to journalists to buy their loyalties. 
“We have decided to inquire this matter at the level of the ministry of information,” Mr Chaudhry said. However, he said, their next course of action would be made public later. 
Mr Azhar said her confession of buying media houses was ‘intolerable’. “We have asked the provinces for the details of advertisements released to media houses during the PML-N regime and we will also examine the journalists who got plots or monitory benefit by the PML-N media cell,” the minister said.

2,PM terms former chief justice’s audio tape leak a ‘drama’,Deplores a ‘convict’ addressed an event where CJP was invited,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday termed the leaked audio tape allegedly of former chief justice Saqib Nisar “a drama” saying it (emergence of such tapes) started when the corruption of the Sharif family was exposed in the Panama Papers.  
In the tape, former chief justice Saqib Nisar is purportedly telling someone that it is imperative to keep Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz behind bars to bring Imran Khan to power.  
Addressing the Kamyab Jawan Convention, the prime minister, while referring to Asma Jahangir Conference recently held in Lahore, lamented that self-exiled former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who had been convicted in Panama Papers case, was allowed to address the event to which senior judges of the Supreme Court were invited.  “It was unfortunate that the chief justice of Pakistan and a convict (Nawaz Sharif) were invited to speak at the same event,” he said.  

Deplores a ‘convict’ addressed an event where CJP was invited   

The prime minister said the Sharif family maligned the state institution when it was asked to give money trail of four costly apartments in London. “When Nawaz Sharif was convicted, he first raised the slogan “Mujhe Kyun Nikala” (why was I removed) and later “the army, the judiciary and I were maligned. I was called a brutal man”.  
A few days ago a controversy generated after PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif’s address via video link was disrupted when its livestream was abruptly stopped at Asma Jahangir Conference.  
“There was a function in Lahore where the chief justice and Supreme Court judges were invited and who addresses that event? A man who has been convicted by the Supreme Court and who has absconded from the country,” the prime minister said. “It is unfortunate.”  
The prime minister said nations were destroyed when they stopped considering looting money a bad thing.  
Giving example of the state of Madina, he said the foundation the state was laid on the basis of differentiating between right and wrong and denouncing the bad.  
“A country where its head, prime minister and ministers start stealing and taking public funds abroad [...] Countries are not poor because of a lack of resources, they become poor when government functionaries start stealing from the people. Such a country can never progress.”  
Commenting on the Panama Papers, the premier said the investigation revealed that PML-N leader Maryam Nawaz owned four flats in London.  
“Where did this money [for the apartments] come from?” he asked, and continued: “You may call the courts bad, you may call the army bad and I have already been [dubbed] bad ... But answer from where did you get the money to buy those apartments.”  
“On the contrary, Nawaz Sharif first told a lie in National Assembly, then came the Qatari letter and the Calibri font. They have not so far presented even a single paper [of evidence] about the financial source of flats,” he remarked.  
The prime minister said that when corruption was not considered a crime, it destroyed the nations.  
Mr Khan said he was also dragged to the court over an apartment he owned in the United Kingdom, when he was a cricket star. “But, I, submitted all details [regarding the case] to the court,” he added. “I produced all the receipts, but they (PML-N leaders) lied in the National Assembly [regarding their assets].”  
Not a single document [has been shared] that shows the means to buy the flats [owned by them],” he said.  
‘Opportunity to change lives’ 
During the function, the prime minister launched four projects for the uplift of the youth. The projects are: Kamyab Jawan Markaz, Kamyab Jawan Green Youth Movement, Kamyab Jawan Innovation League and Kamyab Jawan Talent Hunt Youth Sports League.  
The prime minister said such projects gave the people an opportunity to develop skills, get loans to start the businesses and “change their lives”.  
Sharing his experiences and difficulties he had faced during his career in cricket, politics and philanthropy, he said he was able to overcome challenges through hard work and because he dreamt big.  
The premier said that when he started his political journey 25 years ago, he found corruption to be the country’s biggest problem.  
“There was a corrupt system in place and that’s why it is taking longer to make things right,” he said, adding that the nation, however, had great potential and was on its way to rise and “become something that is beyond imagination”.

4,NA panel’s head disallows vote on NAB bills,Opposition up in arms over standing committee chairman’s decision.,"ISLAMABAD: Opposition members of the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Law and Justice on Wednesday protested over the committee chairman’s refusal to put the controversial bills seeking to amend the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO) for vote after realising that the government might face a defeat. 
Of the 20 committee members including its chairman Riaz Fatyana, six members from the treasury and 10 opposition members were present at the meeting that had been convened to consider five bills, including the NAO (Second Amendment) Bill, 2021 and the NAO (Third Amendment) Bill, 2021. 
Turning down the opposition’s demand to put the two bills for a vote, Mr Fatyana asked the members to submit their concerns, reservations and proposals over the two bills in writing before adjourning the meeting. 
The government has already enforced the two laws through promulgation of the ordinances. The first ordinance allows the government to extend the tenure of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) chairman till the appointment of his successor and through the second ordinance, the powers to appoint NAB chairman have been delegated to the president. 

Opposition up in arms over standing committee chairman’s decision 

During the deliberations on the bills, a majority of the opposition members criticised the government for doing legislation through presidential ordinances. The opposition members expressed their concerns over the procedure of NAB chairman’s nomination as well as the appointment of retired district and sessions judges as judges of the accountability courts and fixation of retirement age for the judges of accountability courts up to 68 years. 
Sources told Dawn that during the meeting, the opposition members bombarded Law Minister Farogh Naseem with questions over government’s move to extend the tenure of incumbent NAB chairman Javed Iqbal and giving powers of NAB chairman’s appointment to the president. 
After the meeting, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) information secretary Marriyum Aurangzeb issued a statement claiming that the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government had suffered a defeat at the hands of the opposition on the second and third amendment bills of the NAB in the standing committee. 
It said the law minister arrived at the meeting half an hour late and after a heated debate, he left the committee room at a time when the opposition members were demanding a vote on the bills. 
During the meeting, PML-N lawmaker Rana Sanaullah said as collective decisions of the cabinet had been excluded from NAB scope according to the amendment bill, who would take action over a wrong decision of the cabinet. Also, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and the anti-corruption department could not take action in this regard when their heads were appointed by the government, he said, adding that the heads of these institutions did not even have legal protection. He was of the opinion that it would have been better if those matters had remained with the accountability bureau. 
Pakistan Peoples Party lawmaker Syed Naveed Qamar said they should take advantage of this opportunity to draft objective legislation without any shortcomings and loopholes if they had lost opportunities in the past. 
PML-N legislator Mahmood Bashir Virk was of the opinion that amendments to the NAB law had not been made in good faith and were based on mala fide intention. He called for rejection of the bills. 
Also, Khawaja Saad Rafique of the PML-N said the authority to issue ordinances existed only for extremely special circumstances. He said the NAB ordinances were against the spirit of the Constitution. He made the offer that the opposition could sit with the government on the issue if it withdrew the controversial bills. 
While opposing government’s move to grant extension in the term of the NAB chairman, Mr Rafique said empowering the president to appoint the head of watchdog meant that NAB would remain subservient to the government. He believed the new proposed laws would be overturned by any court at the very first hearing. 
Talking to Dawn, a PTI member of the committee Lal Chand criticised the opposition for playing double standards in committee’s meeting. He said the opposition had offered to the government that it was ready to sit with it and discuss the laws for purpose of improvement but when it saw treasury members were not present in full strength, they started making the demand for a vote on the bills so that they could get them rejected. 
The PTI lawmaker said Mr Fatyana had already declared they would carry out the first and second readings of the bills and it would be put for a vote if the committee failed to develop a consensus. 
At the outset, the committee members took notice of the violence against a woman by a group of lawyers in Malir district courts after PTI’s Chand raised the issue. The committee directed the Sindh High Court registrar to submit an incident report. 
Besides Mr Chand, Mr Ataullah, Maleeka Bokhari, Junaid Akbar and Shunila Ruth of the PTI and Kishwar Zehra of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement represented the government in the meeting. From the opposition side, the meeting was attended by Mr Sanaullah, Mr Virk, Usman Ibraheem, Mr Rafique and Mohsin Nawaz Ranjha of the PML-N, Qadir Khan Mandokhail, Nafeesa Shah and Syed Naveed Qamar of the PPP, Aliya Kamran of the JUI-F and Agha Hassan Baloch of the BNP-Mengal attended the meeting.
