Robert Duckscheer scored a brace to give the Germans a winning start in Pool ‘D’.
Six-time world champions Germany were in dominant form as they scored twice in the first quarter with  Struthhoff Michael and Duckscheer scoring in the first and 14th minutes.
Abdul Shaheed hit back for Pakistan in the 18th but the Germans restored their advantage through Siegburg Maximilian in the very next minute and Benedikt Schwarzhaupt made it 4-1 in the 22nd. 
Pakistan tried to change momentum through Hammaduddin Mohammad’s late push-back in the 49th but Duckscheer sealed victory for the Germans with his second six minutes from time.
Germany will next face Argentina on Friday, a day before Pakistan take on Egypt in their second pool match.
In other matches on the opening day of the tournament, Poland edged Canada 1-0 to take early control of Pool ‘B’. 
Belgium and Malaysia both got off to winning starts in Pool ‘A’; the Belgians seeing off South Africa 5-1 while Malaysia edged past Chile 2-1.

1,Spinners put Sri Lanka close to victory against WI,West Indies had made just 52 before bad light forced an early end after the hosts’ spin trio made quick work of the top order.,"GALLE: Sri Lanka need just four wickets to win the first Test against West Indies in Galle after setting the all-but-impossible target of 348 on Wednesday’s penultimate day of play.
West Indies had made just 52 before bad light forced an early end after the hosts’ spin trio made quick work of the top order. 
The sensational collapse saw the tourists lose four wickets in 15 balls for just four runs. 
Ramesh Mendis was the pick of the bowlers finishing with four for 17. The off-spinner had the makings of a hat-trick as he trapped Kyle Mayers leg before. 
Jason Holder was expecting the ball to turn into him on the next delivery but a straight path smashed his off-stump. 
Joshua da Silva walked in to face the hat-trick ball but it was wayward from Mendis, who bowled down the leg-side. 
Lasith Embuldeniya accounted for Jermaine Blackwood and Roston Chase.
There was little hope for West Indies at 18 for six and all signs were that the game was going to end on the fourth day. 
Then Nkrumah Bonner (18) and da Silva (15) batted for just over 45 minutes to hang in before the umpires called bad light. 
West Indies’ collapse began when Mendis trapped West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite lbw without scoring in the fourth over. Angelo Mathews took a brilliant catch diving forward at mid-on to dismiss Blackwood (9) off left-arm spinner Embuldeniya. 
“Everyone is disappointed in the dressing room,” Bonner told reporters. “But then, it’s up to me and Josh to get the job done. We have about 640 balls to bat. We want to play each ball on merit and respect the bowlers... It’s a simple plan: bat as much as possible tomorrow.” 
West Indies’ lowest total against Sri Lanka is 93 all out in Barbados in 2018. 
Sri Lanka declared their second innings on 191 for four after a 123-run stand by Angelo Mathews and Dimuth Karunaratne in just 150 deliveries. 
Skipper Karunaratne, who had posted 147 in the first innings, narrowly missed twin centuries with 83, including nine fours. 
He finally stumbled after attempting to cut Rahkeem Cornwall, a top edge knocking the ball off the wicketkeeper’s gloves and into the hands of first slip.
Karunaratne has been prolific this year with over 850 runs now at an average of 77. He is the world’s third-highest run getter in Test cricket for 2021, behind England’s Joe Root and India’s Rohit Sharma. 
“I have little doubt that by the time he’s done, he will be amongst the top three run scorers for Sri Lanka,” Mathews, who hit two sixes and six boundaries for 69 not out, said of his team-mate after play ended. 
The West Indies were 230 all out in the first innings, with nine wickets falling to Sri Lanka’s spinners. Left-armer Praveen Jayawickrama was the pick of the bowlers with four scalps to his name. 
The fourth day’s play was delayed by one hour due to rain. A total of 52 overs were lost on day three due to rain.

2,Bangladesh suffer Shakib blow ahead of first Pakistan Test,"DHAKA: Bangladesh will be without star all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan for the first Test against Pakistan, which begins...","DHAKA: Bangladesh will be without star all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan for the first Test against Pakistan, which begins in Chittagong on Friday.
Shakib will join opener Tamim Iqbal on the sidelines, adding to a lack of confidence in the Bangladesh camp after losing eight straight Twenty20 internationals, meaning Pakistan will start as overwhelming favourites.
The visitors completed a clean sweep 3-0 in the preceding Twenty20 series.
Shakib suffered a hamstring injury against the West Indies in Sharjah last month that ended his T20 World Cup, but he had been included in the Test squad in the hope that he would regain his fitness.
But Bangladesh’s chief selector Minhajul Abedin said on Tuesday:  “Shakib hasn’t recovered from his injury yet. He needs further rehabilitation. Our physiotherapist is constantly taking care of him.”
Tamim was left out of the Test squad as he recovers from a finger injury and is unlikely to resume training until next month, said a Bangladesh Cricket Board official.
Minhajul was confident Bangladesh would be able to make up for the absence of Shakib.
“We have options in the spin department as well as in pace. The team for the first Test is made up of cricketers who have been playing together regularly and they know the demand of Test matches,” he said.
“Pakistan are a formidable team but we are confident that Bangladesh will be competitive if we are disciplined and patient.”
Pakistan have played 10 Tests against Bangladesh, winning nine. Bangladesh’s only draw came in 2015 when Tamim scored a maiden Test double hundred in a record 312-run opening stand with Imrul Kayes in the second innings in Khulna.
The second Test will start in Dhaka on December 4.

4,"United, Chelsea advance in CL; Barca made to wait","PARIS: Energised by a change of manager and another opportunistic finish by Cristiano Ronaldo, Manchester United...","PARIS: Energised by a change of manager and another opportunistic finish by Cristiano Ronaldo, Manchester United qualified for the knockout stage of the Champions League with a game to spare on Tuesday.
Another newly-appointed coach sill has work to do, though, to get Barcelona into the last 16. 
United were led for the first time by Michael Carrick following the weekend firing of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and, just like his predecessor, the interim manager was left to be thankful for a goal by the Champions League’s record scorer. 
Ronaldo produced a sublime lobbed finish to put United ahead against Villarreal and a 90th-minute strike by Jadon Sancho his first goal since joining for $100 million in the offseason sealed a 2-0 win to secure progress as the winners of Group ‘F’. Ronaldo has scored in all five group games so far, and now has a record-extending 140 Champions League goals in his career. 
“It’s not an important result for me personally. It’s an important one for the players and the club,” said Carrick. 
Another English side, defending champions Chelsea, also advanced on the back of a 4-0 win over already-qualified Juventus, who slumped to their heaviest ever loss in the Champions League. 
Barca, now coached by former star midfielder Xavi Hernandez, have advanced from their group every season for almost two decades but a 0-0 draw at home to Benfica means the Spanish club might need to beat Bayern Munich in the final round of games to advance. 
All four teams in Group ‘G’ are separated by three points and could still qualify heading into their last games after wins for Lille and Sevilla over Salzburg and VfL Wolfsburg, respectively. 
RONALDO DELIVERS AGAIN 
Ronaldo had already scored two winners and a late equaliser in the Champions League this season before his smartly taken go-ahead goal against Villarreal in the 78th minute, prompted by Fred winning the ball high up the field. 
And both Fred and Ronaldo featured in a counterattack that ended with Sancho, so often a peripheral figure since his big-money move from Borussia Dortmund in the close-season, smashing a shot in off the underside of the crossbar to seal the win.
Carrick made a big call in his first game in charge by dropping playmaker Bruno Fernandes in a bid to set up in a more solid fashion and protect a defence that has been overrun this season. It led to a first clean sheet of the group stage. 
More joy was to follow as Atalanta’s wild 3-3 draw at Young Boys meant United cannot be displaced as group leader courtesy of their superior head-to-head record against Villarreal, who are three points back in second place. Atalanta are a point further back. 
Late goals from Vincent Sierro and Silvan Hefti gave Swiss champions Young Boys a 3-2 lead in Bern, but Luis Muriel struck in the 88th minute for the visitors. 
Atalanta face a winner-takes-all match against Villarreal in Bergamo next month. 
BITTERSWEET FOR CHELSEA
It was a bittersweet night for Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel. 
The thrashing of Juventus, achieved courtesy of goals by academy graduates Trevoh Chalobah, Reece James and Callum Hudson-Odoi as well as a fourth by substitute Timo Werner, was marred by knee injuries to key players N’Golo Kante and Ben Chilwell. 
Kante went off in the first half at Stamford Bridge while Chilwell looked in agony as he was helped off the field in the 71st.  
The Blues dominated the early stages and took the lead through young defender Chalobah’s third goal of the season. 
England right-back Reece James hammered a fine volley into the bottom corner to net for the fifth time already this term in the 56th minute. Chelsea grabbed their third goal less than two minutes later, Ruben Loftus-Cheek prodding the ball to Hudson-Odoi, who smashed home from close range. 
There was still time for Werner, making his first appearance since an injury layoff, to come off the bench and score in added time.  
Chelsea and Juventus are tied on 12 points with a game left to play while Zenit St. Petersburg are assured of finishing third in Group ‘H’ and going into the Europa League knockout stage after drawing 1-1 at Malmo. 
NERVY FINISH
Barca missed a string of chances at the Camp Nou and stayed two points ahead of Benfica in Group ‘E’. 
If Barca fail to beat Bayern away, Benfica could overtake the Spanish club with a win at home to already-eliminated Dynamo Kiev. If they finish tied on points, Benfica would advance courtesy of their head-to-head record. 
Helping Barca is the fact that Bayern have little to play for except, maybe, the chance to knock out a historic rival, albeit one that has lost its aura following the departure of Lionel Messi and other big-name players amid financial problems. 
“We played well but there’s a bitter aftertaste because we were here to win tonight,” Barca defender Ronald Araujo told uefa.com. “In front of our fans, our people — and now we simply must go and win in Munich.” 
Bayern had already qualified for the last 16 before their 2-1 win at Dynamo Kyiv and the result secured the German champions first place in the group.
Robert Lewandowski with an overhead kick and Kingsley Coman scored the goals for a threadbare Bayern squad missing nine players, with seven unavailable because either they tested positive for the coronavirus or were unvaccinated and had contact with a positive case. 
LILLE TOP
Lille moved top of their group after Canada striker Jonathan David scored his 12th goal of the season to seal a 1-0 win over Salzburg, who dropped a point back in second. 
Sevilla jumped into third place, above Wolfsburg, with a 2-0 victory over the German team thanks to goals by Joan Jordan and Rafa Mir. 
In the final games, Wolfsburg host Lille and Salzburg are at home to Sevilla.

6,"NZ excited for India spin challenge, says Williamson","“We know the strength of the Indian spin bowlers and they’ve been fantastic for a long period,” says Black Caps captain.","

KANPUR: Indian spinner Ravindra Jadeja bowls during a practice session at the Green Park Stadium on Wednesday.—AFP

 
KANPUR: New Zealand are bracing for a trial by spin in their two-Test series against India but the world champions are excited to face the acid test, captain Kane Williamson said on Wednesday. 
Winning a Test series in spin-dominated India, who have not lost a series at home since late 2012, remains one of the most arduous tasks for every team in the sport.
The series between India and New Zealand, starting with the opening match at Kanpur on Thursday, will be the first between the sides since they met in the final of the World Test Championship at Southampton in June. 
Williamson’s men won that contest but they have never won a test series let alone a test match since the 1988-89 tour. 
“It’s been a while since that final which was a special memory, but we know we’re here against a very strong side and they’re formidable, particularly in their own conditions,” Williamson told reporters. 
“I’m sure throughout the series, the spin component will be a definite factor. I’m sure, it’s no different here in Kanpur.” 
The touring side have had only two training sessions as a full squad, with their Twenty20 players taking part in a three-match series ahead of the Tests. Williamson, who skipped the T20 leg, said they will have to adjust quickly. 
“We know the strength of the Indian spin bowlers and they’ve been fantastic for a long period,” Williamson said, adding that they will be looking at different methods and ways to try and score against the spinners. 
The hosts will be without captain Virat Kohli, who decided to skip the first Test, while openers Rohit Sharma and KL Rahul, wicket-keeper Rishabh Pant and fast bowlers Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami will miss both matches. 
A depleted Indian side will, however, not make New Zealand the favourites, according to Williamson. 
“One of the big strengths of Indian cricket in any format is the depth and we’ve seen that in a lot of ways over the years,” he added. “The knowledge of their own conditions is something that is quite unique for touring teams as well. The challenge is a big one and we’re excited to take that on.” 
India’s stand-in skipper Ajinkya Rahane said his side would miss the first-choice players but their replacements were willing to stand up and be counted. 
“It’s an opportunity for youngsters to back themselves and play with freedom,” said Rahane. 
He brushed aside concerns over his own patchy form, saying he was just one game away from hitting a big score. 
“What I am concerned about is how I can contribute to the team. You cannot score a hundred each time you come out to bat.” 
Rahane, 33, scored a Test century in December but failed to impress in the following home and away series against England. In the WTC final, he made 49 and 15. 
The skipper did not reveal his team combination for the Kanpur match but confirmed that batsman Shreyas Iyer would be making his Test debut Thursday.

7,Al Dawsari’s 16th-second goal spurs Al Hilal to record fourth Asian title,RIYADH: Nasser Al Dawsari scored the fastest goal ever in an Asian Champions League final on Tuesday as Al Hilal won...,"RIYADH: Nasser Al Dawsari scored the fastest goal ever in an Asian Champions League final on Tuesday as Al Hilal won a record fourth continental crown with a 2-0 victory over South Korea’s Pohang Steelers. 
Immediately after kick off at the King Fahd International Stadium, Al-Dawsari picked up a loose ball just inside the Pohang half and advanced to unleash a fierce shot from outside the area that flew into the top corner of Lee Jun’s goal with 16 seconds on the clock. 
It broke Mohamed Kallon’s 16-year-old record and put the Saudis on track for a fourth title after successes in 1991, 2000 and 2019. 
Moussa Marega added a second 18 minutes into the second half as the Riyadh-based club won the title for the second time in three seasons, having defeated Japan’s Urawa Red Diamonds in the final two years ago. 
“This success is for the group,” Al Hilal captain Salman Al Faraj told SSC 7. “A group that works and strives, a group that loves each other, a group together for a long time, and this is the result...two titles in the Asian Champions League, but we deserve it. 
“We are the best team in Asia and we have worked hard to get here. It was a tough game against a good team. We have been together a long time and we are delighted to win the title again.” 
Al Hilal’s victory came a year after they suffered the ignominy of being thrown out of the event following numerous cases of Covid-19 infections within their squad. 
But on Tuesday night those bitter memories were banished as the Saudi giants dominated their opponents in front of 50,000 fans. 
“I am proud of the team, they are a fantastic group of players,” said Al Hilal coach Leonardo Jardim, the first Portuguese coach to win the Asian title. “Winning the tournament was our target from the beginning and I’m happy we have achieved that.” 
Pohang, three-time Asian champions who have been struggling domestically this season, had their best chance 10 minutes into the game when midfielder Sin Jin-ho hit the bar with a shot from outside the area and goalkeeper Abdullah Al-Mayouf saved Lim Sang-hyub’s follow-up from the rebound. 
Al-Hilal secured a place at the FIFA Club World Cup, which will be played early next year in nearby United Arab Emirates. 
“Our objective is to win every game,” added former Monaco boss Jardim.  “The top teams from the world will be there but we will do our best as the champions of Asia.” 
The field for the seven-team FIFA tournament also includes European champions Chelsea, CONCACAF Champions League winner Monterrey of Mexico and African champion Al Ahly of Egypt. 
A Brazilian team will also be at the event with the Copa Libertadores final on Saturday being contested by Palmeiras and Flamengo.

8,Bangladesh's Mahmudullah retires from Test cricket,"The right-hander scored 2,914 runs at an average of 33.49 and took 43 wickets in Tests, captaining the side six times.","DHAKA: Bangladesh all-rounder Mahmudullah Riyad has announced his retirement from test cricket at the age of 35 but will continue to play One-day Internationals and Twenty20s, the country’s cricket board (BCB) said in a statement on Wednesday. 
Mahmudullah’s last Test was against Zimbabwe in Harare in July, where he scored an unbeaten 150 — his fifth Test hundred — in his final innings and led the side to a 220-run victory.  
The right-hander scored 2,914 runs at an average of 33.49 and took 43 wickets in Tests, captaining the side six times. 
Local media reported that Mahmudullah told his teammates during the Zimbabwe Test but waited to make a formal announcement. 
“Leaving a format of which I have been a part of for such a long time is not easy. I had always thought of going on a high and I believe this is the right time to end my test career,” Mahmudullah said in a statement on Wednesday. 
“I thank my teammates and support staff for always encouraging me and believing in my ability. It has been an absolute honour and privilege to play test cricket for Bangladesh and I will cherish the many memories.” 
His announcement came two days before Bangladesh take on Pakistan in the first game of a two-Test series in Chittagong. 
Mahmudullah, the Twenty20 captain of Bangladesh who was not selected for Pakistan Tests, promised to continue playing the other two formats. 
“Although I am retiring from Tests, I will still be playing ODIs and T20 internationals and really looking forward to continue giving my best for my country in white ball cricket,” he said.

10,Vaughan dropped from BBC’s Ashes coverage amid racism row,SALFORD: Former England captain Michael Vaughan will play no part in the BBC’s coverage of the upcoming Ashes...,"SALFORD: Former England captain Michael Vaughan will play no part in the BBC’s coverage of the upcoming Ashes series after being named in the racism controversy involving former Yorkshire player Azeem Rafiq, the broadcaster said on Wednesday. 
Rafiq alleged that Vaughan told him and two other players of Asian origin that there were “too many of you lot, we need to do something about it” before a match in 2009. Vaughan has strongly denied the accusation. 
“While he is involved in a significant story in cricket, for editorial reasons we do not believe that it would be appropriate for Vaughan to have a role in our Ashes team or wider coverage of the sport at the moment,” the BBC said in a statement. “We require our contributors to talk about relevant topics and his involvement in the Yorkshire story represents a conflict of interest.” 
Vaughan said he was disappointed with the decision but added the problems afflicting the sport were bigger than his plight.  
He might still be heard in Britain during the Ashes through his scheduled work for Australian rights-holder Fox Sports, which will provide the audio for BT Sports coverage of the series. The former top-order batsman remains a columnist with Britain’s Daily Telegraph newspaper. 
“Very disappointed not to be commentating for TMS [Test Match Special] on the Ashes and will miss working with great colleagues and friends, but looking forward to being behind the mic for @foxcricket in Australia,” he wrote on Instagram. 
“The issues facing cricket are bigger than any individual case and I want to be part of the solution, listening, educating myself and helping to make it a more welcoming sport for all.” 
The 47-year-old, who has been an analyst with the BBC since 2009, was dropped from a radio show by the broadcaster earlier this month after the allegations came to light. 
The five-test Ashes series between England and hosts Australia begins in Brisbane on Dec 8. 
The racism scandal that has engulfed English cricket also had former players at Essex saying that they suffered racist abuse at the club. 
One of Essex’s principal sponsors — training and skills provider Seetec — have now suspended ties with the team “with immediate effect.”   “Any form of racism should not be tolerated. We encourage sports clubs to work with their local community to celebrate diversity and work at all levels to root out racism, wherever it manifests,” a spokesperson for Seetec said. 
Last week, British sports minister Nigel Huddleston called for cricket to get its house in order and raised the possibility of independent regulation if it did not.

12,Norway criticises Qatar over arrest of reporters in Doha,"Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere says the arrest is ""unacceptable"".","OSLO: Two Norwegian reporters were arrested by police in Qatar this week and held in detention for some 30 hours, their employer said on Wednesday, drawing criticism of the Gulf nation from Norway’s prime minister. 
Journalists Halvor Ekeland and Lokman Ghorbani were in Qatar to report on preparations for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, public broadcaster NRK said. 
Qatar’s hosting of the quadrennial football tournament, the first by a Middle East country, has been controversial, casting a spotlight on conditions for migrant workers, LGBTQ+ rights and allegations of corruption. 
“The arrest of NRK’s journalists in Qatar is unacceptable. A free press is crucial to a functioning democracy,” Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere said in a tweet. 

 



 
Ekeland and Ghorbani were released on Tuesday and left the country shortly after, NRK said. Their equipment had been confiscated however, the broadcaster added. The reporters arrived in Oslo earlier on Wednesday. 
Norwegian news agency NTB later reported that the Qatari ambassador to the country was summoned to Oslo’s foreign ministry over the matter. 
Qatar defended the arrests, adding that the reporters had been detained following complaints of trespassing by the owner of a private property.

13,Australian Cooley to work with England’s pace bowlers ahead of Ashes,Cooley was England’s bowling coach during their 2005 Ashes series success and subsequently took up a similar role with Australia.,"LONDON: Stuart Broad is looking forward to gaining some inside knowledge on Australia after England appointed Troy Cooley as a consultant pace bowling coach ahead of the upcoming Ashes series.
The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced Wednesday that Cooley, a 55-year-old Australian, will aid the tourists’ quicks in Brisbane under the direction of elite pace bowling coach Jon Lewis. 
He will then assist the seamers in England’s second-string Lions squad when they face Australia ‘A’ in a four-day match that starts on December 9. 
Cooley was England’s bowling coach during their 2005 Ashes series success and subsequently took up a similar role with Australia. 
“[Cooley] arrived when we got out of quarantine [on] Saturday, but he’s with us for a decent period of time,” Broad told cricket.com.au. “Really looking forward to picking his brain on Australian conditions, and Australian players, to be honest.” 
Broad (524 Test wickets) and longstanding new-ball partner James Anderson (632) are not only England’s two all-time leading Test wicket-takers, they are the only members of the current squad to have enjoyed Ashes series success in Australia, following their involvement in a 3-1 triumph in 2010/11. 
England, however, have since lost nine of their last 10 Tests in Australia, with just one draw. 
But the 35-year-old Broad hopes Cooley can help redress the balance. 
“He’s been in their setup for a long period of time, through development and at the top level,” the Notting­hamshire seamer said. 
“He can give us great insight into Australian batters’ mentality. What they’re looking to do, where they’re looking to score, where they don’t like the ball, how [we should] be around them — whether you talk to them, whether you ignore them, whether you sledge them...can you annoy them enough to make a mistake. 
“All this sort of detail, we’ll be picking Troy’s brain, because anything you can get, even a one-percenter on someone, will be really useful for us,” added Broad, whose father Chris, an opening batsman, was a key member of England’s 1986/87 Ashes-winning side in Australia. 
“You need all that sort of stuff to win in Australia. You need to be at the top of your game at all times, and find little chinks in the opposition’s armoury.” 
The first Test of an upcoming five-match campaign starts at Brisbane’s Gabba ground on December 8, with Australia holding the Ashes after a drawn 2019 series in England. 
BRISBANE RAIN
Persistent rain saw play abandoned without a ball being bowled on day two of England’s intra-squad tour match at the Peter Burge Oval in Brisbane on Wednesday, delaying the much-anticipated return of star all-rounder Ben Stokes. 
Only 29 overs had been possible on Tuesday, with openers Rory Burns (39 not out) and Haseeb Hameed (53 not out) unbeaten in steering an England XI to 98 without loss against the Lions. 
More rain is expected on Thursday, potentially scuppering Stokes’ return after almost five months out due to mental health concerns and finger surgery.
But if Stokes proves his fitness, England could field an extra fast bowler in the first Test with Anderson, Broad, Chris Woakes, Mark Wood, Ollie Robinson and Craig Overton all looking to gain from Cooley’s expertise. 
England have just one more game scheduled before the first Test — a four-day, intra-squad warm-up from November 30. 
Australia have their only red-ball preparation ahead of the series on December 1, when they will play a three-day game among themselves.
