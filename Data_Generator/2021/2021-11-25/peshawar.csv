Opposition Leader in GB Assembly Amjad Hussain Advocate had tabled the resolution. He accused finance minister Javaid Manawa and chief minister’s adviser on law Syed Suhail Abbas of opposing the resolution.
The resolution said Khalsa Sarkar (state land) Rules 1978, which were applicable in all the districts of Gilgit-Baltistan, were against the Constitution of Pakistan and Islamic principles.
It said that GB people’s right to property was being usurped for many decades under the law enforced in 1979 by the federal ministry of Kashmir affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan.
This house terms Khalsa Sarkar (state land) Rules 1978 as unconstitutional, unlawful and against Islamic principles, and demands its repeal, the resolution demanded.
Speaking in the house, Amjad Hussain Advocate, who is from PPP, said that GB people’s rights to land had been usurped under the ‘black law’. He said influential people had been allotted thousands of acres of land in the region under the provision. Amjad Hussain appealed to the treasury members to vote in favour of the resolution.
Speaking about the resolution, CM’s adviser on law Sohail Abbas said the law was benefiting the land mafia. He suggested referring the resolution to the Land Reforms Commission.
PTI allied Majlis Wahadat-i-Muslimeen member Akbar Rajai also supported the resolution. Balawaristan National Front-Naji group member Nawaz Khan Naji warned any attempts to ‘grab’ land in GB would be resisted.
Finance minister Javed Ali Manawa also suggested referring the resolution to the Land Reform Commission before its passage from the assembly.

3,PPP demands SC suo motu notice of ex-CJP audio clip,Khursheed Shah asks Saqib Nisar to get clean chit from apex court,"PESHAWAR: Pakistan Peoples Party central leader Khursheed Shah has demanded of the Supreme Court to take a suo motu notice of the ‘leaked’ audio clip of former chief justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar regarding PML-N leaders Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz’s trial prior to the 2018 elections, and order an independent inquiry to ascertain its authenticity.
Addressing a news conference at the residence of former PPP provincial president Syed Zahir Ali Shah here on Wednesday, Mr Khursheed said his party had neither supported attempts to weaken national institutions nor would it do so in future.
He said if the former CJP didn’t move the apex court to defend himself on the matter, then the leaked audio clip would be considered to be true.

Khursheed Shah asks Saqib Nisar to get clean chit from apex court

Accompanied by central leader of the party Qamar Zaman Kaira, provincial president Najamuddin Khan, Women’s Wing provincial president Senator Rubina Khalid, Zahir Ali Shah, Mr Khursheed said the former CJP should get a clean chit from the Supreme Court on the matter.
He said the opposition parties were ‘completely’ united in parliament to resolve issues constitutionally.
The PPP leader said the opposition wanted to oust the government without delay but would never adopt undemocratic steps for the purpose.
He criticised the poor economic policies of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government and said the inflation and unemployment rates were increasing fast but the rulers weren’t bothered about the people’s misery caused by them.
Mr Khursheed said he expected no good from the ‘selected’ Prime Minister Imran Khan, who had made many U-turns on the promise to bring about a positive change in the people’s life.
He claimed that his party’s governments improved the people’s life, created jobs for them and took concrete steps to address inflation and poverty.
Meanwhile, PPP leader Qamar Zaman Kaira said his party advocated an in-house change but Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz leader Nawaz Sharif opposed the idea and suggested protests out of parliament.
He said had the PML-N agreed to the suggestion of a no-confidence motion against the ruling PTI in the Punjab Assembly, the people would have seen changes in the centre as well.
Mr Kaira said the PPP had parted ways with the opposition’s alliance of Pakistan Democratic Movement due to the ‘harsh attitude’ of PML-N leader Shahid Khaqan Abbasi.
He said the current serious financial crisis in the country threatened the federation.
“The rulers have failed to adopt any solid economic policy. Frequent increase in the prices of essential commodities is no solution to the country’s problems,” he said.
The PPP leader said the PTI government had ‘totally surrendered to mafias’.
He rejected the recent legislation for the use of electronic voting machines in elections and said the EVM idea was impracticable as highlighted by the Election Commission of Pakistan as well. Mr Kaira said the government adopted ‘wrong and undemocratic’ method for EVM legislation.
He said PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and other central leaders would address the party’s foundation day public meeting in Peshawar on Nov 30.
Meanwhile, the provincial PPP cabinet on Wednesday finalised arrangements for the Nov 30 public meeting and warned that if the workers’ access to the venue was blocked, the government would be responsible for any untoward incident.
The cabinet met here with provincial PPP president Najamuddin Khan in the chair and took approved measures to ensure the people’s participation in the public meeting in large numbers.

7,Body search of women by policemen illegal: Peshawar High Court,Court grants bail to woman in drug case.,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has declared that policemen are not allowed to conduct body search of a woman under any circumstances and that under the law, a woman could be subjected to body search by a woman only.
Justice Mussarat Hilali of a single-member bench observed that under the Code of Criminal Procedure, a woman was entitled to ‘special treatment’ regarding body search.
“Section 52 of the CrPC provides that whenever it is necessary to cause a woman to be searched, the search should be made by another woman with strict regard to decency.
“Under no circumstances, male police personnel shall actually touch the person of a woman for making search or arrest,” it ruled.

Court grants bail to woman in drug case

The bench made the order while accepting bail petition of a woman suspect,who was arrested by the officials of Pishtakhara police station on Sept 6, 2021, on the charge of narcotics smuggling.
It granted bail to the petitioner on condition of furnishing two surety bonds of Rs100,000 each.
The FIR of the case was registered under Section 9-D of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotics Substance Act.
The police had alleged that they had seen the petitioner stand on the roadside on the Ring Road in Peshawar with a shopping bag in her hand and that the search led to the seizure of 3,280 grammes of heroin in the bag.
The petitioner’s counsel, Umer Zafran, contended that his client was falsely implicated in the case. He stated that the petitioner was six weeks pregnant and was a mother of three children.
He said on record, there was no female constable with the police team which claimed of recovering contraband from her possession. He added that the petitioner was arrested on Peshawar’s Ring Road which was a busy public place without a female constable.
The bench observed when the petitioner was searched by police on public road in presence of all male police personnel, the norms of decency could not have been observed.
“The question is how the petitioner, who is pregnant of six weeks, was searched on road side where there no prior information of her being involved in trafficking narcotics,” it observed.
The bench also expressed concern about the policemen keeping that woman in their custody for three long hours.
“It has also been noticed with great concern that though the FIR was registered against the petitioner at 1650 hours but she was sent to Women Police Station at 1950 hours Ice after a delay of three hours during which she remained in exclusive male police custody as no female constable is shown to have been associated with the proceedings,” it observed.
The court added that the situation was extremely intolerable, undesirable and against the statutory and executive directions.
It observed that despite the lapse of 65 days, the prosecution had failed to produce the Forensic Science Laboratory report of the contraband allegedly recovered from the petitioner.

Speaking at a press conference in Peshawar Press Club the other day, Sarhad Petroleum and Cartage Dealers Association, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, chairman Abdul Majid Khan said the decision about the strike had been taken on the call of Pakistan Petroleum Dealers Association. 
He said the dealers were getting Rs3.91 and Rs2.74 profit on a litre of petrol and diesel, respectively. He said the average sale of a filling station was about 4,000 litres and they were unable to meet their expenditures in the prevailing circumstances. 
He said their expenditures had increased manifold due to the high prices of essential commodities, making it difficult for them to run the filling stations. 
Mr Majid said repeated increases in power tariff and salaries of their employees had jacked up the operational costs of filling stations. He said the dealers had presented their demands to the federal government to increase their profit margins to help them meet the increasing operational costs, but to no avail. 
He said that as per decision of the dealers all petrol pumps across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa would remain closed on Thursday (today), adding they had no other option except to go on strike as the government had failed to meet the Nov 17 deadline for acceptance of their main demand.

15,Dengue cases decline as temperature drops,Experts call for long-term strategy to control mosquito production,"PESHAWAR: Dengue cases are declining with the advent of winter season amid calls from experts to start immediate work with focus on water to reduce production of mosquitoes, the only transmitter of the vector-borne disease in the province.
The focus of long term intervention should be water, the first source of mosquito production, according to entomologists.
“We don’t have local dengue virus but imported it from other cities. It was communicated to people through bites of infected mosquitoes. There is not much credit to the government departments for declining cases of dengue because mosquitoes don’t survive in temperature below 15 Celsius,” they told this scribe.
The experts said that from November 12 to 17, the province reported over 100 dengue cases per day after which the incidence started decreasing owing to onset of cold weather.

Experts call for long-term strategy to control mosquito production

On Wednesday, 54 new dengue infections were recorded taking the province-wide toll of the cases to 10,223, a report of health department said.
So far, 10 persons including two each from Peshawar, Khyber and North Waziristan and one each from Swabi, Malakand, Haripur and Bannu have died of dengue in the province. 
The province has 189 active patients. Of the total infected persons, 10,024 patients including 60 recorded during the last 24 hours have recovered from the ailment. A total of 46 patients have been admitted to hospitals in the province.
Since March, health department has tested 65,306 suspected persons. Peshawar has reported 5,391 dengue cases, the highest number of infections recorded by any district in the province.
The health experts said that dengue fever started infecting people in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa after 2010 flash floods, which increased production of mosquitoes. Since then, the mosquitoes-born disease occurs every year. It killed 70 people in 2017 and 10 this year so far.
They said that health department had a role only in diagnostics and treatment of patients but other measures, such as provision of water and electricity and keeping the environment clean and free of stagnant water pools were the responsibilities of other departments.
So far, efforts by government to ensure close coordination among the line departments to reduce population of mosquitoes and resolve the problems of water and electricity of the people in the hard-it 20 dengue hotspots have failed to show the desired results. These areas are reporting 80 per cent cases in Peshawar, which is responsible for over 50 per cent incidence in the province.
“Lack of cooperation by people in the endemic areas is another problem as they don’t allow workers to carry out spray and check presence of larvae in water pots in their houses. 
“As a result, every year, we are waiting for hot season to go and get rid of dengue,” said the experts.
Doctors in the hospitals want other department to work in unison and eliminate cause of mosquitoes-breeding to reduce the incidence. 
“We have improved our management skills regarding dengue due to which the mortality from the disease this year was below 0.5 per cent,” they said.
There are five high-risk districts for dengue in the province including Peshawar, Haripur, Mansehra, Swabi and Mardan.
“Dengue is totally preventable, but cases are coming from every district in ones and twos,” said health officials. They said that they took steps for vector control in the province.
