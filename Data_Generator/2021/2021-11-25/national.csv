1,Customers swarm fuel outlets as dealers go on strike today,Indefinite closure over govt’s failure to raise profit margin to 6pc ...,"• Indefinite closure over govt’s failure to raise profit margin to 6pc 
• Ministry says PSO, Shell, Total to remain open 
LAHORE/KARACHI: The All Pakistan Petrol Pumps Dealers Association on Wednesday announced a nationwide strike and closure of fuel stations from Thursday (today) for an indefinite period over the government’s failure to increase the dealers’ profit margin to six per cent.  
Soon after the announcement, long queues of motorists were seen at petrol pumps in several cities. 
The association’s leaders, including its Punjab president Chaudhry Irfan Elahi, Lahore president Chaudhry Asif and information secretary Khwaja Atif, held a press conference at a local hotel. 
Mr Atif said the government did not honour the promise it had made three years ago to raise the dealers’ profit margin, adding that it had become difficult for them to run fuel stations due to the growing and unchecked inflation and increase in the prices of petroleum products. 
In 2014, he said, a Pakistan Institute of Development Economics report had suggested Rs4.25 per litre as the operating cost of a station and that the dealers should be given this amount as the operating price. However, the government was paying them Rs3.91 per litre and also deducting Rs0.65 per litre as withholding tax from these operating charges, he stated. 
Mr Atif further said the dealers had previously called a strike from November 5 but withdrew it after federal Energy Minister Hammad Azhar led a government team and held a meeting with them on November 3 and agreed to meet their demands. 
The government had agreed to a 6pc increase in the profit margin and sought time till November 17 over which they had withdrawn the strike call. However, Mr Atif said, seven days had passed since the deadline and the government had not fulfilled its promise at which the association was forced to close the stations for an indefinite period or till the acceptance of their demands. 
In a statement, the head of the association’s Bahawalpur chapter, Muhammad Yaseen, said no vehicles, except ambulances and Rescue 1122 vans, would be supplied fuel during the strike. 
A spokesperson for the petroleum ministry claimed that they had sent a summary to the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet to increase the profit margin of dealers and was waiting for its approval. He further said the federal cabinet would take a decision on the increase in profit margin within 10 days. 
“However, oil will be available at all PSO, Shell and Total stations in the country,” he said, adding that oil tankers had been sent to these stations to ensure supply to the public.
On the other hand, Energy Minister Hammad Azhar attempted to cool down the situation by tweeting that “we are in touch with petroleum dealers association. A summary regarding revision of their margins has already been tabled in the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) and a decision will be taken in its next session”. 
Following the strike announcement, consumers in many parts of the country were seen making a beeline at petrol pumps to top up their fuel tanks, while many stations had started closing down from the evening, causing severe hardships for vehicle owners. 
Pakistan Petroleum Dealers Association (PPDA) chairman Abdul Sami Khan at a press conference at Karachi Press Club on Wednesday also explained the government’s agreement to increase the margin on sales after the association called a strike on November 5. 
The petroleum ministry had called on the PPDA that was followed by more meetings, assuring the association’s members of taking them on board before sending a summary to the ECC on an upward margin revision. However, the government made no further contact. 
Sami Khan said that soon after announcing the strike on Wednesday, the government issued a notification that oil companies, which are running a few petrol pumps, have been advised to keep their stations open. 
He said that it was impossible to run petrol stations at the current margin of 3.25pc owing to the threefold hike in daily expenses as a result of high power rates and workers’ salaries, government departments’ fees and the yearly provincial and federal government taxes. He said the government had raised the margin six months ago by 20 paisa per litre. 
In a surprise move, the All Pakistan Petroleum Dealers Association, which had been at loggerheads with the PPDA over various issues, fully supported the strike call, asking their members to close down their pumps from 6am on Thursday.

Reforms will be carried out in 20 districts in five years  

Mr Bizenjo said that without education no country could be developed.  
“Schoolchildren are still sitting on sacks in Balochistan,” the chief minister lamented. “Teachers have developed the habit of remaining absent from schools and are not ready to serve in remote areas of the province.”

5,Media bodies urge  govts not to use adverts as control tool,"Pakistan Broadcasters Association says democracy and people ""suffer the most"" when govts try to control freedom of expression.","KARACHI: Government advertising should never be used to influence editorial content or to control free speech, said the Pakistan Broadcasters Association (PBA) and All Pakistan Newspapers Society (APNS) on Wednesday. 
In response to a statement made by PML-N Vice President Maryam Nawaz as well as Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry, the two bodies representing radio, television channels and newspapers said in their separate statements that governments should not try to create divisions within media industry or use advertising as a tool to exercise control over news organisations.

“We ask the government to make public all media spends of the last 20 years, including the present government’s spend,” PBA said. “PBA strongly condemns all forms of coercion by any government past or present that has used government advertisements as a tool to influence editorial policy. The present government also faces accusations of adopting the same strategy whereas as per its manifesto, it should ensure that taxpayers’ money for advertisement in public interest is well spent and is given on merit.” 
PBA said the present government had centralised the process under which decisions pertaining to advertisements are made, taking this right away from individual government organisations, departments and ministries, in order to exercise total control over media. 
“The present government’s track record on media relations has also come under a lot of criticism by media watchdogs and journalists’ bodies. When governments try to control freedom of expression, democracy and the people of Pakistan suffer the most,” it added.

Meanwhile, APNS also expressed its profound concern over the statement of Ms Nawaz and the subsequent statement of the information minister wherein he shared figures of advertisements released to media during the tenure of the previous government.
“The figures released are not only partial and selective but purposefully do not include the advertisement spend of the present government. The APNS asks the government to release the figures of advertising released to the media in the last 20 years,” said the APNS statement.
It said APNS always strongly condemned and resisted all acts and policies of the past and present governments which were intended to curb freedom of press and expression by using government advertising to influence editorial content.

6,PM Imran underlines mobile operators’ role in economic growth,Premier is informed that investments by Jazz in Pakistan crossed $10bn including $560m in last two years on 4G network expansion.,"ISLAMABAD: Mobile operators play a key role in the economic growth of any country by bringing in foreign investment, fostering connectivity, and enabling other sectors to thrive, Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Wednesday. 
“The government has launched the ‘Digital Pakistan’ initiative to provide a platform to the youth and it is heartening to see private sector companies like Jazz carry the mantle,” the prime minister said during a meeting with VEON Group CEO Kaan Terzioglu.
The Dutch telecom and internet service provider VEON operates in Pakistan through its subsidiary Jazz that has the largest number of 34.2 million 4G users in country and a total customer base of 71.9m.
The PM was informed that investments by Jazz in Pakistan has crossed $10 billion including $560m in the last two years on 4G network expansion.
Mr Terzioglu highlighted that the group is committed to initiatives in Pakistan that empower the youth with digital tools and resources. He reiterated VEON Group’s full support towards the government’s Digital Pakistan initiative and talked about the role Jazz is playing in improving digital infrastructure, enhancing connectivity, investing in digital skills and literacy, promoting entrepreneurship and innovation, and driving financial inclusion through JazzCash.
VEON, a leading global provider of connectivity and internet services, is embarking on a journey to be a world-leading digital operator with over 213.8 million subscribers in nine countries, he said. “Pakistan is a key market for VEON, and we see tremendous growth potential as the country continues to implement its ‘Digital Pakistan’ vision,” Mr Terzioglu added. 
To promote the Digital Pakistan vision and encourage private sector investment in broadband connectivity and network expansion, a forward-looking regulatory regime is needed that has to be in line with next-generation connectivity requirements, he urged. 
Meanwhile, Jazz CEO Aamir Ibrahim said that by utilising the leadership position and global expertise, Jazz is focused on creating a flourishing digital ecosystem in Pakistan, by constantly investing in expanding access to 4G to rural and semi-urban areas.

7,UNHCR to upgrade 43 schools for refugees next year in Balochistan,"It will also provide vocational training, education, health care facilities to refugees and involve them in economic activities.","QUETTA: The head of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Quetta, Erwin Policar, on Wednesday announced that his organisation had plans to upgrade 43 schools for Afghan refugees in the province next year. 
Speaking at an awareness session organised, he said that UNHCR would provide vocational training, education and health care facilities to refugees and involve these people in economic activities so that they could return to their homeland after becoming productive citizens. 
Mr Policar said that the United Nations wanted all countries to open their borders for Afghan refugees, adding that at present the number of registered Afghan refugees in Pakistan was 1.4 million. Of them, 333,000 are living in Balochistan. 
“The UNHCR has allocated $200 million for improving health, education and other facilities in Pakistan and 43 schools in the province will be upgraded, CT scan machines will be installed at Fatima Jinnah Hospital and ambulances will be provided in 9 districts to facilitate Afghan refugees,” he said. 
He said the UNHCR wanted the Pakistan government to keep shelters open for Afghans so that new refugees could be facilitated but so far the refugees’ influx had been less than what was expected.  
Dr Babrak Niaz of the Mass Communication Department of the Balochistan University said that precautionary element was very important in reporting about other communities including refugees in the province. 
He said that journalists should pay special attention to the code of conduct in this regard so that problems of Afghan refugees were highlighted in a better way and they should be considered respectable members of society.

8,PBC asks for inquiry commission to look into leaked clip,"Says commission should include a retired chief justice, a senior lawyer and a senior parliamentarian.","ISLAMABAD: Amid calls for an inquiry into the leaked audio clip purportedly of former chief justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar, the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC), a premier legal body, passed a resolution on Wednesday demanding an independent inquiry commission to investigate the matter. 
The inquiry commission should comprise a retired chief justice, a senior lawyer of great repute and a senior parliamentarian of impeccable character to inquire into recent allegations pertaining to audio and video recordings.  
The former chief justice, however, has denied that the voice in the clip was his. 
Signed by PBC Vice Chairman Khushdil Khan, the resolution regretted that the leaked audio clip of a conversation purportedly between Justice Saqib Nisar and an unidentified man regarding the conviction of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz has brought the independence of judiciary into question. 
The PBC said the commission to be constituted should formulate its recommendations for appropriate actions against the responsible person by fixing responsibility for the delinquency to ensure fundamental rights of the people and to restore the confidence of the masses in the judicial system of the country. 
On Tuesday, PML-N President and Leader of the Opposition Shehbaz Sharif had also asked the former chief justice to come clean adding that the audio clip showed how the former prime minister and his daughter had been targeted as part of the grand plot to keep them out of the political process. 
The PBC also expressed grave concern over the price hike of daily commodities and said the same had become out of the reach of the common man.  
The PBC said that increase in unemployment, worsening law and order situation and target killing of innocent people had become order of the day. 
The council expressed strong reservations over the passage of 33 bills in a single day by the federal government without consensus of the opposition, severe conditions of the IMF imposed upon the government in respect of getting loans and continuous de-valuation of the Pakistani rupee. 
The council also authorised the vice chairman of the PBC to convene a convention at Islamabad immediately and invite all stakeholders, including representatives of bar bodies, civil society, media persons and leaders of political parties to discuss all thorny issues being faced by the country. 
The PBC also took serious exception to visits by judicial officers to various schools on the orders of superior authorities and said it was beyond the dignity and status of a judge and the judiciary and was also violative of the fundamental rights of the citizens of Pakistan.  
The PBC demanded that this exercise should be brought to an end immediately.

Speaking at a webinar arranged by the Pakistan High Commission on ‘Student Direct Stream: Opportunities for Pakistani students in Canada’ on Tuesday, she said Islamabad is a better place for that to happen as it would help resolve a lot of the issues that we are facing not only with the student visas but also with temporary resident visas and business visas. 
Ms Khalid said she would continue to “make our efforts and ensure that there’s a fair process to encourage more students from Pakistan to come and educate themselves in Canada”. 
She said Canada relies on a healthy immigration due to its growing labour market and the Pakistani Canadians, especially the Pakistani students, have a lot to contribute to “this wonderful country”. 
She said that one of her focuses as a member of parliament over the past six years has been to increase people-to-people relationship between Pakistan and Canada, increase trade and exchanges in education, culture and heritage and ensure the Pakistani Canadians are well satisfied with the Canadian immigration system. 
She said that before the Liberal government took office in 2015, it used to take approximately four years for somebody from Pakistan to sponsor their spouse to come to Canada but now that time has been reduced to about 12 months.

10,RED ZONE FILES: Judging the judge,"Entanglement will at some point be disentangled, the knot will be un-knotted but till then the war will wage on its own momentum.","Maryam Nawaz Sharif is getting good at naming names. In fact, she may be making a habit of it, much to the discomfort of those being named. If in doubt, ask retired judge Saqib Nisar. 
On Wednesday, Maryam was on fire, but in an understated way. She didn’t raise her voice, but she raised the political and judicial temperature fairly high by putting the former chief justice in the dock. A reversal of roles if ever there was one, but one that was waiting to happen. A dam is bursting with allegations against a man who, ironically, spent much precious time, and judicial capital, fetishising a dam. That fetish may have been laid to rest, but the accusations of years past clearly have not. Saqib Nisar is now — metaphorically speaking — on the run. 
Editorial: With emergence of another leak, the superior judiciary can no longer remain on the fence
But can he actually outrun what may be coming his way? The toxic fallout of the crisis that erupted with the publication of the Panama Papers five years ago continues to drizzle down like acid rain. The judicialisation of politics, and vice versa, has led to strange institutional entanglements that are hard to unknot. Perhaps even impossible. After Maryam’s presser on Wednesday, Prime Minister Imran Khan delivered an impassioned speech at the Kamyab Jawan programme and reminded us of the two extremes that are today defining the parameters of Pakistan’s political discourse. After informing the audience about his success as a cricketer and a philanthropist, the PM rubbished the Saqib Nisar Leaks and explained that this was all part of the strategy by the Sharifs to hide their corruption. 
If it only were just that. 
Beyond the partisan warring and political wrestling, there is a grudging acknowledgement on all sides that the events of the last five years do not pass the smell test. Much has happened in all arenas in this period that may not stand the pressure of scrutiny. History will not be kind to many who shaped these events. But while we may have to wait for history’s verdict, other more pressing matters have already begun to take a toll on institutions, individuals and reputations. As is usual in such affairs, timing is key. 
Judge Saqib Nisar unfortunately is not in control of the timing. He may in fact become collateral damage in a fight that is increasing in ferocity with each passing day. In the end what he said in the audio leak, or what he did not say, will matter less than how his fall from grace fits into the larger pattern being painted across the political horizon. The judge, it appears now, may be judged in a court where evidence is what you believe it is. When public opinion turns judge, jury and executioner, it shows little mercy. 
Read more: Will Saqib Nisar's alleged leaked audio have any legal repercussions?
More so when such opinion is used as high octane fuel for scorching up a new political path. Increasingly within the Red Zone there is hushed talk of events overtaking predictions in the next few months. In fact, the mention of the next months is circulating with greater zest from both sides of the aisle. The opposition is increasingly confident that Saqib Nisar’s dam is not the only one that has started leaking. 
But there is a difference between a leak and a rupture. The smarter ones within the PDM appreciate the difference, and don’t want it proven at their expense. This explains why the alliance meets and meets and can’t really make up its mind what to do next. It smells an opportunity, and feels an opportunity, but it cannot reach out and touch the opportunity. What if it’s nothing more than smoke and mirrors? The fear lurks deep within the dark crevices of the alliance’s neuro-space. Once bitten twice shy, thrice bitten….
And yet — yet again, there is this temptation to reach out for the forbidden fruit, to bet it all on the roulette wheel in a final flourish, to throw in all chips on the hand that may not hold all aces — ah, there’s this desperate gambler’s instinct that comes into play when you have nothing more to lose, except everything. 
Between now and the late arrival of spring next year is where the game is, or at least that’s the word on the carpeted street inside the Red Zone. Beyond that, all bets are off. The interplay between the ruling coalition, the opposition coalition and the institutional coalition will begin to sway to a predictable rhythm if a certain calendar milestone is passed. The logic of the Red Zone can be breathtakingly simple in its complexity. 
And so it all filters down to this: Can Imran Khan notify a powerful appointment next year before opposition’s moves can lead to him being de-notified? It is a battle of wits because the deck has been reshuffled and the best laid plans may yet have a shelf life. 
This segues into the changing nature of the battle wherein people like Saqib Nisar — once strategic players — are being traded like mere pawns in a blood-soaked campaign that has become much larger than him, his ambitions, and definitely his legacy. The judge is in a cold, harsh and perhaps lonely place. 
According to insiders, for now, however, the path ahead is uncertain and fraught with danger. The PDM may look confident but it is not, the government may look secure but it is not, and the establishment may look clear, but it is not. It’s a political traffic jam on D-Chowk and no traffic police in sight. All drivers are honking, and cursing and refusing to reverse their way out of the mess. We have been down this road before, and it ain’t been pretty.  December promises to clear things. Except, not really. The entanglement will at some point be disentangled, and the knot will at some point be un-knotted, but till then the war will wage on its own momentum, and combatants will be felled by their own swords, and the leaders will rise and fall with their own choices — for such is the outcome of epic conflicts that have no heroes and no villains.
