0,Centre-left union seals deal to lead Germany in post-Merkel era,Current finance minister says his incoming govt will set up a crisis team to fight pandemic.,"BERLIN: A centre-left-led alliance of parties on Wednesday announced a deal to form Germany’s new government, with rising coronavirus infections posing an immediate crisis for the post-Angela Merkel cabinet to put out.
Two months after the Social Democrats (SPD) beat Merkel’s conservative CDU-CSU bloc in a general election, they concluded a roadmap on plans for Germany’s next four years with the Greens and liberal Free Democrats that will install Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, 63, as chancellor.
The relatively rapid accord is likely to be greeted with relief by international partners wary of a hamstrung Germany while crises from the global Covid emergency to Belarus and a weak economic recovery rage.
Within Germany, voices have grown louder for the new coalition to take swift action to curb a surging fourth wave of the pandemic as hospital beds fill up and new infections soar to record highs day after day.
In a sign of the emergency, Merkel, who is retiring from politics after four terms, summoned the leaders of the new coalition parties for talks over the rapidly deteriorating Covid situation midway during their last spurt of negotiations on Tuesday.
Scholz said his incoming government will set up a crisis team to fight the pandemic, and pledged to spend a billion euros ($1.12 billion) on bonuses for health workers in hospitals and care homes who have been on the frontlines of the crisis.
He voiced backing for compulsory vaccinations for health staff and said his government will “do everything necessary to bring our country safely through this time.”
Besides the pandemic, the three parties’ coalition contract presented on Wednesday covers the main policy outlines for their term in government.
It includes a plan to bring Germany’s exit out of coal forward to 2030 from 2038, a pledge to reinstate the country’s constitutionally enshrined debt limit for 2023, as well as a proposal to legalise recreational use of cannabis.
A thorny part of coalition-building negotiations — which party takes which ministry — was also settled.
With the business-friendly FDP to run the powerful finance ministry, the leader of the party Christian Lindner is poised to take charge of Europe’s biggest economy’s finances.
A new “super-ministry” grouping the portfolios of economy, climate protection and energy and the foreign ministry go to the Greens, with Robert Habeck, the ecologists’ co-leader, expected to take the environmental portfolio.
Annalena Baerbock, the Greens’ other leader, is poised to become Germany’s next foreign minister -- the first woman in the job. The line-up hints at a Germany that could take a more assertive tone towards China and Russia, while economically it will stick to budgetary rigour and aggressively push green investments.
The swift pace at which the three parties — known in Germany as the Ampel or “traffic-light” after their colours — came together to defy expectations as the FDP is not seen as a natural partner of the centre-left SPD or Greens.
But the parties were anxious to avoid a repeat of the messy negotiations four years ago, when Lindner was vilified for pulling the plug on talks with Merkel’s CDU-CSU and the Greens.
The 177-page coalition contract will now be put to the parties’ rank-and-file, which are expected to rubberstamp them, following which Scholz will be elected formally by MPs in the Bundestag, likely in early December.

1,Ethiopian PM reaches front line to fight rebels,ADDIS ABABA: Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has arrived at the front line where government forces are battling...,"ADDIS ABABA: Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has arrived at the front line where government forces are battling rebels from the northernmost Tigray region, state-affiliated media said on Wednesday.
International alarm has mounted over the escalating year-long conflict, prompting foreign governments to tell their citizens to leave amid fears the Tigrayan rebels could march on the capital Addis Ababa.
Abiy, winner of the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize, “is now leading the counter-offensive” and “has been giving leadership from the battlefield as of yesterday,” Fana Broadcasting Corporate reported.
Deputy Prime Minister Demeke Mekonnen is handling “regular activities”, the report said.
It was not clear where exactly Abiy, a former radio operator in the military who rose to lieutenant-colonel, had deployed, and state media did not broadcast images of him in the field. Officials have not responded to requests for details about his mission and whereabouts.
The fighting in the north of Africa’s second most populous country has killed thousands of people and forced hundreds of thousands into famine-like conditions, according to UN estimates. Foreign envoys have been frantically pushing for a ceasefire, though there have been few signs a breakthrough is coming.
Jeffrey Feltman, Washington’s special envoy for the Horn of Africa, said on Tuesday that “nascent progress” risked being “outpaced by the military escalation by the two sides”.
The war erupted in November 2020 when Abiy sent troops into Tigray to topple its ruling party, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF).
He said the move was in response to TPLF attacks on federal army camps and promised a swift victory, but by late June the rebels had retaken most of Tigray including its capital Mekele.
Since then the TPLF has pushed into neighbouring Amhara and Afar regions, and this week it claimed to have seized a town just 220 kilometres from the capital.
Abiy’s announcement that he would deploy to the front “has inspired many to... join the survival campaign”, Fana said.
On Wednesday hundreds of new recruits took part in a ceremony held in their honour in the Kolfe district of Addis Ababa. As officials corralled sheep and oxen into trucks bound for the north, the recruits broke into patriotic songs and chants.
“I was amazed when I heard” Abiy planned to join soldiers in the field, one of the recruits, 42-year-old driver Tesfaye Sherefa, said.
“When a leader leaves his chair... and his throne it is to rescue his country. His focus is not to live, but to rescue this country, and I sobbed when he said follow me and went to the front line.” Among those saying they would fight is Feyisa Lilesa, a distance runner and Olympic silver medallist, who told state media the rebels’ advance presented “a great opportunity” to defend the country.
“When a country is violated, there is no way I will stand by and just watch,” Feyisa said.
The marathon runner gained political prominence by raising and crossing his arms as he finished the marathon at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro — a gesture of solidarity with fellow ethnic Oromos killed while protesting abuses committed during nearly three decades of TPLF rule.

2,Breastfeeding British MP contests baby ban in Commons,LONDON: A British MP won a promise of parliamentary reforms on Wednesday after she was rebuked by an official for...,"LONDON: A British MP won a promise of parliamentary reforms on Wednesday after she was rebuked by an official for bringing her sleeping baby to a debate.
Stella Creasy, an opposition Labour lawmaker who has campaigned for MPs to be offered full maternity cover, received the warning after speaking at a debate on Tuesday while holding her three-month-old son Pip.
The London MP tweeted an email from an official at the House of Commons citing a rule that “you should not take your seat in the chamber when accompanied by a child”.
“Mothers in the mother of all parliaments are not to be seen or heard it seems,” Creasy complained.
Her treatment prompted anger from MPs on all sides and promises of a review of the current rules, which officials admitted had been applied inconsistently.
The Speaker of the House of Commons, Lindsay Hoyle, told MPs that he had not known of the official’s rebuke.
But he stressed: “It is extremely important that parents of babies and young children are able to participate fully in the work of this House.” Creasy said she was “pleased to hear this”.
Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose wife Carrie is expecting their second child, backs reforms but the decision is up to the House of Commons, according to his official spokesman.
“We want the workplace in any circumstances to be modern and flexible and fit for the 21st century,” the spokesman said. Justice Secretary Dominic Raab, who also has young children, expressed support for Creasy.
“Quite what the right balance is in terms of the chamber, let me leave that to the House authorities, but frankly I’ve got a lot of sympathy for Stella Creasy,” he told BBC television.
“I think we do need to make sure our profession is brought into the modern world, the 21st century, and can allow parents to juggle the jobs they do with the family time that they need.”
Despite the formal ban, MPs have previously brought babies to debates without reprimand. Former Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson was the first to do so in 2018.
Alex Davies-Jones, a Labour MP, tweeted that when elected in 2019 she was breastfeeding and Hoyle assured her she would be able to feed her baby in the House of Commons itself or Westminster Hall, an adjacent historic building that is used for less significant debates. Creasy is still breastfeeding Pip, and had previously brought her baby daughter to parliament.
“He’s very tiny” and “perhaps some of my colleagues are noisier than him”, she told Sky News, calling for a more flexible approach from parliamentary authorities.
“It’s a part and parcel of modern life, isn’t it, that sometimes you might need to have your children with you.” Creasy has campaigned unsuccessfully for MPs to get full rights to maternity cover. “When you’re a mum you can’t win,” she added.
The government in February introduced six-month formal paid maternity leave for senior ministers. Attorney-General Suella Braverman was the first cabinet member to benefit from the new law.
But the rules for backbench MPs are different. Creasy in 2019 became the first MP to hire a locum to work on her behalf after her daughter’s birth, but was not allowed to do this again for Pip.

3,Sweden’s first woman PM resigns hours after election,"“I don’t want to lead a government whose legitimacy will be questioned,” she says.","STOCKHOLM: Sweden’s Prime Minister-elect Magdalena Andersson on Wednesday handed in her resignation hours after being appointed by parliament, after her budget failed to pass and the junior Green Party quit the coalition government.
While her stint was unexpectedly brief, Andersson made history by becoming the first woman elected to the post of prime minister in Sweden — she was to formally take over on Friday.
The 54-year-old economist who has served as finance minister for the past seven years said she hoped to be elected to the position again soon as the head of a minority government made up of only the Social Democrats.
“There is a constitutional practice that a coalition government should resign when one party quits,” Andersson, a Social Democrat, told reporters.
“I don’t want to lead a government whose legitimacy will be questioned.” Just hours earlier, parliament had elected Andersson after she clinched a last-minute deal with the Left Party to raise pensions in exchange for its crucial backing in Wednesday’s vote in parliament.
But the small Centre Party then withdrew its support for Andersson’s budget, due to the concessions made to the Left, leaving her budget with insufficient votes to pass in parliament.
Lawmakers instead adopted an alternative budget presented by the opposition conservative Moderates, Christian Democrats and far-right Sweden Democrats.
Andersson grudgingly said she would still be able to govern with that budget.
But in an even heavier and surprise blow, Greens leader Per Bolund said his party could not tolerate the opposition’s “historic budget, drafted for the first time with the far-right”, and quit the government.
Among other things, it could not accept the opposition’s planned tax cut on petrol, which it said would lead to higher emissions.
Speaker of parliament Andreas Norlen said he had accepted Andersson’s resignation and would contact party leaders before deciding Thursday how to proceed.
Sweden’s largest daily Dagens Nyheter said in an editorial that the turn of events could end up beneficial for Andersson, whom the Greens have vowed to support in a new prime ministerial vote.
“The Social Democrats can have all the cabinet posts and avoid all the compromises with the Greens,” it noted.
Despite being a nation that has long championed gender equality, Sweden has never before had a woman as prime minister.
After her election, Andersson called it “a special day”, coming 100 years after the Scandinavian country allowed female suffrage.

JOHANNESBURG: Anti-apartheid legend Nelson Mandela liked hearty, simple meals, like oxtail stew. It was a favourite dish of South Africa’s first black president and now fills ravioli served in his former home, which has been transformed into a boutique hotel.
The inside of the building, hidden on a quiet street in a wealthy suburb of Johannesburg, had been defaced by squatters.
But after a floor-to-ceiling remodel, now sunlight floods in from generous skylights and bay windows. The white facade is all that remains of the original building.
Mandela lived there for eight years before moving to another home around the corner with his third wife Graca Machel. He arrived shortly after his release from prison in 1990, and promptly set about meeting the neighbours, general manager Dimitri Maritz said.
“He went knocking on every door, to introduce himself and invite neighbours for canapes and cocktails,” Maritz said.
“A Chinese man shooed him away. When he realised he had shut the door in Mandela’s face, it is said that he moved not long after that,” Maritz laughed, while noting the tale’s whiff of urban legend.
The hotel, named Sanctuary Mandela, opened in September for guests seeking to bask in the ex-president’s calm and positive energy.
The presidential suite was once actually the president’s bedroom, though the heads of guests do not rest where his did. After the remodel, the bathroom is now where his bed once stood.
The window frames bear his nickname “Madiba” and his Robben Island prison number “466/64” — scratched into the wood by his grandson.
After Mandela’s release at age 71, he yearned for the simple pleasures he had been denied during 27 years in prison: playtime with his grandchildren, the scent of a rose, a sip of his favourite sweet Constantia wine.

5,27 migrants drown in boat tragedy between France and UK,CALAIS: At least 27 migrants died on Wednesday crossing from France to England when their boat sank off the port of...,"

CALAIS: At least 27 migrants died on Wednesday crossing from France to England when their boat sank off the port of Calais, French authorities said, the deadliest disaster since the sea route began to be widely used in 2018.
The French interior ministry said in a statement that patrol vessels found corpses and people unconscious in the water after a fisherman sounded the alarm.
French police then said that 27 people had died after setting out from Dunkirk east of Calais in a boat with some 50 people on board.
Three helicopters and three boats took take part in the search, local authorities said. French prosecutors have opened a manslaughter probe while British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to hold a crisis meeting.
French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin, who is heading to the scene, wrote on Twitter that “many people” had died in the incident, adding that “the criminal nature of the smugglers who organise these crossings cannot be condemned enough”.
“The disaster in the Channel is a tragedy,” Prime Minister Jean Castex tweeted.
“My thoughts are with the many missing and injured, victims of criminal smugglers who exploit their distress and misery.” The disaster, the worst single loss of life since at least 2018 when migrant began using boats en masse to cross the Channel, comes as tensions grow between London and Paris over the record numbers of people crossing.
Britain has urged tougher action from France to stop migrants from making the voyage.
Pierre Roques, coordinator of the Auberge des Migrants NGO in Calais, said the Channel risked becoming as deadly for migrants as the Mediterranean which has seen a much heavier toll over the last years of migrants crossing.
“People are dying in the Channel, which is becoming a cemetery. And as England is right opposite, people will continue to cross.” According to the French authorities, 31,500 people attempted to leave for Britain since the start of the year and 7,800 people have been rescued at sea, figures which doubled since August. Seven people have been confirmed dead or are still missing feared drowned after various incidents this year.
In Britain, Johnson’s government is coming under intense pressure, including from its own supporters, to reduce the numbers crossing. French police said this week they detained 15 suspected members of an international migrant smuggling syndicate that helped people illegally cross the Channel to Britain.
The network of Iraqi Kurds, Romanians, Pakistanis and Vietnamese helped at least 250 people each month cross to England, taking 60 migrants at a time in small boats. Passage to England would cost a migrant 6,000 euros ($6,800) and the smugglers racked up some 3 million euros ($3.4 million) in total profits, said the police.

6,"Biden omits China, Russia from democracy summit, angers both powers","BEIJING: China and Russia reacted furiously on Wednesday to US President Joe Biden’s planned democracy summit,...","BEIJING: China and Russia reacted furiously on Wednesday to US President Joe Biden’s planned democracy summit, which will exclude them, with Beijing angered over an invitation for Taiwan and the Kremlin branding it divisive.
The global conference was a campaign pledge by the US president, who has placed the struggle between democracies and “autocratic governments” at the heart of his foreign policy.
The inclusion of Taiwan, and not China, led to an angry rebuke from Beijing, which said it “firmly opposes” the invitation to “the so-called Summit for Democracy.” Beijing claims self-ruled Taiwan as part of its territory to be retaken one day, by force if necessary.
Around 110 countries have been invited to the virtual summit, including the United States’ major Western allies but also Iraq, India and Pakistan.
But Russia said the guest list, released on Tuesday on the State Department website, showed that the United States “prefers to create new dividing lines, to divide countries into those that — in their opinion — are good, and those that are bad.” “More and more countries prefer to decide themselves how to live,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, adding that Washington is “trying to privatise the term ‘democracy’.” “That can’t do so and should not do so,” he said.
Diplomatic coup
The invitation is a major coup for Taipei at a time when China is ramping up its campaign to keep Taiwan locked out of international bodies. Taiwan said the gathering would be a rare opportunity to burnish its credentials on the world stage.
“Through this summit, Taiwan can share its democratic success story,” presidential office spokesman Xavier Chang told reporters.
Only 15 countries officially recognise Taipei over Beijing, although many nations maintain de facto diplomatic relations with the island.
The US does not recognise Taiwan as an independent country but maintains it as a crucial regional ally and opposes any change to its status by force.
China baulks at any use of the word “Taiwan” or diplomatic gestures that might lend a sense of international legitimacy to the island.
“I agree Taiwan more than qualifies — but it does seem to be (the) only democratic govt invited that the US govt does not officially recognise. So its inclusion is a big deal,” tweeted Julian Ku, a Hofstra University law professor whose specialties include China.
Taiwan’s foreign ministry said it would be represented at the summit by its de facto US ambassador Bi-khim Hsiao and digital minister Audrey Tang, who is one of the world’s few openly transgender national politicians.
Scrutinised guest list
The long-advertised meeting will take place online on Dec 9 and 10 ahead of an in-person meeting at its second edition next year.
India, often called “the world’s biggest democracy”, will be present, despite increasing criticism from human rights defenders over democratic backsliding under Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
So too will Pakistan, despite its chequered relationship with Washington.
Turkey, a Nato ally of the United States whose President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was dubbed an “autocrat” by Biden, did not make the list.
Neither did the city-state of Singapore, or Bangladesh, one of the world’s most populous democracies.
In the Middle East, only Israel and Iraq were invited. The traditional Arab allies of the US — Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates — are all absent.
Biden also invited Brazil, which is led by controversial far-right President Jair Bolsonaro.
In Europe, Poland is represented, despite recurring tensions with Brussels over respect for the rule of law, but Hungary’s far-right Prime Minister Viktor Orban is not.
On the African side, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria and Niger are invited.
‘Decline of democracy’
“For this kick-off Summit... there’s a case for getting a broad set of actors into the room: it provides for a better exchange of ideas than setting a perfect bar for qualification,” Laleh Ispahani of the Open Society Foundations said.
Rather than using the summit as an anti-China meeting, Ispahani urged Biden to address “the serious decline of democracy around the world -- including relatively robust models like the US.” This summit is being organised as democracy has suffered setbacks in countries where the US had placed great hopes.
Sudan and Myanmar have experienced military coups, Ethiopia is in the midst of a conflict that could lead to its “implosion,” according to US diplomats, and the Taliban took power in Afghanistan following the withdrawal of US troops after two decades.

7,US puts Chinese firms helping military on trade blacklist,Several entities and individuals from China and Pakistan added to Commerce Department’s Entity List.,"WASHINGTON: The US government put a dozen Chinese companies on its trade blacklist on Wednesday for national security and foreign policy concerns, citing in some cases their help developing the Chinese military’s quantum computing efforts.
The department also said several entities and individuals from China and Pakistan were added to the Commerce Department’s Entity List for contributing to Pakistan’s nuclear activities or ballistic missile programme.
The latest US action on Chinese companies comes amid growing tensions between Beijing and Washington over the status of Taiwan and trade issues.
In total, 27 new entities were added to the list from China, Japan, Pakistan, and Singapore. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in a statement that the new listings will help prevent US technology from supporting the development of Chinese and Russian “military advancement and activities of non-proliferation concern like Pakistan’s unsafeguarded nuclear activities or ballistic missile program”. China’s embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Commerce Department said Hangzhou Zhongke Microelectronics Co Ltd, Hunan Goke Microelectronics , New H3C Semiconductor Technologies Co Ltd, Xi’an Aerospace Huaxun Technology and Yunchip Microelectronics were placed on the Commerce Department’s entity list for their “support of the military modernisation of the People’s Liberation Army”. It also added Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, QuantumCTek and Shanghai QuantumCTeck Co Ltd to the list for “acquiring and attempting to acquire US-origin items in support of military applications”.
The eight Chinese firms were listed to prevent US technology being used to help China develop quantum computing applications for its military.
The Commerce Department wants to stop the Chinese military from developing its counter-stealth technology, which could include equipment like advanced radars, and counter-submarine applications such as undersea sensors. The action also blocks US material from being used to help China break encryption or develop unbreakable encryption, the Commerce Department said.
Suppliers to companies on the entity list will need to apply for a licence before they can sell to them, which is likely to be denied.
Separately, the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology was added to the Commerce Department’s military end user list, but the listing did not provide additional information other than it had produced military products.

8,Wedding music blamed for death of 63 chickens in India,Police did not initiate any action after the poultry farmer withdrew his complaint.,"BHUBANESWAR: A traditional Indian wedding procession with pumping music, fireworks, dancing and a marching brass band in shiny jackets has been blamed for the death of 63 chickens.
Ranjit Kumar Parida said the party was blasting out “ear-splitting noise” as it passed his poultry farm in the eastern state of Odisha shortly before midnight on Sunday.
“I asked the band operators to lower the volume as the music was too noisy and terrifying the chickens. But they did not listen and the groom’s friends shouted at me,” Parida said.
A vet told Parida the chickens had died of a heart attack, and he filed a police complaint after the wedding organisers refused to pay compensation.
Zoology professor Suryakanta Mishra, who has authored a book on animal behaviour, told the Hindustan Times that loud noise increases the risk of cardiovascular disease in birds.
“Chickens are governed by a circadian rhythm that is controlled by the natural light/dark cycle of day and night.
“Sudden excitement or stress due to loud music could disrupt their biological clock,” Mishra said.
The story had a happy ending — except for the chickens — after police convinced the warring parties to “solve the matter mutually”.
“We have not initiated any action as (the poultry farmer) withdrew the complaint,” police official Droupadi Das said.

9,"Island housing Rohingya refugees faces ‘serious problems’, says ICRC","Since last December, Bangladesh has moved about 19,000 Rohingya refugees to the island.","DHAKA: A senior Red Cross official warned that “serious problems” remain with a remote island off southern Bangladesh housing Rohingya refugees, as officials prepared to ship thousands more people there this week.
Since last December, Bangladesh has moved about 19,000 Rohingya refugees, members of a persecuted mostly Muslim minority from Myanmar, to the island of Bhasan Char from mainland border camps.
Rights groups have likened it to an island jail and said some relocations were involuntary.
Alexander Matheou, Asia-Pacific director for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said restrictions on free movement and a shortage of job opportunities and healthcare would “deter people from choosing to go in large numbers” to the island, several hours’ from the mainland.
Matheou, who visited on Tuesday, said the site was “well-designed and organized in terms of housing” and had access to clean water, but the health services were “too basic to cope with a large population” and there was no established system of referrals to the mainland.
He said the main issue among refugees he spoke to was that they could not move back and forth to the mainland to see their families.
“While that’s difficult, that is really, really upsetting people,” he said. “So those issues could all act as a deterrent for people to voluntarily coming... I think that those will sort of undermine the success of the project unless they’re addressed.” He said authorities, who plan to move another 81,000 refugees to the island, were exploring allowing people to travel to the mainland for limited periods.

10,UAE holds talks with Taliban to run Kabul airport,Qataris have been helping run Hamid Karzai International Airport along with Turkey.,"DUBAI: The United Arab Emirates has held talks with the Taliban to run Kabul airport, going up against Gulf rival Qatar in a diplomatic tussle for influence with Afghanistan’s new rulers, according to four sources with knowledge of the matter.
UAE officials have held a series of discussions with the group in recent weeks to discuss operating the airport that serves as landlocked Afghanistan’s main air link to the world, the foreign diplomats based in the Gulf region said.
The talks demonstrate how countries are seeking to assert their influence in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan even as the hardline Islamist group largely remains an international pariah and its government not formally recognised by any country.
The Emiratis are keen to counter diplomatic clout enjoyed there by Qatar, according to the sources who declined to be name due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The Qataris have been helping run the Hamid Karzai International Airport along with Turkey after playing a major role in evacuation efforts following the chaotic US withdrawal in August, and have said they are willing to take over the operations.
Yet the Taliban has not yet formalised an arrangement with Qatar, the four diplomats said.
A senior Emirati foreign ministry official said the UAE, which previously ran Kabul airport during the US-backed Afghan republic, “remains committed to continuing to assist in operating” it to ensure humanitarian access and safe passage. Abu Dhabi also aided recent evacuation efforts.
The Taliban and Qatari authorities did not respond to requests for comment.
Two of the diplomats said the Taliban has also sought financial assistance from the UAE, though they added it was not clear if this was related to the airport discussions.
The Emirati foreign ministry official, Salem Al Zaabi, director of international security cooperation, did not respond to a question on whether the UAE was considering providing financial help to the Taliban.
One key issue that’s still to be resolved between the Taliban and potential airport operators is who would provide security at the site, the four diplomats said. The Taliban say they do not want foreign forces in the country following their return to power after two decades of war.
Still, Qatari special forces are presently providing security within the airport’s perimeter, the diplomats added, while Taliban special forces were patrolling areas outside.
So far countries have been reluctant to formally recognise the Taliban’s government, accusing the group of backtracking on pledges to uphold the rights of women and minorities.
Yet Qatari officials have urged greater international engagement with the Taliban to prevent impoverished Afghanistan from falling into a humanitarian crisis. Gulf states have also voiced concern that the US withdrawal would allow Al Qaeda to regain a foothold in Afghanistan.
While there is little commercial benefit for any operator, the airport would provide a much-needed source of intelligence on movements in and out of the country, according to the four diplomats, who said that since the withdrawal many countries have lacked real-time information.
Qatar and the UAE have had strained relations for years as they competed for regional influence. The UAE, Saudi Arabia and their allies boycotted Qatar for over three years, cutting off political, trade and transport ties, accusing Doha of supporting terrorism — a charge that it denies. The dispute was resolved in January this year.
Qatar has long been the gateway to the Taliban, with Doha hosting the group’s political office since 2013 and negotiations with the US in early 2020 that led to the withdrawal.
Last week, Qatari officials strengthened their position by signing an accord to represent American diplomatic interests in Afghanistan.
The UAE has maintained ties with the Taliban too, according to two of the diplomats. They said the country had been home to some members of the group in recent years, including Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, who they added lived in the Sharjah emirate with his family from at least 2013. Stanikzai is now deputy foreign minister in the Taliban administration.
Al Zaabi did not respond to questions on the UAE’s relationship with Stanikzai. The Taliban did not immediately respond to queries on Stanikzai living in the UAE.
The Taliban said this month that the UAE had reopened its embassy in Kabul. The UAE has not commented.
