0,Former judge Shaukat Aziz terms CJP’s speech ray of hope,Says his appeal against his dismissal has now turned into a “test case to gauge the judiciary’s independence”.,"ISLAMABAD: Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui, a former outspoken judge of the Islamabad High Court who was sacked three years ago after making an incendiary speech against officers of the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI), seems to have decided to test the recent assurances given by Chief Justice of Pakistan Gulzar Ahmed that the “judiciary never takes dictation”.
In a two-page application submitted before the Supreme Court on Wednesday, the former judge stated the recent address by the CJP gave a ray of hope to him that “other factors won’t be relevant any more in the instant matter (appeal against his sacking), which is pending since Oct 2018”.
Shaukat Aziz was referring to a speech by the CJP at the Asma Jahangir Conference in Lahore on Saturday in which he had rubbished allegations that any state institution had ever pressed the judiciary into giving verdicts of its choosing.
In his application, the former judge said his appeal against dismissal had now turned into a “test case to gauge the judiciary’s independence”.

Seeks early hearing of his appeal

His appeal against the Supreme Judicial Council’s (SJC) opinion and an Oct 11, 2018, notification, under which he was removed, is still pending before the Supreme Court.
His affidavit, which was read out during the hearing by the five-judge Supreme Court bench by his counsel Hamid Khan, was returned by the court office. The affidavit spoke of the former judge’s meetings with senior intelligence officers.
The federal government repudiated the affidavit on June 10, describing as misleading and baseless his claims about meetings with Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, the former director general of ISI.
In his July 21, 2018, speech at Rawalpindi’s District Bar Association, Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui had even accused certain “institutions of the state”, especially the ISI, of manipulating the composition of benches in the Islamabad High Court.
The application submitted by the former judge on Wednesday is part of a series of petitions in which he has repeatedly sought an early hearing of his case.
The fresh application, filed under rule 6 of the Supreme Court Rules of 1980, recalled that on June 11 this year,   a five-judge bench had observed that the matter be re-listed upon availability of the bench before the end of that month, but no hearing had taken place as yet.
Shaukat Siddiqui stated that numerous applications for an early hearing were filed on his behalf while he had also written a letter on Aug 5 to inform the court that a prolonged pendency of the matter was causing hardship to him and his family.
The Supreme Court office proposed three different dates —  Oct 12, Nov 3 and Nov 25 — for the hearing, but for “some unknown reasons” on all three occasions, the hearing was cancelled just days before the proposed dates, the letter recalled.
“The issue at hand is of great public importance since significant questions in relation to the independence of the judiciary, the rule of law and the supremacy of the Constitution had been raised in the appeal,” the application said.
Since a number of legal, fundamental and constitutional rights were involved in the case, the application highlighted, the petitioner was seeking indulgence of the apex court for an early fixation, preferably before Dec 1, of the case in the interest of justice.

1,"Callers asking Garrett Discovery to change report, says CEO","Firm receives 2,000 inquiries about its work on the audio clip of a conversation allegedly involving former CJP Saqib Nisar.","WASHINGTON: “We are technical people in the US, and we have nothing to do with the politics of Pakistan,” says Andrew Garrett, the CEO of the company that examined an audio clip of an alleged conversation between former chief justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar and an unidentified caller. 
Mr Garrett heads Garrett Discovery, a Florida-based company that conducts forensics on mobile, audio and video clips. Talking to Dawn on Wednesday afternoon, Mr Garrett said his firm has already received some 2,000 inquiries about the work it did on the audio clip for a news site called FactFocus. 
“Majority of the callers asked us to change our report. Some of the calls have been threats, not of violence but pseudo threats,” he added. “Like, we cannot wait till they hang you. We will sue you.”

Mr Garrett said he was not taking those threats very seriously because “we are in a secured building in the US” and “most of them were trying to get us to retract our report or trick us into saying something that they can use”. 

Firm receives 2,000 inquiries about its work on ex-CJP’s audio clip 

He said he headed a US-based company that could not be sued in Pakistan and “the person who gave us the data to analyse is responsible.” 
Asked if he was aware of the political repercussions of the work his company did, Mr Garrett said: “When we did this work, we did not know who these people were. We still do not know much about Pakistani politics.” 
He said the tape was given to the company for a specific purpose and the company had “no reason to believe it’s not real unless proven otherwise”. 
The person who gave them the tape asked them to determine if “the audio file has been manipulated, spliced or changed” and the company authenticated that the audio clip “has not been tampered with”. “But we did not indicate who the speaker was because we did not know.” 
Explaining how they examine a clip, he said: “If you bring me a file, I cannot tell you who the speaker actually is. I would have to have sample reference files, a bunch of them. We did not do that. All we said was that the audio file given to us had not been tampered with.” 
Those who conducted the forensic did not confirm or deny the authenticity of the file itself, he said. “We could not because we did not work on it.” 
Some reports in the Pakistani media claimed that if a forensic expert was given a second copy of a recording, he or she would have no way to know if the original was authentic or inauthentic. 
Mr Garrett also touched on this point, saying: “If you record something, then use another device to record it again, the second recording will look authentic.” But he warned that this statement should not be taken as an authentication or rejection of the clip they worked on. “I am not saying that it happened. The credibility is on the reporter who has it, wherever they got that file from I have no idea.” 
Addressing those who were threatening the company, Mr Garrett said their “frustration and anger are misdirected. We did not even know who the subject was, had no idea. We were looking at digital data”. The company charged $2,100 for the work, he added.

2,Rubbish cleaning delays PIA’s Manchester flight,A ground staffer of the airline says that such dirty conditions in the UK-Islamabad flight are not unusual and often happen.,"RAWALPINDI: A chartered flight of the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) from Manchester to Islamabad was delayed for four hours due to deep cleaning as the entire fuselage was littered with rubbish. 
A PIA official said it was not for the first time as often the departure of flights was delayed due to the deep cleaning of the planes that has to be done before take-off. 
He said that whenever a plane was littered with rubbish, especially if toilets were choked, it was handed over to engineers who thoroughly check all pipes and then give clearance. 
The latest episode came to light when pictures of PK-9785 flight went viral on social media. The new plane, which was obtained by the PIA on lease from Jordanian aviation, was littered with rubbish when it landed at Manchester airport on Wednesday. 
It took four hours of deep cleaning as plastic cups, water bottles, tissue papers, ripped chocolate wrappers, biscuits, and food waste were strewn on the floor after the passengers disembarked the plane. Pictures also showed toilet tissue papers strewn in the lavatory. 
Seats were looking dirty with food waste and what not which was left behind by the passengers who travelled from Islamabad to Manchester. Again the plane was littered with rubbish on return to Islamabad. 
“Passengers usually remain careful and behave well when they are onboard the flights operated by foreign airlines, but unfortunately, they don’t do so while onboard a PIA flight,” a spokesman for the national airline said. 
He said that often there were delays in the departure of flights due to deep cleaning of the plane which caused financial loss to the airline as well as inconvenience to the passengers. 
A PIA captain, who wished not to be named, said that once a PIA flight was delayed for eight hours due to the dirty condition of the plane and choked toilets. The plane was finally handed over to engineers and other relevant staff to get its drain pipes clean. He said that an alternative plane was arranged for the passengers, while the engineers opened the joints of the pipes of that plane to clean them. 
A ground staffer of the airline said that such dirty conditions in the UK-Islamabad flight was not unusual; it often happened. “As they boarded the UK flight, many passengers rushed to the kitchen carrying baby feeders for milk. Some scratch warning signs, damage seats, headphones and some pull seat belts.”

3,Vaccinating adults more urgent than children: WHO,Ministry of National Health Services official says over six million children aged 12 to 17 years have been vaccinated.,"ISLAMABAD: As Pakistan vaccinates over six million children, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said it is less urgent to vaccinate youngsters than the elderly. 
According to a statement, the WHO, with the support of Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunisation and its Covid-19 Vaccines Working Group, is reviewing the emerging evidence on the need for and timing of vaccinating children and adolescents with the currently available Covid-19 vaccines that have received Emergency Use Listing (EUL). The SAGE is continuously reviewing the literature and has reached out to vaccine manufacturers, the research community and member states to obtain the most complete and recent data on the issue. 
Although a majority of the vaccines have only been approved for administration to adults aged 18 years and above, an increasing number of the shots are now being authorised for children. Some countries, including Pakistan, have accorded emergency-use authorisation to the vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna for adolescents aged between 12 and 17 years. 

Official says ample quantity of vaccine available 

Earlier this month, a stringent regulatory authority approved the Pfizer vaccine for children aged five to 11 years. Trials in children as young as three years old were completed for two inactivated vaccines (Sinovac-CoronaVac and BBIBP-CorV) and they were approved by Chinese authorities for children aged three to 17 years; although these vaccines have received EUL for adults, they have not yet been approved for children. Several Covid-19 vaccines are undergoing trials in younger age groups (including as young as six months of age), but results have not yet been published. 
The WHO stated that children and adolescents usually demonstrated fewer and milder symptoms of infection than adults and were less likely than adults to experience severe Covid-19. 
“Countries should consider the individual and population benefits of immunising children and adolescents in their specific epidemiological and social context when developing their Covid-19 immunisation policies and programmes. As children and adolescents tend to have milder disease compared to adults, unless they are in a group at higher risk of severe Covid-19, it is less urgent to vaccinate them than older people, those with chronic health conditions and health workers,” it added. 
“There are benefits of vaccinating children and adolescents that go beyond the direct health benefits. Vaccination that decreases Covid-19 transmission in this age group may reduce transmission from children and adolescents to adults, and may help reduce the need for mitigation measures in schools. Minimising disruptions to education for children and maintenance of their overall well-being, health and safety are important considerations.” 
The UN health body suggested countries’ strategies related to Covid-19 control should facilitate children’s participation in education and other aspects of social life, and minimise school closures, even without vaccinating children and adolescents. 
“As a matter of global equity, as long as many parts of the world are facing extreme vaccine shortages, countries that have achieved high vaccine coverage in their high-risk populations should prioritise global sharing of Covid-19 vaccines through the Covax facility before proceeding to vaccination of children and adolescents who are at low risk for severe disease. It is of utmost importance for children to continue to receive the recommended childhood vaccines for other infectious diseases,” the statement read. 
Meanwhile, an official of the Ministry of National Health Services, requesting not to be quoted, said over six million children aged 12 to 17 years had been vaccinated. 
“We have an ample quantity of vaccines so we are vaccinating both adults and children. Vaccinating children will also benefit the elderly because it will decrease the chances of transmission of the infection from children to older people,” he added. 
The National Command and Operation Centre data showed that 350 infections and nine deaths were reported in the past 24 hours. The number of active cases has fallen to 14,188 as compared to around 90,000 in August.
