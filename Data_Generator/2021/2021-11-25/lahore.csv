1,Reply sought from SECP in plea against chief’s posting,LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Wednesday sought replies from the federal government and the Securities and...,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Wednesday sought replies from the federal government and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) in a petition challenging the appointment of Amir Ali Khan as the regulator’s chairman.Representing the petitioner, Advocate Hamza Haider submitted that the SECP consisted of five commissioners including the chairman.  
The respondent, Mr Khan, was appointed as the commissioner of the SECP on Dec 7, 2018, without making him resign from the post of executive director in the same organisation, the counsel said.He said the respondent tampered with the record and tendered his resignation from the previous position on back date and the Ministry of Finance was never intimated regarding his resignation.
The counsel argued that the commissioners were appointed under Section 5 of the SECP Act whereas the employees were appointed and governed under Section 8 of the same Act. 
He counsel maintained that a person could not hold two positions governed under separate provision of the law. The respondent was not only unqualified but did not have the requisite experience to be appointed as chairman, he added. 
He alleged that the respondent retained his both positions – executive director and commissioner – for nine months till his appointment as the chairman of the SECP. 
The counsel argued that the appointment of the respondent as chairman was illegal as he was appointed in the SECP’s internal vacancy even in presence of other two commissioners who were already appointed as internal candidates. 
He stated that the appointment of the respondent was in sheer violation of the laws and judgements passed by the Supreme Court. 
He asked the court to set aside the appointment of the respondent for being made in violation of law, without jurisdiction and based on nepotism. 
Justice Ayesha A Malik issued notices to the respondents and sought their replies by Jan 12, 2022.

2,SZH hit by adhocism amid shortage of permanent staff,LAHORE: The Shaikh Zayed Hospital (SZH) is hit by adhocism as the institute has been awaiting appointment of...,"LAHORE: The Shaikh Zayed Hospital (SZH) is hit by adhocism as the institute has been awaiting appointment of permanent officers/heads for the last many years.
The sorry state of affairs can be gauged from the fact that the chairman of 1,025-bed largest teaching institute has been heading the health facility on a look-after basis since May 2019.
The administrative control of the Shaikh Zayed Medical Complex Lahore was transferred from the province of Punjab to the federal government on April 22, 2019 through a notification issued by the Cabinet Division, Islamabad.
The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) dispensation in Punjab and Centre did not make permanent appointments of heads of key sections including the chairman.  
An official privy to the information said Prof Mateen Izhar who was currently running the institute on a look-after basis, retired on Wednesday (Nov 24).
Similarly, he said, the institute has no permanent deputy dean of the Post Graduate Medical Institute (PGMI) and nursing superintendent as well.  
The complex housing multiple institutes is also being run without permanent director finance.The official said all the six positions of the deputy and assistant administrators had been lying vacant for many years.
The SZH is also functioning without institute of nursing health sciences director, he said adding that all the above-mentioned slots were being looked after on a daily basis, mostly by ‘irrelevant’ officials.  
The official said the SZH has been one of the best public sector institutes of the country due to the internationally acclaimed health services particularly in liver and kidney transplant.
It was also the only public sector hospital which was recognised for providing the state-of-the-art nephrology services as it was housing largest dialysis centre for the kidney patients.Unfortunately, the official said, the institute was headed so far by only two permanently appointed heads - Prof Zafar Iqbal and Prof Farid Ahmad Khan.
Earlier, Prof Anwar A Khan had also served the institute as chairman for nearly eight years or so and that too on an additional charge basis.
After the transfer of the Shaikh Zayed Medical Complex from province to the cabinet division Islamabad in 2019, the employees hoped that the PTI government would bring about some relief for them. However, their hope dashed when the process of making appointment of regular/permanent heads of the units and the institute was ‘abandoned’ to facilitate the ‘irrelevant officials’ who were running it on a temporarily basis.  
The official said presently several posts of the medics, nurses, paramedics are lying vacant while many wards/departments are functioning by a few consultants.
The institute’s employees including medics and nurses had to face problems for non-payment of salaries for a certain period.
Following the seriousness of the matter, the six-member board of governor of the Shaikh Zayed Hospital held a meeting last week.
The BoG comprised former dean of the Children Hospital Lahore Prof Dr Sajid Maqbool, a senior pulmonologist from a private hospital Prof Rashid Siddique, a tax lawyer Naveed Andrabi and Umair Virk, Niaz Malik and Mrs Sharmim Ahmad having business background.
The meeting held a brainstorming session for a couple of hours and decided to select Prof Sajid Maqbool the chairman of the BoG from amongst the members, the official said.  
He said Prof Mateen Izhar who is retiring on Nov 24 as acting chairman of the institute, is again trying to hold the same post for another ‘indefinite period’.
However, pressure has been exerted from within the institute on the BoG to make appointment of next head of the institute on a permanent basis from the senior most faculty members.
A spokesperson for the Shaikh Zayed Hospital, Dr Ashtar Zaidi, said the institute’s administration was trying to resolve all the pending issues to improve management and patient care.
He said the BoG discussed various options in the brainstorming session to fill all the vacant slots.  
“All the appointments would be made as per the Medical Teaching Institutions (MTI) act which has been enforced,” he said adding that the slots would be advertised according to the given rules.  
The spokesperson said the BoG met to improve deficiencies in order to provide best treatment facilities to patients.

The locals, especially the businessmen, have been demanding reconstruction of the road passing through Gunjrat city since long as hundreds of industrial units are located along the busy artery. 
Moreover, Gujrat city has also been expanding towards Kathala railway crossing near the bridge on the River Chenab, necessitating reconstruction of the road. 
Deputy Commissioner Mehtab Waseem Azhar said the road would be constructed from Kathala Chenab to Rehmania bridge and over Bhimbher storm water channel, since these locations had been the city’s main entry and exit points. 
He added the project would also help improve the city entrance as greenbelts would also be developed along the road, besides installation of lights there. 
The reconstruction of the road has been approved by Punjab government on the recommendation of Federal Minister for Water Resources Moonis Elahi. The project will cost Rs1bn. 
A sum of Rs250m had initially been allocated for the project in Punjab’s annual development budget. As per the authorities concerned, the project might take at least one year to complete if the required funds were released timely.

16,"Non-compliance of rotation policy: Govt seeks explanation from 29 PAS, PSP officers",Federal govt has hinted at taking strict disciplinary action in case of non-compliance with direction to explain their position.,"LAHORE: The federal government has sought explanation from 29 police officers and bureaucrats serving across the country in BS-20 for defying transfer orders issued by the Establishment Division, Islamabad, under the newly-enforced Rotation Policy 2020.  
Defending the officers for not complying with the orders, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah and Punjab Chief Secretary Kamran Ali Afzal have written letters to the prime minister and the Establishment Division, respectively. 
The Punjab chief secretary stated in his letter that the province was already facing shortage of PAS and PSP officers and requested that the transferred officers be allowed to continue serving till their replacements were found. 
The Sindh chief minister says the federal government had posted only 50 per cent of the sanctioned strength of PAS and PSP officers in the province. And in case of BS-20 officers, only 20 officers were posted in Sindh against the sanctioned strength of 67 seats. In case of PSP officers in BS-20, he stated, 22 officers against the strength of 26 were posted in Sindh. 
The Establishment Division snubbed the Punjab chief secretary saying the Rotation Policy 2020 was framed in consultation with the chief secretaries in a bid to rationalise shortage of officers in each grade among the provincial governments by transferring the least rotated officers. “Any compromise on this issue will result in you and I compromising on and undermining the policy,” the Establishment Division secretary stated. 
Meanwhile, the explanation letters issued to the senior PAS and PSP officers were being considered as a major action. In case of not complying with the direction to explain their position, the federal government has hinted at initiating strict disciplinary action. In August 2020, Prime Minister Imran Khan in consultation with the provinces had approved the new rotation policy to ensure that the civil servants belonging to PAS and PSP do not stay in a single province or station for more than a specified number of years. The Division transferred the officers some two weeks ago for serving more than 10 years consecutively in a province. 
Later, it transpired that they had not joined their duties even two weeks after the transfer orders. The Establishment Division took up the matter with the prime minister who directed it to start departmental proceedings and it issued notices to the 29 officers seeking explanation from them within seven days. 
An explanation notification issued to a police officer serving in the National Highways and Motorways Police reads, “I am directed to refer to the subject noted above and to state that the Division placed your services at the disposal of the Baluchistan government under Rotation Policy 2020 but you have not yet submitted your joining report.” 
“I am therefore directed to ask you to explain your position regarding non-compliance of above transfer orders in writing within seven days of issuance of this explanation so as to enable this Division to take further necessary action in the matter.” 
The Division also warned the officers that if explanation was not received in the specified time or it was found to be unsatisfactory, a case for disciplinary proceedings would be recommended against them. 
Some senior officers see it as a ‘political move’ saying the ruling elite in the federal government believes that these officers have developed ‘political affiliations’ with the PML-N and the PPP while serving in Punjab and Sindh over a period of 10 years. The question that needs to be asked is whether these transfers will add to stability in the provinces or vice versa, they ask. 
An officer said the Division initiated major departmental action when the Sindh government recently refused to relieve the officers and asked it to review its decision. The Punjab government also delayed the process of relieving the officers and requested the Division to allow them to continue services till their replacements were found, he said. 
However, he said, the federal government turned down the requests of both provinces, giving a clear message to them that they were civil servants and the Establishment Division was the only competent authority that reserved right to regulate their transfer/postings and promotion matters. The explanation notices were issued to DIG NH&MP Mansoor Alam Kolachi, Sindh Director FIA Zone-II Mohammad Younas Chandio, Pakistan Railways DIG South Shahzad Akbar, Sindh DIG CTD Omer Shahid Hamid, awaiting posting in Sindh Abdullah Sheikh, Karachi DIG CIA Nouman Siddiqui, Karachi Range DIG East Zone Saqib Ismail Memon, Karachi Range South Zone DIG Javed Akbar Riaz, Sindh Special Branch DIG Naeem Ahmad Sheikh, Karachi Range Security and Emergency Services DIG Lt (Rtd) Maqsood Ahmad, Sahiwal RPO Ahmad Arslan Malik, Punjab Special Branch Additional IG Zaeem Iqbal Sheikh, Multan RPO Syed Khurram Ali, Sheikhupura RPO Inam Waheed, Punjab Traffic DIG Sohail Akhtar Sukhera, Punjab Headquarters DIG Zubair Dreshak and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Malakand RPO Abdul Ghafoor Afridi. 
The PAS officers who were directed to submit explanation include Punjab Management and Special Development Department Secretary Ali Tahir, DG Khan Division Commissioner Sarah Aslam, Sargodha Division Commissioner Ms Farah Masood, Khyber Pakhtunkhawa Forestry, Environment and Wildlife Department Secretary Lt (Rtd) Islam Zaib, Sindh Planning and Development Board Chairman Syed Hassan Naqvi, Rawalpindi Defence Division Joint Secretary Noreen Bashir, Sindh PPHI Chief Executive Zahid Ali Abbasi, Lahore Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) Managing Director Khalid Saleem, Punjab Finance Department Secretary Flt.
