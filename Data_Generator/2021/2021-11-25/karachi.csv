0,Demolition of Nasla Tower begins from ground floor,"On SC order, a private club built on CAA land also being razed","KARACHI: The local administration on Wednesday finally started demolition operation of Nasla Tower hours after the Supreme Court rebuked the Karachi commissioner on his failure to comply with its orders, bringing the over five-month saga to almost its close as collapse of the 15-storey residential building through government machinery is imminent.
However, questions emerged over the method of demolition picked by the administration which unlike past operations of this nature chose to start demolition from the ground floor. The officials of Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) and the Karachi commissioner supervising the labourers and heavy machinery operators, however, did not tell why they had started demolition from the ground unlike past operations against the illegal buildings when demolition operation usually began from the top.
Earlier in the morning, taking up the matter the Supreme Court directed the commissioner to immediately demolish Nasla Tower and warned him of action in case of non-compliance. The warning came after a three-judge SC bench, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Gulzar Ahmed, asked Commissioner Iqbal Memon about the demolition of the building.

On SC order, a private club built on CAA land also being razed

Commissioner earns SC ire
The commissioner contended that about Rs220 million was required to demolish the building. The CJP came down hard on Mr Memon and said that the court had already passed an order that the cost of delimitation would be borne by the building’s owners/builders and the commissioner was also allowed to sell the land if the amount was not recovered from the builders.
The CJP warned that the commissioner would be sent to jail and removed from his post for not complying with court orders and delaying demolition process.
The commissioner offered an apology and the CJP directed him to immediately demolish the building and file a report during the course of day.
The matter is again likely to be taken up by the apex court on Thursday (today).
Initially, the apex court had ordered the demolition of the building in June for partly encroaching upon the land meant for a service road. In September the review petition of the builder of Nasla Tower against the June 16 order was turned down.
In June, the Supreme Court had also directed the builders to refund the amount to the registered buyers/allottees of residential and commercial units of the building within three months.
In case of any delay in payment, the claimants may claim mark-up/profit at the bank rate with damages and initiate proceedings for implementation of this order before the court of competent jurisdiction, the court ordered.
The residents of the building finally vacated the building on October 28.

Within minutes after the Supreme Court’s warning on Wednesday, things started moving around Nasla Tower where a fleet of heavy machinery including a bulldozer, excavators, compact track loaders, skid steer loaders, dozers and others were seen parking along the main road. Within next couple of hours, over a 100 men wearing protected gear came to the site to finally launch the demolition operation.
Extraordinary hustle and bustle was seen on the edge of Shahra-i-Quaideen off main Sharea Faisal where Nasla Tower is located. Over a dozen satellite vans of news channels coupled with vehicles of Rangers were lined up along the service lane. With traffic movement turning slow due to congestion on the main road, the operation was finally launched in the second half of the day.
Though there was no statement from the Karachi commissioner office about the expected timeline of the operation nor there was any word shared by the SBCA, with the pace of the operation it emerged that it could take days to complete the job.
Private club on CAA land
Similar action was seen near Karachi airport where a team of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) led the operation and started demolition of a private club which was illegally raised on the land of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Heavy machinery started demolishing boundary wall and concrete structure of the club and the authorities were hopeful that the job would be completed by Thursday.
Earlier, the CJP observed as to how the club, which had private membership, could be allowed on the land of the CAA. The CAA director general said that the club was established in 1990s. However, he said that they were ready to remove the club on the court order.
Meanwhile, the SC bench directed the FIA to clear 209 acres of land allotted the CAA for building a new terminal from the encroachers and hand it over to aviation authority.
The CAA DG submitted that the 209 acres were allotted to the CAA by the Sindh government in 1992 but the Board of Revenue had illegally allotted the land to private persons by bifurcating it into plots.
The FIA submitted that they had registered two FIRs and arrested four persons as fake entries were made in the record of BoR.
The bench noted that as per report of the FIA, the BoR had allotted land to one Nabi Bux, who did not exit, and then power of attorneys was given to several private persons.

1,Transferred officials may join new posting to avoid action,Eight DIGs who were recently transferred from Sindh to other provinces reportedly decide to relinquish charge.,"KARACHI: After receiving explanation letters from the establishment division, eight DIGs, who were recently transferred from Sindh to other provinces under the federal government’s rotation policy, have reportedly decided to relinquish charge to join their new posting, it emerged on Wednesday.
A senior officer familiar with this development said that if the Sindh government approached the apex court and if any restraining order was issued then the officials might stay in the province, otherwise they would relinquish their posts in compliance with their transfer notifications to avoid any disciplinary action.
The establishment division on Nov 23 had given explanation letters to the senior officers in Sindh and other provinces as they had not joined their new assignments in compliance with the Nov 9 transfer orders warning them of disciplinary proceedings.
Four officers of the Pakistan Administrative Service (PAS) —Hassan Naqvi, Zahid Ali Abbasi, Dr Kazim Hussain Jatoi and Khalid Hyder Shah — and seven BS-20 Police Services of Pakistan (PSP) officers — DIGs Abdullah Shaikh, Nouman Siddiqui, Saqib Ismail Memon, Javed Akbar Riaz, Naeem Shaikh, Maqsood Ahmed and Omar Shahid Hamid — were transferred from Sindh on Nov 9, but the provincial government had refused to relieve them.
There is no indication that whether the four PAS officers would join their PSP colleagues in relinquishing charge or continue to stick to their posts in the province.
Meanwhile,Sindh Infor­ma­tion Minister Saeed Ghani said that the law and order of the province would be compromised if the federal government was allowed to ‘unilaterally’ withdraw seven senior police officers posted in the province.
Talking to the media at the Sindh Assembly, the minister said the ‘proposal’ to transfer the PSP officers was not acceptable to the provincial government as maintenance of the law and order was its responsibility.
He reiterated the demand that the Centre immediately withdraw its transfer orders as the same request was also contained in a letter sent by the chief minister to the prime minister.
He said the Sindh had 26 posts of grade-20 police officials and against them 22 PSP officers were working in the province. He said that similarly, Sindh was still facing a shortage of 44 PAS officers.

He directed the authorities to submit a report with regard to the death of the lion.
In 2012, a new glass enclosure was built on the occasion of the arrival of the big cat so that the citizens visiting the zoo can fully see the lion.

4,Yet another private members’ day in Sindh Assembly marred by protest,Haleem Adil Sheikh warns over threat to democracy in Sindh; probe into theft of 6.8m tonnes of wheat across country.,"KARACHI: Yet another private members’ day in the Sindh Assembly was marred on Wednesday due to chaos and uproar as lawmakers belonging to the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf protested over more than one hour delay in start of the proceedings.
As Deputy Speaker Rehana Leghari entered the house to start proceedings, the opposition members gathered in front of the speaker’s rostrum asking the chair as to why the proceeding were delayed.
They, however, took their seats after she called for recitation of Quran, followed by dua.
The PTI members again started protesting when the chair allowed Parliamentary Affairs Minister Mukesh Kuamr Chawla to give a policy statement ahead of Question Hour.

Haleem warns over threat to democracy in Sindh; probe into theft of 6.8m tonnes of wheat across country

The PTI members brought a megaphone in the house and chanted anti-government slogans. They alleged that their business was killed and not being brought up in the house.
Opposition leader reprimanded
The chair took exception to the opposition members’ protest terming it ‘deplorable. “Under Rule 261, a minister can give a policy statement at any time,” she said while trying to calm down the agitating lawmakers.
When Opposition Leader Haleem Adil Sheikh wanted to speak, Ms Leghari said that she would not allow if the attitude persisted.
“You tore up copies of agenda and threw at me, I will not permit you to speak. You will be allowed to speak thousands of time but only when you change your attitude,” she said while making it clear that she would not take dictation from anyone.
In his policy statement, Minister Chawala, who also holds the portfolio of food ministry, denied any wheat theft in the province and said that a federal minister had made “baseless” accusations.
“After the federal cabinet meeting, a federal minister accused that 1.6 million tonnes wheat was stolen from Sindh but in fact, our total procurement is 1.2 million tonnes,” he added.
He said that 6.8 million tonnes wheat was stolen from the country, demanding that it should be probed. He said that a ‘mafia’ was sitting in the federal government, which was behind the hike in prices of sugar, petrol and flour.
Later, the chair allowed Opposition Leader Sheikh to speak. He said that they had to bring the megaphone as their microphones were not being turned on. “Whenever the government wanted, we ensured smooth running of the house,” he added.
Mr Haleem said that important business of the opposition was being ‘killed’, saying that that their call attention notices were not being included in the agenda.
‘Democracy in danger’
He said that in the earlier sitting of the current session, the chair, held by Sharjeel Inam Memon as chairman, had assured that a resolution on Nazim Jokhio murder would be taken up but to no avail.
The opposition leader said that neither chairmanship of the Public Accounts Committee was given to the opposition nor it had representation in standing committees.
“Democracy is in danger in Sindh,” Mr Sheikh said.
Muttahida Quami Movement-P’s Muhammad Hussain Khan on a point of order suggested that a meeting of business advisory committee could be held to sort out issues pertaining to the agenda. He said that during the last session, business advisory committee held its meeting and no unpleasant incident was happened and the proceedings continued smoothly.
Speaking on a point of order, Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal’s Syed Abdul Rasheed said that two people of Layri got injured when identified men opened fire on them during their protest against power breakdown. He demanded that the provincial government arrest the culprits or else he would stage a protest outside the assembly.
The house was adjourned to Thursday.

5,Visitors show interest in Italian delicacies at culinary workshop,‘Italian Cuisine Week is more about the people of Italy than food’,"

Italian Consul General Danilo Guirdanella (left), cheese expert Antonio Fracciolla (centre) and Chef Samuele Crestale. — Fahim Siddiqi / White Star

 
KARACHI: Even though it was just water boiling, the little puffs of steam escaping out of the saucepan, whenever Chef Samuele Crestale lifted its lid, hinted at something incredibly delicious to come out of the chef’s efforts at the Italian cooking workshop, which was part the HoReCa Summit during the Italian Cuisine Week being held at a local hotel here on Wednesday.
Chef Crestale, later, got very busy, rolling dough, cutting the strips of flour into small cubes before transferring them to the saucepan to boil, warming up the sauce, adding to it red beans, pieces of stale bread and all to cook up a storm called pisarei e faso, generous helpings of which he offered his entire audience to taste. The dish is said to be a classic, originating from Emilia-Romagna, a region in northern Italy.
His next offering was a semi-frozen dessert called Semifreddo al Fondente. “It’s half cold, with a consistency between ice cream and mousse topped with chocolate and strawberry,” he explained.
While everyone crowded around Chef Crestale to watch him cook and taste his delicacies, those who gathered around his colleague, the cheese expert, Antonio Fracciolla enjoyed listening to him and what he had to tell them about the various types of cheeses he had brought with him all the way from Italy. Still, many shied away when it came to tasting the cheeses. “It’s an acquired taste,” he said while offering it to them.

‘Italian Cuisine Week is more about the people of Italy than food’

There were cheeses in the shape of bricks, balls, cylinders, etc, some still with the strings they were hung from to dry out or age. There were goat cheese known as caciotta di capra, buffalo milk cheese known as quadrello di bufala, sheep milk cheese known as capestrano puglielse, goat and sheep milk cheese that has been aged for eight months known as junco mixed, natural cheese fermented for eight months in the cave known as cacio cavallo, natural cheese fermented in a cave for 12 months known as provolone fragno quarceta, natural cheese fermented in a cave for 18 months known as provolone quarceta and blu cheese of buffalo milk with Penicillium rocqueforti.
The audience cringed at the thought of fermented or rotting cheese or cheese with fungus. But the cheese expert relished it. He briefed the audience on the history and importance of cheese making in Italian culture, which they take great pride in. He has himself earned several trophies for cheese tasting all over the world.
It was the first time for both the chef and the cheese expert to be in Pakistan. Fracciolla had flown in straight from Italy while Chef Crestale was here from Dubai, where he has been employed by a hotel chain for 12 years now. “I am very careful about halal food,” he told Dawn.
Alongside the workshop, there were also several stalls that showcased food ingredients and samples using Italian goods.
The Consul General of Italy in Karachi Danilo Guirdanella was also present. He also spoke about the benefits of a Mediterranean diet as a balanced diet model for a healthy lifestyle. About Italian Cuisine Week, he said that it is more about the people of Italy than food.
“Our food, we share with others. Sharing is caring. We care for others,” he said.

6,Defence secretary summoned in cantonment land conversion case,Justice Ijaz Ul Ahsan wonders how housing societies are being established on land allotted for defence purposes.,"KARACHI: Observing that the conversion of cantonment land into private land in the metropolis was apparently in violation of laws as well as various provisions of the Constitution, the Supreme Court on Wednesday summoned the defence secretary and attorney general of Pakistan for Nov 26 (tomorrow).
A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Gulzar Ahmed also put the chief executive officers (CEOs) of all the cantonment boards in Karachi as well as the Sindh advocate general on notice.
While dictating the order during Wednesday’s proceedings at the apex court’s Karachi registry, the CJP asked the attorney general to explain as to how park/amenity land in the cantonment areas of the city was being used for commercial activities.
The land allotted to the Pakistan Army, Navy and Air Force and meant for defence purposes has progressively been used or allotted /leased / transferred by the cantonment authorities to the personnel of armed forces for their own personal use, housing societies, commercial buildings and other purposes, he added.

Justice Ijaz Ul Ahsan wonders how housing societies are being established on land allotted for defence purposes

The CJP further said that the cantonment land had been allotted / leased out by the federal and provincial governments for cantonment purposes and the very nature of the land cannot be changed by giving personal statue.
He stated that the conversion of cantonment land into private land seems to be in direct contravention of Cantonment Act 1924, Cantonment Land Rules 1937 and various constitutional provisions and this issue needed to be heard and decided by this court.
The bench also comprising Justice Ijaz Ul Ahsan and Justice Qazi Mohammad Amin Ahmed was informed that there were encroachments on public spaces in the jurisdiction of cantonment boards and commercial buildings and housing societies on the land meant for cantonment purposes in different areas of the city.
The bench expressed resentment over the director, cantonment and military land, Karachi region, Adil Rafi Siddiqui over such activities within the jurisdiction of cantonment boards and also sought a report from him about a wall being built on the premises of park in Defence Housing Authority Phase-I.
Justice Ashan said that how the land meant for defence installations could be used for residential and other profitable purposes, adding that the status of such land cannot be changed.
He also asked the cantonment official under which law housing societies were being established and land of defence installations was being converted for other purposes.
Plea against commercial use of Askari Park
The bench also issued notices to the Karachi administrator, commander engineer, Corps-V, and others on an application against using the Askari Park near old Sabzi Mandi for commercial purposes.
The bench had issued notices to respondents on the last hearing, but it was informed that nobody appeared from military authorities on Wednesday.
Earlier, an applicant had submitted that the land of park belonged to the KMC and an agreement for adoption of such land was made between the then city district government Karachi and the military authorities in 2005 for development and maintenance of the park.
However, the applicant argued that wedding halls and other commercial activities were being carried out on the premises of the park.
Anger at provincial authorities
The Supreme Court on Wednesday came down hard on the provincial authorities over sudden transfers of officials posted on key positions and warned to pass an order if situation not changed.
The bench observed that it had been issuing various directives to the Karachi commissioner and other officials, but they were swiftly transferred while the director general of the Karachi Development Authority (KDA) was also removed hardly a few months after his appointment and he got a stay order from the high court.
The CJP asked the advocate general that the bench was restraining itself from interfering in the affairs of provincial authorities but if such practice continued the judges would have to pass an appropriate order in this regard.
The CJP said this when KDA chief submitted that his wife, also severing in garde-20 in Sindh, was forced to “sit at home”.
The bench directed the DG to take measurers for restoration of all parks/playgrounds within the jurisdiction of the KDA after removing encroachments.
It further said that encroachments around Jam Sadiq Bridge in Korangi and on an amenity plot meant for park in Korangi-5 must also be removed.
The DG submitted that he was aware of such illegal encroachments on public spaces and would remove the same and restore the land for the purpose it meant.
Parks of KMC
The bench said that Karachi Administrator Murtaza Wahab also assured it that he would take action to clear parks, playgrounds and public spaces and maintain them properly.
It was also pointed out during proceedings that a supra body may be formed to monitor all the parks of the city and Mr Wahab assured the bench that he would place this issue before the cabinet for legislation.
Amber Alibhoi of Shehri-Citizens for a Better Environment informed the bench that there were 24 places in the city meant for parks which were being used as dumping sites.
The CJP asked the administrator to take immediate steps for restoration of such land while all other parks must be properly developed and maintained and sought a compliance report in two weeks.
The administrator was asked about the restoration of four natural lakes of the city including Jheel Park and deplored that constructions had been made on such lands including a private school.
The advocate general submitted that such lakes had been dried up as the water level had gone down. However, the administrator submitted that he would consult technical experts and try to restore such lakes.
Mr Wahab was of the view that the city council during the tenure of former Karachi mayors Naimatullah Khan and Mustafa Kamal had passed resolutions for commercialisation of many roads of the city and thereafter, rapid commercialization had been started across the city.
However, a lawyer also pointed out that the provincial government had also commercialized several thoroughfares in 2010 and 2016.
Gutter Baghicha
The bench ruled that a portion of around 200 acre at the Gutter Baghicha Park was illegally allotted to the KMC Officers Housing Society in 1993 and the same was liable to be cancelled.
It further said that the park was existed even before partition and meant for amenity purposes and unfortunately the KMC, which was required to build a park there, allotted the land to its officers for a housing society, which was illegal.
It was informed that the allotment was made but no construction had so far been made.

KARACHI: Aqeel Solangi is an artist steeped in culture and tradition. At the same time, his art pushes boundaries in a subtle way; so subtle that the viewer doesn’t even realise that what s/he’s just witnessed is a breathtaking combination of contemporariness and convention. An exhibition of Solongi’s latest body of work titled Distant Fields is underway at the Koel Art Gallery.
The show once again reinforces his noteworthy ability to effortlessly meld the above described two worlds.
Here’s a measure of how he approaches his art: “I used to write takhti in my primary school as it was an essential practice in schools to write on takhti (wooden tablet). The repetition of flowers in the Fasl e Gul series, in my opinion, is like the repetition of letters that I used to write in my childhood. It was sort of a ritual to write a takhti everyday and clean and coat it with Multani Matti, like a mandala or rangoli ritual is being performed everyday and dismantled every day. The repetition of writing the same letters was to get perfection over the alphabet/language, but besides that I think there is a spiritual side to it, we use to recite and repeat verses everyday without realising its repetition for our spiritual gain.”


Some of the artworks put up on display in the exhibition.—White Star

 
It is such a delight to know that in this day and age, where technology reigns supreme, there is someone who is talking about the age-old gray slate on which young children in schools and madressahs used to write to have a the right feel of the alphabet, and not just learn their shapes. Then his deep association with matti (soil) enables him to have a dispassionate view of the developing world and allows him to see it with eyes that look for nature and its munificence in everything. As a result, beautiful artworks such as ‘Chandol’ (acrylic on canvas) and ‘Titliyon Ka Des’ (acrylic on wooden tablet) along with the series that Solangi mentions in his statement come into being. Simply stupendous!
The exhibition concludes on Dec 1.

“This speaks volumes for the provincial government’s pragmatic and result-oriented healthcare policies, therefore we are launching the Mother & Child Support Programme to register pregnant mothers at health facilities close to their homes, and provide them cash support for each scheduled visit including institutional delivery,” he said at the inauguration ceremony of the Mother and Child Support Programme launched by the Social Protection Strategy Unit at CM House.
Bilawal said that according to demographic and health survey conducted by USAID and UKAID for 2013-18 neonatal mortality had decreased by 19 per cent in Punjab, increased by two per cent in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and decreased by 30 per cent in Sindh. “Similarly, the infant mortality rate decreased by 17 per cent in Punjab and 19 per cent in Sindh and nine per cent in KPK,” he said.
The chief minister said that the WHO-recommended services, such as ante-natal check-ups, safe delivery, postnatal care, child growth monitoring and immunisation were available free of cost at public health facilities throughout the province, which had resulted in improvement in key indicators such as institutional deliveries.
“This is the first programme which forms part of a comprehensive provincial social protection strategy being rolled out by the Sindh government in coming months,” he announced.
He said the programme registered pregnant mothers at health facilities close to their homes and provides them with cash support for each scheduled visit, including institutional delivery. “The women are given Rs1,000 at each scheduled antenatal, postnatal and child healthcare visits, Rs4,000 for institutional or healthcare facility-based delivery and Rs2,000 for birth registration with NADRA,” he said.
He said that as a pilot intervention, the programme had been launched in two union councils each in Tharparkar and Umerkot districts. “It will be subsequently extended to all districts in next three months and further expanded to cover the entire province within next two years,” he said.

10,WB mission proposes bringing three barrages under control of one chief engineer,DADU: World Bank has agreed to carry out pre-feasible study for the construction of new Sukkur barrage and proposed...,"DADU: World Bank has agreed to carry out pre-feasible study for the construction of new Sukkur barrage and proposed to Sindh government establishment of a “barrage management unit” to bring three barrages under the control of one chief engineer instead of three officers looking after the barrages separately.
Francois Onimus, Task Team Leader of the World Bank’s Technical Support Mission comprising John Petherick, project manager of Guddu and Sukkur barrages and Chris Hall, chief resident engineer of Guddu Barrage Rehabilitation Project, suggested at a meeting here on Wednesday to the project director of Sindh Barrages Improvement Project (SBIP), Ghulam Mohiuddin Mughal, to conduct pre-feasible study for new Sukkur barrage, which was demanded by Sindh government.
Mr Onimus said that barrage management unit (BMU) would help ensure equitable water distribution, sediment management and surveillance of barrages in Sindh.
The mission have been visiting sites of SBIP in the province for the last four days to assess the progress on the Guddu and Sukkur barrages’ rehabilitation and modernisation project.
The SBIP project director Ghulam Mohiuddin Mughal said in his presentation to the mission that ten main gates had arrived from Turkey at the Guddu barrage site and work on the replacement of gates would start next week.
Furthermore, he said the work on river training works had been completed except for strengthening and widening of spur at upstream Guddu barrage. Four out of six gates had already been replaced at Sukkur barrage and the remaining would be changed shortly, he said.
He said that contract documents of replacement of the remaining 30 gates of the Sukkur barrage and 165 gates of head regulators would be floated in international, national and local newspapers after their review by consultants.
Mr Onimus held another meeting with Minister for Irrigation Jam Khan Shoro and officers concerned of his department in which Mohammad Ayoob Soomro, additional technical secretary of irrigation made a presentation on the proposed establishment of BMU and said that the post of adviser Water Distribution Cell was suggested to be redesignated and upgraded to chief engineer of BMU.
Directorate of hydrology and research might also be shifted from the office of chief engineer of Kotri to the BMU with enhanced terms of reference (ToRs) and qualifications. The new setup would improve efficient operation maintenance of the three barrages, he said.
The minister Jam Khan Shoro said the proposed reforms would be placed before cabinet and chief minister for discussion and approval.
Mr Onimus appreciated the Sindh government’s willingness to consider the proposal for establishing BMU which would work on water monitoring, sediment management, mergence of prepared plans and surveillance and maintenance of barrages.
He said the main objective of the bank was to help the Sindh government in introducing reforms in water sector to enhance economy of the province. Furthermore, draft of Sindh water policy for integrating water resources had been prepared, he said.
The minister stressed the need for involving more stakeholders in the process of framing water policy and proposing changes to Irrigation Act 1879 to make the two compatible with each other.
He asked Mr Onimus to conduct feasibility study for the new Sukkur barrage. It should have been conducted 30 years earlier or even before that because almost all possible sites for the new barrage had already been occupied by housing schemes, roads, bridges and other heavy structures. Hence, this study must be conducted at the earliest, he said.
Mr Oniums agreed and suggested to PD of SBIP to prepare terms of reference for pre-feasibility study of the new barrage at Sukkur.
The meeting was attended by Jamaluddin Mangan, special secretary (technical) irrigation department; Mohammad Ayoob Soomro, additional secretary (technical); Sohail Ahmed Qureshi, secretary irrigation; chief engineers of Sukkur, Guddu and Kotri barrages, Syed Sardar Shah, Mohammad Ishaq Abbasi and Haji Khan Jamali, respectively, chief engineer of small dams organisation, Shafqat Hussain Wadho, managing director Sindh Irrigation and Drainage Authority Pretam Das, deputy project coordinator Sajid Ali Bhutto, deputy director environment Dr Ali Asghar Mahesar, director mechanical Noor Al Arfin and Imran Aziz Tunio, technical officer of SBIP.
In yet another meeting with high officials of irrigation department, Mr Onimus advised a model study of river training works of Sukkur barrage.
He advised flood routing study for Guddu and Sukkur barrages to avoid recurrence of breach in the river dykes.
