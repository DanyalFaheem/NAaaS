3,"Stocks sink for third day, index loses 585 points",Foreign investors remain net sellers as they offload shares worth $12.26m on a net basis.,"KARACHI: Bears dominated the Pakistan Stock Exchange for the third straight day on Wednesday amid the upcoming announcement of a mini-budget ahead of the resumption of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme. 
According to JS Global, selling pressure persisted throughout the session partly because of the upcoming removal of general sales tax exemptions as well as concerns over the rollover settlement. 
As a result, the KSE-100 index lost 584.82 points (or 1.3 per cent) to close at 44,363.7 points. 
Market participation increased 17.3pc to 310.38 million shares while the value of traded shares rose 33.1pc to Rs12.94 billion. 
Sectors taking away the highest number of points from the benchmark index included commercial banking (159 points), fertiliser (123.76 points), cement (117.79 points), pharmaceutical (48.74 points) and oil and gas marketing (33.1 points). 
Stocks that contributed significantly to the traded volume included TRG Pakistan Ltd (26.52m shares), WorldCall Telecom Ltd (24.68m shares), TPL Properties Ltd (24.08m shares), TeleCard Ltd (15.43m shares) and Byco Petroleum Ltd (14.78m shares).

Shares that contributed negatively included Systems Ltd (75.94 points), Engro Corporation Ltd (65.71 points), Habib Bank Ltd (55.37 points), Fauji Fertiliser Ltd (51.98 points) and MCB Bank Ltd (40.95 points).

Foreign investors remained net sellers as they offloaded shares worth $12.26m on a net basis. 
“A cautious approach is advised as the market is likely to face further pressure in the coming sessions — an overhang of pre-conditions related to the IMF programme continues to dent the sentiments,” said JS Global.

4,SBP sees 4-5pc GDP growth in FY22,Annual report about state of country’s economy released.,"KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has declared that addressing deep-rooted structural impediments is crucial for sustaining and improving the current growth momentum. 
“These impediments include consistent decline in the yield of important crops (especially cotton); insufficient export coverage of imports, low and declining productivity of labor, stagnant tax-to-GDP ratio, anemic investment-to-GDP ratio, and the rising fiscal burden of the power sector,” stated the SBP in its annual report, which was issued on Wednesday. 
The SBP in its report, The State of Pakistan Economy, projected the GDP growth in the range of four to five per cent for the financial year 2022. It said the economic recovery during the last fiscal year is projected to gain further momentum in FY22. “This is evident in the significant increase in machinery and raw material imports, continued expansion in consumer financing, and strong uptrend in domestic sales as seen from high frequency demand indicators during the initial months of FY22,” the report said.  

Annual report about state of country’s economy released 

Both the supply and demand channels were expected to contribute to the higher growth outcome, said the report, adding that the FY22 budget stipulated a sharp expansion in development spending that would give a push to construction and allied industries.
The report projected the agriculture sector to further benefit from the support packages for the Kharif and Rabi crops. 
The SBP envisaged the fiscal deficit within the range of 6.3pc to 7.3pc of GDP for FY22. This outcome would be driven by the continued check on non-priority current spending and an expansion in both tax and non-tax revenues. 
On the non-tax revenue side, the government primarily relies on collection from the Gas Infrastructure Development Cess (GIDC), with the settlement of issues in litigation.  
“The sustained turnaround in sales of petroleum products may also boost collection from the petroleum development levy,” said the report. 
For the FY22, the SBP projected remittances between $30.5bn and $32.5bn; exports ranging from $26.5bn to $27.5bn and imports between $62.5bn and $63.5bn. 
In the external sector, pressures are emerging from the import side, with payments exceeding the $6bn in three of the past four months (June, August and September 2021), it said. The surge in imports is broad-based, partly reflecting the increasing pace of economic activity, a further increase in the global commodity prices, continued imports of agricultural commodities, automobiles and many consumption-related items. 
“The current account deficit is projected in the range of 2 to 3 per cent of GDP during FY22,” the report stated, while the current account deficit of four months (July-Oct FY22) had already reached 4.7pc of GDP. 
A part of the expansion in the import payments is projected to be financed through a consistent increase in workers’ remittances and export receipts, according to the SBP report.  
The outlook for financial flows is likely to remain conducive, on the back of the $3.8bn already received from the global special drawing rights (SDR) allocations and from Eurobond, along with further loan disbursements from multilateral and bilateral creditors, and inflows into the RDAs (Roshan Digital Accounts). 
Inflation risk
The national consumer price index (CPI) inflation is expected to remain between seven and nine per cent whereas headline inflation is expected to retreat more visibly in the second half of the year, with the phasing out of the base impact of the hike in power tariffs, said the report. “These projections are subject to multiple upside risks, including from a greater-than-anticipated increase in global commodity prices and upward revision in utility tariffs,” the SBP report pointed out. 
In addition to triggering a sharp increase in domestic prices, these developments could also give rise to significant second-round impacts on inflation, it highlighted. 
The report said Pakistan’s economy rebounded during FY21, with real GDP growth rising to 3.9pc. Importantly, this expansion in economic activity was accompanied by a 10-year low current account balance that contributed to a significant build-up in foreign exchange reserves. It said the SBP’s liquidity support amounted to around 5pc of GDP by the end of FY21, featuring a combination of policy rate cuts as well as several targeted and time-bound measures.

5,NPMC wants action against fertiliser hoarders,Adviser on finance Shaukat Tarin asks ministry to suggest a whistleblower law against hoarders.,"ISLAMABAD: The National Price Monitoring Committee (NPMC) directed provincial governments on Wednesday to take punitive measures against fertiliser hoarders and ensure the commodity’s availability at controlled rates. 
On the stock position of fertilisers, the committee was informed that Punjab and Sindh governments have taken actions against hoarders. The Punjab government has established control rooms in districts to monitor the stock position of fertilisers and appropriate actions are being taken on complaints against high prices. 
The NPMC meeting, chaired by Adviser on Finance and Revenue Shaukat Tarin and attended by relevant federal secretaries and chief secretaries of provinces, reviewed the prices of everyday commodities and essential food items in the country.  
Mr Tarin directed the Ministry of Industries and Production to initiate a whistleblower law against hoarders and prioritise its enforcement.

Secretary Finance Yusuf Khan said that sugar prices were easing in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa due to proactive measures taken by the government. The new stocks of sugar were arriving in the market which would further lower the prices, he said.   
Mr Tarin expressed his satisfaction with the stability in sugar prices and asked the Ministry of Industries and Production to take appropriate measures for creating strategic reserves of sugar in the country for a smooth supply in the coming months. 
The secretary informed the committee that the price of wheat flour remained consistent at Rs1,100 per 20kg. The daily release of wheat by provincial governments will further ease prices. 
The meeting observed that an increase in edible oil price on the global market has affected local prices. However, it was informed that international prices of palm oil / soya bean would start declining from January onward and would subsequently be passed on to consumers. 
On the stock position of kerosene, Mr Tarin directed the petroleum division to take measures for ensuring its availability to support the low-income segment of society. 
The meeting observed that Sasta Sahulat Bazaars in Punjab and KP are offering essential goods at subsidised rates. Mr Tarin also expressed his satisfaction with the prices of commodities in similar bazaars operating in Balochistan and Sindh and directed that such bazaars should be set up in more cities to provide maximum relief to the public. 
The finance secretary briefed the meeting about the weekly Sensitive Price Indicator, which has increased by 1.07pc during the week ended on Nov 18.  
He informed the meeting that the prices of 10 essential commodities dropped, whereas the prices of 14 items remained stable during the week under review. Besides, the prices of essential commodities like onion, potatoes and cooking oil also registered a significant decline compared to the same period last year.

6,"Reforms offset Pakistan’s surging external risks, says Fitch Ratings","Says increases in global energy prices, strong domestic recovery from Covid have put additional strains on external position.","ISLAMABAD: Fitch Ratings says that Pakistan’s recent policy adjustments and demonstrated access to external financing, as well as its commitment to a market-determined exchange rate, offset rising external risks from a widening current account deficit. 
The Hong Kong-based Fitch Ratings said on Wednesday that the ongoing reforms, if sustained, could create positive momentum for the sovereign’s ‘B-‘ (B minus) rating, which it affirmed in May this year with a stable outlook. 
Referring to the staff-level agreement reached between Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Nov 21 on the sixth review of Extended Fund Facility (EFF), Fitch believes the reforms include amending the State Bank of Pakistan Act to formalise the central bank’s institutional independence and removing some tax exemptions. 
It expects that the IMF will release a further $1 billion in funding, provided certain prior actions are met. 
The authorities sustained reform efforts and commitment to the IMF programme should support access to external financing, even with global financing conditions potentially becoming more challenging for emerging markets in 2022 as global monetary policy settings grow less accommodative. 
“If the government retains its commitment to a market-driven exchange rate, we believe this would be a useful shock absorber to help contain external risks in the longer term,” says Fitch Ratings which is a leading provider of credit ratings, commentary and research for global capital markets. 
An exchange rate that supports the price competitiveness of Pakistan’s exports could over time help to reduce the country’s reliance on debt financing to balance its external accounts, which remains a credit weakness. In addition, fiscal consolidation under the EFF could help reduce external imbalances by dampening imports, while also reducing the drag of weak public finances on Pakistan’s rating, it says. 
Fitch says increases in global energy prices and a strong domestic recovery from the initial Covid-19 pandemic shock have put additional strains on Pakistan’s external position. 
The current account deficit in the financial year to June 2022 is set to be wider than the agency’s previous forecast of 2.2 per cent.

7,Trading on Growth Enterprise Market board to begin tomorrow,New counter is reserved for ‘growth companies’.,"KARACHI: With the maiden listing of Pak Agro Packaging Ltd, trading on the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) board of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) will start tomorrow (Friday). 
GEM — a newly launched counter on the PSX — is reserved for “growth companies” carrying higher investment and liquidity risks than mature companies listed on the main board of the exchange. 
The opening price of the company will be Rs24.75 per share as per the book-building process early this month in which the firm raised Rs198 million. With the trading symbol of GEMPAPL, the scrip will be quoted in the paper and board sector of the PSX. 
In addition, logistics firm Universal Network Systems Ltd that operates under the brand name of BlueEX also raised about Rs446m recently. Trading in BlueEx shares will start within two weeks on the GEM board. 
Only for accredited investors
In a separate notice on Tuesday, the PSX told individual investors that they must “self-declare” themselves as accredited investors if they want to trade in GEM-listed securities. According to the PSX rules, only institutions or accredited individual investors registered with the National Clearing Company of Pakistan Limited (NCCPL) having net assets of at least Rs5m can buy and sell stocks in the riskier companies listed on the GEM counter. 

New counter is reserved for ‘growth companies’

If an investor places a bid for a GEM-listed company without being already marked as an accredited individual, the PSX will ask the relevant broker to obtain a self-declaration. 
“If the investor is non-accredited, the [broker] will honour the transaction from its own account by rectifying the underlying trade as per the current rectification mechanism or via the NDM mechanism,” it said while referring to the off-market or negotiated-deal market trades. In simple words, shares won’t be credited to the unaccredited investor’s account even if they place the trade unwittingly. 
However, not all market analysts are happy with the preconditions notified for accredited individual investors.
“I have serious doubts about the screening process for accredited investors. Is self-declaration enough? Did the PSX explain to brokers beforehand what to do if non-accredited investors managed to buy GEM-listed securities?” said Sani-e-Mehmood Khan, an independent capital market expert who served as general manager of the PSX in the past.
“Having net assets of Rs5m doesn’t automatically make an investor sophisticated. Everyone knows how brokers convince people to invest. The regulator should’ve used a better methodology to ascertain the level of sophistication among investors,” he added. 
Topline Securities CEO Mohammed Sohail disagreed with the view that brokers lack the capacity to handle trading on the GEM board. “Brokers are already doing KYC [know-your-customer] and setting trading limits of clients based on their income and assets,” he told Dawn. 
Another broker said net assets in the NCCPL system constitute the most feasible proxy for an investor’s financial muscle. “Trading on GEM is restricted for the general public. The premise is that the accredited investor is already a UIN [unique identification number] holder and has a fair idea what the stock market is all about,” said a broker requesting anonymity.
