1,Pakistan most affected by drugs: minister,"RAWALPINDI: Pakistan, as a transit country, is the most affected by drugs and in order to eradicate this evil,...","RAWALPINDI: Pakistan, as a transit country, is the most affected by drugs and in order to eradicate this evil, society must collectively wage war against it.
These views were expressed by Minister for Narcotics Control retired Brig Ijaz Shah while addressing participants of a drug burning ceremony, held in the outskirts of Islamabad near Rawat on Wednesday. 
“It is unfortunate that anyone who appears in public after attending the proceedings of his drug case in a court of law makes a victory sign, to which people clap in response,” he added.
Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) North had organised the ceremony in Islamabad during which 18 metric tonnes of narcotics seized in various operations of ANF, Rangers, police and FC were set on fire.
ANF Director General Maj Gen Ghulam Shabir Narejo, force commander (North) Brig Ammar Ali, foreign drug liaison officers, celebrities and other students attended the ceremony.
The federal minister said in his address that the government had formulated anti-narcotics drug policy for the first time which had three tiers under which there were discussions on drug prevention and policy at the federal, provincial and district levels.
Unfortunately, in a country where flour, pulses and sugar are being smuggled, the preference for anti-narcotics naturally decreases, he said, adding that the government was trying its best to reduce the demand for drugs and its supplies.
If there is so much profit and margin in its business, then even if the whole army is deployed on the 2,000 kilometre border, the supply will increase. The only solution is to reduce the demand and work for rehabilitation of drug addicts, he said, adding the role of young people is to play their part in overcoming challenges including drug abuse, extremism and terrorism while taking Pakistan forward.
In response to another inquiry, Mr Shah said that no outside pressure was exerted on the execution process. “We pay the lawyer Rs200,000 to investigate the case, and the drug cartel pays Rs1 crore. It is a tragedy that a high-level criminal is treated with more respect,” he added.
As many as 500 more personnel are being recruited in the ANF however this is the age of technology and it should be utilised in the war against drug use.
The DG ANF and Brig Ali also addressed the gathering. Other celebrities including well known singer and social worker Shehzad Roy, artist Jamal Shah and others also hinted at playing a vital role in curbing drug trafficking in schools and colleges.

2,Senate body okays organ transplantation bill,"According to the amendment, Nadra will ask people at time of CNIC registration whether they want to donate their organs.","ISLAMABAD: Senate Standing Committee on National Health Services (NHS) on Wednesday unanimously approved ‘The Transplantation of the Human Organs and Tissues (Amendment) Bill 2021’.
According to the amendment, at the time of registration for Computerised National Identity Cards (CNIC) the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) will ask people that whether they want to donate their organs. 
If they reply in affirmative a red mark will be added to their CNICs.
The bill was tabled by Balochistan Awami Party Senator Sana Jamali and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Senator Seemee Ezdi as a private member’s bill on Sept 27 in the upper house which was referred to the Senate standing committee.
The committee chairman, Mohammad Hamayun Mohmand, while discussing the bill, said there was not a single body to register donors and receivers of human organs. He said though it was a positive practice to donate organ, its misuse should be stopped.
A representative of Human Organs Transplant Authority (HOTA) said there were 20 registered institutions, across the country, which were doing organ transplant, but public sector institutions were hardly doing transplants.
Members of the committee unanimously approved the bill and referred it to upper house for voting.
Mover of the bill Senator Sana Jamali, while talking to Dawn, said that bill suggests that at the time of issuance of CNIC the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) will ask people that if they want to donate their organs. 
“The red mark on the CNIC is aimed at keeping people and authorities informed that the CNIC holder has committed to donated organs. 
“Those who will die in the hospitals, their organs can be removed from there or relevant authorities can be intimated,” she said.
While replying to a question, Ms Jamali said that people will have a choice to include or remove donated organs from Nadra’s list.
She expressed the hope that, because of its importance, the bill would easily sail through the parliament.
Pakistani smokers who wanted to quit cigarettes remained unsuccessful.
As many as 86pc of Pakistani smokers who wanted to quit cigarettes were unsuccessful despite repeated attempts, reveals an opinion survey conducted in major cities across the country. 95pc of these Pakistanis, however, told that switching to alternatives allowed them to quit the harmful habit of smoking.
At a ceremony held in Islamabad, sharing details of the survey with media, Mirza M. Abeer, founder and CEO of Association for Smoking Alternatives Pakistan (ASAP), believes the best option is for smokers to quit, but the majority of smokers who cannot quit should at least move to safer alternatives such as e-cigarettes or heated tobacco products.
The survey was commissioned by the ASAP with over 600 smokers and users of alternatives to help understand consumer perceptions about cigarette alternatives in the country. The research was a component of anti-smoking campaign launched in early November to get 1 million Pakistanis to quit cigarettes.
“This would help a lot in reducing the number of smokers in the country,” he remarked
The survey asked the participants about the reasons for quitting smoking and all of them said that better health is one of the primary reasons for switching away from cigarettes, and 98 per cent of the participants believed their health has improved as a result of switching.

This was pointed out by the agriculture commissioner at the Chinese Embassy in Pakistan Dr GU Wenliang. He was addressing participants of an event organised in connection with the Silver Jubilee of Arid University. Educational, research and cultural activities were carried out.
Prime Minister Task Force for Gems and Jewellery Chairman Eng Gul Asghar Khan Baghoor said the university was becoming an important educational institution in Pakistan due to its quality research.
The event was attended by the vice-chancellor of the university Prof Dr Qamaruz Zaman.
While appreciating the activity, Mr Asghar said it was a commendable initiative that Arid University had organised such a seminar to draw the attention of students to entrepreneurship because only through this method, Pakistan can overcome all its problems including unemployment.
Mr Wenliang said China was trying its best to uplift Pakistan’s agricultural sector and many projects had become part of CPEC.
“China will pledge to open up its markets for Pakistani agriculture products like rice, fish etc., to facilitate Pakistan in the marketing of its Halal food products and also to provide modern agricultural technologies,” he added.
Mr Zaman said technology had made it very easy to start a business and with just a mobile phone and a few pennies you can own a business worth billions of rupees.
He said that there are many examples in the world, of places where people started their businesses in poverty and unfavourable conditions, and today these countries are counted among the richest countries in the world.
He urged students to start their own business as charity as this way they would not only be able to earn a living for themselves but would also be a source of livelihood for others.
Mr Shah said drugs are the tool of hybrid war which the enemy is using against Pakistan so it is the responsibility of every Pakistani to prevent this war.
Mr Narejo, while appreciating the activity, said the era of conventional wars is over and the enemy is now using new methods to lure and destroy the young generation of Pakistan, so it is the responsibility of all of us to save Pakistan from the nefarious tactics of the enemy.
Mr Zaman assured guests that the university was working hard towards a narcotics-free campus.
Referring to the hybrid war, he said the university administration stands by the country’s security agencies in every difficult time. Another seminar was conducted on education and empowerment of female students so they could be made aware about their rights.
Afshan Qamar, the wife of the university’s vice-chancellor, participated as chief guest along with Dr Samia Raheel Qazi, Prof Dr Farkhanda Zia from International Islamic University Islamabad and Nayla Chouhan, former ambassador of Pakistan. Dr Samia said there was a lot of scepticism about women’s rights in our society and somehow they were linked to a religion which had empowered women.
She said that Islam is the only religion in the world that gives a woman the highest respect and high status in society which is evident from the phrase “paradise is under the footsteps of a mother”.
Other speakers urged students to not put their responsibilities behind in the pursuit of their rights, adding women should pursue higher education and start their businesses or jobs as this is allowed by Islam.

4,Fafen rejects expelled member’s allegations,ISLAMABAD: Days after the government ordered investigations into the allegations of an expelled member of the Free...,"ISLAMABAD: Days after the government ordered investigations into the allegations of an expelled member of the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen), the network on Wednesday rejected the accusations, including claims of poll data fudging and secret funding for the electoral body officials.
Speaking at a press conference members of the national and executive councils of Fafen called it a conspiracy to damage Pakistan’s most credible and independent voice on the quality of elections and governance.
Members of Fafen’s national and executive councils present at the press conference included Malik Shabaz, Sungi Development Foundation; Zahid Iqbal, Samaj Development Foundation; Farman Ali, Sudhaar Society; Jan Odhano, Community Development Foundation; Ghulam Mustafa, Farmers Development Organisation; Younis Bandhani, Baanh Baeli; Shah Nasir Khisro, Integrated Regional Support Programme; Zahid Islam, Sangat Development Foundation; Anbreen Ajaib, Bedari; Ghaffar Shah, Community Awareness Raising and Advocacy Venture Around Needs; Omer Javed, Welfare Association Jared; Mohammad Yaqoob, Takhleeq Foundation; Hameedullah Kakar, Youth Organisation; Ome-e-Kulsoom, Social Youth Council of Patriots; Nazir Ahmed Ujjan, Goth Seengar Foundation; Shahid Jatoi, Sustainable Social Development Organisation; Mossarat Qadeem, PAIMAN Alumni Trust; Nasrullah, Centre for Peace and Development; Zaheer Khattak, United Rural Development Organisation and Fouzia Hanif, Community Development Programme.
Rubbishing Sarwar Bari’s charge of unauthorised engagements with the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), they said the TDEA could not incur any expense without the authorisation of its board of trustees.
Fafen members had established TDEA as an independent legal entity primarily to encourage a collective ownership in all aspects of Fafen’s programming. Mr Bari remained one of the trustees of TDEA between 2008 and 2015.
TDEA Board of Trustees approve the organisational annual budget which also includes project budgets.
The authority to approve the day-to-day activities and functions is vested in the chief executive officer (CEO), and is exercised under management policies and procedures.
Mr Bari’s insinuations that the TDEA had been “secretly” paying “huge amounts” to cover travel and accommodation expenses of ECP officials appeared to be motivated by the mala fide intent of bringing into question the integrity of a constitutional institution.
“The timing of such insinuations is a cause of concern for Fafen. The fact of matter is any engagement of TDEA with the ECP has duly been approved by the board as well as the Election Commission belying Mr Bari’s claim of secrecy and illegitimacy. Such engagements have been arranged to complement the ECP-Nadra and civil society joint campaign to enhance Women’s NIC and Voter Registration, which is being implemented by member organisations of Fafen since 2017,” the network’s members said.
Mr Bari’s Pattan Development Organisation has always been implementing such projects. All of the engagements were attended by representatives of Fafen’s member organisations including representatives of Pattan Development Organisation,” they added.
About the allegation of fabrication of 2013 general elections – National Assembly Results Analysis Report – it was stated that Mr Bari had levelled the allegation on the basis of untrustworthy sources, selective reading and deliberate oversights by intentionally ignoring the methodology of the said report that clearly stated all sources of information used in its preparation.
On allegation of misuse of funds it was stated that contrary to Mr Bari’s claims, TDEA upholds the highest standards of financial transparency and accountability. TDEA maintains all critical statutory and financial documents on its website, open to public scrutiny and its funds are regularly audited by reputed, category-A audit firms. TDEA’s annual audits and tax returns are available on its website.
On the tenure of Fafen’s Executive Council, it was explained that Fafen’s National Council in its meeting on Dec 24, 2020 had unanimously extended the tenure of the current executive council until the completion of the ongoing expansion of Fafen from a network of organisations to a network of networks.
“The fact is that Mr Bari considered the current Executive Council of Fafen as legitimate until October 14, 2021. However, when the Executive Council asked for evidence from Mr Bari to substantiate his allegations, he started to question the legitimacy of the Executive Council and levelled baseless allegations against it as well,” a member said.

Speaking to Dawn a day after the Act was approved by the federal cabinet, the special assistant to the prime minister said under the ‘Islamabad Capital Territory Local Government Ordinance 2021’, the local government representatives would have their say in local education and health sectors.
He said in the 2018 general elections, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) won all three MNA seats from Islamabad.

Says representatives to have say in education, health sectors; FDE to report to mayor; Most wings of CDA to be transferred to MCI

“In the election campaign, we made a promise with the people that a powerful local government will be introduced to resolve their issues at their doorsteps, and now we are going to hold polls after fulfilling the legal formalities,” Mr Awan said, adding that under this Act, the mayor would be directly elected and there would be around 100 neighbourhood councils, each comprising 20,000 people.
The PM’s aide said without the support and guidance of Planning Minister Asad Umar, this Act would not have been prepared and passed by the cabinet.
Under the new Act, the Federal Directorate of Education (FDE), which is a regulatory body of 423 educational institutions of Islamabad, will report to the mayor for all purposes of education.
The Act said the head of the FDE shall be appointed with the consent of the mayor and the local government will monitor and supervise primary health care.
“After the commencement of this Ordinance, within one year, all wings of Capital Development Authority shall be transferred to the MCI except …Chairman Secretariat; Planning Wing; and Estate Wing,” read the ordinance.
It stated that the administration and finance wings of the CDA would be partially transferred to the Municipal Corporation Islamabad (MCI), subject to the notification of the government in light of the Capital Development Authority Ordinance, 1960.
It further stated that the CDA shall remain the custodian of its own land bank and other land transferred by the federal government and shall develop the same as prescribed by the government or decided by the CDA Board.
The ordinance went on to say that for purposes of continuity the ongoing projects being executed or implemented through the CDA shall be completed by the civic authority.
The new Act also stated that majority of departments of the ICT administration will be devolve to the MCI, including the Labour Department, Auqaf Department, Civil Defense Department, Food Department, Zakat and Ushr Department, Agriculture Department, Livestock and Dairy Development, Water Management Department, Soil Conservation Department and Fisheries Department.

“The civil servants or who opt for such employment shall be subject to the terms and conditions of employment as may be prescribed including but not limited to their service structure, promotion and disciplinary matters. Such opting employees shall be entitled to all post-retirement benefits and emolument as per existing rules and policy,” the Act said.
It further said: “CDA shall be custodian of Master Plan of ICT approved by the government from time to time in the preview of local government Islamabad and all kinds of development works in Islamabad shall be carried out by the local government Islamabad excluding ongoing projects being executed/implemented through CDA and any such work to be carried out in CDA and other government entities’ acquired land.”
It is relevant to note here, the term of local government ended in February this year and elections were supposed to be held within 120 days. However, it could not be held on time.
The ECP, however, issued schedule for delimitation of constituencies/wards and the final list of constituencies will be published on Feb 3.

• Overseas Pakistanis can benefit from facility after one week  l  Notices being served on owners of illegal societies
ISLAMABAD: The capital administration on Wednesday started property verification to counter land-related fraud in the city.
Deputy Commissioner (DC) Mohammad Hamza Shafqaat inaugurated the Property Verification Centre (PVC) at Facilitation Centre in the DC Office.
Mr Shafqaat said PVC was a joint venture of the capital administration and Capital Development Authority (CDA), and a portal had been created having records of land and housing societies of the CDA and the capital administration. The DC also requested people to use the CityApp launched by the administration.
Overseas Pakistanis and citizens residing in other parts of the country were the main victims of land fraud committed in the capital in the name of housing societies, the DC said, adding that majority of these societies had either been declared illegal or did not fall in the jurisdiction of Islamabad.
Ghouri Town is the biggest land/housing scam in the history of the capital, the DC said, adding that it was illegal and the CDA had also mentioned it on its website but people still bought land there.
Scores of illegal housing societies’ offices had been established outside the capital so that legal action against them could be avoided, he said, adding that Section 144 of the CrPC had been imposed in Islamabad with regards to such societies.
Moreover, scores of housing societies are actually located outside the capital, but their owners claim they are in the federal capital to attract buyers, Mr Shafqaat said.
In a bid to ensure transparency in the real estate sector, the district administration has unveiled the very first PVC, which will help people in investing in real estate projects and housing schemes that had been verified by the DC Office and declared legal as per the laws of the country.
“The verification centre will allow a purchaser to check the legal status of the plot before closing a deal,” he said, adding that the centre encompassed all data provided by the DC Office which will help bring transparency in the real estate sector.
For the purpose of inquiry, a form must be filled by the purchaser and the legal status of a property will be communicated within 24 hours.
Anyone who wants to purchase land in the capital can verify it from the centre free-of-cost, the DC said, adding that after a week, overseas Pakistanis will also be able to verify the status of land before purchasing it.
Mr Shafqaat said notices were being served on owners of illegal societies. Besides, strict action has been announced against illegal, residential and commercial projects that are underway, he added.
So far, the administration has retrieved land measuring 20,000 kanals worth billions of rupees from the land mafia, he said, adding that after the Illegal Dispossession Act of 2005, session courts had the authority to get the land in illegal possession vacated.
About a dozen slums in the capital are regularised, he said, adding that residences had been constructed in Alipur Farash where 400 families from Noorpur Shahan would be settled.

Mohammad Saddiq, manager of a petrol filling station, told Dawn that stocks had finished at some stations. “People are buying extra, with majority of the people asking for a full tank,” he said.
On the other hand, people criticised the strike and said such situations created problems for road users.
Nasir Hussain, a motorcyclist in Saddar, said he wanted to purchase petrol as there were reports that the strike would start from Thursday. “I got the fuel for emergency,” he said.
Petrol stations and the government should find a solution as people will suffer because of the strike, he said, adding that after shortage of electricity and natural gas, citizens were now facing another crisis.
Nadir Malik, motorist at Airport Road, said he visited various filling stations for fuel but most were facing shortage. In the end, he had to queue up at a petrol station so that he could fill up his fuel tank, he added.
When contacted, spokesperson for Pakistan Petroleum Dealers Association said the Petroleum Division did not accept our demands and announced that they would forward the matter to the Economic Coordination Committee in the next 10 days.
He said all petrol filling stations in the country, including in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, would remain closed on Thursday and petrol would only be provided to ambulances. He ruled out any chance of cancelling the strike.
The Petroleum Division on Wednesday had announced that all petrol pumps of PSO, Shell, Total and other companies would remain open across the country on Thursday.
A statement issued by the Petroleum Division said the case to increase the margin for petrol pump owners had been sent to the Economic Coordination Committee.

10,"WWF, Engro sign agreement with govt to restore degraded forest land",The joint Forest Restoration Programme will be executed at a cost of Rs600 million.,"ISLAMABAD: The government on Wednesday signed an agreement with the World Wide Fund (WWF) for Nature, Pakistan and Engro Foundation to restore 50,000 acres of degraded forest lands.
“The private sector can play a vital role in restoring the country’s degraded forest landscape for achieving environmental and economic sustainability,” said Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam while speaking at a press conference.
The memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between WWF-P, Engro Foundation and the Ministry of Climate Change under which they would combine their efforts under a joint Forest Restoration Programme and restore 50,000 acres of degraded forest land in various parts of the country at a cost of Rs600 million.

Programme will be executed at a cost of Rs600 million

The PM’s aide said that degradation and loss of forests had already destabilised natural systems on a scale unseen in human history, adding, the world had already lost nearly half of the six trillion trees that existed on Earth before the onset of agriculture 12,000 years ago.
WWF-Pakistan would conduct the monitoring of the afforestation.
Mr Amin highlighted that collaboration and partnerships between the corporate sector and government were key to the country’s aim to conserve, restore and grow billions of trees for achieving sustainable development goals including climate resilience, food security, and access to safe drinking water and sanitation, fighting hunger, malnutrition and disease.
He regretted that despite fervent conservation programmes launched in different countries, the world continues to lose around 15 billion more trees each year due to unsustainable business practices, human production and consumption patterns, resulting in slowdown in economic growth, surging poverty, diseases, hunger, species loss and extinction.
Without conserving and restoring degraded forest landscapes and protecting, we would only jeopardise efforts including gains made so far for achieving sustainability of businesses and economies, which provide jobs and feed millions, Mr Amin said, adding that it was heartening to note that non-government and non-profit organisations, and some corporate leaders had long advocated the case for private sector engagement in forest landscape restoration.
“Now it seems to be an unprecedented window of opportunity for companies and NGOs to work together with governments to advance the world’s goals on protecting the planet, fighting poverty, hunger and loss of biodiversity,” he said, adding forests were critical to the sustainability of the planet as they sequestered carbon, regulated global temperatures and freshwater flows, recharged groundwater, anchored fertile soil and acted as flood barriers. “Forest resources harbour 80pc of the world’s terrestrial biodiversity and considered a treasure trove of innovation and a source of subsistence and survival for 350 million people.
“More than half of the annual global GDP, or $44 trillion, was potentially threatened by nature loss because business depended on nature and its services. As trees vanish, the services they offer are naturally weakened, lowering the productivity/health of soils and natural carbon sinks, diminishing the people’s access to clean drinking water, safe sanitation, food and reducing our resilience to extreme weather events,” the PM’s aide remarked.
Earlier, WWF-Pakistan Director-General Hammad Naqi Khan said that the forest landscape restoration was an important approach to restoring deforested and degraded land.
It involved bringing together people with diverse and diverging views and interests to create a plan in which both people and nature win, he added.
Engro Corporation President and CEO Ghias Khan said realising the full benefits that forests provide and the planet so dearly needs requires more than simply keeping current forests standing, a daunting goal that governments alone cannot achieve with their available scant resources.
However, he said, here we believe and understand that the corporate sector must play its role as a corporate responsibility towards environmental sustainability for restoring deforested and degraded lands across landscapes in the country.

The guest of honour at the event was Danish Ambassador Lis Rosenholm and works created by Aisha Abid Hussain, Faizan Riedinger, Ghulam Mohammad, Sabah Husain and Mohammad Ali Talpur have been put on display.
Asma Rashid Khan, founder and director of the gallery, highlighted the long association the gallery has had with some of the artists, saying, “these five acclaimed artists have exhibited internationally and have made the country proud.”
She said: “We first showcased the works of Ghulam Mohammad in 2014 when he had just graduated. He went on to win the prestigious Jameel Prize of the Victoria and Albert Museum and to date, he is the only Pakistani to have won this international award.”
“We have also exhibited the works of Aisha Abid Hussain who won the Haji Sharif award in miniature painting and those of senior artist Sabah Husain who has exhibited extensively in Japan and the UK. Mohammad Ali Talpur has also shown with us in 2014 and his work is now in the public collections of the British Museum and the Queensland Museum. Faizan Riedinger, a multi-talented artist, has done residencies and shows in Japan,” she added.
Ambassador Rosenholm said: “Art makes stronger connections between countries, between nations and between societies and I think that is key for a better world – a world with more peace, with more prosperity. For that to happen we need more exchange of ideas, different ways of thinking, much more understanding of each other, much more compassion and empathy. Art is a very important means towards that end.”
She added, “As we become more creative, we broaden our minds and we have better understanding of other people. I think art is so important for that and that is why I am so happy to attend this evening. Walking around I see all this beautiful art and I have heard all these interesting stories, because for me it is always about the people behind the art – who are they, what are they trying to achieve and what are the ideas they would like to start thinking about. I am honoured to be here and also to have the opportunity to support the vibrant Pakistan art community.”
Aisha Abid Hussain’s work has an archival quality; she uses mixed media to develop a narrative that is woven out of images, documents, scripts, photographs and text. Faizan Riedinger attempts to capture and encapsulate movement, rhythm and vibrations inspired from abstraction within nature, texture, organic structures and the presence of fluidity within scripts.
Ghulam Mohammad used language and script as a medium of expression of both his own identity and cultural, historical and contemporary context. His works are intricate collages of paper cuttings of Urdu text and other local scripts pasted on wasli-paper, sometimes embellished with gold and silver leaf and Iranian ink. Mohammad Ali Talpur has taken the essential elements of calligraphy and redefined its components to create a new language.
Sabah Husain was present at the event to share her work with visitors. She is the founder and current director of Lahore Arts Foundation Trust (LAFT) and from 2000 to date and a member of the adjunct faculty at the Department of Fine Arts at National College of Arts (NCA) Lahore. While she said that her works spoke for themselves, she uses trees and plants as symbols that transcend cultures and time.
The collection was curated by Zahra Khan.
Anusheh Rehman, an educationist, said, “I enjoy attending such exhibitions as I get new ideas to try with my students. I particularly like the work drawing on calligraphy.”
Salma Basri said: “One of the biggest problems in Pakistan is that we do not give enough importance to artists. It is so important to teach people art and make art accessible to common people.”
Zille Huma said: “I’m not an artist but I try to attend as many exhibitions as I can because I find them inspiring. In the pandemic I have been learning different techniques from social media but I get the ideas and concepts from such shows.”

She received the award during the International Interfaith Peace Conference in Islamabad which was organised by the Interfaith Council for Peace and Harmony and Majlis Ulema-e-Pakistan and attended by representatives of various religions.
“It was an honour and a pleasure to receive today this international peace award from the President of Pakistan Dr Arif Alvi at the excellent International Interfaith Peace Conference which was convened by Maulana Azad of Badshahi Mosque and the President of Pakistan,” wrote Ms Kaminara on her official Twitter handle after receiving the award.

Speaking at the conference, Ms Kaminara had said that interfaith harmony was needed for the world’s future and required a constant struggle by nations. 
She mentioned that the EU Charter and the UN convention, of which Pakistan is a signatory, stressed freedom of religion.
Addressing the participants of the conference titled ‘Respect of humanity and its importance’, President Alvi declared that the interfaith harmony was the need of the hour and said Pakistan was promoting the message of tolerance and affinity among people of different faiths to make the world a peaceful place to live.
The president mentioned that several challenges such as global warming and environmental degradation required no religious intent, but a joint action to save the world and mankind.
Grand Imam Badshahi Mosque and Chairman Ruet-e-Hilal Committee Maulana Abdul Khabir Azad also spoke at the conference.
