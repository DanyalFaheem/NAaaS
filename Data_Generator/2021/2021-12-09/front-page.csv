0,Dollar  hits new record at Rs177.44,The US dollar has appreciated by 14.17 per cent since May and 11.21pc during the current fiscal year.,"KARACHI: The US dollar further appreciated to set a new record against the local currency on Wed­nesday, reflecting that nothing could stop the bullish dollar from moving ahead despite fresh $3 billion inflow from Saudi Arabia.  
Currency dealers in the inter-bank market traded the dollar under high demand at a price never witnessed before. The dollar gained 64 paisa against the rupee to reach Rs177.44 at closing on Wednesday.  
The US dollar has appreciated by 14.17 per cent since May and 11.21pc during the current fiscal year.  
Bankers said the exchange rate did not accept the positive impact of the $3bn inflow from the Saudi government meant to keep it in the account of the State Bank of Pakistan. It has improved the foreign exchange reserves of the SBP but failed to prevent the rupee’s decline against the dollar.  
Currency experts said that initially successful negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) should have an impact on the exchange rate but the rising demand for dollars had neutralised the positive impact on the local currency.  
Moreover, both the prolonged negotiations with the IMF and $3bn inflow from Saudi Arabia also came under criticism. Tough the government did not announce the conditions attached with the IMF deal and Saudi assistance, harsh criticism coupled with negative information disputed both and the exchange rate remained in favour of the US dollar.  
“The import bill of $7.5bn in November is enough to tell the whole story about the dollar demand and exchange rate. The dollar will continue to press the local currency unless something magic happens,” said Atif Ahmed, a currency dealer in the inter-bank market.  
Bankers were not sure about the future trend of the exchange rate but said it might stop with the higher inflows of remittances, increased exports and a big cut in the import bill.  
Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance Shaukat Tarin recently said the global high prices of commodities would come down next year and this would reduce the import bill.  
The dollar traded at Rs179 in the open market which looks nightmare for the people willing to buy dollars for Umrah, travelling, education or health.  
However, exchange companies said the dollar buying had hit rock bottom mainly due to the involvement of government agencies in locating the buyers as well as the sellers. They said the volume of open market these days was not more than 10 per cent compared to what it was in normal trading days.

With the launch of Naya Pakistan Card, which covers Ehsaas Ration Programme based on a food subsidy package for low-income families, Kisan Card, Sehat Card and scholarships for students, beneficiaries of various initiatives can avail all services on the same card.  
Addressing the ceremony held at the Governor House, Prime Minister Khan said that Kamyab Pakistan scheme was also in the pipeline under which two million eligible families would receive Rs400,000 interest-free loans for self-employment, free technical education to one member of each registered family, Rs2.7 million loan for house construction and free health insurance.  
He said the proposed Kamyab Pakistan programme to be launched in the KP province would be extended to other provinces later.

Besides, the government was awarding 6.3m scholarships to students to encourage them to pursue higher education as Rs47bn had been allocated in this regard, he said.  
In order to ensure award of scholarships on merit, a special cell was being set up at the PM secretariat to collect students’ data, he announced.  
Mr Khan said that the PTI got two-thirds majority during the previous elections in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa due to development projects and reforms in different sectors. A UNDP report had also acknowledged reduction in poverty in KP during 2013-18 due to the provincial government initiatives, he added.  
On the occasion, Prime Minister Khan also distributed cheques among prayer leaders of Jamia mosques under a KP government initiative, among less privileged women under Kifalat programme and scholarship among students under the Ehsaas education programme.  
He said the Punjab government was replicating KP’s model in the health sector and would launch health insurance programme from January 1 and the entire population of the province would be covered within next three months. The government of Balochistan, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan also intended to launch the mega programme, he added.  
Appreciating the performance of National Command and Operation Centre on Covid-19, the PM said the country had effectively tackled the pandemic that severally affected supply chain across the world and caused increase in prices of petroleum, gas and food commodities. Food inflation was a global phenomenon, yet prices of essential commodities were lower than in rest of the world, he added.  
In this situation, he said the historic Ehsaas food subsidy package worth Rs120bn would benefit over 20 million families, as 30pc discount would be given on purchase of ghee, flour and pulses to the families with less than Rs50,000 monthly income.  
The PM asked Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mahmood Khan to direct parliamentarians to visit their constituencies and encourage people to register themselves for ration discount.  
He also talked about building of 10 new dams in a decade to address the problem of water scarcity and bolster food production.  
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Shah Farman, Chief Minister Mahmood Khan, federal, provincial ministers, parliamentarians, senior officers and people from different segments of society attended the ceremony.

2,"Let’s engage at opportune time, Pakistan tells US","Islamabad skips Democracy Summit as Russia, China not invited","WASHINGTON: Pakistan conveyed to the United States on Wednesday that it would like to engage with Washington on the issue of democracy “at an opportune time in the future”, indicating that it may not attend President Joe Biden’s Democracy Summit. 
More than 100 nations, including Pakistan, have been invited to the two-day virtual summit, which begins on Thursday (today). Pakistan is still on the list but the official schedule of speakers does not mention Pakistan.  
The only speaker from Pakistan is human rights activist Hina Jilani who will address a panel on elections and rule of law. 
“We value our partnership with the US which we wish to expand both bilaterally as well as in terms of regional and international cooperation,” said a statement issued by the Pakistan Foreign Office. 
“We remain in contact with the US on a range of issues and believe that we can engage on this subject at an opportune time in the future.” 

Islamabad skips Democracy Summit as Russia, China not invited

The US invitation had put Pakistan in a difficult spot. Washington invited Taiwan, instead of Beijing, to represent China at the summit. Russia, another major world power, was also kept out. China is Pakistan’s closest ally while Islamabad is trying to improve its ties with Moscow as well. 
Policymakers in Islamabad are worried that not attending the summit would give India a free hand, which already has a strong influence in the US. But a strong Chinese reaction to the US decision to invite Taiwan made it obvious that attending the summit could seriously damage Islamabad’s relations with Beijing, a risk Pakistan could not take. 
In a recent statement, China’s Foreign Ministry said it was “firmly opposed” to the invitation.  
“US actions only go to show democracy is just a cover and a tool to advance its geopolitical objectives, oppress other countries, divide the world and serve its own interests,” Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said. 
The Pakistani statement, however, tries to placate Washington, thanking it for the invitation and reminded US policymakers that “Pakistan is a large functional democracy” with an independent judiciary, vibrant civil society, and a free media. “We remain deeply committed to further deepening democracy, fighting corruption, and protecting and promoting human rights of all citizens,” it added. 
The statement assured Washington “Pakistan will continue to support all efforts aimed towards strengthening dialogue, constructive engagement, and international cooperation for the advancement of our shared goals.” 
At a Tuesday afternoon news briefing, US Under Secretary of State for Democracy and Human Rights Uzra Zeya said the Biden administration had invited Pakistan and some other states to the summit to reach out “to a regionally diverse” set of democracies.  
“Our goal was to be as inclusive as possible within logistical constraints and also to ensure that all relevant views and viewpoints could be represented,” she claimed. 
Earlier this week, a US think-tank, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said in a report that the invitation was “presumably for strategic reasons” as the US relied on Pakistan for counterterrorism cooperation in the region. 
“If the Biden administration is serious about democratic revival in South Asia, it should confront India on its deteriorating democratic character and poor human rights record, especially in Kashmir,” the report added. 
The report suggested keeping Pakistan on the democracy list while encouraging it to “restore genuine democracy through a free and fair election or risk being shunned by the United States and its democratic allies.” 
It noted that the summit aimed at building a “coalition of Indo-Pacific democracies to counter China” made it difficult for Pakistan to attend.

3,India’s defence chief among 13 killed in air crash,Pakistan’s top military officers offer condolences,"COONOOR (India): Indian defence chief Gen Bipin Rawat was among 13 people killed in a helicopter crash on Wednesday, raising questions over the future of military reforms he was leading.  
Rawat was India’s first chief of defence staff, a position that the government established in 2019, and was seen as close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.  
The 63-year-old general was travelling with his wife and senior officers in the Russian-made Mi-17 chopper, which crashed near its destination in southern Tamil Nadu state.  
Modi said Rawat was an outstanding soldier and “true patriot” who had helped modernise the country’s armed forces. “His passing away has saddened me deeply,” he wrote on Twitter.  
Footage from the crash showed a crowd of people trying to extinguish the fiery wreck with water buckets while a group of soldiers carried one of the passengers away on an improvised stretcher.  
Rawat was headed to the Defence Services Staff College (DSSC) to address students and faculty from the nearby Sulur air force base in Coimbatore.  

Pakistan’s top military officers offer condolences  

The chopper was already making its descent at the time of the crash and came down around 10 kilometres from the nearest main road, forcing emergency workers to trek to the accident site, a fire official said.  
An eyewitness at the scene said he had seen passengers falling from the helicopter before the crash, and that one person had crawled out from the wreckage.  
The sole survivor, a captain working at the DSSC, was being treated for his injuries at a nearby military hospital, the air force said.  
Rawat came from a military family with several generations having served in the Indian armed forces. He joined the army as a second lieutenant in 1978 and had four decades of service behind him, having commanded forces in occupied Kashmir and along the Line of Actual Control bordering China.  
Rawat was chief of the 1.3 million-strong army from 2017 to 2019 before his elevation to the post of defence services chief, which analysts said was aimed to improve coordination between the army, navy and air force.  
He was credited with supervising a cross-border counter-insurgency operation into neighbouring Myanmar. He was also a polarising figure whose willingness to make political statements put him at odds with the military’s traditional neutrality in a democracy.  
He was considered close to the Modi government and turned heads last month when he reportedly made an approving reference to “lynching terrorists” in the occupied territory of Kashmir.  
The Mi-17 helicopter, which first entered service in the 1970s and is in wide use by defence services around the world, has been involved in a number of accidents over the years.  
Fourteen people died in a crash last month when an Azerbaijani military Mi-17 chopper went down during a training flight.  
India’s air force said an inquiry was under way into Wednesday’s accident.  
Pakistan military 
Top officers in Pakistan’s military, including the heads of the army, air force and navy, expressed sympathy over the death of Gen Rawat and 12 other people in the helicopter crash in Tamil Nadu state. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) Gen Nadeem Raza also offered condolences on the incident.  
In a tweet, director general of the Inter-Services Public Relations said: “General Nadeem Raza, CJCSC, & General Qamar Javed Bajwa, COAS, express condolences on tragic death of #CDS General #BipinRawat, his wife and loss of precious lives in a helicopter crash in India.”  
A Pakistan Air Force press release quoted Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu as condoling the deaths of Gen Rawat, his spouse, and 11 other passengers or crewmembers in the helicopter crash.  
Chief of the Naval Staff Pakistan Navy Admiral Muhammad Amjad Khan Niazi expressed similar sentiments in a tweet.

4,ECP puts off delimitation for LG polls in Sindh,Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah has sought two weeks’ time for legislation with consensus.,"ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has decided in principle to put off the delimitation process for local government elections in Sindh at the request of the chief minister, informed sources told Dawn.  
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, who met Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja here on Wednesday, sought two weeks’ time for legislation with consensus.  
ECP member from Sindh Shah Mohammad Jatoi and senior officials of the commission were also present on the occasion. The ECP member from Balochistan is away and could not attend the meeting.  
The commission promised to seriously consider the request. An informed source, however, said a decision in principle had been taken to accept the request. He disclosed that practically delimitation for LG polls in Sindh would now commence from January 1. The ECP had previously announced that delimitation would start from December 1.  
The development comes following Sindh Governor Imran Ismail’s refusal to give his assent to the Sindh Local Government Bill, returning it to the Sindh Assembly for reconsideration. The governor confirmed this while appearing on a private news channel on Monday night, describing the recently passed bill as a move to make the local government a ‘toothless’ system run by a ‘dummy’ mayor.  
The chief minister’s request shows that the provincial government is now ready to suitably amend the bill to make it acceptable for all.  
Meanwhile, the ECP on Wednesday deferred a briefing by its director general (law) on the foreign funding case against the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf because of the absence of the commission’s member from Balochistan.  
Informed sources said the commission discussed other agenda items concerning local government elections, door-to-door voters’ verification drive and other ongoing activities, but put off the briefing on the foreign funding case.  
The ECP was supposed to look into the report submitted by its scrutiny committee and the DG law, who also heads the committee, was scheduled to give a briefing to the commission.  
According to an official, the meeting is most likely to take place in next two days.
