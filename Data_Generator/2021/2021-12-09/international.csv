0,"France releases Khashoggi suspect, admits identity mistaken",Saudi embassy had said “Khalid al-Otaibi” was a common name in the country and arrested man “has nothing to do with the case”.,"PARIS: French authorities said on Wednesday they had released a man arrested on suspicion of playing a role in the 2018 Istanbul murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, after realising he was not the same individual on an arrest warrant issued by Turkey.
The man, bearing a passport in the name of Khalid al-Otaibi, was arrested by French border police at Paris’s main airport on Tuesday as he prepared to board a flight to Riyadh, police and judicial sources said.
A man named Khalid al-Otaibi is one of the 26 being tried in absentia in Turkey for being part of the hit squad that carried out Khashoggi’s murder at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. He has also been sanctioned by the US Treasury for his role in the killing.
“In-depth verifications to determine the identity of this person have enabled us to establish that the warrant was not applicable to him,” the chief prosecutor in Paris said in a statement, confirming the man had been arrested on the basis of a Turkish arrest warrant issued in November 2018. “He has been released,” the prosecutor added.
While French authorities checked his identity, the Saudi embassy in Paris issued a statement late on Tuesday saying that the man arrested  “has nothing to do with the case in question” and demanding his immediate release.
A security source in Saudi Arabia added that  “Khalid al-Otaibi” was a very common name in the kingdom, and that the al-Otaibi the French thought they were holding was actually serving time in prison in Saudi Arabia along with  “all the defendants in the case”.
No Saudi official has ever faced justice in person in Turkey for the killing, with all the suspects there tried in absentia.
The murder sparked international outrage that continues to reverberate, with Western intelligence agencies accusing the kingdom’s de-facto ruler Prince Mohammed bin Salman of authorising the killing.
Media rights body Reporters Without Borders (RSF) had called Tuesday’s arrest  “excellent news” and said it previously had filed a legal complaint with Paris prosecutors against the suspect al-Otaibi for murder, torture and enforced disappearance in October 2019. RSF said it had maintained  “complete confidentiality” about the complaint in order to improve the chances of his arrest during any visit to France.
Saudi Arabia has always insisted that the legal process it carried out into the Khashoggi killing has been completed and there is no need for any further arrests.
“The Saudi judiciary has issued verdicts against all those who took part in the heinous murder of Jamal Khashoggi, all of them are currently serving their sentences,” the Paris embassy said.
In September 2020, a Saudi court overturned five death sentences issued after a closed-door trial in Saudi Arabia, sentencing the accused to 20 years in prison instead.
Khashoggi — a prominent Saudi who lived in self-exile in the United States and wrote for The Washington Post — entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2, 2018 to file paperwork to marry his Turkish fiancee.

1,20 get death sentences for murdering student in BD,DHAKA: Bangladesh sentenced 20 university students to death on Wednesday for the 2019 murder of a young man who...,"DHAKA: Bangladesh sentenced 20 university students to death on Wednesday for the 2019 murder of a young man who criticised the government on social media. 
The battered body of Abrar Fahad, 21, was found in his dormitory hours after he wrote a Facebook post slamming Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for signing a water-sharing deal with India. 
He was beaten with a cricket bat and other blunt objects for six hours by 25 fellow students who were members of the ruling Awami League’s student wing, the Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL). 
“I am happy with the verdict,” Fahad’s father Barkat Ullah told reporters outside court after the sentencing. “I hope the punishments will be served soon.” 
The remaining five perpetrators were handed life terms. 
All those given death sentences were between 20 and 22 years old at the time of the murder and attended the elite Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology alongside Fahad. Three of the defendants are still at large while the rest were in the courtroom. 
Faruque Ahmed, a lawyer for some of the defendants, said the sentence would be appealed.  “I am very disappointed at the verdict. It is not fair,” he said. 
“They are young men and some of the best students of the country. They were sentenced to death despite no proper evidence against some of them.” 
Fahad had put up a post on Facebook that went viral hours before his death. In it, he criticised the government for signing an accord that allowed India to take water from a river that lies on the boundary the two countries share. 
Fahad had been seen — in leaked CCTV footage that went viral on social media — walking into a dormitory with some BCL activists. About six hours later, his body was carried out by the students and laid on the ground. 
Protests in the days after Fahad’s murder called for the attackers to be harshly punished and for the BCL to be banned. 
Sheikh Hasina vowed soon afterwards that the killers would get the “highest punishment”. 
The country’s justice minister, Anisul Huq, said the verdict showed that “nobody will be able to walk freely after committing such crimes”. 
Chhtra Odhikhar Parishad, a leading student group, held a demonstration to praise the verdict and demand quick execution of the death sentences. 
“The verdict is the victory of the people,” said Akram Hossain, the group’s general secretary. 
The BCL has earned notoriety in recent years after some of its members were accused of killing, violence and extortion. In 2018, its members allegedly used violence to suppress a major anti-government student protest. Those rallies were sparked by anger over road safety after a student was killed by a speeding bus. 
Death sentences are common in Bangladesh with hundreds of people on death row. All executions are by hanging, a legacy of the British colonial era. 
In August, a court sentenced six Islamist extremists to death for the murders of two gay rights activists. 
Sixteen people were handed the death penalty in 2019 for burning alive a 19-year-old student who accused her seminary’s head teacher of sexual harassment.

2,Myanmar soldiers accused of killing 11 opponents after charred remains found,"“The troops were just brutally killing anyone they could find,” a volunteer said, citing witness accounts.","YANGON: Myanmar soldiers have been accused of rounding up 11 people in a village in a central area of the strife-torn country before shooting them and setting fire to their bodies, according to residents in the area and media reports.
The charred remains were found in a village in Sagaing, an area which has seen fierce fighting between security forces and militia set up by opponents of military rule since a Feb 1 coup, said residents, who said some of the victims were still alive when burned.
Video footage purporting to show the burned bodies was circulated on social media and images were published by some media including the Myanmar Now news portal. A volunteer aid worker in the area said by telephone troops had entered Don Taw village early on Tuesday and the victims were killed at around 11am that day.
“The troops were just brutally killing anyone they could find,” the volunteer said, citing witness accounts. The volunteer has assisted people who have fled Don Taw and other nearby villages. The volunteer said it was unclear if the victims were militia members or ordinary civilians.
Myanmar has been in chaos since the military overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi’s democratically elected government, with widespread protests and the formation of militia, known as People’s Defence Forces (PDF), to take on the well-equipped army.
Kyaw Wunna, a member of a PDF in the region, said by telephone he was informed that troops had arrived firing weapons and those detained were taken to a field near the village before being killed. Kyaw Wunna declined to disclose the source of the information.
Another volunteer aid worker said they had spoken to witnesses among some of the 3,000 people who had fled from five villages in the area and had gone into hiding, fearful of more arrests and killings.
A relative of one of the victims said the dead man, Htet Ko, was a 22-year-old university student and not a member of any militia and not armed.
“This is inhumane. I feel deep pain in my heart,” said the relative, who said the man had tried to flee, but had been wounded by gun fire.
Dr Sasa, a spokesperson for Myanmar’s shadow civilian government set up following the coup, alleged the victims had been  “lashed together, tortured, and ultimately burned alive”.
In a post on social media, he listed what he said were the names of the 11, all male and including a boy of 14. “These horrific attacks show that the military have no regard for the sanctity of human life,” he said.
The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), a monitoring group cited by the United Nations, says more than 10,700 civilians have been detained and 1,300 killed by security forces since the military seized power.
The military says AAPP is biased and uses exaggerated data and that hundreds of soldiers have also been killed.

3,Germany gets new chancellor after 16 years of Merkel,PM Imran congratulates Scholz on assuming the high office.,"BERLIN: Social Democrat Olaf Scholz was sworn in as German chancellor on Wednesday, ending Angela Merkel’s 16 years of conservative rule and paving the way for his coalition government that has promised to boost green investment and strengthen European unity. 
Scholz, 63, who over the past four years served as vice chancellor and finance minister in coalition with Merkel, won a majority of 395 votes from lawmakers in the lower house of parliament, Bundestag President Baerbel Bas said. 
After being formally nominated by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier in the nearby Bellevue Palace, Scholz returned to the historic Reichstag building in the heart of the German capital to take the oath of office in front of lawmakers and become Germany’s ninth chancellor since the end of World War Two. 

Imran congratulates Scholz on assuming the high office

Scholz swore to devote his energies to the welfare of the German people — but he did not ask for God’s help, a phrase that is usually included in the oath of office and was spoken by Merkel. 
In the afternoon, Merkel officially handed over the chancellery to Scholz and wished him a “steady hand” as the country faces a brutal fourth wave of coronavirus infections and challenges to its democratic order from authoritarian leaders. 
In a short speech, Scholz hailed Merkel as a great chancellor and thanked her for a close and trustful relationship over the past years. 
“I would like to build on the north-east German mentality, if I may say so, that has reigned here so far. Not much will change it this regard,” Scholz said in reference to their shared northern roots in the port city of Hamburg. 
With his down-to-earth and no-nonsense manner, Scholz has positioned himself as Merkel’s natural successor and a safe pair of hands to steer Germany through challenges ranging from tackling the climate crisis to dealing with a more confrontational Russia and increasingly assertive China. 
Scholz will lead an unprecedented three-way ruling coalition on the federal level with the pro-spending, environmentalist Greens and the fiscally more conservative, libertarian Free Democrats (FDP) — unlikely political bedfellows in the past. 
Scholz is an experienced negotiator and veteran politician who as SPD party secretary general from 2002 until 2004 defended controversial labour market reforms and social welfare cuts under former Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. 
As labour minister from 2007 to 2009 in Merkel’s first ruling coalition, Scholz pushed for a generous short-time work scheme that helped protect millions of workers from the fallout of the global financial crisis. 
After being mayor of Hamburg from 2011 to 2018, he returned to Berlin as Merkel’s finance minister — a role in which he got rid of the goal of balanced budgets and enabled record new borrowing to shield companies and employees from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. 
On the European level, he worked closely with France and persuaded Merkel to support a debt-financed European Recovery Fund worth $900 billion to help EU member states hit hardest by Covid-19.

Prime Minister Imran Khan congratulated Scholz on assuming the high office and said he looked forward to working with him on strengthening ties between the two countries, added our staff reporter. 
“Warm felicitations to Olaf Scholz on assuming the Office of the Chancellor,” he wrote in a tweet. “I look forward to working with Chancellor Scholz on further deepening and strengthening the long-standing multifaceted partnership between Pakistan & Germany,” Mr Khan said.

4,Russian rocket carrying Japanese billionaire docks with ISS,The journey aboard the three-person Soyuz spacecraft took just over six hours.,"BAIKONUR: A Russian rocket carrying a Japanese billionaire docked with the International Space Station on Wednesday, marking the country’s return to space tourism after a decade-long pause that saw the rise of competition from the United States.
Online fashion tycoon Yusaku Maezawa and his assistant Yozo Hirano blasted off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan earlier on Wednesday.
They docked with the Poisk module of the Russian segment of the ISS at 1340 GMT, the Russian space agency said. “We have contact,” Roscosmos tweeted.

 



 
Their journey aboard the three-person Soyuz spacecraft piloted by cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin took just over six hours, capping a banner year that many have seen as a turning point for private space travel.
Billionaires Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson all made breakthrough commercial tourism flights this year, bursting into a market Russia is keen to defend.
A crowd at the launch site — including Maezawa’s family and friends — braved freezing temperatures and cheered as the rocket blasted off into the grey sky, leaving a trail of orange flames before disappearing in the clouds. “This has been a long process. It’s so moving. I was about to cry,” said Ryo Okubo, a lawyer for Maezawa’s space projects.
“I’m really excited but he’s also my friend so I’m worried about him,” a longtime friend of the billionaire, 44-year-old Hiroyuki Sugimoto, said. Among the revellers was a family-of-three who won spots at the launch from out of a million applicants. The brother and sister were holding hand-drawn banners with Maezawa’s face inside a sunflower and a picture of a rocket.
The trio will spend 12 days on the station where the Japanese tourists will document their daily life aboard the ISS for Maezawa’s popular YouTube channel.

5,UK PM apologises for staff joking about Christmas party,"Disciplinary action will be taken if it was found that rules had been broken, he says.","LONDON: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson apologised on Wednesday after a video surfaced showing his staff laughing and joking about a party in Downing Street during a Christmas Covid-19 lockdown last year when such festivities were banned.
Hours later the main aide featured in the video, Johnson’s press secretary at the time, Allegra Stratton, resigned as an adviser to the prime minister. In a tearful statement, she said she would regret the remarks she made in the video for the rest of her days.
For more than a week, Johnson and his team have repeated that no rules were broken late last year after the Mirror newspaper reported there had been several parties,  including a wine-fuelled gathering of 40 to 50 people, to mark Christmas.
On Wednesday, Johnson told parliament that he was furious about the video, which was first shown by ITV late on Tuesday, but said he had been repeatedly assured that no party took place at Downing Street, his office and official residence.
Opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer accused Johnson of “taking the public for fools”, while Ian Blackford of the Scottish National Party told Johnson to resign.
It is the latest misstep by an administration which has been criticised over its handling of a sleaze scandal, the awarding of Covid contracts, the refurbishment of Johnson’s Downing Street apartment and the chaotic evacuation from Afghanistan.
“I apologise unreservedly for the offence that it has caused up and down the country, and I apologise for the impression that it gives,” Johnson told parliament.
Disciplinary action would be taken if it was found that rules had been broken, he said.
“But I repeat ... that I have been repeatedly assured since these allegations emerged, that there was no party and that no Covid rules were broken.”  
He also pledged to “get on with the job”, accusing the opposition of trying to “muddy the waters about events or non-events of a year ago”.
After days of denials, the video aired by ITV showed Stratton at a Downing Street rehearsal for a daily briefing on Dec 22 last year, during which she laughed and joked about a reported Christmas gathering.
In the video, another Johnson adviser asks Stratton: “I’ve just seen reports on Twitter that there was a Downing Street Christmas party on Friday night. Do you recognise those reports?”  
Stratton, standing before British flags at an official Downing Street lectern, says: “I went home.” 
She then laughs and smiles. “Hold on. Hold on. Um. Er. Ah.” She appears lost for words and looks up.
On Wednesday, Stratton made a tearful statement to media outside her house, saying she was resigning from her current role as Johnson’s spokeswoman for climate change.
“I understand the anger and frustration that people feel. To all of you who lost loved ones, who endured intolerable loneliness and who struggled with your businesses — I am truly sorry,” she said.
At the time of the Downing Street gathering, tens of millions of people across Britain were banned from meeting close family or friends for a traditional Christmas celebration — and even from bidding farewell to dying relatives.

6,Boris Johnson imposes Covid ‘Plan B’ in England to contain Omicron,"New measures described as a “hammer blow” for city centre restaurants, cafes and shops.","LONDON: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposed tougher Covid restrictions in England on Wednesday, ordering people to work from home, wear masks in public places and use vaccine passes to slow the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant. Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales are free to set their own restrictions.
Undermined by accusations that his staff partied at Downing Street during a Christmas lockdown last year, Johnson said Omicron was spreading rapidly and he had no choice but to move to “Plan B” while a vaccine booster programme rolls out. 
While still a long way from the full lockdowns imposed earlier in the pandemic, the new measures were described as a “hammer blow” for city centre restaurants, cafes and shops that are desperate for Christmas trade to rebuild their finances.
Many lawmakers in Johnson’s own party are also angry with the new restrictions, fearing the impact they will have after the economy shrank by a historic 10 percent last year.
“While the picture may get better, and I sincerely hope that it will, we know that the remorseless logic of exponential growth could lead to a big rise in hospitalisations and therefore, sadly, in deaths,” Johnson told a news conference.
Sterling fell sharply when news first emerged on Wednesday that ‘plan B’ measures were imminent and investors pared back their bets on a Bank of England interest rate hike next week. Johnson, who lifted most restrictions in England in July following a rapid vaccine rollout, had vowed to navigate the winter without resorting to a fourth lockdown, but had kept a so-called Plan B in reserve.
Part of those measures, such as reintroducing masks on public transport and in shops, had already been brought in, but on Wednesday Johnson said people should also now work from home.
Face masks will be required in public venues such as theatres and cinemas and a Covid pass will be mandatory for access to nightclubs and venues with large crowds.
