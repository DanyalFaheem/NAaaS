0,LNG prices fall with fewer cargoes in December,Ogra’s data shows govt could arrange only 10 LNG cargoes for current month when compared to 12 cargoes during Dec 2020.,"ISLAMABAD: Despite lower availability of spot cargoes, the basket price for imported Regasified Liquefied Natural Gas (RLNG) has come in at $12.62 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) for sale at distribution stage, almost 50pc higher than last year.
The average price for December is, however, 20pc lower when compared with $15.68 per mmBtu last month.
In a notification issued on Wednesday, the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) worked average sale price for SNGPL at $12.624 for December, down 19.5pc against $15.68 per mmBtu in November and $8.43 per mmBtu for December 2020.
Ogra said the price of RLNG was down $3.0553 per mmBtu (19.49pc) for the consumers of Sui Northern Gas Pipeline Company Ltd (SNGPL) and $3.0490 per mmBtu (19.77pc) for Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd (SSGC) in December when compared with November.
The Ogra’s data showed that the government could arrange only 10 LNG cargoes for current month when compared 12 cargoes during the same month last year, leaving a shortfall of over 200 million cubic feet per day.
The average cost of six long-term contract cargoes of Pakistan State Oil (PSO) had stood at $5.78 per mmBtu in December 2020 which increased for eight to an average of $10.11 per mmBtu in December, showing an increase of 75pc. This was despite two additional long-term cargoes at 10.2pc of Brent from Qatar against 6 cargoes under older contract at 13.37pc of Brent.
The average cost of two cargoes by Pakistan LNG Ltd came in at $9.48 per mmBtu this December when compared to six cargoes at an average of $7.06 per mmBtu in December last year.
The regulator said the provisional price of RLNG had reduced for the consumers of SNGPL to $12.6238 per mmBtu from $15.6791 in November. On the other hand, the distribution price for consumers of SSGC decreased to $12.3769 per mmBtu in December from $15.4259 mmBtu in November.
As per the Ogra notification a total of 10 cargoes are due in December, with eight cargoes coming from two long-term PSO contracts with Qatar and two are coming to PLL long-term contracts. There are two reasons for decrease in RLNG prices, which are the non-procurement of LNG under spot purchase and procurement of two cargoes from new long-term contract with Qatar at cheaper rates.
The lower import this month is due to PLL’s inability to attract even a single bid for its eight LNG (liquefied natural gas) cargoes, under the spot purchases, meant for December and January 2022 mainly due to supply constraints in the international LNG market.

1,Senate body assails inflation under IMF policies,Meeting marred by bitter exchanges between the members and strong criticism of Shaukat Tarin over his absence.,"ISLAMABAD: Amid criticism by majority members of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue over the upcoming ‘mini-budget and inflation under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) policies’, PML-N Senator Saadia Abbasi on Wednesday called for a ban on the use of imported luxury vehicles by officers of the armed forces at public expense instead of banning import of luxury items which generate substantial revenue. 
The meeting of the Senate standing committee — presided over by Senator Talha Mahmood — was marred by bitter exchanges between the members and strong criticism of Prime Minister’s Adviser On Finance & Revenue Shaukat Tarin for his absence while important issues relating to the IMF programme and upcoming mini budget were on the agenda. 
As a consequence, the committee unanimously decided to defer agenda items like briefing on economy, inflation, rising trade deficit, depreciating exchange rate, rising debt and liabilities and uncertainty in the market, the mini budget, negotiations with the IMF and its conditions and the State Bank of Pakistan’s autonomy. 
The opposition senators criticised the government policies and commitments with IMF which were resulting in ‘back-breaking inflation’ and erosion of market confidence.  
Senator Talha said the committee could have contributed positively to the upcoming supplementary budget even before it was presented in the parliament and suggested the government should ban import of unnecessary luxury items like expensive vehicles, make up material and so on. 
PPP Senator Sherry Rehman, who had a bitter clash earlier with PTI Senator Faisal Saleem Rehman over inflation and tough economic conditions, left the meeting saying she could not tolerate sexist comments. 
Senator Abbasi said the country could not be run through restrictions and bans but government policies that encourage growth, support businesses and create jobs. She said Pakistan could not afford to return to ‘restrictive regime’ while living in a global village. She said there could be difference of opinion over ‘luxury items’ as even dry fruit and imported milk also fell in that definition but when a well off person comes up with imported product also contributes to the kitty through duties and taxes. 
The ban should be on the import of luxury imports at public expense and it should be debated why officers of the armed forces and other institutions had six or seven BMWs and Mercedez-Benz in their use that were not permissible to their equivalent civil officers like secretaries, Ms Abbasi said. 
Secretary Finance Hamed Yaqoob Shaikh told the committee that he had joined the Ministry of Finance only a couple of days back and the supplementary budget was necessitated by the stimulus package provided by the government to negate the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and hence some policy adjustments had become unavoidable. 
Senator Rehman said the government should not hide behind the Covid-19 pandemic and all these mini budget proposals were required under the IMF programme that had opened a flood gate of inflation and broken the back of common people.

2,"Steel bar prices rise to Rs197,500 per tonne","There has been a massive rise in construction cost from Nov 2020 when steel bar was available at Rs110,000-113,000 per tonne.","KARACHI: Steel bar makers have further  increased the prices by Rs2,000 per tonne citing persistent rupee devaluation, rising costs of energy and inputs and supply  chain disruptions.
As per letters issued by various steel bar  makers to the construction sector, Amreli Steels Ltd said effective Dec 7 the new  ex-factory booking rates of (9.5/10mm and 12mm) are Rs197,500 per tonne  and 16mm and above sizes at Rs195,000 per tonne (deform and extreme  rebars).
Naveena Steel Mills has quoted Rs194,500 for 16-32mm and  Rs196,500 per tonne for 10-12mm sizes respectively for the deformed  grade-60.
The new rates of Faizan Steel are Rs196,500 for 10-12mm per tonne and Rs194,500 per tonne for 16-25mm sizes.
There  has been a massive rise in the construction cost from Nov 2020  when steel bar was available at Rs110,000-113,000 per tonne as  compared to current Rs197,500 per tonne.
Pakistan Association of Large Steel Producers secretary general Syed Wajid I. Bukhari said an unprecedented increase in the cost of steel  scrap globally, record freight charges, massive rupee devaluation, rising cost of gas, electricity and fuel have led to massive price hikes in the domestic market. 
The State Bank of Pakistan’s move to increase the interest rate to 8.75pc, which is one of the highest in the region, would not only increase the cost  of doing business further high but dent any  opportunity of growth within the sector, he said.
After facing crisis in FY19 and FY20, the fragile steel industry was looking  to rebound but could not achieve any real growth due to supply  chain disruptions and inflationary pressures.  According to Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) data, iron and steel scrap imports — a major raw material used for manufacturing quality graded rebars — fell year-on-year by 33pc to 1.227m tonnes in July-October period.  
He said the industry had been plagued by the continuous rupee fall hitting record low at Rs177, pushing up the import cost of raw materials.
A record rupee  devaluation would directly result in an increase of over Rs9,000 per  tonne. The energy cost, a vital cost component for steel making, is  double to that of the regional peers. 
Industrial unit effective price in  Pakistan ranges between 12.28¢/kWh-16.14¢/kWh, whereas in Vietnam  (7.3¢/kWh), India (6.1¢/kWh and 6.8¢/kWh in Maharashtra and Punjab) and at 6.1¢/kWh in China.

To support Pakistan’s drive for mass vaccination, Chinese companies supplied Covid-19 vaccine on priority basis. The government of China provided over four million doses of vaccine to Pakistan free of cost.  
The minister highlighted that Pakistan and China were entering the next phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor in which special economic zones were being established.

Secretary Finance Hamid Yaqoob Shaikh updated the NPMC that prices of wheat flour bags remained consistent at Rs1,100 per 20 kg due to the proactive measures of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa governments and the Islamabad Capital Territory administration. The daily release of wheat by all the provincial governments will further ease out wheat prices at national level, the committee was informed. 
Secretary National Food Security Ghufran Memon apprised the meeting that sufficient wheat stocks were available and the market has witnessed stability due to regular and effective monitoring of wheat movement. The stocks are released accordingly, he added.

5,Urea flow from Punjab to Sindh draws panel’s ire,Minister directs authorities to ensure vigilant border monitoring to avoid interprovincial movement of urea.,"ISLAMABAD: The Fertiliser Review Committee censured the agriculture departments of Sindh and Punjab on Wednesday for not containing the flow of fertiliser into Sindh. 
The committee’s meeting — jointly chaired by Minister for Industries and Production Makhdum Khusro Bakhtyar and Federal Minister for Food Security Syed Fakhar Imam — was held to review the supply, stock position and production targets of urea in the current month for the sowing season.  
Mr Bakhtyar directed the authorities concerned to ensure vigilant border monitoring to avoid interprovincial movement of urea and rationalise district-wise provision of urea for a market correction. 
Sindh’s agricultural department officials informed the meeting about the recent illegal movement of urea at the Sukkur bypass and the highway at the border with Punjab. The officials said Sindh had initiated punitive measures against hoarders in the area surrounding the provincial border. 
The meeting was informed that the actions by the Sindh government through the relevant district administration seized urea bags that were illegally stored at the Sukkur bypass. 
Mr Bakhtyar directed fertiliser manufacturers to blacklist dealers who were hoarding and black-marketing urea. 
While the officials of the Ministry of Industries and Production called upon the fertiliser manufacturers to stop hoarding and oversupply of urea in Karachi, the private sector inquired about the notifications by the provincial governments or district administrations regarding the ban on urea movement. 
The meeting was informed by Punjab’s agriculture secretary that urea supplies to Punjab had increased from 64 per cent to 72pc as anomalies in distribution among the provinces had been rectified. 
The forum also reviewed the supply and stock position and production targets of urea in the current month. 
The meeting was told that urea prices had been restored to the controlled rates of Rs1,768 per bag amid stern measures in Punjab, while the pricing structure was being maintained in other provinces.  
As the meeting discussed the factors leading to the black marketing of urea and higher purchases during the ongoing Rabi season, the representatives of fertiliser manufacturers informed the committee that the price range was between Rs1,790 and Rs1,950 per bag in various parts of the country.

6,TeleCard lands Rs100m SBP cybersecurity contract,KARACHI: TeleCard Ltd has been awarded an IT and cybersecurity contract by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) ...,"KARACHI: TeleCard Ltd has been awarded an IT and cybersecurity contract by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) amounting to Rs100 million, a stock filing said on Wednesday. 
“This contract involves supply, installation, maintenance and technical support of next generation Intrusion Detection and Protection Systems (IDPS) to secure the SBP’s infrastructure from Advance Persistent Threats,” it said. 
TeleCard Ltd owns 100 per cent shares of Supernet Ltd that, in turn, owns Supernet Secure Solutions Ltd, which handles the cybersecurity business on behalf of its parent company. 
Speaking to Dawn, Supernet Secure Solutions Ltd CEO Jamal Nasir Khan said the growing pace of digitisation in the country has highlighted the need for enhanced cybersecurity. “Everything is moving online, especially after Covid-19. The number of cybersecurity-related breaches has also gone up, which means companies need to invest more in their IT infrastructure,” he said. 
This IDPS solution will let the SBP detect vulnerable exploits and unidentified threats originating against any targeted system, applications or hardware. In addition, the IDPS will provide remedial measures as and when any malicious behaviour is detected. 
“This solution will operate by scanning all network traffic on the SBP’s gateways, detecting and protecting against threats like DoS, DDoS, worms and viruses... creating a second layer of defence to the SBP’s security framework,” the statement said. 
TeleCard Ltd is planning to list Supernet Ltd on the Pakistan Stock Exchange to seek “new revenue streams and create fiscal space”. The company is aiming to sell off one-quarter of its shareholding in Supernet Ltd while retaining 75pc stake post-listing. 
Effective Oct 2021, TeleCard Ltd restructured its loan as the company had raised Rs2.4 billion through a term finance certificate (TFC) a few years ago. It paid back Rs1.7bn and the end-of-September financial statements showed the outstanding TFC amounted to Rs736.2m. 
Under the restructuring terms, the principal amount is redeemable over 20 equal quarterly instalments beginning from March 2022. However, in case Supernet Ltd is listed and the proceeds from the offer are equal to or exceed Rs250m, then the three quarterly installments of the principal that immediately fall due will be paid in a bullet payment.
