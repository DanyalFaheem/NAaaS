3,Rohit replaces Kohli as ODI captain,"NEW DELHI: Opener Rohit Sharma replaced Virat Kohli as India’s ODI captain on Wednesday, thus taking charge of ...","NEW DELHI: Opener Rohit Sharma replaced Virat Kohli as India’s ODI captain on Wednesday, thus taking charge of both the white-ball squads ahead of their tour of South Africa later this month.
Kohli led India in all three formats until the ICC Twenty20 World Cup last month, after which he relinquished 20-overs captaincy which went to Rohit.
Many expected Kohli, who remains the Test captain, to lead India in the 50-overs World Cup on home soil in 2023 but the country’s cricket board opted for a single white-ball skipper.
“The All-India Senior Selection Committee ... decided to name Mr Rohit Sharma as the captain of the ODI & T20I teams going forward,” BCCI secretary Jay Shah said in a statement.
Under Kohli, India reached the semi-finals of the 50-overs World Cup in 2019 but could not advance beyond the group stage at this year’s T20 World Cup in the UAE.
In further indication of Rohit’s growing stature within the team, the 34-year-old also replaced fellow Mumbai player Ajinkya Rahane as vice-captain of the Test side.
Rahane is part of the 18-member squad that will travel to South Africa but must snap his woeful run of form to maintain his place in the side.
Beginning on Dec 26, India are scheduled to play three Tests in South Africa, followed by three ODIs.
Rohit, who was rested for the home series against New Zealand, returns to the Test side, along with fellow opener KL Rahul, first-choice wicket-keeper Rishabh Pant and fast bowlers Mohammed Shami and Jasprit Bumrah.
Opener Shubman Gill and spin-bowling all-rounders Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel missed out with injuries.
Squad: Virat Kohli (captain), Rohit Sharma (vice-captain), KL Rahul, Mayank Agarwal, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane, Shreyas Iyer, Hanuma Vihari, Rishabh Pant, Wriddhiman Saha, Ravichandran Ashwin, Jayant Yadav, Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah, Shardul Thakur, Mohammed Siraj.

4,Sajid leads Pakistan to BD series sweep in race against dying light,DHAKA: Off-spinner Sajid Khan claimed 4-86 and finished with a match haul of 12 wickets as Pakistan defied fading...,"DHAKA: Off-spinner Sajid Khan claimed 4-86 and finished with a match haul of 12 wickets as Pakistan defied fading light and broke Bangladesh’s stubborn resistance to secure an innings and eight-run victory and take the two-Test series 2-0 in Dhaka on Wednesday.  
Bangladesh were forced to follow-on after being wrapped up for 87 in the first innings — their lowest score on home soil — and were bowled out for 205 as Pakistan bowlers claimed 13 wickets on a frenetic final day of the rain-hit second Test at Mirpur’s Sher-e-Bangla Stadium.  
With the light gradually fading, Bangladesh’s last-wicket pair of Taijul Islam and Ebadot Hossain resisted for 34 balls to raise a hope of salvaging the Test.  
But Sajid broke the partnership, dismissing Taijul leg-before to help Pakistan win the game.  
“The team, the captain trusted me to do the job,” man-of-the-match Sajid said. “The plan was to go for the win, and we tried to keep it tight and bowl on one spot. The entire team gets credit for their effort.”  
Pakistan declared their first innings at 300-4 after only 63.2 overs were possible in the first three days because of rain and bad light. The third day was entirely washed out and only 6.2 overs were possible on Day 2. 
Resuming on 76-7, Bangladesh were quickly dismissed.  
Sajid struck in his first over of the morning to trap Taijul leg before for a duck before Shaheen Shah Afridi bowled Khaled Ahmed for none in the next over.  
Shakib Al Hasan was the last man dismissed when he holed out a catch to Azhar Ali at short cover off Sajid after making 33 runs, the highest in Bangladesh’s first innings. Sajid finished with 8-42, the fourth-best total by a Pakistani bowler in an innings.  
After Pakistan captain Babar Azam forced the follow-on, fast bowlers Shaheen Shah Afridi (2-31) and Hasan Ali (2-37) then got into act with the new ball, leaving Bangladesh 25-4. 
But Bangladesh raised a bit hope as Mushfiqur Rahim and Liton Das combined for 73 runs in 25 overs before Sajid rattled the stump of Liton for 45.  
Shakib joined Mushfiqur and added 49 runs before the latter was run out for 48 after trying for a risky single.  
Shakib and Mehidy Hasan then frustrated the Pakistani attack with a 51-run partnership for the seventh wicket. But Bangladesh’s hopes were dashed when Babar came to bowl and got the breakthrough with his off-spin as Mehidy went for sweep and was trapped leg-before.  
“I felt that I needed to bowl at that stage and really happy I got that wicket,” said Babar of his maiden Test wicket.   
Sajid then broke through the defence of Shakib in the next over to bowl him out. He also took the final two wickets when the light started dimming, which prevented Pakistan’s fast bowlers from bowling at the tail-enders.  
“Our batsmen and especially openers gave us a good start and our mindset was just to dominate despite the bad weather,” Babar added.  
“And the way Sajid bowled, that brought us into the game and gave us momentum. The ground staff prepared the wicket very well and covered the ground and ensured we got enough time for the result, I really appreciate their efforts.”  
Shakib was his side’s top second-innings scorer with 63, becoming only the sixth player to complete a double of 4,000 runs and 200 wickets in Tests. He’s the fastest to achieve the feat, in 59 Tests to eclipse the mark of England’s Ian Botham of 69.

“It was a disappointing performance, particularly our batting. There’s no excuse. We batted poorly,” Bangladesh captain Mominul Haque said.  
“In the second innings we had an opportunity to play better than the first. The top four were not good. We lost seven wickets in one session on the fourth day. We are making the same mistakes again. It was tough to bat out there but although some of our senior players played well, we couldn’t hang on.”  
It was Bangladesh’s 93rd Test loss in 123 matches, with 44 of them coming by an innings margin.  
Pakistan opener Abid Ali was adjudged player of the series for his tally of 263 runs in three innings.  
Pakistan won the first Test in Chittagong by eight wickets. They finished the tour unbeaten, having won the preceding three-match Twent20 series 3-0.

5,Mitchell Starc’s first-ball strike delivers Harmison moment in Ashes opener,The left-arm paceman tore off around the field celebrating wildly with his teammates as the Brisbane crowd roared its approval.,"BRISBANE: Mitchell Starc gave Australia the perfect start to the Ashes series with a wicket from the first ball on Wednesday, handing England fans a Gabba moment to rank alongside Steve Harmison’s opening delivery of the 2006-7 series.
Starc delivery was as good as Harmison’s was poor, a full yorker which went behind the legs of England opener Rory Burns and swung into the base of his stumps to send the bails flying.
The left-arm paceman tore off around the field celebrating wildly with his team mates as the Brisbane crowd roared its approval.
“That’s Ashes cricket isn’t it? It’s just a heightened sense of everything,” Starc told Channel 7. “To kick-start an Ashes series, I’d say there was a fair bit of emotion going on out there.”
It was vindication for Starc, whose place in Australia’s much-vaunted pace attack was called into question in the run-up to the series.
He has always taken early wickets, though, famously removing New Zealand danger man Brendon McCullum with the fifth ball of the 2015 World Cup final.
“It’s no secret that the way I go about my bowling is to be attacking,” added the 31-year-old, who finished the day with figures of 2-35.
“A yorker is a big part of my game, but for me it’s trying to bowl fast and swing it and attack those stumps. Had a bit of luck there to get him around his legs, but was nice to see the ball swinging and get in the right spot to start the day.”
It was the second time a wicket had fallen on the first delivery of an Ashes series.
In 1936, Australia’s Ernie McCormick had Stan Worthington caught behind at the same ground to give Don Bradman the best possible start to his first match as captain.
The fear for England, who slumped to 147 all out before rain washed out the rest of the day, is that such an early blow will be as series-defining as Harmison’s opening ball of the 2006 Gabba Test.
The tourists had arrived in Australia brimming with confidence after winning the Ashes in the 2005 series in England, where Harmison had been one of the home side’s best performers.
Tossed the ball to open the series, Harmison charged in and produced a delivery that ended up in the hands of skipper Andrew Flintoff at second slip. Harmison took just 10 wickets over the series as Australia blanked England 5-0 to reclaim the urn.
Australia’s Pat Cummins, who took 5-38 in his first innings as skipper, was delighted for his fellow quick.“So happy for Starcy, that’s why he opens the bowling,” he told reporters.”... everyone thinks back to Harmison so hopefully that’s the new memory now.”

6,Cummins shines as England crumble to 147 all out,"BRISBANE: England captain Joe Root won the toss, opted to bat and lost opener Rory Burns on the very first delivery...","BRISBANE: England captain Joe Root won the toss, opted to bat and lost opener Rory Burns on the very first delivery of the Ashes series, a late swinging yorker from Australia paceman Mitchell Starc. 
It set the tone for the opening day on Wednesday, which was more like open season for Australia’s pace bowling pack. England were bowled out for 147 in 51 overs, with ominous lightning and thunder cracking to the west and south of the Gabba. 
Pat Cummins took the last three wickets and finished with a five-wicket haul in his first innings as Australia captain.
Heavy rain and bad light combined to prevent any further play on Day 1. 
“Dream start really,” Cummins said. “To keep them to 150 ... tremendous start. I’m really proud of not only how everyone bowled but I thought everyone stayed really composed. Personally, it was nice to get a couple of wickets at the end to make it a five-for — it was just a really good start.” 
The overcast conditions rapidly grew more gloomy for the visitors after Starc took out Burns’ leg stump immediately. 
It was an ugly dismissal for the Surrey man, who crab-walked across his stumps and trudged off with his sixth duck of the year, an all-time record for opening batsmen. 
Within half an hour he had been joined in the dressing room by Dawid Malan (6) and Root as the metronomic Josh Hazlewood struck twice. 
Malan dangled his bat out to catch an edge and gave debut wicketkeeper Alex Carey his first test dismissal.
Root was out for a duck by a pearl of a delivery from the big quick, with David Warner leaping wide for a superb catch in the slips. 
When Cummins took his first wicket — star all-rounder Ben Stokes (5) caught low at third slip by Marnus Labuschagne four balls after the first drinks break — England were reeling at 29-4. 
Opener Haseeb Hameed defied the attack and helped England to 59-4 at lunch, but was out for 25 early in the second session when he edged a Cummins delivery that moved away off the seam and was caught by Steve Smith at second slip. 
Ollie Pope and Jos Buttler settled the innings, combining in a 50-run stand to staunch the flow of wickets before both were out in their 30s. 
Buttler played an expansive drive for his fifth boundary to reach 39 but was out next ball from Starc, edging behind to Alex Carey as England slumped to 112-6. England added six runs before Pope (35) top-edged an attempted hook and was caught by Hazlewood diving forward near the fine-leg boundary, giving all-rounder Cameron Green his first Test wicket. 
Cummins had Ollie Robinson (0) caught behind and Mark Wood (8) caught at short-leg and the stadium lights were turned on before he finished with 5-38 when he had Chris Woakes (21) caught in the deep by Hazlewood to finish off the innings. 
“The wickets of Root, who entered the game as the leading test batter in 2021, and Stokes were the keys to keeping the England total under 150,” Cummins said, “but it’s only first innings of a five Test-match series.”
It turns out, it was a good toss for Cummins to lose in his first test since replacing Tim Paine as Australia’s first fast-bowling skipper in 65 years. 
That left Root with a difficult decision to make, considering the greenish wicket at the Gabba in overcast conditions and with rain in the forecast. 
Pope said there was no reason for England to panic, and the performance couldn’t be judged until both teams had batted on the pitch. 
“We’re going to keep fighting,” he said. “We’ll come back strong and [hopefully] put a big score on second dig after knocking them over.” 
For the first time since 1936, a wicket fell on the first ball of the Ashes series Down Under. England lost a wicket first ball at the Gabba in ‘36 and slumped to 20-3, but recovered to win that match. 
That seems a long way off for this England lineup, given the lack of preparation caused by regular rain in recent weeks which affected their training sessions and and having to quarantine for two weeks after arriving in Australia. 
England haven’t won a Test in Australia since winning the Ashes here in 2010-11, and haven’t won a Test at the Gabba since 1986. After the first two sessions, it’ll be an uphill struggle to reverse that sequence. 
The England batters struggled to cope with the extra bounce and carry which are characteristics of the Gabba pitch, and Australia’s pace trio bowled an excellent line and length in the conditions. 
When Australia bat on Thursday, England’s bowling attack will be missing a lot of experience Stuart Broad was not included. Broad and Jimmy Anderson have a combined nine Ashes tours to Australia but are both missing the opening match, leaving Wood, Woakes and Robinson as the specialist fast bowlers and Leach as the specialist spin option. 
“I think we’ve got the skill set in our bowlers to drag this back,” Pope insisted. “We’re going to keep fighting. We don’t know how [the wicket] is going to react tomorrow.”

7,"After red cards, late goals, Atletico advance into CL last 16","LONDON: Three red cards, on-field brawls, countless chances and a flurry of late goals. A wild, win-or-bust match in...","LONDON: Three red cards, on-field brawls, countless chances and a flurry of late goals. A wild, win-or-bust match in the Champions League between FC Porto and Atletico Madrid had it all on Tuesday. 
In the end, it was Atletico celebrating a place in the last 16 of Europe’s top club competition with a 3-1 win, emerging from a three-way fight for qualification in the final round of group games. 
On a night when Ajax striker Sebastien Haller became an unlikely history-maker, Real Madrid finished top of their group, and Kylian Mbappe and Lionel Messi ran amok for Paris St Germain, much of the focus on the next-to-last night of group play was on the Group ‘B’ finale as three teams vied to be runners-up to Liverpool. 
Porto started the night in second place, a point ahead of Atletico and AC Milan, who hosted Liverpool. 
Milan wound up losing 2-1, meaning the winner of the all-Iberian match at the Estadio do Dragao would advance. It turned ugly, unsurprisingly given the stakes, with Porto having two players red-carded after Atletico had Yannick Carrasco sent off. 
Atletico were outplayed for much of the game but was opportunistic in front of goal, with Antoine Griezmann scoring the 56th-minute opener at a corner before they then had Carrasco sent off for wrestling Otavio to the ground. 
With tempers flaring, Porto were also reduced to 10 men as Wendell was sent off for elbowing Atletico’s Matheus Cunha in the neck, before their substitute goalkeeper Agustin Marchesin also saw red. 
With Porto pushing forward in search of the draw they needed to qualify, Atletico got their second goal on the break in the last minute through Angel Correa before Rodrigo De Paul scored their third in injury time. Sergio Oliveira’s penalty was a mere consolation for Porto. 
Atletico finish second in Group ‘B’, a huge 11 points behind Liverpool, who became the first English team to win all six of their group games in a single Champions League campaign by beating Milan at San Siro despite fielding a virtual reserve side. 
Milan had to win to stand a chance of going through and they went ahead midway through the first half through Fikayo Tomori.

Mohamed Salah did start for the visitors and he equalised in the 36th minute before Divock Origi — who scored a stoppage-time winner in the Premier League at the weekend — made it 2-1 10 minutes into the second half, heading in after Sadio Mane’s shot was saved. 
“It’s an exceptional performance,” said manager Jurgen Klopp. “With that many changes, the boys have to be confident enough to show how good they are. I saw so many good things tonight, it was unbelievable.” 
Milan finish bottom of the group in their first Champions League campaign since 2013-14, with Porto parachuting into the Europa League. 
MBAPPE, MESSI DOUBLES
Messi and Mbappe had some fun in PSG’s group closer. It was anything but fun for Manchester City. 
City manager Pep Guardiola selected a strong lineup for the 2-1 loss at RB Leipzig despite his team being guaranteed as the Group ‘A’ winners and in the middle of a busy domestic schedule. 
City were sloppy at the back in conceding goals to Dominik Szoboszlai and Andre Silva before having right-back Kyle Walker sent off for a rash tackle from behind on Silva, meaning the team will be missing a key defender for the first leg of the last 16. 
Riyad Mahrez scored City’s goal in a match played without fans because of coronavirus restrictions. 
Leipzig finished third to stay in European competition. 
It was a stroll for second-place PSG in a 4-1 win over Club Brugge, with Mbappe scoring twice inside the first seven minutes and — at 22 years and 352 days — becoming the youngest player to reach 30 goals in the competition. 
Messi added his own double, the first a curler from outside the area and the second a penalty, and has now scored against a record-extending 38 different teams in the Champions League. 
HISTORIC HALLER
Haller’s first season in the Champions League has been a historic one. 
By converting an eighth-minute penalty for Ajax in their 4-2 win over Sporting Lisbon, the Ivory Coast striker became only the second player — after Cristiano Ronaldo in 2017-18 — to score in all six matches of a single group stage. He finished with 10 goals in total. 
It’s quite the rise to prominence for Haller, who was sold to Ajax by West Ham in January 2020 because he was struggling to get in the English team. Then, after joining Ajax, the Dutch club accidentally omitted Haller’s name when submitting their squad for the Europa League so he couldn’t be registered for the competition. 
Brazilian duo Antony and David Neres added further goals and Steven Berghuis was also on target as Ajax, already sure of winning Group ‘C’, finished on a maximum 18 points. Sporting had already secured second place. 
Indeed, with Borussia Dortmund certain of third place before their 5-0 thrashing of 10-man Besiktas. with Donyell Malen getting the opener and Marco Reus scoring a brace before Erling Haaland came off the bench to score two headers in the second half, the last round of matches in the group didn’t affect the standings. 
REAL IN FIRST
In a match that determined which team finished top of Group ‘D’, Real Madrid beat Inter Milan 2-0 despite being without injured star striker Karim Benzema at the Santiago Bernabeu. 
Toni Kroos and Marco Asensio, with a brilliant curler that flew in off the far post, scored the goals for the 13-time European champions. 
Inter, who were already sure of a top-two finish, had Italy midfielder Nicolo Barella sent off for lashing out at Eder Militao. 
“Our objective is to go all the way, not just reach the last 16,” said Real coach Carlo Ancelotti. 
Moldovan debutants Sheriff Tiraspol had already secured third place before Boban Nikolov’s injury-time goal earned them a 1-1 draw at bottom side Shakhtar Donetsk, for whom Fernando had opened the scoring.

8,Seven-time champion Serena Williams won’t play Australian Open,"“While this is never an easy decision to make, I am not where I need to be physically to compete,” says the 40-year-old.","MELBOURNE: Not long after Serena Williams’ name was absent from the entry list for the Australian Open, she confirmed the obvious: the seven-time champion won’t play the 2022 edition of the season-opening major in January.
The 40-year-old Serena hasn’t played since retiring from her first-round match at Wimbledon with a right hamstring injury and her ranking has slipped to No. 41. She won the last of her 23 Grand Slam singles titles at the 2017 Australian Open, and was beaten in the semifinals this year by Naomi Osaka in straight sets.
The Australian Open’s website on Wednesday said, “The seven-time women’s singles champion would not compete in Melbourne following advice from her medical team.” 
“While this is never an easy decision to make, I am not where I need to be physically to compete,” Serena told the website. 
“Melbourne is one of my favourite cities to visit and I look forward to playing at the AO every year. I will miss seeing the fans, but am excited to return and compete at my highest level.”
Ash Barty tops the women’s entry list and will continue her quest to end a long drought for Australian women at the tournament. No Australian woman has won the singles title since Chris O’Neil in 1978.
On Monday, Bianca Andreescu, the 2019 U.S. Open champion said she will take a mental break from tennis and sit out the start of next season, including the Australian Open.

9,Elephant kills two Sri Lanka cricket stadium staff,The venue is near a wildlife sanctuary and in a largely rural area known for human-elephant conflict due to habitat loss.,"COLOMBO: Two ground staff at an international cricket stadium in Sri Lanka were killed in an elephant attack, officials said on Wednesday.
The two workers were heading home on Tuesday evening when they were attacked outside the Suriyawewa Mahinda Rajapaksa international stadium in Hambantota.
Their bodies were found around 500 metres (550 yards) apart, a Sri Lanka Cricket official said, adding that while there were no witnesses, a single animal was believed to have attacked both men.
The venue is near a wildlife sanctuary and in a largely rural area known for human-elephant conflict due to habitat loss.
The men had been carrying out preparatory work for the semi-finals and finals of the Lanka Premier League due to be held at the stadium later this month.
Most recently, it hosted a One-day International between Sri Lanka and the West Indies in February last year.
