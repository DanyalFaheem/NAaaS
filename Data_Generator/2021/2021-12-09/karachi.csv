JI Karachi chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman launched the campaign from Idara Noor-i-Haq by signing on a banner inscribed with demands of the JI.  
On the occasion while talking to the media, the JI leader said that the party was taking masses on board against the PPP policies in Sindh and the PTI’s strategies in the centre. “In connection with the Dec 13 March, camps will be set up across the city to create awareness of the bill among the masses. The banners will be placed at the camps for people to become a part of this campaign by signing it,” he said. 
Meanwhile, the MQM-P has sped up its campaign for its upcoming multiparty conference (MPC) on Dec 11, extending invitations to parties across the country. On Wednesday senior leaders of the party visited the Karachi headquarters of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) and Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid, met their leaders and invited them to the Dec 11 conference.  
The MQM-P delegation in their separate meetings with the leaders of the two parties agreed on a joint strategy of opposition parties against the recently passed bill for larger ‘interest’ of Sindh and its people.  
“Despite toeing different political ideologies and association with different platforms, every true democratic force believes that the PPP government has made an attempt to make this local government system in the province a subservient to the chief minister. We have agreed to reach every party for a joint struggle against this law,” said MQM leader Kanwar Naveed Jameel.  
The PSP also launched the campaign against the bill and in first phase placed banners and posters across the city denouncing the Sindh government’s move and demanding withdrawal of the law.  
A statement issued by the party said that hundreds of PSP workers were mobilised and a visible campaign had been launched in every city district.  
“This is a black law and a conspiracy of the PPP government and it must be stopped from taking measures that might alienate people of urban areas of the province from the state,” said the statement.

1,Call to end demolition of working-class homes,KARACHI: The organisers and allies of the People’s Climate March to be held on Sunday said on Wednesday that the...,"KARACHI: The organisers and allies of the People’s Climate March to be held on Sunday said on Wednesday that the purpose of their event was to organise a people-led response to the environmental crisis with victims of climate injustice at the forefront.
Speaking at a press conference at the Karachi Press Club, they cited the affectees of demolitions along Gujjar and Orangi Nullah, Malir Expressway and Karachi Circular Railway and those who have been forcibly displaced by the violent practices of Bahria Town, Defence Housing Authority and other developers among the victims of climate injustice in Karachi.
It was explained during the press conference that there is currently a collective urgency in the world as it is suffering from a catastrophic environmental crisis caused by the profit motivated, extractive practices of a few. 
The futility of COP26 has also made it evident that under the current capitalist system, the common people will not be able to save the environment. So in light of the repeated failure of world governments and international regulatory bodies to alleviate this crisis, it is obvious that there is a need for people-centred response in the form of a grassroots struggle, they added.
On the occasion, the organisers and allies of the march also shared a set of demands such as an end to the demolition of working-class homes and villages and the right to shelter of the displaced. 
Another demand was for a bill to be passed in reference to the affectees of the Gujjar and Orangi Nullahs, the KCR and Haji Lemo Goth with the same urgency as displayed to protect ‘buildings’. It was also demanded that the affectees be given alternative housing of 120 square yards in their districts. 
They also demanded a transparent compensation process, and resolution of issues of identity cards along with the constitution of a rehabilitation committee.

If one party (Pakistan Peoples Party) had not gone against Pakistan Democratic Movement’s decision to tender resignations, the movement would have already sent Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government packing on March 26. If all parties had resigned en masse it would not have been possible for the incumbent government to hold by-elections for 400 seats but unfortunately one party declined to resign, he said.
He was speaking to journalists and members of District Bar Association in Matiari and party workers in Shaheed Benazirabad and Naushahro Feroze districts on Wednesday. 
He claimed that PDM would score a decisive goal on March 23, when military and peoples’ parades would be held together in Islamabad.
He said that PTI did not announce its date of dharna after “seeking permission from someone” and paid tribute to lawyers for their contribution to democratic movement.
He said that security never depended on tanks and piles of ammunition, it always relied on human resources, strong economy and rule of law. Hybrid war could only be fought with vote and rule of constitution instead of a “hybrid system”, he said. 
He said that only a strong democratic and parliamentary system could eliminate poverty and unemployment from the country. Nobody could dare play with Constitution, he warned and said Rs16,000bn loans were utilised only to meet budget deficit. 
Iqbal said that PDM had taken the ball to the rival’s D and was about to hit it into the goal when the party took timeout and the movement failed. The PDM had again created the momentum to score a decisive goal on March 23 next year to oust this government, he said. 
He said that PML-N had four finance ministers in its fold and it had never to borrow finance ministers while both PPP and PTI had to import their finance ministers.
DADU: Iqbal said at the party workers’ gatherings in Kazi Ahmed town, Shaheed Benazirabad, and Naushahro Feroze districts that next prime minister would be from PML-N and the party would rule the country once again. 
He said that poverty had increased and people were forced to commit suicide due to ill advised economic policies of PTI rulers. Prices of oil, gas and power had skyrocketed, which had caused poverty and created uncertainty among people, he said. 
He said that PML-N government had in past built wide network of motorways to facilitate travel between major cities. Economy was stable and foreign policy was on the right track, he said. 
He said that almost all PML-N leaders were facing fake cases but still all party activists and leaders were united under the leadership of PML-N President Mian Mohammad Shahbaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz on one platform.
The party activists had set up camps at several places along National Highway in Shaheed Benazirabad and Naushahro Feroze districts to welcome their leader.

6,Khuhro says Sindh within its rights to amend LG law,HYDERABAD: Pakis­tan Peoples Party Sindh president Nisar Ahmed Khuhro has defended newly-introduced amendments to...,"HYDERABAD: Pakis­tan Peoples Party Sindh president Nisar Ahmed Khuhro has defended newly-introduced amendments to local government law by Sindh Assembly and said the Sindh Assembly is within its rights to enact a law to decentralise the LG system.
Khuhro said at a press briefing at a party leader’s residence here on Wednesday before chairing a meeting of the party office bearers and parliamentarians on PPP’s planned protest against Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf on Dec 10 in Hyderabad that local government was a provincial subject and the Sindh Assembly was within its rights to enact a law whereby it had decentralised the LG system. 
He said that every divisional headquarters would now have a corporation under which towns had been created. The number of towns in Karachi had been increased from 18 to 26 so that power was devolved to grassroots level and rural areas had been upgraded to urban spots, he said. 
“What is the harm in declaring the rural areas as urban when there is already growing pressure on existing urban areas in the province? These areas might receive more facilities after becoming urban,” he said.
He dismissed criticism over election of mayor through secret ballot under the amended law, saying the same procedure was applied for the election of prime minister, chief minister and speaker. “We can’t make a person specific law in which it is written that only MQM’s mayors will be elected in Karachi and Hyderabad,” he said sarcastically.
He said that under Musharraf’s LG system Karachi was made one district with 15 million population while Hyderabad with 5m population was divided into four districts. Sindh governor had returned the amended LG bill but the assembly would resend it and it would automatically become a law if he sent it back again, he said.
He said the office of vice chairman had been improved to ensure participatory democracy. Funds would be transferred to union committees and councils as per procedure, he said.
MIRPURKHAS: Khu­hro said at a press conference on Wednesday that PPP was not rejoining PDM and said if the alliance had started long march about six months back people would have got rid of PTI government by now.
He said the PDM had thrown another lifeline to the present government by announcing that the march would be held in March next year. 
He said that Sindh’s rights had been usurped by federal government which had rejected the province’s objections over census.

8,Animal rights activist fears for life,"""If anyone tries to draw attention towards the plight of animals, she/he has to face consequences,"" says filmmaker Mahera Omar.","KARACHI: An animal rights activist, who had recently highlighted the plight of four elephants kept at Karachi Zoological Gardens and Safari Park, feared for her life for raising the issue and approached the police for protection.
Film-maker Mahera Omar, who is co-founder of the Pakistan Animal Welfare Society (PAWS), tweeted from Paws handle on Dec 7: “So, some goons showed up at my neighbourhood the other day asking for ‘the madam who has been going to the zoo’. This was bound to happen. Months after we filed a petition in Sindh High Court for an independent medical assessment of the Karachi elephants, my life is in danger.”
“The goons presumably saw me at the zoo with the @fourpawsint veterinary team and now I’m their target. I fear for my family, and for my own life. I request President @ArifAlvi, my local elected member of the National Asse­m­bly, and @BBhuttoZardari to look into the matter,” read another tweet. 
Talking to Dawn on Wednesday, Ms Omar said she approached the SHO of the Gizri police station and neighbourhood police in Defence Housing Authority and they had increased ‘security’ in her area. 
She said the SHO told her to submit a written application so that an FIR could be lodged and proper legal proceedings may be initiated.
Ms Mahera said some months ago Paws had filed a petition in the SHC drawing the attention towards the plight of elephants at Zoo and Safari Park. It was of the considered view that a proper check-up of the elephants should be carried out by the veterinary doctors who had experience of treating elephants and finally a team of vets arrived and conducted the elephants’ check-up.
Ms Omar recalled an incident in which some unknown persons in a car came to her neighbourhood on Dec 5 and asked the watchman about her whereabouts. She said she felt ‘insecure’ and fear for her life after this incident.
“I am living in fear...it was very difficult to help animals. And if anyone tries to draw attention towards the plight of animals, she/he has to face consequences,” she said.

9,"Bilawal admits LG bill passed in ‘haste’, says PPP ready for talks",Warns any move under 'false pretext’ of complaints against bill to delay local govt elections will not be tolerated.,"KARACHI: Conceding that the Sindh Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2021 was passed in ‘haste’ by his government, the Pakistan Peoples Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Wednesday blamed the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for this hurry, as it had set a deadline for the legislation.
However, he invited all parties of the province for talks, saying that the Sindh government was still open to incorporate justified contributions of all political stakeholders before the bill becomes a law. 
However, he warned that any move under the ‘false pretext’ of complaints and reservations against the LG bill to delay the local government elections would not be tolerated.
Speaking at a press conference at Bilawal House, he added that the PPP government was determined to hold polls for municipal administrations in every district of Sindh that would further strengthen the democratic roots and devolve powers to the grassroots level. 
“Because of the restrictions of the ECP, we needed to pass it [Sindh Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2021] in haste,” he said. 

Says Sindh has no space for politics of hatred

“That has created a space for misunderstanding. Otherwise, we would have definitely held conversation and arrange debate with civil society, political stakeholders and the opposition. The deadline of Nov 30 [by ECP] in fact created the confusion and constrained several things,” he said.
Accompanied by Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, Administrator Murtaza Wahab, LG Minister Syed Nasir Hussain Shah, Information Minister Saeed Ghani and party’s information secretary Shazia Mari, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said that the Sindh government was still ready to accept any suggestion from the opposition if found justified and in line with democratic norms. 
Politics of ‘ethnic divide’
When he was referred to serious allegations from his opponents that the new bill was creating urban-rural and ethnic divide, the PPP chairman called it “politics of Altaf Hussain [founder of Muttahida Qaumi Movement]” and warned there was no space left for such ‘hatred’. 
“As far as dialogue is concerned, we are in contact with all political parties for their suggestions and proposals on the bill and still we would like them to come up with the same and their justified contributions would be accepted,” said Mr Bhutto-Zardari. 
“But no one should reject or criticise this bill saying that it carries ethnic colour. There’s nothing like that. This is a typical Altaf Hussain mindset. This is his politics. But this should be clear to everyone that this city and this province have no more space for this politics of hatred. It no more allows anyone to sell such idea among the peace-loving people of this province.” 
The offer to opposition parties from the PPP chairman came only a day after Sindh Governor Imran Ismail refused to give his assent to the LG bill and returned it to the Sindh Assembly for reconsideration raising several objections. 
The effectiveness of the flexibility showed by the ruling party chief, however, remains under question as the joint opposition in the Sindh Assembly has already ruled out any possibility of talks with the provincial government before the withdrawal of the controversial bill, warning the PPP would face a strong reaction from all political stakeholders who are planning a protest movement against the ‘dictatorial law’. 
Shrugs off PTI’s criticism
At the press conference when asked about the fast declining culture of tolerance and dialogue among political rivals and recent episodes in the Sindh Assembly, he said that the PPP had always welcomed criticism, but criticised the role of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf as the opposition party saying that it had always played a ‘dual game’ which could not be justified. 
“Frankly speaking, I see the criticism of other political parties [against the recently passed bill] justified to some extent,” he said. “But the PTI criticism on the process cannot be justified by any means. I told you that it is due to time constraints which led to passing of this bill in haste but how can the PTI protest over this? Draft of every single law passed by the PTI government in the centre is never shared with the National Assembly. They bulldoze every rule in the parliament and here they present themselves as true democrats,” he said.

An interim investigation report was submitted by the investigating officer of the case, Muhammad Siraj Lashari, before a judicial magistrate (Malir).
Nazim Sajawal Jokhio’s tortured body was found at a Malir farmhouse, said to be owned by MPA Awais, last month.
Initially, his brother Afzal Jokhio had nominated MPA Awais and MNA Jam Abdul Karim for being involved in the murder of the 27-year-old victim, who had earned the ire of the influential when tried to prevent their guests from hunting houbara bustard in Thatta district.
During Wednesday’s proceedings, the IO submitted in the report that the sample of blood found on a quilt and bed in the room of the private guard’s of the lawmaker on the premises of his farmhouse had matched with those of the victim during a chemical analysis.
He further stated that no traces of poisoning were found during the post-mortem examination of the victim, adding that the sticks used to beat him had also been recovered.
However, the IO said forensic reports were still awaited and requested for time to enable him to collect and submit the final investigation report in court.
Counsel for complainant Afzal Jokhio informed the judge that two suspects — MNA Jam Abdul Karim and Niaz Salar, who were already on bail — had purportedly fled abroad, adding that according to rumours they had escaped to Saudi Arabia or Dubai.

A two-judge bench headed by Justice Zafar Ahmed Rajput remarked that it was not the domain of the cantonment board or its officials to set up or run cattle markets.
When the bench asked the lawyer for the cantonment board whether they were mandated to run businesses, he replied that the board was just providing services.
The court deplored that the petition had been pending for quite some time but the cantonment board filed a reply after an inordinate delay. The court adjourned the hearing till Jan 20 as the lawyer for petitioner sought time to go through the comments filed by the cantonment board.

SBCA chief summoned to explain frequent transfers of officials

A private housing society — the Pakistan Navy (CNGE) Cooperative Housing Society — through its lawyer Nasir Tarar filed a petition in 2016 against the cantonment board for setting up a cattle market on its land before Eidul Azha. 
SBCA chief summoned 
The same bench on Wednesday summoned the director general of the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) observing that frequent transfers of officials were frustrating its various orders against illegal constructions in the city.
It observed that frequent transfers of public servants were affecting their morale and weaken administration, which could not be termed “good governance”.
At the outset of the hearing, SBCA official Syed Mohammad Zia appeared before the bench and filed a report in compliance with an earlier order.
He informed the bench that the competent authority had reshuffled/transferred the directors of different districts as he was transferred from South to East and then posted as deputy director-Malir.
He submitted that he had requested the current deputy director-South to make compliance of an earlier order about illegal constructions, but he neither appeared nor filed a compliance report.
The bench observed in its order that it appeared that in many identical petitions on the subject of illegal constructions various orders had been passed by this court requiring compliance of the directions, which are being frustrated by way of making frequent transfers/postings of the officers/officials of SBCA.
It further observed that in the present case the officer in question had been transferred twice in three weeks, which in fact had not only hindered and impeded the compliance of the court orders but also amounted to defiance of such orders.
The bench directed the SBCA chief to appear in person along with a comprehensive report on Dec 4 and also asked its office to communicate this order to the secretary of the local government department for information and compliance.
The bench has been passing various orders almost on a daily basis against removal of illegal constructions, prosecution against builders/owners of such buildings and action against SBCA officials for allowing such constructions on identical petitions filed against illegal constructions across the city.

13,No end to patients’ suffering as doctors-govt talks fail,Protest sit-in of nurses continues...,"KARACHI: The Young Doctors Association (YDA), Sindh, continued their boycott of out-patient departments (OPDs) at public sector hospitals on a third consecutive day on Wednesday across the province as talks between their representatives and health department officials failed.
The association announced that they would continue their boycott till their demands were met.
“Today’s meeting of YDA Sindh was scheduled with health officials. Each and every point was discussed in detail but (the parties) couldn’t reach any conclusion. That’s why a complete boycott of OPDs will continue till acceptance of our demands,” said Dr Faizan Hussain Memon in a message on a social media group.
Sources said the talks between the association representatives and the health department officials couldn’t reach a common point for consensus. The government officials sought more time to look into the demands of YDA, which wanted an immediate notification on a few issues.

Protest sit-in of nurses continues

Earlier in the day, patients at OPDs had to return home without any medical consultation amid doctors’ protests held in major tertiary care hospitals of the province including the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, National Institute of Child Health, Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi and Civil Hospital Hyderabad.
However, the young doctors’ body claimed that there was no disruption in service at emergency units, intensive care units, operation theatres and general, private wards.
The association is demanding paid deputation and central induction policies, increase in risk allowance and stipends of post-graduate trainees and house officers and regularisation of all doctors hired on contract basis.
It also urged the government to make Covid-19 risk allowance a permanent feature of doctors’ salaries and resolve the matter of their transfers at JPMC and NICH.
The government should also announce 500 seats of dental surgeons and make a separate cadre for the hiring of medical legal officers, YDA officials said.
At their demonstration at CHK, doctors also demanded that CT and MRI scan machines be made functional.
At the JPMC, several protesters held banners inscribed with slogans demanding immediate hiring of doctors to address their shortage at the hospital.
Meanwhile, nurses’ representatives continued with their sit-in outside the Karachi Press Club.
“So far, the government has only notified recruitment and promotion rules. We want some other issues to be resolved first before ending our protest,” said Aijaz Kaleri representing the Young Nurses’ Association, Sindh, adding that the government officials had sought time till Friday (tomorrow).
The nurses have suspended their services in the general wards of public sector hospitals across Sindh. A few days back, scores of nurses were thrashed, baton-charged and briefly detained by the police when they tried to march on the Chief Minister House.
Their demands include regularisation of nurses appointed at various healthcare facilities over the past two years for services related to Covid-19 and implementation of the Pakistan Nursing Council decision, according to which, nurses should head educational and training institutions for lady health workers and midwives.
“The government should also separate nurses’ education and deputation policies from that of doctors and raise stipend of trainee nurses who are getting a meagre monthly stipend of Rs15,880 unlike other provinces where this amount has risen to Rs33,000,” said Mr Kaleri.

14,NED bus driver acquitted in 2014 case of running over woman,Model Court orders govt to pay diyat to deceased’s heirs observing blood of Muslim shall not go in vain...,"KARACHI: A model court on Wednesday acquitted the driver of an NED University point bus for want of evidence in a case pertaining to crushing a woman to death in 2014.
However, the court ordered the Sindh government to pay monetary compensation to the legal heirs of the victim.
Driver Hanif Akhtar was charged with rashly driving a point bus of the NED University and running over Areeba and wounding motorcyclist Irfan, Komal and Nasira in Sector 11-B, North Karachi on Sept 9, 2014.
On Wednesday, Judge Liaqat Ali Khoso of the Model Criminal Trial Court (central) pronounced his verdict reserved after recording evidence and final arguments from both sides.

Model Court orders govt to pay diyat to deceased’s heirs observing blood of Muslim shall not go in vain

The judge noted that the investigating officer failed to collect the evidence to establish that accused Akhtar was driving the varsity’s bus on the fateful day, adding that no testimony of the students commuting in the bus were recorded.
The court also observed that it transpired that the motorcyclist, Irfan, was riding with three pillion-passengers and their school bags, which showed negligence and irresponsible manner on his part. “The fault of deceased/victim also could not be ruled out,” the court stated.
The judge extended the benefit of the doubt to the accused and acquitted him.
In an interesting move, the judge ruled: “As per Shariah, the blood never goes vain and futile in Islam. Another proposition is that blood of Muslim shall not go in vain and futile in Islam.”
“The government is responsible for securing the blood of a deceased to be safeguarded. Hence, the provincial government is directed to initiate the case of the deceased Areeba Suhrab regarding payment of Diyat amount to her legal heirs, as per law and rules,” the judge ordered.
The court directed its office to send a copy of the judgement to the secretary of the Sindh government for compliance and submitting a report on implementation of these directives in letter and spirit.
A case was registered under Sections 320 (punishment for qatl-i-khata by rash or negligent driving), 337-G (punishment for hurt by rash or negligent driving), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) and 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way) of the Pakistan Penal Code at the Sir Syed police station.
