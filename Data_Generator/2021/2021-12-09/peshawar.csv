Led by Malik Sheerin, Toti Gul, Abdul Jameed, Shah Gul and Charri Gul, the residents addressed a press conference in Mingora. They said that the joint land was owned by three tribes of Bahrain tehsil including Habibkhel, Inamkhel and Sulemankhel. They said that it was illegally transferred by some officials of the revenue department in 1988.
“Former revenue clerk Nadir Shah, a resident of Bahrain village, deceived the simple people of our areas and got their thumb impressions on a document. Since they were illiterate, they did not know on what documents they put their thumb impressions,” the elders said and added that later they learnt that the land owned by the three tribes was illegally transferred to the clerk.
They said that the land under Khasra numbers 2178, 2179 and 2188, which belonged to the tribes of Badai and Serai areas, was transferred and illegally to Nadir Shah, his relatives and other officials of the revenue department.
They said when they learnt about the fraud, they approached higher authorities and also moved court against the clerk. “When we filed a case in the court against the clerk, he started threatening us,” they said, asking the government to provide protection to them against him and his accomplices.
The elders said that the court was also situated in Bahrain town and when they visited the court for hearing Nadar Shah and his accomplices created a hurdle to them and also threatened them. “We need not only protection from them but also demand of the government to vacate our land from his family,” they added.
They said that they would never tolerate anyone, who tried to illegally capture their collective land and would resist the move. They appealed to chief minister and Malakand commissioner and DIG to initiate a high level inquiry into the issue and retrieve their land from the occupants after conducting the probe.

4,Growers reject Rs260 per kg tobacco price for next crop,"SWABI: Rejecting the Rs260 per kilogramme price offered by the companies for the next crop, tobacco growers on...","SWABI: Rejecting the Rs260 per kilogramme price offered by the companies for the next crop, tobacco growers on Wednesday vowed to continue their agitation against the purchasing firms and the Pakistan Tobacco Board (PTB) for their apathy towards their plight.
Leaders of Ittehad Kashtkaran (IK), which is leading the growers’ campaign, said the recommendation of the National Assembly committee on agriculture products to the commerce ministry to fix the minimum indicative price of tobacco at Rs260 per kilogramme was not acceptable to them.
However, they welcomed the parliamentary panel’s direction to the PTB to ensure lifting of all the cured crop from the farmers. They regretted that the PTB had failed to take practical steps for implementation of the tobacco purchasing policy.
Talking to Dawn, growers’ leader Mohammad Ali Dagaiwal said they were pursing the farmers not to cultivate tobacco during the current season as a protest against the PTB and the purchasing firms.
Liaqat Yousafzai, president of Tobacco Growers Association Pakistan, demanded Rs300 per kilogramme price for the next crop as expenditures on growing the crop had increased manifold.
Meanwhile, it has been learnt that neither the PTB nor the companies have issued the tobacco demand for the year 2022, which is violation of tobacco marketing law MLO 487. The growers said it was the PTB’s duty to ask the companies to issue tobacco purchasing demand in time.

5,PHC again seeks NAB report on govt projects,Bureau says status of pending probes being examined in light of recent ordinance.,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Wednesday directed the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) again to produce a report on its inquiries into the alleged irregularities in the Bank of Khyber recruitment, Billion Tree Tsunami afforestation programme and Malam Jabba ski resort land lease.
A bench consisting of Justice Roohul Amin Khan and Justice Ijaz Anwar fixed Jan 12 for the next hearing into a pro bono petition filed by Dr Adil Zareef, Maimoona Noor and four civil society members seeking the court’s orders for action against the NAB officials over failure to act over the alleged irregularities in leading projects of the provincial government.
The bench ordered the production of the inquiry report by that date.
The petitioners claimed that the NAB was carrying out selective accountability and had put all cases against the ruling PTI’s members on the back-burner.

Bureau says status of pending probes being examined in light of recent ordinance

They requested the court to declare that the NAB had failed to perform duties in relation to cases of the erstwhile KP Ehtesab Commission, corruption in Billion Tree Tsunami project, illegal appointments in Bank of Khyber (BOK) and Malam Jabba Ski resort lease cases and that this failure was arbitrary and illegal.
They have also sought the court’s orders for action against the NAB officers, who have failed to perform duties about those cases, under the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO), 1999.
When the bench took up for hearing, the petitioners’ counsel, Ali Gohar Durrani, pointed out that during previous hearing, the court had ordered the NAB in Oct to submit reports about the inquiries conducted into those three government projects.
He, however, said the bureau had so far not produced those reports.
NAB prosecutor Riaz Ahmad told the bench that the country’s president recently promulgated an ordinance through which several changes were made in the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999.
He said the bureau had been examining the status of the pending inquiries and investigations in light of the recently promulgated ordinance.
During hearing, Justice Roohul Amin Khan observed that if the NAB was interested, it knew how to arrest a man even after changes were made to the law. Mr Durrani pointed out that during pendency of the petition, the NAB had also closed its investigation in the Malam Jabba land lease case.
The bench asked the prosecutor why the NAB hadn’t produced the inquiry reports despite orders.
The prosecutor sought time for submitting the inquiry report.
Mr Durrani contended that those NAB officers should be made accountable who had been guilty of giving undue favours by blocking the accountability of the people involved in those alleged irregularities.
He said the NAB hadn’t showed any progress on the Billion Tree Tsunami and BOK alleged illegal appointment cases.
The respondents in the petition are the federation of Pakistan through law secretary, interior secretary, NAB through its chairman, NAB Executive Board through its chairman, and NAB KP through its director general.
During previous hearing the Nab representatives had told the court that investigation had been completed about a portion of the Billion Tree Tsunami project in Dera Ismail Khan and a reference was expected to be filed in near future.
They had said investigation was also done about BOK recruitment, while its findings were sent to the NAB headquarters for decision on whether or not to file a reference with the relevant accountability court.

6,Ex-bureaucrat’s book sets guidelines for public servants,PESHAWAR: Speakers at a ceremony here on Wednesday termed a newly published book as basic guidelines for the ...,"PESHAWAR: Speakers at a ceremony here on Wednesday termed a newly published book as basic guidelines for the upcoming public servants and administrators.
They said that the author chronicled fascinating account of his over 40-year service in different parts of the country including tribal districts, Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
The event was arranged at Area Study Centre, University of Peshawar, to launch the book ‘Frontier Stations’ authored by former bureaucrat Shakil Durrani.
Former bureaucrats, senior faculty members and students of the university attended the event.
The speakers said that author had revived traditions of writing memoirs in a lucent manner to attract readers and present visible picture of his experiences and observations on a number of issues.
They pointed out that the book was not a dry recall but a fluent commentary remixed with anecdotes, satire and humour to spur instant thought on deteriorating moral standards and societal bankruptcy. “Besides a fascinating account, the book offers an insight into how system of public service survives in the wake of castigated so-called power welders,” they added.
Prof Shabir Ahmad Khan, the director of Area Study Centre, said that book contained lessons for all segments of the society and the intuitions working in the public domain as the author had based his observations on empirical data.
He said that it was just a dirge on the rotten system but also offered some practical steps to improve and reform the mindset governing the entire societal engine amidst political manoeuvring.
Prof Azamat Hayat Khan, former vice-chancellor of UoP, said that the book should be read as a text narrating tale of bad governance in the light of experiences of a civil servant, who preserved a glimpse of reasons behind crumbling edifice of public life.
Sahibzada Riaz Noor, former bureaucrat, remarked that such accounts of civil servants provided guidelines for upcoming officers. He said that the book was written in a frank narrative suggesting a dire need for gradual transformation of society through fair justice and accountability. “All the ills rampant in our society should be seen in a historical perspective,” he added.
Rustam Shah Mohmand, another former bureaucrat, commented that the book highlighted all the gray areas that forced every thinking mind to be worried about including agriculture, health, education and several other fields.
The author, Shakil Durrani, said that the book was both commentary on system of administration in the country and also a revisit of his memories drenched in scathing satirical undertones, which would benefit readers and research scholars alike at many levels.

The officials of revenue department, National Highway Authority and police were present on the occasion.

8,Shaukat Tarin’s candidature for Senate  by-election challenged,Appellant insists PM’s aide not Khyber Pakhtunkhwa resident and his vote was illegally shifted to province.,"PESHAWAR: A candidate on Wednesday moved the appellate tribunal challenging the candidature of adviser to the prime minister on finance Shaukat Tarin for the Senate by-elections requesting to declare his nomination papers as invalid as he was not a resident of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and his vote was illegally transferred here.
An appeal was filed by Awami National Party nominee Dr Shaukat Jamal Amirzadah against the acceptance of Tarin’s nomination papers by the returning officer on Dec 6.
Filed through Barrister Syed Mudasser Ameer and Barrister M Yasin Raza, it requested the tribunal to set aside the returning officer’s order declaring it illegal.
According to the election schedule, the tribunal has to decide the appeal by Dec 10.

Appellant insists PM’s aide not KP resident, his vote illegally shifted to province

The Senate seat has fallen vacant following the resignation of PTI Senator Ayub Afridi.
Provincial Election Commissioner Sharifullah is the returning officer for the by-election for which polling will take place on Dec 20 here in the provincial assembly’s building here.
The Election Commission of Pakistan will publish the revised list of the candidates on Dec 11. The candidates can withdraw nominations by Dec 13.
The appellant has raised several legal points in his appeal insisting Mr Tarin is neither a registered voter of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa nor is he a resident of Mardan district, where he has transferred his vote to.
He added that Mr Tarin was a permanent resident of Karachi and that his vote was illegally transferred to Mardan as there was a bar on the transfer of vote after the announcement of schedule for the first phase of the local body polls in 17 districts of the province, including Mardan.
The appellant said under Article 62 (1)(C) of the Constitution, a candidate contesting for a seat from a particular province should be registered as a voter in that province.
He contended that Section 110(5) of the Elections Act, 2017, explicitly declared that every nomination paper should be accompanied by a certified copy of the relevant extract from the electoral rolls in which the name of the person nominated was enrolled.
The appellant said Mr Tarin hadn’t attached that certified copy along with his nomination papers.
He said it was evident from the copy of the computerised national identity card of Mr Tarin attached with the nomination papers that the CNIC wasissued on Oct 28, 2021, wherein his temporary address was changed to Mardan.
The appellant said it was in common knowledge that the PTI nominee was a permanent resident of Karachi and lived in a five-star hotel during his stay in Islamabad.
He contended that under Section 39 of the Elections Act, 2017, no revision, correction or transfer of vote in an electoral roll of an area could be made during the period beginning 30 days before the day on which the term of an assembly or a local government was due to expire until the announcement of the results of the general elections to the assembly or the local government.
The appellant said coincidentally, the Senate by-elections and the local government elections had overlapped, so due to the announcement of local government elections through a notification on Nov 4, no changes could be made to the electoral rolls under the law.
He said the vote of Mr Tarin was illegally transferred to the province as it happened after the announcement of the local body election schedule on Nov 16.

The decision was taken at a meeting held in Jamrud. FQJ chairman Malik Bismillah Khan, Malik Abdur Razzaq Zakhakhel, Malik Afrasiyab, Malik Tamash Shalmani, Malik Najeeb Torkhel, Malik Saleen Katiyakhel and others participated in the jirga, and unanimously announced their boycott of the local government elections scheduled to be held on Dec 19.
Addressing the jirga, Malik Bismillah Khan said holding of local body polls was aimed at further strengthening the merger of erstwhile Fata with KP, adding they rejected these elections just as they had rejected the merger.
He maintained that neither were the tribal people aware about the local government system nor was there any such structure existed in the merged districts, thus the polls would bring no benefits to the already deprived residents of the region.
He regretted that the local government elections were being organised in a hasty manner, saying the real stakeholders were into taken confidence when the ex-Fata’s merger was decided.
The other speakers said the performance of public representatives elected to provincial assembly was zero as they had failed to secure the pledged development funds for their respective districts.
The elders appealed to the people of tribal districts to also boycott the polls and strive for the repeal of the 25th Constitutional Amendment, under which the merger of their region was executed.

Sources in the Regional Election Commission’s office told Dawn that an advisory was issued to the Prime Minister’s House at 9:40am on Wednesday, while the prime minister launched the Naya Pakistan Card about health, educational and agricultural incentives at the Governor’s House in the afternoon ignoring the advisory.
The advisory read, “It has come to notice of the undersigned through Daily Dawn, December 8, 2021 that you are expected to visit Peshawar today to launch Pakistan Card Initiative.”
It drew the prime minister’s attention towards its earlier instructions regarding the visit to the area of any local council and announce of any development scheme after issuance of election schedule.

CM aide claims PM’s Peshawar visit didn’t violate LG poll code of conduct

In the first phase, the Election Commission of Pakistan is to conduct local body elections in 17 districts of the province on Dec 19, while the polls will be held in the remaining districts on Jan 16.
“After the issuance of election schedule, the president, prime minister, governor, speaker, deputy speaker of any assembly, chairman and deputy chairman of senate, federal and provincial ministers, advisers to the prime minister or chief minister or any other holder of public office shall not visit the area of any local council to announce any development scheme or to canvass or campaign for any candidate or any political party,” read the advisory.
It added that in case someone was a resident of the district, where election was to be held, he or she might visit the district but he or she should not take part in any kind of political activity.
“In view of above you (Prime Minister) are advised not to violate any provision of the code of conduct and instructions issued by the election commission otherwise legal proceedings under Section-233 and 234 of the Election Act, 2017 shall be initiated against you,” it said.
An official in the regional Election Commission of Pakistan told Dawn that a notice could be issued to the prime minister as he had violated the code of conduct.
“The issuance of notice to the prime minister is not the domain of the ECP regional office and instead, the matter will be handled by the central ECP office in Islamabad,” he said.
The official said the advisory issued to the prime minister had been shared with the Election Commission of Pakistan.
In response of the Election Commission’s advisory to the prime minister, special assistant to the chief minister on information and public relations Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif said Prime Minister Imran Khan’s visit to Peshawar was an official one and therefore, it wasn’t a violation of the Election Commission of Pakistan code of conduct.
“The visit is part of day to day affairs of the state and there is no ban on such activities,” he said in a statement issued here ahead of the Naya Pakistan Card event at the Governor’s House.
Mr Saif said the prime minister would attend only one official function and that, too, at the Governor’s House, and won’t take part in any electoral or public gatherings.
He said the local body polls were taking place in a few districts of the province, while the prime minister’s reform initiative was for the poor people of the entire country.
