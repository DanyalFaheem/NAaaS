0,Faisalabad assault case: CCTV footage to be made part of investigation,Police have already arrested five nominated suspects who allegedly stripped and filmed four women after accusing them of theft.,"LAHORE: Police said on Wednesday a CCTV footage would be made part of the investigation into stripping and filming of four women at a market in Faisalabad.
Five of the 10 suspects allegedly involved in assault on the trash picking women after accusing them of theft had already been arrested. The CCTV footage of a shop viral on social media websites showed that the women entered the shop and picked up something. However, a man standing in the shop tried to stop one of the women and after failing to stop, he came out of the shop.
The man later tried to lock the shop but the women resisted and came out of the shop where the man grabbed two of the four women and beat them besides calling other people as seen in the CCTV footage.
It showed that the women were unbuttoning their clothes and two others tried to run away but were later captured by the mob. The video also showed that the women were stripping themselves before the crowd and one of them was weeping in the shop while another was dragged into the shop by the men.
Faisalabad City Police Officer Dr Abid Khan told Dawn that the new footage of the incident was included in the investigation. He said the act of undressing by women would also be included in the investigation.
On Monday, a woman lodged a complaint with the Millat Town police station stating that she was collecting solid waste with her three women companions around 10:30am at the Bawa Chak Market, Yousaf Chowk, when she felt thirsty and went inside a shop — Usman Electric Store — owned by Saddam and asked for a bottle of water.
She said the owner alleged that they entered his shop to steal money and electronic appliances. They called other shopkeepers and helpers and beat them. “The suspects also stripped them and dragged them in the market,” she said.
Later, police arrested five nominated suspects who were also presented in court which handed over the suspect to police on physical remand.

2,Question raised about site for DHQ City Hospital’s trauma centre,OKARA: Questions have been raised about the site selected for the trauma centre of the District Headquarters (DHQ)...,"OKARA: Questions have been raised about the site selected for the trauma centre of the District Headquarters (DHQ) City Hospital as the centre’s entry is likely to be completely unapproachable.
There is a feasible site available at the corner of 60-40 feet wide road but it has been ignored by the hospital administration and the ruling party members currently behind selection of the site.
The site selected for the trauma centre for which the Punjab government released funds is just 15 feet from the main entrance to the medical ward & children ward of hospital and it is just adjacent to the newly-constructed mortuary block.
The trauma centre would have no direct approach except from the hospital’s eastern side boundary wall from a 15-foot road, leading to the Stadium along the western boundary wall of the Government Associate Degree College.
After construction of the centre, there would also be no easy access for the cardiology and orthopedic wards of the hospital.
Various representatives from different segments of the society, including Anjuman-i-Tajiran and social organisations, requested the hospital administration to change their plan but to no avail.
The government had approved Rs100m for establishing the trauma centre in its annual development programme in the last financial year.
A few weeks back, the Primary & Secondary Healthcare secretary visited the hospital as well as the trauma centre site. The civil society and local government representatives, led by municipal councillor Abdul Hameed Juj, requested the secretary to change the site and pointed out available options in the hospital. The secretary directed the health authorities to look into the matter but the situation remained the same.
This correspondent called DHQ City hospital Medical Superintendent Dr Mahar Akhtar Hussain Baloch for his comments but he was reluctant to talk on the ‘issue’.
It is going to be the only trauma centre on the national highway between Lahore and Multan as the former was 130km from Okara and the latter 217km.
The civil society has demanded Punjab Health Minister Dr Yasmin Rashid, secretary health,
Okara-based ministers Syed Samsam Ali Bokhari, Ijaz Alam Augustine, the PTI local leaders and Deputy Commissioner Muhammad Ali Ijaz others to intervene and change the site of the trauma centre for proper functioning of the centre as well as other wards of the hospital.

4,‘Unhealthy’ AQI puts question mark on stack emission monitoring of industries,"SAHIWAL: As tehsil Sahiwal’s air quality index (AQI) is unhealthy, the local Environmental Protection Department...","SAHIWAL: As tehsil Sahiwal’s air quality index (AQI) is unhealthy, the local Environmental Protection Department (EPD) has decided to go for a departmental stack emission monitoring of seven industrial units in Sahiwal.
It is said the seven units get stack emission monitoring conducted by a third party having a license of certified labs approved under Pakistan Environmental Quality Standards and these labs reports are submitted to the EPD office on a monthly or quarterly basis.
Stack emission monitoring is essentially the monitoring of air from an emission point. This type of monitoring is often carried out on printer exhausts, thermal oxidisers and boiler stacks amongst others. Stacks from industrial processes carry pollutants such as solvents, gases, dusts and particles.
Despite clear lab reports, the AQI of Sahiwal is increased from 122 US to 165 US, which is unhealthy.
EDP Assistant Director Younas Zahid said they had requested the environment department to monitor stack emission through the departmental laboratory.
Dawn learnt the seven industries whose stacks emission reports are sought include Huaneng Shandon Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Private Limited, Saif Power Plant, Adam Milk Food, Eden Milk Food, Suraj Fertilizer Pvt Limited, and Phillips Morris Tobacco Unit.
The EPD website has 14 certified labs for stack emission monitoring of private industries across Punjab.
Farooq Alam, deputy director of the Environmental Laboratory Section, told Dawn that though the seven industries are bound to get stack emission monitoring done through third parties, the department has the authority to recheck and overrule any submitted report. He confirmed the department was planning to do stack emission through its own laboratory.
He said the Sahiwal Coal-fired Power Plant’s monitoring would be held after special “permission and security clearance” from the quarters concerned.
Last month, the Sahiwal district administration sealed two biomass-fired boilers of a private company for spreading air pollution and smog. Dawn learnt from sources though the district administration on Nov 6 de-sealed both boilers, EPD has to do an internal stack emission of them.

5,Notification of increase in PAS officers in provinces suspended,Petitioner argues federal govt can only post its civil servants in relation to matters on the federal legislative list.,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Wednesday suspended the operation of a federal government notification that increased Centre’s share in the provincial bureaucracy.
Justice Sajid Mahmood Sethi stayed the notification hearing a petition challenging the existence of the Pakistan Administrative Service (PAS) and posting of its members in the provinces.
Several officers of the Punjab Provincial Management Service (PMS) filed the petition through Advocate Bilal Hasan Minto.
The PMS counsel argued that the 1954 CSP rules, which were used by the federal government to post its officers against provincial posts, were unconstitutional. The federal government was not entitled to post its civil servants, including those belonging to the PAS, on provincial posts, he added.
He stated the federation, in fact, encroached upon the authority of the Punjab government by reserving posts in the province for the PAS officers through the impugned rules.
He argued that the federal government could only post its civil servants in relation to matters on the federal legislative list, and all other postings, including those of the chief secretary, were purely provincial posts which could not be occupied by the federal employees.
Mr Minto contended that the government issued the impugned notification on March 12, 2021, through which the posts of the federal officers in the provinces were further increased from 115 to 446.
The counsel asked the court to end the unconstitutional hegemony and control of the provincial bureaucracy by the federation which routinely posted PAS members on important posts in the provinces.
The court was also asked to order the respondents to withdraw the PAS officers appointed against the provincial posts in Punjab forthwith and only PMS officers be appointed on such posts.
Justice Sethi suspended the impugned notification and sought detailed replies from the federal and provincial governments on the date of hearing to be fixed by the office.
LG tenure: The Lahore High Court has issued a notice to the advocate general of Punjab on a petition of chairman of a city’s union council for the provision of time/period excluded due to the enactment of the Punjab Local Government Act, 2019 in tenure to complete five years.
Aleem Majeed Awan filed the petition through Barrister Asad Rahim Khan saying he was a member of local governments formed under the Punjab Local Government Act, 2013.
The counsel said the petitioner was aggrieved of the illegal dissolution of the local governments without following the procedure of the succeeding legislation in 2019 by which he was deprived of representing his electorate for 22 months as well as subsequent seven months.
He said the petitioner had been denied the legitimate expectation to serve the public interest of his constituents, which was not only against the doctrine of democracy but also infringement of his fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 17 of the Constitution.
The counsel also requested the court to allow the petitioner to become a party to the already pending petitions on similar questions filed by Lord Mayor retired Col Mubashir Javed and others.
Justice Jawad Hassan observed that the petitioners prayed that the term of office of a local government formed under Article 140-A of the Constitution read with provisions of section 30 of the Act of 2013 should be provided to them and the period excluded due to the enactment of the new law in 2019 be added to tenure to complete their five years.
Therefore, the judge issued a notice to the principal law officer of Punjab to respond to legal questions raised in the petition.
The judge adjourned the hearing till Dec 15 and directed a law officer to ensure submission of the report and parawise comments on behalf of all the respondents on or before the next date.

The working of the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) reportedly has come to a grinding halt because of the FIA action.
No arrest has been made so far in this regard.
The board members on Wednesday held a meeting here with Dr Aamer Ahmad in the chair. ETPB Secretary Hamid Masood Gondal briefed the meeting about the FIA’s forensic audit and its action against the board’s officials on the Supreme Court’s orders (in illegal sale or award on lease of urban properties).
According to the board, Dr Ahmad said the apex court had ordered the FIA to conduct ‘more investigation’ as the audit team had not met the legal requirements while composing them.
“The one-man commission had not met legal requirements before submitting the report before the apex court. There is a proper procedure for forensic audit which was not adopted,” Dr Ahmad said and added that because of the FIA’s cases, the board officials were in fear and (those nominated) had secured pre-arrest bail.
The board chief further said that audit paras were not a “final verdict”. “We have written to the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) office and also a review petition has been filed in the Supreme Court,” he said.
On the other hand, the FIA has registered a total 12 FIRs against two former ETPB chiefs -- Siddiqul Farooq and Asif Hahmi – 15 incumbent officials and five retired ones for their role in illegal award of urban properties on lease or their selling, so far.
Mr Farooq and Mr Hashmi are associated with the PML-N and the PPP, respectively.
The FIA has registered most FIRs under sections 409 (criminal breach of trust, dishonest misappropriation of property), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 109 (abatement) PPC r/w 5(2)47 PCA.
A source said some of the ETPB officials nominated in the FIRs had gone into hiding.
“A couple of them even managed to leave the country,” he said.
In the letter to AGP, the ETPB had sought convening of a ‘mandatory’ departmental accounts committee (DAC) of the ministry on its observations to have a black and white picture of the asymmetries.

10,Officer penalised for ‘being on duty’ in Lahore,The transferred officer says she has explained her position.,"LAHORE: Chief Minister Usman Buzdar paid a surprise visit to the tourism office and transferred the additional secretary “for being absent from duty” while being oblivious to the fact that the officer held the additional charge of the TDCP MD and was performing her duties in that capacity at that time.
Tourism Department additional secretary Kalsoom Saqib was meeting an official delegation of civil officers, undergoing training at NIPA for their promotion from BS-18 to BS-19, at her MD TDCP office, when the chief minister “raided” the tourism department. The chief minister conducted a “surprise visit” to the head office of the tourism department on Tuesday morning and made administrative secretary retired Capt Mushtaq Ahmad and additional secretary Kalsoom Saqib OSD. Both the officers were directed to report to the S&GAD for further orders. Other absent officers were suspended from service.
The government also relieved Ms Saqib of the additional charge of the post of Managing Director, Tourism Development Corporation Punjab (TDCP).
Soon after her transfer, Ms Saqib took to her Facebook account and posted her transfer order alongside a group photo with the trainee officers outside her MD TDCP office. She wrote in her post: “What a day when you are made OSD for being on duty. These are strange times but got absolutely bizarre today”. She also thanked her team at the tourism department stating: “Nonetheless it was a great opportunity to do my bit for putting Tourism on the map. Great team, whom I will always adore,” she said.

The transferred officer says she has explained her position

Ms Saqib told Dawn that she had explained her position to her seniors in the government and she could not do anything more being a civil servant. “I am waiting for the instructions from the S&GAD for now,” she said.
Ms Saqib said she was explaining the working and scope of the TDCP to the senior trainee officers at her MD office in Johar Town and the tourism department is located at Shadman Colony.
Principal Secretary to Chief Minister Aamir Jan opted to stay mum when asked whether the chief minister, principal secretary and the entire CM office did not know that Ms Saqib was holding the additional charge of the MD TDCP and she could have been there to perform her duties. In her order, she was also relieved of her additional charge.
Mr Jan neither responded to a call nor text message.
A senior officer in the CM office on the condition of anonymity commented that either the CM office was unaware or the information was deliberately kept secret to embarrass the chief minister. The Punjab government is already facing governance issues.
Officials say Mr Buzdar has tried to imitate former chief minister Shehbaz Sharif by making surprise raids on government offices and suspending senior officers but failed to set an example at the very outset. On Wednesday, the chief minister paid a surprise visit to his own office and inspected the attendance, pace of file work and disposal of summaries. He directed the staff to observe office timings and official discipline. He met Adviser Hanif Pitafi, MPA Tahir Randhawa and others at the DS office and made his way to the conference room to discuss the agenda with the participants in the staff meeting.
While directing to take quick action on files being forwarded to the CMO, Mr Buzdar asked the staff to ensure early disposal of the summaries. Similarly, he stressed that the problems of visitors should be timely solved while treating them with respect.

A spokesperson for the PU said the students were suspended from attending classes and a disciplinary committee would conduct a further inquiry into the incident. He said the administration was following a clear policy and would not allow anyone to breach the peaceful environment and create a law and order situation.
He said strict action would be taken against the suspect involved in the case.

13,Sialkot lynching: More suspects remanded in police custody,Bar refuses to represent lynching suspects.,"NAROWAL: The Sialkot police on Wednesday presented eight more suspects in the murder case of Sri Lankan national Priyantha Kumara in an anti-terrorism court.
These workers of the factory where the deceased was a senior manager were presented in the Gujranwala anti-terrorism court that remanded them in police custody for 13 days. The court ordered police to present the suspects in court again on Dec 21.
The suspects were arrested with the help of CCTV footage. They were suspected of torturing the deceased Sri Lankan national on the roof of the factory, dragging his body on the road and later setting it on fire.
Two days ago, the police had obtained a 15-day physical remand of 26 suspects from the anti-terrorism court. They are suspected to have incited factory workers against Kumara.

Bar refuses to represent lynching suspects

Sources said the police also arrested suspects belonging to other districts, including Sialkot, Gujrat, Narowal, Lodhran, Rahim Yar Khan and Gujranwala. The law enforcers are identifying suspects through CCTV footage and arresting them using mobile phone data and other technological means.
So far, 345 workers of Rajco Industries have been arrested and shifted to an unidentified location for interrogation. Raids are being conducted in other districts, including Sialkot, to arrest more workers. Police have presented 34 suspects in the anti-terrorism court after conducting an identity parade.
The Sialkot District Bar Association meanwhile has refused to take up the case of suspects in the case.
Expressing grief over the ghastly incident, the majority in a meeting of the association on Wednesday decided that no lawyer would pursue the case on behalf of the suspects.
Sialkot Chamber of Commerce and Industry expressed sorrow over the killing of Mr Kumara. Qasim Malik, the chamber’s vice president, while talking to the media said the killing had dealt a major blow to the local industry. A meeting of businessmen in Sialkot was held that decided to provide financial assistance of Rs17.3 million and the monthly salary of the deceased to his family.
Mr Malik said the chamber was also launching a training and counselling campaign for workers, adding that desks would be set up in factories where workers could register their complaints. The respective human resource department would take immediate notice of the complaints so that such incidents could be prevented in the future.
On the other hand, the attendance of workers in Rajco Industries remained low on the second consecutive day.

Dr Hussain, who served as adviser to the prime minister on institutional reforms and austerity, spoke as the chief guest at the launch of book “Covid-19 Crisis & Asian Migration” edited by Dr Nasra M. Shah, at the Lahore School of Economics, Burki Campus.
Dr Azam Amjad Chaudhry, HoD and Dean of Faculty of Economics, opened the proceedings of the launch. Dr Hussain highlighted the population dynamics of Pakistan and advanced economies, and the employment opportunities that may arise from these. He elaborated that Japan and Europe were facing a decline in population growth which will materialise into shortage of labour.
Pakistan that has a growing population and labour force can make up for the shortage in these economies but the ability to exploit that opportunity rests on being able to identify the relevant sectors and building the required skill sets. He raised important questions for future policy and research.
As for Saudi Arabia, host to the largest Pakistani migrant workers, he drew attention to the implications of liberalisation happening in the country on the outflows of migrants from Pakistan and the living conditions of all migrant workers in general.
He also touched upon the issue of stigmatisation of migrant workers in the host countries and xenophobia. On the subject of remittances, he pointed out that while the macroeconomic linkages and importance has been well established, there is need to evaluate the consumption patterns of these remittances by households.
Dr Nasra Shah, Coordinator CIMRAD and Professor at Graduate Institute of Development Studies (GIDS), presented an overview of the book.
