1,Over 50pc of people hold govt incompetence responsible for inflation: Transparency,"Survey conducted in all the provinces ranks police as the most corrupt sector, followed by judiciary","ISLAMABAD: More than 50 per cent of Pakistanis believe that the country is facing problems of rising inflation and unemployment due to the “incompetence” of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government, according to a nationwide perceptions survey conducted by Transparency International (TI).  
The survey was released by Trans­parency International on Wednesday titled “National Corruption Perception Survey (NCPS) 2021”.   
The survey says 50.6pc Pakistanis see government’s incompetence behind the rising inflation whereas 23.3pc citizens consider corruption as the main reason for their economic woes.  

Survey conducted in all the provinces ranks police as the most corrupt sector, followed by judiciary 

The survey further says that 16.6pc people are of the view that lack of implementation of policies is the main reason for the rising inflation in the country. 
The survey shows that a majority of Pakistanis (66.8pc) consider the present government’s accountability drive as partial. 
The survey was conducted in the four provinces from October 14 to 27 this year, with 1,600 respondents. 
The survey revealed that police remain the most corrupt sector, judiciary was seen as second-most corrupt, tendering and contracting third most corrupt while health sector has become the fourth most corrupt since the last NCPS conducted in 2011. 
According to Judicial Statistics of Pakistan 2020 report by National Judicial (Policy Making) Committee, there are 46,698 cases pending in Supreme Court and 1,772,990 cases pending in district judiciary. 
A vast majority (85.9pc) of people considered the federal government’s self-accountability to be unsatisfactory. 
Three most important causes of corruption, according to the NCPS, 2021, are weak accountability (51.9pc), greed of powerful people (29.3pc) and low salaries (18.8pc). 
When asked to suggest measures to reduce corruption, 40.1pc people say increase or stringent punishments for corruption cases, 34.6pc people say accountability of public officers by expediting NAB’s handling of corruption cases and 25.3pc say complete ban on those convicted in corruption from holding public office are key to combat corruption in Pakistan. 
The survey also sheds light on local government and how its presence could have helped Pakistan establish a firmer grip on the situation arising out of Covid-19. About 47.8pc of Pakistanis considered that if local elected representatives were in place, Covid-19 public awareness campaigns could have been launched in an effective manner. 
As many as 89.1pc of Pakistanis say they did not pay any bribe to any government official during the federal government’s Covid-19 relief efforts for deserving citizens. A significant population (81.4pc) has declined that they willingly pay bribe and likewise it was a clear perception that bribes are rather extorted from the public through tactics such as inaction or delay, in the provision of public services. 
Compared to the three federal governments, majority of Pakistanis (92.9pc) consider inflation and price hike to be the highest in the current PTI government, compared to 4.6pc in the PML-N government (2013-18) and 2.5pc in the PPP government (2008-13). This coincides with 85.9pc Pakistanis who say that their income levels have rather squeezed and decreased over the last three years. 
The list of public services for which people had to pay bribes, according to the corruption perception survey, was topped by contracts of roads (59.8pc), cleanliness and garbage collection (13.8pc), access to water (13.3pc) and drainage system (13.1pc).

2,"Govt suggests probe into verdicts, manoeuvring of four decades",ISLAMABAD: The government on Wednes­day proposed an investigation into manipulated court verdicts and political...,"ISLAMABAD: The government on Wednes­day proposed an investigation into manipulated court verdicts and political engineering carried out over the last 40 years. 
During the hearing of a petition filed by Sindh High Court Bar Association (SHCBA) president Salahuddin Ahmed, Attorney General (AG) Khalid Jawed Khan suggested the petitioner to amend the petition and instead of seeking probe into incidents that occurred in the last five years, should demand inquiry into Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s murder trial, toppling of successive governments and attacks on judiciary. 
The late former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, and Nawaz Sharif had agreed to establish the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in their Charter of Democracy (COD) “to acknowledge victims of torture, imprisonment, state-sponsored persecution, targeted legislation and politically-motivated accountability and to examine and report its findings on military coups and civil removals of governments from 1996”. 
“It appears that both the petitioner and attorney general are on the same page as they seek judiciary’s accountability,” IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah said. 
Attorney General Khan argued that the present petition of the SHCBA appeared to be a proxy since the events mentioned in the petition were related to a pending appeal. He was referring to Maryam Nawaz’s appeal against her conviction in the Avenfield Apartment reference. 
Mr Khan said after the conviction, they had started indiscriminate attacks on the judiciary adding that “this is the season of assailing and attacking the judiciary”. 
The IHC chief justice remarked that no aspersion could be cast on the integrity of the petitioner and said, “Salahuddin’s bona fide credentials are established”. 
The petitioner was seeking constitution of an independent commission to ascertain the veracity of the letter of former Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) chairman Zafar Hijazi in which he accused the then Supreme Court registrar of issuing instructions for nomination of Bilal Rasool as JIT member to investigate assets of the Sharif family.  
AG Khan proposed that instead of seeking inquiry into recent events, the petitioner should amend the prayer and include probe into the hanging of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, toppling of democratic regimes, securing favourable verdicts from the judiciary, removal of former chief justice of Pakistan Sajjad Ali Shah, audio leak of retired Justice Malik Qayyum and so on.
