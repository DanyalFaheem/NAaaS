0,RED ZONE FILES: All rise for the PPP,"PPP is displaying sharp, smart politics at a time when other bigger parties are hacking away at branches they are perched on.","Asif Zardari knows his politics like Babar Azam knows his batting: see space between the players, will cover drive for a boundary. 
So it is that after years of being kicked around in the wilderness, and of being mocked for mal-governance and corruption, and also for reducing a national giant into a regional pygmy, it now transpires that the former president has dragged the party back bang centre into the mainstream of politics.

The impressive showing in the NA-133 Lahore election is just the latest evidence of what is increasingly being seen as a display of smart and sharp politics by the PPP at a time when other bigger parties are hacking away at the branches they are perched on. 
The PPP has not had the last laugh yet. But if you listen closely, you may hear the faint sound of a few triumphant chuckles. Aik Zardari sub per…? 
As the former president laboured through the legal and political maze these last few years, he kept on dropping clues — bread crumbs like Hansel and Gretel, if you like fairy tales — on his way to a destination known probably only to him. Many moons ago he ducked and dodged expectations to bring down a government in Balochistan, then some moons later he swiveled and pivoted to help elect Sadiq Sanjrani as Senate chairman, and followed this up even more moons later by spinning and swerving to first get Yousaf Raza Gilani elected from the Islamabad seat in the Senate, and then pulling another rabbit out of his electoral hat to plant him as leader of the opposition. When he did not have the numbers, he had the smarts; and when he did not have the support, he had the nerve. 
But this was small game. This was net practice. This was a warm up match. Till now. 
Now is when the PPP is unveiling its real plan, and making opponents stare in wonderment. The wheels are moving slowly but surely as the political situation churns itself into a muddy quagmire. There is still a yawning gap between what the PPP lusts for and what it may end up with, but the intensity of desire is now increasingly being matched by the requisite political prowess. 
Read more: PPP to participate in local govt polls, says Zardari 
PPP took the initiative to form the PDM in 2020. Yes, the PML-N and the JUI-F were equally amenable to the alliance but it was Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and the party leadership that really pushed for this grand joining of hands and the charter of demands that followed. While the optics of these parties partnering was important, it was the timing that was critical. The PPP leadership sensed it right and stitched up the team smoothly and swiftly. 
More than a year later, it has become clear that not only was the PPP right to pilot the PDM into a successful start, it was also right in defying the majority opinion within the alliance and refuse to resign from the assemblies. Today, after suffering the highs and lows of an anti-government campaign that appears running on a treadmill — breaking sweat but going nowhere — the PML-N has reached a conclusion about not to use the resignation option that the PPP had argued nearly a year ago. 
Editorial: PDM appears to be more of a pressure group than a real threat to the govt
If someone is smirking in Bilawal house, he has a right to. He also has the right to play his own game because, well, clearly he is playing it better than the others. And the game? Here’s where dreams and desires segue into plans and policy. The PPP knows it has Sindh and will keep it. What it wants is a piece of Punjab, a chunk of KP and the largest slice of the Centre. 
Whoa! Did you just do a double take? Welcome to the club. Here’s how it is unfolding: 

The PPP sensed early on that the PML-N was becoming a prisoner of its own politics. By adopting an extreme position against the establishment, and by dressing up this position in ideological terms, and by going where no politician had gone before by naming the army chief and ISI DG in rallies, Nawaz Sharif had played a gambler’s hand. The PPP also sensed that the only way for Nawaz from here on was to escalate and escalate till something snapped. On the other side of the spectrum, the PPP leadership calculated that given the dynamics of Pakistani politics — and who knows these better than the PPP — a rupture between the PTI government and the establishment was inevitable. On both counts, as it turns out, the party leadership was spot on. 
Armed with this assessment, the PPP leadership started placing itself in an advantageous position much before others even knew what was happening. The subtle engagement with the establishment, the not-so-private disagreement with the PML-N over naming names of generals, and the public refusal to upset the applecart by resigning from the assemblies, all these steps were meant to showcase the PPP as a party that was willing to play ball without willing to play dead. By the time the PPP walked out of the PDM, PTI’s graph had also begun to slide down as a result of its inability to command effective governance. You could hear people asking in hushed whispers: What now? Who now? 
The PPP had answers: what now? In-house change in Punjab and Centre. Who now? PPP in Islamabad and PML-N in Punjab. Did they have the numbers early in 2021 when the PPP floated this idea and pushed for it? Not really. Did it think it could conjure them from its magic hat? It absolutely did. Something was cooking. But the PML-N had no appetite. It was still on the gambling table playing for all-or-nothing: elections now or no deal. So there was no deal. 
But PPP is all about the art of a deal. So while the PDM of the JUI-F and PML-N sulked in the desolation of its own dreams, the PPP rolled up its sleeves and went to work. The first target was south Punjab. This is where the party has traditionally bagged seats and retains a semblance of support. South Punjab offers a bonanza of National Assembly seats — nearly four dozen — and the politics here is driven by electables. In the heyday of PML-N most of them linked up with the Sharif bandwagon and many had bagged cabinet positions. Then suddenly, without warning and at literally the last minute prior to the 2018 elections, a large chunk of them galloped across to the PTI. The PPP knows well they can all gallop back given the right nudge, push and wink. Which is why the party started working on the nudgers, pushers and winkers before anyone knew what was happening. 
Makhdum Ahmad Mahmud has guarded the PPP citadel in south Punjab alone these years. And he’s guarded it well. He retains his solid standing in the area and commands at least one National Assembly and two provincial assembly seats. He is also related to Jehangir Tareen. They were also business partners. Tareen commands significant influence in the south and is nowadays keeping his cards very close to his chest. The PPP is very interested in him because if he and Ahmad Mahmood partner up, and they have the wind from Rawalpindi in their sails, they can reap a rich harvest of seats to add to the tally that the PPP needs to weave magic in the Centre. Is something cooking? Insiders say the pot may not be on the stove but the stove has been lighted. 
The KP game is also afoot and a gentle wind is helping with a kindred spirit. Look out for politically potent people joining the PPP in the coming weeks and months. A few already have. The formula therefore is slowly taking shape: Sindh + South Punjab + KP + Kindred Wind + Post-election allies + Independents-sniffing-the-wind = Bright chance for a slim majority in the Centre. Game on hai. 

As Prime Minister Imran Khan is fond of saying: dream big. The PPP has rejected his politics but may have accepted his words.

4,Ehsaas initiative set to get $600m ADB support,Loan from Asian Development Bank will finance a results-based programme to strengthen and expand social protection network.,"ISLAMABAD: The Asian Development Bank (ADB) on Wednesday approved a $603 million loan to support Ehsaas social protection programme. 
According to an ADB statement, the loan would finance results-based programme to strengthen and expand social protection network. Using conditional cash transfers, the programme will support the implementation of Ehsaas, Pakistan’s national social protection and poverty reduction strategy. 
Under the Integrated Social Protection Development Programme, the ADB will provide a regular loan of $600m and a $3m grant from the Asian Development Fund, and will administer a $24m grant from the Education Above All Foundation. 
“The programme marks a significant shift in ADB’s strategic engagement in the social protection space in Pakistan in line with Ehsaas priorities,” said Yevgeniy Zhukov, ADB Director General for Central and West Asia. 
“The ADB’s support will transition from unconditional cash transfers that provide income support to a mixed-modality approach that focuses more on conditional cash transfers for education, health services and nutritional supplies that will help reduce intergenerational poverty through human capital development,” he added. 
The programme supports the Ehsaas goal of expanding cash transfers to improve access to primary and secondary education up to grade 10 for children and adolescents of poor families, especially girls, and enhancing health services and nutrition for women, adolescent girls and poor children. 
It also aims to initiate coverage of accelerated learning programmes at the primary education level for overage out-of-school children under conditional cash transfers. 
In addition, the programme supports improvements in implementation and fiduciary capacity for Pakistan’s social protection programmes. 
“ADB is a trusted and longstanding partner. This programme is the result of years of engagement with the Asian Bank and other partners and focuses on areas where we believe the bank can have most impact. It is a key priority under the government’s Ehsaas strategy,” said Dr Sania Nishtar, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Social Protection and Poverty Alleviation.

6,SC judge raises questions about judiciary’s independence if legislature reverses its decisions,SC is set to resume hearing today on petitions by government employees sacked after court's August 17 judgement.,"ISLAMABAD: The judiciary’s independence will be in jeopardy if parliament starts violating fundamental principles by reversing court decisions, Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah said in his remarks on Wednesday during the hearing of a set of petitions seeking review of the Supreme Court’s Aug 17 judgement which rendered almost 17,000 government employees jobless.
The observation came after senior counsel Sardar Latif Khosa stated that the real purpose behind enacting the Sacked Employees (Reinstatement) Ordinance Act 2010 (SERA) was to end the “political culture of victimising employees” appointed by the PPP governments because “we understand the pulse of the nation”.
The counsel, who represents the State Life Insurance Corporation and the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) in the case, said the PPP government was committed to reinstating the employees through a legislative instrument. 
He recalled that military governments had even removed judges, but it was the PPP which restored their services through executive orders.
“Today a large number of people are waiting outside the Supreme Court, but nobody except for parliamentarians reaches out to them,” the counsel argued. 
On the eve of his retirement, Justice Mushir Alam had on Aug 17 declared as illegal and unconstitutional the PPP-era law, the Sacked Employees (Reinstatement) Ordinance Act 2010, under which thousands of individuals were employed or promoted.
But the Supreme Court bench took exception to their “reinstatement through a special law enacted by parliament in disregard of others employees”, recalling that the courts had turned down a number of petitions seeking repeal of the sacking orders.
The appointment or reinstatement of the employees should have been done after meeting certain conditions, the court said. The law in question (SERA) never cited instances of victimisation as reason for reinstating the employees.
Justice Umar Ata Bandial, who headed the Supreme Court bench, said it was unfortunate that SERA treated the termination of services as a ground for regularisation of these employees in 2009 and 2010.
Attorney General (AGP) Khalid Jawed Khan proposed that the Supreme Court consider only those cases that concerned employees who were reinstated through SERA and return the cases of those who were reinstated through previous ordinances to the high courts concerned.
But it was Advocate Shahbaz Khosa, the son of Sardar Latif Khosa, who swung the course of the case when he said most of the employees were reinstated through previous ordinances and though ordinances lapse one after the other, the benefit enjoyed by the employees were protected under Article 264 of the Constitution through the 18th Amendment. 
“The provision ensures that the repeal, or lapse, of a law will have no effect to any right, privilege, obligation accrued under the previous law.”
Shahbaz Khosa emphasised that his case was pending before the Sindh High Court, but the departments concerned dismissed some of the employees only because of the Aug 17 Supreme Court judgement.
Shahbaz Khosa argued that Article 8 of the Constitution had laid down that no law could be struck down in toto. Only those sections could be declared illegal which violate fundamental rights.
Justice Shah, however, observed that the court would have to determine what effect the repeal of the act would have on the vires of the ordinance since the pith and substance of the two legal instruments were identical.
Justice Bandial asked the attorney general to assist the Supreme Court in pre-determining the impact of declaring SERA illegal on the employees reinstated through ordinances. 
He also asked the AGP to assist the bench in determining whether the due process was carried out before induction of the employees. 
Justice Bandial said the counsel representing the Intelligence Bureau (IB) and the SNGPL had argued that their clients had come up to the criteria for appointment.
But if it was found that some of the selected were not up to the mark, Justice Bandial wondered, would it amount to violation of Article 25 of the Constitution, which ensures equality of citizens.
The hearing will resume on Thursday (today).

7,"Decision about Reko Diq to be taken in March, says CM Bizenjo","“The entire assembly will be informed whatever decision is taken on Reko Diq,"" says Balochistan's chief minister.","QUETTA: Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo has said that a decision about the Reko Diq copper-gold project will be taken before March next year. 
Speaking at a ceremony on Tuesday for distribution of appointment letters among 1,493 male and female teachers of Global Partnership for Education-Balochistan Education Project, the chief minister said the Reko Diq project was an important asset of the province. 
The Balochistan Assembly had recently adopted a resolution on the Reko Diq issue. 
The resolution warned that no accord about the future of Reko-Diq would be accepted without taking Balochistan’s elected representatives and the provincial government on board. 
Members from the opposition and the treasury benches demanded an in-camera briefing on the future of Reko Diq project, expressing and apprehension that an agreement might be signed by the federal government without taking the Balochistan Assembly and the government into confidence.
Mr Bizenjo said: “The entire assembly will be informed whatever decision is taken on Reko Diq.” He said that due to the change of government in Afghanistan some incidents of terrorism had occurred in Balochistan. 
“We are not sleeping and soon the elements involved in these terrorist incidents would be exposed and brought to justice,” he said. It was the government’s responsibility to provide security to the people and his government would fulfil its responsibilities, he added. 
The chief minister said his government had done no favour to the teachers by giving them appointment letters as it was their right. He said the previous government should be asked why it did not pay any attention to the sit-ins staged by these teachers. “I thank Allah for giving me an opportunity for resolving problems of these people.”
