0,Schools reopen today in Islamabad after ministry assures teachers to address their concerns,"Notification on proposed placement of schools under mayor withdrawn, matter to be taken up with federal govt.","ISLAMABAD: Schools in the capital will reopen from Thursday (today) after teachers and non-teaching staff were assured by the Ministry of Education that their concerns regarding the Local Government Ordinance will be removed.
The teaching and non-teaching staff of all schools had boycotted classes since last Tuesday as they protested against the Local Government Ordinance 2021, which states that Federal Directorate of Education (FDE) — the regulatory body of schools and colleges — will be placed under control of the mayor.
Besides protesting against the said ordinance, teachers were also criticising the Ministry of Education for its move of separating 33 colleges from the FDE, apparently, to avoid their devolution to the local government.
The ministry on Wednesday withdrew the said notification and also assured protesters that it will take up their concerns with the federal government.

Notification on proposed placement of schools under mayor withdrawn, matter to be taken up with federal govt

Secretary (Education) Naheed Durrani and Additional Secretary Mohaiyyuddin Ahmed Wani played the main role in convincing teachers to call off their strike as over 200,000 students, who have already faced huge educational loss during the Covid-19 pandemic, have been suffering since last Tuesday.
“Yes, we have decided to call off our strike and schools will be reopened from Thursday. We are thankful to Education Minister Shafqat Mahmood and other officers of education ministry for listening to our voices. We have two demands: removal of section 166 from Local Government Ordinance and withdrawal of the notification of separating 33 colleges from FDE. One of our demands has been accepted through notification, while we were assured that the ministry will take up our case with the federal government,” said president of School Teachers Association Malik Ameer Khan.
He said if the section was not removed from the ordinance, teachers will go on strike again, adding, after holding meetings with all employees of schools we will set a deadline for the government to remove section 166 from the ordinance. 
The teachers’ strike was also discussed in the National Assembly Standing Committee on Education, which met here with MNA Mian Najeebuddin Awaisi in the chair. 
The committee unanimously asked teachers to call off their strike.
Meanwhile, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) Ali Nawaz Awan while addressing a press conference said all rights of teaching and non-teaching staff are protected. 
However, he said the elected mayor, a representative of over 2 million people will have the right to playing a guiding role in the education sector. 
Teachers’ concerns will be addressed but there is no need to keep schools closed, he added. 
Earlier, the Senate Standing Committee on Education had also urged teachers to call off their strike.
Meanwhile, a press release issued by the education ministry stated: “The ministry officials on behalf and direction of the minister assured the representatives of the association that the government is fully aware of their reservations and will ensure that all their service matters will be dealt by the federal government through ministry of education under civil servants act and no measure will be taken to alter their terms and conditions of service to their disadvantage”.
The time of students is of immense importance which is why schools will be opened on Dec 9.
The joint action committee and the ministry will continue to raise this issue at every forum without further disrupting educational activities and both parties agreed to remain engaged in the interest of students, the press release said.

3,"NCOC, EPI collaborate to administer Covid-19 vaccine to children over 12","ISLAMABAD: Declaring 31 districts of Pakistan high risk for Covid-19, the National Command and Operation Centre...","ISLAMABAD: Declaring 31 districts of Pakistan high risk for Covid-19, the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) has joined hands with the Expanded Programme of Immunisation (EPI) to inoculate children over the age of 12 at their doorsteps.
Moreover, EPI has finalised arrangements to vaccinate 40 million children up to the age of five against polio across the country. The three-day polio campaign will begin on Dec 10 (today) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and on Dec 13 in other parts of the country.
According to a document, available with Dawn, the Covid-19 vaccine will be administered in 11 districts of Punjab, 10 districts of Sindh, nine districts of KP and in one district of Balochistan. 
It shows that there are 62 million vaccine-eligible people in 11 districts of Punjab including Lahore, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Multan, Rahim Yar Khan, Sialkot, Muzaffargarh, Sargodha, Bahawalpur and Dera Ghazi Khan.
Over 25 million vaccine-eligible people are in 10 districts of Sindh including central, east, south, west, Kaemari, Korangi, Malir, Hyderabad, Khairpur and Sanghar.
Over eight million people are in nine districts of KP including Mardan, Peshawar, Swat, Swabi, D.I. Khan, Charsadda, Mansehra, Nowshera and Abbottabad. Quetta is the only district of Balochistan where 2.6 million people are vaccine-eligible.
According to a statement, during the campaign, children will receive a supplementary dose of vitamin-A capsules along with the polio vaccine. The polio programme will also facilitate the process of Covid-19 vaccination.
Children between the ages of 12 to 18 will receive the Pfizer vaccine while Sinovac will be administrated to the 18-plus population in 31 high-risk districts identified by the NCOC. The NCOC and health expert committee have already approved both vaccines.
While launching the campaign, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health Dr Faisal Sultan said current gains demand substantial and sustained efforts to further boost the progress achieved over the years, towards polio eradication. The programme will reach every eligible child with the polio vaccine to solidify this progress. Parents should open their doors to polio workers and get their children vaccinated.
“After protecting their precious children under five from polio, the parents and all children over 12 years should then go to one of the more than 13,000 temporary vaccine sites for vaccination and protection of themselves against the Covid-19 disease,” Dr Sultan said.
More than 290,000 frontline health workers will go house-to-house for vaccination ensuring children’s protection from the deadly poliovirus. Among other health issues, unfortunately, more than 50pc of children in Pakistan have a vitamin-A deficiency, which exposes them to various other diseases, including diarrhoea, pneumonia, measles and night blindness. 
Adding a dose of vitamin-A in the immunisation campaign will contribute towards improving immunity of these vulnerable children.
Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only two countries left with the poliovirus. Unvaccinated children on both sides of the border are at imminent risk.
“We are aware of the risks of cross-border circulation of the virus between the two countries and we are now focused more on further strengthening our robust mechanisms and strategies to address the issue,” said Dr Shahzad Baig, coordinator of the Pakistan Polio Eradication Initiative. 
“The programme will ensure that the upcoming immunisation campaign achieves all its targets while also taking steps to monitor cross border movement and enhancing security for health workers in high-risk areas, as well as supporting the Covid-19 vaccination drive,” he added.

A ceremony was held at the Chinese embassy, which was attended by officials of the Chinese government, Ministry of Climate Change and National Highway Authority.
Speaking at the ceremony, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam appreciated China’s support to the flagship TBTTP programme and welcomed the gift of 7,000 saplings plantation to commemorate 70 years of friendly ties between the two countries.
The special assistant and Chinese Ambassador Nong Rong together planted a pine tree sapling at the Chinese embassy and exchanged views on the green vision of both sides aimed at sustainable growth and environmental conservation.
Mr Aslam thanked the Chinese envoy and said the COP26 was an interesting global moot on climate change that could not live up to all expectations.
He said the announcement of Chinese President Xi Jinping at COP26 was promising as China pledged not to invest in any coal power project abroad.
“China should have had an aggressive presence at the COP26 to project its inspiring story of transition from coal to renewable eco-friendly solutions. CPEC Green Corridor was also part of Pakistan’s vision along with China,” he underlined.
The special assistant highlighted that the US-China pledge on mitigating methane at the end of COP26 was also well received globally.
Speaking on the occasion, Chinese Ambassador Nong Rong congratulated the special assistant for his successful participation at COP26 and said China had positive intentions to enhance green partnership for ecological conservation.
He said the Chinese embassy formally joined Prime Minister Imran Khan’s flagship TBTTP on this occasion. “China also has nuclear, solar, hydro and wind power plants apart from coal power plants and can contribute to the renewable energy transition,” he added.
Highlighting the importance of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project, he said Beijing had diverted one third of its electricity to CPEC-related projects at cheaper rates.

5,Samar Minallah bags another award for short film,ISLAMABAD: Pakistani filmmaker and anthropologist Samar Minallah won an international award for her short film Out...,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistani filmmaker and anthropologist Samar Minallah won an international award for her short film Out Swing which was declared the best short film at the 7th Sport Film Festival in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.
The win was announced on Twitter where the film creator was lauded for her work.
After the announcement of the winner of the 7th Sport Film Festival, Ms Minallah received many congratulations on social media across the globe.
The short, which is posted on Vimeo, is described as: “On the outskirts of Islamabad, a committed coach teaches a team of unlikely players, their families and a community how playing Cricket can change lives.”
The documentary trails a devoted coach who teaches cricket to young girls who find comfort and strength in learning the sport. The girls hail from traditional families where the youngest, at nine years old, wants to overcome her fears, anxiety and personal battles with the help of school and cricket.
In cricket terminology, out-swing means something that moves away from the lines of bowling. It comes with the risks of being called a wide ball but it could also be a game changer for the team.
Similarly, the coach in the film goes against the odds risking his life, with the girls ‘moving away’ from the norms and traditions women are expected to follow.
Samar Minallah’s other works include Swara — A Bridge over Troubled Waters, a documentary that raised questions around the practice that violates rights of a girl child and women. Swara is a term associated with forced marriages. The documentary gained international recognition for highlighting a sensitive yet important topic and drawing attention towards “compensation marriages”.
Minallah has won several international awards including Premio Roberto Rossellini 2009, The DVF Award 2015, and UNICEF Child Rights Award.

11,IOs to face contempt case for causing delay in disposal of cases: IHC,"Rs50,000 fine imposed on SDPO, SHO Ramna for not submitting record against under-trial prisoner...","ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday warned the police of initiating contempt of court proceedings against the investigating officers (IOs) for causing delay in disposal of cases.
Expressing displeasure over lethargy of Islamabad police in producing record, IHC Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri said it hindered timely release of the under trial prisoners (UTPs).
The IHC judge accepting the petition seeking post arrest bail of an accused imposed Rs50,000 fine on the Sub Division Police Officer (SDPO) and SHO Ramna for not submitting the record against the UTP.
Justice Jahangiri was hearing the bail petition of Mohammad Noman Khan facing fraud case registered against him on June 1 for not returning the rented car.
It has been alleged that the accused took a car from a showroom for two days but did not return it.

Rs50,000 fine imposed on SDPO, SHO Ramna for not submitting record against under-trial prisoner

Petitioner contended that he was innocent and had been implicated in this case with mala fide intentions; he has no concern with the alleged offence and no direct or indirect evidence was available against him.
State counsel opposed the bail petition and argued that the accused has committed a heinous crime and sufficient evidence is available on record which connects him with the commission of alleged offence adding that the accused was also involved in other cases of similar nature, hence he is not entitled to bail after arrest.
The court noted that the complainant – showroom’s owner - had handed over a car to the accused but he could not produce any evidence which could prove that the complainant was the owner of the car.
Investigating officer stated that there was no evidence against the petitioner except for the statement of the complainant.
The petition for bail after arrest was fixed for arguments on Dec 3, but investigating officer did not produce record of the case before the court, so the case was adjourned for Dec 12.
Justice Jahangiri after examining the record granted the post arrest bail to the accused on Wednesday observing that had the investigating officer produced the record on Dec 3, the petitioner would have been granted bail on the same day.
The court directed SP Saddar Zone to conduct an inquiry and fix the responsibility for delay in production of the record.
“Though there is no compensation for the incarceration of two days in prison but the concerned SDPO and SHO are directed to pay Rs50,000 as a token of compensation / fine to the accused / petitioner when he is released from the jail,” ordered the judge.
The court directed to send the copy of the order to the Inspector General of Police, Islamabad and warned “in future if the record is not produced before this court, strict action against the investigating officer concerned and their supervisory officers will be taken which may also entail contempt of court proceedings.”
