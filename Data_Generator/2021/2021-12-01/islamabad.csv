He was speaking at a seminar titled: “Tobacco Harms and Tobacco Industry Tactic” organised by Pakistan National Heart Association (PANAH) at a local hotel.
Mr Suri said that the younger generation started smoking as a fashion and there was a need to stop that unhealthy practice.
He said 170,000 deaths due to tobacco use was a cause of concern and “we should all be part of the PANAH awareness campaign so that diseases can be controlled”. He said: “We will consider the proposals of participants for the legislation.”
Medical Expert Prof Dr Shakeel Ahmad said that there were negative effects of tobacco on human health. He suggested taking collective steps to protect youth from hazards of tobacco.
Vice Chancellor Health Services Academy Dr Shehzad Ali Khan said the tobacco industry gave wrong statistics about illegal trade. “So that is why the tobacco tax could not be increased during the last three years,” he said.
Deputy Director Health Ministry Dr Samra Mazhar said that the government was seriously working on a policy to discourage tobacco use.
Chairperson National Commission on the Rights of the Child Afshan Tehseen Bajwa said that due to the propaganda of tobacco industry 1,200 school going children start smoking daily.
President of PANAH Major (retd) Masood-ur-Rehman Kayani said that the purpose of holding dialogue was to pave the way for legislation in the light of expert opinion. Such dialogues should be held in the future as well, so that the public can be made aware of the dangers of tobacco.
General Secretary and Director Operations PANAH Sanaullah Ghumman said tobacco killed millions of people every year and was a major cause of other deadly diseases including cancer.
“The tobacco industry, as always, justified the illicit trade. It is an attempt to stop the increase in tax. Increase in tobacco product prices will generate billions of rupees in the form of revenue, but will also reduce the burden of tobacco related diseases,” he said.

He said he had not proposed any scheme for the MC Girls School in Bhabra Bazaar but in the documents Rs10 million had been set aside for it.
Raja Mushtaq, Ghayyur Akhtar Butt, Azhar Iqbal Satti, Malik Sultan Mahmood and Raja Hafeez and others criticised unchecked encroachments in the city and alleged that the chief municipal officer and the municipal officer regulations were responsible for it.
“We will clear the city from all temporary, permanent and immovable encroachments in a week if the elected members supported the administration,” said Imran Ali, the municipal officer regulations.
Upon this, the entire house, including the mayor, said there would be no political interference regarding removal of encroachments and directed the municipal officer to take action against encroachments with full powers and the local government representatives would support him.
Mayor Khan said the house would form a committee and divide the city into four sectors so the corporation would work on it without any delay.
The house approved removal of certain parking points in the city from the gazette notification on the resentment of traders and visitors and stopped the corporation from collecting parking fee from there.
These parking points are: the plot of old offices of RMC on City Saddar Road aka Jinnah Road, Fawara Chowk to Dangi Khoi, Iqbal Road from Committee Chowk to Chatian Hatian, Bani Chowk from Jamia Masjid Road to Pul Shah Nazar and 5th Road Rehmanabad Chowk to Tayba Hotel.
The house rejected a resolution of the municipal officer (finance) regarding increase in the general bus stand fee.
The mayor informed the house that for installation of tough tiles and construction of boundary walls in main graveyards Rs80 million had been allocated and the work would be started soon.
“Work on the new graveyard on 1,000 kanals at Rakh Dhamyal has been started at a cost of Rs20 million,” he said.

The RWMC’s seven-year contract with the Turkish company expired on November 30.
Under the contract worth Rs8 billion signed during the tenure of the previous PML-N government in 2015, the Turkish company had taken control of the city’s sanitation system. The RWMC’s human resource department was the incharge of the management with the company having the transport fleet.
As the government did not extend the contract, the RWMC took over the charge of lifting garbage from the garrison city on December 1. RWMC Managing Director Awais Manzoor Tarar said a control room had been set up which will monitor the situation.
“In case of any complaint, citizens should contact our helpline number 1139.”
He said RWMC had taken over the cleaning system of all union councils. He said 1,436 sanitary workers of Albayrak will continue working to dispose of 850 tonnes garbage on a daily basis. More than 4,000 bins have been set up in the city while 210 vehicles will be used in the clean-up operation.
He said no compromise will be made on cleanliness of the city. “The city will have zero waste from today. All resources will be utilised for this,” he said.
“The best standard of cleanliness will be maintained in Rawalpindi. Cleaning is a responsibility for all of us. In order to maintain the beauty of the city, everyone must realise their responsibilities. Don’t dump garbage openly, use the bins and cooperate with our workers to make Rawalpindi clean and green,” he said.
RWMC Chairman Ajmal Sabir Raja said the government had asked the company to take over the sanitation of the city. He said the rights of the workers would be protected.

4,Tributes paid to Ashfaq Saleem Mirza,"ISLAMABAD: Friends, followers and family members of the late philosopher, thinker, critic, poet and translator ...","ISLAMABAD: Friends, followers and family members of the late philosopher, thinker, critic, poet and translator Ashfaq Saleem Mirza on Tuesday recalled his personality and work.
They were attending the launching ceremony of Kuch Yaadein, Kuch Nazmein, a book comprising tributes by friends and scholars along with unpublished poems of late Ashfaq Saleem Mirza (1944-2020). The event was held at a local hotel and moderated by Saqib Siddique.
Mustansar Javed, a noted journalist recollected memories with Mirza in Lahore and Islamabad. He said Mirza was a seeker after the truth and concerned with leading a moral and principled life from the beginning. He was always interested in philosophy and wanted to write texts in philosophy, which he consistently did over the decades, he added. Kishwar Naheed said, “Ashfaq Saleem Mirza’s death has left a void in our lives and in our culture. Mirza was a writer and an artist who also remained a part of the struggle for the democratic rights of the people of the country”.
Harris Khalique, secretary general of Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) and a poet himself likened Mirza to a romantic philosopher for whom it was natural to write poetry.
Renowned historian, Dr Mubarak Ali said Mirza’s books were meticulously researched and thoroughly edited and he consulted original sources and discussed the lives of philosophers in a fresh and engaging manner. His translations were equally impressive and brought to Urdu readers, the works of classical writers. He said as a friend Ashfaq Sahib was always at hand to explain, in accessible terms, arcane philosophical terms.
Writer Dr Ravish Nadeem said the deceased was consistent as a thinker and a writer. Beauty was important to him and he saw aesthetics as the force permeating every sphere of life.

ISLAMABAD: Talks between the protesting teachers and the federal government failed on Tuesday, prompting the former to announce that all schools would remain closed until the government issued an amended Local Government Ordinance to separate the education sector from the local government.
All 390 schools in the federal capital remained closed, affecting around 200,000 students.
The teachers went on strike against the Local Government Ordinance 2021 under which the Federal Directorate of Education (FDE) - the regulatory body of schools - would report to the yet-to-be elected mayor of Islamabad.
Students did not show up in schools on Tuesday morning as they had already been informed about the strike. However, some students who were unaware of the protest reached their institutions and were sent back.

Representative says strike not to be called off until ordinance amended to withdraw placement of schools under mayor

The protesters said after devolving the FDE to the local government, the teachers and other employees would be deprived of many benefits, which they were currently availing because of their status as federal government employees.
A delegation of the protesting teachers headed by their action committee chairman Fazal-i-Mola held separate meetings with Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) Ali Nawaz Awan and Education Secretary Naheed Durrani.
Sources said during the meeting, the special assistant asked the teachers to end their protest as their rights were protected and after being placed under the local government they would remain employees of the federal government.
However, the teachers said until an amendment was made to the ordinance, they would not call off their strike.
“We don’t want to be devolved to the corporation. In the presence of the education ministry, there is no justification for placing the FDE and schools under the local government whose future was still uncertain,” said School Teachers Association President Malik Ameer Khan.
He said during the meeting, the SAPM told teachers that when the FDE would be placed under the administrative control of the mayor, there would be no change in the service structure of the employees working in schools.
“But we are not going to accept this. The ordinance is very clear and states that the local government will manage the primary, elementary and secondary education for all purposes,” Mr Khan said.
“We are very open. The local government through school management committees should keep a check on the performance of schools. The elected mayor should be made part of the education ministry’s selection board for appointing the DG but placing schools under the local government is not acceptable and our protest will continue until an amendment is made to the ordinance,” he said.
Meanwhile, the teachers also held a meeting with the federal education secretary.
They said just two days before the promulgation of the ordinance the ministry, through a notification, placed 33 colleges under the Education College-H-9 to keep them under the administrative control of the ministry.
However, the teachers said the ministry did not consider the concerns of the 390 schools.
The teachers told the secretary that there were also school sections in many of the 33 colleges but the education ministry kept them under the administrative control of the colleges.
The delegation demanded the education secretary to withdraw the notification.
Sources said during the meeting the secretary and other officers of the ministry tried to convince the teachers to call off their strike but to no avail.
The local government elections are expected to be held in March-April next year as currently delimitation of constituencies/wards is continuing.

7,Armed men free property tycoon Nadeem Ijaz from police custody in Pindi,LHC judge had cancelled the tycoon's interim bail earlier in the day.,"RAWALPINDI: A property tycoon who had been on interim bail in a fraud case was freed from police custody by his armed men as he was being driven to the police station on Tuesday after his bail was cancelled by the Lahore High Court Rawalpindi bench.
As the LHC judge announced cancellation of the interim bail of accused Nadeem Ijaz, director of a private housing society, the Chontra police took him into custody. The accused was on interim bail from the LHC till Nov 30.
While he was being driven to the police station, some people in four wheel-drive vehicles carrying guns intercepted the police vehicle outside the LHC Rawalpindi building and freed Nadeem Ijaz from police custody and sped off after firing in the air.
Shahzad Mehmood, a senior official of Metropolitan Directorate Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) had registered an FIR with Chontra police against Chaudhry Nadeem Ijaz and Saad Nazir.
He said in the FIR that he along with his staff went to the site of private housing society and found that the owners of the society had been developing the society on illegal land without getting approval of the RDA. Hence, they had been cheating public which was a violation of the Punjab Development of City Act.
The case was registered against the accused but he had obtained interim bail from the court, which was cancelled on Tuesday.
The City Police Officer (CPO) Athar Ismail directed the SP Saddar Kamran Amir to arrest the culprits within 24 hours.
Police raiding teams were constituted to arrest the escapee and his accomplices, the CPO said, adding that anyone who was found giving shelter to the accused would face legal action.
It took several hours to decide the jurisdiction of the crime scene as the LHC premises is located in the limits of Airport police while the outside area is situated in the Morgah police area.
When contacted, CPO Athar Ismail said that an FIR would be registered against the accused on relevant charges, including offering resistance to the police.
He said police raiding teams have been constituted to arrest the escapee and his accomplices.

9,CDA seeks four-month extension in Korang Bridge project,ISLAMABAD: The expansion of Korang Bridge Project on Islamabad Expressway has been delayed due to various reasons ...,"ISLAMABAD: The expansion of Korang Bridge Project on Islamabad Expressway has been delayed due to various reasons and now the Capital Development Authority (CDA) is hoping that the project will be completed in April (next year) instead of December.
Last year, the CDA awarded the project against Rs658 million and according to the PC-I, it is supposed to be completed by end of December. However, sources said that now the project would be completed somewhere in April.
They said the wing concerned of the authority had sought four months extension in completion of the project.
CDA officials said both P.W.D. Underpass and Korang Bridge project were awarded simultaneously and the same company won both contracts.
They said CDA’s first priority was to complete P.W.D. underpass, which was completed recently and now the second project would be finalised, adding that shifting of utility services also took extra time.
The expressway is one of the busiest roads of the city which caters to both local and heavy traffic particularly travelling to and from Lahore. The road is an important link between Punjab, Azad Kashmir, the northern areas and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
During the last two decades, a large number of housing societies were developed on both sides of the expressway and this resulted in an increase in traffic load. Every day, thousands of people use this road to drop their children to schools in the main city or go to their workplaces.
CDA officials said after expansion of the Korang Bridge, traffic congestion on the expressway would be resolved to some extent.
“We have already constructed several interchanges at Dhoke Kala Khan, Khanna Pul area and Koral; recently we completed work on P.W.D. project so after completion of Korang Bridge, the traffic congestion issue on expressway will be resolved to a significant extent,” said an engineer of CDA.
Meanwhile, he added, CDA will also repair and expand the existing service road from Faizabad to Koral and after this, traffic load on the expressway will further reduce.
