0,Samsung starts producing mobile phones in Pakistan,The company aims to manufacture around 3 million handsets every year.,"KARACHI: One of the world’s largest manufacturers of mobile phones, Samsung, has finally started production in Pakistan, lifting hopes of the authorities and the industry that this would cut down the import bill of the country in the months to come.  
The development came to light on Tuesday at a meeting of the company’s top managers with the Senators who visited the production site in line with the plan to receive a briefing on the growing new sector and challenges ahead for the cellphones manufacturing industry in Pakistan.  
“We were informed that Samsung has formally started its production,” Faisal Subzwari, chairman of the Senate’s Standing Committee on Industries and Production, told Dawn.  
He headed a delegation of members of the Senate panel which visited Samsung’s production unit and an auto manufacturing plant, and held a meeting with the management of Export Processing Zone.  

The company aims to manufacture around 3m handsets every year 

“It’s really good to know that the company has started production within a short span of four months,” Mr Subzwari said. “We visited the production facility which was designed on modern lines and obviously the local manpower, support of local industry and conducive environment provided by the government led to such achievement. But still I believe that we need to move forward from just growing in the assembling area to localisation of the industry.” 
The country has witnessed robust growth in local production of cellular phones. During the first 10 months of this year, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) data says, the production of mobile phones by local manufacturing plants has almost doubled to 18.87 million against the import of mobile phones which stood at 45m.  
However, despite the increase in local production of mobile phones, the import remained on a higher side. The PTA data says that mobile phones worth $644.673m were imported during the first four months (July-October) of 2021 compared to $557.961m during the same period of last year, registering a growth of 15.54 per cent. 
The industry believes that it may take time to achieve the desired results but with the fresh start in an absolutely new industrial avenue, things have finally started moving in the right direction. 
“With production of around 250,000 to 300,000, we aim to produce around 3m cellphones every year,” Mohammad Ali Tabba, chief of the Lucky Group which partners with Samsung to produce cellphones in Pakistan, told Dawn. “The whole production line is manual with no robotic assistance. So you can imagine how much workforce is required offering employment in this absolutely new area of engineering in Pakistan.” 
He agreed that the country needed to move towards localisation from its current status of assembling industry and believed it was more the role of the industrial sector than the government to go for modification and compatibility. 
“It’s not only the local production of cellphones but also a host of opportunities which it brings. From employment to investment and from export opportunities to local capacity building, it carries immense potential,” said Mr Tabba.

1,Barbados ditches Queen Elizabeth to become republic,"The birth of the republic, 55 years to the day since Barbados declared independence, unclasps almost all colonial bonds.","BRIDGETOWN: Barbados ditched Britain’s Queen Elizabeth as head of state, forging a new republic on Tuesday with its first-ever president and severing its last remaining colonial bonds nearly 400 years after the first English ships arrived at the Caribbean island. 
At the stroke of midnight, the new republic was born to cheers of people lining Chamberlain Bridge in the capital, Bridgetown. A 21-gun salute was fired as the national anthem of Barbados was played over a crowded Heroes Square. 
Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, stood as Queen Elizabeth’s royal standard was lowered and the new Barbados declared, a step which republicans hope will spur discussion of similar proposals in other former British colonies that have the Queen as their sovereign. 
“We the people must give Republic Barbados its spirit and its substance,” Sandra Mason, the island’s first president, said.  
“We must shape its future. We are each other’s and our nation’s keepers. We the people are Barbados.” 
Barbados casts the remo­val of Elizabeth II, who is still queen of 15 other realms including the United King­dom, Australia, Canada and Jamaica, as a way to finally break with the demons of its colonial history. 
“The creation of this republic offers a new beginning,” said Prince Charles. “From the darkest days of our past and the appalling atrocity of slavery which forever stains our history, people of this island forged their path with extraordinary fortitude.” 
In a message to the new president, the 95-year-old queen sent her congratulations to Barbadians who she said have held a special place in her heart.
“I send you and all Barbadians my warmest good wishes for your happiness, peace and prosperity in the future,” she said.
After a dazzling display of Barbadian dance and music, complete with speeches celebrating the end of colonialism, Barbadian singer Rihanna was declared a national hero by Prime Minister Mia Mottley, the leader of Barbados’ republican movement.
The birth of the republic, 55 years to the day since Barbados declared independence, unclasps almost all the colonial bonds that have kept the tiny island tied to England since an English ship claimed it for King James I in 1625.

2,No change in petrol prices as tax rates raised,"LPG price fixed at Rs2,390 per 11.8kg cylinder for December.","ISLAMABAD: Despite decline in international prices, the government on Tuesday decided to keep the prices of all major petroleum products unchanged for the next 15 days by increasing tax rates — both petroleum levy and general sales tax. 
The decision to increase the rates of petroleum levy and GST was taken in line with commitments given to the International Monetary Fund, otherwise the prices should have gone down by Rs8-9 per litre in line with decline in international prices. 
A part of this reduction was consumed by exchange rate loss while the government absorbed about Rs6 per litre reduction through combined increase in petroleum levy and GST rates. A straight increase of Rs4 per litre on petrol and high speed diesel (HSD) was affected through increase in petroleum levy of about Rs2 per liter and through GST. 

LPG price fixed at Rs2,390 per 11.8kg cylinder for December 

As such, petroleum levy on petrol was fixed at Rs13.62 per liter for next fortnight instead of Rs9.62 at present. GST on petrol was also increased from 1.43pc to 1.63pc of the end-product price. 
Likewise, petroleum levy on HSD was fixed at Rs13.14 per litre instead of Rs9.14 per litre. GST on HSD was also increased to 7.37pc instead of 6.75pc of end-product price. 
GST on kerosene was also increased to 8.20 per cent from 6.7pc at present. GST on light diesel oil was also jacked up to 0.46pc instead of 0.20pc at present. Petroleum levy on kerosene and LDO was also increased by Rs4 per litre to Rs5.91 and Rs3.66 per liter, respectively. 
Therefore, under the notification, the ex-depot price of petrol was kept unchanged at Rs145.82 per litre. The ex-depot price of HSD was also maintained at the existing level Rs142.62 per liter. The ex-depot prices of kerosene and light diesel oil were also kept unchanged at Rs116.53 per litre and Rs114.07 per litre, respectively.  
Meanwhile, Ogra notified the sale price of liquefied petroleum gas at Rs2,390 per 11.8kg cylinder for December, showing a decline of about 6.6pc when compared with last month but about 54pc higher than comparable month of December last year when the prices stood at Rs1,553 per cylinder.

3,Balochistan seeks role in decisions about Reko Diq,Assembly adopts resolution demanding in-camera briefing on alleged deal in Islamabad.,"QUETTA: The Balochistan Assembly on Tuesday evening passed a resolution demanding an in-camera briefing on any plans of the federal government to sign a deal on copper and gold mining at Reko Diq.
The resolution was passed without any opposition after the house was apprised that the federal government was going to sign an agreement or an MoU regarding copper and gold mining without taking the Balochistan government and assembly into confidence. The resolution was tabled by opposition member Mir Akhtar Hussain Langove of the Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M). 
After seeking permission of Acting Speaker Sardar Babar Khan Musakhail, who was presiding over the session, to move the resolution, Mr Langove said there were reports that the federal government was taking “illegal steps” to deprive the people of Balochistan of their natural resources and that in near future an agreement or a memorandum of understanding would be inked in Islamabad.

The lawmaker asserted that the people of Balochistan were the real owners of Reko Diq and other natural resources in the province but they had not been allowed to take part in the decision-making process, particularly regarding natural resources. He said the Balochistan government and elected representatives of the people of the province were in the dark about any such decision.
Referring to the 18th Amendment, the opposition lawmaker demanded the role of Balochistan in any such decision and suggested that an assembly committee be established for negotiation with the federal government in this regard.
Opposition leader Malik Sikander Khan, Mohammad Asghar Khan Achakzai, Asghar Ali Tareen, Malik Naseer Ahmed Shahwani, Ahmed Nawaz Baloch and Nasarullah Zerey also spoke.

4,Opposition assails govt move to link ECP funds to EVM use in polls,Vows to raise the issue of alleged corruption in Covid fund in parliament.,"ISLAMABAD: The opposition parties lashed out at the government on Tuesday for allegedly threatening and putting pressure on the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for the use of electronic voting machines (EVMs) in the next general elections and over a recent audit report that pointed out massive irregularities in Covid-19 spending.  
In a statement, PPP Senator Saleem Mandviwalla said the federal cabinet’s decision to block funds to the ECP was a “direct threat” and interference in the powers of the commission, which was an independent organisation according to the Constitution.  
Mr Mandviwalla issued the statement hours after federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Fawad Chaudhry hinted that the government was unlikely to fund elections held without the use of EVMs.  

Vows to raise the issue of alleged corruption in Covid fund in parliament 

Speaking after a federal cabinet meeting in Islamabad on Tuesday, Mr Chaudhry said the cabinet had agreed that the ECP was bound to use EVMs in by-elections to be held in the country after the passage of the law in this regard by the parliament. He said one point of view was that the government could not provide funds for any election held without EVMs.  
“This decision of the federal cabinet is ridiculous and condemnable,” said Mr Mandviwalla while recalling that the opposition parties as well as the ECP had already expressed their reservations over the use of EVMs in the elections.  
The PPP senator said that under the Constitution, the ECP was responsible for conducting elections in an independent and transparent manner, and the federal government could not impose its “favourite decisions” on the commission.  
PPP would stand by the ECP on the issue and would not allow anyone to put curbs on it, he said and asked the government to immediately withdraw the decision.  
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, while speaking at a public meeting in Peshawar, once again stated that the law regarding the use of EVMs would be challenged “on the streets and in courts”.  
Meanwhile, PML-N Senator Irfan Siddiqui said the opposition would raise the issue of a “financial scandal amounting to Rs40 billion in coronavirus funds” in the parliament.  
“This is just one example from three years of serious corruption in various fields. The claimants of transparency and the state of Madina should immediately pay back Rs40bn to the national exchequer,” he said.  
Mr Siddiqui was commenting on the audit report on Covid-19 expenditures released by the finance ministry, which has pointed out irregularities of up to Rs5.24bn in purchases of sugar, ghee and wheat flour by the Utility Stores Corporation, including procurement of unfit for consumption ghee and edible oil worth Rs1.4bn.  
The report on “expenditures incurred on Covid-19 by the federal government” pointed out irregularities in government interventions to ensure the availability of five essential items — sugar, wheat flour, oil and ghee, pulses and rice — in utility stores at subsidised rates during the pandemic.  
“This is a huge corruption scandal,” Mr Siddiqui said. “This shameful story of corruption has been kept hidden from the public eye for the last six months.” 
He alleged that the government was systematically lying and misleading the people. Now the government was compelled to release the report because the International Monetary Fund had set this as a precondition for new loan disbursement, he said. 
The PML-N senator said it was claimed that Rs100bn was being given to utility stores in order to provide relief to the people. In practice, only Rs10bn was allocated, “more than half of which amounting to over Rs5bn was embezzled in corruption”, he alleged. 
Besides, it was propagated by the government that Rs200bn was provided to labourers and daily wagers, but in practice only Rs16bn was distributed, he said. 
“No one knows the actual level of embezzlement done under the garb of providing relief to common people,” the PML-N senator said, adding that such corruption had severely damaged the country’s reputation internationally.
