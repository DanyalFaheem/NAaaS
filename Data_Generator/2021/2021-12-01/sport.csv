0,Klusener to step down as Afghanistan head coach,"The ACB said it had mutually decided with Klusener not to extend his contract, which is due to expire on Dec 31.","KABUL: Afghanistan head coach Lance Klusener will leave at the end of his contract next month by mutual agreement, the country’s cricket board (ACB) announced on Tuesday.
The former South Africa all-rounder was appointed in September 2019 and led Afghanistan at this year’s Twenty20 World Cup, where they won two of five matches in the group stages.
The ACB said that it had mutually decided with Klusener not to extend his contract, which is due to expire on Dec 31.
“The Afghanistan Cricket Board and the national cricket team have had the coaching services of Mr. Lance Klusener for more than two years; shared and will take away some exciting memories from his tenure,” the ACB said in a statement.
Under Klusener, Afghanistan won one of their three Tests, three out of six ODIs and nine out of 14 T20 Internationals.

1,Pak vs Ban: Fit-again Shakib returns for second Test against Green Shirts,"Bangladesh has also included pace bowler Taskin Ahmed, who missed the first Test due to a finger injury.","DHAKA: Shakib Al Hasan is fit and will return to the Bangladesh squad for the second Test against Pakistan in Dhaka next week, his side said on Tuesday.
A hamstring injury against the West Indies last month prematurely ended Shakib’s time at the T20 World Cup, and he missed November’s three-match short format series against Pakistan.
He was included in the squad for the first Test, which ended with a thumping eight-wicket victory for Pakistan on Tuesday, but was subsequently ruled out.
Without key spinner Shakib, Taijul Islam staged a lone and losing battle for Bangladesh despite his 7-116 to help the hosts to a first innings lead of 44.
Bangladesh also included pace bowler Taskin Ahmed, who missed the first Test due to a finger injury. Batsman Mohammad Naim, who has played 32 T20Is and two ODIs, received his maiden Test call-up.
The second Test will be played at Dhaka’s Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium from Dec 4-8.

2,Perth in serious doubt for Ashes finale,SYDNEY: Perth’s hopes of hosting the fifth Ashes Test were in serious doubt on Tuesday after Western Australia’s...,"SYDNEY: Perth’s hopes of hosting the fifth Ashes Test were in serious doubt on Tuesday after Western Australia’s premier said players and broadcasters must quarantine for 14 days on entering the state.
Cricket officials had been confident the potentially pivotal clash between Australia and England would go ahead in the city after suggestions that some of its tough Covid restrictions would be relaxed or exemptions granted.
But the emergence of the new Omicron coronavirus variant has complicated matters and Premier Mark McGowan indicated the state’s hardline quarantine rules would remain.
Canberra and Hobart have both expressed interest in hosting the match should Perth be axed, although a second Test in either Sydney or Melbourne are also options.
“The thing about the Ashes and Cricket Australia is we have put in place very strict rules,” McGowan told reporters.
“We’ve said to them they need to have 14 days of quarantine and that has to apply to all of the broadcast staff, all the cricket staff.” The Perth Test is scheduled to start on January 14, five days after the fourth Test in Sydney, meaning a two-week quarantine period would not be possible.
McGowan stressed that players’ families would not be allowed in no matter what.
“They can’t just bring wives and girlfriends with them — the same rules as we put in place for the AFL (Australian Rules). It is up to them whether they want to adhere to those rules or not.”
Australian media said the Melbourne Cricket Ground was the frontrunner to replace Perth, possibly under lights as a day-night match with the pink ball.
The Ashes starts next week in Brisbane before moving to Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney ahead of Perth.

3,NZ coach slams FIFA over Oceania World Cup qualifying tournament,ZURICH: New Zealand coach Danny Hay has criticised FIFA for scheduling part of Oceania’s World Cup qualifying...,"ZURICH: New Zealand coach Danny Hay has criticised FIFA for scheduling part of Oceania’s World Cup qualifying tournament outside the international window, saying it would not happen to any other region. 
The nine-team tournament will be staged in Qatar from March 14-30 to decide which team advances to a playoff against the fourth-placed side from CONCACAF, which features nations from North and Central America, and the Caribbean. 
World governing body FIFA have given the Oceania nations a one-day extension to the March 21-29 international window but they will have to haggle with clubs to release players during the first week of the event. 
New Zealand is disproportionately impacted by the scheduling given it has more players at professional clubs than their Pacific rivals. 
“This would happen nowhere else in the world,” Hay told New Zealand media. “I’m here in Denmark at the moment and trying to explain how this has transpired, nobody can get their head around it. 
“I spoke with the Danish Football Federation today, and they were just bamboozled. Imagine saying to the Danish national team that you’ve got World Cup qualifying, but you can’t pick your best players? 
“For me and our players, it’s highly disappointing.” 
New Zealand were the last Oceania team to qualify for the World Cup when they made the 2010 finals in South Africa. 
They have been drawn in Group ‘B’ of the Oceania event against New Caledonia, Fiji and Papua New Guinea. 
“Every single player that I’ve called up to date is a professional player, they’re operating in professional environments, but clubs aren’t going to be willing to hand over their players in the middle of the season,” said Hay. 
“It’s tough to swallow, that we are not going to have the opportunity to bring our best players together to give us the best opportunity to qualify.” 
New Zealand have played little competitive soccer in the past four years. After the 2017 Confederations Cup in Russia — losing to the hosts, Mexico and Portugal — New Zealand missed out on the 2018 World Cup by losing to Peru over two legs in the intercontinental playoffs. 
Now ranked No. 110 by FIFA, the Kiwis have played just a few friendlies in the past three years and not at all in 2020. 
Group ‘A’ has Solomon Islands, Tahiti and Vanuatu, plus the winner of a play-in preliminary game between Tonga and Cook Islands. 
The top two in each group advance to the semi-finals, with a March 30 final to decide Oceania’s entry in the intercontinental playoffs.

4,‘England can do something special despite disrupted build-up’,"BRISBANE: Joe Root is confident that England can do  “something special” in the Ashes, despite rain again ...","BRISBANE: Joe Root is confident that England can do  “something special” in the Ashes, despite rain again ruining their preparations on Tuesday, and said they won’t be distracted by upheaval in the Australian camp.
The tourists’ build-up to the five-Test series, which starts next week at Brisbane’s Gabba ground, has been wrecked by bad weather.
A three-day practice match was washed out last week, bar 29 overs, and the opening day of their final four-day hit-out on Tuesday was also rained off, with more showers forecast.
“It’s been unusual, it’s been different to a lot of previous tours,” skipper Root said.
“The guys have really taken the opportunity to get as much as they can from what they’ve had and that’s all you can really do in these situations, along with mentally making sure you are as ready as you can be.”
Openers Rory Burns and Haseeb Hameed, along with spinner Dom Bess, are the only members of the Ashes party to have any match practice since the tour started.
Players who featured at the recent T20 World Cup -- including Jos Buttler, Mark Wood, Jonny Bairstow, Dawid Malan and Chris Woakes — only linked up with the squad on Tuesday after 14 days of quarantine and had hoped to see some red-ball action.
Despite the setbacks and England losing nine out of their past 10 Tests in Australia, Root said his side have a chance to excel this time.
“If we can control our emotions, play to our skill level and if we can be smart in situations and do things differently to how we’ve done them previously, then I believe we’ve got a brilliant chance to do something special here,” he said.
Australia similarly head into the first Test on Dec 8 lacking match practice, with their only red-ball warm-up a three-day clash due to start on Wednesday — that also faces being washed out.
They have also been rocked by the shock resignation of Tim Paine as captain, with Pat Cummins taking over.
“From our point of view it doesn’t change anything, it doesn’t change how we prepare, that we respect them as a team and what they will bring to this series,” Root said of the Australian upheaval.
“More than anything, I don’t want us as a team to get sidetracked by what’s happening in their camp. It’s really important that we focus on ourselves and ready ourselves as best we can.
“Playing against Pat, I know what a competitor he is and what he brings to their team. I expect him to do just that as a captain as well,” the England captain added.

5,Messi claims record-extending seventh Ballon d’Or,Putellas crowned women’s winner,"PARIS: Lionel Messi won the men’s Ballon d’Or for a record-stretching seventh time on Monday, ending the year in style after a brilliant final season with Barcelona and earning his first major international trophy with Argentina. 
The forward added to his 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015 and 2019 trophies after winning the Copa America for the first time with his country last July. 
Now 34, Messi pipped much-fancied rivals like Robert Lewandowski and Karim Benzema to take the award in a glittering ceremony in Paris, the city he now calls home after leaving boyhood club Barca for Paris St Germain in August. 
Despite his tearful goodbye from Barcelona and his relatively underwhelming start to life in France, the jury of journalists from around the world rewarded him in particular for captaining Argentina to their first major international title since 1993. 

Putellas crowned women’s winner

“It’s incredible to be here again. Two years ago I thought it was the last time. Winning the Copa America was key,” Messi said at Paris’s Theatre du Chatelet, where he was joined by his wife Antonella Roccuzzo and their three children. 
“It is a special year for me with this Copa America title. It meant a lot to win at the Maracana stadium and I was so happy to celebrate with the people from Argentina. 
“I don’t know if it’s the best year of my life, I’ve had a long career, but it was a special one with the title with Argentina after the tough times and the criticism. 
“I’m very happy to be here, happy to keep fighting for new trophies. I don’t know how many years I have left, but I hope many more. I’d like to thank all my [former] team-mates at Barcelona and Argentina. 
“People were starting to ask me when I was going to retire but now I am here in Paris and I am very happy.” 
Argentina beat Brazil 1-0 in the final in Rio de Janeiro as Messi won a major title with his country for the first time. He also scored 38 goals in 48 games in his final season with Barcelona and won the Copa del Rey. 
However Messi has played just 11 times and scored four goals for PSG since joining the French club and there was a feeling that this year might see a different winner.
Poland striker Lewandowski would have been a shoe-in in 2020, when he scored 45 goals in 37 games for Bayern, only for the awards to be cancelled. 
He ended last season with a remarkable 41 Bundesliga goals but had to settle for second place in the voting for the Ballon d’Or, which is organised by France Football magazine and voted for by a panel of journalists from around the world.
Lewandowski instead was given a consolation prize for the year’s best goal-scorer and received glowing praise from Messi. 
“I wanted to say to Robert that it was an honour to go up against him. He deserved to win it last year,” Messi said.
Midfielder Jorginho, who won the Champions League with Chelsea and the European championship with Italy, ended up third on 460, ahead of France’s Karim Benzema and Ngolo Kante in fourth and fifth places respectively. 
Five-time winner Cristiano Ronaldo came sixth. He was absent from the ceremony. 
Between them, Messi and Ronaldo have won 12 of the last 13 editions of the Ballon d’Or with the exception coming in 2018 when Luka Modric claimed the prize.
Chelsea, named club of the year, also had keeper Edouard Mendy finishing second in the Yashin trophy behind Italy’s Gianluigi Donnarumma. 
The women’s Ballon d’Or went to Alexia Putellas after the Spain midfielder guided Barcelona to Champions League glory. 
Putellas tallied 186 points to finish far ahead of club and country team-mate Jenni Hermoso on 84. 
Putellas is the third winner of the Ballon dOr Feminin after Ada Hegerberg in 2018 and Megan Rapinoe in 2019.  
On a good night for Barcelona, the 19-year-old Pedri was awarded the Kopa trophy for the best Under-21 player. He caught the eye at Euro 2020 and reached the Olympic final. 
“The best way to celebrate turning 19 is receiving this award. I’d like to thank everyone at Barcelona for helping me here,” he said. 
The Lev Yashin trophy for best goalkeeper was won by Gianluigi Donnarumma, who helped Italy win the Euros.

It is the latest instance of the Southeast Asian nation, which has no diplomatic relations with Israel, barring the country’s athletes.
The World Team Championship for men had been due to take place in Kuala Lumpur from Dec 7-12 with 26 squads participating.
But the World Squash Federation (WSF) and Malaysia’s squash body said that it had been axed because of the  “possibility that some nations would be unable to compete due to the lack of confirmation over the issuing of visas”.
WSF president Zena Wooldridge said sports officials had sought to  “influence the highest authorities of Malaysia to ensure the ability of all participating teams, including Israel, to enter Malaysia and compete.
“It is important to WSF that no nation who wishes to compete misses out on the event.”
Israel’s squash association previously said that countries which participated in a tournament from which Israel was barred would be closing their eyes to  “racism and discrimination”.
The association also threatened to turn to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland if the WSF could not resolve the issue.
The WSF said the decision to cancel the event was also influenced by the new Omicron coronavirus variant, which it fears could affect travel to Malaysia.
The tournament was earlier this year moved to Malaysia from New Zealand because of coronavirus-related travel restrictions.
In 2019, Malaysia was stripped of the right to host the World Para Swimming Championships for threatening to refuse Israeli athletes.
And in 2015, Israeli windsurfers had to pull out of a competition on the island of Langkawi after being refused visas.

TURIN: Croatia dumped out much-fancied Italy in the Davis Cup quarter-finals on Monday as Olympic men’s doubles champions Nikola Mektic and Mate Pavic brushed aside Jannik Sinner and Fabio Fognini in a deciding match.
The Italians were one of the favourites for the title but paid for Lorenzo Sonego’s shock defeat by world number 279 Borna Gojo in the first singles rubber in Turin.
Singles world number 10 Sinner forced a deciding doubles with a dramatic victory over Marin Cilic, but he could not complete the job against the top two ranked doubles players as Mektic and Pavic won 6-3, 6-4 to silence the home crowd. 
Croatia will next face either Novak Djokovic’s Serbia or Kazakhstan in the semi-finals in Madrid. 
“Honestly, it feels incredible. I don’t think anyone expected us to get this far and it feels amazing to be going to Madrid,” said Mektic. 
Croatia are bidding for a third Davis Cup title and second in three stagings of the event after lifting the trophy in 2018.
Last year’s edition was postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
This win confirms their place at next year’s Davis Cup Finals, with the four semi-finalists guaranteed qualification. 
“It was very tight but my players fought so well. I’m so happy,” said Croatian captain Vedran Martic. 
Mektic and Pavic were the stronger pair throughout the doubles, with Fognini’s serve often targeted. 
They needed six set points to take the opener despite dominating, but wrapped up victory on their first match point in the second set as Pavic fired down an ace. 
Earlier, rising star Sinner battled back from a set and a break down to beat Cilic and force the doubles rubber. 
Italy were facing a quick exit in Turin when former US Open champion Cilic served for the match when leading 5-4 in the second set. 
But Sinner fought back from the brink, breaking to love before taking a tie-break and going on to win 3-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3. 
Gojo beat Sonego 7-6 (7-2), 2-6, 6-2 to give Croatia the first point. 
The Croatian overcame a hesitant start, with the 23-year-old trailing the 27th-ranked Sonego 4-1 in northern Italy, before coming back from 5-3 down to take the first set in a tie-break. 
Sonego, 26, powered back in the second set but dropped serve early in the final set at 2-1, with over 30 unforced errors allowing Gojo to win in 2 hours and 20 minutes. 
“I knew third set it was either ones game one set, anything can happen,” Gojo said. It was a really tough game at 4-2 and I managed to hold. So, yeah, I’m really happy.”

Abid and Abdullah Shafique put on a 151-run partnership for the first wicket, their second consecutive 100-plus stand in the match to give Pakistan’s chase a powerful start and help bring play to an end before lunch on the final day. 
The duo had already made 109 overnight. 
Bangladesh had to wait until the 10th over of the day for their first success when Mehidy Hasan trapped debutant Abdullah lbw on 73 with a fuller delivery. 
Abdullah, who also scored a fifty in the first innings, fell after hitting eight fours and a six. 
Ali, who made 133 in Pakistan’s first innings, looked poised to become first Pakistani to a make a Test century pair in six years, after Misbah-ul-Haq achieved the feat against Australia in 2014. 
But Taijul Islam hit him in front of the middle stump with a straighter delivery, with Pakistan just 31 runs from victory. 
“Abdullah Shafique was making his debut, so we tried to stay on the crease, waited for bad balls and succeeded in putting those away,” said man-of-the-match Abid. 
“I had done well in domestic cricket and carried that positive mindset here too. Abdullah played really well, I gave him more credit. I am a bit disappointed that I got out for 91 in the second innings but at the same time I am happy that we won the match.” 
He left the crease to a standing ovation and was also congratulated by Bangladeshi fielders on a splendid 148-ball innings that saw 12 boundaries. 
Azhar Ali, 24 not out, finished the game at over 58.3 after back-to-back boundaries off Mehidy, with skipper Babar Azam unbeaten on 13 at the other end. 
“I’m really pleased with the way Abdullah Shafique built his innings and Abid Ali was outstanding, scoring tough runs to pull the team out from difficult position,” Babar said, also crediting his bowlers for turning the match after his team conceded a first-innings lead. 
“The way Bangladesh played in the first innings was really good but Shaheen [Shah Afridi] and Hasan [Ali] were outstanding. 
“That’s the beauty of Test cricket that it allows you to make a comeback. We didn’t have much time to prepare for the Test but we gave our best.” 
Taijul finished the game with eight wickets for the hosts, which included 7-116 in the first innings. 
The hosts scored 330 runs in the first innings and took a 44-run lead after bowling out Pakistan. 
Bangladesh wicketkeeper-batsman Liton Das made 114 runs in the first innings and top-scored in the next with 59. 
Hasan and Shaheen shone with the ball for Pakistan, claiming 5-51 and 5-32 respectively in two innings. 
“The key difference was the performance of the top order of the both teams in this Test,” Bangladesh captain Mominul Haque said. “We were four down for 40-odd runs in both innings when their openers have two 100-plus partnerships. 
“We lost in the first hour in the first innings and second innings as well, but credit to them, especially Shaheen and Hasan. They bowled really well. Mushfiqur [Rahim], Liton stepped up, Taijul got seven wickets but as a team we couldn’t play well.” 
The second Test will be played at Dhaka’s Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium from December 4-8.

Rain interrupted play half an hour before tea and it did not resume, in a match that has been plagued by inclement weather and bad light, with the tourists trailing by 135.
Permaul’s first long-format match in six years helped bowl out Sri Lanka for 204 on the second day with a career-best 5-35.
“Over the years I’ve been working hard to get back into the team and glad it all worked today,” he said.
The West Indies’ decision to play two left-arm spin specialists proved a masterstroke against a side heavy with right-handed batters.
Permaul and fellow left-arm spinner Jomel Warrican, who claimed 4-50, cut through the Sri Lankan order on a wicket with plenty of turn and bounce.
“Great to bowl in tandem with Jomel. He kept things tight, putting pressure. We are pretty happy with the status quo,” Permaul said.
It was the fourth time in history that West Indies spinners claimed all 10 wickets in an innings. Off-spinner Roston Chase had claimed captain Dimuth Karunaratne on day one with Sri Lanka resuming overnight on 113.
“Great pitch for spinners and there is bounce as well, which makes them even more dangerous,” said Sri Lanka batting coach Grant Flower.
Sri Lanka bank heavily on skipper Karunaratne and when he doesn’t deliver, the team struggles against spin.
“Obviously Dimuth is our key player. If he doesn’t get a big hundred, the others need to put their hands up and cash in,” Flower said.
“Not a good effort by the others but I am sure they will come good in the second innings.”
Openers Kraigg Brathwaite and Jermaine Blackwood stood more resolute against Sri Lanka’s spin attack, which had demolished the tourists’ top order in their 187-run first Test loss.
Blackwood left on 44 when Praveen Jayawickrama trapped him leg before, ending a stand of 62.
Overnight batsman Pathum Nissanka had offered a couple of half chances in the morning, but his luck ran out when Permaul trapped him leg before wicket for 73 off 148 deliveries.
Permaul had a second wicket in the same over when Dhananjaya de Silva was caught behind by wicketkeeper Joshua da Silva.
Things went from bad to worse for Sri Lanka when Angelo Mathews, their most experienced batter, briefly retired with a pulled hamstring.
He returned after just under eight overs and managed to lift the team over 200, despite struggling to run between wickets, with consecutive sixes off Warrican.
He was last man dismissed, for 29, and did not go out to field.
Sri Lanka lead the two-match series 1-0.
