0,Experts concerned over alarming rise of HIV/AIDS cases countrywide,"80pc HIV-infected people in Pakistan are not aware of their condition, according to experts.","KARACHI: In contrast to the remarkable progress the world has made against HIV/AIDS, Pakistan has been showing an alarming increase in infection and reported 25,000 new HIV cases last year.
The key reason for HIV spread, particularly in the general population, is the lack of infection control practices at healthcare facilities and lack of awareness in society.  
These concerns were raised by experts at an event held to mark World AIDS Day on Tuesday at a local hotel.  
The programme — a consultative meeting with long term survivors of HIV and launch of a risk communication and community engagement plan on safe injection practices — was organised by Bridge Consultants Foundation (BCF), a non-profit organisation currently working with the community in Ratodero, Larkana, with Unicef’s support.  

80pc HIV-infected people in Pakistan are not aware of their condition

Explaining why it’s important to have infection control practices, experts said no government could eliminate a communicable disease or contain its risk, including Covid-19, without enforcing a strong mechanism of infection prevention and control.  
Infection prevention and control in healthcare settings, they said, also included safe injection practices, use of personal protection equipment in patient care, cleaning and disinfection of rooms as well as proper collection and disposal of medical waste.  
“But, there is no concept of infection control practices even at public sector tertiary care hospitals in our country. We have seen hospital washrooms either without water or soap while it’s common to see used syringes being thrown away in dustbins instead of separate boxes,” said Dr Sharaf Ali Shah.  
Infectious medical waste was a serious threat to public health, he added.  
The major reason for HIV spread/outbreaks reported in the towns of Gujrat, Sargodha in Punjab and Larkana, Sindh, in recent years, experts pointed out, was the unsafe use of injection.  
“Unsafe injection practices contribute significantly to the burden of blood borne viral infections. The estimated number of infections per person per year amongst a sample of 13 low-income countries, range between 1.2 (in Tanzania and India) and 8.5 (in Pakistan) with a median 1.5,” said Waheed Khattak of BCF.  
Sustainable HIV programme 
Earlier, speakers informed the audience that the world had seen 52 per cent decline in new HIV cases since 1997. In 2020, there were 1.5m new HIV cases whereas 1997 had seen three million new cases.  
“This progress was mainly due to effective antiretroviral drugs and enhanced HIV testing. In Pakistan, however, cases are on the rise in vulnerable groups (sex workers, transgender people and injecting drug users) as well as in the general population,” noted Dr Rafiq Khanani, President of the Infection Control Society of Pakistan.  
The registered number of HIV positive persons in Pakistan, experts said was about 200,000, half of whom belonged to vulnerable groups. An estimated 4,900 children aged 1-14 were living with HIV. 
“The actual number of HIV cases, however, is much higher. Studies have shown that 80pc of HIV infected persons in the country are not aware of their disease status and not on treatment, increasing vulnerability of other people in society,” said Dr Sharaf Ali Shah, adding that 25,000 new HIV cases were reported in 2020 in Pakistan.  
Sharing challenges, he said the government must resume the services earlier being provided to people living with HIV, enhance testing and own the HIV programme. Currently, all medicines of the programme were being donated by the Global Fund.

1,"‘Male elephant’ at Karachi's Safari Park turns out to be female after 12 years, SHC told",Team of vets says physical condition of four elephants at Karachi Zoo and Safari Park is good.,"KARACHI: A six-member team of veterinary experts on Tuesday informed the Sindh High Court (SHC) that the overall physical condition of the four African elephants at Karachi Zoo and Safari Park was good, but some immediate and long-term measures were needed to address their dietary, dental and other issues.
The team, headed by German vet Dr Frank Goritz, in its interim report placed before the SHC made a startling disclosure that one of the four elephants earlier considered as a male turned out to be a female in check-up. 
The report said that as per preliminary results, both elephants kept at Safari Park had severe food problems and elephants at Zoo had severe dental problems.
Dr Goritz requested a two-judge bench headed by Justice Zafar Ahmed Rajput two-week time as results of some tests were still pending. He said he would clearly communicate the detailed results of the assessment and provide a report with specific recommendations.
The interim report stated that the team carried out visual inspection of body condition, blood collection for analysis, behaviour/temper, foot and dental status, standing sedation, body measurements for scientifically based calculation of body condition scoring index and other procedures.

“The overall physical condition of elephants is good, but slightly overweight and developed mild subcutaneous edema [accumulation of body water in the tissue]. However, both animals at [Karachi] Zoo showed low haemoglobin concentration and decreased haematocrit/PCV 3,” the report stated.
It also stated that one elephant, Sonu, at the Safari Park presented as a male turned out to be proven female as uterus and inactive ovaries were visualised ultrasonographically, but an oversized clitoris has been palpated inside the vestibulum, which was getting exposed very often by Sonu as reported by local staff.
It may be noted that elephants Sonu and Malaka were brought from Tanzania in 2009.
The team suggested some immediate actions including implementation of medical training into daily routine to provide proper foot care to two elephants, surgical removal of damaged and infected tusks with subsequent topic and general anti-infectious and anti-inflammatory treatment, vaccination against tetanus and other clostridium bacteria foot.
It added that dental problems/diseases were very painful and could lead to life-threatening situations in elephants.
As a long-term measure, it also recommended to provide species-specific keeping conditions necessary for housing a group of adult female elephants safely and ensure a good health status on a long-term basis to improve the animal well-being.
“Although the actual physical condition of elephants is good and their health status is not alarming, they display signs of neglected body/food care programme and some stereotypic behaviour, but it is imperative to train the animal to receive routine body care and basic medical check-ups (food trimming, blood collection) as well as to provide simple veterinary care (injections, treatment of creaked nails, wound treatments) to prevent disease manifestation and decline of general health conditions.”
The bench granted three-week time to the team for submitting the final report and adjourned the matter till Dec 22.
In September, the SHC had appointed Dr Goritz to verify the health condition of the four elephants after a non-governmental organisation for animals had petitioned the SHC seeking the shifting of the elephants to an appropriate habitat. The Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, however, claimed that elephants had no health issues and needed no medical assistance.

2,"New LG bill an attempt to alienate urban people, says Kamal","The state must stop the PPP, otherwise, those who have been pushed against the wall today may take up arms tomorrow: PSP chief","KARACHI: Describing the new local government bill as a ‘black law and a conspiracy’ of the Pakistan Peoples Party government, Pak Sarzameen Party chairman Syed Mustafa Kamal on Tuesday demanded that the state must stop the PPP from taking measures that might “alienate people of urban areas of the province from the state”.  
“The PPP is making tomorrow’s terrorists by taking such measures that have been alienating the people with the state. The state must stop the PPP, otherwise, those who have been pushed against the wall today may take up arms tomorrow. The PPP’s actions will only strengthen the anti-national elements,” he warned while speaking at a press conference here.  
He also raised serious concerns over an amendment through which the procedure to elect mayor was changed from ‘show of hands’ to ‘secret ballot’ saying it would pave the way to ‘horse-trading’. 
“In a country where senators change loyalties in the prevalent culture of horse-trading, the councillors will also be compelled to change their loyalties,” he said, adding that the PSP would take all possible steps against the current bill and the Sindh Local Government Act, 2013.  
Accompanied by party president Anis Kaim Khani and other leaders, he said that his party was contacting and holding meetings with other political parties on a single-point agenda against the new LG law.  
He said that the PPP-approved LG bill was in clear violation of the Constitution.  
The PSP chief said all powers and resources of local governments were already vested in the chief minister and now the provincial government had occupied remaining functions of the Karachi Metropolitan Corpo­r­a­tion and its departments.  
He said in all developed countries the education, healthcare, infrastructure and even airports and seaports fell under the administrative control of local governments and not in the federal or provincial governments. “It is not the federal or provincial government but the local government that connects the people to the state,” he said.

3,Alvi regrets using Governor House for son’s venture,KARACHI: Facing serious criticism mainly over social media for using the premises of Sindh Governor House for a...,"KARACHI: Facing serious criticism mainly over social media for using the premises of Sindh Governor House for a signing ceremony of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) of his son’s business venture a day before, President Arif Alvi on Tuesday admitted that it was ‘poor judgment’ on his part that led to such a situation. 
He expressed the regret on twitter, where only a few hours ago he had posted a congratulatory message to his son, Awab, for entering into a business expansion understanding with a US organisation. 
“For the signing ceremony of an MOU between @DrAwab and his friend in my presence, the venue selection was a matter of poor judgment,” he tweeted.
Only on Monday evening, President Alvi had not only extended good wishes and prayers to his dentist son, but also shared a photo of him signing a document with a representative of a US organisation. 
His admission about the “poor judgment” came after a number of people ranging from common citizens to media celebrities and politicians to social media activists, questioned whether there was a conflict of interest in the president attending a private event that was also hosted at the official residence of the Sindh governor. 
On Monday, the MoU for providing ‘affordable’ dental care to people in Pakistan across the country was signed between the president’s son Awab Alvi of the Alvi Dental Hospital and Dr Anas Athar of Bringing Smiles USA. 
A picture tweeted by his son and shared by President Alvi also showed First Lady Samina Arif Alvi among the guests at the event.

5,I Am And I Am Not under way,"KARACHI: Aisha Khalid’s illustrious career in art spans almost three decades, and it’s been a fantastic journey...","KARACHI: Aisha Khalid’s illustrious career in art spans almost three decades, and it’s been a fantastic journey in terms of her achievements. She is one of the country’s foremost artists who, with her enviable technical prowess and a fertile imagination, are in a league of their own, particularly with reference to miniature. Her range of subjects varies from the way she views society’s growth (or lack of it) to individuals’ lives that cannot be studied in isolation. 
The city’s renowned Chawkandi Art Gallery in collaboration with HBL has come up with a worthy idea of acknowledging Khalid’s accomplishments covering no fewer than 28 years by organising a retrospective exhibition of her work displayed simultaneously at three important cultural centres of the city — Frere Hall, AAN Gandhara Art Space and Chawkandi Art Gallery. 
The event began with a bit of fanfare at Frere Hall on Nov 27 with dignitaries from the world of art, politics and the banking sector addressing the audience that had turned up in a good number to see the artist’s remarkable body of work. 
The title of the show is I Am And I Am Not. It, on surface, appears to be an existentialist question… of being. That’s not entirely the case. The exhibits — paintings, installations, videos, etc — raise questions that go beyond the personal perspective resulting in brooding introspection. The artist touches upon matters that tackle both physical and spiritual domains in such a way that it imparts a collective meaning to the whole creative exercise. The prime example of it is a piece (gouache on digital print, paper board) in which she focuses on the iconic Taj Mahal. The caption accompanying the exhibit reads: “For Khalid, worldly love has imperfections and can never be considered complete. The only love that is complete is Ishq-i-Haqiqi or the love of God as there are no flaws in it and no conditions attached.” 
This is the gist of the retrospective: the self-effacing aspect of existence where the idea of being (of I am) is understood in the much larger scheme of things where the self is looked at through the prism of spirituality.    
The exhibition, curated by Masuma Halai Khwaja, will conclude on Jan 8, 2022.

9,Bid to stop tree felling at Gharo RHC thwarted,THATTA: A considerably large portion of the lush green lawn of the Gharo rural health centre (RHC) was on Tuesday...,"THATTA: A considerably large portion of the lush green lawn of the Gharo rural health centre (RHC) was on Tuesday turned into a treeless space with the consent of its medical superintendent Dr Nizam Khaskheli.
While supervising the chopping of dozens of full-grown trees, he exercised his powers to prevent a group picnickers, who happened to be there, from making any attempt to stop the tree-felling activity during their protest.
The picnickers had briefly stopped at the RHC after visiting the nearby Haleji Lake — locally called “birds’ paradise” — and tried to resist tree-felling arguing that the action was bound to snatch the RHC premises of its natural beauty, besides depriving patients, their attendants and other visitors of oxygen-generating sheltering trees abundantly present there. 
The MS, however, disregarded their displeasure over the activity and ordered labour to continue with the work. Truckloads of chopped-off trees were later transported to Karachi for sale. The protesters kept watching the whole activity helplessly, before leaving the place, after Mr Khaskheli warned them that he would not tolerate “obstruction in the discharge of my official duty”.
Local reporters along with cameramen rushed to the RHC after receiving information about the tree-felling activity but the MS did not speak to them on the matter.
In the evening, a large number of local residents approached Thatta Deputy Commissioner Ghazanfar Qadri and requested him to look into the matter. They said he must realise that the trees had been serving as a vital part of the healthy environment purposely retained and maintained at the RHC — frequented daily by several hundred people seeking medical treatment -- located along the Karachi-Thatta section of the National Highway. It is the most im­­por­­tant health facility available in the vast area and catering to the healthcare needs of a big population. Not only patients suffering from different diseases benefit from it, but those suffering injuries in traffic accidents on the roads leading to picnic points in Thatta and Makli also find it the nearest centre where emergency medical assistance is available. They urged the DC to stop further destruction of environment at the RHC.
Taking notice of the matter, DC Qadri constituted an inquiry committee comprising chief monitoring officer Dr Khalid Nawaz Qureshi, Dr Nazir Ahmed Khawaja and Dr Mehboob Katiyaar and asked it to submit a report to him through the Thatta district health officer.

Government and society should be taken on board, he stressed.
The president was speaking at a ceremony at the Technology Incubation Centre (TIC), Faculty of Engineering and Technology, University of Sindh, Jamshoro, through video link on Tuesday to seek ideas from students for solution to different problems and challenges.”Role of youth is very important for progress of Pakistan and wellbeing of people, therefore, they will be given more opportunities for education to help them complete their higher education,” he said.
Dr Alvi linked sustainable development with universities-industries collaboration and said that such an event could be important for solving problems at local level in the country. The Students enrolled at different institutions, including the Sindh University, were being awarded scholarships so that they could seek higher education hassle-free, he said.
Founder of the National Idea Bank (NIB) Hassan Syed urged youths to improve their careers by joining the ITC. He said it was all a matter of business ideas for success in world and much money could be earned by presenting successful business ideas on various issues.
Sir Syed University of Engineering and Technology (SSUET) vice chancellor Javed Anwar welcomed the youth to the event and appreciated their ideas. He said students could play a key role for development and progress of Pakistan.
Hyderabad Institute of Arts, Science and Technology (HIAST) director retired Colonel Mohammad Khalid said he was proud to be a part of the programme because he got an opportunity to know ideas given by the youth. “I am impressed by the ideas. I can now say there is no dearth of talent at SU,” he said. He added that such activities were significant to bring the biggest change in society.
Dean Faculty of Engineering and Technology Prof Dr Khalil-ur-Rehman Khombati said the event organised by the TIC was vital for students where innovative ideas could be expressed, shared and solutions to challenging problems could be explained.
Dr Arifa Bhutto shared details about practices and achievements of the National Idea Bank, Hyderabad. “We have more than 14,000 registered students,” she said, and added that the TIC would prepare more students for challenges being faced by the country in terms of unemployment.

11,Haleem wants Rangers deployed across Sindh to control crime,LARKANA: Leader of the opposition in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh on Tuesday visited the family of Pakistan...,"LARKANA: Leader of the opposition in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh on Tuesday visited the family of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) founder member Rana Sakhawat Rajput and condoled his death with them.
Mr Rajput, senior vice president of PTI’s Qambar-Shahdadkot district chapter, was shot dead and his nephew Zubair was wounded in an armed attack carried out by unknown assailants in his rice mills office in Lalurounk town on Friday.
Haleem Sheikh went to the grave of the deceased party fellow and offered fateha. He also examined the crime scene and noted that circumstantial evidence was not collected apparently to let it vanish.
Later, Mr Sheikh spoke to local reporters to condemn the murderous attack, and also Pakistan Peoples Party for giving it an ethnic colour. 
“Sakhawat Rajput was a close associate of of Prime Minister Imran Khan and a founding member of the PTI,” he said, adding that he
was an effective voice of the party in this far off area of Qambar Shahdadkot. “It was a blatant act of targeted attack on a brave political worker, who was shot dead in broad daylight and the assailants managed to escape,” he wondered.
Mr Sheikh deplored that some elements were trying to portray the incident as an “ethnically-motivated hate crime”. He alleged that Sindh government was using police force for achieving its personal goals. “Police have been politicised,” he remarked.
He observed that the PPP government had ruined Sindh. “In a bid to hide its failure, bad governance and corruption, [chief minister] Murad Ali Shah was creating hatred in the province by playing ‘Sindh card’,” he said, and deplored that the CM was describing federal government’s every move and action as an “attack on Sindh”.
He accused CM Shah of fomenting hatred and divisive sentiments on ethnic lines. “His irresponsible statements and divisive narrative do not represent vision of Shaheed Benazir Bhutto and policy of the the PPP that she headed,” he said.
Haleem Sheikh, who is also PTI’s vice president, held a press conference at Insaf House in Larkana on Tuesday to condemn the back to back incidents of heinous crime in Sindh over the last few weeks. He demanded deployment of Rangers across the province to check the trend and maintaining law and order.
