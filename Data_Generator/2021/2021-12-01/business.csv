0,"Senate panel, auto industry discuss ‘on-money’",Committee informed that the local industry is helpless in addressing the price hike issue.,"KARACHI:  The members of the Senate Standing Committee on Industries and  Production on Tuesday were critical about rising car prices and long delivery period that led to heavy premiums being charged by dealers on  locally assembled cars.
A four-member delegation of the committee  led by Senator Faisal Sabzwari visited the Lucky Motor Corporation Ltd  (LMCL) and Indus Motor Company (IMC). The committee members also  included Shaheen Khalid Butt, Fida Muhammad and Saifullah Sarwar Niazi.
Indus Motor Company (IMC) chief executive Ali Asghar Jamali told Dawn that the committee  members asked him as to how “on-money” can be controlled. “I have given a   suggestion to fix the registration of cars in the name of customers at   the dealers’ end in Karachi, Islamabad and Lahore initially. Besides, we   are also increasing production capacity to meet the increasing demand.”  
Mr  Jamali claimed that the committee members did not ponder  over rising  Toyota car prices. However, he said, “we have shown a  regional price  comparison in which Pakistani made Toyota Corolla has  still been the  cheapest.”
He informed the committee that the car prices comprise 35-40pc of government taxes.
Lucky Motor chief executive Asif Rizvi told Dawn that he informed the committee that the car and SUVs prices had gone up owing to rupee  depreciation against the dollar.
In May,  one dollar was quoted at Rs152-153 in the interbank market as  compared to Rs175 now, making imported kits more costlier. He said Lucky  Motors had not raised the prices of its product for the last two years, except  one model.
He said soaring freight rates and logistic issues had further played havoc with the cost of production.
One  of the main reasons for late deliveries of vehicles was the world-wide non-availability of semiconductor chips, which has also affected the local auto industry, he said.
The committee was informed that the local  industry is helpless in addressing the price hike issue which is related  to the exchange rate, chip shortage and rising freight rates, whose  impact is now evident in car and SUV prices. He said freight costs are  expected to increase further in January.
Mr Asif said he had  urged the committee members to ask the government to make an effort for  encouraging local production of a “Pakistan” car which would bring about  real localisation, boost employment, save precious foreign exchange  being spent on procurement of imported raw materials and encourage new  entrepreneurs towards future investment in the auto sector.
He  said the industry needs incentives and futuristic policies to promote  localisation levels in the vehicles in order to bring down prices and  improve the country’s employment base.
However, incentives which  were specified originally in the new Auto Policy 2021-2026 for  incentivising the production of ‘Pakistan’ car had been removed  in the new draft. He urged the committee members to look into this  matter.
He said the committee members said they would  send their recommendation to the government based on the outcome of the  plant visit.
The main purpose of the visit was to have an in-depth  insight into the quality, standards and manufacturing process of the  auto assemblers in order to make substantial recommendations/proposals  for the improvement of auto industry especially in keeping in view of  the services and benefit to the consumers.

1,Kinno export outlook sour amid rise in freight costs,"KARACHI: Kinno exports are likely to fall by 35 per cent year-on-year to 300,000 tonnes this season due to a...","KARACHI: Kinno exports are likely to fall by 35 per cent year-on-year to 300,000 tonnes this season due to a significant increase in sea freight costs and the adverse effect of climatic changes on the fruit’s production.
Waheed Ahmed, the patron-in-chief of All Pakistan Fruit and Vegetable Exporters, Importers and Merchants Association said on Tuesday the country’s kinno production is feared to drop to 1.7 million tonnes this year compared to 2.4m tonnes last year.
A few kinno factories in Sargodha were preparing for the export, he said. However, large-scale preparation to export the fruit had yet to begin, although the season was due to start from Dec 1 (today), he added.
Last year, kinno exports reached 450,000 tonnes against the target of 350,000 tonnes. However, due to the crisis of high sea freight costs this year, the exports were likely to suffer to the international markets of Russia, Canada, Ukraine, Indonesia, and the Philippines — the countries where Pakistan sent half of its kinno exports, he said.
The cost of sea freight to Russia, an important international market, was $2,500-3,000 per container during the previous season compared to the current rate of $7,000.

2,Govt to table bill for implementing WACOG: Hammad,"Analyst says move is unlikely to succeed in view of serious political resistance, especially from PPP.","KARACHI: Minister for Energy Hammad Azhar said on Tuesday the government will table a piece of legislation in parliament “shortly” to implement the weighted average cost of gas (WACOG).
“The government is currently unable to substitute depleting local gas with imported gas without incurring heavy financial losses,” he tweeted.

 



 
WACOG is the pricing mechanism that takes into account the blended costs of both indigenous and imported gas as opposed to the current pricing method, which ring-fences the use of imported fuel.
Under the 18th amendment to the constitution, a gas-producing province has the first right to its use. Therefore, gas-producing smaller provinces have been opposing WACOG which, they believe, will benefit Punjab at their expense.
Speaking to Dawn, Topline Securities Chief Economist Syed Atif Zafar said the move is unlikely to succeed in view of serious political resistance, especially from the PPP that’s in power in Sindh.
The gap between the price of imported LNG and the subsidised rate that a disproportionately large segment of consumers pays for it has contributed to the rising inter-corporate debt in the gas sector, which amounted to roughly Rs535 billion at the end of June.
The stock and the flow of the circular debt have been rising for the last three years as the country diverts imported LNG supplies every winter to the domestic sector, which pays a fraction of the real cost of fuel.
Some of the domestic-sector consumers pay as low as Rs120 a unit compared with the imported price of Rs2,000, according to Tabish Gauhar who stepped down as special assistant to the prime minister on power and petroleum in September. The circular debt originating from the domestic sector alone went up by Rs100bn over the last three years.
Mr Zafar of Topline Securities said the imported gas currently costs around $25-30 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). In contrast, the price of indigenous gas is $5-6 per mmBtu, he said. “WACOG should be around $10-11 per unit for all consumers based on the going rates,” he added.

3,"Outflows from equities, T-bills, PIBs double than inflows",KARACHI: Foreign investments leaving the domestic market were double than the inflows during the first five months ...,"KARACHI: Foreign investments leaving the domestic market were double than the inflows during the first five months of the current fiscal year (5MFY22). 
The latest data issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Tuesday showed that cumulative outflows from equities, treasury bill (T-bills) and Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs) were $816.6 million against an inflow of $407.8m during 5MFY22.  
The United States of America and the United Kingdom – the biggest investors in equities, T-bills and PIBs – were at the forefront in withdrawing their maximum investments during July-Nov FY22. 
Equities were hit the most as investments worth more than $505m – more than half a billion dollars –  were withdrawn during the period while inflows were at $179.7m in the period under review. T-bills saw inflows at $149.8m while outflows were $239m in 5MFY22.  
However, investment in PIBs fared slightly better as the inflows were higher than outflows. Investments during 5MFY22 were $78.2m while the outflows during the same period was $77.5m.
The overall investment scenario for all three options was not attractive as the biggest investors – USA and the UK – made the biggest disinvestment. 
During 5MFY22, investments from USA and the UK were 166.2m and $96.4m, respectively. Outflows during the period were $376.3m and $189.5m, respectively. The United Arab Emirates – which invested $86.7m – withdrew $43.6m. 
Bankers and analysts believe the sudden jump in interest rate which ultimately increased yields in these papers would be great attraction for the foreign investors. 
The SBP on November 19 increased the policy interest rate by 1.5pc to 8.75pc which suddenly increased the yields on the government papers in the secondary market. The government increased returns on PIBs by up to 246 basis points on Monday, thereby providing an added attraction for foreign investors who are unable to get such high returns from other markets.
The cut-off yield on three-year PIBs was increased to 11.34pc, five-year to 11.59pc and 10-year to 11.79pc. 
Analysts said PIBs rates have reached close to the pre-Covid times when the interest rate was at 13.25pc. The country attracted more than $3.5bn with such a high rate before the emergence of Covid-19 pandemic in the country in March 2020.
Following the pandemic, the central bank slashed interest rate to 7pc within three months and kept it the same for almost a year. However, rising inflation and fears of overheating economy compelled the SBP to increase the interest rate.

5,FBR collects Rs2.313 trillion in 5MFY22,Revenue collection posts 36pc growth.,"ISLAMABAD: The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) collected Rs2.313 trillion in the first five months of the current fiscal year (5MFY22), exceeding the target of Rs2.016tr by Rs297 billion, provisional data compiled by the tax body showed on Tuesday. 
Compared with the revenue collection of Rs1.695tr in 2020, the revenue collection posted 36.46 per cent growth in July-November this fiscal year.
The revenue collection in November rose by 35pc to Rs470bn from last year’s Rs348bn. The revenue collection stood at Rs470bn in November exceeding the target of Rs408bn by a margin of Rs62bn during the month under review.
These figures would further improve before the close of the day and after book adjustments have been taken into account.

Revenue collection posts 36pc growth

Adviser on Finance and Revenue Shaukat Tarin in a recent press conference said the new FBR revenue target will be Rs6.1tr. This target was revised upwards on the plea to keep the budget deficit at a committed place.
The finance adviser had already held a meeting with the International Monetary Fund in the middle of October in Washington as part of negotiations for the release of the sixth tranche under the $6bn Extended Fund Facility.
The final report or outcome of the negotiations is expected after the implementation of five prior actions committed with the IMF.
The government, while preparing the budget for the current year, had assured the IMF of raising Rs5.829tr in FY22 against Rs4.721tr collected in FY21.
The gross collections including refunds and rebates payments increased from Rs1.783tr during July-November 2020 to Rs2.437tr in the current financial year, showing an increase of 36.67pc.
The amount of refunds disbursed was Rs123bn during July-November 2021 compared to Rs88bn paid last year, reflecting an increase of 39.77pc. This is reflective of FBR’s resolve to fast-track refunds to prevent liquidity shortages in the industry.
With the rising import bill coupled with an increase in imports of smuggling-prone items on legal channels, Customs collection stood at Rs383bn during the first five months this year as against Rs264bn last year, indicating a hefty growth of 45pc. The target projected under Customs was Rs325bn for the period under review, which was surpassed by Rs58bn.
In November, Customs collection stood at Rs92bn against Rs58bn over the last year, reflecting an increase of 58.6pc.
The Income Tax (IT) collection during the first five months stood at Rs761bn as against the target of Rs705bn, showing an increase of Rs56bn. Its collection showed growth of 30.75pc when compared with Rs582bn collected during the same period last year.
In November, IT collection also surpassed last year collection of Rs138bn by Rs29bn to Rs109bn. However, it fell behind by Rs1bn when compared with a target of Rs139bn in November.

6,Rs4.74 per unit hike in power tariff for one month decided,The move will generate additional revenue of Rs60bn for Discos.,"ISLAMABAD: In a new record, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Tuesday firmed up charging an additional Rs4.74 per unit fuel cost to consumers for electricity they consumed in October so that ex-Wapda distribution companies (Discos) could mop up additional revenue of Rs60 billion in December.  
This was concluded at public hearing presided over by Nepra Chairman Tauseef H. Farooqui at the request of the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) which demanded that Discos should be allowed to charge Rs4.75 per unit additional fuel cost to consumers to raise Rs61bn next month.  
The Nepra case officers pointed out that about Rs1.77bn additional burden was because of violation of economic merit order and Rs1.69bn because of shortage of LNG. A representative of the CPPA explained that power companies had demanded 700 million cubic feet per day of LNG in October but total supplies stood at 606mmcfd.  

The move will generate additional revenue of Rs60bn for Discos

Nepra officials reported that furnace oil- based generation was higher at about 11 per cent than just 0.2pc estimated in reference price for October because some coal-based power plants, including Hub Power, were on outage for over six months and hence coal- based generation stood at 15pc of total generation instead of 25pc projected in reference price.  
It was reported that adverse generation mix resulted in Rs44bn higher fuel cost than estimated while remaining was on account of higher international fuel prices. Some past claims of Rs5.2bn are also part of the additional fuel cost.   
It was noted that power generation was almost 18pc higher in October 2021 against reference estimate and 11pc higher when compared to same month last year. It was, however, unclear if it was normal growth or on account of industrial support package.  
Nepra members said if such an increase in fuel cost was because of demand growth for cheap energy supply to industry then reconsideration was urgently required. Nepra decided to look into the issue itself and also asked the CPPA to join hands for such a review because it was a common decision of the government, the regulator and power companies and its fallback should be shared by all as all these institutions were answerable to the people.  
The regulator expressed concern that while such a massive increase in fuel cost was going to be borne by the consumers, the power division did not bother to attend the public hearing despite being one of the most important stakeholders.   
The regulator also raised questions over non-availability of a major coal plant of 600mw for almost six months. It was still unclear if it was actually caused by lightening as claimed by the sponsors or it was due to manufacturing fault as the government entities reported.  
The CPPA explained that in case of the company’s fault, the government could claim much higher damages for non-availability of the plant but then it had to be proved legally based on solid technical grounds and economic losses. Also, lower liquidity damages could be recovered from the power plant for normal unavailability but the sponsors of the plant tend to declare it as force majeure to avoid even liquidity damages.  
Members of the regulator expressed concern over violation of merit order, shortage of LNG and continuous outage of coal power plants and questioned why the power division had resisted much cheaper 12 renewable energy projects entailing average generation tariff of 3.5-3.7 cents or about Rs6per unit.  
The hearing was told that the share of inexpensive hydropower in overall power generation had been slightly lower than estimated but the increase in the prices of imported fuels – coal, LNG and furnace oil – had necessitated additional burden on consumers.  
On behalf of all ex-Wapda Discos, the CPPA claimed that the Discos had charged a reference fuel cost of Rs5.173 per unit to consumers in October, but the actual fuel cost turned out to be Rs9.93 per unit, up 58pc, hence an additional cost of Rs4.75 per unit should be charged to consumers. After some adjustments, Nepra worked out additional fuel cost of Rs4.74per unit and would notify it in a couple of days.  
The higher electricity rates, on notification by the regulator, would be recovered from all consumers in the coming billing month – December, except those using less than 50 units per month.  
The share of hydropower supply stood at 23.26pc in October instead of 25.48pc estimated in reference tariff. However, hydropower was significantly lower than 36.24pc in September, 35pc in August and had no fuel cost. On the other hand, LNG-based power contribution stood at 23.93pc in October against 25.4pc estimated. It was, however, higher than 18.9pc in September and 18pc in August.  
The CPPA reported that total energy generation from all sources in October stood at 11,296 gigawatt hour (GWh) at a cost of Rs105.06bn or Rs9.3 per unit. Of this, about 10,98 GWh were delivered to the Discos at Rs109bn, at an average rate of Rs9.93 per unit.  
The generation from furnace oil-based plants stood at 11pc in October against 7.1pc in September and 10.12pc in August. The share of RLNG-based power generation to the national grid stood about 24pc in October against 19pc in September and 18pc in August. The share of local gas-based generation slightly increased to 9.67pc in October against 8.9pc in September and 8.17pc in August.  
On the other hand, the share of nuclear power increased to 12.33pc in October against 9.13pc in September and 10pc in August.
