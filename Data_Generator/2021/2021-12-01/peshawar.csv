3,KP cabinet okays child protection bill after removal of controversial part,Clause suggested release of video of assault convict’s execution.,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa cabinet on Tuesday approved the draft Child Protection and Welfare (Amendment) Act, 2021, after removing a controversial clause for publicly releasing video recordings of the execution of the convicts of sexual assault against children.
The cabinet met here with Chief Minister Mahmood Khan in the chair and ministers and administrative secretaries in attendance.
Briefing reporters about the cabinet’s decisions, higher education minister Kamran Khan Bangash said the cabinet approved amendments to the proposed Child Protection and Welfare Act.

Clause suggested release of video of assault convict’s execution

Last year, the bill was referred to a ministerial committee headed by labour minister Shaukat Yousafzai after a controversy emerged over a clause about the release of the videos of the execution of those convicted of sexual assaults against children.
Law minister Fazl Shakoor Khan told Dawn that the cabinet approved the draft of the bill prepared by the ministerial committee insisting that Pakistan was a signatory to the UN convention on human rights, so the release of execution videos would cause problems for it globally.
He said the committee’s recommendation didn’t sit well with some cabinet members, who advocated the release of execution videos to prevent crimes against children.
The minister said during the cabinet meeting, the chief minister asked the committee to look into that aspect at length.
The draft law has a 14-year prison term and Rs5 million fine for the convicts of child pornography and 10-year jail for those harassing and blackmailing children by videos.
Also, the convicts of child trafficking will be sentenced up to 25 years jail and Rs5 million fine.
In addition, the law also allows the display of the names of child assault convicts on the website of the KP Child Protection Commission and their mention in a special register.
Also, a ban will be slapped on the employment of those convicts in public and private sector organisations and use of public transport vehicles by them.
Mr Bangash said the cabinet also approved the proposed Press, Newspapers, News Agencies and Book Registration (Amendment) Act, 2021, allowing the transfer of the declaration of publications to any person besides blood relations of the owners.
He, however, said the transfer would only be approved after 10 years of the initial declaration in the name of the owner.
The minister said the cabinet also approved the transfer of administrative control of the provincial ombudsman’s offices from the social welfare department to the law department.
He said since most of the ombudsman office’s affairs were legal, it would be better taken care by the law department.
Mr Bangash said that ombudsman’s office in federal and other provinces was also under the law department.
The minister said the cabinet also approved a supplementary grant of Rs2.677 billion for the supply of natural gas to districts producing it.
The cabinet also approved 10-marla plots each to all members of the Peshawar Press Club in the proposed New Peshawar Valley.
Mr Bangash also said an information complex would be set up in the proposed housing project.
He said 10-marla plots in the scheme would be given away to all 564 members of the Peshawar Press Club.
The cabinet also approved rules for the maintenance of national parks in the province.
It also approved the Management of Youth Hostels Rules, 2021, for the establishment and maintenance of hostels.
The cabinet approved the establishment of a committee for disposal of the police department’s redundant weapons on the recommendation of the Public Accounts Committee. Approval was also granted to the nomination of members for academic research committee meant to make recommendations for the vacancies of vice-chancellors for seven public sector universities in the province. It will be sent to the chancellor for mandatory approval.

“The situation necessitates that fresh general elections should be held to take the country out of the prevailing crises,” Mr Sherpao said while talking to mediapersons after attending funeral prayers of the wife of his personal secretary Ali Asghar Khan in Malikyar village here. 
He said that the record price hike had exposed the people to mental stress to the level that they were committing suicides as they were unable to feed their children. 
“The prevailing situation clearly indicates that the government has no policy to provide any relief to the masses,” the QWP chairman said, adding the agenda of ‘change’ of the ruling PTI had increased the poverty ratio in the country. He said the rulers had themselves rendered thousands of people jobless despite their hollow promises of new jobs. Answering a question, Mr Sherpao said the people were left with the only option of ousting this inept govt to get out of the prevailing crisis. 
“We just need to remove the PTI government for protecting the country from further devastation,” Mr Sherpao said and called for holding free, fair and transparent elections. 
About the use of electronic voting machines in next general election, he said the PDM had already rejected the legislation about the EVMs.

7,Four die in Peshawar as govt expedites Covid vaccination,First dose of vaccine has been given to 54pc of target people in KP,"PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa recorded four more mortalities, all from Peshawar, due to coronavirus and 80 new cases on Tuesday as health department ordered acceleration of vaccination efforts to inoculate the target population.
Health Secretary Mohammad Tahir Orakzai issued a notification regarding launching a special three-day drive from December 1 to December 3. 
It said that focused effort was part of the obligatory regime during which all target people would be administered shots against coronavirus. 
The drive was in line with the decision of National Command and Operation Centre to run a focused immunisation drive from Wednesday.
Through the notification, all the administrative secretaries of line departments have been asked to redouble the efforts to inoculate more people during the second phase of vaccination against the virus.

First dose of vaccine has been given to 54pc of target people in KP

The progress made during the effort will be of more significance in overall performance of the province against the pandemic.
Officials in health department said that Covid-19 immunisation suffered a slump as most of the health staff was busy in the 12-day measles and rubella drive that ended on November 28. 
“Emphasis is now being laid on coverage of more population against pandemic to make up for the dip caused during measles campaign,” they added.
So far, first dose has been administered to 54 per cent and second shot to 38 per cent of the target 24.2 million people.
The health secretary told Dawn that the government wanted to push vaccination because it was the only way to stay protected against the infection.
“All those, who have received the first dose, must get the second shot not only for their own safety but for others also. We are in contact with all government departments to ensure very positive outcome of the move, which will be started in all districts,” he said.
Mr Orakzai said that the routine vaccination process would remain in place but the special effort was meant to give injections to more people at places like markets, hospitals, educational institutions and others. 
He said that scaling public awareness regarding significance of vaccination was also part of the drive.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has lost 5,846 persons to Covid-19 since March 2020 while the number of cases in the province is 180,075, according to a report of health department report. 
Of the new cases, 49 (61 per cent) are from Peshawar, which has also recorded 2,821 deaths, 48.25 per cent of the province-wide fatalities.
Of the infected people, 96 per cent have recovered and 454 are in quarantine in government centres while 235 patients including 17 on ventilators have been admitted to hospitals.
Except Peshawar, the hardest-hit district, positivity rate is 1.8 per cent in other areas while it is below one per cent in all other high risk districts. 
The ratio of deaths due to the pandemic has been three mortalities per day since November 1. 
The daily positivity in the province has dropped below one per cent since November 16.
Health officials said that regardless of decline in cases and mortalities, vaccination against Covid-19 would continue as usual to meet the target by end of the year.
“Without immunisation and adherence to Covid-19 precautions, we cannot return to normal lives. Therefore, the only option is vaccine, which is available free of cost at 700 centres located in the government health facilities,” they said.
