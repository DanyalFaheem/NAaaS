0,French police evict migrants from camp on Channel coast,"Evictions at Grande-Synthe site have been taking place on a weekly basis for the past few weeks, charity worker says.","GRANDE: Police on Tue­sday tore down a makeshift camp near the northern Fre­nch port of Dunkirk where scores of migrants who say they are fleeing war, poverty and persecution in the Middle East were hunkered down with hopes of reaching Britain.
Armed officers entered the camp, which runs along a disused railway line, before workers in protective suits pulled down tents and plastic shelters.
Charity workers say the 27 migrants who drowned in the Channel last Wednesday had stayed in the same area before they attempted the perilous sea crossing from France to Britain. Their dinghy deflated in the open sea.
The number of migrants crossing the Channel has surged to 25,776 in 2021, up from 8,461 in 2020 and 1,835 in 2019, according to tallies compiled by the BBC using Home Office data.
The spike in numbers has angered Britain, which accu­ses France of doing too little to stem the flow. Paris says that once migrants reach the shores of the channel, it is too late to prevent them crossing.
French police routinely tear up the camps that spring up between Calais and Dunkirk. Evictions at the Grande-Synthe site had been taking place on a weekly basis for the past few weeks, one charity worker said.
The migrants are typically transported to holding centres scattered across the country where they are encouraged to file for asylum, though many quickly make their way back to the Channel coast.
Hussein Hamid, 25, an Iranian Kurd, said it was the second time he had been evicted. On the first occasion, he was bussed to Lyon 760km to the south.

1,Pakistani among four dead in Barcelona fire,Police open investigation into the fire at the abandoned bank.,"BARCELONA: A four-month-old baby and his three-year-old brother died with their parents on Tuesday when a fire ripped through an abandoned bank in Barcelona where the family was squatting, in a blaze denounced as “horrific” by the Spanish city’s mayor.
The couple, a 40-year-old man and his 39-year-old partner, used to collect scrap metal, Barcelona city hall said, saying the children were two boys, one aged three, the other just four months.
According to La Vanguardia newspaper, he was from Pakistan and she from Romania.
Chief firefighter Angel Lopez said the alarm was raised at around 6am (0500 GMT) by a witness who spotted the fire in a former bank building in the central Plaza de Tetuan.
It was only while they were battling the fire that they realised there were four people inside: “two adults, a baby and a three-year-old boy”, Lopez said.
“Emergency services tried to revive them, but they couldn’t save them.” 
“There are no words to describe the horror of four people dying, among them two very young children, this is something that should never have happened...It is horrible news,” Barcelona mayor Ada Colau told reporters at the scene, herself a former activist against evictions.
Neighbours who lived in a flat above the premises which was not harmed in the fire, said they could hear the family screaming for help.
“My wife smelled something burning, we got up and saw nothing but when we went to the place where we keep the washing machine, there was a huge amount of smoke,” said Miquel Guimera.
‘Screaming for help’
“Downstairs in the squat they were screaming for help, because they were locked in. It was quite traumatic,” he said, indicating the family had been living in the squat for two or three years.
“It’s a real shame about those two little children.” 
Four men who had run into a courtyard to escape the flames were rescued and taken to hospital for smoke inhalation, Lopez said.
Police have opened an investigation into the fire, which took place in a lively middle-class residential neighbourhood in the heart of Barcelona.
By sunrise, the building — with its former sign blacked out and its facade spray painted with graffiti — was cordoned off with emergency vehicles parked outside as rescuers came and went.
Colau said social workers knew the premises and had been there to offer food handouts to the occupants along with information on how to get medical care.
“Behind this tragedy was a situation of poverty, social exclusion and homelessness that was quite complex to manage as a city council,” said Laura Perez, one of  Barcelona’s senior social rights officials.
She said the family had been receiving support from city hall since August last year and the three-year-old was in school.
Hours before the fire broke out, police were called to the building because of a dispute, but there was no immediate evidence it was related to the blaze, a regional minister told reporters.
The blaze had echos of another fire that killed four in December last year when it ripped through a disused industrial complex near Barcelona that was occupied by squatters, many of them African migrants.
Another 20 people were hurt when they jumped out of windows to escape the flames and choking smoke.

2,US warns Russia against Ukraine ‘aggression’,"“We have seen Russia’s playbook many times over,” says US secretary of state.","RIGA: The United States on Tuesday warned Russia of  “serious consequences” if it launches an invasion of Ukraine, as Nato ministers looked to counter a military build-up by Moscow on its neighbour’s border.
The long-scheduled meeting of Nato top diplomats in Latvia’s capital Riga comes at a volatile moment along the bloc’s eastern flank as allies also grapple with a migrant crisis the West says is fuelled by Kremlin-backed Belarus.
Western countries spearheaded by the US worry that Moscow could be planning an incursion into Ukraine after accusing the Kremlin of massing tens of thousands of troops and heavy armour close to the frontier.
“Any escalatory actions by Russia would be of great concern to the United States... and any renewed aggression would trigger serious consequences,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told journalists ahead of the meeting.
“We have seen Russia’s playbook many times over.” Moscow, which seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and backs separatists fighting Kiev, has strongly denied it is plotting an attack and blames Nato for fuelling tensions.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday that military exercises and other moves by the West and Ukraine threaten Russia’s security, warning against crossing the Kremlin’s  “red lines”.
“Look, they spoke about a possible Russian military intervention in Ukraine at the beginning of the year. But as you see this did not happen,” Putin said.
The new build-up follows a similar surge in the spring, when Russia gathered around 100,000 troops on Ukraine’s borders but later announced a drawdown.
Nato diplomats say the bloc remains uncertain of Putin’s intentions this time round — but ministers will discuss contingency plans should Russia invade. The US-led alliance is looking to show the Kremlin it faces severe costs if it threatens Ukraine, while stopping short of provoking Moscow into further aggression.
Officials expect talks on additional support for Ukraine’s military and potentially a move to strengthen Nato forces arrayed along its eastern wing.
But they point out that Nato-aspirant Ukraine — which will have its foreign minister arriving for day two of the meeting on Wednesday — is not covered by the alliance’s collective defence pact.
Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said alliance members had  “different options” to respond if Russia moved on Ukraine.
“We have demonstrated over the years in reaction to Russia’s previous use of military force against Ukraine that we can sustain heavy economic and financial sanctions, political sanctions,” he said.
The growing fears around Ukraine come as Nato members Poland, Lithuania and Latvia have faced another threat coming from the east that will be high on the agenda in Riga. They accuse Moscow’s ally Belarus of funnelling thousands of mainly Middle Eastern migrants to their borders in a  “hybrid attack” as retribution for EU sanctions against Minsk. President Alexander Lukashenko rejects the claim.
Nato has expressed  “solidarity” with its eastern members, but has largely been left on the sidelines as the threat level floats in a grey zone just short of actual aggression.
Poland’s President Andrzej Duda mooted increasing Nato force numbers deployed on its eastern flanks at a meeting with Stoltenberg last week.
But a move to trigger emergency consultations under article 4 of the alliance’s founding treaty appears to have been put on hold for now.
Border tensions have eased slightly as some migrants have begun returning to Iraq, but Warsaw and Vilnius insist the crisis is far from over.
The European Union, US and other Nato members are set to hit Belarus with a fresh raft of sanctions in the coming days.

3,Afghan refugee sets himself on fire in Indonesia,The man has been in the Southeast Asian country since the beginning of 2016.,"MEDAN: An Afghan asylum seeker set himself on fire in Indonesia on Tuesday in protest at his seven-year wait for resettlement in a third country, a local refugee coordinator said.
The man suffered severe burns and was sent to hospital.
He was taking part in a rally with other displaced Afghans outside the office of the United Nations refugee agency in Medan on Sumatra island, coordinator Muhammad Juma said. Thousands of refugees, more than half from Afghanistan, are stuck in limbo in Indonesia while they wait for resettlement elsewhere, as Jakarta prohibits them from working legally.
The man has been in the Southeast Asian country since the beginning of 2016, Juma told journalists.
The coordinator said at least 14 Afghan refugees had taken their own lives in Indonesia in recent years and six others had attempted suicide. He called on the Indonesian government and the UN to do more to address their plight.
Mitra Salima Suryono, a spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said the agency was closely following the incident.

4,"MI6 spy chief terms China, Russia & Iran biggest threat for UK","LONDON: China, which is increasingly flexing its muscles around the world, is one of the biggest threats to Britain...","LONDON: China, which is increasingly flexing its muscles around the world, is one of the biggest threats to Britain and its allies, and a miscalculation” by Beijing could lead to war, the head of the UK’s foreign intelligence agency said on Tuesday.
MI6 chief Richard Moore said that China, Russia, Iran and international terrorism make up the big four security issues facing Britain’s spies in an unstable world where both countries and illicit organisations are racing to exploit fast-changing information technology.
In his first public speech since becoming head of the Secret Intelligence Service, also known as MI6, in October 2020, Moore said China is the intelligence agency’s single greatest priority as the country’s leadership increasingly backs bold and decisive action to further its interests.
Calling China an authoritarian state with different values than ours, he said Beijing conducts large-scale espionage operations against the UK and its allies, tries to distort public discourse and political decision-making and exports technology that enables a web of authoritarian control around the world.
Beijing’s growing military strength and the party’s desire to resolve the Taiwan issue, by force if necessary, also pose a serious challenge to global stability and peace,” Moore said.
The Chinese Communist Party increasingly favour decisive action justified on national security grounds. Beijing believes its own propaganda about Western frailties and under-estimates Washingtons resolve. The risk of Chinese miscalculation through overconfidence is real.
Moore said the UK also continues to face an acute threat from Russia. He said Moscow has sponsored killing attempts, such as the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal in England in 2018, mounts cyberattacks and attempts to interfere in other countries democratic processes.
We and our allies and partners must stand up to and deter Russian activity which contravenes the international rules-based system, the MI6 chief said.
No country in Europe or beyond should be seduced into thinking that unbalanced concessions to Russia bring better behavior,” he said, noting Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and its recent buildup of troops near the border with Ukraine.
His comments are the latest warnings from senior British officials aimed at deterring Moscow from further incursions in Ukraine.
Moore said Iran also poses a major threat, and uses the political and militant group Hezbollah a state within a state to fuel political turmoil in neighboring countries.
Turning to non-state threats, he said the fall of Afghanistan’s internationally backed government and the return to power of the Taliban were a morale boost to militants.
I won’t soft soap it: The threat we face will likely grow now we have left Afghanistan,” Moore said though he also said it would be overblown to call the surprise speed of the Taliban’s takeover a Western intelligence failure.
He argued that Britain’s spies must give up some of their deep-rooted secrecy and seek help from technology firms to win a cybersecurity arms race that is giving hostile countries and groups ever more capacity.
Moore, speaking at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, said the disruptive potential of artificial intelligence and other rapidly developing technologies means the spy agency has to become more open to stay secret in a world of destabilising technological change.

5,"After first woman PM, Sweden gets its first trans minister",Her government portfolio covers primary and secondary schools.,"STOCKHOLM: Sweden’s new Schools Minister Lina Axelsson Kihlblom on Tuesday became the first transgender person to become a government minister in the Nordic country, a year after the appointment of Europe’s first transgender minister.
The 51-year-old former school principal and lawyer was added to the Social Democratic government by Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson, who also became the first woman to hold that post.
In her 2015 book  “Will You Love Me Now?”, Axelsson Kihlblom described growing up as a girl in a boy’s body and her physical transition to a woman’s body, which was completed when she was 25.
“Trans people have always existed, they will always exist and we no longer feel ashamed. We are the new normal,” she wrote in an article published in 2018 by public broadcaster SVT.
Divorced and the mother of two adopted children, her government portfolio covers primary and secondary schools, while Education Minister Anna Ekstrom will be in charge of higher education.
In October 2020, a member of the European Parliament, Petra De Sutter, was named Belgium’s deputy prime minister and became the first transgender minister in Europe.
Audrey Tang of Taiwan is considered to have become the world’s first openly transgender government minister in 2016.

6,Moderna boss speaks of uphill battle against Omicron,"“All the scientists I’ve talked to are like ‘this is not going to be good’,” he says.","LONDON: Existing Covid-19 inoculations will struggle against the fast-spreading Omicron variant, the head of vaccine manufacturer Moderna warned on Tuesday, as countries ramp up vaccination programmes and impose further restrictions in an effort to curb growing concern.
First reported to the World Health Organisation in South Africa less than a week ago, the new strain has rapidly spread from Africa to the Pacific, and from Europe to North America as dozens of countries have announced travel restrictions.
While no deaths have yet been reported from Omicron, and it could take weeks to know how infectious and how resistant the strain may prove to vaccines, its emergence underscores how besieged the world remains by Covid-19, nearly two years after the first cases were recorded.
Stephane Bancel, the head of US vaccine manufacturer Moderna, told the Financial Times in an interview published on Tuesday that data would be available on the effectiveness of vaccines in the two weeks’ time, but that scientists were pessimistic.
“All the scientists I’ve talked to ... are like ‘this is not going to be good’,” Bancel said, warning against a “material drop” in the effectiveness of current jabs against Omicron.
Moderna, US drugmaker Pfizer and the backers of Russian vaccine Sputnik V have all announced that they are already working on an Omicron-specific vaccine.
Scientists in South Africa said they had detected the new variant with at least 10 mutations, compared with three for Beta or two for Delta — the strain that hit the global recovery and sent millions worldwide back into lockdown.
China warned that the fast-spreading Omicron variant would cause challenges in hosting next February’s Winter Olympics in Beijing, with thousands of athletes, media and participants arriving from overseas required to enter a strict “closed-loop” bubble.
Urgent action
“I think it will definitely lead to challenges linked to prevention and control,” foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said.
“But China has a lot of experience in responding to Covid-19,” Zhao added.
“I firmly believe the Winter Olympics will be conducted smoothly.” On Monday, US President Joe Biden said the strain was “a cause for concern, not a cause for panic”, stressing that he does not foresee new lockdowns or extending travel restrictions for now.
G7 health ministers called for “urgent action” to combat the Omicron variant.
The WHO said the overall risk from Omicron was “very high” and warned that any major surge would put pressure on health systems and cause more deaths.
Omicron could slow the recovery of the US economy and labour market and heighten uncertainty over inflation, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is to tell the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday.
Governments, particularly in western Europe, had already struggled with rapid rises in case numbers and have reintroduced mandatory mask-wearing, social-distancing measures, curfews or lockdowns — leaving businesses fearing another grim Christmas.
Germany’s outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel was to meet remotely with her successor, Olaf Scholz, and regional leaders on Tuesday on whether to toughen up restrictions to tame raging infections in the European Union’s largest economy.
Germany’s constitutional court has ruled that sweeping restrictions such as curfews, school closures and contact restrictions were lawful, likely to pave the way for further curbs with hospitals, already over capacity, long sounding the alarm.
“Contacts must be reduced,” said Germany’s vice-chancellor-in-waiting Robert Habeck, calling for tougher restrictions such as banning unvaccinated people from “all public facilities” apart from essential shops.

7,Court delays verdict  in Suu Kyi trial,NAYPYIDAW: A Myanmar junta court on Tuesday postponed giving a verdict in the trial of deposed civilian leader Aung...,"NAYPYIDAW: A Myanmar junta court on Tuesday postponed giving a verdict in the trial of deposed civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who faces a catalogue of charges that could see her jailed for decades.
The Nobel laureate has been detained since the generals ousted her government in the early hours of Feb 1, ending the Southeast Asian country’s brief democratic interlude.
More than 1,200 people have been killed and over 10,000 arrested in a crackdown on dissent, according to a local monitoring group.
The court, which had been expected to rule on her trial for incitement against the military — a charge that carries a three-year prison term — adjourned the verdict  “until Dec 6,” said a source with knowledge of the case.
A verdict on a separate charge that Suu Kyi breached coronavirus restrictions during elections her party won last year — punishable by six months in jail or a fine — was deferred to the same date.
Journalists have been barred from proceedings in the special court in the military-built capital Naypyidaw and Suu Kyi’s lawyers were recently banned from speaking to the media. There was a heavy security presence on the streets leading to the court on Tuesday morning, a correspondent said, and the road to the parliament building was blocked by troops. David Mathieson, an analyst formerly based in Myanmar, said it was a  “bizarre postponement”.
