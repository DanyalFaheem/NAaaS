0,At least 20 injured in pile-up on M-2 motorway,Motorists criticised the NH&MP for not generating alerts despite knowing about the smog and fog on the motorway.,"LAHORE: As many as 20 people, including women and children, were injured on Tuesday morning in a chain collision involving several vehicles on the motorway near Sheikhupura interchange due to poor visibility caused by fog.
The video clips [that went viral] showed several damaged vehicles and people standing helplessly around them amid a thick blanket of fog.
In two other accidents occurred in Bahawalpur on Tuesday, two people were killed and as many suffered injuries. The reason was said to be foggy weather, according to Rescue 1122 personnel Abdul Rahim.
An official of the National Highways and Motorways Police (NH&MP) said nearly 30 vehicles, mostly cars, were involved in the pile-up near Sheikhupura when they were coming from Islamabad to Lahore early on Tuesday.
He said some vehicles got damaged almost completely in the chain-reaction crash after they overturned while applying emergency brakes and struck into the divider on the motorway.
The witnesses said many speeding cars hit the other vehicles multiple times, as the drivers could not find sufficient time to stop or slow down.
The multiple pile-up threw traffic out of gear, besides creating an emergency situation in the area.
The NH&MP officials declared the poor weather condition caused by smog as one of the major reasons for the accident.
However, the motorists criticised the NH&MP for not generating alerts despite knowing about the smog and fog on the motorway.
Several ambulances of the Rescue 1122 rushed to the site and shifted them to nearby hospitals.
A few of them were referred to Lahore’s teaching hospitals due to multiple injuries, the motorway police said adding that none of them was said to be critical.
Earlier, on [last] Sunday morning, a person had died while 15 others, including four members of a family, got injured when five vehicles collided with each other near a resting area on motorway at Hafizabad due to smog.
The multiple-vehicle collisions continued to occur on motorway due to abnormal climatic conditions while no important step was taken by the NH&MP and other authorities to prevent such incidents.
In May this year, several people were injured after a chain collision involving more than three dozen vehicles on the Lahore-Islamabad Motorway near Kala Shah Kaku due to poor visibility caused by torching of stubble.
At that time, much was trumpeted to sensitise the motorway police and district authorities of Sheikhpura but with no tangible outcome of the efforts to prevent such future chain accidents.

1,Marriyum raps Fawad’s ‘price cut’ remark,LAHORE: PML-N leader Marriyum Aurangzeb has asked information minister Fawad Chaudhry to at least not make fun of ...,"LAHORE: PML-N leader Marriyum Aurangzeb has asked information minister Fawad Chaudhry to at least not make fun of the people of Pakistan, who were already burdened by poverty because of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s ‘disastrous rule’.
Responding to the Fawad’s tweet about the decrease in prices of some food items, Ms Aurangzeb said on Tuesday the minister should listen to the screams, curses, cries and demands of the masses instead of “making fun” of their misery.
“Tweeting by ministers will not help in giving the people affordable flour, sugar, electricity, gas and vegetables. If they cannot do anything to make the lives of the people less miserable, they should at least learn to keep their mouths shut,” she said.
The PML-N central spokesperson asked why the PTI ministers tortured the nation “with lies, and their humiliating, deriding and ridiculing comments”.
“The only way to end this flour, sugar, electricity, gas, medicine crises is the departure of the Imran mafia. Instead of tweeting falsely, Fawad should ask Imran to leave the PM’s office, and spare this country and its people. Imran Niazi has turned a deaf ear to the cries of every section of society that is out on the streets to protests against his tyrannical and murderous rule. Traders, teachers, doctors, students and businessmen are on the streets while the so-called premier acts as if they do not exist,” she said and added that industrialists, workers, and even government employees were protesting “against the tyranny of Imran”.
Meanwhile, PML-N president and opposition leader in National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif has termed the economic situation in the country ‘dangerous’.
In a statement on Tuesday, he said if this PTI government stayed in power then next year a loan would have to be be taken even for defence expenditures, government employees’ salaries and to run its affairs.
After the rising current account deficit, loan would have to be taken in dollars, he warned.

2,"Lawyers torture judge who convicted DC, AC in Mandi Bahauddin",The judge had convicted the deputy and assistant commissioners for contempt and issued a show-cause notice to their leader.,"GUJRAT: The tussle between a consumer court judge and the district administration officers in Mandi Bahauddin took an ugly turn on Tuesday when a group of lawyers, in support of the district bar association president who had represented the deputy commissioner (DC) in a contempt case, allegedly thrashed and manhandled the judge in his court.
The judge had convicted the deputy commissioner and the assistant commissioner for contempt and issued a show-cause notice to their leader.
Scores of lawyers stormed the consumer court in protest against the issuance of a show-cause notice to DBA President Zahid Gondal by the judge for allegedly forcing him not to take action against DC Tariq Basra and AC Imtiaz Ali Baig for contempt of court.
While convicting the DC and AC, the judge had also issued a show-cause notice to the DBA president and sought his reply until Dec 1.
The lawyers thrashed the judge, pulled him out his seat and put him into his official vehicle and locked the courtroom.

Both officers booked, transferred; case also against DBA president

Police, supposed to be present in the court, were missing during the alleged attack of the lawyers. The judge called police who arrived late and judge entered his courtroom in police protection.
After the incident, judge Rao Abdul Jabbar registered a case against DC Basra, AC Baig, litigation clerk Rana Mahboob, DBA President Gondal and general secretary Yasir Arafat.
The bar office-bearers have been booked for attacking and torturing the judge and hurling abuses and life threats at him while the administration officers have been booked for instigating the lawyers for the attack.
In retaliation, the Mandi Bahauddin DBA announced a strike of the court proceedings.
Meanwhile, the Punjab government transferred DC Basra, AC Imtiaz Ali, District Police Officer Sajid Khokhar and DSP Muhammad Shabbir.
Sources in the administration told Dawn the removal of the officers had been made in the wake of the torture of the judge.
According to separate notifications issued by the Punjab government, Mandi Additional Deputy Commissioner Revenue Ehsanul Haq Zia and SP investigation Anwar Saeed Tahir have been given the additional charges of DC and DPO offices, respectively, whereas the charge of AC has not been given to anyone yet.
The court had convicted both the officers for contempt of court while hearing an application of a citizen against the district administration for his forced eviction from a house in Wapda Colony after allotting the same house to a teacher.
On being summoned to the court on misbehaviour of the clerk with the judge, both the officers appeared where the DC also misbehaved with the judge.
As they could not satisfy the court as to why they should not be tried for contempt, the judge convicted them and ordered the DPO to shift both the convicts to the Gujrat District Jail.
However, instead of shifting them to jail, the police had shifted them to the DC house after arresting them from the court and they later left for Lahore where they filed an appeal for suspension of their conviction two days later.
On Monday, Lahore High Court Chief Justice Ameer Bhatti suspended the conviction orders and three-month sentence to the officers and ordered their release on bail.
Consumer court judge Rao Abdul Jabbar has been a district and session judge.

3,Punjab chief secretary told to ensure recitation of Darood Sharif at school assemblies,"The Punjab Assembly had in September passed a (non-binding) resolution, asking schools to recite Darood Sharif in the assemblies.","LAHORE: On the directions of Chief Minister Usman Buzdar, the chief secretary has been told to arrange the recitation of Darood Sharif (Darood-i-Ibrahimi) before the national anthem and after the recitation of the Holy Quran in schools’ assemblies.
In this regard, the chief minister said Darood Sharif had immense virtues. It is an honour for every Muslim to offer Darood Sharif in the honour of Rehmatul Alameen Hazrat Muhammad (PBUH), he added.
The Punjab Assembly has earlier passed a (non-binding) resolution in the last week of September, asking schools to recite Darood Sharif in the assemblies.
Meanwhile, the chief minister inaugurated a tea shop, Punjab’s first literary museum and adabi baithak at Majlis-i-Taraqqi-i-Adab (Board for Advancement of Literature) on Tuesday and laid the foundation stone of the e-library block. He took a keen interest in items belonging to Allama Iqbal, poets and intellectuals at Lahore literary museum while viewing a place for storytelling.
Culture Minister Khayal Ahmad Kastro, SACM Hasaan Khawar and director Mansoor Afaq were also present.
Talking to the literati, the chief minister said several steps were taken for the welfare of writers and poets, adding that membership cards were being issued to writers and poets by the Board for Advancement of Literature to provide financial assistance through the writers’ welfare fund.
They would be able to get books at subsidized rates besides accessing the antique books of the Board for Advancement of Literature, he maintained. They would also be able to benefit from any of the writers’ welfare schemes, he repeated.
He said Unesco has declared Lahore a city of literature and a Lahore literary park was being established in the city.
Also, awards would be given to selected poetry and prose books under the aegis of Board for Advancement of Literature every year, the chief minister said and stated that awards would also be given to best prose, poem and ghazal.
The government was going to launch the first Urdu e-reader comprising of ten thousand books, initially, to promote the Urdu language, he said. Similarly, a library of manuscripts would be established where five copies of each document would be preserved which can also be accessed online, he added.

4,Probe into ETPB ‘irregularities’: FIA wants AGP to convene ‘mandatory’ accounts committee meeting,FIA has sought the record of the alleged irregularities mentioned in the AGP’s report from the  Evacuee Trust Property Board.,"LAHORE: As the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has launched a probe into alleged irregularities in the sale of urban properties by the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB), the agency has written to the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) office, requesting it to first convene ‘mandatory’ departmental accounts committee (DAC) of the ministry on its (AGP’s) observations to have a black and white picture of the asymmetries.
The FIA has sought the record regarding the alleged irregularities mentioned in the AGP’s report from the ETPB whose headquarters is in Lahore.
“Some 1,800 files regarding the [ETPB] record of old city (Lahore) urban sub-units have been found missing,” a well-placed source in the FIA told Dawn on Tuesday.
He said the AGP’s report served as a starting point of the agency’s investigation as it would go for physical verification of the alleged irregularities committed by the board during the last several decades.
“In addition to the senior officials, the FIA will also quiz some former heads of the board regarding the sale of the properties during their tenure,” he added.
The FIA, on the direction of the Supreme Court, has initiated the probe on the AGP’s report about alleged irregularities of over Rs77 billion in the sale of 7,143 urban properties in different parts of the country owned by the ETPB.
The board, meanwhile, has requested the AGP to convene the ministry’s mandatory DAC on its observations so that it is established which one of these was upgraded in audit paras.
“This will facilitate the job of both the FIA and the ETPB with regard to alleged irregularities in the sale of properties,” a source said and added that the AGP’s report was directly submitted to the apex court in contradiction to the auditing standards.
“As a result of this, the ETPB’s version was not recorded, and it was condemned unheard with the impression of being guilty,” he added.
The board’s letter to the AGP says: “Audit report is mostly based on surmises and conjectures. The report was too haphazardly submitted before the court, most of the properties/matters involved in litigation before the courts were included. The matter of vital importance like geotagging/survey initiated on direction by the cabinet/prime minister has also been declared controversial. Now ETPB is clarifying to the FIA merely on ‘draft observations’ along with on such petty issues which are rectifiable under the law.”
The board requested the rules/procedure of the AGP regarding submission of the audit report after including the view point of ETPB and convening of mandatory DAC might be adopted.
A two-judge Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice Gulzar Ahmed, a couple of weeks ago, heard a petition filed by Pakistan Hindu Council (PHC) patron Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani, complaining that the apex court’s directives about protection of properties belonging to minority communities were not being implemented. The court ordered the FIA to conduct the inquiry in a month.
Dr Shoaib Suddle, the head of the one-man commission on minorities’ rights, had highlighted the audit report of the AGP. The AGP was also directed to commence the audit of the ETPB accounts afresh and complete the procedure within two months.

7,LHCBA’s mixed reaction to suspension of officers’ conviction,LAHORE: The Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) has come up with a mixed reaction to a decision whereby...,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) has come up with a mixed reaction to a decision whereby conviction of two administrative officers -- Mandi Bahauddin deputy commissioner and assistant commissioner -- was suspended by the Lahore High Court without making them surrender to the law.
The LHCBA finance secretary Faisal Tauqir Sial on Tuesday issued a statement to the media criticising the suspension of the three-month jail term of the bureaucrats by Chief Justice Muhammad Ameer Bhatti. He said a convict could not challenge his/her conviction without surrendering to the law, which meant that the convict was required to first go to jail before filing an appeal against the conviction. He said the DC and AC had misbehaved with the presiding judge of the district consumer court and suspending their conviction without surrender amounted to the court’s disgrace and encouraged the “unbridled bureaucracy”.
Later, LHCBA secretary Mohsin Abbas also issued a statement, disowning the opinion of the finance secretary. Mr Abbas said the bar had nothing to do with Sial’s statement and it should be treated as an “individual’s remark”.
Advocate Burhan Moazzam Malik said the court relied on a 2012 judgment of the Supreme Court while suspending the officer’s conviction without their surrender to the law. He said the apex court in its 2015 judgement had declared the previous (2012) judgment “inapt” saying surrender before a higher court could not be considered as surrender before law without being imprisoned. However, he said, if the high court deemed the 2012 judgement a valid law, then this law should be implemented on all appeals against convictions landing in the court without any discrimination.
Advocate Safdar Shaheen Pirzada supported the LHC decision. He, however, said the district police officer (DPO) committed professional misconduct by not implementing the consumer court’s order.
The LHC CJ on Monday suspended the conviction of Mandi Bahauddin DC Tariq Basra and AC Imtiaz Ali Baig by the consumer court in a contempt case.
District and Sessions Judge Rao Abdul Jabbar Khan had on Nov 26 handed down three-month imprisonment each to both officers and ordered the DPO to shift them to jail.

The main ceremony was held at the Government Boys Comprehensive Higher Secondary School Multan where South Punjab Additional Chief Secretary retired Capt Saqib Zafar administered oath to the elected representatives of schools situated in the urban areas of Multan.
The main ceremony was linked to such ceremonies being held at all 43 tehsils of 11 districts of South Punjab through Zoom.
In their oaths, the elected representatives vowed to forget the bitterness of elections, take their opponents along, assist their teachers and work for welfare of their fellow students wholeheartedly. They also vowed to exhibit exemplary conduct as well as discipline and become role models for others.
Speaking on the occasion, Secretary School Education, South Punjab, Dr Ehtasham Anwar said the initiative was first of its kind in the country.
He added that unlike the student unions where students with political inclinations participated, the criteria for student councils was such as the only hardworking, capable and disciplined students could get elected.
“Furthermore, the entire phenomenon of students councils would operate under a disciplined and controlled environment and a serious violation could lead to even their dissolution.”
Mr Anwar said the elections of student councils had been organised on the pattern of general elections in the country and entailed nomination of the candidates, election campaigns and use of ballots.
“The main objectives of the constitution of student councils have been stated as developing and nurturing leadership skills in the students as well as equipping them with life skills such as management, communication, public relations etc.”
Mr Anwar hoped that the entire exercise would introduce and strengthen democratic values at the grassroots in a country whose record was far from satisfactory.
“The student councils would primarily organise co-curricular and sports activities on the campuses. Moreover, they would carry out two-way communication between the school administration and the students on issues of mutual concern, as and when needed,” he added.
Elections for Students Councils were held early this month in public schools of all districts of South Punjab and students cast their votes to elect office-bearers including presidents, vice presidents, general secretaries and class representatives in 4,756 elementary, high and higher secondary schools.
