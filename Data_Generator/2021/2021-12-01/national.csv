1,Supreme Court grants bail to PTM leader,"Observes that except for framing charges against  petitioner, no evidence yet produced in court","ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Tuesday granted bail to member of the National Assembly from Waziristan and Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM) leader Mohammad Ali Wazir on the principles of consistency when other co-accused have already been released despite facing similar allegations.  
A three-judge SC bench headed by Justice Sardar Tariq Masood had taken up the bail plea of Ali Wazir against the Sindh High Court order rejecting his petition seeking bail after arrest.  
MNA Mohsin Dawar and PTM leader Manzoor Pishteen were present in the courtroom when the case was taken up by the apex court.  
Ali Wazir was arrested on charges of making incendiary speeches against state institutions at a public meeting in Karachi in December last year. The first information report (FIR) against him was lodged at Sohrab Goth police station the same month.  

Observes that except for framing charges against  petitioner, no evidence yet produced in court

His counsel Advocate Salahuddin Khan Gandapur told Dawn that his client was also facing similar cases and, therefore, the acceptance of his bail application did not mean that he would be released any time soon. The SHC had in June this year upheld the Anti-Terrorism Court’s order dismissing the bail plea of Ali Wazir who is facing the allegations of criminal conspiracy, making hate speech, promoting enmity between linguistic groups, disobedience to an order lawfully promulgated by a public servant, criminal intimidation, waging war against the state, terrorism, etc.  
In its order, the apex court said the petitioner (Ali Wazir) had been behind bars for the last one year but except for framing charges against him, no evidence had yet been produced before the court concerned.  
“We have heard counsel for the petitioner and Prosecutor General for Sindh Dr Fiaz Hussain Shah at great length,” the order said, adding that allegations against the petitioner, co-accused Noorullah Tarin, Sher Mohammad and others were that they delivered speeches against the state institutions. However, the stance of the petitioner’s counsel was that the hate speeches were delivered by all of them, but other accused had been granted bail.  
“We have gone through the order of the ATC which indicates that Noorullah Tarin and Sher Mohammad were released on bail,” the Supreme Court observed, adding that the prosecutor general had informed the court that the speech of the petitioner was available on record, but other speeches were not available.  
“The FIR clearly indicates that all the speeches made during the rally were hate speeches and from the record it was difficult to differentiate the speeches. In that eventuality the petitioner is granted bail,” the order said, adding that the petitioner had been behind bars for almost 11 months and in almost one year only the charges had been framed without further proceedings. Thus the petitioner was granted bail subject to deposit of surety bonds of Rs400,000, the order said.  
Justice Tariq Masood, while expressing his surprise, asked if the case at hand related to security and sovereignty of the country, how other co-accused were released on bail, wondering whether the matters with others had been sorted out.  
Without naming the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, the court regretted that the state was releasing people after entering into negotiations as if no laws were applicable in the areas where people were being martyred. Apparently the apex court was not happy when it observed as if the courts were sitting here only to reject bail applications.  
Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhel, a member of the SC bench, wondered whether parliament should not discuss the allegations levelled by Ali Wazir, adding that the grievances highlighted by the member of parliament should have been redressed.  
“Why our own [people] are being turned into strangers?” Justice Mandokhel asked, wondering what would become of him in case his complaints turned to be true. “The treatment being meted out to the petitioner seems discriminatory and reminds us of the dealings with the good Taliban and bad Taliban.”  
When senior counsel Abdul Latif Afridi mentioned some gathering in the tribal area, the court said what to talk of events in Waziristan when in Lahore mob had martyred 15 police officers recently, but the accused were later released by the government. The senior counsel argued that being a member of parliament Ali Wazir enjoyed the constitutional right to free speech and freedom of expression.  
Justice Tariq Masood, however, observed that the court did not distinguish between an ordinary citizen and a member of parliament, adding that all citizens enjoyed similar right to freedom of expression.  
Latif Afridi said Ali Wazir had lost six of his family members during the fight against terrorism and asked why a person whose family members were martyred did not even have the right to raise his voice against discrimination.  
Advocate Gandapur argued that his client was booked for delivering a speech in Pashto language but the case against him was registered on the complaints of a Sindhi man and a Punjabi man who did not even understand Pashto. Though the bench expressed surprise over invoking sections relating to terrorism against the petitioner, it said the court would not give any observation in this regard as it might prejudice the case pending before the trial court against the petitioner.

3,Bilawal terms talks with TTP betrayal of martyrs,"Addressing Peshawar rally, PPP leader says terrorists should face legal action.","PESHAWAR: Pakistan Peoples Party chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has said that dialogue between the government and the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) is betrayal of the blood of martyrs, adding that terrorists involved in heinous crimes should face legal action before talks. 
Addressing a public meeting here on Tuesday, he alleged that the federal government was trying to reintroduce draconian Frontier Crimes Regulation in the erstwhile Fata on the pretext of negotiations with the TTP. He said that the PPP rejected talks with the terrorists. 
The PPP held the public meeting in connection with the party’s 54th foundation day. Observers say that it was an impressive show of power put up by the PPP in Peshawar since the assassination of its chairperson Benazir Bhutto in December 2007. The party’s women wing workers also participated in the event in large numbers. 

Addressing Peshawar rally, PPP leader says terrorists should face legal action

MNA Syed Khurshid Shah, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, parliamentarians and party workers from the four provinces attended the public gathering. The venue was decorated with PPP flags. 
Mr Bhutto-Zardari said that the government did not have the mandate of parliament for holding talks with terrorists. He said that the government was negotiating with the terrorists who had martyred students of the Army Public School, Peshawar, thousands of innocent civilians and personnel of security forces. 
He said that terrorists wanted to impose Shariah in the country and added that terrorists should understand that the country was already ruled under the Islamic constitution.  He paid tribute to the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for defeating terrorists. “Big powers could not resist terrorists in Afghanistan, but the people of KP defeated terrorists,” he said. 
He said that the PPP would not accept negotiations with the TTP without the consent of the parents of martyred students of the APS. 
The government has started talks with the TTP and other militant groups that have declared a so-called ceasefire amid sporadic attacks on security forces. The Afghan government has announced that it is facilitating talks between Islamabad and the militant groups. 
Regretting the video and audio scandals which have recently engulfed the country’s politics, the PPP chairperson hoped that the court would give a verdict to stop recording of phone calls for ever. 
“We are not happy with the surfacing of scandalous audio and video tapes against anyone and we are against such practices,” he said. He cautioned that (Prime Minister) Imran Khan would face the same fate in future. 
Mr Bhutto-Zardari said that the government was trying to introduce electronic voting machine (EVM) in the next general elections to manipulate the results. He termed the EVM “Result Transmission System-2 which was used to rig elections in 2018”. He said that the PPP’s lawyers would challenge the EVM in the court. 
He said that Imran Khan was also trying to deceive overseas Pakistanis in the name of giving them right to vote. He said that instead of direct voting the PPP had proposed separate electoral college for overseas Pakistanis to give them representation in parliament. 
“How is this possible that the vote of a person will be counted in Bannu while he is sitting in New York,” he argued and vowed that his party would expose the PTI’s “rigging plan”.  He alleged that Imran Khan was trying to give NRO to Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav through an act of parliament. He said that the PPP would oppose NRO to Jadhav on the streets and in the court. 
Mr Bhutto-Zardari urged the people of KP to support his party in the next elections. He said that the PPP had never betrayed masses and had always fulfilled its commitments. He said that the PPP was the only party which gave jobs to people, launched Benazir Income Support Programme for destitute women and sent millions of people to the Middle East and other countries. 
“The PPP will give jobs to people and protect their fundamental rights,” he said, adding that “selected government” was trying to usurp political, economic and fundamental rights of the people.  
He said that Imran Khan had vowed that he would prefer to commit suicide instead of getting loan from the International Monetary Fund. “Now policies of the selected prime minister are forcing people to commit suicide because of poverty.”

6,The rise of Maulana,"If Gwadar’s development is not meant to benefit locals first, then it is a step towards derailment of entire development process.","FOLLOWING the announcement of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), like other journalists, I visited Gwadar, the epicentre of CPEC. During my first visit, accompanied by Dawn’s Gwadar correspondent Behram Baloch, I visited different parts of the town. From fishermen to local traders, all of them were apprehensive about their future amid development so much that they seemed in a state of anxiety by the sudden change that they had started witnessing. Like the town, locals had lost their sense of humour, and I found most of them humourless. “They are worried about their future,” Behram Baloch told me in the Komari Ward of Mullah Band adjacent to the port area, when fishermen had shown little interest in discussing their woes with Dawn. “They do not believe discussing their woes with the media can make a difference, now.”

If Gwadar’s development is not meant to benefit locals first, then it is the first step towards derailment of the entire development process

The locals were also disappointed by the government as well as political parties, including nationalist parties, besides the media. The reason is: no one addresses their growing concerns about their issues and the port town they have been inhabiting for centuries. There was no water, electricity, and other facilities available in the port town, nor is it available now. To my astonishment, on one evening, when Behram wanted to drive me to Koh-i-Batil to have a sight of the entire port town from the hilltop, we were stopped despite the press cards we showed to security personnel at a checkpost, because the locals were not allowed to enter the area after sunset. To my further astonishment, Behram, the unflappable journalist I have ever known, became involved in an altercation with one of the guards. Yet we had to return to the motel.
Read: How Gwadar’s CPEC development might leave its people behind
As it is said, politics is a game of chance; it is unexpected. Similarly, it keeps on changing its dynamics. Unexpectedly, a Maulana rises from oblivion, hailing from a remote town in Gwadar called Surbandar. The Maulana, who is a local leader of the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) in the port town, whose name is Hidayat-ur-Rehman, continues to rise as a leader in Gwadar. Local Baloch follow him, not because of his religious or party affiliation, as they believe he discusses their issues in a way no one else has spoken. As one of the locals puts it, he speaks out after our hearts, adding: “He says vociferously and collectively what one thinks he himself needs to have dared say that, but through him, we have got a voice: Gwadar belongs to us first, and we no longer want to be ignored.”
Keeping the recent Gwadar protest in mind, we spoke to Prof Mumtaz Baloch from Balochistan University’s political science department who has written about politics in the province in his thesis, too. Asked as to why the Maulana rose suddenly unlike JI’s performance in electoral politics for the past many years, Prof Baloch pointed out: “Among other things, in politics, one has to address the current question, no matter what background credentials one has got. That is what Maulana Hidayat-ur-Rehman is doing. At the same time, he is filling out the vacuum, which political forces had left vacant for quite some time.”
Over the decades, long before the CPEC, the Gwadar port town has become the centre of Baloch nationalists’ attention, and they have been apprehensive about its fate from day one and that their identity is at stake. Yet their rhetoric has not matched up the recent crowds gathered by the Maulana, who continues to pull more protesters in his crowd over the issue of basic facilities.   
Belonging to the fishermen community, the Maulana tells Dawn his father and grandfather were fishermen, while he himself was associated with the Islami Jamiat-i-Talaba, a students’ wing of the JI, and later on, with the JI. Asked about his sudden rise as a leader of the people of Gwadar, he says he has been involved in political activities of Gwadar since 2003. “I have also contested election for the provincial and national assembly seats, but I could not win,” he shared with Dawn, continuing, “My struggle is for Gwadar and Makran division, and I have been struggling in this regard for quite some time now under the guidance of my party leadership.”
One of his demands accepted in recent days was a ban on wine stores in Gwadar, lending strength to the rumours that the Maulana wants to push JI’s agenda in a place known to be among the most liberal areas of the province.
Similarly, some are apprehensive that Maulana’s political manoeuvrings are meant to pave the way for religious groups, particularly for the JI. However, the Maulana refutes all the claims, asserting: “Politics is meant [for] the service of human beings. So we are doing politics to serve the people and society, nor am I using my people and society for my own and my party’s vested interests. Having kept the issues of my people in my view, I am doing politics solely to represent them and become their voice in the face of injustice to them. 
“There are two main demands in our protest: first, our respect; second, joblessness. Our source of livelihood and employment in the name of security, via fishing, trade, and other businesses have become ruined. In a nutshell, we want our very own employment that has been snatched from us in the wake of development and security, not the one from you to be given to us.”

In case of Gwadar, it is high time the government listen to the demands for the betterment of locals. If the area development is not meant to benefit the locals first, then it is the first step towards derailment of the entire development process. That is what has not been realised to this day, as our planning has always been executed through short-term, security-centric approaches in a province that makes almost half of the country. Same is happening in Gwadar ever since it has come into the limelight.

Speaking at a press conference along with Young Nurses Association president Malik Aziz Kakar on Tuesday, YDA president Dr Hafeez Mandokhail said Balochistan was already facing a shortage of nurses. He said the association had given the government 48 hours to meet their demands, but no headway was made and still 19 doctors and other people were in police lockup and cases against them were not withdrawn. 
“Our sit-in should not be considered as silence. We talk about reforms in the health sector. We are not against the esteemed court. When the chief minister fell ill, he left for Karachi. We have boycotted emergency services. The government is being given another respite,” Dr Mandokhail said. 
He said the YDA planned to take out a rally on Wednesday and after that emergency services would be closed if demands were not met. “The government is being given another respite at the behest of political and social organisations. Fixing mach­ines in hospitals is not our responsibility. Our movement is for the people. Let the people support us,” he added.

The infuriated young men threw stones at the Fauji Towers, the building named in the fake ad, causing damage to its windowpanes. 
According to eyewitnesses, a large number of young people began congregating outside the facility at around 12.30pm, apparently awaiting their interview calls for the recruitment in Bahrain police. However, as time went by and their number grew, they started to get furious amid no response from the supposed employer. 
It all started when some individuals placed ads on social media asking interested candidates to visit the Fauji Tower on Tuesday for the selection and final interview to get a job in the Bahrain police. 
The social media’s message caught the attention of the candidates from different parts of the country, who gathered outside the building.
