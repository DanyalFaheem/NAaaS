ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Tuesday regretted that commercial use of cantonment lands was a matter of ‘embarrassment’ for both the judiciary and the military establishment.
Headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Gulzar Ahmed, a three-judge Supreme Court bench that had taken up a case relating to the illegal use of cantonment board lands in Karachi observed that the lands acquired for strategic purposes had to be surrendered back to the state the moment the lands were used for commercial gains other than the defence purposes.
“I wonder why the army has to venture into these projects,” observed Justice Qazi Mohammad Amin Ahmed, also a member of the SC bench.
Managing cinema halls, wedding halls or huge shopping malls, petrol pumps or housing societies on military lands was not legally sustainable as those lands were not meant for commercial activities, the court noted.
This state of affairs was happening across the country on all the cantonment lands, the chief justice regretted, also highlighting that three bases meant for the air force in Karachi were being used for commercial activities besides wedding halls and hotels had been developed at the naval base on Sharea Faisal, Karachi. Even the Canteen Stores Department (CSD) – a subsidiary of the defence forces – were turned into open commercial department stores while a huge building was constructed on Gizri Road Karachi within the span of a few days, the court regretted.
While pointing towards Defence Secretary Lt Gen (retd) Mian Mohammad Hilal Hussain, the chief justice observed that having served in the army on a senior position, the secretary must know that commercial use of the cantonment lands was not the intent of the relevant laws.
The secretary, however, withdrew a report furnished before the court when the bench rejected it with the remarks that the report seemed to be incorrect as the buildings mentioned to have been razed were still standing there.
While pointing towards Attorney General Khalid Jawed Khan, the court wondered how the defence ministry could justify its use for the strategic purposes and asked the government to provide a comprehensive report highlighting which land of the cantonments was used for commercial purposes.
The AG, however, stated a joint committee of the three services had been set up to identify such violations, also assuring the court that a fresh report would soon be furnished before the court. The defence secretary also volunteered to personally visit the sites to file the fresh report along with pictures within four weeks.
What action the court would take against other violations if such a state of affairs in the military lands was allowed to continue, the Supreme Court observed, regretting that the army officials purchased such lands and then sold it to others. Later, the same plot was purchased by a number of individuals to build houses worth several millions.
One would find palatial buildings and huge marriage halls on the military lands even in Lahore, the chief justice observed, questioning again how wedding halls could be built on such lands.
The defence secretary, however, tried to explain that the definition of the strategic use for defence purposes had a wide connotation that also included commercial purposes, arguing that it was essential to keep the morale of the defence forces high during peace time.
“But where the garrison is located on such lands,” wondered the chief justice, adding that one would find only houses on such lands.

1,Cabinet rejects audit report on Covid-19 spending,Fawad says election funding may be linked to use of EVMs; PM prohibits cabinet members from travelling abroad to ensure austerity.,"• Minister says funding of elections may be linked to use of EVMs
• Sindh blamed for high price of commodities
• Leaked ex-CJP audio termed conspiracy
• Fawad says gas reserves depleting     
ISLAMABAD: The federal cabinet on Tuesday rejected the recently-released audit report which hinted at billions of rupees of irregularities in Covid-19 expenditure, vaccination process and Ehsaas relief programme.
The cabinet meeting presided over by Prime Minister Imran Khan also asserted that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) was bound to hold the next general elections on the basis of electronic voting machines (EVMs) in line with the recent legislation carried out by the parliament.
The cabinet expressed its satisfaction over the ‘reduction’ in prices of food items by 0.67 per cent while media reported that according to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), inflation had risen to over 11pc in November.
On the issue of retired Justice Rana Shamim, the cabinet believed that a conspiracy had been hatched against former Supreme Court chief justice Saqib Nisar by ex-prime minister Nawaz Sharif.       
Prime Minister Khan also prohibited cabinet members from travelling abroad to ensure austerity.   
“The cabinet rejected the audit report on Covid-19 spending and asked three relevant organisations to give their presentations in this regard,” Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said in a press conference after the cabinet meeting.
The report on “expenditures incurred on Covid-19 by federal government” released by the finance ministry had pointed out irregularities in government interventions to ensure availability of five essential items — sugar, wheat flour, oil and ghee, pulses and rice — in Utility Stores at subsidised rates. 
Mr Chaudhry said the finance ministry had already rejected the audit report and Ehsaas programme in charge and PM’s aide Dr Sania Nishtar had also clarified the position of her organisation.   
About the use of EVM in the elections, he said: “The cabinet was of the view that following legislation on electoral reforms, the ECP was bound to hold the next general election [in 2023] through EVM.”
He said the cabinet expressed reservations about videos circulating on social media which showed votes being bought for the upcoming by-poll in Lahore. 
“Such illegal activities would not have come to the fore if steps had been taken by the ECP against horse trading in the recent Senate election,” he added.
Free and fair polls were a lifeline for a democratic system and were the basis for formation of a government, he said, urging the ECP to take the matter of vote purchase by specific political parties in Lahore to a logical conclusion.
“If elections are not conducted through EVMs, the government might not be able to fund them,” he said, adding that the existing laws only gave legitimacy to polls held via the EVMs.
He said Law Minister Dr Mohammad Farogh Naseem was of the view that on prima facie, the government could only give funds to the ECP for elections held through EVMs.
The government had formed a committee in this regard and the law ministry would give its opinion on the matter, he added.
The minister said the Election Commission should ensure the use of EVMs in the next elections as the Parliament had given a mandate in this regard.
Speaking about former judge of Gilgit-Baltistan, the information minister said during hearing on the matter on Tuesday, retired Justice Shamim told the court that he had not yet examined the affidavit attributed to him.
When asked whether he had given it to a newspaper, the former judge had responded in the court, “My affidavit is sealed in a locker in the UK. I don’t know how it was leaked.”
Terming the development “surprising”, Mr Chaudhry said if the affidavit was in a locker how did it reach the newspaper that initially reported it, adding that “it seems that the affidavit reached the newspaper through Nawaz Sharif”.
“A campaign has been launched against the judiciary and armed forces and we hope that the court would take the matter to its logical conclusion,” he added.
According to media report, Justice Shamim revealed in an alleged affidavit that he had witnessed Saqib Nisar relaying instructions to a high court judge not to release former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz in corruption references.
Prices of commodities
Federal Minister Chaudhry claimed that except for tea, Pakistan had the cheapest prices of all other kitchen commodities in the region, comprising India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.
“We are doing whatever we can in these times of global inflation,” he remarked.
The minister also announced that a bumper rice crop was expected this year with a harvest of nine million tonnes.
He said in just a month’s period, the cost of sugar had come down to Rs60 per kg, blaming the Sindh government for the increase in price.
“Inflation is rampant in the cities like Karachi and Hyderabad. The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government is being portrayed as inexperienced whereas the party that has been governing the province for over 30 years has failed to check food inflation,” he added.
The 40pc upward trend in the Sensitive Price Index (SPI) was due to inflation in Karachi and Sindh, the minister said, adding that the price of tomato had registered 15.4pc decrease, onion, 7.4pc and the cost of chicken had fallen by 6.6pc. The price of a bag of wheat flour had reduced by 1pc, he added.
The minister said in Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Lahore, Multan and Faisalabad, a flour bag was available for Rs1,100 whereas in Karachi, it was priced at Rs1,404 and Rs1,443 in Hyderabad due to bad governance of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) government.
He said similarly, in the international market, a sack of urea was available for Rs10,500 per bag while in Punjab, it could be bought for Rs1,700.
Gas shortage
Talking about gas, of which the country was seeing shortage with the onset of winter, the minister warned that gas reserves in the country were depleting.
“And we have not discovered any new resources,” he said, highlighting the need for a strategy to address the issue of disappearing indigenous reserves of gas and the emerging shortfall of the commodity.
He said only 28pc Pakistanis were actually being supplied gas, while “the rest of the country, deprived of the commodity’s supply, facilitated this small percentage”.
It has been learnt that PM Khan has barred cabinet members from travelling abroad to ensure austerity and urged them to work more vigorously in their respective ministry to tackle economic challenges in the country.  
However, talking to Dawn, Fawad Chaudhry said the prime minister had not issued such instructions for any specific reason, but had been urging cabinet members in almost all meetings to adopt austerity measures and avoid unnecessary foreign trips.  
He said the cabinet had also expressed concern over the possible spread of the new Covid-19 variant, Omicron, and asked provincial governments and citizens to ensure that inoculation was complete.
“The virus is surely going to reach the country, therefore wearing masks was necessary,” he emphasised.
Sharing other developments from the cabinet meeting, Mr Chaudhry said formalities had been completed to receive $3 billion in safe deposits and $1.2bn worth of oil supplies on deferred payments from Saudi Arabia.
The meeting had also given approval to limit construction of buildings around airports and tasked Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam to formulate a long-term policy on smog in Lahore.
The minister said the Federal Investigation Agency had also been asked to launch a programme against human trafficking. 
Pakistan would also be sending 50,000 tonnes of wheat to Kabul and hosting an extraordinary meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation’s Council of Foreign Ministers to discuss the situation in Afghanistan, he added.

2,"November inflation hits 11.5pc, highest in 20 months","Prices of fresh vegetables, fruits and meat have posted a persistent increase in major urban and rural centres.","ISLAMABAD: An upward swing in consumer prices continued in November as inflation edged up to 11.5 per cent from 9.2pc, the highest increase noted in the past 20 months influenced by a record hike in fuel prices last month, the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) data showed on Tuesday.
The massive rupee depreciation fuelled import-led inflation. Inflation measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased to its highest level in 20 months — the period when global oil prices kept rising steadily undermining earlier gains.
At the same time, prices of fresh vegetables, fruits and meat have also posted a persistent increase in major urban and rural centres.
The average inflation during the July-November period rose to 9.32pc on a yearly basis. 
Inflation had started declining after surging to 12.4pc in February 2020, mainly driven by a drop in prices of agricultural products. The trend is reversing now on the back of a rise in prices of petroleum products.
In 2020-21, annual CPI inflation was recorded at 8.90pc against 10.74pc the preceding year.
The monthly outlook report of finance ministry shows Pakistan’s inflation rate is driven by demand factors, international commodity prices, exchange rate, seasonal factors and economic agents’ expectations concerning the future developments of these indicators.
Year-on-year (YoY) inflation is marginally increased in the last two months. Going forward, this increase in inflation may be tempered by the seasonal profile whose contribution was positive in October but is usually about neutral in November.
Besides government policy, administrative and relief measures may support to ease out the inflationary pressures. 
However, the prices of crude oil along with all other energy inputs are on the rise due to increasing global demand in post-Covid scenarios. Also, a rise in freight charges have made international trade costlier and caused a hike in global inflation. The international price of crude oil rose by 106.7pc on a YoY basis.
Currently, the government aims to increase agriculture productivity for food security and self-sufficiency to counter food inflation by offering Agri-loans. 
While the finance division in its recent report claimed that taking into account new price impulses in November and the low base effect, inflation would remain between 8.5 and 9.5 per cent, but the November inflation has already surpassed the projected figure.
Food inflation is still at a higher level as in urban areas it jumped by 11.9pc in November on a yearly basis and 3.9pc on a monthly basis, whereas the respective growth in prices in rural areas was 8.6pc and 3.3pc.
According to a finance division report, food prices have risen globally due to shortage of supply of commodities and high demand. Pakistan has also been affected, as the country is a net importer of food items especially wheat, sugar, pulses, and edible oil.
The report says the government has already announced Rs120 billion package, jointly funded by the federal and provincial governments, to provide a 30pc discount on ghee, flour and pulses to 130 million less privileged people.
The PBS data showed that in urban areas, food items, which saw an increase in their prices in November as compared to the previous month, included tomatoes 131.64pc, mustard oil 11.6pc, vegetable ghee 10.87pc, vegetables 10.47pc, eggs 10.19pc, cooking oil 9.71pc, potatoes 8.85pc, honey 5.61pc, fruits 4.37pc, pulse masoor 3.14pc, meat 2.63pc, milk 2.33pc, fish 1.90pc, gram whole 1.77pc, rice 1.73pc and sugar 1.43pc.
In urban areas, the prices of onions declined by 7.97pc, chicken by 4.34pc, and pulse moong 0.69pc. 
Overall, a similar trend in food prices was noted in rural areas.
Non-food inflation in urban centres increased by 12pc on a YoY and 2pc on a month-on-month basis, whereas in rural areas it rose by 13pc and 3pc, respectively. The increase in non-food inflation was mainly driven by a hefty rise in oil prices in November.
Core inflation in urban areas was 7.6pc in November as against 6.7pc the previous month. In rural areas, the corresponding increase was 8.2pc as against 6.7pc.
The State Bank determines the key policy rate — currently at 8.75pc — based on the core inflation rate.
Average inflation measured by the Sensitive Price Index edged up to 18.1pc in November from 15.2pc a month earlier, while the Wholesale Price Index surged to 27pc during the month under review from 21.2pc.

3,Top medical body cancels contract of MDCAT examination service firm,PMA general secretary terms PMC's decision an attempt at damage control.,"ISLAMABAD: In a surprise move, the Pakistan Medical Commission (PMC) has cancelled the joint venture agreement with a company which in September held Medical and Dental Colleges Admission Tests (MDCAT) of around 200,000 candidates and through advertisement has invited bids for procurement of computer-based examination service.  
However, Aamir Masood, the representative of SOAR Testing and Evaluation Plat­form (SMC-private) Limi­ted, which had won the bid for online MDCAT tests for 10 years, said the PMC had not informed the company about cancellation of the agreement and he had learnt it through the advertisement.  
On the other hand, Pakis­tan Medical Associa­tion’s (PMA) General Secretary for Punjab Dr Malik Shahid said that it was an attempt at damage control as during hearings of cases in Lahore and Islamabad high courts it was proved that the company was hired against the rules.  
Meanwhile, the National Assembly Standing Committee on Health has called the PMC for a briefing on the MDCAT on Wednesday (today).  
The MDCAT is a mandatory test for admission to medical and dental colleges. Computer-based tests were held in Sept in 22 cities across Pakistan and six foreign locations. However, students and medical fraternity criticised the exams as the company, which had won the bid for online MDCAT tests and conducted them, was registered with the Security Exchange Commission of Pakistan after due date of filing bids in May this year. Besides, the PMC has been facing allegations that it released advance payment of over Rs115 million to the company.  
Later the Lahore High Court (LHC) on Aug 17 stopped the PMC from paying further funds to the company but the PMC again paid Rs86m to the company on Aug 31. Moreover, the LHC referred the matter to the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) to investigate whether the contract was awarded to the company against the rules.   
It was also alleged that the company (SOAR) lacked the National Tax Number (NTN) and it used another company’s NTN to get the contract.  
The report of the PPRA, available with Dawn, stated that the award of contract to private company was in violation of rules. It also declared, against the stance of PMC, that the amount received from candidates was public fund.  
In a latest development, PMC through advertisement invited bids for procurement of computer-based examination services, including operational system. The advertisement says bidders should have NTN and Sales Tax Number and should be on active tax payer list of the Federal Board of Revenue. Companies have been asked to submit bids before Dec 9.  
Dr Shahid Malik, while talking to Dawn, said that Islamabad and Lahore high courts were approached by the PMA and other stakeholders and told that the testing company was hired in violation of rules.  
“There was another blunder that an agreement of 10 years was signed with the company. Later during hearings of the case it was proved in the court that the agreement was in violation of rules. So the PMC has cancelled the contract in an attempt of damage control,” he said.  
Asked if the company will demand damages as the 10-year agreement was cancelled without intimation, representative of the company Aamir Masood said he could not say it at the moment and such a decision could be made after seeking legal opinion.  
There exists no finding by any judicial or statutory forum that the agreement was anything but appropriately executed.  
“PPRA in its finding referred to the procurement representing an emergency procurement in addition to there being only one provider. In view of this observation, it was considered appropriate that since an emergency procurement is meant to cater to an immediate event or short term, … the agreement between PMC and company be mutually terminated. Hence on the Authority’s recommendation, the Council approved the mutual termination of the JV Agreement and directed a public tender to allow all entities capable of providing the facilities required for holding future examinations to submit their proposals and bids,” a statement issued by the PMC said.  
“The decision represents the Commission’s established policy of transparency. It further does not in manner raise a concern on the technical conduct of the exams held up till now which were held transparently and properly in all respects,” the PMC said.  
The National Accountability Bureau has been also looking into the issue and has directed the PMC to provide details and documents related to award of the contract.  
A faculty member of a medical college, requesting not to be named, said the PMC was again going to make a blunder as it was the job of universities to hold the MDCAT rather than the PMC which was a regulator.  
Meanwhile the PMC on Tuesday told the LHC that it had cancelled the contract with the private company that was earlier engaged for holding MDCAT.  
Justice Muzamil Akhtar Shabbir was hearing a petition challenging the contract and subsequent payment made to the company, despite a stay order.  
The counsel for the PMC also told the court that an advertisement had been published to invite bids from companies in accordance with the public procurement rules.  
The lawyer of the petitioner contended that the court had restrained the PMC from making further payments to the company from registration fee collected from the candidates.  
The counsel argued that the PMC had committed contempt of court and the act was liable to be punished under the law.  
He said the PMC had granted the contract to the company in violation of the procurement rules.  
The judge adjourned hearing till Dec 6 for further arguments.

4,IHC asks GB’s ex-judge to file actual affidavit,Affidavit reported by media accuses ex-CJP Nisar of causing delay in release of Nawaz,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday directed the former chief judge of Gilgit-Baltistan (GB), Rana Shamim, to submit the original affidavit that accused an ex-chief justice of Pakistan of causing delay in release of ex-premier Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz.
IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah was hearing a contempt proceeding against former chief judge Shamim, journalist Ansar Abbasi, the resident editor and the editor-in-chief of the newspaper that published a story about the affidavit.
The court warned: “In case the original document/ affidavit, on the basis of which the news report was published, is not produced before this court on the date fixed then it would raise a presumption of its non-existence.”
When the court inquired him about the authenticity of the affidavit published in the newspaper, Mr Shamim replied that he neither read the news item nor remembered the contents of the affidavit since after signing it, he kept the same in a locker with his family residing in the UK.
Attorney General Khalid Jawed Khan quipped that Mr Shamim remembered each and every detail of ex-CJP Saqib Nisar’s visit to GB of 2018 but forget what he had stated on oath on November 10.

Affidavit reported by media accuses ex-CJP Nisar of causing delay in release of Nawaz

In the November 10, 2021 affidavit, Mr Shamim allegedly stated that the ex-CJP during his visit to GB made a call to an IHC judge and asked him to ensure that Mr Sharif and his daughter are not released on bail before July 25, 2018 general elections.
The IHC chief justice noted that the said affidavit cast serious aspersion on the judiciary and was an attempt to erode public confidence in the institution.
In reply to the court’s queries, Mr Shamim said his response was obtained by The News International after publication of the news report. He stated he had not provided any document’s copy, as the document executed by him was sealed and kept in a locker in the UK.
According to Mr Shamim, the key of the locker was in possession of his grandson.
Justice Minallah noted that Mr Shamim was not sure regarding the contents of the purported affidavit or document, as the case may be. Mr Shamim then claimed the document/affidavit kept sealed in a locker was not shared with anyone.
The court directed the ex-chief judge to submit his written reply within four days along with the original document/affidavit that he claimed was sealed and kept in a locker in the UK.
The attorney general was directed to coordinate with Mr Shamim to facilitate delivery of the document/affidavit from the UK, while the foreign secretary and Pakistan High Commission in the UK were asked to assist the attorney general in this regard.
The AG was of the opinion that the onus was on the ex-chief judge as publication of the ‘same’ was not a crime and subsequently he suggested that contempt proceedings against the journalist and newspaper’s management might be deferred.
However, Advocate Faisal Siddiqui, amicus curiae in this matter, said that keeping an affidavit in locker was not contemptuous but the contemnor was the publisher who had brought this in public knowledge.
The court asked the registrar office to provide copies of the response of the amici curiae to all the alleged contemnors and adjourned further proceeding till December 7.
