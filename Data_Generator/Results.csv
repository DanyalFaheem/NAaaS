2022-12-22,2022-12-23,Rice exporters seek cheap energy,ISLAMABAD: Expo­rters on Thursday asked the federal government to allow a subsidised power tariff of Rs19.99 and an...,"ISLAMABAD: Expo­rters on Thursday asked the federal government to allow a subsidised power tariff of Rs19.99 and an uninterrupted gas supply to rice mills to arrest the declining trend in export.
Pakistan’s rice ex­­ports dipped by 9.33 per cent to $749.40 million in July-November this year from $826.50m in the corresponding months of last year.
During a meeting with Commerce Secre­tary Muhammad Sualeh Ahmad Faruqui,  Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan (Reap) Presi­dent Chela Ram Kew­lani warned that the export proceeds would fall below last year’s $2.5 billion if measures were not taken immediately.
He said that rice exports had the potential to reach $5bn in a couple of years if the sector gets the government’s facilitation.
Mr Kewlani said that Finance Minister Ishaq Dar’s claims of supporting exports remain on paper for sectors like rice. 
He alleged that the minister only facilitates big industries and has no soft corner for the rice sector. 
“We are not demanding subsidy for exports,” he said, adding finance minister or commerce minister has no time to listen to the problems of Pakistan’s second biggest commodity export sector.
Mr Kewlani said various issues including the declaration of industry status for the rice sector, subsidised tariff rates for rice mills and other matters related to rice export trade were discussed with the commerce secretary.
He deplored that Rs12bn under the Export Development Fund (EDF) was stuck with the government. 
“We dem­a­­nd the government to spend this amount on the rice growers to improve seeds and cultivation to increase yield,” he said. 
Addressing a press conference at National Press Club after the meeting, Mr Kewlani said containers were piling up at ports as businessmen were unable to open letters of credit due to shortage of dollars.
“The national economy is paying the price of persistent political instability,” he deplored.

2022-12-22,2022-12-23,Nano-loan apps deceiving users: CCP,CCP finds that several mobile apps offering nano loans indulge in deceptive marketing and collect users’ personal data.,"ISLAMABAD: The Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) has found that several mobile apps offering nano loans don’t fulfil legal requirements, indulge in deceptive marketing and collect users’ personal data.
In a statement issued on Thursday, the commission said it had taken notice of the “various emerging concerns regarding mobile applications on Google Play Store offering nano/micro personal loans to vulnerable customers”, mostly belonging to the lower to middle-income class.
The CCP — mandated to protect consumers from anti-competitive practices, including deceptive marketing — said it conducted a preliminary investigation after reports appeared in the media about the practice found that several mobile apps were offering nano-loans without fulfilling the legal requirements of Non-Banking Micro Finance Companies’ (NBMFCs) law.
The NBMFC law offers a framework to regulate nano-loans only above Rs10,000, whereas most of these apps were offering smaller loans, it said, adding that these applications had more than 10 million downloads.
Its preliminary findings revealed, among other things, that these mobile apps had “contradictions between interest rate and processing fees charged from the borrowers versus the rates advertised”.
“There are also instances of faulty claims of data privacy and security, collecting personal data on the pretext of offering loans, the discrepancy in repayments, and the credit range advertised vis-a-vis those actually offered,” it said.
Based on the preliminary findings, the inquiry committee is authorised to thoroughly probe and submit an inquiry report to the commission with respect to any or all possible contraventions under the act against all nano-loan apps.
