2022-03-19,2022-03-20,Acquittal of Qandeel Baloch’s brother challenged in apex court,State appeal says the acquittal of the convict in the case is a miscarriage of justice.,"LAHORE: The Punjab prosecution department on Saturday filed a state appeal before the Supreme Court’s Lahore registry, challenging the acquittal of the sole convict in the murder case of social media sensation Qandeel Baloch.
The Lahore High Court’s Multan bench had on Feb 14 acquitted Mohammad Waseem, the brother of Qandeel, of the charges, setting aside his life imprisonment handed down by a trial court in 2019 under Section 311 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
The state appeal filed by Additional Prosecutor General Khurram Khan argues that the LHC did not appreciate the law and the facts of the case in its true perspective while allowing the appeal of the convict.
It says the acquittal of the convict in the case is a miscarriage of justice.
The appeal argues that the confessional statement of the convict under Section 164 CrPC was quite convincing, but the LHC discarded it on the basis of mere technicalities and assumptions.
It states that the observations made by the court in the impugned judgement with respect to the confession are against the law of the land and not sustainable in the eye of law.
The appeal contends that in this era of scientific evidence, the bench ignored the matching DNA reports of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) which establish the case of the prosecution from all corners.
It says the death of Qandeel occurred in the house of her parents and according to Section 122 of the Qanoon-i-Shahadat Order, 1984, the burden is shifted on the accused to establish his non-involvement in the crime.
It argues that the reports of the items of DNA collected from near the body of the deceased confirmed the presence of the convict on the crime scene and his involvement in the murder of his sister.
The appeal argues that a bare perusal of the evidence produced in the court and circumstances of the case make it a classic case of “honour killing” which falls within the ambit of Section 311 PPC (Fasad-fil-Arz).
It further argues that the appellate court did not consider the polygraph test which was very strong evidence against the accused.
The prosecution states that the LHC acted against the law by acquitting the convict on the basis of compromise without summoning the list of legal heirs of the deceased.
It says the deceased had a minor son and the court, while allowing the appeal of the convict, did not safeguard the rights of the minor in the case.
The appeal asks the apex court to set aside the judgement of the LHC and restore the sentence of the convict awarded by the trial court.
Justice Sohail Nasir of the LHC had allowed the appeal of Waseem after finding grave illegalities made by the judicial magistrate concerned while recording the judicial confession.
The judge, in his judgement, observed, “Once the evidence of confession is discarded, there is no other material at all with the prosecution to establish that it was a case of honour killing”.
The judge observed, “I am conscious of the fact that a famous celebrity of the country lost her life without any sin but this fact alone is not relevant to sustain the conviction of appellant for the reasons that the courts have to decide cases in accordance with law”.

2022-03-19,2022-03-20,Ready to give dissidents ‘benefit of doubt’: PM,Calls on PTI workers to hold peaceful demonstrations; questions need to call Sindh police for Sindh House protection...,"RAWALPINDI: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday expressed the confidence that public pressure would force the dissident Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) parliamentarians back into the party fold.
“I will give them (dissident lawmakers) a benefit of doubt; PTI leaders are talking to them and they will return under public pressure,” PM Khan said while addressing the ground-breaking ceremony of the Rawalpindi Ring Road project.
“At the time of ‘Changa Manga’ politics, there was no social media. Now, times have changed and social media has brought things out in the open,” he said.
The prime minister said the PTI would stage a historic public meeting in Islamabad on March 27.
“People will gather on one point and that is to stand on the side of the righteous,” he added.

Calls on PTI workers to hold peaceful demonstrations; questions need to call Sindh police for Sindh House protection

“A market had been set up in Sindh House to buy the conscience of lawmakers,” he said, claiming that looted money as well as funds from the Sindh government were being used to purchase votes for the no-trust move.
“The Sindh government’s money is public money. It is illegal to spend that money to buy politicians’ conscience,” PM Khan said, adding that, “why had the Sindh police been called to the Sindh House for its protection; what was the fear?”
He said if some PTI members had grievances and wanted to leave, why did they require police protection?
Prime Minister Khan said the no-trust move was a blessing of God as it would enable people to see for themselves the political system in the country.
“Buying off people, looting the country and then sending the ill-gotten wealth abroad; is this a democratic system,” he said.
Giving example of the United Kingdom, PM Khan said: “We were following a democratic system based on the Westminster model where no one would dare to even think of floor-crossing for financial purposes.”
Talking about the PTI workers who stormed the Sindh House, Mr Khan said they had become emotional, however, 
peaceful protest was everyone’s right.
The prime minister advised party workers to hold peaceful demonstrations and avoid confrontation with people from the opposition parties.
Earlier, while congratulating the residents of Rawalpindi, PM Khan said the Ring Road project would bring a good change in the region and ensure vast connectivity, save travel time and improve business activities.
He said Lahore Ring Road had already brought huge changes and stressed upon undertaking similar projects in other cities of Punjab.
He said unchecked expansion of mega cities had been creating problems, from availability of cultivable land, provision of safe drinking water to proper waste disposal system.
The prime minister said he had directed the chief secretaries and the commissioner of Islamabad to prepare master plans for big cities which would be submitted shortly.
“Due to unplanned expansion of cities, land had shrunk for cultivating crops and green areas,” he said, adding that ring roads around big cities would act as buffer zones against growth of settlements.
About the Leh Nullah project, Mr Khan announced that it would be launched in the next three weeks.
“The project will rejuvenate Rawalpindi by transforming it into a modern city,” he added.
He said the government had also planned industrial zones along Ring Road.
Accepting Aviation Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan’s proposal, the prime minister said Ring Road would be connected with Islamabad via Sangjani.
Speaking on the occasion, Punjab Chief Minister Sardar Usman Buzdar said the project was being executed by the PTI government and it would have all facilities.
Studies were being conducted for setting up ring roads in Faisalabad, Multan and Sialkot, Mr Buzdar said, adding that work on these projects would start soon.
He said work was underway on 822 development schemes worth Rs195 billion, out of which 55pc were complete.
Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed lashed out at political opponents, calling them corrupt, looters and absconders.
He said he was optimistic that Imran Khan would come out successful during voting on the no-confidence motion.
He requested the prime minister to direct early completion of Leh Nullah Expressway project for the benefit of the population of the garrison city.
Aviation Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan said the PTI government was completing ‘this project as a gift’ to the people of Rawalpindi and Islamabad.
“The Rawalpindi Ring Road project will soon become a major artery of the entire country,” he added.

2022-03-19,2022-03-20,SC asks both sides to help with no-trust matter,Reference under Article 63-A to be taken up alongside SCBA plea.,"ISLAMABAD: The Sup­reme Court on Saturday sought assistance from six political parties including the proponents of the no-trust motion in the National Assembly against Prime Minister Imran Khan and ordered the Islamabad police chief to come up with a comprehensive report regarding Friday’s breaching of Sindh House by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) activists. 
In an unusual sitting, a two-judge SC bench comprising Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial and Justice Muneeb Akhtar issued notices to the ruling PTI, Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (Fazl), Balochistan National Party (Mengal) and the Awami National Party through their respective secretary generals, though they will be represented by their legal counsel. 
The court also issued notices to the respondents for their assistance in ensuring a smooth, lawful and peaceful completion of the process under Article 95 of the constitution. 
The federal government through interior and defence secretaries, the prime minister, leader of the opposition in the National Assembly, National Assembly speaker and secretary, Islamabad chief commissioner and deputy commissioner and Inspector General of Police are respondents in the case. 

Reference under Article 63-A to be taken up alongside SCBA plea

Earlier, the case was fixed for Monday, March 21. But the court preferred to take up the matter on Saturday — a day when usually benches don’t sit to hear cases, though former CJP Saqib Nisar used to hear cases on weekends too. 
CJP Bandial emphasised that political activities should be held within the confines of the law and the Constitution instead of creating ‘anarchic’ situation. Hurling threats to state institutions or damaging public properties was not acceptable, he observed. 
Referring to Article 95 of the Constitution, which deals with the no-confidence motion, the SC described it as a non-legal matter that did not relate to the jurisdiction of the apex court.
“With respect to the proceedings under Article 95 being conducted in accordance with the Constitution and the law, except the incident of the Friday last — when a group of charged PTI activists breached the Sindh House twice — presently there is nothing before us that invites our attention either in the public interest or on account of the violation of the constitutional principles,” the CJP remarked while dictating the orders after the hearing. 
The Supreme Court had taken up a petition moved by the Supreme Court Bar Association – an apex legal forum – instituted to seek a restraining order against government’s “intentions” of preventing the parliamentarians from taking part in the no-trust motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan. 
Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Khalid Jawed Khan, Additional Interior Secretary Mohammad Ayub, IGP Ahsan Younus, Additional Advocate General for Sindh Rafiq Rajorvi were present in the courtroom No 1. 
While pointing towards senior counsel for SCBA Mansoor Usman Awan, the bench explained that the SC was hearing the petition of the bar and did not take any suo motu notice on the matter. Mr Awan sought a direction from the apex court to all the state functionaries to act strictly in accordance with the Constitution and the law by restraining them from acting in any manner detrimental to and unwarranted by the Constitution and the law. 
Reference under Article 63-A
Also, the attorney general apprised the apex court that the federal government was filing a reference under Article 186 of the Constitution, seeking delineation of the scope and meaning of certain provisions contained in Article 63-A of the Constitution. 
The CJP, however, observed that the court would take up matter only when it came before the court, but regretted whatever happened on Friday was “beyond the right of freedom of expression and lawful protest”. 
The AGP also tried to explain factors behind the violent protest, recalled how some lawmakers had been “placed” at Sindh House, and alleged that this reflected a return to the old menace of horse trading.  
The bench, however, observed that the SCBA had approached the court in aid of public interest to assure that the rights of the parliamentarians were exercised in accordance with the Constitution and the law. 
The AGP then assured the court about federal government’s commitment to the process under Article 95 of the Constitution to be followed strictly in accordance with the law. He expressed deep regret on behalf of the federal government about the events that took place on Friday evening and affirmed government’s resolve for the law to take its course with respect to the offences that were committed during the incident. 
The court then postponed further proceedings for Monday with the observation that if any reference was filed, it would also be taken along with the SCBA plea.

2022-03-18,2022-03-20,Ties with Islamabad through diplomatic channels: US,"When asked about Biden-Imran phone call, White House says it has no knowledge of that.","

JEN Psaki

 
WASHINGTON: The Biden administration has indicated its desire to continue a careful engagement with Pakistan without committing to either improving or degrading ties with a country that was once a close ally.
The indication came at a Friday afternoon news briefing at the White House when Press Secretary Jen Psaki ignored two provocative questions that she could have used to either criticise Pakistan’s current policies or to underline the US desire to repair ties with Islamabad.
A Pakistani journalist reminded her that many, many months ago Prime Minister Imran Khan had “requested a telephone conversation” with US President Joe Biden. “We haven’t heard anything about that. Is there a specific reason for not communicating with the Pakistani leadership?” the journalist asked.
“I don’t have any update on a planned call or engagement. Obviously, we engage with Pakistan and a range of leaders at a number of levels through the State Department, through our national security team,” the White House press secretary replied. “But in terms of a call or engagement with the president, I don’t have anything to predict on that front.”

When asked about Biden-Imran phone call, White House says it has no knowledge of that

The journalist then reminded Ms Psaki that Prime Minister Khan said at recent a public gathering that “he will not be a slave of America like other (Pakistani) politicians”.
“Would you like to comment on that?” he asked.
“We have a long relationship with Pakistan, and that is a relationship we’ll continue through diplomatic channels. So, I don’t have any more comments on that,” Ms Psaki responded.
Last month, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said at a news briefing that the United States still considered Pakistan a strategic partner and Islamabad does not need to strain its relations with Beijing to maintain ties with Washington.
“Pakistan is a strategic partner of the United States. We have an important relationship with the government in Islamabad, and it’s a relationship that we value across a number of fronts,” he said.
Pakistan was a close US ally during the cold war and remained so till the collapse of the Soviet Union. Pakistan played a key role in the anti-Soviet war in Afghanistan and partnered with the United States in the war against terrorism as well.
The relationship started to sour when Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was found in Abbottabad and the Obama administration took him out without informing Islamabad.
In July 2019, Prime Minister Khan made an “official working” visit to Washington where he met the then president Donald Trump at the White House. He had another meeting with Mr Trump in New York during the UN General Assembly in September 2019.
Since then, there has been no face-to-face meeting between the leaders of the two countries and President Biden is yet to make a courtesy call to the Pakistani prime minister.

2022-03-21,2022-03-20,Opposition ‘walks back’ threat to disrupt OIC meeting,Leaders had warned of sit-in in NA if no-trust move not placed on agenda.,"ISLAMABAD: Hours after threatening to take the extreme step of disrupting the all-important meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC) in case National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser did not put the no-confidence resolution against Prime Minister Imran Khan on the day’s agenda by Monday (tomorrow), the joint opposition toned down its stance by stressing that Pakistan’s political turmoil will not be allowed to affect the event in any way.
Though the opposition did not make a categorical announcement withdrawing its threat to stage a sit-in inside the National Assembly, the venue of the OIC event, it assured the foreign ministers of the Muslim countries that upon their arrival and during their stay in Islamabad, “a conducive atmosphere in accordance with the traditional spirit of hospitality, respect and zeal would be ensured”.
The assurance was given by the joint opposition through a statement released to the media on Saturday night by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) information secretary Marriyum Aurangzeb, around five hours after the opposition leaders’ press conference where they had announced staging a sit-in inside the National Assembly hall ahead of the OIC meeting, if the speaker did not include the resolution on the agenda of the sitting to be called on Monday (tomorrow).
The threat had been hurled by Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and was immediately endorsed by PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif. Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) president Maulana Fazlur Rehman and chief of his own faction of Balochistan National Party (BNP), Akhtar Mengal, were also present.

Leaders had warned of sit-in in NA if no-trust move not placed on agenda

The joint opposition, however, in its statement later said it would warmly welcome the foreign ministers, delegates and other dignitaries of the Islamic world to Pakistan on the occasion of the 48th meeting of the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers, adding “the arrival of distinguished guests is a source of joy and pride for us”.
“The opposition pledges to do its utmost to create an atmosphere in which the distinguished guests will be able to carry out their activities with full attention, dedication and determination,” said the statement.
Bilawal’s clarification
Later, Zulfikar Ali Bader, the spokesperson for Bilawal, also issued a clarification of sorts, declaring the PPP chairman was not against the OIC meeting, “but against the government’s escape from the no-confidence motion”.
“If the NA speaker delays the no-confidence motion under the guise of the OIC meeting, then there will be a reaction,” he said.
Mr Bader said PM Khan wanted to postpone the no-confidence motion till April under the garb of the OIC conference “but we will not allow Imran Khan to do so”.
Sources in the opposition told Dawn that after their news conference, their leadership met again and reviewed their announcement after receiving a reaction, not only from the government, but also from some public and other circles, as there was a general view that any attempts to disrupt the OIC event would bring a bad name to the country.
Earlier, during the news conference, Mr Bhutto-Zardari had stated that if the speaker did not introduce the no-confidence resolution in the assembly immediately after offering fateha (for a deceased PTI MNA) on Monday (tomorrow) then “my plea to my own party and the opposition parties will be that we will not leave the hall”.
“We will see how you will organise the OIC meeting,” he had stated about the gathering for which even the corps commanders in their last meeting had declared that it would be provided complete security and protection.
The PPP chairman’s remarks were endorsed by Mr Sharif, who said if the speaker did not run the house after offering prayers, “we will be compelled to stage a sit-in inside the assembly hall”.
The threats from the opposition had come amid reports that the government was planning to call the assembly session on Monday afternoon (tomorrow) on the requisition of the opposition, and that the speaker would adjourn it for three to four days due to Pakistan Day and OIC meetings after offering fateha for the departed soul of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) MNA from Hangu Khayal Zaman.
Parliamentary tradition
As per parliamentary tradition, the House does not take up any agenda on the first sitting held after the death of any member. Since this will be the first sitting after Mr Zaman’s death, it is expected the speaker may announce a prolonged adjournment after offering fateha.
Moreover, there are reports the government is planning to file a reference before the Supreme Court (SC) on Monday morning seeking interpretation of Article 63-A of the Constitution regarding disqualification of MNAs, and that the speaker may give a ruling during the sitting that since the matter is pending before the apex court, he could not put the no-trust resolution to vote.
Under Article 95 of the Constitution, the speaker cannot put a no-confidence resolution for a vote before three days and after seven days of its presentation before the House. The speaker, however, is bound to convene the assembly session by Monday, as the opposition had submitted the requisition notice to the National Assembly Secretariat on March 8, and he could not delay calling the session beyond 14 days.
Parliamentary history showed that the Lower House of parliament had on a number of occasions ignored the tradition of adjourning a sitting without taking up any agenda item due to the death of an MNA when something important was on the day’s plan. One such occasion came up on June 22, 2012 during the PPP government, when the National Assembly session had been convened for the election of a new prime minister after disqualification of Yousuf Raza Gilani. It was the first sitting of the House after the death of PPP MNA Fauzia Wahab, who had died on June 17.
The then speaker, Dr Fehmida Mirza -- now an ally of the PTI government -- had ignored the calls of the opposition to adjourn the sitting, and allowed the members to continue the election process after PPP’s Syed Naveed Qamar argued that since it was not a regular session, therefore, the tradition should be ignored and voting allowed.
Interestingly, the plea to adjourn the sitting had been made by Maulana Fazlur Rehman.
During the presser on Saturday, Mr Bhutto-Zardari had said they also wanted the OIC meeting to take place. But, he said, “the only way for it to happen without any problems is that the speaker plays his due role”.
“He (the speaker) should think about the country, democracy and the OIC,” Bilawal stressed.
“If he begins the no-confidence proceedings on Monday, there would be no issues in the way of the OIC and we, too, will not have any objections,” he added.
Shehbaz Sharif said those coming to attend the OIC meeting were the guests of the nation. “But we will not allow you to go against the law and Constitution under the garb of this [OIC conference]. We will stage a sit-in then,” he had declared.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Finding and filling health  gaps digitally,"While various startups addresses a spectrum of challenges, till the net is cast wider and deeper, health tech will not be a...","“A man was having severe heart problems in Loralai, Balochistan,” narrates Dr Sara Saeed Khurram, co-founder of Sehat Kahani. “It was during the peak of the pandemic when the country was under lockdown and access to medical advice, tricky at the best of times in remote areas of Pakistan, had become all the more challenging. But he was able to connect to a doctor through Sehat Kahani and got prescribed the required medicine that helped save his life.”
With a ratio of one doctor for every 1,200 patients, half the population of Pakistan does not have access to basic primary healthcare services. Hand-in-hand is the phenomenon of doctor bahus: women who train medically but for a myriad of reasons are unable to practice in a country that desperately needs more doctors.
Born out of Dr Khurram’s personal experience, Sehat Kahani is a health tech social enterprise that provides a solution to both problems. “I was practicing when I had to shift cities. By chance, I connected to the nurse on duty at my old desk who told me patients were still coming to the clinic but no doctor was available. I started consulting on the phone and eventually got a webcam. Over time the chance encounter evolved into Sehat Kahani,” says Dr Khurram.
Operating through a network of 37 clinics, to date Sehat Kahani has offered 850,000 consultations and employs 7,000 doctors of which 85 per cent are females.

While various startups addresses a spectrum of challenges, till the net is cast wider and deeper, health tech will not be a panacea for all healthcare problems in Pakistan

According to the global health security index 2021, Pakistan is ranked 130 out of 195. From being able to access medical advice to the purchase of genuine medicine to recognising the presence of a disease, there are challenges across the entire process. Digitisation has stepped in to address many of the gaps of which Sehat Kahani is a case in point.
“We have saved six people from committing suicide in Pakistan,” says Syed Naseh, CTO of Saaya Health, a mental health platform. Available in seven languages globally and Urdu, Punjabi, Pashto and Sindhi in Pakistan, Saaya Health has conducted over 4,000 counselling sessions and its social-emotional learning content has reached about 100,000 children.
One in four people in Pakistan suffer from mental health issues. In Karachi, where multi-generational families live in small apartments, one in three suffer from depression and anxiety. And yet, there is a taboo around mental health with those seeking it as perceived to be ‘mad’, explains COO Alizeh Valjee who has a background in psychology.
During the pandemic, relationship issues were exacerbated, increasing domestic violence. The rate of disability and dysfunction increased in those with existing mental health issues along with burnout rates. Stress related to financial insecurities, rise in unemployment and poverty, lack of access to social support and recreational outlets, inability to access the health system during the lockdown and overall anxiety due to uncertainty together made an environment highly conducive to debilitating mental health and holistic wellbeing.
But things are improving, says Mr Naseh. Mental health is becoming less of a taboo, more literature is being produced and more universities are offering psychology cases, he said while giving the example of the recently held Karachi Wellness Festival.
However, all access to healthcare becomes meaningless if the medicines bought to address the illnesses are fake. And Pakistan’s problems with counterfeit drugs is endemic, with some research statistics indicating that 40-50pc of medicine sold are fake.
“We are trying to connect the pharma companies directly to the patient to help eliminate fake medicines from the system,” says Furquan Kidwai, founder and CEO of online pharmacy Dawaai.
There are 500-plus pharmaceutical companies in the country that are manufacturing drugs distributed by 1000-plus distributors through 45,000-plus licensed pharmacies, he explains using numbers to explain how fragmented the market is. This has resulted in the creation of many layers between the pharma company and the end consumer that has allowed one of the biggest counterfeit medicine markets in the world to flourish.
Because of the cryogenic nature of the market, there are about 20,000 unique SKUs (stock-taking units) available for about 500-600 medicines — each medicine is sold under 10-15 different names. “Take Paracetamol as an example. It is sold under 30 different names — Panadol, Paramol, Parasol etc,” he says.
An average shop has say about 200 SKUs so patients have to go through the hassle of visiting multiple pharmacies to get their prescription fulfilled. The pandemic pushed Dawaai’s user adoption rate to 5x-6x, leading to a current growth rate of 9x. 
The health tech numbers are impressive. One source says there are 331 health tech startups in Pakistan, another says telehealth companies grew by 900pc during the pandemic. But this picture is skewed. While various health tech addresses a spectrum of challenges, from menstrual health to setting up appointments with doctors, the ease of access is limited to the relatively affluent that have access to the internet and a basic understanding of technology. Till the net is cast wider and deeper, health tech will not be a panacea for all healthcare problems in Pakistan.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Looking towards the small guy,"There are more than 3,000 Pakistani sellers on Alibaba.com with close to 90pc of them coming from Sialkot","

Mr Song Song, Country Manager, Ali Baba

 
For as long as one can remember, Pakistan has been stuck in a perpetual cycle of boom and busts. Ask any minister, finance bro or stock analyst masquerading as an economist the recipe to break free from this and they will tell you increasing exports is the answer. That’s also something Commerce Advisor Abdul Razak Dawood has made a key priority since the first day. 
One such measure his ministry could claim credit for was getting Pakistan placed on the Amazon’s sellers’ list, which we were told would open new avenues for exports for local entrepreneurs. How many of those businesses, mostly used to business-to-business (B2B )contracts, would actually be able to position themselves in the direct-to-consumer (D2C) segment on arguably the most competitive marketplace on the planet was a different matter altogether. 

There are more than 3,000 Pakistani sellers on Alibaba.com with close to 90pc of them coming from Sialkot

Meanwhile, a few thousand businesses from the country had focused their energies eastward towards Alibaba.com. In fact, Pakistan now ranks the highest in terms of paid sellers on the world’s largest B2B e-commerce platform’s Global Business. Since 2017-18, the number of Pakistani sellers on the platform has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent, according to a presentation the company presented to a roundtable at the Board of Investment’s recent conference. 
“There are more than 3,000 Pakistani sellers on Alibaba.com with close to 90pc of them coming from Sialkot,” says Mr Song Song, the company’s country manager for Pakistan. And now he wants to expand the platform’s reach to traders and businesses in other cities, especially the export-oriented ones like Faisalabad and Gujranwala, in addition to Karachi and Lahore. For that purpose, he and his team have been increasing their outreach efforts through awareness sessions at the various chambers of commerce and industries. 
“Apparel is the most popular category among Pakistani sellers, followed by sports goods and surgical equipment given that the majority of our users are from Sialkot,” he shares. According to the ‘Digital B2B Outlook 2022 Pakistan’ published by Alibaba at the beginning of the year, 63pc of the sellers are in the apparel category while a total of 3.2 million listings have been made from the country so far. But how much does that translate into dollar terms? “Unfortunately even we don’t know the gross merchandise value of goods sold from the country on our platform,” Mr Song Song says. 
That’s strange, isn’t it? Maybe at first. As a B2B e-commerce platform facilitating cross-border trade across hundreds of geographies, Alibaba.com is used by many buyers and sellers for discovery and information before actually negotiating the deal between themselves. “Outside China, the US and Malaysia, the transactions still take place offline so it becomes difficult for us to estimate the worth of goods sold,” the executive explains. 
The reason behind that is, of course, the complicated nature of B2B payments which is made even more complex due to the cross-border nature of transactions. “It’s not like B2C where the average order value would be a few dollars. You are talking hundreds of thousands or even a million dollars per order which the current infrastructure doesn’t allow for in Pakistan. And payments are just one component of it; there’s also fulfilment, integration with customs authorities etc. That entire ecosystem needs to be built,” Mr Song Song says.  
In that case, who else to build the ecosystem other than Alibaba.com — the most successful B2B e-commerce platform? “It requires huge amounts of investments as well as time. In China, it took us around five years to develop it,” he says. Before the company embarks on such an ambitious plan, it first wants to create a local presence and create more awareness among the sellers. 
“We are going to set up a local entity for Alibaba.com, the first such for any of the companies of the Alibaba Group [excluding Daraz and Easypaisa as they were acquisitions], and build an on-ground team in Pakistan for functions like customer service, outreach and marketing by the end of the calendar year,” Mr SongSong shares. This is along with growing their channel partners — currently numbering 10 — who currently act as the e-commerce platform’s representatives in the country and help onboard new users and provide support to the existing ones.

2021-07-27,2022-03-21,Hasty growth in housing finance,The euphoric demand for housing finance and a liberal supply of loans remains subject to ground reality checks.,"Agriculture and housing loans — along with micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) finance — are vital for boosting economic activity. And, if banks start lending more to all the three sectors at the same time, that almost guarantees accelerated GDP growth in the short-to-medium term. 
Currently, though, banks are not wholesomely engaged in such an exercise. But the government and the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) are trying to promote just that. Policies introduced for accelerating housing loans offer an added advantage to the government — they make room for politically-motivated tax amnesty in the name of the documentation of the economy. The ongoing Naya Pakistan Housing Programme (NPHP) is no exception.
Regardless of the fact that this is opening yet another avenue under this programme for the whitening of tax-evaded money, housing loans being offered under NPHP are quite promising. Already, they have reactivated the real estate and building construction sector and continue to enliven demand for outputs of dozens of allied industries and services sub-sectors. Their impact on the overall economy (rebased to 2015-16) is already being felt and is sure to become more and more pronounced with the passage of time. That is if future governments let the programme continue in its current form and spirit.

The euphoric demand for housing finance and liberal supply of loans remains subject to ground reality checks after the expiry of the tax amnesty scheme 

Within seven months of this fiscal year (ie between July 2021 and Jan 2022), banks disbursed fresh consumers loans of Rs47.6 billion for the construction of buildings. In addition to this, they also disbursed Rs11.8bn loans to their employees for the same purpose.
Thus, overall lending for construction of buildings in the first seven months of this fiscal year totalled Rs59.4bn, the latest SBP stats reveal. During the same period of the last fiscal year, total lending for housing buildings was too small — Rs7.9bn for general consumers and Rs22bn for bank employees or a total of Rs29.9bn! 
The demand for housing finance remained strong right from the beginning of this fiscal year partly because builders were using tax-evaded money for launching new housing projects following extension in the tax amnesty scheme. Partly, higher economic growth in 2021-21 compared to that of 2019-20 also motivated people to take advantage of the Naya Pakistan Housing Programme made easier this year — and apply for housing loans. 
So, the volumes of housing finance offered so far could have been larger had banks been able to process loans applications a bit more speedily. The PTI government, challenged on all fronts and struggling for its survival, is pushing banks to their limits through the central bank to accelerate the disbursement of housing loans. So, one can hope that the volumes of fresh housing loans would grow even faster in near future, more so because the “no-question asked” status of the investment coming into this sector has been extended — once again — to the end of FY22 in June.

The overall lending for construction of buildings in the first seven months of this fiscal year totalled Rs59.4bn while during the same period last fiscal year, total lending for housing buildings was Rs7.9bn for general consumers and Rs22bn for bank employees or a total of Rs29.9bn

Growth in housing finance and underlying expansion in construction activities continue to fuel growth in allied sectors as well. During July-Dec 2021, manufacturing of iron and steel grew by 18.4 per cent, whereas in the same period of 2020 this sub-sector of large-scale manufacturing had contracted by 12.1pc, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics. 
Monthly cement production which was below 3.7 million tonnes in July 2021 gradually picked up and peaked at 4.48m tonnes in October before coming down to 4.3m tonnes and 4m tonnes in November and December respectively, due to a dramatic rise in the cost of production of coal-fired cement plants after skyrocketing of coal prices in international markets — and not due to slackness in demand. 
To meet the increasing demand for housing finance, and particularly to meet the demand for low-cost housing, the SBP has now eased prudential regulations of microfinance banks. “The changes made in the prudential regulations include additional guidance on property assessment, mortgage creation and risk management,” the central bank announced on March 16. By end of 2021, total lending already made in the housing sector stood at Rs20bn — the number of beneficiaries was 75,000, an SBP press release said.
Moving forward, accelerated disbursement of housing finance through microfinance banks can be expected to boost volumes of financing and enhance the number of loan takers. But whether microfinance loans for housing can actually lead to the construction of new low-cost housing units is doubtful. These loans are likely to end up for purchasing already constructed flats and one-unit residential units or for the renovation of existing houses and apartments. 
The current euphoric demand for housing finance from commercial banks and an equally liberal supply of housing loans remain subject to ground reality checks after the expiry of the tax amnesty scheme in June. If tax amnesty for investment in the housing sector is allowed to expire on time — and not extended any further — construction of new houses and apartments may come to a halt. But that perhaps doesn’t bother the government. 
Another worrisome aspect of the housing finance euphoria is that banks are offering housing loans to their employees, particularly senior executives, a bit too liberally. The central bank needs to watch mortgage finance to bank employees closely to ward off any possible development of banks-builders nexus. Powerful builders particularly those with strong links with politicians and the establishment have successfully circumvented banking and environmental laws in the past for the construction of prized projects both in Karachi and Islamabad. Some of them still continue to do this. 
While making more housing loans, banks must also focus on ensuring their sustainability in terms of market risks and the risk of defaults.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,The challenges of the electronic warehouse receipt system,"If run professionally and efficiently, it may reduce pressure on farmers to sell their produce in panic immediately ...","The resource-constraint smallholder farmers are unattractive candidates for credit from formal financial institutions, which tend to ignore them because of their often unpredictable, fragmented and unstructured agricultural activities.
The State Bank of Pakistan, like the central banks of many other developing countries, is introducing schemes to increase access of small farmers to the formal credit channels, saving them from exploitation by informal money lenders.
The SBP, in this respect, has recently launched the electronic warehouse receipt (EWR) system for maize crop in Kasur district, almost a year after the scheme was introduced for paddy crop in Hafizabad, another central Punjab district. The EWR enables the depositor, whether a producer or dealer, of an agriculture commodity to use it as collateral for obtaining bank loans or trade in commodity markets, if and when the system is linked with the commodities exchange as well.
If run professionally and efficiently, it may also reduce pressure on farmers to sell their produce in panic immediately after harvests when prices are normally low. Thus, it may ensure a better return to farmers for their financial and physical investment and also help stabilise market prices. The system may also reduce post-harvest losses as care of the stored commodity is handed over to certified warehouses equipped with the required facilities and expertise.

If run professionally and efficiently, it may reduce pressure on farmers to sell their produce in panic immediately after harvests when prices are normally low while allowing agriculture commodities to be used as collateral for bank loans

However, the insufficient number of certified warehouses complying with preservation norms, lack of awareness among farmers and their limited business skills, and no incentives for buyers to purchase commodities from the warehouses are identified as the stumbling blocks in the expansion of the system.
Afaq Tiwana, a progressive farmer, says the EWR may be beneficial for the community only if the SBP scheme includes a blueprint for bridging the infrastructure (warehouses and logistics) gap. “There is an acute shortage of certified warehouses and reliable logistic facilities that are required to run the system satisfactorily.” He advocates for incentivising the infrastructure building by assuring business for the owners of the storage units the whole year so that they are attracted to invest more and more in the sector.
For this purpose, he argues, the government needs to get out of the business of wheat, the biggest crop of the country. The government is the major player in the wheat market but does not utilise private warehouses depriving them of around six-month business, he says. A mix of wheat, rice and maize crops, etc will ensure the warehouses do business throughout the year because of their different seasons. Mr Tiwana says for food security the government may buy grain from the warehouses if and when required through bidding.
Ibad Khan, president of Guava Growers Association, endorses the views saying by opting for the private warehousing system the government may save non-development expenditures worth billions of rupees consumed by thousands of Food Department employees in the name of salaries and perks, operating costs of their vehicles and buildings, etc “without doing any good”.
“The (provincial) government may buy four million tonnes of wheat from the certified warehouses through the Pakistan Commodities Exchange and lift the grain when needed from there. It will equal a surplus of thousands of food department employees and thus save huge funds required for the functioning of the department, as well as the hassle of checking theft of the crop from its storages by unscrupulous staff.”
Mr Khan thinks the farm produce warehousing concept may gain currency provided the farming community is given proper awareness and the purpose is well served easily by engaging the Agriculture Department’s field staff. “If a farmer learns that by spending Rs50, for instance, as storage rent, his produce will earn Rs100 then he will automatically turn towards the EWR scheme. The extension wing of the Agriculture Department is in close proximity to the rural population and may help mobilise them for it.”
An attractive package to build high-quality warehouses can find 15 to 20 investors in each village ready to build the storage if provided information/guidance about the business scope and initial technical assistance in running the facilities until these become self-sufficient, he asserts.
While the functioning of the facility will benefit the farming community in many ways, Mr Tiwana says the prevailing farm produce trade system is built to make the rich richer. “At present 70 to 80 per cent of commodities are sold at harvesting time in the country. And thus, these fetch lower rates for the farmers. Large processors and the influential (textile, feed, flour millers, etc) have huge amounts of cash at hand and make these purchases knowing that the prices will shoot up within months. Besides value-addition through their mills, they also earn a big profit through commodities trade, robbing millions of farmers of the money that actually belongs to them.”
The EWR facility will save the poor farmers from panic selling as well as stabilise prices in the open market at harvesting time because an adequate quantity of the produce would have been deposited with the warehouses, freeing the market from surplus crops. This would ensure a better return even for those farmers who will be opting to sell their produce in the spot market, he adds.
Mr Khan stresses that the warehousing concept must be linked to the Commodities Exchange for the sake of the sustainability of the system and that the Exchange should be relocated to Punjab, the largest producer of agricultural products so that those involved in active farming have easy access to it. He laments that no farmer association was engaged by the SBP or any other government entity to seek their input for the scheme.
For Amer Hayat Bhandara, a progressive grower from Pakpattan, the EWR facility seems to be working only for those farmers and final buyers who are qualified customers of commercial banks. He points out that one of the most common problems of the farmer is informal debt: farmers take loans from people in the market with personal guarantees and with a condition that the crop will be sold through them.
Will the middlemen allow the farmer to go for the EWR, he questions? Suppose if farmers want to do so, then the debt of the middleman will be repaid through EWR, but how will the inputs like seeds, fertilisers, fuel and pesticides for the next crop be acquired?

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Business leaders and sleepless nights,It’s time to lie low as there is no chance of any clarity till the no-confidence move is over.,"


 
THE critical domains of the economy and foreign affairs have taken a back seat as the political leadership has been left to scramble for continuing in power. This seems to be rather dicey in a world that is trying to deal with fragile energy markets and food security in its Covid-battered existence, and global peace in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
In addition to tales of human sufferings, the war has disturbed global commodity markets, disrupted supply chains, hiked freight charges and posed challenges to the global financial system after the West slapped harsh sanctions on Russia and excluded it from the SWIFT system of money transfers. Experts and economists have predicted slower growth and an increase in inflation worldwide.   
Instead of strategising to deal with the evolving global challenges, Islamabad appears to be too busy to care. Global experts have included Pakistan amongst the more vulnerable nations where the impact of the fallout of war is expected to be severe owing to the resource-deficient country’s dependence on oil, gas and edible imports.

It’s time to lie low as there is no chance of any clarity till the no-confidence move is over

Just as the masses are doing, businesses are also watching closely the events unfolding at a bewildering pace under the full glare of the media spotlight. With the final outcome not quite certain, the whole saga is keeping business houses unnerved.
The common man is desperately waiting for the debilitating economic stress to ease off to the extent that it possibly can, while the business class is dreading a hostile reaction of the West to the hard stance of the government towards the US and Europe. The handshake images of Prime Minister Imran Khan and President Putin in Moscow on the day Russia launched its attack on Ukraine has already placed the country in an awkward position. 
Some like to project the current situation in Pakistan as the expected manifestation of civil unrest over inflation and job losses, while others link it to be the outcome of deeper structural imbalance. And then there are those who see the struggle rooted in efforts to uphold the supremacy of civilian leadership. 
Argumentative Pakistanis can debate the politics, but they all agree that the economy and its challenges have taken a back seat for now and things will be difficult irrespective of the final outcome of the no-confidence motion in parliament.
The leading lights of business class, when approached for a comment, were evasive. Afraid to land on the wrong side of the current or the future set of rulers, they shared their disappointment with the political class privately, saying it was frustrating to watch the politicians “stoop too low whenever tested”. 
A senior business leader commented” “Prime Minister Imran Khan and his confidants are inciting violence much like Trump did in the US. How can they not understand the consequences? If politicians fail to resist the temptation to take their conflict out of parliament it can make the country drift towards anarchy. Yes, we are worried for our businesses, but we are more concerned about the safety and security of our family and the future of this country.” 
Musadaq Zulqarnain, of Interloop fame, believed that “irrespective of the outcome of the vote in parliament or the movement on the streets, the economy is not in a good shape. It will get worse because of political turbulence which will be followed by popular measures to please the masses without fundamental corrections. 
“Pakistan needs a sustained growth of 7-8 per cent for several years, powered by an increase in exports if it wants to come out of its economic troubles. The only solution is a consensus document — the Charter of Economy — which must be vigorously followed irrespective of the party in power,” he said.
Nasser Hayat Magoon, former president of the Federation of Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), said the troubles had aggravated in the last couple of years. The budget, he thought, has failed to spark much interest among the legislators. In his opinion, it is influenced by “a select group of businessmen that encircles the leadership”. 
Sources in the Ministry of Finance told Dawn that the budget exercise initiated in January has been in progress at the routine pace. 
Pulling out his wish-list, Mr Magnoon said: “The FPCCI suggested simplification of taxation, which was promised but was resisted by the tax bureaucracy. We do not expect a business-friendly budget. The timing of the budget will be contingent on how the present chaotic political situation settles.” 
He said the private sector needs to communicate with political parties and sensitise them to the variety of problems that are being faced by businesses. He warned that street agitation in the current charged environment may have serious consequences. 
Mian Anjum Nisar, another business leader, lamented the lack of clarity in politics, while Majyd Aziz was critical of mismatched priorities of successive governments. 
Regardless of the concerns voiced by the business community, everybody realises that at least in the short term, there is no chance of any clarity till the no-confidence move is over.

2022-07-27,2022-03-21,Auto parts — setting a new record for imports,New entrants are rolling out vehicles with mere 5pc locally made parts which is insufficient to reduce foreign exchange burden.,"Pakistan’s import bill for completely and semi-knocked down (CKD/SKD) kits for cars imported by local assemblers has crossed one billion dollars in just eight months of 2021-22 which is significantly higher than the record high bill of $1.12 billion for the entire of FY21.
The 8MFY22 ended with $1.102bn as compared to $557 million in the same period last fiscal. 
The low levels of localisation by Chinese and Korean investors under Auto Policy 2016-2021 for five years as well as in the new models by existing assemblers have played a key role in boosting the import bill.
As per data of the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the new and old entrants brought CKD/SKD kits worth $4.987bn from 2016-2017 to July-February 2021-2022, thus nullifying claims of achieving higher localisation.
Sources said that the new entrants have started rolling out vehicles from their assembly lines with a mere five per cent locally made parts which is insufficient to reduce the burden on the foreign exchange. 

New entrants are rolling out vehicles with mere five per cent locally made parts which is insufficient to reduce the burden on the foreign exchange rate

Assemblers are now in top gear as the eight months of FY22 ended with a whooping sales jump of 57.5pc in cars to 149,813 units. They are also excited over huge bookings in hands whose delivery time ranges between three months to 11 months. Jeeps and pickups sales have also surged by 51.5pc in 8MFY22 to 28,437 units.
Huge demand for cars has led to a massive jump in CKD/SKD imports to $1.120bn in FY21 from $478mn in FY20, up by 134pc thanks to low-interest rates and attractive auto financing by the banks till the third quarter of 2021
However, curbs on auto financing from the last quarter of 2021, persistent increase in car prices and long delays in delivery appear to have not hurt the buyers’ sentiments in the last eight months, while buyers are also satisfied over the rising resale value of the vehicles owing to months’ long delivery timings, soaring prices and on-money for vehicles for immediate delivery. 
The import bill of CKD/SKD was $660m in FY17 which later swelled to $809m in FY18 and then remained at $818mn in FY19. The fiscal year 2019-2020 was a bad year for the entire country due to the flare-up in Covid-19 from March to June followed by the government’s decision to close down the industrial units in April 2020. As a result, the FY20 import bill of CKD/SKD was just $478m.
Stakeholders had been trumpeting 70pc localisation in Suzuki Mehran which ruled the roads for over 30 years without significant model change. After the end of the iconic Mehran journey in 2018, the claim of achieving higher localisation by stakeholders has now been confined to 55-60pc in various existing Japanese models and 35-45pc in new models. 
It seems that no serious efforts have been made by the existing Japanese assemblers in the old and new models to improve the utilisation levels  of locally made parts in vehicles.
A vendor, who asked not to be named, said the import bill of CKD/SKD would remain under pressure as the new entrants, who had approved their projects under the Auto Policy 2016-2021, would enjoy a honeymoon period for the next four to five years to keep rolling out vehicles with negligible local content. Besides, new models by the existing Japanese assemblers will also take time in improving local content in the vehicles.
He said vendors had asked the government not to allow vehicles’ assembly of higher engine power under tAuto Policy 2016-2021. The new entrants, instead of introducing small cars below 800cc, shifted their focus towards the assembly of high engine power sports utility vehicles (SUV) whose numbers are growing every day.
Chief Operating Officer, Balochistan Wheel Limited (BWL), Muhammad Irfan Ghani in a letter to the CEO Engineering Development Board (EDB) said the EDB is the custodian of the auto vending industry which encourages the localisation of auto parts.
The auto sector in Pakistan is now more than 50 years old but the assemblers have not done localisation seriously, he complained.
He said the pace of localisation of auto parts is too slow due to the discouraging attitudes and lengthy procedures adopted by the assemblers which form a monopoly for their foreign principals. They protect their own interests to use their CKD parts and have made localisation very  difficult. 
Mr Ghani said the country’s precious foreign exchange is being wasted due to non-localisation while many assemblers are not taking parts from the local vendors in some of their newly launched models.
The matter came up for discussion during the first meeting of the Auto Industry Development and Export Committee (AIDEC) held on March 8, 2022, which was attended by the auto stakeholders and officials of the relevant ministries. The AIDEC meeting had decided that the EDB would schedule a joint meeting between Baluchistan Wheels and Pak Suzuki to resolve the matter.
However, AIDEC committee members reiterated that the localisation of parts and components must be pursued in letter and spirit. 
Former Chairman Pakistan Association of Parts and Accessories Manufacturers (Paapam), Abdul Rahman Aizaz attributed the rising import bill of CKD to the massive revival in sales of cars and SUVs from the depressed sales scenario of 2019-2020.
Under Auto Policy 2016-2021, most of the new entrants have focused on manufacturing SUVs, which too has resulted in the higher value of CKD imports. He said that sales volumes of new entrants and old players have shown phenomenal growth due to improving economic indicators.
Since the new entrants under Auto Policy 2016-21 can avail the concession on import of CKD for five years, localisation of parts in such vehicles, especially of SUVs, is in the catching-up phase, he added.
Mr Aizaz said that the unprecedented surge in international prices of various resins and metals, rupee devaluation against the dollar and multiple times higher freight charges have further enhanced the landed cost of almost all raw materials.

2022-02-27,2022-03-21,Surviving tough times,"Regardless of who wins and who loses the no-trust motion, the government will not find it easy to handle the economy.","The rupee hit its lowest ever of over 180 to a dollar in the interbank market on the weekend as the shares market continues to decline. 
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) appears largely satisfied with the PTI government’s explanation of the Rs346 billion relief package announced late last month in an apparent attempt to appease the inflation-stricken households. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) kept the key policy rate unchanged at 9.75 per cent but its warning that it could advance the next Monetary Policy Committee meeting to raise the interest rates if need be has pushed cut-off yields in the last public sector debt auction.
The political instability in the wake of a no-confidence motion submitted by the opposition to oust the prime minister is forcing the government to take populist measures that it might not have if it weren’t facing the existential threat from the opposition political parties that have come together to push Imran Khan out of power in spite of their deep divisions. 

Regardless of who wins and who loses the no-trust motion, the government will not find it easy to handle the economy — many hard decisions will have to be made

No one expected the Kaptaan to go away without fighting till the last ball, but the last week’s events in Islamabad have spawned fears of violence. The storming of the Parliament Lodges, where the opposition lawmakers were housed by police commandos and counter-terrorism force was followed by the attack of the PTI workers on Sindh House in Islamabad. It happened after the opposition gave media access to the place to interview dissident parliamentarians of the ruling party. 
The ruling party’s insistence to gather a million people outside the parliament in the event of the vote on the no-confidence resolution and the threats being tossed around by the ministers has forced the opposition political parties to make their own plans to counter the move. Indeed, everyone expected the prime minister to fight back — but not in this way. 
The situation is fluid and may likely continue for several weeks to come, with its impact expected to reverberate for many months. Regardless of who wins and who loses the no-trust motion, the government will not find it easy to handle the economy. Many tough decisions will have to be made. If the opposition succeeds in de-seating the prime minister, it will have its work cut out for them. 
The first job would be to approach the IMF to release the next tranche to shore up foreign exchange reserves and take the pressure off the home currency. PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has already hinted at renegotiating the deal with the multilateral lender. It is not clear if the Washington-based fund would be more kind to the new government than the Imran Khan administration. 
The second job, the businessmen interviewed by telephone over the weekend say, for whoever — the PTI or the opposition parties — is in power after the vote on the motion would be to mend Pakistan’s relationship with the West, especially the United States. “That does not necessarily mean that we have to dial down our ties with China. Going to Russia when the Kremlin had planned to attack Ukraine was a big foreign policy mistake Imran Khan made. He could have called off the tour and stayed neutral. That would not have brought upon us such pressure from the European Union and the US, with which our relations are already facing problems due to the Taleban takeover of Kabul last summer,” a textile exporter argued. 
“Improvement in our ties with Washington and European capitals is crucial not only for securing some concessions from the IMF but also to get out of the grey list of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).”
A senior executive of a chemical company was of the view that once politics cool down Islamabad will have to reconsider its policy towards India. “If you think you can improve your relationship with the West and get off the FATF’s enhanced monitoring regime without making some kind of headway with New Delhi, you are totally mistaken. I have information that our present military leadership too is in favour of resuming ties with India,” he claimed.
However, there are others who feel that the top priority has to be given to the resolution of domestic political problems. “The settlement of the outstanding issues with the IMF and the western powers is important. But more important is to tackle our domestic problems first. I cannot say if the present government will be in power after a few days or not. But in my opinion, once this crisis is over, all the parties must sit together and develop a consensus on electoral reforms so that we can have political stability. I think that the government term of five years should be curtailed to four years. We are very impatient people and a kind of fatigue starts to take over us every three to four years. If we manage to clean up our political mess, we will be able to put back the economy on the rails and end our international isolation.”

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Finding and filling health  gaps digitally,"While various startups addresses a spectrum of challenges, till the net is cast wider and deeper, health tech will not be a...","“A man was having severe heart problems in Loralai, Balochistan,” narrates Dr Sara Saeed Khurram, co-founder of Sehat Kahani. “It was during the peak of the pandemic when the country was under lockdown and access to medical advice, tricky at the best of times in remote areas of Pakistan, had become all the more challenging. But he was able to connect to a doctor through Sehat Kahani and got prescribed the required medicine that helped save his life.”
With a ratio of one doctor for every 1,200 patients, half the population of Pakistan does not have access to basic primary healthcare services. Hand-in-hand is the phenomenon of doctor bahus: women who train medically but for a myriad of reasons are unable to practice in a country that desperately needs more doctors.
Born out of Dr Khurram’s personal experience, Sehat Kahani is a health tech social enterprise that provides a solution to both problems. “I was practicing when I had to shift cities. By chance, I connected to the nurse on duty at my old desk who told me patients were still coming to the clinic but no doctor was available. I started consulting on the phone and eventually got a webcam. Over time the chance encounter evolved into Sehat Kahani,” says Dr Khurram.
Operating through a network of 37 clinics, to date Sehat Kahani has offered 850,000 consultations and employs 7,000 doctors of which 85 per cent are females.

While various startups addresses a spectrum of challenges, till the net is cast wider and deeper, health tech will not be a panacea for all healthcare problems in Pakistan

According to the global health security index 2021, Pakistan is ranked 130 out of 195. From being able to access medical advice to the purchase of genuine medicine to recognising the presence of a disease, there are challenges across the entire process. Digitisation has stepped in to address many of the gaps of which Sehat Kahani is a case in point.
“We have saved six people from committing suicide in Pakistan,” says Syed Naseh, CTO of Saaya Health, a mental health platform. Available in seven languages globally and Urdu, Punjabi, Pashto and Sindhi in Pakistan, Saaya Health has conducted over 4,000 counselling sessions and its social-emotional learning content has reached about 100,000 children.
One in four people in Pakistan suffer from mental health issues. In Karachi, where multi-generational families live in small apartments, one in three suffer from depression and anxiety. And yet, there is a taboo around mental health with those seeking it as perceived to be ‘mad’, explains COO Alizeh Valjee who has a background in psychology.
During the pandemic, relationship issues were exacerbated, increasing domestic violence. The rate of disability and dysfunction increased in those with existing mental health issues along with burnout rates. Stress related to financial insecurities, rise in unemployment and poverty, lack of access to social support and recreational outlets, inability to access the health system during the lockdown and overall anxiety due to uncertainty together made an environment highly conducive to debilitating mental health and holistic wellbeing.
But things are improving, says Mr Naseh. Mental health is becoming less of a taboo, more literature is being produced and more universities are offering psychology cases, he said while giving the example of the recently held Karachi Wellness Festival.
However, all access to healthcare becomes meaningless if the medicines bought to address the illnesses are fake. And Pakistan’s problems with counterfeit drugs is endemic, with some research statistics indicating that 40-50pc of medicine sold are fake.
“We are trying to connect the pharma companies directly to the patient to help eliminate fake medicines from the system,” says Furquan Kidwai, founder and CEO of online pharmacy Dawaai.
There are 500-plus pharmaceutical companies in the country that are manufacturing drugs distributed by 1000-plus distributors through 45,000-plus licensed pharmacies, he explains using numbers to explain how fragmented the market is. This has resulted in the creation of many layers between the pharma company and the end consumer that has allowed one of the biggest counterfeit medicine markets in the world to flourish.
Because of the cryogenic nature of the market, there are about 20,000 unique SKUs (stock-taking units) available for about 500-600 medicines — each medicine is sold under 10-15 different names. “Take Paracetamol as an example. It is sold under 30 different names — Panadol, Paramol, Parasol etc,” he says.
An average shop has say about 200 SKUs so patients have to go through the hassle of visiting multiple pharmacies to get their prescription fulfilled. The pandemic pushed Dawaai’s user adoption rate to 5x-6x, leading to a current growth rate of 9x. 
The health tech numbers are impressive. One source says there are 331 health tech startups in Pakistan, another says telehealth companies grew by 900pc during the pandemic. But this picture is skewed. While various health tech addresses a spectrum of challenges, from menstrual health to setting up appointments with doctors, the ease of access is limited to the relatively affluent that have access to the internet and a basic understanding of technology. Till the net is cast wider and deeper, health tech will not be a panacea for all healthcare problems in Pakistan.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Looking towards the small guy,"There are more than 3,000 Pakistani sellers on Alibaba.com with close to 90pc of them coming from Sialkot","

Mr Song Song, Country Manager, Ali Baba

 
For as long as one can remember, Pakistan has been stuck in a perpetual cycle of boom and busts. Ask any minister, finance bro or stock analyst masquerading as an economist the recipe to break free from this and they will tell you increasing exports is the answer. That’s also something Commerce Advisor Abdul Razak Dawood has made a key priority since the first day. 
One such measure his ministry could claim credit for was getting Pakistan placed on the Amazon’s sellers’ list, which we were told would open new avenues for exports for local entrepreneurs. How many of those businesses, mostly used to business-to-business (B2B )contracts, would actually be able to position themselves in the direct-to-consumer (D2C) segment on arguably the most competitive marketplace on the planet was a different matter altogether. 

There are more than 3,000 Pakistani sellers on Alibaba.com with close to 90pc of them coming from Sialkot

Meanwhile, a few thousand businesses from the country had focused their energies eastward towards Alibaba.com. In fact, Pakistan now ranks the highest in terms of paid sellers on the world’s largest B2B e-commerce platform’s Global Business. Since 2017-18, the number of Pakistani sellers on the platform has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent, according to a presentation the company presented to a roundtable at the Board of Investment’s recent conference. 
“There are more than 3,000 Pakistani sellers on Alibaba.com with close to 90pc of them coming from Sialkot,” says Mr Song Song, the company’s country manager for Pakistan. And now he wants to expand the platform’s reach to traders and businesses in other cities, especially the export-oriented ones like Faisalabad and Gujranwala, in addition to Karachi and Lahore. For that purpose, he and his team have been increasing their outreach efforts through awareness sessions at the various chambers of commerce and industries. 
“Apparel is the most popular category among Pakistani sellers, followed by sports goods and surgical equipment given that the majority of our users are from Sialkot,” he shares. According to the ‘Digital B2B Outlook 2022 Pakistan’ published by Alibaba at the beginning of the year, 63pc of the sellers are in the apparel category while a total of 3.2 million listings have been made from the country so far. But how much does that translate into dollar terms? “Unfortunately even we don’t know the gross merchandise value of goods sold from the country on our platform,” Mr Song Song says. 
That’s strange, isn’t it? Maybe at first. As a B2B e-commerce platform facilitating cross-border trade across hundreds of geographies, Alibaba.com is used by many buyers and sellers for discovery and information before actually negotiating the deal between themselves. “Outside China, the US and Malaysia, the transactions still take place offline so it becomes difficult for us to estimate the worth of goods sold,” the executive explains. 
The reason behind that is, of course, the complicated nature of B2B payments which is made even more complex due to the cross-border nature of transactions. “It’s not like B2C where the average order value would be a few dollars. You are talking hundreds of thousands or even a million dollars per order which the current infrastructure doesn’t allow for in Pakistan. And payments are just one component of it; there’s also fulfilment, integration with customs authorities etc. That entire ecosystem needs to be built,” Mr Song Song says.  
In that case, who else to build the ecosystem other than Alibaba.com — the most successful B2B e-commerce platform? “It requires huge amounts of investments as well as time. In China, it took us around five years to develop it,” he says. Before the company embarks on such an ambitious plan, it first wants to create a local presence and create more awareness among the sellers. 
“We are going to set up a local entity for Alibaba.com, the first such for any of the companies of the Alibaba Group [excluding Daraz and Easypaisa as they were acquisitions], and build an on-ground team in Pakistan for functions like customer service, outreach and marketing by the end of the calendar year,” Mr SongSong shares.

2021-07-27,2022-03-21,Hasty growth in housing finance,The euphoric demand for housing finance and a liberal supply of loans remains subject to ground reality checks.,"Agriculture and housing loans — along with micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) finance — are vital for boosting economic activity. And, if banks start lending more to all the three sectors at the same time, that almost guarantees accelerated GDP growth in the short-to-medium term. 
Currently, though, banks are not wholesomely engaged in such an exercise. But the government and the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) are trying to promote just that. Policies introduced for accelerating housing loans offer an added advantage to the government — they make room for politically-motivated tax amnesty in the name of the documentation of the economy. The ongoing Naya Pakistan Housing Programme (NPHP) is no exception.
Regardless of the fact that this is opening yet another avenue under this programme for the whitening of tax-evaded money, housing loans being offered under NPHP are quite promising. Already, they have reactivated the real estate and building construction sector and continue to enliven demand for outputs of dozens of allied industries and services sub-sectors. Their impact on the overall economy (rebased to 2015-16) is already being felt and is sure to become more and more pronounced with the passage of time. That is if future governments let the programme continue in its current form and spirit.

The euphoric demand for housing finance and liberal supply of loans remains subject to ground reality checks after the expiry of the tax amnesty scheme 

Within seven months of this fiscal year (ie between July 2021 and Jan 2022), banks disbursed fresh consumers loans of Rs47.6 billion for the construction of buildings. In addition to this, they also disbursed Rs11.8bn loans to their employees for the same purpose.
Thus, overall lending for construction of buildings in the first seven months of this fiscal year totalled Rs59.4bn, the latest SBP stats reveal. During the same period of the last fiscal year, total lending for housing buildings was too small — Rs7.9bn for general consumers and Rs22bn for bank employees or a total of Rs29.9bn! 
The demand for housing finance remained strong right from the beginning of this fiscal year partly because builders were using tax-evaded money for launching new housing projects following extension in the tax amnesty scheme. Partly, higher economic growth in 2021-21 compared to that of 2019-20 also motivated people to take advantage of the Naya Pakistan Housing Programme made easier this year — and apply for housing loans. 
So, the volumes of housing finance offered so far could have been larger had banks been able to process loans applications a bit more speedily. The PTI government, challenged on all fronts and struggling for its survival, is pushing banks to their limits through the central bank to accelerate the disbursement of housing loans. So, one can hope that the volumes of fresh housing loans would grow even faster in near future, more so because the “no-question asked” status of the investment coming into this sector has been extended — once again — to the end of FY22 in June.

The overall lending for construction of buildings in the first seven months of this fiscal year totalled Rs59.4bn while during the same period last fiscal year, total lending for housing buildings was Rs7.9bn for general consumers and Rs22bn for bank employees or a total of Rs29.9bn

Growth in housing finance and underlying expansion in construction activities continue to fuel growth in allied sectors as well. During July-Dec 2021, manufacturing of iron and steel grew by 18.4 per cent, whereas in the same period of 2020 this sub-sector of large-scale manufacturing had contracted by 12.1pc, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics. 
Monthly cement production which was below 3.7 million tonnes in July 2021 gradually picked up and peaked at 4.48m tonnes in October before coming down to 4.3m tonnes and 4m tonnes in November and December respectively, due to a dramatic rise in the cost of production of coal-fired cement plants after skyrocketing of coal prices in international markets — and not due to slackness in demand. 
To meet the increasing demand for housing finance, and particularly to meet the demand for low-cost housing, the SBP has now eased prudential regulations of microfinance banks. “The changes made in the prudential regulations include additional guidance on property assessment, mortgage creation and risk management,” the central bank announced on March 16. By end of 2021, total lending already made in the housing sector stood at Rs20bn — the number of beneficiaries was 75,000, an SBP press release said.
Moving forward, accelerated disbursement of housing finance through microfinance banks can be expected to boost volumes of financing and enhance the number of loan takers. But whether microfinance loans for housing can actually lead to the construction of new low-cost housing units is doubtful. These loans are likely to end up for purchasing already constructed flats and one-unit residential units or for the renovation of existing houses and apartments. 
The current euphoric demand for housing finance from commercial banks and an equally liberal supply of housing loans remain subject to ground reality checks after the expiry of the tax amnesty scheme in June. If tax amnesty for investment in the housing sector is allowed to expire on time — and not extended any further — construction of new houses and apartments may come to a halt. But that perhaps doesn’t bother the government. 
Another worrisome aspect of the housing finance euphoria is that banks are offering housing loans to their employees, particularly senior executives, a bit too liberally. The central bank needs to watch mortgage finance to bank employees closely to ward off any possible development of banks-builders nexus. Powerful builders particularly those with strong links with politicians and the establishment have successfully circumvented banking and environmental laws in the past for the construction of prized projects both in Karachi and Islamabad. Some of them still continue to do this. 
While making more housing loans, banks must also focus on ensuring their sustainability in terms of market risks and the risk of defaults.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,The challenges of the electronic warehouse receipt system,"If run professionally and efficiently, it may reduce pressure on farmers to sell their produce in panic immediately ...","The resource-constraint smallholder farmers are unattractive candidates for credit from formal financial institutions, which tend to ignore them because of their often unpredictable, fragmented and unstructured agricultural activities.
The State Bank of Pakistan, like the central banks of many other developing countries, is introducing schemes to increase access of small farmers to the formal credit channels, saving them from exploitation by informal money lenders.
The SBP, in this respect, has recently launched the electronic warehouse receipt (EWR) system for maize crop in Kasur district, almost a year after the scheme was introduced for paddy crop in Hafizabad, another central Punjab district. The EWR enables the depositor, whether a producer or dealer, of an agriculture commodity to use it as collateral for obtaining bank loans or trade in commodity markets, if and when the system is linked with the commodities exchange as well.
If run professionally and efficiently, it may also reduce pressure on farmers to sell their produce in panic immediately after harvests when prices are normally low. Thus, it may ensure a better return to farmers for their financial and physical investment and also help stabilise market prices. The system may also reduce post-harvest losses as care of the stored commodity is handed over to certified warehouses equipped with the required facilities and expertise.

If run professionally and efficiently, it may reduce pressure on farmers to sell their produce in panic immediately after harvests when prices are normally low while allowing agriculture commodities to be used as collateral for bank loans

However, the insufficient number of certified warehouses complying with preservation norms, lack of awareness among farmers and their limited business skills, and no incentives for buyers to purchase commodities from the warehouses are identified as the stumbling blocks in the expansion of the system.
Afaq Tiwana, a progressive farmer, says the EWR may be beneficial for the community only if the SBP scheme includes a blueprint for bridging the infrastructure (warehouses and logistics) gap. “There is an acute shortage of certified warehouses and reliable logistic facilities that are required to run the system satisfactorily.” He advocates for incentivising the infrastructure building by assuring business for the owners of the storage units the whole year so that they are attracted to invest more and more in the sector.
For this purpose, he argues, the government needs to get out of the business of wheat, the biggest crop of the country. The government is the major player in the wheat market but does not utilise private warehouses depriving them of around six-month business, he says. A mix of wheat, rice and maize crops, etc will ensure the warehouses do business throughout the year because of their different seasons. Mr Tiwana says for food security the government may buy grain from the warehouses if and when required through bidding.
Ibad Khan, president of Guava Growers Association, endorses the views saying by opting for the private warehousing system the government may save non-development expenditures worth billions of rupees consumed by thousands of Food Department employees in the name of salaries and perks, operating costs of their vehicles and buildings, etc “without doing any good”.
“The (provincial) government may buy four million tonnes of wheat from the certified warehouses through the Pakistan Commodities Exchange and lift the grain when needed from there. It will equal a surplus of thousands of food department employees and thus save huge funds required for the functioning of the department, as well as the hassle of checking theft of the crop from its storages by unscrupulous staff.”
Mr Khan thinks the farm produce warehousing concept may gain currency provided the farming community is given proper awareness and the purpose is well served easily by engaging the Agriculture Department’s field staff. “If a farmer learns that by spending Rs50, for instance, as storage rent, his produce will earn Rs100 then he will automatically turn towards the EWR scheme. The extension wing of the Agriculture Department is in close proximity to the rural population and may help mobilise them for it.”
An attractive package to build high-quality warehouses can find 15 to 20 investors in each village ready to build the storage if provided information/guidance about the business scope and initial technical assistance in running the facilities until these become self-sufficient, he asserts.
While the functioning of the facility will benefit the farming community in many ways, Mr Tiwana says the prevailing farm produce trade system is built to make the rich richer. “At present 70 to 80 per cent of commodities are sold at harvesting time in the country. And thus, these fetch lower rates for the farmers. Large processors and the influential (textile, feed, flour millers, etc) have huge amounts of cash at hand and make these purchases knowing that the prices will shoot up within months. Besides value-addition through their mills, they also earn a big profit through commodities trade, robbing millions of farmers of the money that actually belongs to them.”
The EWR facility will save the poor farmers from panic selling as well as stabilise prices in the open market at harvesting time because an adequate quantity of the produce would have been deposited with the warehouses, freeing the market from surplus crops. This would ensure a better return even for those farmers who will be opting to sell their produce in the spot market, he adds.
Mr Khan stresses that the warehousing concept must be linked to the Commodities Exchange for the sake of the sustainability of the system and that the Exchange should be relocated to Punjab, the largest producer of agricultural products so that those involved in active farming have easy access to it. He laments that no farmer association was engaged by the SBP or any other government entity to seek their input for the scheme.
For Amer Hayat Bhandara, a progressive grower from Pakpattan, the EWR facility seems to be working only for those farmers and final buyers who are qualified customers of commercial banks. He points out that one of the most common problems of the farmer is informal debt: farmers take loans from people in the market with personal guarantees and with a condition that the crop will be sold through them.
Will the middlemen allow the farmer to go for the EWR, he questions? Suppose if farmers want to do so, then the debt of the middleman will be repaid through EWR, but how will the inputs like seeds, fertilisers, fuel and pesticides for the next crop be acquired?

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Business leaders and sleepless nights,It’s time to lie low as there is no chance of any clarity till the no-confidence move is over.,"


 
THE critical domains of the economy and foreign affairs have taken a back seat as the political leadership has been left to scramble for continuing in power. This seems to be rather dicey in a world that is trying to deal with fragile energy markets and food security in its Covid-battered existence, and global peace in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
In addition to tales of human sufferings, the war has disturbed global commodity markets, disrupted supply chains, hiked freight charges and posed challenges to the global financial system after the West slapped harsh sanctions on Russia and excluded it from the SWIFT system of money transfers. Experts and economists have predicted slower growth and an increase in inflation worldwide.   
Instead of strategising to deal with the evolving global challenges, Islamabad appears to be too busy to care. Global experts have included Pakistan amongst the more vulnerable nations where the impact of the fallout of war is expected to be severe owing to the resource-deficient country’s dependence on oil, gas and edible imports.

It’s time to lie low as there is no chance of any clarity till the no-confidence move is over

Just as the masses are doing, businesses are also watching closely the events unfolding at a bewildering pace under the full glare of the media spotlight. With the final outcome not quite certain, the whole saga is keeping business houses unnerved.
The common man is desperately waiting for the debilitating economic stress to ease off to the extent that it possibly can, while the business class is dreading a hostile reaction of the West to the hard stance of the government towards the US and Europe. The handshake images of Prime Minister Imran Khan and President Putin in Moscow on the day Russia launched its attack on Ukraine has already placed the country in an awkward position. 
Some like to project the current situation in Pakistan as the expected manifestation of civil unrest over inflation and job losses, while others link it to be the outcome of deeper structural imbalance. And then there are those who see the struggle rooted in efforts to uphold the supremacy of civilian leadership. 
Argumentative Pakistanis can debate the politics, but they all agree that the economy and its challenges have taken a back seat for now and things will be difficult irrespective of the final outcome of the no-confidence motion in parliament.
The leading lights of business class, when approached for a comment, were evasive. Afraid to land on the wrong side of the current or the future set of rulers, they shared their disappointment with the political class privately, saying it was frustrating to watch the politicians “stoop too low whenever tested”. 
A senior business leader commented” “Prime Minister Imran Khan and his confidants are inciting violence much like Trump did in the US. How can they not understand the consequences? If politicians fail to resist the temptation to take their conflict out of parliament it can make the country drift towards anarchy. Yes, we are worried for our businesses, but we are more concerned about the safety and security of our family and the future of this country.” 
Musadaq Zulqarnain, of Interloop fame, believed that “irrespective of the outcome of the vote in parliament or the movement on the streets, the economy is not in a good shape. It will get worse because of political turbulence which will be followed by popular measures to please the masses without fundamental corrections. 
“Pakistan needs a sustained growth of 7-8 per cent for several years, powered by an increase in exports if it wants to come out of its economic troubles. The only solution is a consensus document — the Charter of Economy — which must be vigorously followed irrespective of the party in power,” he said.
Nasser Hayat Magoon, former president of the Federation of Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), said the troubles had aggravated in the last couple of years. The budget, he thought, has failed to spark much interest among the legislators. In his opinion, it is influenced by “a select group of businessmen that encircles the leadership”. 
Sources in the Ministry of Finance told Dawn that the budget exercise initiated in January has been in progress at the routine pace. 
Pulling out his wish-list, Mr Magnoon said: “The FPCCI suggested simplification of taxation, which was promised but was resisted by the tax bureaucracy. We do not expect a business-friendly budget. The timing of the budget will be contingent on how the present chaotic political situation settles.” 
He said the private sector needs to communicate with political parties and sensitise them to the variety of problems that are being faced by businesses. He warned that street agitation in the current charged environment may have serious consequences. 
Mian Anjum Nisar, another business leader, lamented the lack of clarity in politics, while Majyd Aziz was critical of mismatched priorities of successive governments. 
Regardless of the concerns voiced by the business community, everybody realises that at least in the short term, there is no chance of any clarity till the no-confidence move is over.

2022-07-27,2022-03-21,Auto parts — setting a new record for imports,New entrants are rolling out vehicles with mere 5pc locally made parts which is insufficient to reduce foreign exchange burden.,"Pakistan’s import bill for completely and semi-knocked down (CKD/SKD) kits for cars imported by local assemblers has crossed one billion dollars in just eight months of 2021-22 which is significantly higher than the record high bill of $1.12 billion for the entire of FY21.
The 8MFY22 ended with $1.102bn as compared to $557 million in the same period last fiscal. 
The low levels of localisation by Chinese and Korean investors under Auto Policy 2016-2021 for five years as well as in the new models by existing assemblers have played a key role in boosting the import bill.
As per data of the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the new and old entrants brought CKD/SKD kits worth $4.987bn from 2016-2017 to July-February 2021-2022, thus nullifying claims of achieving higher localisation.
Sources said that the new entrants have started rolling out vehicles from their assembly lines with a mere five per cent locally made parts which is insufficient to reduce the burden on the foreign exchange. 

New entrants are rolling out vehicles with mere five per cent locally made parts which is insufficient to reduce the burden on the foreign exchange rate

Assemblers are now in top gear as the eight months of FY22 ended with a whooping sales jump of 57.5pc in cars to 149,813 units. They are also excited over huge bookings in hands whose delivery time ranges between three months to 11 months. Jeeps and pickups sales have also surged by 51.5pc in 8MFY22 to 28,437 units.
Huge demand for cars has led to a massive jump in CKD/SKD imports to $1.120bn in FY21 from $478mn in FY20, up by 134pc thanks to low-interest rates and attractive auto financing by the banks till the third quarter of 2021
However, curbs on auto financing from the last quarter of 2021, persistent increase in car prices and long delays in delivery appear to have not hurt the buyers’ sentiments in the last eight months, while buyers are also satisfied over the rising resale value of the vehicles owing to months’ long delivery timings, soaring prices and on-money for vehicles for immediate delivery. 
The import bill of CKD/SKD was $660m in FY17 which later swelled to $809m in FY18 and then remained at $818mn in FY19. The fiscal year 2019-2020 was a bad year for the entire country due to the flare-up in Covid-19 from March to June followed by the government’s decision to close down the industrial units in April 2020. As a result, the FY20 import bill of CKD/SKD was just $478m.
Stakeholders had been trumpeting 70pc localisation in Suzuki Mehran which ruled the roads for over 30 years without significant model change. After the end of the iconic Mehran journey in 2018, the claim of achieving higher localisation by stakeholders has now been confined to 55-60pc in various existing Japanese models and 35-45pc in new models. 
It seems that no serious efforts have been made by the existing Japanese assemblers in the old and new models to improve the utilisation levels  of locally made parts in vehicles.
A vendor, who asked not to be named, said the import bill of CKD/SKD would remain under pressure as the new entrants, who had approved their projects under the Auto Policy 2016-2021, would enjoy a honeymoon period for the next four to five years to keep rolling out vehicles with negligible local content. Besides, new models by the existing Japanese assemblers will also take time in improving local content in the vehicles.
He said vendors had asked the government not to allow vehicles’ assembly of higher engine power under tAuto Policy 2016-2021. The new entrants, instead of introducing small cars below 800cc, shifted their focus towards the assembly of high engine power sports utility vehicles (SUV) whose numbers are growing every day.
Chief Operating Officer, Balochistan Wheel Limited (BWL), Muhammad Irfan Ghani in a letter to the CEO Engineering Development Board (EDB) said the EDB is the custodian of the auto vending industry which encourages the localisation of auto parts.
The auto sector in Pakistan is now more than 50 years old but the assemblers have not done localisation seriously, he complained.
He said the pace of localisation of auto parts is too slow due to the discouraging attitudes and lengthy procedures adopted by the assemblers which form a monopoly for their foreign principals. They protect their own interests to use their CKD parts and have made localisation very  difficult. 
Mr Ghani said the country’s precious foreign exchange is being wasted due to non-localisation while many assemblers are not taking parts from the local vendors in some of their newly launched models.
The matter came up for discussion during the first meeting of the Auto Industry Development and Export Committee (AIDEC) held on March 8, 2022, which was attended by the auto stakeholders and officials of the relevant ministries. The AIDEC meeting had decided that the EDB would schedule a joint meeting between Baluchistan Wheels and Pak Suzuki to resolve the matter.
However, AIDEC committee members reiterated that the localisation of parts and components must be pursued in letter and spirit. 
Former Chairman Pakistan Association of Parts and Accessories Manufacturers (Paapam), Abdul Rahman Aizaz attributed the rising import bill of CKD to the massive revival in sales of cars and SUVs from the depressed sales scenario of 2019-2020.
Under Auto Policy 2016-2021, most of the new entrants have focused on manufacturing SUVs, which too has resulted in the higher value of CKD imports. He said that sales volumes of new entrants and old players have shown phenomenal growth due to improving economic indicators.
Since the new entrants under Auto Policy 2016-21 can avail the concession on import of CKD for five years, localisation of parts in such vehicles, especially of SUVs, is in the catching-up phase, he added.
Mr Aizaz said that the unprecedented surge in international prices of various resins and metals, rupee devaluation against the dollar and multiple times higher freight charges have further enhanced the landed cost of almost all raw materials.

2022-02-27,2022-03-21,Surviving tough times,"Regardless of who wins and who loses the no-trust motion, the government will not find it easy to handle the economy.","The rupee hit its lowest ever of over 180 to a dollar in the interbank market on the weekend as the shares market continues to decline. 
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) appears largely satisfied with the PTI government’s explanation of the Rs346 billion relief package announced late last month in an apparent attempt to appease the inflation-stricken households. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) kept the key policy rate unchanged at 9.75 per cent but its warning that it could advance the next Monetary Policy Committee meeting to raise the interest rates if need be has pushed cut-off yields in the last public sector debt auction.
The political instability in the wake of a no-confidence motion submitted by the opposition to oust the prime minister is forcing the government to take populist measures that it might not have if it weren’t facing the existential threat from the opposition political parties that have come together to push Imran Khan out of power in spite of their deep divisions. 

Regardless of who wins and who loses the no-trust motion, the government will not find it easy to handle the economy — many hard decisions will have to be made

No one expected the Kaptaan to go away without fighting till the last ball, but the last week’s events in Islamabad have spawned fears of violence. The storming of the Parliament Lodges, where the opposition lawmakers were housed by police commandos and counter-terrorism force was followed by the attack of the PTI workers on Sindh House in Islamabad. It happened after the opposition gave media access to the place to interview dissident parliamentarians of the ruling party. 
The ruling party’s insistence to gather a million people outside the parliament in the event of the vote on the no-confidence resolution and the threats being tossed around by the ministers has forced the opposition political parties to make their own plans to counter the move. Indeed, everyone expected the prime minister to fight back — but not in this way. 
The situation is fluid and may likely continue for several weeks to come, with its impact expected to reverberate for many months. Regardless of who wins and who loses the no-trust motion, the government will not find it easy to handle the economy. Many tough decisions will have to be made. If the opposition succeeds in de-seating the prime minister, it will have its work cut out for them. 
The first job would be to approach the IMF to release the next tranche to shore up foreign exchange reserves and take the pressure off the home currency. PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has already hinted at renegotiating the deal with the multilateral lender. It is not clear if the Washington-based fund would be more kind to the new government than the Imran Khan administration. 
The second job, the businessmen interviewed by telephone over the weekend say, for whoever — the PTI or the opposition parties — is in power after the vote on the motion would be to mend Pakistan’s relationship with the West, especially the United States. “That does not necessarily mean that we have to dial down our ties with China. Going to Russia when the Kremlin had planned to attack Ukraine was a big foreign policy mistake Imran Khan made. He could have called off the tour and stayed neutral. That would not have brought upon us such pressure from the European Union and the US, with which our relations are already facing problems due to the Taleban takeover of Kabul last summer,” a textile exporter argued. 
“Improvement in our ties with Washington and European capitals is crucial not only for securing some concessions from the IMF but also to get out of the grey list of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).”
A senior executive of a chemical company was of the view that once politics cool down Islamabad will have to reconsider its policy towards India. “If you think you can improve your relationship with the West and get off the FATF’s enhanced monitoring regime without making some kind of headway with New Delhi, you are totally mistaken. I have information that our present military leadership too is in favour of resuming ties with India,” he claimed.
However, there are others who feel that the top priority has to be given to the resolution of domestic political problems. “The settlement of the outstanding issues with the IMF and the western powers is important. But more important is to tackle our domestic problems first. I cannot say if the present government will be in power after a few days or not. But in my opinion, once this crisis is over, all the parties must sit together and develop a consensus on electoral reforms so that we can have political stability. I think that the government term of five years should be curtailed to four years. We are very impatient people and a kind of fatigue starts to take over us every three to four years. If we manage to clean up our political mess, we will be able to put back the economy on the rails and end our international isolation.”

2022-03-20,2022-03-21,"IMF seeks details of petrol, power subsidy funding",Finance minister makes it clear there are no more outstanding issues as the IMF only wants to ascertain sources of funding.,"


 
ISLAMABAD: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has sought copies of financial agreements with the provincial governments and other details from the federal government to confirm the financing of discounts on electricity and petroleum products announced by Prime Minister Imran Khan, Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin disclosed at a press conference on Sunday.
The talks with the IMF were earlier scheduled to conclude on Friday last but then “they [Fund staff] wanted to see agreements with the provinces to basically reassure we are not involved in aerial firing” on financing of PM’s relief package for petroleum prices, the minister said.
Mr Tarin made it clear that there were no more outstanding issues, as they only wanted to ascertain the sources of funding to cover the cost of reduction in electricity and petroleum products. They were assured the package would be covered through provincial shares and dividends of the state-owned entities, he said. “They said show us agreements with the provinces,” he remarked.
The federal government has signed rolling memorandums of understanding with the provinces to provide cash surplus every year to show lower consolidated fiscal deficit but are sometimes remain unhonoured when provinces also go into overdrafts.
“So there is no problem. We already have agreements that we will show them” when the two sides would meet again on Monday, the minister said, adding he would hold a final policy round up with the fund mission on Tuesday. 
The two sides will then finalise the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) amicably and take it to the executive board on a convenient date.
After initial compliance with the commitments made with the IMF in December 2021 to increase petroleum levy and power tariff, PM Khan reversed the progress by announcing Rs10 per litre reduction in petroleum products bringing down levy to zero besides a cut in electricity rates by Rs5 per unit instead of a schedule of increases agreed to with the IMF to address circular debt.
Up to 700,000-tonne wheat import
Responding to a question, Mr Tarin said all the provinces were part of the minimum wheat support price at Rs2,200 per 40 kg approved by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet last week — about 13 per cent higher than Rs1,950 of last year and showed confidence to exceed procurement target that was also set at 6.9 million tonnes last week.
He said the wheat production was then estimated to be 5pc to 6pc higher and may not require imports except 500,000 to 700,000 tonnes for strategic reserves. “I would like to increase strategic reserves from 1.8 million tonnes to two million tonnes, depending on international prices,” he said, adding he would not burn foreign exchange if international wheat prices remain higher.
In response to a question about former PML-N finance minister Miftah Ismail’s statement that the country could not launch international bonds as Pakistan’s bond yields had gone high due to economic policies and fundamentals, Mr Tarin said his statement would not change ground reality. This was not Pakistan specific but with entire developing countries including Turkey, Indonesia and others, he remarked.
Mr Tarin said financing was not an issue but the interest rates being offered were higher. He said he still had $4-5bn worth of offers from banks, but “why should I take expensive loans?” Mr Miftah should also recall they had left the government with just one-month import financing that now stood at $16.6bn – against average monthly imports of about $7bn in eight months, he added.
Responding to a question whether he would continue as finance minister in the next government if asked, Mr Tarin said he was a man of principles and would at no cost do that as he was a PTI senator. “I will remain finance minister if the PTI government stays, otherwise will go home. I am not a renegade,” he said.
He expressed the hope that 5pc economic growth rate was expected despite various headwinds this year, as some sectors were also showing robust growth including large-scale manufacturing, agriculture and exports. “This shows there is thrust in the economy and momentum is returning,” he said, adding that this did not mean there were no headwinds but policy adjustments would continue to absorb them.
“The welcome news is that the LSM has grown by 8.2pc in January against same month of last year and 4.2pc against December 2021,” he said, adding the LSM growth had slowed down in August and September 2021 but the trend had reversed. “Our economic growth momentum has picked up again as all agriculture crops are growing at 6 to 12 percent, and exports and services sectors are also growing at a high pace,” the minister pointed out.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,NA speaker summons no-trust session on 25th,"Government to file reference in SC today to end politics of ""sale and purchase"".","ISLAMABAD: In an apparent move to prolong the voting on a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan, National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser on Sunday summoned the session of the lower house of parliament on March 25, violating the Constitution under which he is bound to convene a session within 14 days after the submission of a requisition. 
Meanwhile, the government also took a significant decision under which it will file a reference in the Supreme Court on Monday (today), seeking “an opinion” of the apex court on two main points — whether the disqualification of a legislator is for life time and whether the dissident MNAs of any party can cast vote on a no-confidence resolution. 
The speaker, who under the Constitution was bound to call the NA session by March 21 [within 14 days after the opposition’s requisition], gave an excuse that since the three-day conference of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) would be held in the NA hall, there was no other place in the federal capital to convene the NA session. 
This is despite the fact that the capital offers alternative locations where such an event can be held such as the spacious Jinnah Convention Centre, Prime Minister Secretariat, Pak-China Centre, two five-star hotels, etc. 

Government to file reference in SC today to end politics of ‘sale and purchase’

The opposition lashed out at the speaker for his decision to hold the NA session on March 25, saying he had violated the Constitution to prolong the voting on no-trust motion. 
Sources in the government told Dawn that the decisions to hold the NA session on March 25 and filing of the reference in the Supreme Court were taken at a meeting presided over by Prime Minister Khan at his Banigala residence on Sunday. 
Speaker Asad Qaiser issued an order saying the [opposition’s] requisition was received on March 8 for summoning the National Assembly. Whereas, on Jan 21, 2022, a motion had been adopted by the NA to allow the exclusive use of NA chamber for the 48th session of the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers scheduled for March 22, 23 or any other date. 
He said the renovation work on the NA chamber and its lobbies had commenced on the requirement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the end of February 2022, which was under taken by the Capital Development Authority. 
The speaker said that after the receipt of [the opposition’s] requisition, the NA Secretariat requested the Senate Secretariat to provide chamber of the Senate for holding the NA session, but the latter pointed out that the Senate chamber was also not available for being under renovation. 
“Thereafter, the CDA chairman and deputy commissioner, Islamabad, were also approached to arrange and provide a suitable building for holding the session of the National Assembly outside the parliament building, at Islamabad. However, they have informed in writing that no suitable place is available at present in Islamabad for holding the NA session,” Mr Qaisar added. 
“In view of the aforementioned facts and circumstances, it is evident that no suitable place would be available for holding the session of the NA till March 24. Having no adequate option available whatsoever, for holding of the NA session before March 24, therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under clause (3) of Article 54 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, read with Article 254 of the Constitution, I hereby summon the session of the National Assembly on the first available date i.e. Friday, March 25 at 11.00am at the Parliament House, Islamabad,” the order said. 
Meanwhile, Planning and Development Minister Asad Umar said in a tweet that the government would file a reference in the Supreme Court that would end the politics of “sell and purchase” and diminish the influence of “easy money” and “influence in politics”. 



 
When contacted, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said the decision to file the reference was taken by the prime minister in a meeting on Sunday. “The basic reasons of filing the reference are — to know whether the disqualification of any legislators is for lifetime and that can PTI dissidents cast vote on the no-trust motion,” he added. 
A source said the NA speaker could call the session on March 21 to meet the constitutional requirement [within 14 days after the requisition] and adjourn the session for three days for the OIC conference and it could resume on March 24. 
According to Article 63 of the Constitution, the prime minister is given three days after the tabling of a no-trust motion, for preparation. However, the government is apparently trying to linger on the voting on the motion — first by an excuse of “lack of suitable place for the session till March 25” and then filing of the reference in the Supreme Court. 
The information minister said the government was only seeking an opinion of the apex court and it could be given by the court even on the first day of filing of the reference or the court could take more time it deemed appropriate. 
Asked why the NA session was not called on March 21, he said the NA hall was not available for the session due to the OIC summit.

2022-03-20,2022-03-21,Opposition calls for Asad Qaiser’s trial under Article 6,"PTI accused of running social media campaign against army; PML-Q wants PM to take notice of ""anti-Pakistan"" drive.","ISLAMABAD / LAHORE: Opposition parties on Sunday slammed National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser for not convening the assembly session within 14 days of its requisition to take up their no-confidence resolution against Prime Minister Imran Khan, demanding that he should be tried under Article 6 of the Constitution.
The opposition parties also lashed out at the PM for, what they called, using the religion card in an effort to save his government and accused his party of launching a ‘propaganda campaign’ through its social media team against the army over its ‘neutrality’.
Speaking at a news conference, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari expressed the hope that the Supreme Court would take notice of the violation of the Constitution by the speaker, proving that there was at least one institution in the country for the protection of the Constitution, democracy and right of the vote of the parliamentarians. 
Stating that the job of the SC was to protect and implement the Constitution, the PPP chairman hoped that the court “will not facilitate this government on its unconstitutional step” and that it would make a constitutional decision, not a political one. 

PTI accused of running social media campaign against army; PML-Q wants PM to take notice of ‘anti-Pakistan’ drive

“We appreciate how the SC sent a message of standing with the law and Constitution, even on a weekend,” he said in an apparent reference to the hearing of a petition of the Supreme Court Bar Association during which the court had reprimanded the government over the attack by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) activists on Sindh House. 
He said the SC was already hearing a petition that had not been filed by them, but the bar association. However, he said the court had issued notices to the political parties as well in the case and they would present their viewpoint before it. 
“This coward captain [the PM] is running away from the vote of no confidence. He is escaping to the extent that he has made the speaker abrogate the Constitution,” the PPP chairman observed. 
Mr Bhutto-Zardari lashed out at PM Khan for using Islam for party politics and asked him not to use the slogan of Madinah state. 
“You (the PM) are the foreign-sponsored and foreign-funded agent who has been planted in our system,” he said while criticising the government’s foreign policy. He alleged that the prime minister had been given the task to damage the country’s foreign policy and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and that he had done it “beautifully”. 
He accused Mr Khan of adopting the foreign policy of India, stating that there was no difference in the foreign policies of the two countries. 
Addressing a separate news conference, PML-N’s senior vice-president Shahid Khaqan Abbasi also accused the speaker and the premier of violating the Constitution and committing treason under Article 6 which, he said, was not a joke. He said if anyone would interfere in the democratic process of no-trust move, he would commit ‘treason’. 
PML-N secretary general Ahsan Iqbal alleged that Mr Khan was using religion card to cover up his “dirty politics and incompetence”. 
Earlier, in a statement, PML-N information secretary Marriyum Aurangzeb stated if the speaker failed to convene the NA session before March 22, he would be guilty of violating the Constitution that was be punishable under Article 6. 
Campaign against institutions
During the news conference, the PPP chairman also alleged that the PM and his social media team had launched a ‘propaganda campaign’ to ‘provoke’ an institution so that it could not remain ‘neutral’. 
“When a time has come when the media is talking about a neutral environment, Imran and his social media team are trying to spread the propaganda that institutions are not neutral, be it through provocation or creating a constitutional crisis,” he said.
“It is the responsibility of all of us to demand and try for every institution to work within its domain drawn by the law and Constitution, and to criticise when this does not happen. However, it is also our responsibility to oppose the prime minister, his social media team and its members who are provoking and targeting an institution under a conspiracy,” he added.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari said the prime minister had equated the term ‘neutral’ with animals and had still not apologised to the nation over it. “Our efforts have always been for neutrality. The PM, his social media team and ministers are making desperate attempts to tarnish neutrality. We condemn this,” he said without elaborating.
The PPP chairman, who had not named the institution during his press conference, later asked the Inter-Service Public Relations and the judiciary to take notice of the propaganda campaign by the PM, his social media team and the MNAs aimed at getting “the status of neutrality” changed.
Though Mr Bhutto-Zardari did not give any reference to the army when he talked about the allegation regarding the propaganda campaign against neutrality, the PML-Q and the PML-N came out more openly when they castigated the PTI government for hitting out at army and Inter-Service Intelligence by a party’s woman MNA and an important member of the PTI’s media team. 
A video clip with the audio of PTI MNA Kanwal Shauzeb shared from a twitter space “Current political situation” went viral on social media in which she could be heard apparently talking about military establishment. “They have nothing to do with performance and neither they want to manage the country. They had never done it in the past, then why will they do it now. Actually, they wanted to hijack the system and working on an agenda of minus-Imran Khan,” she said in the clip, adding that the real issue was that the premier was not allowing those sitting in “different institutions and all kinds of institutions to continue their loot and plunder” and “that’s why they are now having panic attacks”.
Since Saturday afternoon, an unusual debate has started on Twitter with a host of people, apparently the PTI supporters, trying to make the army leadership controversial by levelling all kinds of accusations. They were found accusing the army chief of trying to undermine the government and the present system. 
In response, several people also came out in support of the armed forces, blaming the present government of maligning the armed forces and its chief.
Reacting over the clip, PML-Q MNA Chaudhry Salik Hussain tweeted: “The PTI’s social media team and a woman MNA levelled false allegations on the Pakistan Army and the ISI, which are unacceptable and unbearable.” 
Mr Hussain demanded that the PM must take notice of this “dirty anti-Pakistan campaign, otherwise, the PML-Q knew well how to deal with the anti-Pakistan elements”.



 
Also, the official spokesman for PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif, Malik Ahmad Khan, tweeted that the PTI social media team would not be allowed to defame the Pakistan Army. “The state’s existence gets threatened when a state army’s central authority is compromised,” he said. 



 
“When a state will not respect the status of the institution of army, can a state survive?” he asked in a linked tweet. “The strong army is a guarantor of strong Pakistan,” the spokesman said, adding that every Pakistani was ready to sacrifice his life for country’s solidarity and progress.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Jahangir Tareen group sees their demands being met,A senior party leader in Punjab says the PM has agreed to remove CM Buzdar but wants the dissident group to wait for a while.,"LAHORE: Members of the dissident Jahangir Tareen group in the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) appear confident they will have their way after securing guarantees that the chief minister of Punjab will be removed from office.
Sources in the group told Dawn that Prime Minister Imran Khan had all but “agreed” to accept the demands of the dissident group, but has sought more time to remove Chief Minister Usman Buzdar in order to “avert the impression of being blackmailed”.
Shaken by a no-confidence motion against the premier, the PTI government is on a mission to mend ways with party dissidents. A senior delegation of government members met the Jahangir Tareen group and asked them to explain their concerns and demands in detail.
“The Tareen group remains adamant over the removal of Usman Buzdar and explained their concerns with regards to victimisation, lukewarm response from Chief Minister Office to their problems and the bureaucracy’s attitude towards their group members,” a source in the Tareen group told Dawn.
A senior party leader in Punjab told Dawn the prime minister had agreed to remove CM Buzdar but wanted the dissident group to wait for a while, because an immediate acceptance of the demand would be exploited by the opposition as if “Imran Khan has bowed down to dissidents’ blackmail”.
The PTI government had also conveyed that the new chief minister would be from PTI parliamentarians, the senior party leader said, adding that the Tareen group assured the government team that it did not want to leave the party until it would be compelled to do so.
Problems being resolved
Meanwhile, key Tareen group member Lala Tahir Randhawa said a government team led by cabinet minister Murad Raas had called on the group and agreed to resolve problems that could be addressed through the administration.
Since the government team had been given two days to resolve the parliamentarians’ issue, Mr Randhawa said a response had started to come, as deputy commissioners, district police officers and other government officials were calling all group members to address their problems.
He said that actions taken to victimise him and provincial minister Ajmal Cheema were also being undone. “The government team will return with its problems’ resolution report and the group will meet on Wednesday to take a final decision,” he added.
Mr Randhawa asserted that the group’s main demand was “minus-Buzdar” because the incumbent chief minister had ruined the governance system in the country. “Another large group of MPAs have also contacted the Tareen group and expressed support for its demand of removing Buzdar from Punjab’s chief ministership,” Mr Randhawa revealed.
Answering a question about PTI dissident and former senior minister Abdul Aleem Khan’s conduct with the group after visiting it at Jahangir Tareen’s residence, Mr Randhawa said Aleem Khan did come and a five-member committee was constituted — including Mr Randhawa, Nauman Langrial, Abdul Hayee Dasti and Ajmal Cheema — to coordinate with Aleem Khan. However, Aleem Khan did not call the committee and he alone met Sindh Governor Imran Ismail, who visited him on the instructions of the prime minister.
Sources said the government had conveyed to the Tareen group that CM Buzdar would be replaced by another senior leader within the party and four names have started doing the rounds in the PTI parliamentarians’ circle, including those of provincial minister Raja Yasir Humayun, Murad Raas, Mian Aslam Iqbal and Asif Nakai.
Tareen group members told Dawn that 13 of their 17 MPAs were elected as independents and later joined the party. “Even if the Tareen group decided to vote against PM Imran Khan in the centre and CM Buzdar in Punjab, the government would not be able to de-seat them because they were not elected on PTI tickets,” Mr Randhawa told Dawn.
Tareen ‘held party together’
Meanwhile, Jahangir Tareen’s spokesman Awn Chaudhry said some eight MNAs were standing with the group and take a decision about supporting or not supporting the government in the opposition’s no-confidence motion.
“I was personally disturbed when I saw that several MNAs stood against the party,” he said and added that it all happened because PM Khan pushed away Jahangir Tareen, who was actually keeping all MNAs intact with the party.
“Mr Tareen used to help the prime minister in difficult times and resolve party parliamentarians’ problems,” he said and asked whether the PTI should not hold the premier’s political aides accountable for all this mess.
Answering a question whether Jahangir Tareen could enter into any deal with the PML-N, he said he could not comment on his leader’s behalf. “Whatever Jahangir Tareen will decide, his whole group will go along his decision,” he asserted.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,RED ZONE FILES: All set for a collision course,Some govt officials have started to acknowledge in private that prospects of surviving this challenge from opposition are slim.,"Political entanglements may once again be headed to the courts. 
Speaker Asad Qaiser has summoned the crucial session of the National Assembly on Friday, March 25, which is three days longer than the Constitution has stipulated once the required number of parliamentarians have requisitioned a session. This order further complicates a situation that is fraught with danger and uncertainty. Here’s where things stand today and what they could portend in the coming days:

The PTI government is doing legal gymnastics with constitutional procedures, but there is no way around the vote of no-confidence against Prime Minister Imran Khan. The only way that the PM can retain his job is if the opposition fails to muster a strength of 172 in the lower house during the vote. Or if for some reason, the opposition withdraws the motion. There is no other way out for the PM and his cabinet. Legal experts say the speaker may attempt to delay the process and push the vote forward, and this may ultimately end up in courts, but the vote will need to take place one way or another. What matters is the numbers game. Everything else is a side show.
The courts may in fact become the battleground before the real battle on the floor of the National Assembly. If both the government and the opposition head to the Supreme Court with their petitions, the court may need to pronounce on the following: (i) if Article 63 of the constitution allows the party head to stop errant members of his party from voting on the confidence motion (ii) if the disqualification under Article 3 for members indulging in floor crossing can be a lifetime ban (iii) if the speaker can delay summoning of the National Assembly for more than the two-week limit spelt out in the Constitution and whether he can somehow delay the moving of the motion for the vote of no confidence. 
These issues will be addressed by the Supreme Court this week and a lot will depend on how long the SC takes to pronounce a decision. According to legal experts, if the SC reaffirms the obvious interpretation of the constitutional procedure for the vote of no-confidence, then the government will have no other option but to fight the numbers game, which it appears to be losing at this stage.
The planned rallies by the government and the opposition on Sunday, March 27, have added an explosive element to the volatile situation. Inside the Red Zone, there is a genuine fear that if these rallies are allowed to take place as scheduled, then there is a danger of violence breaking out. Now, imagine the real danger: when such violence ensues between a sitting government and its opponents, what does the police do? And if the police cannot handle such a scenario, the only option is what Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid has been referring to in his speeches: handing over security responsibility to the armed forces.
There is no need for the situation to deteriorate to such a level. But it is being dragged towards such an outcome by the government itself. What is otherwise a straightforward constitutional procedure is being weaponised by the use of mobs and threats. These in turn are being used to fuel a new narrative that focuses on accusations of horse-trading as a means to undermine a democratic process. What is being deliberately ignored is that such allegations need to be proved in a court of law for any action to be taken. They are handy for political sloganeering but cannot be used to counter what is purely a constitutional and legal process.
The government allies have stitched up their agreements with the opposition but according to Red Zone insiders, they will hold back formal announcements till after the OIC foreign ministers’ meeting. Despite the ups and downs of this week and the increase in political temperatures, the PML-Q, MQM and BAP are still locked into an understanding whose final details are being stitched up. One parliamentarian from the allied parties said their decision was intact as per the understanding reached.
One key challenge for the opposition is to keep its members safe, secure and available in Islamabad. This has led to daily congregations for dinners where the leaders keep an eye on their flock while also ensuring that none are under any pressure or facing threats. Opposition insiders say this is harder than it sounds as these elected members have a strong gravitational pull from their constituencies and yet cannot be allowed to disperse from Islamabad at a crucial time when every single vote counts.
While it is clear that the vote of no confidence will take place in a matter of days, there remain some uncertainties that are becoming a source of concern: (i) if PM Khan is on a collision course – as is evident from his speeches, including the one on Sunday – is there a way the system can be saved from instability without the opposition ceding space to him? (ii) Will the establishment be forced to intervene if matters start to spin out of control (iii) what will happen if the PM decides to use the ‘nuclear option’ of firing a senior official and appointing a new one in his place?
Some senior government officials have started to acknowledge in private that their prospects of surviving this challenge from the opposition are slim. They are now also admitting that the root cause of the dire situation they find themselves in today is the unnecessary and avoidable confrontation with the establishment. 
Yet they are now locked into a predicament that can only reinforce itself if the PTI government falls. The narrative being stitched together by the party leadership will likely further accentuate the source of the conflict and could trigger greater political instability.

The Red Zone is under stress. The coming ten days will determine if it can sustain it.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Finding and filling health  gaps digitally,"While various startups addresses a spectrum of challenges, till the net is cast wider and deeper, health tech will not be a...","“A man was having severe heart problems in Loralai, Balochistan,” narrates Dr Sara Saeed Khurram, co-founder of Sehat Kahani. “It was during the peak of the pandemic when the country was under lockdown and access to medical advice, tricky at the best of times in remote areas of Pakistan, had become all the more challenging. But he was able to connect to a doctor through Sehat Kahani and got prescribed the required medicine that helped save his life.”
With a ratio of one doctor for every 1,200 patients, half the population of Pakistan does not have access to basic primary healthcare services. Hand-in-hand is the phenomenon of doctor bahus: women who train medically but for a myriad of reasons are unable to practice in a country that desperately needs more doctors.
Born out of Dr Khurram’s personal experience, Sehat Kahani is a health tech social enterprise that provides a solution to both problems. “I was practicing when I had to shift cities. By chance, I connected to the nurse on duty at my old desk who told me patients were still coming to the clinic but no doctor was available. I started consulting on the phone and eventually got a webcam. Over time the chance encounter evolved into Sehat Kahani,” says Dr Khurram.
Operating through a network of 37 clinics, to date Sehat Kahani has offered 850,000 consultations and employs 7,000 doctors of which 85 per cent are females.

While various startups addresses a spectrum of challenges, till the net is cast wider and deeper, health tech will not be a panacea for all healthcare problems in Pakistan

According to the global health security index 2021, Pakistan is ranked 130 out of 195. From being able to access medical advice to the purchase of genuine medicine to recognising the presence of a disease, there are challenges across the entire process. Digitisation has stepped in to address many of the gaps of which Sehat Kahani is a case in point.
“We have saved six people from committing suicide in Pakistan,” says Syed Naseh, CTO of Saaya Health, a mental health platform. Available in seven languages globally and Urdu, Punjabi, Pashto and Sindhi in Pakistan, Saaya Health has conducted over 4,000 counselling sessions and its social-emotional learning content has reached about 100,000 children.
One in four people in Pakistan suffer from mental health issues. In Karachi, where multi-generational families live in small apartments, one in three suffer from depression and anxiety. And yet, there is a taboo around mental health with those seeking it as perceived to be ‘mad’, explains COO Alizeh Valjee who has a background in psychology.
During the pandemic, relationship issues were exacerbated, increasing domestic violence. The rate of disability and dysfunction increased in those with existing mental health issues along with burnout rates. Stress related to financial insecurities, rise in unemployment and poverty, lack of access to social support and recreational outlets, inability to access the health system during the lockdown and overall anxiety due to uncertainty together made an environment highly conducive to debilitating mental health and holistic wellbeing.
But things are improving, says Mr Naseh. Mental health is becoming less of a taboo, more literature is being produced and more universities are offering psychology cases, he said while giving the example of the recently held Karachi Wellness Festival.
However, all access to healthcare becomes meaningless if the medicines bought to address the illnesses are fake. And Pakistan’s problems with counterfeit drugs is endemic, with some research statistics indicating that 40-50pc of medicine sold are fake.
“We are trying to connect the pharma companies directly to the patient to help eliminate fake medicines from the system,” says Furquan Kidwai, founder and CEO of online pharmacy Dawaai.
There are 500-plus pharmaceutical companies in the country that are manufacturing drugs distributed by 1000-plus distributors through 45,000-plus licensed pharmacies, he explains using numbers to explain how fragmented the market is. This has resulted in the creation of many layers between the pharma company and the end consumer that has allowed one of the biggest counterfeit medicine markets in the world to flourish.
Because of the cryogenic nature of the market, there are about 20,000 unique SKUs (stock-taking units) available for about 500-600 medicines — each medicine is sold under 10-15 different names. “Take Paracetamol as an example. It is sold under 30 different names — Panadol, Paramol, Parasol etc,” he says.
An average shop has say about 200 SKUs so patients have to go through the hassle of visiting multiple pharmacies to get their prescription fulfilled. The pandemic pushed Dawaai’s user adoption rate to 5x-6x, leading to a current growth rate of 9x. 
The health tech numbers are impressive. One source says there are 331 health tech startups in Pakistan, another says telehealth companies grew by 900pc during the pandemic. But this picture is skewed. While various health tech addresses a spectrum of challenges, from menstrual health to setting up appointments with doctors, the ease of access is limited to the relatively affluent that have access to the internet and a basic understanding of technology. Till the net is cast wider and deeper, health tech will not be a panacea for all healthcare problems in Pakistan.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Looking towards the small guy,"There are more than 3,000 Pakistani sellers on Alibaba.com with close to 90pc of them coming from Sialkot","

Mr Song Song, Country Manager, Ali Baba

 
For as long as one can remember, Pakistan has been stuck in a perpetual cycle of boom and busts. Ask any minister, finance bro or stock analyst masquerading as an economist the recipe to break free from this and they will tell you increasing exports is the answer. That’s also something Commerce Advisor Abdul Razak Dawood has made a key priority since the first day. 
One such measure his ministry could claim credit for was getting Pakistan placed on the Amazon’s sellers’ list, which we were told would open new avenues for exports for local entrepreneurs. How many of those businesses, mostly used to business-to-business (B2B )contracts, would actually be able to position themselves in the direct-to-consumer (D2C) segment on arguably the most competitive marketplace on the planet was a different matter altogether. 

There are more than 3,000 Pakistani sellers on Alibaba.com with close to 90pc of them coming from Sialkot

Meanwhile, a few thousand businesses from the country had focused their energies eastward towards Alibaba.com. In fact, Pakistan now ranks the highest in terms of paid sellers on the world’s largest B2B e-commerce platform’s Global Business. Since 2017-18, the number of Pakistani sellers on the platform has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent, according to a presentation the company presented to a roundtable at the Board of Investment’s recent conference. 
“There are more than 3,000 Pakistani sellers on Alibaba.com with close to 90pc of them coming from Sialkot,” says Mr Song Song, the company’s country manager for Pakistan. And now he wants to expand the platform’s reach to traders and businesses in other cities, especially the export-oriented ones like Faisalabad and Gujranwala, in addition to Karachi and Lahore. For that purpose, he and his team have been increasing their outreach efforts through awareness sessions at the various chambers of commerce and industries. 
“Apparel is the most popular category among Pakistani sellers, followed by sports goods and surgical equipment given that the majority of our users are from Sialkot,” he shares. According to the ‘Digital B2B Outlook 2022 Pakistan’ published by Alibaba at the beginning of the year, 63pc of the sellers are in the apparel category while a total of 3.2 million listings have been made from the country so far. But how much does that translate into dollar terms? “Unfortunately even we don’t know the gross merchandise value of goods sold from the country on our platform,” Mr Song Song says. 
That’s strange, isn’t it? Maybe at first. As a B2B e-commerce platform facilitating cross-border trade across hundreds of geographies, Alibaba.com is used by many buyers and sellers for discovery and information before actually negotiating the deal between themselves. “Outside China, the US and Malaysia, the transactions still take place offline so it becomes difficult for us to estimate the worth of goods sold,” the executive explains. 
The reason behind that is, of course, the complicated nature of B2B payments which is made even more complex due to the cross-border nature of transactions. “It’s not like B2C where the average order value would be a few dollars. You are talking hundreds of thousands or even a million dollars per order which the current infrastructure doesn’t allow for in Pakistan. And payments are just one component of it; there’s also fulfilment, integration with customs authorities etc. That entire ecosystem needs to be built,” Mr Song Song says.  
In that case, who else to build the ecosystem other than Alibaba.com — the most successful B2B e-commerce platform? “It requires huge amounts of investments as well as time. In China, it took us around five years to develop it,” he says. Before the company embarks on such an ambitious plan, it first wants to create a local presence and create more awareness among the sellers. 
“We are going to set up a local entity for Alibaba.com, the first such for any of the companies of the Alibaba Group [excluding Daraz and Easypaisa as they were acquisitions], and build an on-ground team in Pakistan for functions like customer service, outreach and marketing by the end of the calendar year,” Mr SongSong shares. This is along with growing their channel partners — currently numbering 10 — who currently act as the e-commerce platform’s representatives in the country and help onboard new users and provide support to the existing ones.

2021-07-27,2022-03-21,Hasty growth in housing finance,The euphoric demand for housing finance and a liberal supply of loans remains subject to ground reality checks.,"Agriculture and housing loans — along with micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) finance — are vital for boosting economic activity. And, if banks start lending more to all the three sectors at the same time, that almost guarantees accelerated GDP growth in the short-to-medium term. 
Currently, though, banks are not wholesomely engaged in such an exercise. But the government and the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) are trying to promote just that. Policies introduced for accelerating housing loans offer an added advantage to the government — they make room for politically-motivated tax amnesty in the name of the documentation of the economy. The ongoing Naya Pakistan Housing Programme (NPHP) is no exception.
Regardless of the fact that this is opening yet another avenue under this programme for the whitening of tax-evaded money, housing loans being offered under NPHP are quite promising. Already, they have reactivated the real estate and building construction sector and continue to enliven demand for outputs of dozens of allied industries and services sub-sectors. Their impact on the overall economy (rebased to 2015-16) is already being felt and is sure to become more and more pronounced with the passage of time. That is if future governments let the programme continue in its current form and spirit.

The euphoric demand for housing finance and liberal supply of loans remains subject to ground reality checks after the expiry of the tax amnesty scheme 

Within seven months of this fiscal year (ie between July 2021 and Jan 2022), banks disbursed fresh consumers loans of Rs47.6 billion for the construction of buildings. In addition to this, they also disbursed Rs11.8bn loans to their employees for the same purpose.
Thus, overall lending for construction of buildings in the first seven months of this fiscal year totalled Rs59.4bn, the latest SBP stats reveal. During the same period of the last fiscal year, total lending for housing buildings was too small — Rs7.9bn for general consumers and Rs22bn for bank employees or a total of Rs29.9bn! 
The demand for housing finance remained strong right from the beginning of this fiscal year partly because builders were using tax-evaded money for launching new housing projects following extension in the tax amnesty scheme. Partly, higher economic growth in 2021-21 compared to that of 2019-20 also motivated people to take advantage of the Naya Pakistan Housing Programme made easier this year — and apply for housing loans. 
So, the volumes of housing finance offered so far could have been larger had banks been able to process loans applications a bit more speedily. The PTI government, challenged on all fronts and struggling for its survival, is pushing banks to their limits through the central bank to accelerate the disbursement of housing loans. So, one can hope that the volumes of fresh housing loans would grow even faster in near future, more so because the “no-question asked” status of the investment coming into this sector has been extended — once again — to the end of FY22 in June.

The overall lending for construction of buildings in the first seven months of this fiscal year totalled Rs59.4bn while during the same period last fiscal year, total lending for housing buildings was Rs7.9bn for general consumers and Rs22bn for bank employees or a total of Rs29.9bn

Growth in housing finance and underlying expansion in construction activities continue to fuel growth in allied sectors as well. During July-Dec 2021, manufacturing of iron and steel grew by 18.4 per cent, whereas in the same period of 2020 this sub-sector of large-scale manufacturing had contracted by 12.1pc, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics. 
Monthly cement production which was below 3.7 million tonnes in July 2021 gradually picked up and peaked at 4.48m tonnes in October before coming down to 4.3m tonnes and 4m tonnes in November and December respectively, due to a dramatic rise in the cost of production of coal-fired cement plants after skyrocketing of coal prices in international markets — and not due to slackness in demand. 
To meet the increasing demand for housing finance, and particularly to meet the demand for low-cost housing, the SBP has now eased prudential regulations of microfinance banks. “The changes made in the prudential regulations include additional guidance on property assessment, mortgage creation and risk management,” the central bank announced on March 16. By end of 2021, total lending already made in the housing sector stood at Rs20bn — the number of beneficiaries was 75,000, an SBP press release said.
Moving forward, accelerated disbursement of housing finance through microfinance banks can be expected to boost volumes of financing and enhance the number of loan takers. But whether microfinance loans for housing can actually lead to the construction of new low-cost housing units is doubtful. These loans are likely to end up for purchasing already constructed flats and one-unit residential units or for the renovation of existing houses and apartments. 
The current euphoric demand for housing finance from commercial banks and an equally liberal supply of housing loans remain subject to ground reality checks after the expiry of the tax amnesty scheme in June. If tax amnesty for investment in the housing sector is allowed to expire on time — and not extended any further — construction of new houses and apartments may come to a halt. But that perhaps doesn’t bother the government. 
Another worrisome aspect of the housing finance euphoria is that banks are offering housing loans to their employees, particularly senior executives, a bit too liberally. The central bank needs to watch mortgage finance to bank employees closely to ward off any possible development of banks-builders nexus. Powerful builders particularly those with strong links with politicians and the establishment have successfully circumvented banking and environmental laws in the past for the construction of prized projects both in Karachi and Islamabad. Some of them still continue to do this. 
While making more housing loans, banks must also focus on ensuring their sustainability in terms of market risks and the risk of defaults.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,The challenges of the electronic warehouse receipt system,"If run professionally and efficiently, it may reduce pressure on farmers to sell their produce in panic immediately ...","The resource-constraint smallholder farmers are unattractive candidates for credit from formal financial institutions, which tend to ignore them because of their often unpredictable, fragmented and unstructured agricultural activities.
The State Bank of Pakistan, like the central banks of many other developing countries, is introducing schemes to increase access of small farmers to the formal credit channels, saving them from exploitation by informal money lenders.
The SBP, in this respect, has recently launched the electronic warehouse receipt (EWR) system for maize crop in Kasur district, almost a year after the scheme was introduced for paddy crop in Hafizabad, another central Punjab district. The EWR enables the depositor, whether a producer or dealer, of an agriculture commodity to use it as collateral for obtaining bank loans or trade in commodity markets, if and when the system is linked with the commodities exchange as well.
If run professionally and efficiently, it may also reduce pressure on farmers to sell their produce in panic immediately after harvests when prices are normally low. Thus, it may ensure a better return to farmers for their financial and physical investment and also help stabilise market prices. The system may also reduce post-harvest losses as care of the stored commodity is handed over to certified warehouses equipped with the required facilities and expertise.

If run professionally and efficiently, it may reduce pressure on farmers to sell their produce in panic immediately after harvests when prices are normally low while allowing agriculture commodities to be used as collateral for bank loans

However, the insufficient number of certified warehouses complying with preservation norms, lack of awareness among farmers and their limited business skills, and no incentives for buyers to purchase commodities from the warehouses are identified as the stumbling blocks in the expansion of the system.
Afaq Tiwana, a progressive farmer, says the EWR may be beneficial for the community only if the SBP scheme includes a blueprint for bridging the infrastructure (warehouses and logistics) gap. “There is an acute shortage of certified warehouses and reliable logistic facilities that are required to run the system satisfactorily.” He advocates for incentivising the infrastructure building by assuring business for the owners of the storage units the whole year so that they are attracted to invest more and more in the sector.
For this purpose, he argues, the government needs to get out of the business of wheat, the biggest crop of the country. The government is the major player in the wheat market but does not utilise private warehouses depriving them of around six-month business, he says. A mix of wheat, rice and maize crops, etc will ensure the warehouses do business throughout the year because of their different seasons. Mr Tiwana says for food security the government may buy grain from the warehouses if and when required through bidding.
Ibad Khan, president of Guava Growers Association, endorses the views saying by opting for the private warehousing system the government may save non-development expenditures worth billions of rupees consumed by thousands of Food Department employees in the name of salaries and perks, operating costs of their vehicles and buildings, etc “without doing any good”.
“The (provincial) government may buy four million tonnes of wheat from the certified warehouses through the Pakistan Commodities Exchange and lift the grain when needed from there. It will equal a surplus of thousands of food department employees and thus save huge funds required for the functioning of the department, as well as the hassle of checking theft of the crop from its storages by unscrupulous staff.”
Mr Khan thinks the farm produce warehousing concept may gain currency provided the farming community is given proper awareness and the purpose is well served easily by engaging the Agriculture Department’s field staff. “If a farmer learns that by spending Rs50, for instance, as storage rent, his produce will earn Rs100 then he will automatically turn towards the EWR scheme. The extension wing of the Agriculture Department is in close proximity to the rural population and may help mobilise them for it.”
An attractive package to build high-quality warehouses can find 15 to 20 investors in each village ready to build the storage if provided information/guidance about the business scope and initial technical assistance in running the facilities until these become self-sufficient, he asserts.
While the functioning of the facility will benefit the farming community in many ways, Mr Tiwana says the prevailing farm produce trade system is built to make the rich richer. “At present 70 to 80 per cent of commodities are sold at harvesting time in the country. And thus, these fetch lower rates for the farmers. Large processors and the influential (textile, feed, flour millers, etc) have huge amounts of cash at hand and make these purchases knowing that the prices will shoot up within months. Besides value-addition through their mills, they also earn a big profit through commodities trade, robbing millions of farmers of the money that actually belongs to them.”
The EWR facility will save the poor farmers from panic selling as well as stabilise prices in the open market at harvesting time because an adequate quantity of the produce would have been deposited with the warehouses, freeing the market from surplus crops. This would ensure a better return even for those farmers who will be opting to sell their produce in the spot market, he adds.
Mr Khan stresses that the warehousing concept must be linked to the Commodities Exchange for the sake of the sustainability of the system and that the Exchange should be relocated to Punjab, the largest producer of agricultural products so that those involved in active farming have easy access to it. He laments that no farmer association was engaged by the SBP or any other government entity to seek their input for the scheme.
For Amer Hayat Bhandara, a progressive grower from Pakpattan, the EWR facility seems to be working only for those farmers and final buyers who are qualified customers of commercial banks. He points out that one of the most common problems of the farmer is informal debt: farmers take loans from people in the market with personal guarantees and with a condition that the crop will be sold through them.
Will the middlemen allow the farmer to go for the EWR, he questions? Suppose if farmers want to do so, then the debt of the middleman will be repaid through EWR, but how will the inputs like seeds, fertilisers, fuel and pesticides for the next crop be acquired?

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Business leaders and sleepless nights,It’s time to lie low as there is no chance of any clarity till the no-confidence move is over.,"


 
THE critical domains of the economy and foreign affairs have taken a back seat as the political leadership has been left to scramble for continuing in power. This seems to be rather dicey in a world that is trying to deal with fragile energy markets and food security in its Covid-battered existence, and global peace in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
In addition to tales of human sufferings, the war has disturbed global commodity markets, disrupted supply chains, hiked freight charges and posed challenges to the global financial system after the West slapped harsh sanctions on Russia and excluded it from the SWIFT system of money transfers. Experts and economists have predicted slower growth and an increase in inflation worldwide.   
Instead of strategising to deal with the evolving global challenges, Islamabad appears to be too busy to care. Global experts have included Pakistan amongst the more vulnerable nations where the impact of the fallout of war is expected to be severe owing to the resource-deficient country’s dependence on oil, gas and edible imports.

It’s time to lie low as there is no chance of any clarity till the no-confidence move is over

Just as the masses are doing, businesses are also watching closely the events unfolding at a bewildering pace under the full glare of the media spotlight. With the final outcome not quite certain, the whole saga is keeping business houses unnerved.
The common man is desperately waiting for the debilitating economic stress to ease off to the extent that it possibly can, while the business class is dreading a hostile reaction of the West to the hard stance of the government towards the US and Europe. The handshake images of Prime Minister Imran Khan and President Putin in Moscow on the day Russia launched its attack on Ukraine has already placed the country in an awkward position. 
Some like to project the current situation in Pakistan as the expected manifestation of civil unrest over inflation and job losses, while others link it to be the outcome of deeper structural imbalance. And then there are those who see the struggle rooted in efforts to uphold the supremacy of civilian leadership. 
Argumentative Pakistanis can debate the politics, but they all agree that the economy and its challenges have taken a back seat for now and things will be difficult irrespective of the final outcome of the no-confidence motion in parliament.
The leading lights of business class, when approached for a comment, were evasive. Afraid to land on the wrong side of the current or the future set of rulers, they shared their disappointment with the political class privately, saying it was frustrating to watch the politicians “stoop too low whenever tested”. 
A senior business leader commented” “Prime Minister Imran Khan and his confidants are inciting violence much like Trump did in the US. How can they not understand the consequences? If politicians fail to resist the temptation to take their conflict out of parliament it can make the country drift towards anarchy. Yes, we are worried for our businesses, but we are more concerned about the safety and security of our family and the future of this country.” 
Musadaq Zulqarnain, of Interloop fame, believed that “irrespective of the outcome of the vote in parliament or the movement on the streets, the economy is not in a good shape. It will get worse because of political turbulence which will be followed by popular measures to please the masses without fundamental corrections. 
“Pakistan needs a sustained growth of 7-8 per cent for several years, powered by an increase in exports if it wants to come out of its economic troubles. The only solution is a consensus document — the Charter of Economy — which must be vigorously followed irrespective of the party in power,” he said.
Nasser Hayat Magoon, former president of the Federation of Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), said the troubles had aggravated in the last couple of years. The budget, he thought, has failed to spark much interest among the legislators. In his opinion, it is influenced by “a select group of businessmen that encircles the leadership”. 
Sources in the Ministry of Finance told Dawn that the budget exercise initiated in January has been in progress at the routine pace. 
Pulling out his wish-list, Mr Magnoon said: “The FPCCI suggested simplification of taxation, which was promised but was resisted by the tax bureaucracy. We do not expect a business-friendly budget. The timing of the budget will be contingent on how the present chaotic political situation settles.” 
He said the private sector needs to communicate with political parties and sensitise them to the variety of problems that are being faced by businesses. He warned that street agitation in the current charged environment may have serious consequences. 
Mian Anjum Nisar, another business leader, lamented the lack of clarity in politics, while Majyd Aziz was critical of mismatched priorities of successive governments. 
Regardless of the concerns voiced by the business community, everybody realises that at least in the short term, there is no chance of any clarity till the no-confidence move is over.

2022-07-27,2022-03-21,Auto parts — setting a new record for imports,New entrants are rolling out vehicles with mere 5pc locally made parts which is insufficient to reduce foreign exchange burden.,"Pakistan’s import bill for completely and semi-knocked down (CKD/SKD) kits for cars imported by local assemblers has crossed one billion dollars in just eight months of 2021-22 which is significantly higher than the record high bill of $1.12 billion for the entire of FY21.
The 8MFY22 ended with $1.102bn as compared to $557 million in the same period last fiscal. 
The low levels of localisation by Chinese and Korean investors under Auto Policy 2016-2021 for five years as well as in the new models by existing assemblers have played a key role in boosting the import bill.
As per data of the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the new and old entrants brought CKD/SKD kits worth $4.987bn from 2016-2017 to July-February 2021-2022, thus nullifying claims of achieving higher localisation.
Sources said that the new entrants have started rolling out vehicles from their assembly lines with a mere five per cent locally made parts which is insufficient to reduce the burden on the foreign exchange. 

New entrants are rolling out vehicles with mere five per cent locally made parts which is insufficient to reduce the burden on the foreign exchange rate

Assemblers are now in top gear as the eight months of FY22 ended with a whooping sales jump of 57.5pc in cars to 149,813 units. They are also excited over huge bookings in hands whose delivery time ranges between three months to 11 months. Jeeps and pickups sales have also surged by 51.5pc in 8MFY22 to 28,437 units.
Huge demand for cars has led to a massive jump in CKD/SKD imports to $1.120bn in FY21 from $478mn in FY20, up by 134pc thanks to low-interest rates and attractive auto financing by the banks till the third quarter of 2021
However, curbs on auto financing from the last quarter of 2021, persistent increase in car prices and long delays in delivery appear to have not hurt the buyers’ sentiments in the last eight months, while buyers are also satisfied over the rising resale value of the vehicles owing to months’ long delivery timings, soaring prices and on-money for vehicles for immediate delivery. 
The import bill of CKD/SKD was $660m in FY17 which later swelled to $809m in FY18 and then remained at $818mn in FY19. The fiscal year 2019-2020 was a bad year for the entire country due to the flare-up in Covid-19 from March to June followed by the government’s decision to close down the industrial units in April 2020. As a result, the FY20 import bill of CKD/SKD was just $478m.
Stakeholders had been trumpeting 70pc localisation in Suzuki Mehran which ruled the roads for over 30 years without significant model change. After the end of the iconic Mehran journey in 2018, the claim of achieving higher localisation by stakeholders has now been confined to 55-60pc in various existing Japanese models and 35-45pc in new models. 
It seems that no serious efforts have been made by the existing Japanese assemblers in the old and new models to improve the utilisation levels  of locally made parts in vehicles.
A vendor, who asked not to be named, said the import bill of CKD/SKD would remain under pressure as the new entrants, who had approved their projects under the Auto Policy 2016-2021, would enjoy a honeymoon period for the next four to five years to keep rolling out vehicles with negligible local content. Besides, new models by the existing Japanese assemblers will also take time in improving local content in the vehicles.
He said vendors had asked the government not to allow vehicles’ assembly of higher engine power under tAuto Policy 2016-2021. The new entrants, instead of introducing small cars below 800cc, shifted their focus towards the assembly of high engine power sports utility vehicles (SUV) whose numbers are growing every day.
Chief Operating Officer, Balochistan Wheel Limited (BWL), Muhammad Irfan Ghani in a letter to the CEO Engineering Development Board (EDB) said the EDB is the custodian of the auto vending industry which encourages the localisation of auto parts.
The auto sector in Pakistan is now more than 50 years old but the assemblers have not done localisation seriously, he complained.
He said the pace of localisation of auto parts is too slow due to the discouraging attitudes and lengthy procedures adopted by the assemblers which form a monopoly for their foreign principals. They protect their own interests to use their CKD parts and have made localisation very  difficult. 
Mr Ghani said the country’s precious foreign exchange is being wasted due to non-localisation while many assemblers are not taking parts from the local vendors in some of their newly launched models.
The matter came up for discussion during the first meeting of the Auto Industry Development and Export Committee (AIDEC) held on March 8, 2022, which was attended by the auto stakeholders and officials of the relevant ministries. The AIDEC meeting had decided that the EDB would schedule a joint meeting between Baluchistan Wheels and Pak Suzuki to resolve the matter.
However, AIDEC committee members reiterated that the localisation of parts and components must be pursued in letter and spirit. 
Former Chairman Pakistan Association of Parts and Accessories Manufacturers (Paapam), Abdul Rahman Aizaz attributed the rising import bill of CKD to the massive revival in sales of cars and SUVs from the depressed sales scenario of 2019-2020.
Under Auto Policy 2016-2021, most of the new entrants have focused on manufacturing SUVs, which too has resulted in the higher value of CKD imports. He said that sales volumes of new entrants and old players have shown phenomenal growth due to improving economic indicators.
Since the new entrants under Auto Policy 2016-21 can avail the concession on import of CKD for five years, localisation of parts in such vehicles, especially of SUVs, is in the catching-up phase, he added.
Mr Aizaz said that the unprecedented surge in international prices of various resins and metals, rupee devaluation against the dollar and multiple times higher freight charges have further enhanced the landed cost of almost all raw materials.

2022-02-27,2022-03-21,Surviving tough times,"Regardless of who wins and who loses the no-trust motion, the government will not find it easy to handle the economy.","The rupee hit its lowest ever of over 180 to a dollar in the interbank market on the weekend as the shares market continues to decline. 
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) appears largely satisfied with the PTI government’s explanation of the Rs346 billion relief package announced late last month in an apparent attempt to appease the inflation-stricken households. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) kept the key policy rate unchanged at 9.75 per cent but its warning that it could advance the next Monetary Policy Committee meeting to raise the interest rates if need be has pushed cut-off yields in the last public sector debt auction.
The political instability in the wake of a no-confidence motion submitted by the opposition to oust the prime minister is forcing the government to take populist measures that it might not have if it weren’t facing the existential threat from the opposition political parties that have come together to push Imran Khan out of power in spite of their deep divisions. 

Regardless of who wins and who loses the no-trust motion, the government will not find it easy to handle the economy — many hard decisions will have to be made

No one expected the Kaptaan to go away without fighting till the last ball, but the last week’s events in Islamabad have spawned fears of violence. The storming of the Parliament Lodges, where the opposition lawmakers were housed by police commandos and counter-terrorism force was followed by the attack of the PTI workers on Sindh House in Islamabad. It happened after the opposition gave media access to the place to interview dissident parliamentarians of the ruling party. 
The ruling party’s insistence to gather a million people outside the parliament in the event of the vote on the no-confidence resolution and the threats being tossed around by the ministers has forced the opposition political parties to make their own plans to counter the move. Indeed, everyone expected the prime minister to fight back — but not in this way. 
The situation is fluid and may likely continue for several weeks to come, with its impact expected to reverberate for many months. Regardless of who wins and who loses the no-trust motion, the government will not find it easy to handle the economy. Many tough decisions will have to be made. If the opposition succeeds in de-seating the prime minister, it will have its work cut out for them. 
The first job would be to approach the IMF to release the next tranche to shore up foreign exchange reserves and take the pressure off the home currency. PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has already hinted at renegotiating the deal with the multilateral lender. It is not clear if the Washington-based fund would be more kind to the new government than the Imran Khan administration. 
The second job, the businessmen interviewed by telephone over the weekend say, for whoever — the PTI or the opposition parties — is in power after the vote on the motion would be to mend Pakistan’s relationship with the West, especially the United States. “That does not necessarily mean that we have to dial down our ties with China. Going to Russia when the Kremlin had planned to attack Ukraine was a big foreign policy mistake Imran Khan made. He could have called off the tour and stayed neutral. That would not have brought upon us such pressure from the European Union and the US, with which our relations are already facing problems due to the Taleban takeover of Kabul last summer,” a textile exporter argued. 
“Improvement in our ties with Washington and European capitals is crucial not only for securing some concessions from the IMF but also to get out of the grey list of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).”
A senior executive of a chemical company was of the view that once politics cool down Islamabad will have to reconsider its policy towards India. “If you think you can improve your relationship with the West and get off the FATF’s enhanced monitoring regime without making some kind of headway with New Delhi, you are totally mistaken. I have information that our present military leadership too is in favour of resuming ties with India,” he claimed.
However, there are others who feel that the top priority has to be given to the resolution of domestic political problems. “The settlement of the outstanding issues with the IMF and the western powers is important. But more important is to tackle our domestic problems first. I cannot say if the present government will be in power after a few days or not. But in my opinion, once this crisis is over, all the parties must sit together and develop a consensus on electoral reforms so that we can have political stability. I think that the government term of five years should be curtailed to four years. We are very impatient people and a kind of fatigue starts to take over us every three to four years. If we manage to clean up our political mess, we will be able to put back the economy on the rails and end our international isolation.”

2022-03-20,2022-03-21,"IMF seeks details of petrol, power subsidy funding",Finance minister makes it clear there are no more outstanding issues as the IMF only wants to ascertain sources of funding.,"


 
ISLAMABAD: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has sought copies of financial agreements with the provincial governments and other details from the federal government to confirm the financing of discounts on electricity and petroleum products announced by Prime Minister Imran Khan, Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin disclosed at a press conference on Sunday.
The talks with the IMF were earlier scheduled to conclude on Friday last but then “they [Fund staff] wanted to see agreements with the provinces to basically reassure we are not involved in aerial firing” on financing of PM’s relief package for petroleum prices, the minister said.
Mr Tarin made it clear that there were no more outstanding issues, as they only wanted to ascertain the sources of funding to cover the cost of reduction in electricity and petroleum products. They were assured the package would be covered through provincial shares and dividends of the state-owned entities, he said. “They said show us agreements with the provinces,” he remarked.
The federal government has signed rolling memorandums of understanding with the provinces to provide cash surplus every year to show lower consolidated fiscal deficit but are sometimes remain unhonoured when provinces also go into overdrafts.
“So there is no problem. We already have agreements that we will show them” when the two sides would meet again on Monday, the minister said, adding he would hold a final policy round up with the fund mission on Tuesday. 
The two sides will then finalise the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) amicably and take it to the executive board on a convenient date.
After initial compliance with the commitments made with the IMF in December 2021 to increase petroleum levy and power tariff, PM Khan reversed the progress by announcing Rs10 per litre reduction in petroleum products bringing down levy to zero besides a cut in electricity rates by Rs5 per unit instead of a schedule of increases agreed to with the IMF to address circular debt.
Up to 700,000-tonne wheat import
Responding to a question, Mr Tarin said all the provinces were part of the minimum wheat support price at Rs2,200 per 40 kg approved by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet last week — about 13 per cent higher than Rs1,950 of last year and showed confidence to exceed procurement target that was also set at 6.9 million tonnes last week.
He said the wheat production was then estimated to be 5pc to 6pc higher and may not require imports except 500,000 to 700,000 tonnes for strategic reserves. “I would like to increase strategic reserves from 1.8 million tonnes to two million tonnes, depending on international prices,” he said, adding he would not burn foreign exchange if international wheat prices remain higher.
In response to a question about former PML-N finance minister Miftah Ismail’s statement that the country could not launch international bonds as Pakistan’s bond yields had gone high due to economic policies and fundamentals, Mr Tarin said his statement would not change ground reality. This was not Pakistan specific but with entire developing countries including Turkey, Indonesia and others, he remarked.
Mr Tarin said financing was not an issue but the interest rates being offered were higher. He said he still had $4-5bn worth of offers from banks, but “why should I take expensive loans?” Mr Miftah should also recall they had left the government with just one-month import financing that now stood at $16.6bn – against average monthly imports of about $7bn in eight months, he added.
Responding to a question whether he would continue as finance minister in the next government if asked, Mr Tarin said he was a man of principles and would at no cost do that as he was a PTI senator. “I will remain finance minister if the PTI government stays, otherwise will go home. I am not a renegade,” he said.
He expressed the hope that 5pc economic growth rate was expected despite various headwinds this year, as some sectors were also showing robust growth including large-scale manufacturing, agriculture and exports. “This shows there is thrust in the economy and momentum is returning,” he said, adding that this did not mean there were no headwinds but policy adjustments would continue to absorb them.
“The welcome news is that the LSM has grown by 8.2pc in January against same month of last year and 4.2pc against December 2021,” he said, adding the LSM growth had slowed down in August and September 2021 but the trend had reversed. “Our economic growth momentum has picked up again as all agriculture crops are growing at 6 to 12 percent, and exports and services sectors are also growing at a high pace,” the minister pointed out.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,NA speaker summons no-trust session on 25th,"Government to file reference in SC today to end politics of ""sale and purchase"".","ISLAMABAD: In an apparent move to prolong the voting on a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan, National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser on Sunday summoned the session of the lower house of parliament on March 25, violating the Constitution under which he is bound to convene a session within 14 days after the submission of a requisition. 
Meanwhile, the government also took a significant decision under which it will file a reference in the Supreme Court on Monday (today), seeking “an opinion” of the apex court on two main points — whether the disqualification of a legislator is for life time and whether the dissident MNAs of any party can cast vote on a no-confidence resolution. 
The speaker, who under the Constitution was bound to call the NA session by March 21 [within 14 days after the opposition’s requisition], gave an excuse that since the three-day conference of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) would be held in the NA hall, there was no other place in the federal capital to convene the NA session. 
This is despite the fact that the capital offers alternative locations where such an event can be held such as the spacious Jinnah Convention Centre, Prime Minister Secretariat, Pak-China Centre, two five-star hotels, etc. 

Government to file reference in SC today to end politics of ‘sale and purchase’

The opposition lashed out at the speaker for his decision to hold the NA session on March 25, saying he had violated the Constitution to prolong the voting on no-trust motion. 
Sources in the government told Dawn that the decisions to hold the NA session on March 25 and filing of the reference in the Supreme Court were taken at a meeting presided over by Prime Minister Khan at his Banigala residence on Sunday. 
Speaker Asad Qaiser issued an order saying the [opposition’s] requisition was received on March 8 for summoning the National Assembly. Whereas, on Jan 21, 2022, a motion had been adopted by the NA to allow the exclusive use of NA chamber for the 48th session of the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers scheduled for March 22, 23 or any other date. 
He said the renovation work on the NA chamber and its lobbies had commenced on the requirement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the end of February 2022, which was under taken by the Capital Development Authority. 
The speaker said that after the receipt of [the opposition’s] requisition, the NA Secretariat requested the Senate Secretariat to provide chamber of the Senate for holding the NA session, but the latter pointed out that the Senate chamber was also not available for being under renovation. 
“Thereafter, the CDA chairman and deputy commissioner, Islamabad, were also approached to arrange and provide a suitable building for holding the session of the National Assembly outside the parliament building, at Islamabad. However, they have informed in writing that no suitable place is available at present in Islamabad for holding the NA session,” Mr Qaisar added. 
“In view of the aforementioned facts and circumstances, it is evident that no suitable place would be available for holding the session of the NA till March 24. Having no adequate option available whatsoever, for holding of the NA session before March 24, therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under clause (3) of Article 54 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, read with Article 254 of the Constitution, I hereby summon the session of the National Assembly on the first available date i.e. Friday, March 25 at 11.00am at the Parliament House, Islamabad,” the order said. 
Meanwhile, Planning and Development Minister Asad Umar said in a tweet that the government would file a reference in the Supreme Court that would end the politics of “sell and purchase” and diminish the influence of “easy money” and “influence in politics”. 



 
When contacted, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said the decision to file the reference was taken by the prime minister in a meeting on Sunday. “The basic reasons of filing the reference are — to know whether the disqualification of any legislators is for lifetime and that can PTI dissidents cast vote on the no-trust motion,” he added. 
A source said the NA speaker could call the session on March 21 to meet the constitutional requirement [within 14 days after the requisition] and adjourn the session for three days for the OIC conference and it could resume on March 24. 
According to Article 63 of the Constitution, the prime minister is given three days after the tabling of a no-trust motion, for preparation. However, the government is apparently trying to linger on the voting on the motion — first by an excuse of “lack of suitable place for the session till March 25” and then filing of the reference in the Supreme Court. 
The information minister said the government was only seeking an opinion of the apex court and it could be given by the court even on the first day of filing of the reference or the court could take more time it deemed appropriate. 
Asked why the NA session was not called on March 21, he said the NA hall was not available for the session due to the OIC summit.

Speaking at a news conference, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari expressed the hope that the Supreme Court would take notice of the violation of the Constitution by the speaker, proving that there was at least one institution in the country for the protection of the Constitution, democracy and right of the vote of the parliamentarians. 
Stating that the job of the SC was to protect and implement the Constitution, the PPP chairman hoped that the court “will not facilitate this government on its unconstitutional step” and that it would make a constitutional decision, not a political one. 

PTI accused of running social media campaign against army; PML-Q wants PM to take notice of ‘anti-Pakistan’ drive

“We appreciate how the SC sent a message of standing with the law and Constitution, even on a weekend,” he said in an apparent reference to the hearing of a petition of the Supreme Court Bar Association during which the court had reprimanded the government over the attack by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) activists on Sindh House. 
He said the SC was already hearing a petition that had not been filed by them, but the bar association. However, he said the court had issued notices to the political parties as well in the case and they would present their viewpoint before it. 
“This coward captain [the PM] is running away from the vote of no confidence. He is escaping to the extent that he has made the speaker abrogate the Constitution,” the PPP chairman observed. 
Mr Bhutto-Zardari lashed out at PM Khan for using Islam for party politics and asked him not to use the slogan of Madinah state. 
“You (the PM) are the foreign-sponsored and foreign-funded agent who has been planted in our system,” he said while criticising the government’s foreign policy. He alleged that the prime minister had been given the task to damage the country’s foreign policy and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and that he had done it “beautifully”. 
He accused Mr Khan of adopting the foreign policy of India, stating that there was no difference in the foreign policies of the two countries. 
Addressing a separate news conference, PML-N’s senior vice-president Shahid Khaqan Abbasi also accused the speaker and the premier of violating the Constitution and committing treason under Article 6 which, he said, was not a joke. He said if anyone would interfere in the democratic process of no-trust move, he would commit ‘treason’. 
PML-N secretary general Ahsan Iqbal alleged that Mr Khan was using religion card to cover up his “dirty politics and incompetence”. 
Earlier, in a statement, PML-N information secretary Marriyum Aurangzeb stated if the speaker failed to convene the NA session before March 22, he would be guilty of violating the Constitution that was be punishable under Article 6. 
Campaign against institutions
During the news conference, the PPP chairman also alleged that the PM and his social media team had launched a ‘propaganda campaign’ to ‘provoke’ an institution so that it could not remain ‘neutral’. 
“When a time has come when the media is talking about a neutral environment, Imran and his social media team are trying to spread the propaganda that institutions are not neutral, be it through provocation or creating a constitutional crisis,” he said.
“It is the responsibility of all of us to demand and try for every institution to work within its domain drawn by the law and Constitution, and to criticise when this does not happen. However, it is also our responsibility to oppose the prime minister, his social media team and its members who are provoking and targeting an institution under a conspiracy,” he added.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari said the prime minister had equated the term ‘neutral’ with animals and had still not apologised to the nation over it. “Our efforts have always been for neutrality. The PM, his social media team and ministers are making desperate attempts to tarnish neutrality. We condemn this,” he said without elaborating.
The PPP chairman, who had not named the institution during his press conference, later asked the Inter-Service Public Relations and the judiciary to take notice of the propaganda campaign by the PM, his social media team and the MNAs aimed at getting “the status of neutrality” changed.
Though Mr Bhutto-Zardari did not give any reference to the army when he talked about the allegation regarding the propaganda campaign against neutrality, the PML-Q and the PML-N came out more openly when they castigated the PTI government for hitting out at army and Inter-Service Intelligence by a party’s woman MNA and an important member of the PTI’s media team. 
A video clip with the audio of PTI MNA Kanwal Shauzeb shared from a twitter space “Current political situation” went viral on social media in which she could be heard apparently talking about military establishment. “They have nothing to do with performance and neither they want to manage the country. They had never done it in the past, then why will they do it now. Actually, they wanted to hijack the system and working on an agenda of minus-Imran Khan,” she said in the clip, adding that the real issue was that the premier was not allowing those sitting in “different institutions and all kinds of institutions to continue their loot and plunder” and “that’s why they are now having panic attacks”.
Since Saturday afternoon, an unusual debate has started on Twitter with a host of people, apparently the PTI supporters, trying to make the army leadership controversial by levelling all kinds of accusations. They were found accusing the army chief of trying to undermine the government and the present system. 
In response, several people also came out in support of the armed forces, blaming the present government of maligning the armed forces and its chief.
Reacting over the clip, PML-Q MNA Chaudhry Salik Hussain tweeted: “The PTI’s social media team and a woman MNA levelled false allegations on the Pakistan Army and the ISI, which are unacceptable and unbearable.” 
Mr Hussain demanded that the PM must take notice of this “dirty anti-Pakistan campaign, otherwise, the PML-Q knew well how to deal with the anti-Pakistan elements”.



 
Also, the official spokesman for PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif, Malik Ahmad Khan, tweeted that the PTI social media team would not be allowed to defame the Pakistan Army. “The state’s existence gets threatened when a state army’s central authority is compromised,” he said. 



 
“When a state will not respect the status of the institution of army, can a state survive?” he asked in a linked tweet. “The strong army is a guarantor of strong Pakistan,” the spokesman said, adding that every Pakistani was ready to sacrifice his life for country’s solidarity and progress.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Jahangir Tareen group sees their demands being met,A senior party leader in Punjab says the PM has agreed to remove CM Buzdar but wants the dissident group to wait for a while.,"LAHORE: Members of the dissident Jahangir Tareen group in the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) appear confident they will have their way after securing guarantees that the chief minister of Punjab will be removed from office.
Sources in the group told Dawn that Prime Minister Imran Khan had all but “agreed” to accept the demands of the dissident group, but has sought more time to remove Chief Minister Usman Buzdar in order to “avert the impression of being blackmailed”.
Shaken by a no-confidence motion against the premier, the PTI government is on a mission to mend ways with party dissidents. A senior delegation of government members met the Jahangir Tareen group and asked them to explain their concerns and demands in detail.
“The Tareen group remains adamant over the removal of Usman Buzdar and explained their concerns with regards to victimisation, lukewarm response from Chief Minister Office to their problems and the bureaucracy’s attitude towards their group members,” a source in the Tareen group told Dawn.
A senior party leader in Punjab told Dawn the prime minister had agreed to remove CM Buzdar but wanted the dissident group to wait for a while, because an immediate acceptance of the demand would be exploited by the opposition as if “Imran Khan has bowed down to dissidents’ blackmail”.
The PTI government had also conveyed that the new chief minister would be from PTI parliamentarians, the senior party leader said, adding that the Tareen group assured the government team that it did not want to leave the party until it would be compelled to do so.
Problems being resolved
Meanwhile, key Tareen group member Lala Tahir Randhawa said a government team led by cabinet minister Murad Raas had called on the group and agreed to resolve problems that could be addressed through the administration.
Since the government team had been given two days to resolve the parliamentarians’ issue, Mr Randhawa said a response had started to come, as deputy commissioners, district police officers and other government officials were calling all group members to address their problems.
He said that actions taken to victimise him and provincial minister Ajmal Cheema were also being undone. “The government team will return with its problems’ resolution report and the group will meet on Wednesday to take a final decision,” he added.
Mr Randhawa asserted that the group’s main demand was “minus-Buzdar” because the incumbent chief minister had ruined the governance system in the country. “Another large group of MPAs have also contacted the Tareen group and expressed support for its demand of removing Buzdar from Punjab’s chief ministership,” Mr Randhawa revealed.
Answering a question about PTI dissident and former senior minister Abdul Aleem Khan’s conduct with the group after visiting it at Jahangir Tareen’s residence, Mr Randhawa said Aleem Khan did come and a five-member committee was constituted — including Mr Randhawa, Nauman Langrial, Abdul Hayee Dasti and Ajmal Cheema — to coordinate with Aleem Khan. However, Aleem Khan did not call the committee and he alone met Sindh Governor Imran Ismail, who visited him on the instructions of the prime minister.
Sources said the government had conveyed to the Tareen group that CM Buzdar would be replaced by another senior leader within the party and four names have started doing the rounds in the PTI parliamentarians’ circle, including those of provincial minister Raja Yasir Humayun, Murad Raas, Mian Aslam Iqbal and Asif Nakai.
Tareen group members told Dawn that 13 of their 17 MPAs were elected as independents and later joined the party. “Even if the Tareen group decided to vote against PM Imran Khan in the centre and CM Buzdar in Punjab, the government would not be able to de-seat them because they were not elected on PTI tickets,” Mr Randhawa told Dawn.
Tareen ‘held party together’
Meanwhile, Jahangir Tareen’s spokesman Awn Chaudhry said some eight MNAs were standing with the group and take a decision about supporting or not supporting the government in the opposition’s no-confidence motion.
“I was personally disturbed when I saw that several MNAs stood against the party,” he said and added that it all happened because PM Khan pushed away Jahangir Tareen, who was actually keeping all MNAs intact with the party.
“Mr Tareen used to help the prime minister in difficult times and resolve party parliamentarians’ problems,” he said and asked whether the PTI should not hold the premier’s political aides accountable for all this mess.
Answering a question whether Jahangir Tareen could enter into any deal with the PML-N, he said he could not comment on his leader’s behalf. “Whatever Jahangir Tareen will decide, his whole group will go along his decision,” he asserted.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,RED ZONE FILES: All set for a collision course,Some govt officials have started to acknowledge in private that prospects of surviving this challenge from opposition are slim.,"Political entanglements may once again be headed to the courts. 
Speaker Asad Qaiser has summoned the crucial session of the National Assembly on Friday, March 25, which is three days longer than the Constitution has stipulated once the required number of parliamentarians have requisitioned a session. This order further complicates a situation that is fraught with danger and uncertainty. Here’s where things stand today and what they could portend in the coming days:

The PTI government is doing legal gymnastics with constitutional procedures, but there is no way around the vote of no-confidence against Prime Minister Imran Khan. The only way that the PM can retain his job is if the opposition fails to muster a strength of 172 in the lower house during the vote. Or if for some reason, the opposition withdraws the motion. There is no other way out for the PM and his cabinet. Legal experts say the speaker may attempt to delay the process and push the vote forward, and this may ultimately end up in courts, but the vote will need to take place one way or another. What matters is the numbers game. Everything else is a side show.
The courts may in fact become the battleground before the real battle on the floor of the National Assembly. If both the government and the opposition head to the Supreme Court with their petitions, the court may need to pronounce on the following: (i) if Article 63 of the constitution allows the party head to stop errant members of his party from voting on the confidence motion (ii) if the disqualification under Article 3 for members indulging in floor crossing can be a lifetime ban (iii) if the speaker can delay summoning of the National Assembly for more than the two-week limit spelt out in the Constitution and whether he can somehow delay the moving of the motion for the vote of no confidence. 
These issues will be addressed by the Supreme Court this week and a lot will depend on how long the SC takes to pronounce a decision. According to legal experts, if the SC reaffirms the obvious interpretation of the constitutional procedure for the vote of no-confidence, then the government will have no other option but to fight the numbers game, which it appears to be losing at this stage.
The planned rallies by the government and the opposition on Sunday, March 27, have added an explosive element to the volatile situation. Inside the Red Zone, there is a genuine fear that if these rallies are allowed to take place as scheduled, then there is a danger of violence breaking out. Now, imagine the real danger: when such violence ensues between a sitting government and its opponents, what does the police do? And if the police cannot handle such a scenario, the only option is what Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid has been referring to in his speeches: handing over security responsibility to the armed forces.
There is no need for the situation to deteriorate to such a level. But it is being dragged towards such an outcome by the government itself. What is otherwise a straightforward constitutional procedure is being weaponised by the use of mobs and threats. These in turn are being used to fuel a new narrative that focuses on accusations of horse-trading as a means to undermine a democratic process. What is being deliberately ignored is that such allegations need to be proved in a court of law for any action to be taken. They are handy for political sloganeering but cannot be used to counter what is purely a constitutional and legal process.
The government allies have stitched up their agreements with the opposition but according to Red Zone insiders, they will hold back formal announcements till after the OIC foreign ministers’ meeting. Despite the ups and downs of this week and the increase in political temperatures, the PML-Q, MQM and BAP are still locked into an understanding whose final details are being stitched up. One parliamentarian from the allied parties said their decision was intact as per the understanding reached.
One key challenge for the opposition is to keep its members safe, secure and available in Islamabad. This has led to daily congregations for dinners where the leaders keep an eye on their flock while also ensuring that none are under any pressure or facing threats. Opposition insiders say this is harder than it sounds as these elected members have a strong gravitational pull from their constituencies and yet cannot be allowed to disperse from Islamabad at a crucial time when every single vote counts.
While it is clear that the vote of no confidence will take place in a matter of days, there remain some uncertainties that are becoming a source of concern: (i) if PM Khan is on a collision course – as is evident from his speeches, including the one on Sunday – is there a way the system can be saved from instability without the opposition ceding space to him? (ii) Will the establishment be forced to intervene if matters start to spin out of control (iii) what will happen if the PM decides to use the ‘nuclear option’ of firing a senior official and appointing a new one in his place?
Some senior government officials have started to acknowledge in private that their prospects of surviving this challenge from the opposition are slim. They are now also admitting that the root cause of the dire situation they find themselves in today is the unnecessary and avoidable confrontation with the establishment. 
Yet they are now locked into a predicament that can only reinforce itself if the PTI government falls. The narrative being stitched together by the party leadership will likely further accentuate the source of the conflict and could trigger greater political instability.

The Red Zone is under stress. The coming ten days will determine if it can sustain it.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Cases of femicide rising sharply in Iraqi Kurdistan,11 women were killed in the first two months of this year...,"SULAIMANIYAH: A woman burned alive by her husband, others shot dead by a father or a teenage brother — bloody violence against women has spiked in northern Iraq’s Kurdish region.
The autonomous area, keen on projecting an image of a relative haven of stability and tolerance in war-battered Iraq, has seen a sharp rise in femicide, killings motivated by gender.
“In the past two months, there has been an increase in femicide compared to the previous year,” said Hiwa Karim Jwamir of the Kurdish General Directorate for Combating Violence Against Women.
In the first two months of 2022, 11 women were killed in autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan, most of them shot, said the official based in Sulaimaniyah.
Forty-five women were killed in 2021, up from 25 the previous year, said Jwamir.

11 women were killed in the first two months of this year

On a Friday before dawn, a 15-year-old teenager was fatally wounded by six bullets fired by her father in the village of Soran. The man told police his daughter “went out with two boys late at night”, according to a domestic violence unit which also records so-called “honour killings”.
Across Iraq, gender-based violence rose 125 per cent to over 22,000 cases between 2020 and 2021, says the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund, which has also pointed to “a worrisome increase in depression and suicide among women and girls”. Last December, a 16-year-old girl was disfigured with acid in Baghdad by an adult who wanted to marry her but had been rejected.
For years, activists have denounced violence against women and forced marriages in Iraq, which remains a conservative and patriarchal society.
“Cases of violence against women are on the rise,” said long-time Kurdistan activist Bahar Munzir, director of local group the People’s Development Organisation.
“Most of the women who are killed are victims of a family member.”
A few days before International Women’s Day on March 8, the body of a 20-year-old woman was found on the side of the road in Arbil, the capital of Kurdistan.
Maria Sami, the victim, was known on social networks for her feminist speeches.
The following day, on March 9, Kirkuk police announced the arrest of the killer, her 18-year-old brother.
While he was still on the run, he spoke by phone to a Kurdish television channel and tried to justify the killing by charging his sister had failed to obey the family. In February, mother-of-two Shinyar Huner Rafiq died in hospital, five days after being admitted with serious burns.
“Her husband had come home one evening in a state of intoxication,” Shinyar’s father, Huner Rafiq, told AFP.
“He doused her body in gasoline and set it on fire.” After the father reported the killing, police arrested the husband. “Before dying, Shinyar told us the facts,” said the bereaved father. “We recorded it, and we submitted the video to the investigators.”
Kurdistan’s prime minister Masrour Barzani denounced the “horrific case”, saying he was “deeply troubled” by the spate of violent attacks against women.
The government must impose “the heaviest possible penalty on perpetrators”, he said in a statement.
“There is no honour in honour killings. I’m determined to protect every woman, girl and child from abuse ... This scourge must end.”
In early February, Dohuk police said they had found the corpse of Doski Azad, a 23-year-old transgender woman who had been ostracised by family members.
An arrest warrant was issued to find the suspected murderer: the victim’s brother, who had in recent years been living in Europe.
He had called his family to inform them of his crime and of where the body was, according to police.
The murder was condemned by the UN mission in Iraq, and the consulates of Western countries in Arbil.
The news provoked a torrent of hatred online — against the victim, even though some voices defended minorities’ rights.
In June 2011, Kurdistan passed a law criminalising domestic violence and female genital mutilation.
The law, which threatens life in prison for “honour” crimes, was hailed by non-governmental groups as a major step forward. But the law’s enforcement is hampered by a climate of impunity and a common fear of speaking out.
“When a woman is killed, the procedures of the security services are not the same as when it’s a man, the trial is not the same,” said Munzir, the activist.
“Some cases don’t even make it to court. They are subject to tribal resolution between the man’s family and that of his wife, the victim.“

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Finding and filling health  gaps digitally,"While various startups addresses a spectrum of challenges, till the net is cast wider and deeper, health tech will not be a...","“A man was having severe heart problems in Loralai, Balochistan,” narrates Dr Sara Saeed Khurram, co-founder of Sehat Kahani. “It was during the peak of the pandemic when the country was under lockdown and access to medical advice, tricky at the best of times in remote areas of Pakistan, had become all the more challenging. But he was able to connect to a doctor through Sehat Kahani and got prescribed the required medicine that helped save his life.”
With a ratio of one doctor for every 1,200 patients, half the population of Pakistan does not have access to basic primary healthcare services. Hand-in-hand is the phenomenon of doctor bahus: women who train medically but for a myriad of reasons are unable to practice in a country that desperately needs more doctors.
Born out of Dr Khurram’s personal experience, Sehat Kahani is a health tech social enterprise that provides a solution to both problems. “I was practicing when I had to shift cities. By chance, I connected to the nurse on duty at my old desk who told me patients were still coming to the clinic but no doctor was available. I started consulting on the phone and eventually got a webcam. Over time the chance encounter evolved into Sehat Kahani,” says Dr Khurram.
Operating through a network of 37 clinics, to date Sehat Kahani has offered 850,000 consultations and employs 7,000 doctors of which 85 per cent are females.

While various startups addresses a spectrum of challenges, till the net is cast wider and deeper, health tech will not be a panacea for all healthcare problems in Pakistan

According to the global health security index 2021, Pakistan is ranked 130 out of 195. From being able to access medical advice to the purchase of genuine medicine to recognising the presence of a disease, there are challenges across the entire process. Digitisation has stepped in to address many of the gaps of which Sehat Kahani is a case in point.
“We have saved six people from committing suicide in Pakistan,” says Syed Naseh, CTO of Saaya Health, a mental health platform. Available in seven languages globally and Urdu, Punjabi, Pashto and Sindhi in Pakistan, Saaya Health has conducted over 4,000 counselling sessions and its social-emotional learning content has reached about 100,000 children.
One in four people in Pakistan suffer from mental health issues. In Karachi, where multi-generational families live in small apartments, one in three suffer from depression and anxiety. And yet, there is a taboo around mental health with those seeking it as perceived to be ‘mad’, explains COO Alizeh Valjee who has a background in psychology.
During the pandemic, relationship issues were exacerbated, increasing domestic violence. The rate of disability and dysfunction increased in those with existing mental health issues along with burnout rates. Stress related to financial insecurities, rise in unemployment and poverty, lack of access to social support and recreational outlets, inability to access the health system during the lockdown and overall anxiety due to uncertainty together made an environment highly conducive to debilitating mental health and holistic wellbeing.
But things are improving, says Mr Naseh. Mental health is becoming less of a taboo, more literature is being produced and more universities are offering psychology cases, he said while giving the example of the recently held Karachi Wellness Festival.
However, all access to healthcare becomes meaningless if the medicines bought to address the illnesses are fake. And Pakistan’s problems with counterfeit drugs is endemic, with some research statistics indicating that 40-50pc of medicine sold are fake.
“We are trying to connect the pharma companies directly to the patient to help eliminate fake medicines from the system,” says Furquan Kidwai, founder and CEO of online pharmacy Dawaai.
There are 500-plus pharmaceutical companies in the country that are manufacturing drugs distributed by 1000-plus distributors through 45,000-plus licensed pharmacies, he explains using numbers to explain how fragmented the market is. This has resulted in the creation of many layers between the pharma company and the end consumer that has allowed one of the biggest counterfeit medicine markets in the world to flourish.
Because of the cryogenic nature of the market, there are about 20,000 unique SKUs (stock-taking units) available for about 500-600 medicines — each medicine is sold under 10-15 different names. “Take Paracetamol as an example. It is sold under 30 different names — Panadol, Paramol, Parasol etc,” he says.
An average shop has say about 200 SKUs so patients have to go through the hassle of visiting multiple pharmacies to get their prescription fulfilled. The pandemic pushed Dawaai’s user adoption rate to 5x-6x, leading to a current growth rate of 9x. 
The health tech numbers are impressive. One source says there are 331 health tech startups in Pakistan, another says telehealth companies grew by 900pc during the pandemic. But this picture is skewed. While various health tech addresses a spectrum of challenges, from menstrual health to setting up appointments with doctors, the ease of access is limited to the relatively affluent that have access to the internet and a basic understanding of technology. Till the net is cast wider and deeper, health tech will not be a panacea for all healthcare problems in Pakistan.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Looking towards the small guy,"There are more than 3,000 Pakistani sellers on Alibaba.com with close to 90pc of them coming from Sialkot","

Mr Song Song, Country Manager, Ali Baba

 
For as long as one can remember, Pakistan has been stuck in a perpetual cycle of boom and busts. Ask any minister, finance bro or stock analyst masquerading as an economist the recipe to break free from this and they will tell you increasing exports is the answer. That’s also something Commerce Advisor Abdul Razak Dawood has made a key priority since the first day. 
One such measure his ministry could claim credit for was getting Pakistan placed on the Amazon’s sellers’ list, which we were told would open new avenues for exports for local entrepreneurs. How many of those businesses, mostly used to business-to-business (B2B )contracts, would actually be able to position themselves in the direct-to-consumer (D2C) segment on arguably the most competitive marketplace on the planet was a different matter altogether. 

There are more than 3,000 Pakistani sellers on Alibaba.com with close to 90pc of them coming from Sialkot

Meanwhile, a few thousand businesses from the country had focused their energies eastward towards Alibaba.com. In fact, Pakistan now ranks the highest in terms of paid sellers on the world’s largest B2B e-commerce platform’s Global Business. Since 2017-18, the number of Pakistani sellers on the platform has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent, according to a presentation the company presented to a roundtable at the Board of Investment’s recent conference. 
“There are more than 3,000 Pakistani sellers on Alibaba.com with close to 90pc of them coming from Sialkot,” says Mr Song Song, the company’s country manager for Pakistan. And now he wants to expand the platform’s reach to traders and businesses in other cities, especially the export-oriented ones like Faisalabad and Gujranwala, in addition to Karachi and Lahore. For that purpose, he and his team have been increasing their outreach efforts through awareness sessions at the various chambers of commerce and industries. 
“Apparel is the most popular category among Pakistani sellers, followed by sports goods and surgical equipment given that the majority of our users are from Sialkot,” he shares. According to the ‘Digital B2B Outlook 2022 Pakistan’ published by Alibaba at the beginning of the year, 63pc of the sellers are in the apparel category while a total of 3.2 million listings have been made from the country so far. But how much does that translate into dollar terms? “Unfortunately even we don’t know the gross merchandise value of goods sold from the country on our platform,” Mr Song Song says. 
That’s strange, isn’t it? Maybe at first. As a B2B e-commerce platform facilitating cross-border trade across hundreds of geographies, Alibaba.com is used by many buyers and sellers for discovery and information before actually negotiating the deal between themselves. “Outside China, the US and Malaysia, the transactions still take place offline so it becomes difficult for us to estimate the worth of goods sold,” the executive explains. 
The reason behind that is, of course, the complicated nature of B2B payments which is made even more complex due to the cross-border nature of transactions. “It’s not like B2C where the average order value would be a few dollars. You are talking hundreds of thousands or even a million dollars per order which the current infrastructure doesn’t allow for in Pakistan. And payments are just one component of it; there’s also fulfilment, integration with customs authorities etc. That entire ecosystem needs to be built,” Mr Song Song says.  
In that case, who else to build the ecosystem other than Alibaba.com — the most successful B2B e-commerce platform? “It requires huge amounts of investments as well as time. In China, it took us around five years to develop it,” he says. Before the company embarks on such an ambitious plan, it first wants to create a local presence and create more awareness among the sellers. 
“We are going to set up a local entity for Alibaba.com, the first such for any of the companies of the Alibaba Group [excluding Daraz and Easypaisa as they were acquisitions], and build an on-ground team in Pakistan for functions like customer service, outreach and marketing by the end of the calendar year,” Mr SongSong shares. This is along with growing their channel partners — currently numbering 10 — who currently act as the e-commerce platform’s representatives in the country and help onboard new users and provide support to the existing ones.

2021-07-27,2022-03-21,Hasty growth in housing finance,The euphoric demand for housing finance and a liberal supply of loans remains subject to ground reality checks.,"Agriculture and housing loans — along with micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) finance — are vital for boosting economic activity. And, if banks start lending more to all the three sectors at the same time, that almost guarantees accelerated GDP growth in the short-to-medium term. 
Currently, though, banks are not wholesomely engaged in such an exercise. But the government and the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) are trying to promote just that. Policies introduced for accelerating housing loans offer an added advantage to the government — they make room for politically-motivated tax amnesty in the name of the documentation of the economy. The ongoing Naya Pakistan Housing Programme (NPHP) is no exception.
Regardless of the fact that this is opening yet another avenue under this programme for the whitening of tax-evaded money, housing loans being offered under NPHP are quite promising. Already, they have reactivated the real estate and building construction sector and continue to enliven demand for outputs of dozens of allied industries and services sub-sectors. Their impact on the overall economy (rebased to 2015-16) is already being felt and is sure to become more and more pronounced with the passage of time. That is if future governments let the programme continue in its current form and spirit.

The euphoric demand for housing finance and liberal supply of loans remains subject to ground reality checks after the expiry of the tax amnesty scheme 

Within seven months of this fiscal year (ie between July 2021 and Jan 2022), banks disbursed fresh consumers loans of Rs47.6 billion for the construction of buildings. In addition to this, they also disbursed Rs11.8bn loans to their employees for the same purpose.
Thus, overall lending for construction of buildings in the first seven months of this fiscal year totalled Rs59.4bn, the latest SBP stats reveal. During the same period of the last fiscal year, total lending for housing buildings was too small — Rs7.9bn for general consumers and Rs22bn for bank employees or a total of Rs29.9bn! 
The demand for housing finance remained strong right from the beginning of this fiscal year partly because builders were using tax-evaded money for launching new housing projects following extension in the tax amnesty scheme. Partly, higher economic growth in 2021-21 compared to that of 2019-20 also motivated people to take advantage of the Naya Pakistan Housing Programme made easier this year — and apply for housing loans. 
So, the volumes of housing finance offered so far could have been larger had banks been able to process loans applications a bit more speedily. The PTI government, challenged on all fronts and struggling for its survival, is pushing banks to their limits through the central bank to accelerate the disbursement of housing loans. So, one can hope that the volumes of fresh housing loans would grow even faster in near future, more so because the “no-question asked” status of the investment coming into this sector has been extended — once again — to the end of FY22 in June.

The overall lending for construction of buildings in the first seven months of this fiscal year totalled Rs59.4bn while during the same period last fiscal year, total lending for housing buildings was Rs7.9bn for general consumers and Rs22bn for bank employees or a total of Rs29.9bn

Growth in housing finance and underlying expansion in construction activities continue to fuel growth in allied sectors as well. During July-Dec 2021, manufacturing of iron and steel grew by 18.4 per cent, whereas in the same period of 2020 this sub-sector of large-scale manufacturing had contracted by 12.1pc, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics. 
Monthly cement production which was below 3.7 million tonnes in July 2021 gradually picked up and peaked at 4.48m tonnes in October before coming down to 4.3m tonnes and 4m tonnes in November and December respectively, due to a dramatic rise in the cost of production of coal-fired cement plants after skyrocketing of coal prices in international markets — and not due to slackness in demand. 
To meet the increasing demand for housing finance, and particularly to meet the demand for low-cost housing, the SBP has now eased prudential regulations of microfinance banks. “The changes made in the prudential regulations include additional guidance on property assessment, mortgage creation and risk management,” the central bank announced on March 16. By end of 2021, total lending already made in the housing sector stood at Rs20bn — the number of beneficiaries was 75,000, an SBP press release said.
Moving forward, accelerated disbursement of housing finance through microfinance banks can be expected to boost volumes of financing and enhance the number of loan takers. But whether microfinance loans for housing can actually lead to the construction of new low-cost housing units is doubtful. These loans are likely to end up for purchasing already constructed flats and one-unit residential units or for the renovation of existing houses and apartments. 
The current euphoric demand for housing finance from commercial banks and an equally liberal supply of housing loans remain subject to ground reality checks after the expiry of the tax amnesty scheme in June. If tax amnesty for investment in the housing sector is allowed to expire on time — and not extended any further — construction of new houses and apartments may come to a halt. But that perhaps doesn’t bother the government. 
Another worrisome aspect of the housing finance euphoria is that banks are offering housing loans to their employees, particularly senior executives, a bit too liberally. The central bank needs to watch mortgage finance to bank employees closely to ward off any possible development of banks-builders nexus. Powerful builders particularly those with strong links with politicians and the establishment have successfully circumvented banking and environmental laws in the past for the construction of prized projects both in Karachi and Islamabad. Some of them still continue to do this. 
While making more housing loans, banks must also focus on ensuring their sustainability in terms of market risks and the risk of defaults.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,The challenges of the electronic warehouse receipt system,"If run professionally and efficiently, it may reduce pressure on farmers to sell their produce in panic immediately ...","The resource-constraint smallholder farmers are unattractive candidates for credit from formal financial institutions, which tend to ignore them because of their often unpredictable, fragmented and unstructured agricultural activities.
The State Bank of Pakistan, like the central banks of many other developing countries, is introducing schemes to increase access of small farmers to the formal credit channels, saving them from exploitation by informal money lenders.
The SBP, in this respect, has recently launched the electronic warehouse receipt (EWR) system for maize crop in Kasur district, almost a year after the scheme was introduced for paddy crop in Hafizabad, another central Punjab district. The EWR enables the depositor, whether a producer or dealer, of an agriculture commodity to use it as collateral for obtaining bank loans or trade in commodity markets, if and when the system is linked with the commodities exchange as well.
If run professionally and efficiently, it may also reduce pressure on farmers to sell their produce in panic immediately after harvests when prices are normally low. Thus, it may ensure a better return to farmers for their financial and physical investment and also help stabilise market prices. The system may also reduce post-harvest losses as care of the stored commodity is handed over to certified warehouses equipped with the required facilities and expertise.

If run professionally and efficiently, it may reduce pressure on farmers to sell their produce in panic immediately after harvests when prices are normally low while allowing agriculture commodities to be used as collateral for bank loans

However, the insufficient number of certified warehouses complying with preservation norms, lack of awareness among farmers and their limited business skills, and no incentives for buyers to purchase commodities from the warehouses are identified as the stumbling blocks in the expansion of the system.
Afaq Tiwana, a progressive farmer, says the EWR may be beneficial for the community only if the SBP scheme includes a blueprint for bridging the infrastructure (warehouses and logistics) gap. “There is an acute shortage of certified warehouses and reliable logistic facilities that are required to run the system satisfactorily.” He advocates for incentivising the infrastructure building by assuring business for the owners of the storage units the whole year so that they are attracted to invest more and more in the sector.
For this purpose, he argues, the government needs to get out of the business of wheat, the biggest crop of the country. The government is the major player in the wheat market but does not utilise private warehouses depriving them of around six-month business, he says. A mix of wheat, rice and maize crops, etc will ensure the warehouses do business throughout the year because of their different seasons. Mr Tiwana says for food security the government may buy grain from the warehouses if and when required through bidding.
Ibad Khan, president of Guava Growers Association, endorses the views saying by opting for the private warehousing system the government may save non-development expenditures worth billions of rupees consumed by thousands of Food Department employees in the name of salaries and perks, operating costs of their vehicles and buildings, etc “without doing any good”.
“The (provincial) government may buy four million tonnes of wheat from the certified warehouses through the Pakistan Commodities Exchange and lift the grain when needed from there. It will equal a surplus of thousands of food department employees and thus save huge funds required for the functioning of the department, as well as the hassle of checking theft of the crop from its storages by unscrupulous staff.”
Mr Khan thinks the farm produce warehousing concept may gain currency provided the farming community is given proper awareness and the purpose is well served easily by engaging the Agriculture Department’s field staff. “If a farmer learns that by spending Rs50, for instance, as storage rent, his produce will earn Rs100 then he will automatically turn towards the EWR scheme. The extension wing of the Agriculture Department is in close proximity to the rural population and may help mobilise them for it.”
An attractive package to build high-quality warehouses can find 15 to 20 investors in each village ready to build the storage if provided information/guidance about the business scope and initial technical assistance in running the facilities until these become self-sufficient, he asserts.
While the functioning of the facility will benefit the farming community in many ways, Mr Tiwana says the prevailing farm produce trade system is built to make the rich richer. “At present 70 to 80 per cent of commodities are sold at harvesting time in the country. And thus, these fetch lower rates for the farmers. Large processors and the influential (textile, feed, flour millers, etc) have huge amounts of cash at hand and make these purchases knowing that the prices will shoot up within months. Besides value-addition through their mills, they also earn a big profit through commodities trade, robbing millions of farmers of the money that actually belongs to them.”
The EWR facility will save the poor farmers from panic selling as well as stabilise prices in the open market at harvesting time because an adequate quantity of the produce would have been deposited with the warehouses, freeing the market from surplus crops. This would ensure a better return even for those farmers who will be opting to sell their produce in the spot market, he adds.
Mr Khan stresses that the warehousing concept must be linked to the Commodities Exchange for the sake of the sustainability of the system and that the Exchange should be relocated to Punjab, the largest producer of agricultural products so that those involved in active farming have easy access to it. He laments that no farmer association was engaged by the SBP or any other government entity to seek their input for the scheme.
For Amer Hayat Bhandara, a progressive grower from Pakpattan, the EWR facility seems to be working only for those farmers and final buyers who are qualified customers of commercial banks. He points out that one of the most common problems of the farmer is informal debt: farmers take loans from people in the market with personal guarantees and with a condition that the crop will be sold through them.
Will the middlemen allow the farmer to go for the EWR, he questions? Suppose if farmers want to do so, then the debt of the middleman will be repaid through EWR, but how will the inputs like seeds, fertilisers, fuel and pesticides for the next crop be acquired?

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Business leaders and sleepless nights,It’s time to lie low as there is no chance of any clarity till the no-confidence move is over.,"


 
THE critical domains of the economy and foreign affairs have taken a back seat as the political leadership has been left to scramble for continuing in power. This seems to be rather dicey in a world that is trying to deal with fragile energy markets and food security in its Covid-battered existence, and global peace in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
In addition to tales of human sufferings, the war has disturbed global commodity markets, disrupted supply chains, hiked freight charges and posed challenges to the global financial system after the West slapped harsh sanctions on Russia and excluded it from the SWIFT system of money transfers. Experts and economists have predicted slower growth and an increase in inflation worldwide.   
Instead of strategising to deal with the evolving global challenges, Islamabad appears to be too busy to care. Global experts have included Pakistan amongst the more vulnerable nations where the impact of the fallout of war is expected to be severe owing to the resource-deficient country’s dependence on oil, gas and edible imports.

It’s time to lie low as there is no chance of any clarity till the no-confidence move is over

Just as the masses are doing, businesses are also watching closely the events unfolding at a bewildering pace under the full glare of the media spotlight. With the final outcome not quite certain, the whole saga is keeping business houses unnerved.
The common man is desperately waiting for the debilitating economic stress to ease off to the extent that it possibly can, while the business class is dreading a hostile reaction of the West to the hard stance of the government towards the US and Europe. The handshake images of Prime Minister Imran Khan and President Putin in Moscow on the day Russia launched its attack on Ukraine has already placed the country in an awkward position. 
Some like to project the current situation in Pakistan as the expected manifestation of civil unrest over inflation and job losses, while others link it to be the outcome of deeper structural imbalance. And then there are those who see the struggle rooted in efforts to uphold the supremacy of civilian leadership. 
Argumentative Pakistanis can debate the politics, but they all agree that the economy and its challenges have taken a back seat for now and things will be difficult irrespective of the final outcome of the no-confidence motion in parliament.
The leading lights of business class, when approached for a comment, were evasive. Afraid to land on the wrong side of the current or the future set of rulers, they shared their disappointment with the political class privately, saying it was frustrating to watch the politicians “stoop too low whenever tested”. 
A senior business leader commented” “Prime Minister Imran Khan and his confidants are inciting violence much like Trump did in the US. How can they not understand the consequences? If politicians fail to resist the temptation to take their conflict out of parliament it can make the country drift towards anarchy. Yes, we are worried for our businesses, but we are more concerned about the safety and security of our family and the future of this country.” 
Musadaq Zulqarnain, of Interloop fame, believed that “irrespective of the outcome of the vote in parliament or the movement on the streets, the economy is not in a good shape. It will get worse because of political turbulence which will be followed by popular measures to please the masses without fundamental corrections. 
“Pakistan needs a sustained growth of 7-8 per cent for several years, powered by an increase in exports if it wants to come out of its economic troubles. The only solution is a consensus document — the Charter of Economy — which must be vigorously followed irrespective of the party in power,” he said.
Nasser Hayat Magoon, former president of the Federation of Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), said the troubles had aggravated in the last couple of years. The budget, he thought, has failed to spark much interest among the legislators. In his opinion, it is influenced by “a select group of businessmen that encircles the leadership”. 
Sources in the Ministry of Finance told Dawn that the budget exercise initiated in January has been in progress at the routine pace. 
Pulling out his wish-list, Mr Magnoon said: “The FPCCI suggested simplification of taxation, which was promised but was resisted by the tax bureaucracy. We do not expect a business-friendly budget. The timing of the budget will be contingent on how the present chaotic political situation settles.” 
He said the private sector needs to communicate with political parties and sensitise them to the variety of problems that are being faced by businesses. He warned that street agitation in the current charged environment may have serious consequences. 
Mian Anjum Nisar, another business leader, lamented the lack of clarity in politics, while Majyd Aziz was critical of mismatched priorities of successive governments. 
Regardless of the concerns voiced by the business community, everybody realises that at least in the short term, there is no chance of any clarity till the no-confidence move is over.

2022-07-27,2022-03-21,Auto parts — setting a new record for imports,New entrants are rolling out vehicles with mere 5pc locally made parts which is insufficient to reduce foreign exchange burden.,"Pakistan’s import bill for completely and semi-knocked down (CKD/SKD) kits for cars imported by local assemblers has crossed one billion dollars in just eight months of 2021-22 which is significantly higher than the record high bill of $1.12 billion for the entire of FY21.
The 8MFY22 ended with $1.102bn as compared to $557 million in the same period last fiscal. 
The low levels of localisation by Chinese and Korean investors under Auto Policy 2016-2021 for five years as well as in the new models by existing assemblers have played a key role in boosting the import bill.
As per data of the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the new and old entrants brought CKD/SKD kits worth $4.987bn from 2016-2017 to July-February 2021-2022, thus nullifying claims of achieving higher localisation.
Sources said that the new entrants have started rolling out vehicles from their assembly lines with a mere five per cent locally made parts which is insufficient to reduce the burden on the foreign exchange. 

New entrants are rolling out vehicles with mere five per cent locally made parts which is insufficient to reduce the burden on the foreign exchange rate

Assemblers are now in top gear as the eight months of FY22 ended with a whooping sales jump of 57.5pc in cars to 149,813 units. They are also excited over huge bookings in hands whose delivery time ranges between three months to 11 months. Jeeps and pickups sales have also surged by 51.5pc in 8MFY22 to 28,437 units.
Huge demand for cars has led to a massive jump in CKD/SKD imports to $1.120bn in FY21 from $478mn in FY20, up by 134pc thanks to low-interest rates and attractive auto financing by the banks till the third quarter of 2021
However, curbs on auto financing from the last quarter of 2021, persistent increase in car prices and long delays in delivery appear to have not hurt the buyers’ sentiments in the last eight months, while buyers are also satisfied over the rising resale value of the vehicles owing to months’ long delivery timings, soaring prices and on-money for vehicles for immediate delivery. 
The import bill of CKD/SKD was $660m in FY17 which later swelled to $809m in FY18 and then remained at $818mn in FY19. The fiscal year 2019-2020 was a bad year for the entire country due to the flare-up in Covid-19 from March to June followed by the government’s decision to close down the industrial units in April 2020. As a result, the FY20 import bill of CKD/SKD was just $478m.
Stakeholders had been trumpeting 70pc localisation in Suzuki Mehran which ruled the roads for over 30 years without significant model change. After the end of the iconic Mehran journey in 2018, the claim of achieving higher localisation by stakeholders has now been confined to 55-60pc in various existing Japanese models and 35-45pc in new models. 
It seems that no serious efforts have been made by the existing Japanese assemblers in the old and new models to improve the utilisation levels  of locally made parts in vehicles.
A vendor, who asked not to be named, said the import bill of CKD/SKD would remain under pressure as the new entrants, who had approved their projects under the Auto Policy 2016-2021, would enjoy a honeymoon period for the next four to five years to keep rolling out vehicles with negligible local content. Besides, new models by the existing Japanese assemblers will also take time in improving local content in the vehicles.
He said vendors had asked the government not to allow vehicles’ assembly of higher engine power under tAuto Policy 2016-2021. The new entrants, instead of introducing small cars below 800cc, shifted their focus towards the assembly of high engine power sports utility vehicles (SUV) whose numbers are growing every day.
Chief Operating Officer, Balochistan Wheel Limited (BWL), Muhammad Irfan Ghani in a letter to the CEO Engineering Development Board (EDB) said the EDB is the custodian of the auto vending industry which encourages the localisation of auto parts.
The auto sector in Pakistan is now more than 50 years old but the assemblers have not done localisation seriously, he complained.
He said the pace of localisation of auto parts is too slow due to the discouraging attitudes and lengthy procedures adopted by the assemblers which form a monopoly for their foreign principals. They protect their own interests to use their CKD parts and have made localisation very  difficult. 
Mr Ghani said the country’s precious foreign exchange is being wasted due to non-localisation while many assemblers are not taking parts from the local vendors in some of their newly launched models.
The matter came up for discussion during the first meeting of the Auto Industry Development and Export Committee (AIDEC) held on March 8, 2022, which was attended by the auto stakeholders and officials of the relevant ministries. The AIDEC meeting had decided that the EDB would schedule a joint meeting between Baluchistan Wheels and Pak Suzuki to resolve the matter.
However, AIDEC committee members reiterated that the localisation of parts and components must be pursued in letter and spirit. 
Former Chairman Pakistan Association of Parts and Accessories Manufacturers (Paapam), Abdul Rahman Aizaz attributed the rising import bill of CKD to the massive revival in sales of cars and SUVs from the depressed sales scenario of 2019-2020.
Under Auto Policy 2016-2021, most of the new entrants have focused on manufacturing SUVs, which too has resulted in the higher value of CKD imports. He said that sales volumes of new entrants and old players have shown phenomenal growth due to improving economic indicators.
Since the new entrants under Auto Policy 2016-21 can avail the concession on import of CKD for five years, localisation of parts in such vehicles, especially of SUVs, is in the catching-up phase, he added.
Mr Aizaz said that the unprecedented surge in international prices of various resins and metals, rupee devaluation against the dollar and multiple times higher freight charges have further enhanced the landed cost of almost all raw materials.

2022-02-27,2022-03-21,Surviving tough times,"Regardless of who wins and who loses the no-trust motion, the government will not find it easy to handle the economy.","The rupee hit its lowest ever of over 180 to a dollar in the interbank market on the weekend as the shares market continues to decline. 
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) appears largely satisfied with the PTI government’s explanation of the Rs346 billion relief package announced late last month in an apparent attempt to appease the inflation-stricken households. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) kept the key policy rate unchanged at 9.75 per cent but its warning that it could advance the next Monetary Policy Committee meeting to raise the interest rates if need be has pushed cut-off yields in the last public sector debt auction.
The political instability in the wake of a no-confidence motion submitted by the opposition to oust the prime minister is forcing the government to take populist measures that it might not have if it weren’t facing the existential threat from the opposition political parties that have come together to push Imran Khan out of power in spite of their deep divisions. 

Regardless of who wins and who loses the no-trust motion, the government will not find it easy to handle the economy — many hard decisions will have to be made

No one expected the Kaptaan to go away without fighting till the last ball, but the last week’s events in Islamabad have spawned fears of violence. The storming of the Parliament Lodges, where the opposition lawmakers were housed by police commandos and counter-terrorism force was followed by the attack of the PTI workers on Sindh House in Islamabad. It happened after the opposition gave media access to the place to interview dissident parliamentarians of the ruling party. 
The ruling party’s insistence to gather a million people outside the parliament in the event of the vote on the no-confidence resolution and the threats being tossed around by the ministers has forced the opposition political parties to make their own plans to counter the move. Indeed, everyone expected the prime minister to fight back — but not in this way. 
The situation is fluid and may likely continue for several weeks to come, with its impact expected to reverberate for many months. Regardless of who wins and who loses the no-trust motion, the government will not find it easy to handle the economy. Many tough decisions will have to be made. If the opposition succeeds in de-seating the prime minister, it will have its work cut out for them. 
The first job would be to approach the IMF to release the next tranche to shore up foreign exchange reserves and take the pressure off the home currency. PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has already hinted at renegotiating the deal with the multilateral lender. It is not clear if the Washington-based fund would be more kind to the new government than the Imran Khan administration. 
The second job, the businessmen interviewed by telephone over the weekend say, for whoever — the PTI or the opposition parties — is in power after the vote on the motion would be to mend Pakistan’s relationship with the West, especially the United States. “That does not necessarily mean that we have to dial down our ties with China. Going to Russia when the Kremlin had planned to attack Ukraine was a big foreign policy mistake Imran Khan made. He could have called off the tour and stayed neutral. That would not have brought upon us such pressure from the European Union and the US, with which our relations are already facing problems due to the Taleban takeover of Kabul last summer,” a textile exporter argued. 
“Improvement in our ties with Washington and European capitals is crucial not only for securing some concessions from the IMF but also to get out of the grey list of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).”
A senior executive of a chemical company was of the view that once politics cool down Islamabad will have to reconsider its policy towards India. “If you think you can improve your relationship with the West and get off the FATF’s enhanced monitoring regime without making some kind of headway with New Delhi, you are totally mistaken. I have information that our present military leadership too is in favour of resuming ties with India,” he claimed.
However, there are others who feel that the top priority has to be given to the resolution of domestic political problems. “The settlement of the outstanding issues with the IMF and the western powers is important. But more important is to tackle our domestic problems first. I cannot say if the present government will be in power after a few days or not. But in my opinion, once this crisis is over, all the parties must sit together and develop a consensus on electoral reforms so that we can have political stability. I think that the government term of five years should be curtailed to four years. We are very impatient people and a kind of fatigue starts to take over us every three to four years. If we manage to clean up our political mess, we will be able to put back the economy on the rails and end our international isolation.”

2022-03-20,2022-03-21,"IMF seeks details of petrol, power subsidy funding",Finance minister makes it clear there are no more outstanding issues as the IMF only wants to ascertain sources of funding.,"


 
ISLAMABAD: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has sought copies of financial agreements with the provincial governments and other details from the federal government to confirm the financing of discounts on electricity and petroleum products announced by Prime Minister Imran Khan, Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin disclosed at a press conference on Sunday.
The talks with the IMF were earlier scheduled to conclude on Friday last but then “they [Fund staff] wanted to see agreements with the provinces to basically reassure we are not involved in aerial firing” on financing of PM’s relief package for petroleum prices, the minister said.
Mr Tarin made it clear that there were no more outstanding issues, as they only wanted to ascertain the sources of funding to cover the cost of reduction in electricity and petroleum products. They were assured the package would be covered through provincial shares and dividends of the state-owned entities, he said. “They said show us agreements with the provinces,” he remarked.
The federal government has signed rolling memorandums of understanding with the provinces to provide cash surplus every year to show lower consolidated fiscal deficit but are sometimes remain unhonoured when provinces also go into overdrafts.
“So there is no problem. We already have agreements that we will show them” when the two sides would meet again on Monday, the minister said, adding he would hold a final policy round up with the fund mission on Tuesday. 
The two sides will then finalise the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) amicably and take it to the executive board on a convenient date.
After initial compliance with the commitments made with the IMF in December 2021 to increase petroleum levy and power tariff, PM Khan reversed the progress by announcing Rs10 per litre reduction in petroleum products bringing down levy to zero besides a cut in electricity rates by Rs5 per unit instead of a schedule of increases agreed to with the IMF to address circular debt.
Up to 700,000-tonne wheat import
Responding to a question, Mr Tarin said all the provinces were part of the minimum wheat support price at Rs2,200 per 40 kg approved by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet last week — about 13 per cent higher than Rs1,950 of last year and showed confidence to exceed procurement target that was also set at 6.9 million tonnes last week.
He said the wheat production was then estimated to be 5pc to 6pc higher and may not require imports except 500,000 to 700,000 tonnes for strategic reserves. “I would like to increase strategic reserves from 1.8 million tonnes to two million tonnes, depending on international prices,” he said, adding he would not burn foreign exchange if international wheat prices remain higher.
In response to a question about former PML-N finance minister Miftah Ismail’s statement that the country could not launch international bonds as Pakistan’s bond yields had gone high due to economic policies and fundamentals, Mr Tarin said his statement would not change ground reality. This was not Pakistan specific but with entire developing countries including Turkey, Indonesia and others, he remarked.
Mr Tarin said financing was not an issue but the interest rates being offered were higher. He said he still had $4-5bn worth of offers from banks, but “why should I take expensive loans?” Mr Miftah should also recall they had left the government with just one-month import financing that now stood at $16.6bn – against average monthly imports of about $7bn in eight months, he added.
Responding to a question whether he would continue as finance minister in the next government if asked, Mr Tarin said he was a man of principles and would at no cost do that as he was a PTI senator. “I will remain finance minister if the PTI government stays, otherwise will go home. I am not a renegade,” he said.
He expressed the hope that 5pc economic growth rate was expected despite various headwinds this year, as some sectors were also showing robust growth including large-scale manufacturing, agriculture and exports. “This shows there is thrust in the economy and momentum is returning,” he said, adding that this did not mean there were no headwinds but policy adjustments would continue to absorb them.
“The welcome news is that the LSM has grown by 8.2pc in January against same month of last year and 4.2pc against December 2021,” he said, adding the LSM growth had slowed down in August and September 2021 but the trend had reversed. “Our economic growth momentum has picked up again as all agriculture crops are growing at 6 to 12 percent, and exports and services sectors are also growing at a high pace,” the minister pointed out.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,NA speaker summons no-trust session on 25th,"Government to file reference in SC today to end politics of ""sale and purchase"".","ISLAMABAD: In an apparent move to prolong the voting on a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan, National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser on Sunday summoned the session of the lower house of parliament on March 25, violating the Constitution under which he is bound to convene a session within 14 days after the submission of a requisition. 
Meanwhile, the government also took a significant decision under which it will file a reference in the Supreme Court on Monday (today), seeking “an opinion” of the apex court on two main points — whether the disqualification of a legislator is for life time and whether the dissident MNAs of any party can cast vote on a no-confidence resolution. 
The speaker, who under the Constitution was bound to call the NA session by March 21 [within 14 days after the opposition’s requisition], gave an excuse that since the three-day conference of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) would be held in the NA hall, there was no other place in the federal capital to convene the NA session. 
This is despite the fact that the capital offers alternative locations where such an event can be held such as the spacious Jinnah Convention Centre, Prime Minister Secretariat, Pak-China Centre, two five-star hotels, etc. 

Government to file reference in SC today to end politics of ‘sale and purchase’

The opposition lashed out at the speaker for his decision to hold the NA session on March 25, saying he had violated the Constitution to prolong the voting on no-trust motion. 
Sources in the government told Dawn that the decisions to hold the NA session on March 25 and filing of the reference in the Supreme Court were taken at a meeting presided over by Prime Minister Khan at his Banigala residence on Sunday. 
Speaker Asad Qaiser issued an order saying the [opposition’s] requisition was received on March 8 for summoning the National Assembly. Whereas, on Jan 21, 2022, a motion had been adopted by the NA to allow the exclusive use of NA chamber for the 48th session of the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers scheduled for March 22, 23 or any other date. 
He said the renovation work on the NA chamber and its lobbies had commenced on the requirement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the end of February 2022, which was under taken by the Capital Development Authority. 
The speaker said that after the receipt of [the opposition’s] requisition, the NA Secretariat requested the Senate Secretariat to provide chamber of the Senate for holding the NA session, but the latter pointed out that the Senate chamber was also not available for being under renovation. 
“Thereafter, the CDA chairman and deputy commissioner, Islamabad, were also approached to arrange and provide a suitable building for holding the session of the National Assembly outside the parliament building, at Islamabad. However, they have informed in writing that no suitable place is available at present in Islamabad for holding the NA session,” Mr Qaisar added. 
“In view of the aforementioned facts and circumstances, it is evident that no suitable place would be available for holding the session of the NA till March 24. Having no adequate option available whatsoever, for holding of the NA session before March 24, therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under clause (3) of Article 54 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, read with Article 254 of the Constitution, I hereby summon the session of the National Assembly on the first available date i.e. Friday, March 25 at 11.00am at the Parliament House, Islamabad,” the order said. 
Meanwhile, Planning and Development Minister Asad Umar said in a tweet that the government would file a reference in the Supreme Court that would end the politics of “sell and purchase” and diminish the influence of “easy money” and “influence in politics”. 



 
When contacted, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said the decision to file the reference was taken by the prime minister in a meeting on Sunday. “The basic reasons of filing the reference are — to know whether the disqualification of any legislators is for lifetime and that can PTI dissidents cast vote on the no-trust motion,” he added. 
A source said the NA speaker could call the session on March 21 to meet the constitutional requirement [within 14 days after the requisition] and adjourn the session for three days for the OIC conference and it could resume on March 24. 
According to Article 63 of the Constitution, the prime minister is given three days after the tabling of a no-trust motion, for preparation. However, the government is apparently trying to linger on the voting on the motion — first by an excuse of “lack of suitable place for the session till March 25” and then filing of the reference in the Supreme Court. 
The information minister said the government was only seeking an opinion of the apex court and it could be given by the court even on the first day of filing of the reference or the court could take more time it deemed appropriate.

2022-03-20,2022-03-21,Opposition calls for Asad Qaiser’s trial under Article 6,"PTI accused of running social media campaign against army; PML-Q wants PM to take notice of ""anti-Pakistan"" drive.","ISLAMABAD / LAHORE: Opposition parties on Sunday slammed National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser for not convening the assembly session within 14 days of its requisition to take up their no-confidence resolution against Prime Minister Imran Khan, demanding that he should be tried under Article 6 of the Constitution.
The opposition parties also lashed out at the PM for, what they called, using the religion card in an effort to save his government and accused his party of launching a ‘propaganda campaign’ through its social media team against the army over its ‘neutrality’.
Speaking at a news conference, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari expressed the hope that the Supreme Court would take notice of the violation of the Constitution by the speaker, proving that there was at least one institution in the country for the protection of the Constitution, democracy and right of the vote of the parliamentarians. 
Stating that the job of the SC was to protect and implement the Constitution, the PPP chairman hoped that the court “will not facilitate this government on its unconstitutional step” and that it would make a constitutional decision, not a political one. 

PTI accused of running social media campaign against army; PML-Q wants PM to take notice of ‘anti-Pakistan’ drive

“We appreciate how the SC sent a message of standing with the law and Constitution, even on a weekend,” he said in an apparent reference to the hearing of a petition of the Supreme Court Bar Association during which the court had reprimanded the government over the attack by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) activists on Sindh House. 
He said the SC was already hearing a petition that had not been filed by them, but the bar association. However, he said the court had issued notices to the political parties as well in the case and they would present their viewpoint before it. 
“This coward captain [the PM] is running away from the vote of no confidence. He is escaping to the extent that he has made the speaker abrogate the Constitution,” the PPP chairman observed. 
Mr Bhutto-Zardari lashed out at PM Khan for using Islam for party politics and asked him not to use the slogan of Madinah state. 
“You (the PM) are the foreign-sponsored and foreign-funded agent who has been planted in our system,” he said while criticising the government’s foreign policy. He alleged that the prime minister had been given the task to damage the country’s foreign policy and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and that he had done it “beautifully”. 
He accused Mr Khan of adopting the foreign policy of India, stating that there was no difference in the foreign policies of the two countries. 
Addressing a separate news conference, PML-N’s senior vice-president Shahid Khaqan Abbasi also accused the speaker and the premier of violating the Constitution and committing treason under Article 6 which, he said, was not a joke. He said if anyone would interfere in the democratic process of no-trust move, he would commit ‘treason’. 
PML-N secretary general Ahsan Iqbal alleged that Mr Khan was using religion card to cover up his “dirty politics and incompetence”. 
Earlier, in a statement, PML-N information secretary Marriyum Aurangzeb stated if the speaker failed to convene the NA session before March 22, he would be guilty of violating the Constitution that was be punishable under Article 6. 
Campaign against institutions
During the news conference, the PPP chairman also alleged that the PM and his social media team had launched a ‘propaganda campaign’ to ‘provoke’ an institution so that it could not remain ‘neutral’. 
“When a time has come when the media is talking about a neutral environment, Imran and his social media team are trying to spread the propaganda that institutions are not neutral, be it through provocation or creating a constitutional crisis,” he said.
“It is the responsibility of all of us to demand and try for every institution to work within its domain drawn by the law and Constitution, and to criticise when this does not happen. However, it is also our responsibility to oppose the prime minister, his social media team and its members who are provoking and targeting an institution under a conspiracy,” he added.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari said the prime minister had equated the term ‘neutral’ with animals and had still not apologised to the nation over it. “Our efforts have always been for neutrality. The PM, his social media team and ministers are making desperate attempts to tarnish neutrality. We condemn this,” he said without elaborating.
The PPP chairman, who had not named the institution during his press conference, later asked the Inter-Service Public Relations and the judiciary to take notice of the propaganda campaign by the PM, his social media team and the MNAs aimed at getting “the status of neutrality” changed.
Though Mr Bhutto-Zardari did not give any reference to the army when he talked about the allegation regarding the propaganda campaign against neutrality, the PML-Q and the PML-N came out more openly when they castigated the PTI government for hitting out at army and Inter-Service Intelligence by a party’s woman MNA and an important member of the PTI’s media team. 
A video clip with the audio of PTI MNA Kanwal Shauzeb shared from a twitter space “Current political situation” went viral on social media in which she could be heard apparently talking about military establishment. “They have nothing to do with performance and neither they want to manage the country. They had never done it in the past, then why will they do it now. Actually, they wanted to hijack the system and working on an agenda of minus-Imran Khan,” she said in the clip, adding that the real issue was that the premier was not allowing those sitting in “different institutions and all kinds of institutions to continue their loot and plunder” and “that’s why they are now having panic attacks”.
Since Saturday afternoon, an unusual debate has started on Twitter with a host of people, apparently the PTI supporters, trying to make the army leadership controversial by levelling all kinds of accusations. They were found accusing the army chief of trying to undermine the government and the present system. 
In response, several people also came out in support of the armed forces, blaming the present government of maligning the armed forces and its chief.
Reacting over the clip, PML-Q MNA Chaudhry Salik Hussain tweeted: “The PTI’s social media team and a woman MNA levelled false allegations on the Pakistan Army and the ISI, which are unacceptable and unbearable.” 
Mr Hussain demanded that the PM must take notice of this “dirty anti-Pakistan campaign, otherwise, the PML-Q knew well how to deal with the anti-Pakistan elements”.



 
Also, the official spokesman for PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif, Malik Ahmad Khan, tweeted that the PTI social media team would not be allowed to defame the Pakistan Army. “The state’s existence gets threatened when a state army’s central authority is compromised,” he said. 



 
“When a state will not respect the status of the institution of army, can a state survive?” he asked in a linked tweet. “The strong army is a guarantor of strong Pakistan,” the spokesman said, adding that every Pakistani was ready to sacrifice his life for country’s solidarity and progress.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Jahangir Tareen group sees their demands being met,A senior party leader in Punjab says the PM has agreed to remove CM Buzdar but wants the dissident group to wait for a while.,"LAHORE: Members of the dissident Jahangir Tareen group in the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) appear confident they will have their way after securing guarantees that the chief minister of Punjab will be removed from office.
Sources in the group told Dawn that Prime Minister Imran Khan had all but “agreed” to accept the demands of the dissident group, but has sought more time to remove Chief Minister Usman Buzdar in order to “avert the impression of being blackmailed”.
Shaken by a no-confidence motion against the premier, the PTI government is on a mission to mend ways with party dissidents. A senior delegation of government members met the Jahangir Tareen group and asked them to explain their concerns and demands in detail.
“The Tareen group remains adamant over the removal of Usman Buzdar and explained their concerns with regards to victimisation, lukewarm response from Chief Minister Office to their problems and the bureaucracy’s attitude towards their group members,” a source in the Tareen group told Dawn.
A senior party leader in Punjab told Dawn the prime minister had agreed to remove CM Buzdar but wanted the dissident group to wait for a while, because an immediate acceptance of the demand would be exploited by the opposition as if “Imran Khan has bowed down to dissidents’ blackmail”.
The PTI government had also conveyed that the new chief minister would be from PTI parliamentarians, the senior party leader said, adding that the Tareen group assured the government team that it did not want to leave the party until it would be compelled to do so.
Problems being resolved
Meanwhile, key Tareen group member Lala Tahir Randhawa said a government team led by cabinet minister Murad Raas had called on the group and agreed to resolve problems that could be addressed through the administration.
Since the government team had been given two days to resolve the parliamentarians’ issue, Mr Randhawa said a response had started to come, as deputy commissioners, district police officers and other government officials were calling all group members to address their problems.
He said that actions taken to victimise him and provincial minister Ajmal Cheema were also being undone. “The government team will return with its problems’ resolution report and the group will meet on Wednesday to take a final decision,” he added.
Mr Randhawa asserted that the group’s main demand was “minus-Buzdar” because the incumbent chief minister had ruined the governance system in the country. “Another large group of MPAs have also contacted the Tareen group and expressed support for its demand of removing Buzdar from Punjab’s chief ministership,” Mr Randhawa revealed.
Answering a question about PTI dissident and former senior minister Abdul Aleem Khan’s conduct with the group after visiting it at Jahangir Tareen’s residence, Mr Randhawa said Aleem Khan did come and a five-member committee was constituted — including Mr Randhawa, Nauman Langrial, Abdul Hayee Dasti and Ajmal Cheema — to coordinate with Aleem Khan. However, Aleem Khan did not call the committee and he alone met Sindh Governor Imran Ismail, who visited him on the instructions of the prime minister.
Sources said the government had conveyed to the Tareen group that CM Buzdar would be replaced by another senior leader within the party and four names have started doing the rounds in the PTI parliamentarians’ circle, including those of provincial minister Raja Yasir Humayun, Murad Raas, Mian Aslam Iqbal and Asif Nakai.
Tareen group members told Dawn that 13 of their 17 MPAs were elected as independents and later joined the party. “Even if the Tareen group decided to vote against PM Imran Khan in the centre and CM Buzdar in Punjab, the government would not be able to de-seat them because they were not elected on PTI tickets,” Mr Randhawa told Dawn.
Tareen ‘held party together’
Meanwhile, Jahangir Tareen’s spokesman Awn Chaudhry said some eight MNAs were standing with the group and take a decision about supporting or not supporting the government in the opposition’s no-confidence motion.
“I was personally disturbed when I saw that several MNAs stood against the party,” he said and added that it all happened because PM Khan pushed away Jahangir Tareen, who was actually keeping all MNAs intact with the party.
“Mr Tareen used to help the prime minister in difficult times and resolve party parliamentarians’ problems,” he said and asked whether the PTI should not hold the premier’s political aides accountable for all this mess.
Answering a question whether Jahangir Tareen could enter into any deal with the PML-N, he said he could not comment on his leader’s behalf. “Whatever Jahangir Tareen will decide, his whole group will go along his decision,” he asserted.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,RED ZONE FILES: All set for a collision course,Some govt officials have started to acknowledge in private that prospects of surviving this challenge from opposition are slim.,"Political entanglements may once again be headed to the courts. 
Speaker Asad Qaiser has summoned the crucial session of the National Assembly on Friday, March 25, which is three days longer than the Constitution has stipulated once the required number of parliamentarians have requisitioned a session. This order further complicates a situation that is fraught with danger and uncertainty. Here’s where things stand today and what they could portend in the coming days:

The PTI government is doing legal gymnastics with constitutional procedures, but there is no way around the vote of no-confidence against Prime Minister Imran Khan. The only way that the PM can retain his job is if the opposition fails to muster a strength of 172 in the lower house during the vote. Or if for some reason, the opposition withdraws the motion. There is no other way out for the PM and his cabinet. Legal experts say the speaker may attempt to delay the process and push the vote forward, and this may ultimately end up in courts, but the vote will need to take place one way or another. What matters is the numbers game. Everything else is a side show.
The courts may in fact become the battleground before the real battle on the floor of the National Assembly. If both the government and the opposition head to the Supreme Court with their petitions, the court may need to pronounce on the following: (i) if Article 63 of the constitution allows the party head to stop errant members of his party from voting on the confidence motion (ii) if the disqualification under Article 3 for members indulging in floor crossing can be a lifetime ban (iii) if the speaker can delay summoning of the National Assembly for more than the two-week limit spelt out in the Constitution and whether he can somehow delay the moving of the motion for the vote of no confidence. 
These issues will be addressed by the Supreme Court this week and a lot will depend on how long the SC takes to pronounce a decision. According to legal experts, if the SC reaffirms the obvious interpretation of the constitutional procedure for the vote of no-confidence, then the government will have no other option but to fight the numbers game, which it appears to be losing at this stage.
The planned rallies by the government and the opposition on Sunday, March 27, have added an explosive element to the volatile situation. Inside the Red Zone, there is a genuine fear that if these rallies are allowed to take place as scheduled, then there is a danger of violence breaking out. Now, imagine the real danger: when such violence ensues between a sitting government and its opponents, what does the police do? And if the police cannot handle such a scenario, the only option is what Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid has been referring to in his speeches: handing over security responsibility to the armed forces.
There is no need for the situation to deteriorate to such a level. But it is being dragged towards such an outcome by the government itself. What is otherwise a straightforward constitutional procedure is being weaponised by the use of mobs and threats. These in turn are being used to fuel a new narrative that focuses on accusations of horse-trading as a means to undermine a democratic process. What is being deliberately ignored is that such allegations need to be proved in a court of law for any action to be taken. They are handy for political sloganeering but cannot be used to counter what is purely a constitutional and legal process.
The government allies have stitched up their agreements with the opposition but according to Red Zone insiders, they will hold back formal announcements till after the OIC foreign ministers’ meeting. Despite the ups and downs of this week and the increase in political temperatures, the PML-Q, MQM and BAP are still locked into an understanding whose final details are being stitched up. One parliamentarian from the allied parties said their decision was intact as per the understanding reached.
One key challenge for the opposition is to keep its members safe, secure and available in Islamabad. This has led to daily congregations for dinners where the leaders keep an eye on their flock while also ensuring that none are under any pressure or facing threats. Opposition insiders say this is harder than it sounds as these elected members have a strong gravitational pull from their constituencies and yet cannot be allowed to disperse from Islamabad at a crucial time when every single vote counts.
While it is clear that the vote of no confidence will take place in a matter of days, there remain some uncertainties that are becoming a source of concern: (i) if PM Khan is on a collision course – as is evident from his speeches, including the one on Sunday – is there a way the system can be saved from instability without the opposition ceding space to him? (ii) Will the establishment be forced to intervene if matters start to spin out of control (iii) what will happen if the PM decides to use the ‘nuclear option’ of firing a senior official and appointing a new one in his place?
Some senior government officials have started to acknowledge in private that their prospects of surviving this challenge from the opposition are slim. They are now also admitting that the root cause of the dire situation they find themselves in today is the unnecessary and avoidable confrontation with the establishment. 
Yet they are now locked into a predicament that can only reinforce itself if the PTI government falls. The narrative being stitched together by the party leadership will likely further accentuate the source of the conflict and could trigger greater political instability.

The Red Zone is under stress. The coming ten days will determine if it can sustain it.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Cases of femicide rising sharply in Iraqi Kurdistan,11 women were killed in the first two months of this year...,"SULAIMANIYAH: A woman burned alive by her husband, others shot dead by a father or a teenage brother — bloody violence against women has spiked in northern Iraq’s Kurdish region.
The autonomous area, keen on projecting an image of a relative haven of stability and tolerance in war-battered Iraq, has seen a sharp rise in femicide, killings motivated by gender.
“In the past two months, there has been an increase in femicide compared to the previous year,” said Hiwa Karim Jwamir of the Kurdish General Directorate for Combating Violence Against Women.
In the first two months of 2022, 11 women were killed in autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan, most of them shot, said the official based in Sulaimaniyah.
Forty-five women were killed in 2021, up from 25 the previous year, said Jwamir.

11 women were killed in the first two months of this year

On a Friday before dawn, a 15-year-old teenager was fatally wounded by six bullets fired by her father in the village of Soran. The man told police his daughter “went out with two boys late at night”, according to a domestic violence unit which also records so-called “honour killings”.
Across Iraq, gender-based violence rose 125 per cent to over 22,000 cases between 2020 and 2021, says the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund, which has also pointed to “a worrisome increase in depression and suicide among women and girls”. Last December, a 16-year-old girl was disfigured with acid in Baghdad by an adult who wanted to marry her but had been rejected.
For years, activists have denounced violence against women and forced marriages in Iraq, which remains a conservative and patriarchal society.
“Cases of violence against women are on the rise,” said long-time Kurdistan activist Bahar Munzir, director of local group the People’s Development Organisation.
“Most of the women who are killed are victims of a family member.”
A few days before International Women’s Day on March 8, the body of a 20-year-old woman was found on the side of the road in Arbil, the capital of Kurdistan.
Maria Sami, the victim, was known on social networks for her feminist speeches.
The following day, on March 9, Kirkuk police announced the arrest of the killer, her 18-year-old brother.
While he was still on the run, he spoke by phone to a Kurdish television channel and tried to justify the killing by charging his sister had failed to obey the family. In February, mother-of-two Shinyar Huner Rafiq died in hospital, five days after being admitted with serious burns.
“Her husband had come home one evening in a state of intoxication,” Shinyar’s father, Huner Rafiq, told AFP.
“He doused her body in gasoline and set it on fire.” After the father reported the killing, police arrested the husband. “Before dying, Shinyar told us the facts,” said the bereaved father. “We recorded it, and we submitted the video to the investigators.”
Kurdistan’s prime minister Masrour Barzani denounced the “horrific case”, saying he was “deeply troubled” by the spate of violent attacks against women.
The government must impose “the heaviest possible penalty on perpetrators”, he said in a statement.
“There is no honour in honour killings. I’m determined to protect every woman, girl and child from abuse ... This scourge must end.”
In early February, Dohuk police said they had found the corpse of Doski Azad, a 23-year-old transgender woman who had been ostracised by family members.
An arrest warrant was issued to find the suspected murderer: the victim’s brother, who had in recent years been living in Europe.
He had called his family to inform them of his crime and of where the body was, according to police.
The murder was condemned by the UN mission in Iraq, and the consulates of Western countries in Arbil.
The news provoked a torrent of hatred online — against the victim, even though some voices defended minorities’ rights.
In June 2011, Kurdistan passed a law criminalising domestic violence and female genital mutilation.
The law, which threatens life in prison for “honour” crimes, was hailed by non-governmental groups as a major step forward. But the law’s enforcement is hampered by a climate of impunity and a common fear of speaking out.
“When a woman is killed, the procedures of the security services are not the same as when it’s a man, the trial is not the same,” said Munzir, the activist.
“Some cases don’t even make it to court. They are subject to tribal resolution between the man’s family and that of his wife, the victim.“

2022-01-12,2022-03-21,Committee set up to identify officers involved in leasing out Monal Restaurant,"Body asked to assess the transparency of bidding process, comparison of rent rates offered by the lease.","ISLAMABAD: A four-member committee has been formed by the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to identify officers who were involved in processing and leasing out Monal Restaurant and other buildings in the protected area of Margalla Hills National Park (MHNP). 
This has been done in compliance with the orders of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Jan 12, 2022. According to a notification issued by the CDA’s Confidential Wing, the committee is supposed to complete its task within 15 days “so that disciplinary proceedings could be initiated against the delinquent officers/officials”.
Sources in the wing said Deputy Director General Land and Estate Afnan Alam would head the committee while Deputy Financial Adviser Khawaja Aizad Hussain, Director Laboratory Khalid Nawaz and Director Regional Planning Fraz Malik will be its members.

Body asked to assess transparency of bidding process, comparison of rent rates offered by the lease and accepted by the then CDA administration

The notification of the committee, which was issued on March 10, and is available with Dawn, tasked the committee to “identify officer involved in processing/leasing of land/structure of Monal Restaurant in the protected area of National Park in violation of the Act of 1997, Ordinance of 1960, Ordinance of 1966, Ordinance of 1979 and the regulations made under the respective statutes”.
According to the terms of reference (TORs), the committee has been given the task to identify factors behind construction of Monal Restaurant and other buildings in the protected area as it was in violation of various acts and ordinances.
The committee has been directed to “assess the transparency of bidding process for leasing of Monal to a private entity and comparison of rent rates offered by the lease and accepted by the then CDA administration with the then market prices for facilities of similar size and nature, identify/mention relevant provision of laws and regulations, infringed while allowing construction/lease of the Monal Resturant and to ascertain the loss/ damages to wildlife, flora and fauna and environmental changes in National Park due to said construction of the restaurant”.
While hearing a petition related to Monal Restaurant, the IHC in January this year had ordered the CDA and Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) to seal the building and start proceedings against other buildings that were operating in the national park in violation of rules.
Following the said orders, the CDA and ICT administration sealed the restaurant.
However, the Supreme Court on March 9, suspended the Jan 11 IHC judgement of sealing and taking over possession of the restaurant.
“The unsigned order of the IHC will remain suspended,” ordered a three-judge Supreme Court bench headed by Justice Ijazul Ahsan. Consequently, Monal Restaurant was de-sealed.
The court, which had taken up the appeal of Monal Group of Companies, pointed out why no action was taken against the other 13 restaurants situated in close proximity of Monal and why Monal was discriminated against only and on what basis, its possession was taken over without the certified copy of the high court.
The IHC had ordered the CDA and IWMB to take over forthwith the possession of the restaurant and seal its premises, subject to allowing its owner/management to take out their property. 
The CDA, after construction of the restaurant, had leased it out to a private firm for 15 years and the lease agreement expired last year. 
However, a few years before the expiry of agreement, the lessee started paying rent to the military, which stated that the land where Monal was constructed belonged to them in accordance with a notification issued in 1912.
IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah rejected the military ownership’s claim over the land and ordered recovery of all the rent paid by the Monal Restaurant management. 
The court had also asked the defence ministry to ensure that the amount received as rent was deposited in the exchequer.
“The claim of Remount, Veterinary and Farms Directorate of Pakistan Army, regarding 8,068 acres of land in the notified national park area is in 
violation of the Ordinance of 1979, read with the Ordinance of 1960, and the [Islamabad] Master Plan,” the IHC had declared.
The IHC chief justice had also directed civic agencies to seal the sprawling naval golf course located in the national park area and unless an environmentally-friendly use can be found for it, ordered its demolition within four weeks.
A senior CDA officer confirmed that the inquiry committee had been formed and added that the committee was yet to hold its first meeting.

The statement of traffic police stated that SSP Rai Mazhar proposed to the Capital Development Authority to make the highway signal free.
The project has saved Rs7.5 billion as instead of constructing overhead bridges, the corridor was made signal free by constructing protected U-turns. 
The data of the police showed that over 115,000 vehicles enter and leave from Islamabad Chowk to Zero Point. As they will travel on the signal-free corridor, it will save around 100,000 man hours of people.
On an average four people travel in a vehicle so if each vehicle saves 15 minutes the entire saving of time of four persons will be one hour, the statement said.
Chief Commissioner Islamabad Amer Ali Ahmed had appreciated the proposal of SSP traffic and directed immediate implementation of the proposal. 
Now the Srinagar Highway has been made signal free by constructing three protective U-turns that connected Islamabad and Rawalpindi with the new airport.
All foreign guests and dignitaries use this road while travelling to and from the airport.
The duration of the travel to Islamabad airport would reduce to half.
This will help solve traffic jam by 60 to 70pc while travelling time to Islamabad airport will also reduce considerably, the SSP (Traffic) said.

2022-03-20,2022-03-21,Islamabad sees decline in Covid-19 mortality rate,Fafen’s findings stress the need for continued vigilance,"ISLAMABAD: As vaccination against Covid-19 has surpassed the figure of 90pc in the federal capital, the city has seen a reduction in mortality rate.
According to data, only 133 cases were reported in the city during the last one week, with the positivity ratio remaining at 1pc. 
On the other hand, Rawalpindi reported five positive cases on Sunday.
In another development, the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) launched a report on Sunday that covered Pakistan’s Covid-19 response during January-February 2022.

Fafen’s findings stress the need for continued vigilance

During the last few weeks, the fifth wave of the pandemic has been losing severity in the country, which can be gauged from the fact that the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) has decided to lift all restrictions for fully-vaccinated people.
Talking to Dawn, District Health Officer Islamabad Dr Zaeem Zia said though the city had surpassed the figure of 90pc, in terms of complete vaccination, it should be considered around 95pc as a number of residents of the city were outside the country.
“The reduced mortality rate shows credibility of vaccination in the city. Despite the fact that Islamabad has a large number of medical tourism, the mortality rate is almost zero,” he added.
While sharing the weekly data, Dr Zia said in the last week of January, the city observed the highest positivity rate of 16.45pc which then gradually started to decline, reaching 1pc during the last week.
The data showed that on Sunday, the capital reported 21 Covid-19 patients and the infection rate of 1.32pc.
Meanwhile,five people tested positive in Rawalpindi district and four recovered during the last 24 hours.
According to the health authority’s data, the positivity ratio in the district was 0.56pc. A total of 892 samples were collected out of which results of 887 people came back negative.
There are 76 active patients in Rawalpindi district as of March 20, with three patients admitted to hospitals and 73 home isolated.
Two patients surfaced from the cantonment areas and one patient each from Kallar Syedan, Taxila and Islamabad. There is no patient on ventilator, however one is on oxygen and the other two are stable.
On the other hand, a report of the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) has observed varying healthcare capacities across regions and districts during the fifth wave of Covid-19 that remained a major challenge and key concern.
With the onset of Omicron variant in December last year, confirmed cases jumped to 133,839 in January – the highest since the start of the pandemic – while the number of recoveries was recorded at 38,366.
Compared to January, cases started to decline in February. The health authorities recorded 79,855 confirmed cases and 147,548 recoveries in the month.
Fafen’s findings of the third pandemic governance monitoring report, released on Sunday, reinforced the need for consistent and continued vigilance and the necessity of both medium and long-term structural and policy changes built on the lessons learnt.
Compared to the earlier waves, the report highlighted a broad two-pronged pandemic response to the fifth surge of Covid-19 that helped Pakistan withstand and manage the challenges relatively well.
The first aspect of the response comprised varying levels of restrictions and targeted measures in areas with high positivity ratio.
The second wave comprised a parallel push for increased vaccination and broadening the eligible population section to include the 12-16 age group. A remarkable increase of 30 million to the fully vaccinated column during the first two months of the ongoing year is a testament to the seriousness accorded to the effort, the report said. 
Despite a slow start, Pakistan’s vaccination drive gained significant momentum, reaching an average of one million doses per day by the end of last year.
Pakistan had administered 216.9 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine by the first week of March 2022. Approximately 100 million people were fully vaccinated (65pc of the vaccine eligible population and 44pc of the total estimated population), whereas around 127.5 million are ‘partially vaccinated’ as per the information provided by the NCOC website and their official twitter account.
As assessed in the report, had the Omicron variant been as severe as the earlier variants, it would have seriously tested the healthcare system — a factor that shall not be lost on policymakers responsible for responding to any new variant of Covid-19 or a completely new pandemic.
For instance, the availability of beds, ventilators and doctors within the observed districts showed that the healthcare system in Pakistan was still under-equipped — more so in some areas than others.
If the situation had necessitated the hospitalisation of those infected, the number of patients per ventilator and patients per bed would have resulted in severe consequences for some of the districts.
For instance, Karak district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa would have 21,132 and 1,023 patients per ventilator and bed respectively, followed by Mardan with 669 patients per ventilator and 324 patients per bed, and Rawalpindi with 204 patients per ventilator and four patients per bed.
The private sector has played a significant role in providing services and facilities that have contributed to the overall pandemic governance and response. However, there remains the need for more effective regulation, especially regarding the pricing of critical services.
However, what remains a key concern for the government is the issue of price regulation.
Attendants of patients interviewed at various health facilities highlighted the significant variance in test pricing. The respondents claimed to have paid prices ranging between Rs1,000 and Rs15,000 or more.

The department’s director, Mohammad Shahid, Deputy Director Haseeb Khalid, District Health Authority Chief Executive Dr Jawad Elahi, Medical Social Welfare Officer Hafiz Mohammad Zubair, PTI’s focal person for Attock Khawar Bukhari and other notables of the area were present on the occasion.

Says annual budget for medical social welfare raised from Rs1.3 million to Rs3.8m

Mr Bukhari said the annual budget for the medical social welfare had been raised from Rs1.3 million to Rs3.8 million, adding that the Punjab government had allocated Rs600 million for social welfare centres across the province.
“Besides, special Quran and Braille printers are being provided free-of-cost to differently-abled people. The social welfare department has also issued the Special Persons Act under his supervision which has been appreciated by the high court while measures are being taken for the welfare of transgender persons,” he added.
A sum of Rs45 million had been allocated for the upgradation and enhancement of different training facilities across the province while the sale of products manufactured there also rose to Rs1.2 million during the current fiscal year, he said, adding that the provincial government had allocated Rs231 million for establishment of seven shelter homes in different parts of the province including Dera Ghazi Khan, Bahawalpur, Sargodha, Multan, Faisalabad and Sahiwal. 
He said an educational institute for differently-abled people called ‘Nasheman’ is being inaugurated on March 31, adding that the Mother and Child Care Hospital would be completed at a cost of Rs5 million next fiscal year. 
He said the nursing school would be upgraded to a nursing college so students of the area did not have to travel to other cities. A blood bank will also be set up in the hospital to facilitate thalassemia patients, he added.

Talking to Dawn, the minister said a fully funded Annual Development Programme (ADP) of Rs1.4 billion was approved for the construction of the university campus. He said the project was the joint ownership of the city as locals contributed funds towards raising different buildings.
The foundation of UoC was laid by Prime Minister Imran Khan near Balkasar area two years ago, which is nearing completion, Mr Sarfraz said.
The request for establishment of the city campus was also submitted to the Punjab government so that students of Chakwal city did not travel 16km to Balkasar daily, he said.
The PC-I for the city campus has been approved and Rs1.4 billion allocated for the construction of the campus, the minister said.
“Two academic blocks, an admin block and male and female hostels would be built and renovation carried out with the fund,” the provincial minister said, adding that construction of the city campus would be completed by 2024.
“The Ministry of Higher Education was my favourite portfolio that has played a constructive role in the establishment of a public university in Chakwal. The engineering campus of the university in Balkasar is under construction and is expected to finish by the next year,” Mr Sarfraz said.
“Campuses of the university would be spread in different areas of Chakwal including Chakwal city, Balkasar and Murid. Land is being acquired in Murid area of Chakwal for construction of several facilities. The vision for this university is to have 30,000-40,000 students and to be an exemplary university of the Rawalpindi Division,” he said, adding that there was no major public university in the division like Lahore, Multan and Faisalabad.
He said: “Many intelligent female students from different areas of Chakwal were deprived of higher education as they were not allowed to get admissions in far-off cities. Now, those students would benefit the most as they can get higher education near their homes. To further create educational facilities for female students who cannot study in co-educational institutions due to conservative backgrounds, female government colleges in Chakwal and Talagang have been affiliated with the UoC and upgraded for BS programmes.”

In a letter to City Police Officer (CPO) Omer Saeed Malik, the provincial committee expressed its concern over the menace of celebratory firing and suggested that strict action needed to be taken by the police.
In its recent meeting, the committee discussed preventive measures related to March 23, 2022, when an increased number of aircraft will be flying from different Pakistan Air Force (PAF) bases. Safe flying operations during the fly past are of utmost importance, the members emphasised.

Provincial committee had expressed concern over the menace, suggested strict police action

It was also recommended that the authorities concerned conduct regular surveys and take swift action against all garbage dumps and place a strict ban on wasting food and other similar items, especially within 12 to 15 kilometres around airfields and airports.
Bird control is the responsibility of the airport management since bird shooters are deployed in the area, particularly near runways, and other preventative steps usually need to be taken to avoid any mishap.
“Since celebratory firing has become a real menace to the security of airspace, strict action has to be taken against it,” the committee stated, adding that a survey of marriage halls should be conducted and it should be made sure that there is no celebratory fire in the wake of important events taking place at the venue of the March 23 fly past and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) council of foreign ministers conference.
The CPO Rawalpindi was also asked to take strict action against firing in the air and to submit a report to the office of commissioner Rawalpindi on a fortnightly basis.
The Punjab government had already asked law enforcement agencies to execute Section 144 and devise a strategy to implement a policy on pigeon homing, kite flying, use of laser lights and drones near airbases and airports.
Following the increasing trend of kite flying, the PBHCC had been formed in March 2020 which had held its first meeting under the chair of the chief secretary of Punjab in Lahore.
Besides monitoring celebratory firing, the district police have been taking strict action against kite flyers and have seized a number of kites and arrested many sellers during ongoing crackdown.
When asked about the security level put in place in the city regarding defence day, the CPO said: “The security has been placed at red-alert level, though there has been no specific threat but we are not taking it lightly as doing all possible security measures, including conducting search operations, specifically in border areas.”
All the stake holders had been intimated by the committee to nominate their representatives for the other committee so that effective measures should be taken to prevent celebratory firing.

The PML-N Rawalpindi chapter also warned Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed that its workers would make his entry into Rawalpindi difficult.
In a meeting of party workers on Sunday, PML-N Metropolitan President and former mayor Sardar Naseem said Sheikh Rashid Ahmed was the biggest ‘lota’ (turncoat) who had ditched PML-N when Gen Pervez Musharraf came into power.

“Once the workers decide to ban your entry, you (Sheikh Rashid) will not be able to enter Lal Haveli,” Mr Naseem said.
He said his party had told workers and supporters to get ready for the power show in Islamabad on March 27 and protect the parliamentarians from PTI’s goons.
The meeting decided that women workers would provide protection to the party’s women lawmakers and youth wing to the party’s leadership on March 27.
It also asked the party’s supporters to bring at least 200 people from each union council.
All union council chairmen will lead their separate rallies and join the main rally led by Hanif Abbasi and Sardar Naseem in the city and Malik Abrar and Daniyal Chaudhry in the cantonment areas.
Talking to Dawn, Mayor Sardar Naseem said his party’s workers would welcome the rally led by Maryam Nawaz and Hamza Shehbaz and join them on their way to Islamabad.
“All party workers and supporters will go to Islamabad in the shape of rallies led by former MNA Hanif Abbasi, former MPAs Raja Hanif, Ziaullah Shah and others. Women wing, youth wing, student federation and minority and labour wings will bring their separate rallies,” Mr Naseem said.
He said the PML-N had finalised the plan to counter arrest and if the interior ministry tried to sabotage their peaceful rally, party workers from every street and area of the garrison city would foil its attempt.
“Rawalpindi is the fort of the PML-N which can be seen from the results of the local government elections in the cantonment areas from where not a single PTI member got elected,” he added.
He said in the last three years, the PTI government had done nothing for the residents of Rawalpindi and now Imran Khan had threatened to bring people to Islamabad.
“In Rawalpindi, many PTI local leaders are contacting PML-N as they want to join the party,” he claimed.

2022-03-31,2022-03-21,Over 50pc independent female candidates contesting local govt polls in KP,ISLAMABAD: The independent women contestants outnumbered the combined tally of women candidates fielded by the...,"ISLAMABAD: The independent women contestants outnumbered the combined tally of women candidates fielded by the political parties for the Neighborhood and Village Councils in the second phase of local government elections being held in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) on March 31.
Overall, the independent female candidates constitute 51pc as against 27pc and 22pc women fielded by liberal and religious parties respectively.
This was revealed by Pattan, an NGO that works for democracy, human rights and gender equality in a report released here on Sunday.
It said reserved seats remained vacant or being won without any contest, a phenomenon that had also been seen in the first phase of the polls.
According to Pattan, lack of political will appears to be mainly responsible for low rate of female participation in local elections.
The second phase of local election shows that on an average only 1.76 female candidates are in the field against one seat, while seat to candidate ratio on other categories of seats is much high. For instance, on average there are 10 candidates against one seat for chairmen/mayor category.
Pattan argues that prior conditions (female literacy rate, human development level, women’s participation in labour force and access to public life, etc.,) appear to have played a major role in determining the level of women’s participation in the election.
Because of the existing differentiation, women’s participation as candidates varies from district to district. For instance, in Lower and Upper Kohistan – extremely poor and underdeveloped districts --about 90pc women seats remained vacant. 
In Battagram, out of total 90 female seats as many as 71 or 79pc remained vacant.
In South Waziristan too, more than 68pc of female seats remained vacant, while in Abbottabad, only 32 or 15pc of the 209 seats are vacant. 
In Upper Chitral, female candidates did not leave a single seat vacant.
However, there appears significant variations across districts. 
For instance, share of religious parties is higher than liberal parties in six districts - Mansehra 16pc, North Waziristan 36pc and Kurram 36pc, and Orakzai 32%. The liberal parties have clear edge over religious parties in eight districts - Upper Chitral 33pc, Lower Dir 49pc, Malakand 44pc, Shangla 43pc, Swat 50pc and Upper Dir 57pc. 
In 11 districts the independent candidates constitute clear majority in comparison to combined strength of all parties. 
In Abbottabad 88pc, Battagram 94pc, Upper Chitral 56pc, Lower Chitral 64pc, Mansehra 84pc, North Waziristan 53pc, South Waziristan 81pc, Orakzai 56pc, and Shangla 50pc.
Analysis of the contestation data (ECP Form X List of Contesting Candidates) also reveals some interesting socio-political trends:
1) High participation of female candidates even in the conservative or traditional districts than the combined female candidates of political parties is a clear sign of emergence of new social forces that are ready to play an important role in local governance.
2) Political parties appear to be ignorant of their emergence and have little appetite to broaden and deepen democracy and to avail this opportunity.
3) Political parties seem to be more interested in top positions i.e. mayors and chairpersons than in the quota seats of the marginalised sections of the society.
4) As a large number of women seats will remain vacant even after by-election female populations of many Neighborhood and Village Councils of KPK are likely to be deprived of women representatives.
Pattan’s analysis is primarily based on the ECP’s Form X (list of contesting candidates) of 17 districts.
The Pattan in it’s recommendations said the ECP should make available data and forms of every election promptly.
It said political parties need to invest resources to set up party chapters at grassroots level and must also hold internal party election and ECP should monitor their polling processes.
It also said civil society, women groups and trade unions should plan to field candidates against quota seats.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Finding and filling health  gaps digitally,"While various startups addresses a spectrum of challenges, till the net is cast wider and deeper, health tech will not be a...","“A man was having severe heart problems in Loralai, Balochistan,” narrates Dr Sara Saeed Khurram, co-founder of Sehat Kahani. “It was during the peak of the pandemic when the country was under lockdown and access to medical advice, tricky at the best of times in remote areas of Pakistan, had become all the more challenging. But he was able to connect to a doctor through Sehat Kahani and got prescribed the required medicine that helped save his life.”
With a ratio of one doctor for every 1,200 patients, half the population of Pakistan does not have access to basic primary healthcare services. Hand-in-hand is the phenomenon of doctor bahus: women who train medically but for a myriad of reasons are unable to practice in a country that desperately needs more doctors.
Born out of Dr Khurram’s personal experience, Sehat Kahani is a health tech social enterprise that provides a solution to both problems. “I was practicing when I had to shift cities. By chance, I connected to the nurse on duty at my old desk who told me patients were still coming to the clinic but no doctor was available. I started consulting on the phone and eventually got a webcam. Over time the chance encounter evolved into Sehat Kahani,” says Dr Khurram.
Operating through a network of 37 clinics, to date Sehat Kahani has offered 850,000 consultations and employs 7,000 doctors of which 85 per cent are females.

While various startups addresses a spectrum of challenges, till the net is cast wider and deeper, health tech will not be a panacea for all healthcare problems in Pakistan

According to the global health security index 2021, Pakistan is ranked 130 out of 195. From being able to access medical advice to the purchase of genuine medicine to recognising the presence of a disease, there are challenges across the entire process. Digitisation has stepped in to address many of the gaps of which Sehat Kahani is a case in point.
“We have saved six people from committing suicide in Pakistan,” says Syed Naseh, CTO of Saaya Health, a mental health platform. Available in seven languages globally and Urdu, Punjabi, Pashto and Sindhi in Pakistan, Saaya Health has conducted over 4,000 counselling sessions and its social-emotional learning content has reached about 100,000 children.
One in four people in Pakistan suffer from mental health issues. In Karachi, where multi-generational families live in small apartments, one in three suffer from depression and anxiety. And yet, there is a taboo around mental health with those seeking it as perceived to be ‘mad’, explains COO Alizeh Valjee who has a background in psychology.
During the pandemic, relationship issues were exacerbated, increasing domestic violence. The rate of disability and dysfunction increased in those with existing mental health issues along with burnout rates. Stress related to financial insecurities, rise in unemployment and poverty, lack of access to social support and recreational outlets, inability to access the health system during the lockdown and overall anxiety due to uncertainty together made an environment highly conducive to debilitating mental health and holistic wellbeing.
But things are improving, says Mr Naseh. Mental health is becoming less of a taboo, more literature is being produced and more universities are offering psychology cases, he said while giving the example of the recently held Karachi Wellness Festival.
However, all access to healthcare becomes meaningless if the medicines bought to address the illnesses are fake. And Pakistan’s problems with counterfeit drugs is endemic, with some research statistics indicating that 40-50pc of medicine sold are fake.
“We are trying to connect the pharma companies directly to the patient to help eliminate fake medicines from the system,” says Furquan Kidwai, founder and CEO of online pharmacy Dawaai.
There are 500-plus pharmaceutical companies in the country that are manufacturing drugs distributed by 1000-plus distributors through 45,000-plus licensed pharmacies, he explains using numbers to explain how fragmented the market is. This has resulted in the creation of many layers between the pharma company and the end consumer that has allowed one of the biggest counterfeit medicine markets in the world to flourish.
Because of the cryogenic nature of the market, there are about 20,000 unique SKUs (stock-taking units) available for about 500-600 medicines — each medicine is sold under 10-15 different names. “Take Paracetamol as an example. It is sold under 30 different names — Panadol, Paramol, Parasol etc,” he says.
An average shop has say about 200 SKUs so patients have to go through the hassle of visiting multiple pharmacies to get their prescription fulfilled. The pandemic pushed Dawaai’s user adoption rate to 5x-6x, leading to a current growth rate of 9x. 
The health tech numbers are impressive. One source says there are 331 health tech startups in Pakistan, another says telehealth companies grew by 900pc during the pandemic. But this picture is skewed. While various health tech addresses a spectrum of challenges, from menstrual health to setting up appointments with doctors, the ease of access is limited to the relatively affluent that have access to the internet and a basic understanding of technology. Till the net is cast wider and deeper, health tech will not be a panacea for all healthcare problems in Pakistan.

Mr Song Song, Country Manager, Ali Baba

 
For as long as one can remember, Pakistan has been stuck in a perpetual cycle of boom and busts. Ask any minister, finance bro or stock analyst masquerading as an economist the recipe to break free from this and they will tell you increasing exports is the answer. That’s also something Commerce Advisor Abdul Razak Dawood has made a key priority since the first day. 
One such measure his ministry could claim credit for was getting Pakistan placed on the Amazon’s sellers’ list, which we were told would open new avenues for exports for local entrepreneurs. How many of those businesses, mostly used to business-to-business (B2B )contracts, would actually be able to position themselves in the direct-to-consumer (D2C) segment on arguably the most competitive marketplace on the planet was a different matter altogether. 

There are more than 3,000 Pakistani sellers on Alibaba.com with close to 90pc of them coming from Sialkot

Meanwhile, a few thousand businesses from the country had focused their energies eastward towards Alibaba.com. In fact, Pakistan now ranks the highest in terms of paid sellers on the world’s largest B2B e-commerce platform’s Global Business. Since 2017-18, the number of Pakistani sellers on the platform has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent, according to a presentation the company presented to a roundtable at the Board of Investment’s recent conference. 
“There are more than 3,000 Pakistani sellers on Alibaba.com with close to 90pc of them coming from Sialkot,” says Mr Song Song, the company’s country manager for Pakistan. And now he wants to expand the platform’s reach to traders and businesses in other cities, especially the export-oriented ones like Faisalabad and Gujranwala, in addition to Karachi and Lahore. For that purpose, he and his team have been increasing their outreach efforts through awareness sessions at the various chambers of commerce and industries. 
“Apparel is the most popular category among Pakistani sellers, followed by sports goods and surgical equipment given that the majority of our users are from Sialkot,” he shares. According to the ‘Digital B2B Outlook 2022 Pakistan’ published by Alibaba at the beginning of the year, 63pc of the sellers are in the apparel category while a total of 3.2 million listings have been made from the country so far. But how much does that translate into dollar terms? “Unfortunately even we don’t know the gross merchandise value of goods sold from the country on our platform,” Mr Song Song says. 
That’s strange, isn’t it? Maybe at first. As a B2B e-commerce platform facilitating cross-border trade across hundreds of geographies, Alibaba.com is used by many buyers and sellers for discovery and information before actually negotiating the deal between themselves. “Outside China, the US and Malaysia, the transactions still take place offline so it becomes difficult for us to estimate the worth of goods sold,” the executive explains. 
The reason behind that is, of course, the complicated nature of B2B payments which is made even more complex due to the cross-border nature of transactions. “It’s not like B2C where the average order value would be a few dollars. You are talking hundreds of thousands or even a million dollars per order which the current infrastructure doesn’t allow for in Pakistan. And payments are just one component of it; there’s also fulfilment, integration with customs authorities etc. That entire ecosystem needs to be built,” Mr Song Song says.  
In that case, who else to build the ecosystem other than Alibaba.com — the most successful B2B e-commerce platform? “It requires huge amounts of investments as well as time. In China, it took us around five years to develop it,” he says. Before the company embarks on such an ambitious plan, it first wants to create a local presence and create more awareness among the sellers. 
“We are going to set up a local entity for Alibaba.com, the first such for any of the companies of the Alibaba Group [excluding Daraz and Easypaisa as they were acquisitions], and build an on-ground team in Pakistan for functions like customer service, outreach and marketing by the end of the calendar year,” Mr SongSong shares. This is along with growing their channel partners — currently numbering 10 — who currently act as the e-commerce platform’s representatives in the country and help onboard new users and provide support to the existing ones.

2021-07-27,2022-03-21,Hasty growth in housing finance,The euphoric demand for housing finance and a liberal supply of loans remains subject to ground reality checks.,"Agriculture and housing loans — along with micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) finance — are vital for boosting economic activity. And, if banks start lending more to all the three sectors at the same time, that almost guarantees accelerated GDP growth in the short-to-medium term. 
Currently, though, banks are not wholesomely engaged in such an exercise. But the government and the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) are trying to promote just that. Policies introduced for accelerating housing loans offer an added advantage to the government — they make room for politically-motivated tax amnesty in the name of the documentation of the economy. The ongoing Naya Pakistan Housing Programme (NPHP) is no exception.
Regardless of the fact that this is opening yet another avenue under this programme for the whitening of tax-evaded money, housing loans being offered under NPHP are quite promising. Already, they have reactivated the real estate and building construction sector and continue to enliven demand for outputs of dozens of allied industries and services sub-sectors. Their impact on the overall economy (rebased to 2015-16) is already being felt and is sure to become more and more pronounced with the passage of time. That is if future governments let the programme continue in its current form and spirit.

The euphoric demand for housing finance and liberal supply of loans remains subject to ground reality checks after the expiry of the tax amnesty scheme 

Within seven months of this fiscal year (ie between July 2021 and Jan 2022), banks disbursed fresh consumers loans of Rs47.6 billion for the construction of buildings. In addition to this, they also disbursed Rs11.8bn loans to their employees for the same purpose.
Thus, overall lending for construction of buildings in the first seven months of this fiscal year totalled Rs59.4bn, the latest SBP stats reveal. During the same period of the last fiscal year, total lending for housing buildings was too small — Rs7.9bn for general consumers and Rs22bn for bank employees or a total of Rs29.9bn! 
The demand for housing finance remained strong right from the beginning of this fiscal year partly because builders were using tax-evaded money for launching new housing projects following extension in the tax amnesty scheme. Partly, higher economic growth in 2021-21 compared to that of 2019-20 also motivated people to take advantage of the Naya Pakistan Housing Programme made easier this year — and apply for housing loans. 
So, the volumes of housing finance offered so far could have been larger had banks been able to process loans applications a bit more speedily. The PTI government, challenged on all fronts and struggling for its survival, is pushing banks to their limits through the central bank to accelerate the disbursement of housing loans. So, one can hope that the volumes of fresh housing loans would grow even faster in near future, more so because the “no-question asked” status of the investment coming into this sector has been extended — once again — to the end of FY22 in June.

The overall lending for construction of buildings in the first seven months of this fiscal year totalled Rs59.4bn while during the same period last fiscal year, total lending for housing buildings was Rs7.9bn for general consumers and Rs22bn for bank employees or a total of Rs29.9bn

Growth in housing finance and underlying expansion in construction activities continue to fuel growth in allied sectors as well. During July-Dec 2021, manufacturing of iron and steel grew by 18.4 per cent, whereas in the same period of 2020 this sub-sector of large-scale manufacturing had contracted by 12.1pc, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics. 
Monthly cement production which was below 3.7 million tonnes in July 2021 gradually picked up and peaked at 4.48m tonnes in October before coming down to 4.3m tonnes and 4m tonnes in November and December respectively, due to a dramatic rise in the cost of production of coal-fired cement plants after skyrocketing of coal prices in international markets — and not due to slackness in demand. 
To meet the increasing demand for housing finance, and particularly to meet the demand for low-cost housing, the SBP has now eased prudential regulations of microfinance banks. “The changes made in the prudential regulations include additional guidance on property assessment, mortgage creation and risk management,” the central bank announced on March 16. By end of 2021, total lending already made in the housing sector stood at Rs20bn — the number of beneficiaries was 75,000, an SBP press release said.
Moving forward, accelerated disbursement of housing finance through microfinance banks can be expected to boost volumes of financing and enhance the number of loan takers. But whether microfinance loans for housing can actually lead to the construction of new low-cost housing units is doubtful. These loans are likely to end up for purchasing already constructed flats and one-unit residential units or for the renovation of existing houses and apartments. 
The current euphoric demand for housing finance from commercial banks and an equally liberal supply of housing loans remain subject to ground reality checks after the expiry of the tax amnesty scheme in June. If tax amnesty for investment in the housing sector is allowed to expire on time — and not extended any further — construction of new houses and apartments may come to a halt. But that perhaps doesn’t bother the government. 
Another worrisome aspect of the housing finance euphoria is that banks are offering housing loans to their employees, particularly senior executives, a bit too liberally. The central bank needs to watch mortgage finance to bank employees closely to ward off any possible development of banks-builders nexus. Powerful builders particularly those with strong links with politicians and the establishment have successfully circumvented banking and environmental laws in the past for the construction of prized projects both in Karachi and Islamabad. Some of them still continue to do this. 
While making more housing loans, banks must also focus on ensuring their sustainability in terms of market risks and the risk of defaults.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,The challenges of the electronic warehouse receipt system,"If run professionally and efficiently, it may reduce pressure on farmers to sell their produce in panic immediately ...","The resource-constraint smallholder farmers are unattractive candidates for credit from formal financial institutions, which tend to ignore them because of their often unpredictable, fragmented and unstructured agricultural activities.
The State Bank of Pakistan, like the central banks of many other developing countries, is introducing schemes to increase access of small farmers to the formal credit channels, saving them from exploitation by informal money lenders.
The SBP, in this respect, has recently launched the electronic warehouse receipt (EWR) system for maize crop in Kasur district, almost a year after the scheme was introduced for paddy crop in Hafizabad, another central Punjab district. The EWR enables the depositor, whether a producer or dealer, of an agriculture commodity to use it as collateral for obtaining bank loans or trade in commodity markets, if and when the system is linked with the commodities exchange as well.
If run professionally and efficiently, it may also reduce pressure on farmers to sell their produce in panic immediately after harvests when prices are normally low. Thus, it may ensure a better return to farmers for their financial and physical investment and also help stabilise market prices. The system may also reduce post-harvest losses as care of the stored commodity is handed over to certified warehouses equipped with the required facilities and expertise.

If run professionally and efficiently, it may reduce pressure on farmers to sell their produce in panic immediately after harvests when prices are normally low while allowing agriculture commodities to be used as collateral for bank loans

However, the insufficient number of certified warehouses complying with preservation norms, lack of awareness among farmers and their limited business skills, and no incentives for buyers to purchase commodities from the warehouses are identified as the stumbling blocks in the expansion of the system.
Afaq Tiwana, a progressive farmer, says the EWR may be beneficial for the community only if the SBP scheme includes a blueprint for bridging the infrastructure (warehouses and logistics) gap. “There is an acute shortage of certified warehouses and reliable logistic facilities that are required to run the system satisfactorily.” He advocates for incentivising the infrastructure building by assuring business for the owners of the storage units the whole year so that they are attracted to invest more and more in the sector.
For this purpose, he argues, the government needs to get out of the business of wheat, the biggest crop of the country. The government is the major player in the wheat market but does not utilise private warehouses depriving them of around six-month business, he says. A mix of wheat, rice and maize crops, etc will ensure the warehouses do business throughout the year because of their different seasons. Mr Tiwana says for food security the government may buy grain from the warehouses if and when required through bidding.
Ibad Khan, president of Guava Growers Association, endorses the views saying by opting for the private warehousing system the government may save non-development expenditures worth billions of rupees consumed by thousands of Food Department employees in the name of salaries and perks, operating costs of their vehicles and buildings, etc “without doing any good”.
“The (provincial) government may buy four million tonnes of wheat from the certified warehouses through the Pakistan Commodities Exchange and lift the grain when needed from there. It will equal a surplus of thousands of food department employees and thus save huge funds required for the functioning of the department, as well as the hassle of checking theft of the crop from its storages by unscrupulous staff.”
Mr Khan thinks the farm produce warehousing concept may gain currency provided the farming community is given proper awareness and the purpose is well served easily by engaging the Agriculture Department’s field staff. “If a farmer learns that by spending Rs50, for instance, as storage rent, his produce will earn Rs100 then he will automatically turn towards the EWR scheme. The extension wing of the Agriculture Department is in close proximity to the rural population and may help mobilise them for it.”
An attractive package to build high-quality warehouses can find 15 to 20 investors in each village ready to build the storage if provided information/guidance about the business scope and initial technical assistance in running the facilities until these become self-sufficient, he asserts.
While the functioning of the facility will benefit the farming community in many ways, Mr Tiwana says the prevailing farm produce trade system is built to make the rich richer. “At present 70 to 80 per cent of commodities are sold at harvesting time in the country. And thus, these fetch lower rates for the farmers. Large processors and the influential (textile, feed, flour millers, etc) have huge amounts of cash at hand and make these purchases knowing that the prices will shoot up within months. Besides value-addition through their mills, they also earn a big profit through commodities trade, robbing millions of farmers of the money that actually belongs to them.”
The EWR facility will save the poor farmers from panic selling as well as stabilise prices in the open market at harvesting time because an adequate quantity of the produce would have been deposited with the warehouses, freeing the market from surplus crops. This would ensure a better return even for those farmers who will be opting to sell their produce in the spot market, he adds.
Mr Khan stresses that the warehousing concept must be linked to the Commodities Exchange for the sake of the sustainability of the system and that the Exchange should be relocated to Punjab, the largest producer of agricultural products so that those involved in active farming have easy access to it. He laments that no farmer association was engaged by the SBP or any other government entity to seek their input for the scheme.
For Amer Hayat Bhandara, a progressive grower from Pakpattan, the EWR facility seems to be working only for those farmers and final buyers who are qualified customers of commercial banks. He points out that one of the most common problems of the farmer is informal debt: farmers take loans from people in the market with personal guarantees and with a condition that the crop will be sold through them.
Will the middlemen allow the farmer to go for the EWR, he questions? Suppose if farmers want to do so, then the debt of the middleman will be repaid through EWR, but how will the inputs like seeds, fertilisers, fuel and pesticides for the next crop be acquired?

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Business leaders and sleepless nights,It’s time to lie low as there is no chance of any clarity till the no-confidence move is over.,"


 
THE critical domains of the economy and foreign affairs have taken a back seat as the political leadership has been left to scramble for continuing in power. This seems to be rather dicey in a world that is trying to deal with fragile energy markets and food security in its Covid-battered existence, and global peace in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
In addition to tales of human sufferings, the war has disturbed global commodity markets, disrupted supply chains, hiked freight charges and posed challenges to the global financial system after the West slapped harsh sanctions on Russia and excluded it from the SWIFT system of money transfers. Experts and economists have predicted slower growth and an increase in inflation worldwide.   
Instead of strategising to deal with the evolving global challenges, Islamabad appears to be too busy to care. Global experts have included Pakistan amongst the more vulnerable nations where the impact of the fallout of war is expected to be severe owing to the resource-deficient country’s dependence on oil, gas and edible imports.

It’s time to lie low as there is no chance of any clarity till the no-confidence move is over

Just as the masses are doing, businesses are also watching closely the events unfolding at a bewildering pace under the full glare of the media spotlight. With the final outcome not quite certain, the whole saga is keeping business houses unnerved.
The common man is desperately waiting for the debilitating economic stress to ease off to the extent that it possibly can, while the business class is dreading a hostile reaction of the West to the hard stance of the government towards the US and Europe. The handshake images of Prime Minister Imran Khan and President Putin in Moscow on the day Russia launched its attack on Ukraine has already placed the country in an awkward position. 
Some like to project the current situation in Pakistan as the expected manifestation of civil unrest over inflation and job losses, while others link it to be the outcome of deeper structural imbalance. And then there are those who see the struggle rooted in efforts to uphold the supremacy of civilian leadership. 
Argumentative Pakistanis can debate the politics, but they all agree that the economy and its challenges have taken a back seat for now and things will be difficult irrespective of the final outcome of the no-confidence motion in parliament.
The leading lights of business class, when approached for a comment, were evasive. Afraid to land on the wrong side of the current or the future set of rulers, they shared their disappointment with the political class privately, saying it was frustrating to watch the politicians “stoop too low whenever tested”. 
A senior business leader commented” “Prime Minister Imran Khan and his confidants are inciting violence much like Trump did in the US. How can they not understand the consequences? If politicians fail to resist the temptation to take their conflict out of parliament it can make the country drift towards anarchy. Yes, we are worried for our businesses, but we are more concerned about the safety and security of our family and the future of this country.” 
Musadaq Zulqarnain, of Interloop fame, believed that “irrespective of the outcome of the vote in parliament or the movement on the streets, the economy is not in a good shape. It will get worse because of political turbulence which will be followed by popular measures to please the masses without fundamental corrections. 
“Pakistan needs a sustained growth of 7-8 per cent for several years, powered by an increase in exports if it wants to come out of its economic troubles. The only solution is a consensus document — the Charter of Economy — which must be vigorously followed irrespective of the party in power,” he said.
Nasser Hayat Magoon, former president of the Federation of Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), said the troubles had aggravated in the last couple of years. The budget, he thought, has failed to spark much interest among the legislators. In his opinion, it is influenced by “a select group of businessmen that encircles the leadership”. 
Sources in the Ministry of Finance told Dawn that the budget exercise initiated in January has been in progress at the routine pace. 
Pulling out his wish-list, Mr Magnoon said: “The FPCCI suggested simplification of taxation, which was promised but was resisted by the tax bureaucracy. We do not expect a business-friendly budget. The timing of the budget will be contingent on how the present chaotic political situation settles.” 
He said the private sector needs to communicate with political parties and sensitise them to the variety of problems that are being faced by businesses. He warned that street agitation in the current charged environment may have serious consequences. 
Mian Anjum Nisar, another business leader, lamented the lack of clarity in politics, while Majyd Aziz was critical of mismatched priorities of successive governments. 
Regardless of the concerns voiced by the business community, everybody realises that at least in the short term, there is no chance of any clarity till the no-confidence move is over.

2022-07-27,2022-03-21,Auto parts — setting a new record for imports,New entrants are rolling out vehicles with mere 5pc locally made parts which is insufficient to reduce foreign exchange burden.,"Pakistan’s import bill for completely and semi-knocked down (CKD/SKD) kits for cars imported by local assemblers has crossed one billion dollars in just eight months of 2021-22 which is significantly higher than the record high bill of $1.12 billion for the entire of FY21.
The 8MFY22 ended with $1.102bn as compared to $557 million in the same period last fiscal. 
The low levels of localisation by Chinese and Korean investors under Auto Policy 2016-2021 for five years as well as in the new models by existing assemblers have played a key role in boosting the import bill.
As per data of the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the new and old entrants brought CKD/SKD kits worth $4.987bn from 2016-2017 to July-February 2021-2022, thus nullifying claims of achieving higher localisation.
Sources said that the new entrants have started rolling out vehicles from their assembly lines with a mere five per cent locally made parts which is insufficient to reduce the burden on the foreign exchange. 

New entrants are rolling out vehicles with mere five per cent locally made parts which is insufficient to reduce the burden on the foreign exchange rate

Assemblers are now in top gear as the eight months of FY22 ended with a whooping sales jump of 57.5pc in cars to 149,813 units. They are also excited over huge bookings in hands whose delivery time ranges between three months to 11 months. Jeeps and pickups sales have also surged by 51.5pc in 8MFY22 to 28,437 units.
Huge demand for cars has led to a massive jump in CKD/SKD imports to $1.120bn in FY21 from $478mn in FY20, up by 134pc thanks to low-interest rates and attractive auto financing by the banks till the third quarter of 2021
However, curbs on auto financing from the last quarter of 2021, persistent increase in car prices and long delays in delivery appear to have not hurt the buyers’ sentiments in the last eight months, while buyers are also satisfied over the rising resale value of the vehicles owing to months’ long delivery timings, soaring prices and on-money for vehicles for immediate delivery. 
The import bill of CKD/SKD was $660m in FY17 which later swelled to $809m in FY18 and then remained at $818mn in FY19. The fiscal year 2019-2020 was a bad year for the entire country due to the flare-up in Covid-19 from March to June followed by the government’s decision to close down the industrial units in April 2020. As a result, the FY20 import bill of CKD/SKD was just $478m.
Stakeholders had been trumpeting 70pc localisation in Suzuki Mehran which ruled the roads for over 30 years without significant model change. After the end of the iconic Mehran journey in 2018, the claim of achieving higher localisation by stakeholders has now been confined to 55-60pc in various existing Japanese models and 35-45pc in new models. 
It seems that no serious efforts have been made by the existing Japanese assemblers in the old and new models to improve the utilisation levels  of locally made parts in vehicles.
A vendor, who asked not to be named, said the import bill of CKD/SKD would remain under pressure as the new entrants, who had approved their projects under the Auto Policy 2016-2021, would enjoy a honeymoon period for the next four to five years to keep rolling out vehicles with negligible local content. Besides, new models by the existing Japanese assemblers will also take time in improving local content in the vehicles.
He said vendors had asked the government not to allow vehicles’ assembly of higher engine power under tAuto Policy 2016-2021. The new entrants, instead of introducing small cars below 800cc, shifted their focus towards the assembly of high engine power sports utility vehicles (SUV) whose numbers are growing every day.
Chief Operating Officer, Balochistan Wheel Limited (BWL), Muhammad Irfan Ghani in a letter to the CEO Engineering Development Board (EDB) said the EDB is the custodian of the auto vending industry which encourages the localisation of auto parts.
The auto sector in Pakistan is now more than 50 years old but the assemblers have not done localisation seriously, he complained.
He said the pace of localisation of auto parts is too slow due to the discouraging attitudes and lengthy procedures adopted by the assemblers which form a monopoly for their foreign principals. They protect their own interests to use their CKD parts and have made localisation very  difficult. 
Mr Ghani said the country’s precious foreign exchange is being wasted due to non-localisation while many assemblers are not taking parts from the local vendors in some of their newly launched models.
The matter came up for discussion during the first meeting of the Auto Industry Development and Export Committee (AIDEC) held on March 8, 2022, which was attended by the auto stakeholders and officials of the relevant ministries. The AIDEC meeting had decided that the EDB would schedule a joint meeting between Baluchistan Wheels and Pak Suzuki to resolve the matter.
However, AIDEC committee members reiterated that the localisation of parts and components must be pursued in letter and spirit. 
Former Chairman Pakistan Association of Parts and Accessories Manufacturers (Paapam), Abdul Rahman Aizaz attributed the rising import bill of CKD to the massive revival in sales of cars and SUVs from the depressed sales scenario of 2019-2020.
Under Auto Policy 2016-2021, most of the new entrants have focused on manufacturing SUVs, which too has resulted in the higher value of CKD imports. He said that sales volumes of new entrants and old players have shown phenomenal growth due to improving economic indicators.
Since the new entrants under Auto Policy 2016-21 can avail the concession on import of CKD for five years, localisation of parts in such vehicles, especially of SUVs, is in the catching-up phase, he added.
Mr Aizaz said that the unprecedented surge in international prices of various resins and metals, rupee devaluation against the dollar and multiple times higher freight charges have further enhanced the landed cost of almost all raw materials.

2022-02-27,2022-03-21,Surviving tough times,"Regardless of who wins and who loses the no-trust motion, the government will not find it easy to handle the economy.","The rupee hit its lowest ever of over 180 to a dollar in the interbank market on the weekend as the shares market continues to decline. 
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) appears largely satisfied with the PTI government’s explanation of the Rs346 billion relief package announced late last month in an apparent attempt to appease the inflation-stricken households. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) kept the key policy rate unchanged at 9.75 per cent but its warning that it could advance the next Monetary Policy Committee meeting to raise the interest rates if need be has pushed cut-off yields in the last public sector debt auction.
The political instability in the wake of a no-confidence motion submitted by the opposition to oust the prime minister is forcing the government to take populist measures that it might not have if it weren’t facing the existential threat from the opposition political parties that have come together to push Imran Khan out of power in spite of their deep divisions. 

Regardless of who wins and who loses the no-trust motion, the government will not find it easy to handle the economy — many hard decisions will have to be made

No one expected the Kaptaan to go away without fighting till the last ball, but the last week’s events in Islamabad have spawned fears of violence. The storming of the Parliament Lodges, where the opposition lawmakers were housed by police commandos and counter-terrorism force was followed by the attack of the PTI workers on Sindh House in Islamabad. It happened after the opposition gave media access to the place to interview dissident parliamentarians of the ruling party. 
The ruling party’s insistence to gather a million people outside the parliament in the event of the vote on the no-confidence resolution and the threats being tossed around by the ministers has forced the opposition political parties to make their own plans to counter the move. Indeed, everyone expected the prime minister to fight back — but not in this way. 
The situation is fluid and may likely continue for several weeks to come, with its impact expected to reverberate for many months. Regardless of who wins and who loses the no-trust motion, the government will not find it easy to handle the economy. Many tough decisions will have to be made. If the opposition succeeds in de-seating the prime minister, it will have its work cut out for them. 
The first job would be to approach the IMF to release the next tranche to shore up foreign exchange reserves and take the pressure off the home currency. PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has already hinted at renegotiating the deal with the multilateral lender. It is not clear if the Washington-based fund would be more kind to the new government than the Imran Khan administration. 
The second job, the businessmen interviewed by telephone over the weekend say, for whoever — the PTI or the opposition parties — is in power after the vote on the motion would be to mend Pakistan’s relationship with the West, especially the United States. “That does not necessarily mean that we have to dial down our ties with China. Going to Russia when the Kremlin had planned to attack Ukraine was a big foreign policy mistake Imran Khan made. He could have called off the tour and stayed neutral. That would not have brought upon us such pressure from the European Union and the US, with which our relations are already facing problems due to the Taleban takeover of Kabul last summer,” a textile exporter argued. 
“Improvement in our ties with Washington and European capitals is crucial not only for securing some concessions from the IMF but also to get out of the grey list of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).”
A senior executive of a chemical company was of the view that once politics cool down Islamabad will have to reconsider its policy towards India. “If you think you can improve your relationship with the West and get off the FATF’s enhanced monitoring regime without making some kind of headway with New Delhi, you are totally mistaken. I have information that our present military leadership too is in favour of resuming ties with India,” he claimed.
However, there are others who feel that the top priority has to be given to the resolution of domestic political problems. “The settlement of the outstanding issues with the IMF and the western powers is important. But more important is to tackle our domestic problems first. I cannot say if the present government will be in power after a few days or not. But in my opinion, once this crisis is over, all the parties must sit together and develop a consensus on electoral reforms so that we can have political stability. I think that the government term of five years should be curtailed to four years. We are very impatient people and a kind of fatigue starts to take over us every three to four years. If we manage to clean up our political mess, we will be able to put back the economy on the rails and end our international isolation.”

2022-03-20,2022-03-21,"IMF seeks details of petrol, power subsidy funding",Finance minister makes it clear there are no more outstanding issues as the IMF only wants to ascertain sources of funding.,"


 
ISLAMABAD: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has sought copies of financial agreements with the provincial governments and other details from the federal government to confirm the financing of discounts on electricity and petroleum products announced by Prime Minister Imran Khan, Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin disclosed at a press conference on Sunday.
The talks with the IMF were earlier scheduled to conclude on Friday last but then “they [Fund staff] wanted to see agreements with the provinces to basically reassure we are not involved in aerial firing” on financing of PM’s relief package for petroleum prices, the minister said.
Mr Tarin made it clear that there were no more outstanding issues, as they only wanted to ascertain the sources of funding to cover the cost of reduction in electricity and petroleum products. They were assured the package would be covered through provincial shares and dividends of the state-owned entities, he said. “They said show us agreements with the provinces,” he remarked.
The federal government has signed rolling memorandums of understanding with the provinces to provide cash surplus every year to show lower consolidated fiscal deficit but are sometimes remain unhonoured when provinces also go into overdrafts.
“So there is no problem. We already have agreements that we will show them” when the two sides would meet again on Monday, the minister said, adding he would hold a final policy round up with the fund mission on Tuesday. 
The two sides will then finalise the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) amicably and take it to the executive board on a convenient date.
After initial compliance with the commitments made with the IMF in December 2021 to increase petroleum levy and power tariff, PM Khan reversed the progress by announcing Rs10 per litre reduction in petroleum products bringing down levy to zero besides a cut in electricity rates by Rs5 per unit instead of a schedule of increases agreed to with the IMF to address circular debt.
Up to 700,000-tonne wheat import
Responding to a question, Mr Tarin said all the provinces were part of the minimum wheat support price at Rs2,200 per 40 kg approved by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet last week — about 13 per cent higher than Rs1,950 of last year and showed confidence to exceed procurement target that was also set at 6.9 million tonnes last week.
He said the wheat production was then estimated to be 5pc to 6pc higher and may not require imports except 500,000 to 700,000 tonnes for strategic reserves. “I would like to increase strategic reserves from 1.8 million tonnes to two million tonnes, depending on international prices,” he said, adding he would not burn foreign exchange if international wheat prices remain higher.
In response to a question about former PML-N finance minister Miftah Ismail’s statement that the country could not launch international bonds as Pakistan’s bond yields had gone high due to economic policies and fundamentals, Mr Tarin said his statement would not change ground reality. This was not Pakistan specific but with entire developing countries including Turkey, Indonesia and others, he remarked.
Mr Tarin said financing was not an issue but the interest rates being offered were higher. He said he still had $4-5bn worth of offers from banks, but “why should I take expensive loans?” Mr Miftah should also recall they had left the government with just one-month import financing that now stood at $16.6bn – against average monthly imports of about $7bn in eight months, he added.
Responding to a question whether he would continue as finance minister in the next government if asked, Mr Tarin said he was a man of principles and would at no cost do that as he was a PTI senator. “I will remain finance minister if the PTI government stays, otherwise will go home. I am not a renegade,” he said.
He expressed the hope that 5pc economic growth rate was expected despite various headwinds this year, as some sectors were also showing robust growth including large-scale manufacturing, agriculture and exports. “This shows there is thrust in the economy and momentum is returning,” he said, adding that this did not mean there were no headwinds but policy adjustments would continue to absorb them.
“The welcome news is that the LSM has grown by 8.2pc in January against same month of last year and 4.2pc against December 2021,” he said, adding the LSM growth had slowed down in August and September 2021 but the trend had reversed. “Our economic growth momentum has picked up again as all agriculture crops are growing at 6 to 12 percent, and exports and services sectors are also growing at a high pace,” the minister pointed out.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,NA speaker summons no-trust session on 25th,"Government to file reference in SC today to end politics of ""sale and purchase"".","ISLAMABAD: In an apparent move to prolong the voting on a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan, National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser on Sunday summoned the session of the lower house of parliament on March 25, violating the Constitution under which he is bound to convene a session within 14 days after the submission of a requisition. 
Meanwhile, the government also took a significant decision under which it will file a reference in the Supreme Court on Monday (today), seeking “an opinion” of the apex court on two main points — whether the disqualification of a legislator is for life time and whether the dissident MNAs of any party can cast vote on a no-confidence resolution. 
The speaker, who under the Constitution was bound to call the NA session by March 21 [within 14 days after the opposition’s requisition], gave an excuse that since the three-day conference of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) would be held in the NA hall, there was no other place in the federal capital to convene the NA session. 
This is despite the fact that the capital offers alternative locations where such an event can be held such as the spacious Jinnah Convention Centre, Prime Minister Secretariat, Pak-China Centre, two five-star hotels, etc. 

Government to file reference in SC today to end politics of ‘sale and purchase’

The opposition lashed out at the speaker for his decision to hold the NA session on March 25, saying he had violated the Constitution to prolong the voting on no-trust motion. 
Sources in the government told Dawn that the decisions to hold the NA session on March 25 and filing of the reference in the Supreme Court were taken at a meeting presided over by Prime Minister Khan at his Banigala residence on Sunday. 
Speaker Asad Qaiser issued an order saying the [opposition’s] requisition was received on March 8 for summoning the National Assembly. Whereas, on Jan 21, 2022, a motion had been adopted by the NA to allow the exclusive use of NA chamber for the 48th session of the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers scheduled for March 22, 23 or any other date. 
He said the renovation work on the NA chamber and its lobbies had commenced on the requirement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the end of February 2022, which was under taken by the Capital Development Authority. 
The speaker said that after the receipt of [the opposition’s] requisition, the NA Secretariat requested the Senate Secretariat to provide chamber of the Senate for holding the NA session, but the latter pointed out that the Senate chamber was also not available for being under renovation. 
“Thereafter, the CDA chairman and deputy commissioner, Islamabad, were also approached to arrange and provide a suitable building for holding the session of the National Assembly outside the parliament building, at Islamabad. However, they have informed in writing that no suitable place is available at present in Islamabad for holding the NA session,” Mr Qaisar added. 
“In view of the aforementioned facts and circumstances, it is evident that no suitable place would be available for holding the session of the NA till March 24. Having no adequate option available whatsoever, for holding of the NA session before March 24, therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under clause (3) of Article 54 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, read with Article 254 of the Constitution, I hereby summon the session of the National Assembly on the first available date i.e. Friday, March 25 at 11.00am at the Parliament House, Islamabad,” the order said. 
Meanwhile, Planning and Development Minister Asad Umar said in a tweet that the government would file a reference in the Supreme Court that would end the politics of “sell and purchase” and diminish the influence of “easy money” and “influence in politics”. 



 
When contacted, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said the decision to file the reference was taken by the prime minister in a meeting on Sunday. “The basic reasons of filing the reference are — to know whether the disqualification of any legislators is for lifetime and that can PTI dissidents cast vote on the no-trust motion,” he added. 
A source said the NA speaker could call the session on March 21 to meet the constitutional requirement [within 14 days after the requisition] and adjourn the session for three days for the OIC conference and it could resume on March 24. 
According to Article 63 of the Constitution, the prime minister is given three days after the tabling of a no-trust motion, for preparation. However, the government is apparently trying to linger on the voting on the motion — first by an excuse of “lack of suitable place for the session till March 25” and then filing of the reference in the Supreme Court. 
The information minister said the government was only seeking an opinion of the apex court and it could be given by the court even on the first day of filing of the reference or the court could take more time it deemed appropriate. 
Asked why the NA session was not called on March 21, he said the NA hall was not available for the session due to the OIC summit.

2022-03-20,2022-03-21,Opposition calls for Asad Qaiser’s trial under Article 6,"PTI accused of running social media campaign against army; PML-Q wants PM to take notice of ""anti-Pakistan"" drive.","ISLAMABAD / LAHORE: Opposition parties on Sunday slammed National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser for not convening the assembly session within 14 days of its requisition to take up their no-confidence resolution against Prime Minister Imran Khan, demanding that he should be tried under Article 6 of the Constitution.
The opposition parties also lashed out at the PM for, what they called, using the religion card in an effort to save his government and accused his party of launching a ‘propaganda campaign’ through its social media team against the army over its ‘neutrality’.
Speaking at a news conference, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari expressed the hope that the Supreme Court would take notice of the violation of the Constitution by the speaker, proving that there was at least one institution in the country for the protection of the Constitution, democracy and right of the vote of the parliamentarians. 
Stating that the job of the SC was to protect and implement the Constitution, the PPP chairman hoped that the court “will not facilitate this government on its unconstitutional step” and that it would make a constitutional decision, not a political one. 

PTI accused of running social media campaign against army; PML-Q wants PM to take notice of ‘anti-Pakistan’ drive

“We appreciate how the SC sent a message of standing with the law and Constitution, even on a weekend,” he said in an apparent reference to the hearing of a petition of the Supreme Court Bar Association during which the court had reprimanded the government over the attack by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) activists on Sindh House. 
He said the SC was already hearing a petition that had not been filed by them, but the bar association. However, he said the court had issued notices to the political parties as well in the case and they would present their viewpoint before it. 
“This coward captain [the PM] is running away from the vote of no confidence. He is escaping to the extent that he has made the speaker abrogate the Constitution,” the PPP chairman observed. 
Mr Bhutto-Zardari lashed out at PM Khan for using Islam for party politics and asked him not to use the slogan of Madinah state. 
“You (the PM) are the foreign-sponsored and foreign-funded agent who has been planted in our system,” he said while criticising the government’s foreign policy. He alleged that the prime minister had been given the task to damage the country’s foreign policy and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and that he had done it “beautifully”. 
He accused Mr Khan of adopting the foreign policy of India, stating that there was no difference in the foreign policies of the two countries. 
Addressing a separate news conference, PML-N’s senior vice-president Shahid Khaqan Abbasi also accused the speaker and the premier of violating the Constitution and committing treason under Article 6 which, he said, was not a joke. He said if anyone would interfere in the democratic process of no-trust move, he would commit ‘treason’. 
PML-N secretary general Ahsan Iqbal alleged that Mr Khan was using religion card to cover up his “dirty politics and incompetence”. 
Earlier, in a statement, PML-N information secretary Marriyum Aurangzeb stated if the speaker failed to convene the NA session before March 22, he would be guilty of violating the Constitution that was be punishable under Article 6. 
Campaign against institutions
During the news conference, the PPP chairman also alleged that the PM and his social media team had launched a ‘propaganda campaign’ to ‘provoke’ an institution so that it could not remain ‘neutral’. 
“When a time has come when the media is talking about a neutral environment, Imran and his social media team are trying to spread the propaganda that institutions are not neutral, be it through provocation or creating a constitutional crisis,” he said.
“It is the responsibility of all of us to demand and try for every institution to work within its domain drawn by the law and Constitution, and to criticise when this does not happen. However, it is also our responsibility to oppose the prime minister, his social media team and its members who are provoking and targeting an institution under a conspiracy,” he added.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari said the prime minister had equated the term ‘neutral’ with animals and had still not apologised to the nation over it. “Our efforts have always been for neutrality. The PM, his social media team and ministers are making desperate attempts to tarnish neutrality. We condemn this,” he said without elaborating.
The PPP chairman, who had not named the institution during his press conference, later asked the Inter-Service Public Relations and the judiciary to take notice of the propaganda campaign by the PM, his social media team and the MNAs aimed at getting “the status of neutrality” changed.
Though Mr Bhutto-Zardari did not give any reference to the army when he talked about the allegation regarding the propaganda campaign against neutrality, the PML-Q and the PML-N came out more openly when they castigated the PTI government for hitting out at army and Inter-Service Intelligence by a party’s woman MNA and an important member of the PTI’s media team. 
A video clip with the audio of PTI MNA Kanwal Shauzeb shared from a twitter space “Current political situation” went viral on social media in which she could be heard apparently talking about military establishment. “They have nothing to do with performance and neither they want to manage the country. They had never done it in the past, then why will they do it now. Actually, they wanted to hijack the system and working on an agenda of minus-Imran Khan,” she said in the clip, adding that the real issue was that the premier was not allowing those sitting in “different institutions and all kinds of institutions to continue their loot and plunder” and “that’s why they are now having panic attacks”.
Since Saturday afternoon, an unusual debate has started on Twitter with a host of people, apparently the PTI supporters, trying to make the army leadership controversial by levelling all kinds of accusations. They were found accusing the army chief of trying to undermine the government and the present system. 
In response, several people also came out in support of the armed forces, blaming the present government of maligning the armed forces and its chief.
Reacting over the clip, PML-Q MNA Chaudhry Salik Hussain tweeted: “The PTI’s social media team and a woman MNA levelled false allegations on the Pakistan Army and the ISI, which are unacceptable and unbearable.” 
Mr Hussain demanded that the PM must take notice of this “dirty anti-Pakistan campaign, otherwise, the PML-Q knew well how to deal with the anti-Pakistan elements”.



 
Also, the official spokesman for PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif, Malik Ahmad Khan, tweeted that the PTI social media team would not be allowed to defame the Pakistan Army. “The state’s existence gets threatened when a state army’s central authority is compromised,” he said. 



 
“When a state will not respect the status of the institution of army, can a state survive?” he asked in a linked tweet. “The strong army is a guarantor of strong Pakistan,” the spokesman said, adding that every Pakistani was ready to sacrifice his life for country’s solidarity and progress.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Jahangir Tareen group sees their demands being met,A senior party leader in Punjab says the PM has agreed to remove CM Buzdar but wants the dissident group to wait for a while.,"LAHORE: Members of the dissident Jahangir Tareen group in the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) appear confident they will have their way after securing guarantees that the chief minister of Punjab will be removed from office.
Sources in the group told Dawn that Prime Minister Imran Khan had all but “agreed” to accept the demands of the dissident group, but has sought more time to remove Chief Minister Usman Buzdar in order to “avert the impression of being blackmailed”.
Shaken by a no-confidence motion against the premier, the PTI government is on a mission to mend ways with party dissidents. A senior delegation of government members met the Jahangir Tareen group and asked them to explain their concerns and demands in detail.
“The Tareen group remains adamant over the removal of Usman Buzdar and explained their concerns with regards to victimisation, lukewarm response from Chief Minister Office to their problems and the bureaucracy’s attitude towards their group members,” a source in the Tareen group told Dawn.
A senior party leader in Punjab told Dawn the prime minister had agreed to remove CM Buzdar but wanted the dissident group to wait for a while, because an immediate acceptance of the demand would be exploited by the opposition as if “Imran Khan has bowed down to dissidents’ blackmail”.
The PTI government had also conveyed that the new chief minister would be from PTI parliamentarians, the senior party leader said, adding that the Tareen group assured the government team that it did not want to leave the party until it would be compelled to do so.
Problems being resolved
Meanwhile, key Tareen group member Lala Tahir Randhawa said a government team led by cabinet minister Murad Raas had called on the group and agreed to resolve problems that could be addressed through the administration.
Since the government team had been given two days to resolve the parliamentarians’ issue, Mr Randhawa said a response had started to come, as deputy commissioners, district police officers and other government officials were calling all group members to address their problems.
He said that actions taken to victimise him and provincial minister Ajmal Cheema were also being undone. “The government team will return with its problems’ resolution report and the group will meet on Wednesday to take a final decision,” he added.
Mr Randhawa asserted that the group’s main demand was “minus-Buzdar” because the incumbent chief minister had ruined the governance system in the country. “Another large group of MPAs have also contacted the Tareen group and expressed support for its demand of removing Buzdar from Punjab’s chief ministership,” Mr Randhawa revealed.
Answering a question about PTI dissident and former senior minister Abdul Aleem Khan’s conduct with the group after visiting it at Jahangir Tareen’s residence, Mr Randhawa said Aleem Khan did come and a five-member committee was constituted — including Mr Randhawa, Nauman Langrial, Abdul Hayee Dasti and Ajmal Cheema — to coordinate with Aleem Khan. However, Aleem Khan did not call the committee and he alone met Sindh Governor Imran Ismail, who visited him on the instructions of the prime minister.
Sources said the government had conveyed to the Tareen group that CM Buzdar would be replaced by another senior leader within the party and four names have started doing the rounds in the PTI parliamentarians’ circle, including those of provincial minister Raja Yasir Humayun, Murad Raas, Mian Aslam Iqbal and Asif Nakai.
Tareen group members told Dawn that 13 of their 17 MPAs were elected as independents and later joined the party. “Even if the Tareen group decided to vote against PM Imran Khan in the centre and CM Buzdar in Punjab, the government would not be able to de-seat them because they were not elected on PTI tickets,” Mr Randhawa told Dawn.
Tareen ‘held party together’
Meanwhile, Jahangir Tareen’s spokesman Awn Chaudhry said some eight MNAs were standing with the group and take a decision about supporting or not supporting the government in the opposition’s no-confidence motion.
“I was personally disturbed when I saw that several MNAs stood against the party,” he said and added that it all happened because PM Khan pushed away Jahangir Tareen, who was actually keeping all MNAs intact with the party.
“Mr Tareen used to help the prime minister in difficult times and resolve party parliamentarians’ problems,” he said and asked whether the PTI should not hold the premier’s political aides accountable for all this mess.
Answering a question whether Jahangir Tareen could enter into any deal with the PML-N, he said he could not comment on his leader’s behalf. “Whatever Jahangir Tareen will decide, his whole group will go along his decision,” he asserted.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,RED ZONE FILES: All set for a collision course,Some govt officials have started to acknowledge in private that prospects of surviving this challenge from opposition are slim.,"Political entanglements may once again be headed to the courts. 
Speaker Asad Qaiser has summoned the crucial session of the National Assembly on Friday, March 25, which is three days longer than the Constitution has stipulated once the required number of parliamentarians have requisitioned a session. This order further complicates a situation that is fraught with danger and uncertainty. Here’s where things stand today and what they could portend in the coming days:

The PTI government is doing legal gymnastics with constitutional procedures, but there is no way around the vote of no-confidence against Prime Minister Imran Khan. The only way that the PM can retain his job is if the opposition fails to muster a strength of 172 in the lower house during the vote. Or if for some reason, the opposition withdraws the motion. There is no other way out for the PM and his cabinet. Legal experts say the speaker may attempt to delay the process and push the vote forward, and this may ultimately end up in courts, but the vote will need to take place one way or another. What matters is the numbers game. Everything else is a side show.
The courts may in fact become the battleground before the real battle on the floor of the National Assembly. If both the government and the opposition head to the Supreme Court with their petitions, the court may need to pronounce on the following: (i) if Article 63 of the constitution allows the party head to stop errant members of his party from voting on the confidence motion (ii) if the disqualification under Article 3 for members indulging in floor crossing can be a lifetime ban (iii) if the speaker can delay summoning of the National Assembly for more than the two-week limit spelt out in the Constitution and whether he can somehow delay the moving of the motion for the vote of no confidence. 
These issues will be addressed by the Supreme Court this week and a lot will depend on how long the SC takes to pronounce a decision. According to legal experts, if the SC reaffirms the obvious interpretation of the constitutional procedure for the vote of no-confidence, then the government will have no other option but to fight the numbers game, which it appears to be losing at this stage.
The planned rallies by the government and the opposition on Sunday, March 27, have added an explosive element to the volatile situation. Inside the Red Zone, there is a genuine fear that if these rallies are allowed to take place as scheduled, then there is a danger of violence breaking out. Now, imagine the real danger: when such violence ensues between a sitting government and its opponents, what does the police do? And if the police cannot handle such a scenario, the only option is what Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid has been referring to in his speeches: handing over security responsibility to the armed forces.
There is no need for the situation to deteriorate to such a level. But it is being dragged towards such an outcome by the government itself. What is otherwise a straightforward constitutional procedure is being weaponised by the use of mobs and threats. These in turn are being used to fuel a new narrative that focuses on accusations of horse-trading as a means to undermine a democratic process. What is being deliberately ignored is that such allegations need to be proved in a court of law for any action to be taken. They are handy for political sloganeering but cannot be used to counter what is purely a constitutional and legal process.
The government allies have stitched up their agreements with the opposition but according to Red Zone insiders, they will hold back formal announcements till after the OIC foreign ministers’ meeting. Despite the ups and downs of this week and the increase in political temperatures, the PML-Q, MQM and BAP are still locked into an understanding whose final details are being stitched up. One parliamentarian from the allied parties said their decision was intact as per the understanding reached.
One key challenge for the opposition is to keep its members safe, secure and available in Islamabad. This has led to daily congregations for dinners where the leaders keep an eye on their flock while also ensuring that none are under any pressure or facing threats. Opposition insiders say this is harder than it sounds as these elected members have a strong gravitational pull from their constituencies and yet cannot be allowed to disperse from Islamabad at a crucial time when every single vote counts.
While it is clear that the vote of no confidence will take place in a matter of days, there remain some uncertainties that are becoming a source of concern: (i) if PM Khan is on a collision course – as is evident from his speeches, including the one on Sunday – is there a way the system can be saved from instability without the opposition ceding space to him? (ii) Will the establishment be forced to intervene if matters start to spin out of control (iii) what will happen if the PM decides to use the ‘nuclear option’ of firing a senior official and appointing a new one in his place?
Some senior government officials have started to acknowledge in private that their prospects of surviving this challenge from the opposition are slim. They are now also admitting that the root cause of the dire situation they find themselves in today is the unnecessary and avoidable confrontation with the establishment. 
Yet they are now locked into a predicament that can only reinforce itself if the PTI government falls. The narrative being stitched together by the party leadership will likely further accentuate the source of the conflict and could trigger greater political instability.

The Red Zone is under stress. The coming ten days will determine if it can sustain it.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Cases of femicide rising sharply in Iraqi Kurdistan,11 women were killed in the first two months of this year...,"SULAIMANIYAH: A woman burned alive by her husband, others shot dead by a father or a teenage brother — bloody violence against women has spiked in northern Iraq’s Kurdish region.
The autonomous area, keen on projecting an image of a relative haven of stability and tolerance in war-battered Iraq, has seen a sharp rise in femicide, killings motivated by gender.
“In the past two months, there has been an increase in femicide compared to the previous year,” said Hiwa Karim Jwamir of the Kurdish General Directorate for Combating Violence Against Women.
In the first two months of 2022, 11 women were killed in autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan, most of them shot, said the official based in Sulaimaniyah.
Forty-five women were killed in 2021, up from 25 the previous year, said Jwamir.

11 women were killed in the first two months of this year

On a Friday before dawn, a 15-year-old teenager was fatally wounded by six bullets fired by her father in the village of Soran. The man told police his daughter “went out with two boys late at night”, according to a domestic violence unit which also records so-called “honour killings”.
Across Iraq, gender-based violence rose 125 per cent to over 22,000 cases between 2020 and 2021, says the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund, which has also pointed to “a worrisome increase in depression and suicide among women and girls”. Last December, a 16-year-old girl was disfigured with acid in Baghdad by an adult who wanted to marry her but had been rejected.
For years, activists have denounced violence against women and forced marriages in Iraq, which remains a conservative and patriarchal society.
“Cases of violence against women are on the rise,” said long-time Kurdistan activist Bahar Munzir, director of local group the People’s Development Organisation.
“Most of the women who are killed are victims of a family member.”
A few days before International Women’s Day on March 8, the body of a 20-year-old woman was found on the side of the road in Arbil, the capital of Kurdistan.
Maria Sami, the victim, was known on social networks for her feminist speeches.
The following day, on March 9, Kirkuk police announced the arrest of the killer, her 18-year-old brother.
While he was still on the run, he spoke by phone to a Kurdish television channel and tried to justify the killing by charging his sister had failed to obey the family. In February, mother-of-two Shinyar Huner Rafiq died in hospital, five days after being admitted with serious burns.
“Her husband had come home one evening in a state of intoxication,” Shinyar’s father, Huner Rafiq, told AFP.
“He doused her body in gasoline and set it on fire.” After the father reported the killing, police arrested the husband. “Before dying, Shinyar told us the facts,” said the bereaved father. “We recorded it, and we submitted the video to the investigators.”
Kurdistan’s prime minister Masrour Barzani denounced the “horrific case”, saying he was “deeply troubled” by the spate of violent attacks against women.
The government must impose “the heaviest possible penalty on perpetrators”, he said in a statement.
“There is no honour in honour killings. I’m determined to protect every woman, girl and child from abuse ... This scourge must end.”
In early February, Dohuk police said they had found the corpse of Doski Azad, a 23-year-old transgender woman who had been ostracised by family members.
An arrest warrant was issued to find the suspected murderer: the victim’s brother, who had in recent years been living in Europe.
He had called his family to inform them of his crime and of where the body was, according to police.
The murder was condemned by the UN mission in Iraq, and the consulates of Western countries in Arbil.
The news provoked a torrent of hatred online — against the victim, even though some voices defended minorities’ rights.
In June 2011, Kurdistan passed a law criminalising domestic violence and female genital mutilation.
The law, which threatens life in prison for “honour” crimes, was hailed by non-governmental groups as a major step forward. But the law’s enforcement is hampered by a climate of impunity and a common fear of speaking out.
“When a woman is killed, the procedures of the security services are not the same as when it’s a man, the trial is not the same,” said Munzir, the activist.
“Some cases don’t even make it to court. They are subject to tribal resolution between the man’s family and that of his wife, the victim.“

2022-01-12,2022-03-21,Committee set up to identify officers involved in leasing out Monal Restaurant,"Body asked to assess the transparency of bidding process, comparison of rent rates offered by the lease.","ISLAMABAD: A four-member committee has been formed by the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to identify officers who were involved in processing and leasing out Monal Restaurant and other buildings in the protected area of Margalla Hills National Park (MHNP). 
This has been done in compliance with the orders of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Jan 12, 2022. According to a notification issued by the CDA’s Confidential Wing, the committee is supposed to complete its task within 15 days “so that disciplinary proceedings could be initiated against the delinquent officers/officials”.
Sources in the wing said Deputy Director General Land and Estate Afnan Alam would head the committee while Deputy Financial Adviser Khawaja Aizad Hussain, Director Laboratory Khalid Nawaz and Director Regional Planning Fraz Malik will be its members.

Body asked to assess transparency of bidding process, comparison of rent rates offered by the lease and accepted by the then CDA administration

The notification of the committee, which was issued on March 10, and is available with Dawn, tasked the committee to “identify officer involved in processing/leasing of land/structure of Monal Restaurant in the protected area of National Park in violation of the Act of 1997, Ordinance of 1960, Ordinance of 1966, Ordinance of 1979 and the regulations made under the respective statutes”.
According to the terms of reference (TORs), the committee has been given the task to identify factors behind construction of Monal Restaurant and other buildings in the protected area as it was in violation of various acts and ordinances.
The committee has been directed to “assess the transparency of bidding process for leasing of Monal to a private entity and comparison of rent rates offered by the lease and accepted by the then CDA administration with the then market prices for facilities of similar size and nature, identify/mention relevant provision of laws and regulations, infringed while allowing construction/lease of the Monal Resturant and to ascertain the loss/ damages to wildlife, flora and fauna and environmental changes in National Park due to said construction of the restaurant”.
While hearing a petition related to Monal Restaurant, the IHC in January this year had ordered the CDA and Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) to seal the building and start proceedings against other buildings that were operating in the national park in violation of rules.
Following the said orders, the CDA and ICT administration sealed the restaurant.
However, the Supreme Court on March 9, suspended the Jan 11 IHC judgement of sealing and taking over possession of the restaurant.
“The unsigned order of the IHC will remain suspended,” ordered a three-judge Supreme Court bench headed by Justice Ijazul Ahsan. Consequently, Monal Restaurant was de-sealed.
The court, which had taken up the appeal of Monal Group of Companies, pointed out why no action was taken against the other 13 restaurants situated in close proximity of Monal and why Monal was discriminated against only and on what basis, its possession was taken over without the certified copy of the high court.
The IHC had ordered the CDA and IWMB to take over forthwith the possession of the restaurant and seal its premises, subject to allowing its owner/management to take out their property. 
The CDA, after construction of the restaurant, had leased it out to a private firm for 15 years and the lease agreement expired last year. 
However, a few years before the expiry of agreement, the lessee started paying rent to the military, which stated that the land where Monal was constructed belonged to them in accordance with a notification issued in 1912.
IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah rejected the military ownership’s claim over the land and ordered recovery of all the rent paid by the Monal Restaurant management. 
The court had also asked the defence ministry to ensure that the amount received as rent was deposited in the exchequer.
“The claim of Remount, Veterinary and Farms Directorate of Pakistan Army, regarding 8,068 acres of land in the notified national park area is in 
violation of the Ordinance of 1979, read with the Ordinance of 1960, and the [Islamabad] Master Plan,” the IHC had declared.
The IHC chief justice had also directed civic agencies to seal the sprawling naval golf course located in the national park area and unless an environmentally-friendly use can be found for it, ordered its demolition within four weeks.
A senior CDA officer confirmed that the inquiry committee had been formed and added that the committee was yet to hold its first meeting.

The statement of traffic police stated that SSP Rai Mazhar proposed to the Capital Development Authority to make the highway signal free.
The project has saved Rs7.5 billion as instead of constructing overhead bridges, the corridor was made signal free by constructing protected U-turns. 
The data of the police showed that over 115,000 vehicles enter and leave from Islamabad Chowk to Zero Point. As they will travel on the signal-free corridor, it will save around 100,000 man hours of people.
On an average four people travel in a vehicle so if each vehicle saves 15 minutes the entire saving of time of four persons will be one hour, the statement said.
Chief Commissioner Islamabad Amer Ali Ahmed had appreciated the proposal of SSP traffic and directed immediate implementation of the proposal. 
Now the Srinagar Highway has been made signal free by constructing three protective U-turns that connected Islamabad and Rawalpindi with the new airport.
All foreign guests and dignitaries use this road while travelling to and from the airport.
The duration of the travel to Islamabad airport would reduce to half.
This will help solve traffic jam by 60 to 70pc while travelling time to Islamabad airport will also reduce considerably, the SSP (Traffic) said.

According to data, only 133 cases were reported in the city during the last one week, with the positivity ratio remaining at 1pc. 
On the other hand, Rawalpindi reported five positive cases on Sunday.
In another development, the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) launched a report on Sunday that covered Pakistan’s Covid-19 response during January-February 2022.

Fafen’s findings stress the need for continued vigilance

During the last few weeks, the fifth wave of the pandemic has been losing severity in the country, which can be gauged from the fact that the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) has decided to lift all restrictions for fully-vaccinated people.
Talking to Dawn, District Health Officer Islamabad Dr Zaeem Zia said though the city had surpassed the figure of 90pc, in terms of complete vaccination, it should be considered around 95pc as a number of residents of the city were outside the country.
“The reduced mortality rate shows credibility of vaccination in the city. Despite the fact that Islamabad has a large number of medical tourism, the mortality rate is almost zero,” he added.
While sharing the weekly data, Dr Zia said in the last week of January, the city observed the highest positivity rate of 16.45pc which then gradually started to decline, reaching 1pc during the last week.
The data showed that on Sunday, the capital reported 21 Covid-19 patients and the infection rate of 1.32pc.
Meanwhile,five people tested positive in Rawalpindi district and four recovered during the last 24 hours.
According to the health authority’s data, the positivity ratio in the district was 0.56pc. A total of 892 samples were collected out of which results of 887 people came back negative.
There are 76 active patients in Rawalpindi district as of March 20, with three patients admitted to hospitals and 73 home isolated.
Two patients surfaced from the cantonment areas and one patient each from Kallar Syedan, Taxila and Islamabad. There is no patient on ventilator, however one is on oxygen and the other two are stable.
On the other hand, a report of the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) has observed varying healthcare capacities across regions and districts during the fifth wave of Covid-19 that remained a major challenge and key concern.
With the onset of Omicron variant in December last year, confirmed cases jumped to 133,839 in January – the highest since the start of the pandemic – while the number of recoveries was recorded at 38,366.
Compared to January, cases started to decline in February. The health authorities recorded 79,855 confirmed cases and 147,548 recoveries in the month.
Fafen’s findings of the third pandemic governance monitoring report, released on Sunday, reinforced the need for consistent and continued vigilance and the necessity of both medium and long-term structural and policy changes built on the lessons learnt.
Compared to the earlier waves, the report highlighted a broad two-pronged pandemic response to the fifth surge of Covid-19 that helped Pakistan withstand and manage the challenges relatively well.
The first aspect of the response comprised varying levels of restrictions and targeted measures in areas with high positivity ratio.
The second wave comprised a parallel push for increased vaccination and broadening the eligible population section to include the 12-16 age group. A remarkable increase of 30 million to the fully vaccinated column during the first two months of the ongoing year is a testament to the seriousness accorded to the effort, the report said. 
Despite a slow start, Pakistan’s vaccination drive gained significant momentum, reaching an average of one million doses per day by the end of last year.
Pakistan had administered 216.9 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine by the first week of March 2022. Approximately 100 million people were fully vaccinated (65pc of the vaccine eligible population and 44pc of the total estimated population), whereas around 127.5 million are ‘partially vaccinated’ as per the information provided by the NCOC website and their official twitter account.
As assessed in the report, had the Omicron variant been as severe as the earlier variants, it would have seriously tested the healthcare system — a factor that shall not be lost on policymakers responsible for responding to any new variant of Covid-19 or a completely new pandemic.
For instance, the availability of beds, ventilators and doctors within the observed districts showed that the healthcare system in Pakistan was still under-equipped — more so in some areas than others.
If the situation had necessitated the hospitalisation of those infected, the number of patients per ventilator and patients per bed would have resulted in severe consequences for some of the districts.
For instance, Karak district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa would have 21,132 and 1,023 patients per ventilator and bed respectively, followed by Mardan with 669 patients per ventilator and 324 patients per bed, and Rawalpindi with 204 patients per ventilator and four patients per bed.
The private sector has played a significant role in providing services and facilities that have contributed to the overall pandemic governance and response. However, there remains the need for more effective regulation, especially regarding the pricing of critical services.
However, what remains a key concern for the government is the issue of price regulation.
Attendants of patients interviewed at various health facilities highlighted the significant variance in test pricing. The respondents claimed to have paid prices ranging between Rs1,000 and Rs15,000 or more.

Talking to Dawn, the minister said a fully funded Annual Development Programme (ADP) of Rs1.4 billion was approved for the construction of the university campus. He said the project was the joint ownership of the city as locals contributed funds towards raising different buildings.
The foundation of UoC was laid by Prime Minister Imran Khan near Balkasar area two years ago, which is nearing completion, Mr Sarfraz said.
The request for establishment of the city campus was also submitted to the Punjab government so that students of Chakwal city did not travel 16km to Balkasar daily, he said.
The PC-I for the city campus has been approved and Rs1.4 billion allocated for the construction of the campus, the minister said.
“Two academic blocks, an admin block and male and female hostels would be built and renovation carried out with the fund,” the provincial minister said, adding that construction of the city campus would be completed by 2024.
“The Ministry of Higher Education was my favourite portfolio that has played a constructive role in the establishment of a public university in Chakwal. The engineering campus of the university in Balkasar is under construction and is expected to finish by the next year,” Mr Sarfraz said.
“Campuses of the university would be spread in different areas of Chakwal including Chakwal city, Balkasar and Murid. Land is being acquired in Murid area of Chakwal for construction of several facilities. The vision for this university is to have 30,000-40,000 students and to be an exemplary university of the Rawalpindi Division,” he said, adding that there was no major public university in the division like Lahore, Multan and Faisalabad.
He said: “Many intelligent female students from different areas of Chakwal were deprived of higher education as they were not allowed to get admissions in far-off cities. Now, those students would benefit the most as they can get higher education near their homes. To further create educational facilities for female students who cannot study in co-educational institutions due to conservative backgrounds, female government colleges in Chakwal and Talagang have been affiliated with the UoC and upgraded for BS programmes.”

2022-03-23,2022-03-21,"Another body set up to curb celebratory fire, kite flying","Provincial committee had expressed concern over the menace, suggested strict police action","RAWALPINDI: In the wake of the decision of the Provincial Bird Hazard Control Committee (PBHCC), another body comprising representatives of the district administration, district police, Solid Waste Management Company and Nur Khan Air Base has been formed to effectively eliminate hazards such as celebratory firing, kite flying, pigeon homing and solid waste disposal.
In a letter to City Police Officer (CPO) Omer Saeed Malik, the provincial committee expressed its concern over the menace of celebratory firing and suggested that strict action needed to be taken by the police.
In its recent meeting, the committee discussed preventive measures related to March 23, 2022, when an increased number of aircraft will be flying from different Pakistan Air Force (PAF) bases. Safe flying operations during the fly past are of utmost importance, the members emphasised.

Provincial committee had expressed concern over the menace, suggested strict police action

It was also recommended that the authorities concerned conduct regular surveys and take swift action against all garbage dumps and place a strict ban on wasting food and other similar items, especially within 12 to 15 kilometres around airfields and airports.
Bird control is the responsibility of the airport management since bird shooters are deployed in the area, particularly near runways, and other preventative steps usually need to be taken to avoid any mishap.
“Since celebratory firing has become a real menace to the security of airspace, strict action has to be taken against it,” the committee stated, adding that a survey of marriage halls should be conducted and it should be made sure that there is no celebratory fire in the wake of important events taking place at the venue of the March 23 fly past and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) council of foreign ministers conference.
The CPO Rawalpindi was also asked to take strict action against firing in the air and to submit a report to the office of commissioner Rawalpindi on a fortnightly basis.
The Punjab government had already asked law enforcement agencies to execute Section 144 and devise a strategy to implement a policy on pigeon homing, kite flying, use of laser lights and drones near airbases and airports.
Following the increasing trend of kite flying, the PBHCC had been formed in March 2020 which had held its first meeting under the chair of the chief secretary of Punjab in Lahore.
Besides monitoring celebratory firing, the district police have been taking strict action against kite flyers and have seized a number of kites and arrested many sellers during ongoing crackdown.
When asked about the security level put in place in the city regarding defence day, the CPO said: “The security has been placed at red-alert level, though there has been no specific threat but we are not taking it lightly as doing all possible security measures, including conducting search operations, specifically in border areas.”
All the stake holders had been intimated by the committee to nominate their representatives for the other committee so that effective measures should be taken to prevent celebratory firing.

The PML-N Rawalpindi chapter also warned Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed that its workers would make his entry into Rawalpindi difficult.

“Once the workers decide to ban your entry, you (Sheikh Rashid) will not be able to enter Lal Haveli,” Mr Naseem said.
He said his party had told workers and supporters to get ready for the power show in Islamabad on March 27 and protect the parliamentarians from PTI’s goons.
The meeting decided that women workers would provide protection to the party’s women lawmakers and youth wing to the party’s leadership on March 27.
It also asked the party’s supporters to bring at least 200 people from each union council.
All union council chairmen will lead their separate rallies and join the main rally led by Hanif Abbasi and Sardar Naseem in the city and Malik Abrar and Daniyal Chaudhry in the cantonment areas.
Talking to Dawn, Mayor Sardar Naseem said his party’s workers would welcome the rally led by Maryam Nawaz and Hamza Shehbaz and join them on their way to Islamabad.
“All party workers and supporters will go to Islamabad in the shape of rallies led by former MNA Hanif Abbasi, former MPAs Raja Hanif, Ziaullah Shah and others. Women wing, youth wing, student federation and minority and labour wings will bring their separate rallies,” Mr Naseem said.
He said the PML-N had finalised the plan to counter arrest and if the interior ministry tried to sabotage their peaceful rally, party workers from every street and area of the garrison city would foil its attempt.
“Rawalpindi is the fort of the PML-N which can be seen from the results of the local government elections in the cantonment areas from where not a single PTI member got elected,” he added.
He said in the last three years, the PTI government had done nothing for the residents of Rawalpindi and now Imran Khan had threatened to bring people to Islamabad.
“In Rawalpindi, many PTI local leaders are contacting PML-N as they want to join the party,” he claimed.

2022-03-31,2022-03-21,Over 50pc independent female candidates contesting local govt polls in KP,ISLAMABAD: The independent women contestants outnumbered the combined tally of women candidates fielded by the...,"ISLAMABAD: The independent women contestants outnumbered the combined tally of women candidates fielded by the political parties for the Neighborhood and Village Councils in the second phase of local government elections being held in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) on March 31.
Overall, the independent female candidates constitute 51pc as against 27pc and 22pc women fielded by liberal and religious parties respectively.
This was revealed by Pattan, an NGO that works for democracy, human rights and gender equality in a report released here on Sunday.
It said reserved seats remained vacant or being won without any contest, a phenomenon that had also been seen in the first phase of the polls.
According to Pattan, lack of political will appears to be mainly responsible for low rate of female participation in local elections.
The second phase of local election shows that on an average only 1.76 female candidates are in the field against one seat, while seat to candidate ratio on other categories of seats is much high. For instance, on average there are 10 candidates against one seat for chairmen/mayor category.
Pattan argues that prior conditions (female literacy rate, human development level, women’s participation in labour force and access to public life, etc.,) appear to have played a major role in determining the level of women’s participation in the election.
Because of the existing differentiation, women’s participation as candidates varies from district to district. For instance, in Lower and Upper Kohistan – extremely poor and underdeveloped districts --about 90pc women seats remained vacant. 
In Battagram, out of total 90 female seats as many as 71 or 79pc remained vacant.
In South Waziristan too, more than 68pc of female seats remained vacant, while in Abbottabad, only 32 or 15pc of the 209 seats are vacant. 
In Upper Chitral, female candidates did not leave a single seat vacant.
However, there appears significant variations across districts. 
For instance, share of religious parties is higher than liberal parties in six districts - Mansehra 16pc, North Waziristan 36pc and Kurram 36pc, and Orakzai 32%. The liberal parties have clear edge over religious parties in eight districts - Upper Chitral 33pc, Lower Dir 49pc, Malakand 44pc, Shangla 43pc, Swat 50pc and Upper Dir 57pc. 
In 11 districts the independent candidates constitute clear majority in comparison to combined strength of all parties. 
In Abbottabad 88pc, Battagram 94pc, Upper Chitral 56pc, Lower Chitral 64pc, Mansehra 84pc, North Waziristan 53pc, South Waziristan 81pc, Orakzai 56pc, and Shangla 50pc.
Analysis of the contestation data (ECP Form X List of Contesting Candidates) also reveals some interesting socio-political trends:
1) High participation of female candidates even in the conservative or traditional districts than the combined female candidates of political parties is a clear sign of emergence of new social forces that are ready to play an important role in local governance.
2) Political parties appear to be ignorant of their emergence and have little appetite to broaden and deepen democracy and to avail this opportunity.
3) Political parties seem to be more interested in top positions i.e. mayors and chairpersons than in the quota seats of the marginalised sections of the society.
4) As a large number of women seats will remain vacant even after by-election female populations of many Neighborhood and Village Councils of KPK are likely to be deprived of women representatives.
Pattan’s analysis is primarily based on the ECP’s Form X (list of contesting candidates) of 17 districts.
The Pattan in it’s recommendations said the ECP should make available data and forms of every election promptly.
It said political parties need to invest resources to set up party chapters at grassroots level and must also hold internal party election and ECP should monitor their polling processes.
It also said civil society, women groups and trade unions should plan to field candidates against quota seats.

The event —Implementation research in healthcare quality and safety — was organised by Riphah Institute of Healthcare Improvement & Safety in partnership with World Health Organisation, Imperial College London, City University London, National Institute of Health, Islamabad and Martin Dow Group.
The conference covered topics ranging from infection prevention and control, patient safety in dentistry, role of nursing, implementation of health policies and research, to leadership in healthcare, pharmacovigilance and the role of virtual reality in surgical training.
In his recorded message, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health Dr Faisal Sultan explained why it’s important to focus on patient safety. “This is a serious health issue requiring our immediate attention. Better safety measures improve patient experience, health outcomes, well-being of the healthcare team as well as reduce costs,” he said.

PM’s aide Dr Sultan says 20pc to 40pc of health spending wasted due to poor quality care

Globally, Dr Sultan pointed out, 20 per cent to 40pc of health spending went wasted due to poor quality care and 15pc of hospital costs were on account of harm caused to patients.
“These statistics remind us that patient safety is critical in healthcare. In Pakistan, we need to move towards people-centred care, while paying attention to public health needs and expectations of the community to improve patient safety.”
He appreciated efforts on part of the event organisers and said discussions on the forum would encourage stakeholders to take practical measures in this field.
AI transforming healthcare future
In a session on the future of healthcare, LNH medical director Dr Salman Faridi said artificial intelligence was transforming the future of healthcare as it provided several advantages over traditional clinical decision-making.
On medical error reduction and prevention, he said chances of errors during treatment always existed and like other professionals, doctors should also be forgiven for the error.
In his presentation, Dr Zakiuddin said there was an immediate need to introduce the concept of ‘homspital’ in society where patients were provided healthcare services at home.
“There are several factors in play leading to the emergence of a new hospital structure. These forces include changes in patient population and their needs, advances in clinical knowledge and technology, impact of digital technology, higher patient expectation, difficulties in attracting and retaining an appropriate skilled workforce, financial and funding challenges and growing requirements to measure quality.”
Sharing some data on digital medical / health applications, he said their numbers were increasing rapidly. “Currently, we have 300,000 apps on iOS and Android compared to the approximately 165,000 available in 2015.”
Dr Zakiuddin concluded his presentation by emphasising that doctors and nurses were facing burnouts and to prevent them, the phenomenon of ‘homspital’ should be introduced as soon as possible.
Sindh Health Minister Azra Fazal Pechuho, Prof Paul Barach of Wayne State University, Dr Aziz Sheikh from the University of Edinburgh and Prof Allen Meador from the University of North Carolina, were among the speakers.

Khuhro said at a press conference at Larkana Press Club on Sunday that speaker of National Assembly had acted unconstitutionally by convening session on March 25. 
The opposition had submitted requisition on March 8 after which he was to convene the session within 14 days but if voting on no-confidence motion was not carried out on the date and attempt was made to impose governor’s rule in Sindh, it would prove disastrous, he warned. 
He said the speaker could not prorogue the session without going ahead with no-trust motion the day the session was convened. By holding the session late, the prime minister had attempted to make the speaker a scapegoat, he said. 
He dismissed claims of international conspiracy behind the no-confidence move and said that parliament itself was all powerful to decide about the fate of its prime minister.
Khuhro said that certain PTI members were served with notices for merely not attending the party session and said they could not be disqualified before exercising their vote in favour of opposition’s move. 
He said the government had adopted the strategy to hold public meeting on the day of the no-trust vote to threaten their members with the presence of charged crowd before whom they would have to walk to the assembly and return. It spoke volumes that PTI was short of required numbers, he said.
About possible PPP-MQM alliance, Khuhro argued that PPP had forged alliance with the party in 1988 and 2008 as well and it made no difference if it did it again. However, PPP had reservations over MQM’s stand on integrity of Sindh and demand for new province, he said. 
Reservations over implementation on 40:60 formula in jobs and resources would be sorted out, he said and challenged ruling party to impose governor’s rule in Sindh. It was a mere ‘dream’ after the 18th Amendment, he said. 
He spoke about fissures in the PTI and claimed that currently there were four groups in the party while its allies had taken a clear stand over no-confidence motion. 
He said in a sarcastic tone it was all right when members were brought on planes in 2018 election, but the same were now being branded ‘turncoats’ and traitors’ when they were not ready to stand by Imran Khan.

Malir SSP Irfan Bahadur said that Constable Faisal alias Nadeem lived near Daud Chowrangi and when he reached home after finishing his duty his neighbour Ahmed informed him that his father, Majeed Hameed, had been threatening neighbours with a pistol and asked him to try and talk some sense into his father along with him. 
The SSP said that as soon as the policeman, who was in uniform, unlocked the door Majeed fired at him indiscriminately. He suffered six to seven bullet wounds and was rushed to a hospital in critical condition.
In the meantime, Sharafi Goth SHO Adeel Ahmed along with a police team rushed to the scene after receiving information and tried to arrest Majeed, but he also fired at them causing bullet injuries to the SHO and policeman Yasir.
According to SSP Bahadur, who also reached the scene, police made two attempts to enter the house and finally they entered and evacuated other family members from the house. During an exchange of gunfire Majeed was shot and killed, he added.
He said the deceased was a retired sepoy of the Frontier Constabulary. He was currently employed as a watchman in Defence.
The SSP said his possible criminal and mental health record was being checked. He said police were trying to ascertain whether the pistol was a licensed one or not.
He said the condition of wounded policeman Nad­e­em was critical and he was put on ventilator. The condition of the SHO and other policeman was out of danger, he added.

2018-01-27,2022-03-21,"Depression, stress on the rise among Karachi youth, say researchers","Study conducted by NED University’s AI lab on 3,000 individuals will help treat mental issues, experts say.","KARACHI: A latest scientific study, which is part of a world-level publication, has found that levels of depression, anxiety and stress are growing mainly among the young population of Karachi.
The impact of Covid-19 pandemic has further worsened the psychological situation as in some cases the number of people suffering from such conditions has increased by 40 per cent.
The facts emerged in the data collected through a scientific research being conducted by the NED University of Engineering and Technology that had studied more than 3,000 individuals at its Neurocomputation Lab, which is one of the nine facilities set up under the National Centre of Artificial Intelligence (NCAI).
The study, experts believe, would help devise new modified strategies on diagnosis and treatment of mental health issues.
“We carried out the study on 3,000 individuals,” said Dr Muhammad Abul Hasan, associate professor at the biomedical engineering department of NED University.

Study conducted by NED University’s AI lab on 3,000 individuals will help treat mental issues

He said: “In post-Covid scenario we have found that issues of anxiety and stress have increased between 35pc to 40pc after the pandemic hit the country. This increase of percentage has been found among those who are suffering from mild and moderate psychological issues. 
“The alarming thing is that we have also recorded extreme and severe cases and in this category we have found that 28pc cases of depression have increased followed by 27pc in anxiety and 22pc in stress,” Dr Hasan said.
Despite being an engineering university, the institution was working in fields of neurosciences and neuropsychology, where the teams of researchers were exploring ‘neurological biomarkers’ of mental health, he added.
The part of the study, he said, also required that how all these biomarkers after being identified could be reversed.
Explaining neurological biomarkers, Dr Hasan, who is also the co-principal investigator at the Neuro Computation Lab, said: “Whenever we go through any psychological problem, it changes the brain patterns. There are regions in the brain. These regions have connections among them. After any psychological problem, these connections receive the impact. They may get stronger or in some cases weaker. Sometimes they disappear and sometimes new connections emerge. So basically we study these connections and analyse that they can be reversed.”
The experts believe once the research is compiled and becomes part of a global study, it would be a big achievement of Pakistani researchers, who are leading the exercise with international collaboration of the University of Glasgow, Stanford University, the Monash University Australia and the Denmark Technological University under the NCAI programme.
Vision 2025
The NCAI is the technological initiative of the federal government under its ‘Vision 2025’.
The centre is designed to become a leading hub of innovation, scientific research, knowledge transfer to the local economy, and training in the area of AI and its closely affiliated fields.
The aim of the centre is to facilitate researchers in the field of AI; help them establish and grow AI industry following international trends and seek solutions to the indigenous problems through AI.
Approved in January 2018, the NCAI is designed on a consortium model where the most leading researchers in the field of AI are identified on competitive grounds and new state-of-the-art laboratories are established under their supervision. 
As research on the mental health issues in the wake of post-pandemic scenario enters the final phase, it has raised the hopes of researchers and experts that it would go a long way both for medical science professionals and health scientists.
‘Replace traditional treatment’
“The technology has two roles when it comes to health sciences,” said Dr Saad Ahmed Qazi, dean of faculty of computer engineering at the NED University.
“One is about diagnostic, where it helps you finding timely and accurate health issues and problems. The other is about remedial action. In technology, there are several neuro-modulation techniques, which can be used for effective and durable treatment.”
He said the university’s study would help replace the traditional way of treatment in mental health and it would gradually make things easy both for the medical science professionals and people suffering from such conditions.
“In mental health issues we largely see the counselling as one of the key tools for treatment. So we can say that it [technology] gives you an opportunity to go a step forward from the conventional way of treatment and here we can capitalise on the benefits of the technology which ultimately benefits a common man,” said Dr Qazi.

The fresh determination was demonstrated in a rally in Laasi Goth, Malir on Sunday, where the participants vowed to continue their struggle for ‘Naya Pakistan’ and described the founder of their party as the only hope for a prosperous and corruption-free Pakistan. 
Leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh told the rally that PM Khan emerged as the leader of Ummah as he has raised the issue of Namoos-i-Risalat (PBUH) on all international forums and played a pivotal role in approval and passage of a historic resolution against Islamophobia in the United Nations.
He said he was the leader who had given Pakistan a sovereign and independent foreign policy by saying ‘absolutely not’ on a question of handing over air bases to a foreign power. 
The people of Sindh in a large numbers are ready to depart for the federal capital and caravans of over 1,000 vehicles are being prepared while a train is booked as well, he announced. 
“It is so unfortunate that Sindh House in Islamabad is being used for horse-trading, which creates a negative perception of Sindh across the country and caused embarrassment to the people of the province,” said Mr Sheikh. 
Protest at estranged MNA Kumar’s house 
Meanwhile, PTI workers staged a protest demonstration outside the residence of disgruntled party MNA Ramesh Kumar. 
Carrying placards and party flags, they chanted slogans and warned the MNA about public reaction against his decision to vote against PM Khan in the upcoming no-confidence resolution. 
Led by PTI MPAs Saeed Afridi, Shabbir Qureshi and Shahnawaz Jadoon, the PTI workers said they would welcome Mr Kumar back into the party folds if he reviewed his fresh decision.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Finding and filling health  gaps digitally,"While various startups addresses a spectrum of challenges, till the net is cast wider and deeper, health tech will not be a...","“A man was having severe heart problems in Loralai, Balochistan,” narrates Dr Sara Saeed Khurram, co-founder of Sehat Kahani. “It was during the peak of the pandemic when the country was under lockdown and access to medical advice, tricky at the best of times in remote areas of Pakistan, had become all the more challenging. But he was able to connect to a doctor through Sehat Kahani and got prescribed the required medicine that helped save his life.”
With a ratio of one doctor for every 1,200 patients, half the population of Pakistan does not have access to basic primary healthcare services. Hand-in-hand is the phenomenon of doctor bahus: women who train medically but for a myriad of reasons are unable to practice in a country that desperately needs more doctors.
Born out of Dr Khurram’s personal experience, Sehat Kahani is a health tech social enterprise that provides a solution to both problems. “I was practicing when I had to shift cities. By chance, I connected to the nurse on duty at my old desk who told me patients were still coming to the clinic but no doctor was available. I started consulting on the phone and eventually got a webcam. Over time the chance encounter evolved into Sehat Kahani,” says Dr Khurram.
Operating through a network of 37 clinics, to date Sehat Kahani has offered 850,000 consultations and employs 7,000 doctors of which 85 per cent are females.

While various startups addresses a spectrum of challenges, till the net is cast wider and deeper, health tech will not be a panacea for all healthcare problems in Pakistan

According to the global health security index 2021, Pakistan is ranked 130 out of 195. From being able to access medical advice to the purchase of genuine medicine to recognising the presence of a disease, there are challenges across the entire process. Digitisation has stepped in to address many of the gaps of which Sehat Kahani is a case in point.
“We have saved six people from committing suicide in Pakistan,” says Syed Naseh, CTO of Saaya Health, a mental health platform. Available in seven languages globally and Urdu, Punjabi, Pashto and Sindhi in Pakistan, Saaya Health has conducted over 4,000 counselling sessions and its social-emotional learning content has reached about 100,000 children.
One in four people in Pakistan suffer from mental health issues. In Karachi, where multi-generational families live in small apartments, one in three suffer from depression and anxiety. And yet, there is a taboo around mental health with those seeking it as perceived to be ‘mad’, explains COO Alizeh Valjee who has a background in psychology.
During the pandemic, relationship issues were exacerbated, increasing domestic violence. The rate of disability and dysfunction increased in those with existing mental health issues along with burnout rates. Stress related to financial insecurities, rise in unemployment and poverty, lack of access to social support and recreational outlets, inability to access the health system during the lockdown and overall anxiety due to uncertainty together made an environment highly conducive to debilitating mental health and holistic wellbeing.
But things are improving, says Mr Naseh. Mental health is becoming less of a taboo, more literature is being produced and more universities are offering psychology cases, he said while giving the example of the recently held Karachi Wellness Festival.
However, all access to healthcare becomes meaningless if the medicines bought to address the illnesses are fake. And Pakistan’s problems with counterfeit drugs is endemic, with some research statistics indicating that 40-50pc of medicine sold are fake.
“We are trying to connect the pharma companies directly to the patient to help eliminate fake medicines from the system,” says Furquan Kidwai, founder and CEO of online pharmacy Dawaai.
There are 500-plus pharmaceutical companies in the country that are manufacturing drugs distributed by 1000-plus distributors through 45,000-plus licensed pharmacies, he explains using numbers to explain how fragmented the market is. This has resulted in the creation of many layers between the pharma company and the end consumer that has allowed one of the biggest counterfeit medicine markets in the world to flourish.
Because of the cryogenic nature of the market, there are about 20,000 unique SKUs (stock-taking units) available for about 500-600 medicines — each medicine is sold under 10-15 different names. “Take Paracetamol as an example. It is sold under 30 different names — Panadol, Paramol, Parasol etc,” he says.
An average shop has say about 200 SKUs so patients have to go through the hassle of visiting multiple pharmacies to get their prescription fulfilled. The pandemic pushed Dawaai’s user adoption rate to 5x-6x, leading to a current growth rate of 9x. 
The health tech numbers are impressive. One source says there are 331 health tech startups in Pakistan, another says telehealth companies grew by 900pc during the pandemic. But this picture is skewed. While various health tech addresses a spectrum of challenges, from menstrual health to setting up appointments with doctors, the ease of access is limited to the relatively affluent that have access to the internet and a basic understanding of technology. Till the net is cast wider and deeper, health tech will not be a panacea for all healthcare problems in Pakistan.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Looking towards the small guy,"There are more than 3,000 Pakistani sellers on Alibaba.com with close to 90pc of them coming from Sialkot","

Mr Song Song, Country Manager, Ali Baba

 
For as long as one can remember, Pakistan has been stuck in a perpetual cycle of boom and busts. Ask any minister, finance bro or stock analyst masquerading as an economist the recipe to break free from this and they will tell you increasing exports is the answer. That’s also something Commerce Advisor Abdul Razak Dawood has made a key priority since the first day. 
One such measure his ministry could claim credit for was getting Pakistan placed on the Amazon’s sellers’ list, which we were told would open new avenues for exports for local entrepreneurs. How many of those businesses, mostly used to business-to-business (B2B )contracts, would actually be able to position themselves in the direct-to-consumer (D2C) segment on arguably the most competitive marketplace on the planet was a different matter altogether. 

There are more than 3,000 Pakistani sellers on Alibaba.com with close to 90pc of them coming from Sialkot

Meanwhile, a few thousand businesses from the country had focused their energies eastward towards Alibaba.com. In fact, Pakistan now ranks the highest in terms of paid sellers on the world’s largest B2B e-commerce platform’s Global Business. Since 2017-18, the number of Pakistani sellers on the platform has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent, according to a presentation the company presented to a roundtable at the Board of Investment’s recent conference. 
“There are more than 3,000 Pakistani sellers on Alibaba.com with close to 90pc of them coming from Sialkot,” says Mr Song Song, the company’s country manager for Pakistan. And now he wants to expand the platform’s reach to traders and businesses in other cities, especially the export-oriented ones like Faisalabad and Gujranwala, in addition to Karachi and Lahore. For that purpose, he and his team have been increasing their outreach efforts through awareness sessions at the various chambers of commerce and industries. 
“Apparel is the most popular category among Pakistani sellers, followed by sports goods and surgical equipment given that the majority of our users are from Sialkot,” he shares. According to the ‘Digital B2B Outlook 2022 Pakistan’ published by Alibaba at the beginning of the year, 63pc of the sellers are in the apparel category while a total of 3.2 million listings have been made from the country so far. But how much does that translate into dollar terms? “Unfortunately even we don’t know the gross merchandise value of goods sold from the country on our platform,” Mr Song Song says. 
That’s strange, isn’t it? Maybe at first. As a B2B e-commerce platform facilitating cross-border trade across hundreds of geographies, Alibaba.com is used by many buyers and sellers for discovery and information before actually negotiating the deal between themselves. “Outside China, the US and Malaysia, the transactions still take place offline so it becomes difficult for us to estimate the worth of goods sold,” the executive explains. 
The reason behind that is, of course, the complicated nature of B2B payments which is made even more complex due to the cross-border nature of transactions. “It’s not like B2C where the average order value would be a few dollars. You are talking hundreds of thousands or even a million dollars per order which the current infrastructure doesn’t allow for in Pakistan. And payments are just one component of it; there’s also fulfilment, integration with customs authorities etc. That entire ecosystem needs to be built,” Mr Song Song says.  
In that case, who else to build the ecosystem other than Alibaba.com — the most successful B2B e-commerce platform? “It requires huge amounts of investments as well as time. In China, it took us around five years to develop it,” he says. Before the company embarks on such an ambitious plan, it first wants to create a local presence and create more awareness among the sellers. 
“We are going to set up a local entity for Alibaba.com, the first such for any of the companies of the Alibaba Group [excluding Daraz and Easypaisa as they were acquisitions], and build an on-ground team in Pakistan for functions like customer service, outreach and marketing by the end of the calendar year,” Mr SongSong shares. This is along with growing their channel partners — currently numbering 10 — who currently act as the e-commerce platform’s representatives in the country and help onboard new users and provide support to the existing ones.

2021-07-27,2022-03-21,Hasty growth in housing finance,The euphoric demand for housing finance and a liberal supply of loans remains subject to ground reality checks.,"Agriculture and housing loans — along with micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) finance — are vital for boosting economic activity. And, if banks start lending more to all the three sectors at the same time, that almost guarantees accelerated GDP growth in the short-to-medium term. 
Currently, though, banks are not wholesomely engaged in such an exercise. But the government and the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) are trying to promote just that. Policies introduced for accelerating housing loans offer an added advantage to the government — they make room for politically-motivated tax amnesty in the name of the documentation of the economy. The ongoing Naya Pakistan Housing Programme (NPHP) is no exception.
Regardless of the fact that this is opening yet another avenue under this programme for the whitening of tax-evaded money, housing loans being offered under NPHP are quite promising. Already, they have reactivated the real estate and building construction sector and continue to enliven demand for outputs of dozens of allied industries and services sub-sectors. Their impact on the overall economy (rebased to 2015-16) is already being felt and is sure to become more and more pronounced with the passage of time. That is if future governments let the programme continue in its current form and spirit.

The euphoric demand for housing finance and liberal supply of loans remains subject to ground reality checks after the expiry of the tax amnesty scheme 

Within seven months of this fiscal year (ie between July 2021 and Jan 2022), banks disbursed fresh consumers loans of Rs47.6 billion for the construction of buildings. In addition to this, they also disbursed Rs11.8bn loans to their employees for the same purpose.
Thus, overall lending for construction of buildings in the first seven months of this fiscal year totalled Rs59.4bn, the latest SBP stats reveal. During the same period of the last fiscal year, total lending for housing buildings was too small — Rs7.9bn for general consumers and Rs22bn for bank employees or a total of Rs29.9bn! 
The demand for housing finance remained strong right from the beginning of this fiscal year partly because builders were using tax-evaded money for launching new housing projects following extension in the tax amnesty scheme. Partly, higher economic growth in 2021-21 compared to that of 2019-20 also motivated people to take advantage of the Naya Pakistan Housing Programme made easier this year — and apply for housing loans. 
So, the volumes of housing finance offered so far could have been larger had banks been able to process loans applications a bit more speedily. The PTI government, challenged on all fronts and struggling for its survival, is pushing banks to their limits through the central bank to accelerate the disbursement of housing loans. So, one can hope that the volumes of fresh housing loans would grow even faster in near future, more so because the “no-question asked” status of the investment coming into this sector has been extended — once again — to the end of FY22 in June.

The overall lending for construction of buildings in the first seven months of this fiscal year totalled Rs59.4bn while during the same period last fiscal year, total lending for housing buildings was Rs7.9bn for general consumers and Rs22bn for bank employees or a total of Rs29.9bn

Growth in housing finance and underlying expansion in construction activities continue to fuel growth in allied sectors as well. During July-Dec 2021, manufacturing of iron and steel grew by 18.4 per cent, whereas in the same period of 2020 this sub-sector of large-scale manufacturing had contracted by 12.1pc, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics. 
Monthly cement production which was below 3.7 million tonnes in July 2021 gradually picked up and peaked at 4.48m tonnes in October before coming down to 4.3m tonnes and 4m tonnes in November and December respectively, due to a dramatic rise in the cost of production of coal-fired cement plants after skyrocketing of coal prices in international markets — and not due to slackness in demand. 
To meet the increasing demand for housing finance, and particularly to meet the demand for low-cost housing, the SBP has now eased prudential regulations of microfinance banks. “The changes made in the prudential regulations include additional guidance on property assessment, mortgage creation and risk management,” the central bank announced on March 16. By end of 2021, total lending already made in the housing sector stood at Rs20bn — the number of beneficiaries was 75,000, an SBP press release said.
Moving forward, accelerated disbursement of housing finance through microfinance banks can be expected to boost volumes of financing and enhance the number of loan takers. But whether microfinance loans for housing can actually lead to the construction of new low-cost housing units is doubtful. These loans are likely to end up for purchasing already constructed flats and one-unit residential units or for the renovation of existing houses and apartments. 
The current euphoric demand for housing finance from commercial banks and an equally liberal supply of housing loans remain subject to ground reality checks after the expiry of the tax amnesty scheme in June. If tax amnesty for investment in the housing sector is allowed to expire on time — and not extended any further — construction of new houses and apartments may come to a halt. But that perhaps doesn’t bother the government. 
Another worrisome aspect of the housing finance euphoria is that banks are offering housing loans to their employees, particularly senior executives, a bit too liberally. The central bank needs to watch mortgage finance to bank employees closely to ward off any possible development of banks-builders nexus. Powerful builders particularly those with strong links with politicians and the establishment have successfully circumvented banking and environmental laws in the past for the construction of prized projects both in Karachi and Islamabad. Some of them still continue to do this. 
While making more housing loans, banks must also focus on ensuring their sustainability in terms of market risks and the risk of defaults.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,The challenges of the electronic warehouse receipt system,"If run professionally and efficiently, it may reduce pressure on farmers to sell their produce in panic immediately ...","The resource-constraint smallholder farmers are unattractive candidates for credit from formal financial institutions, which tend to ignore them because of their often unpredictable, fragmented and unstructured agricultural activities.
The State Bank of Pakistan, like the central banks of many other developing countries, is introducing schemes to increase access of small farmers to the formal credit channels, saving them from exploitation by informal money lenders.
The SBP, in this respect, has recently launched the electronic warehouse receipt (EWR) system for maize crop in Kasur district, almost a year after the scheme was introduced for paddy crop in Hafizabad, another central Punjab district. The EWR enables the depositor, whether a producer or dealer, of an agriculture commodity to use it as collateral for obtaining bank loans or trade in commodity markets, if and when the system is linked with the commodities exchange as well.
If run professionally and efficiently, it may also reduce pressure on farmers to sell their produce in panic immediately after harvests when prices are normally low. Thus, it may ensure a better return to farmers for their financial and physical investment and also help stabilise market prices. The system may also reduce post-harvest losses as care of the stored commodity is handed over to certified warehouses equipped with the required facilities and expertise.

If run professionally and efficiently, it may reduce pressure on farmers to sell their produce in panic immediately after harvests when prices are normally low while allowing agriculture commodities to be used as collateral for bank loans

However, the insufficient number of certified warehouses complying with preservation norms, lack of awareness among farmers and their limited business skills, and no incentives for buyers to purchase commodities from the warehouses are identified as the stumbling blocks in the expansion of the system.
Afaq Tiwana, a progressive farmer, says the EWR may be beneficial for the community only if the SBP scheme includes a blueprint for bridging the infrastructure (warehouses and logistics) gap. “There is an acute shortage of certified warehouses and reliable logistic facilities that are required to run the system satisfactorily.” He advocates for incentivising the infrastructure building by assuring business for the owners of the storage units the whole year so that they are attracted to invest more and more in the sector.
For this purpose, he argues, the government needs to get out of the business of wheat, the biggest crop of the country. The government is the major player in the wheat market but does not utilise private warehouses depriving them of around six-month business, he says. A mix of wheat, rice and maize crops, etc will ensure the warehouses do business throughout the year because of their different seasons. Mr Tiwana says for food security the government may buy grain from the warehouses if and when required through bidding.
Ibad Khan, president of Guava Growers Association, endorses the views saying by opting for the private warehousing system the government may save non-development expenditures worth billions of rupees consumed by thousands of Food Department employees in the name of salaries and perks, operating costs of their vehicles and buildings, etc “without doing any good”.
“The (provincial) government may buy four million tonnes of wheat from the certified warehouses through the Pakistan Commodities Exchange and lift the grain when needed from there. It will equal a surplus of thousands of food department employees and thus save huge funds required for the functioning of the department, as well as the hassle of checking theft of the crop from its storages by unscrupulous staff.”
Mr Khan thinks the farm produce warehousing concept may gain currency provided the farming community is given proper awareness and the purpose is well served easily by engaging the Agriculture Department’s field staff. “If a farmer learns that by spending Rs50, for instance, as storage rent, his produce will earn Rs100 then he will automatically turn towards the EWR scheme. The extension wing of the Agriculture Department is in close proximity to the rural population and may help mobilise them for it.”
An attractive package to build high-quality warehouses can find 15 to 20 investors in each village ready to build the storage if provided information/guidance about the business scope and initial technical assistance in running the facilities until these become self-sufficient, he asserts.
While the functioning of the facility will benefit the farming community in many ways, Mr Tiwana says the prevailing farm produce trade system is built to make the rich richer. “At present 70 to 80 per cent of commodities are sold at harvesting time in the country. And thus, these fetch lower rates for the farmers. Large processors and the influential (textile, feed, flour millers, etc) have huge amounts of cash at hand and make these purchases knowing that the prices will shoot up within months. Besides value-addition through their mills, they also earn a big profit through commodities trade, robbing millions of farmers of the money that actually belongs to them.”
The EWR facility will save the poor farmers from panic selling as well as stabilise prices in the open market at harvesting time because an adequate quantity of the produce would have been deposited with the warehouses, freeing the market from surplus crops. This would ensure a better return even for those farmers who will be opting to sell their produce in the spot market, he adds.
Mr Khan stresses that the warehousing concept must be linked to the Commodities Exchange for the sake of the sustainability of the system and that the Exchange should be relocated to Punjab, the largest producer of agricultural products so that those involved in active farming have easy access to it. He laments that no farmer association was engaged by the SBP or any other government entity to seek their input for the scheme.
For Amer Hayat Bhandara, a progressive grower from Pakpattan, the EWR facility seems to be working only for those farmers and final buyers who are qualified customers of commercial banks. He points out that one of the most common problems of the farmer is informal debt: farmers take loans from people in the market with personal guarantees and with a condition that the crop will be sold through them.
Will the middlemen allow the farmer to go for the EWR, he questions? Suppose if farmers want to do so, then the debt of the middleman will be repaid through EWR, but how will the inputs like seeds, fertilisers, fuel and pesticides for the next crop be acquired?

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Business leaders and sleepless nights,It’s time to lie low as there is no chance of any clarity till the no-confidence move is over.,"


 
THE critical domains of the economy and foreign affairs have taken a back seat as the political leadership has been left to scramble for continuing in power. This seems to be rather dicey in a world that is trying to deal with fragile energy markets and food security in its Covid-battered existence, and global peace in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
In addition to tales of human sufferings, the war has disturbed global commodity markets, disrupted supply chains, hiked freight charges and posed challenges to the global financial system after the West slapped harsh sanctions on Russia and excluded it from the SWIFT system of money transfers. Experts and economists have predicted slower growth and an increase in inflation worldwide.   
Instead of strategising to deal with the evolving global challenges, Islamabad appears to be too busy to care. Global experts have included Pakistan amongst the more vulnerable nations where the impact of the fallout of war is expected to be severe owing to the resource-deficient country’s dependence on oil, gas and edible imports.

It’s time to lie low as there is no chance of any clarity till the no-confidence move is over

Just as the masses are doing, businesses are also watching closely the events unfolding at a bewildering pace under the full glare of the media spotlight. With the final outcome not quite certain, the whole saga is keeping business houses unnerved.
The common man is desperately waiting for the debilitating economic stress to ease off to the extent that it possibly can, while the business class is dreading a hostile reaction of the West to the hard stance of the government towards the US and Europe. The handshake images of Prime Minister Imran Khan and President Putin in Moscow on the day Russia launched its attack on Ukraine has already placed the country in an awkward position. 
Some like to project the current situation in Pakistan as the expected manifestation of civil unrest over inflation and job losses, while others link it to be the outcome of deeper structural imbalance. And then there are those who see the struggle rooted in efforts to uphold the supremacy of civilian leadership. 
Argumentative Pakistanis can debate the politics, but they all agree that the economy and its challenges have taken a back seat for now and things will be difficult irrespective of the final outcome of the no-confidence motion in parliament.
The leading lights of business class, when approached for a comment, were evasive. Afraid to land on the wrong side of the current or the future set of rulers, they shared their disappointment with the political class privately, saying it was frustrating to watch the politicians “stoop too low whenever tested”. 
A senior business leader commented” “Prime Minister Imran Khan and his confidants are inciting violence much like Trump did in the US. How can they not understand the consequences? If politicians fail to resist the temptation to take their conflict out of parliament it can make the country drift towards anarchy. Yes, we are worried for our businesses, but we are more concerned about the safety and security of our family and the future of this country.” 
Musadaq Zulqarnain, of Interloop fame, believed that “irrespective of the outcome of the vote in parliament or the movement on the streets, the economy is not in a good shape. It will get worse because of political turbulence which will be followed by popular measures to please the masses without fundamental corrections. 
“Pakistan needs a sustained growth of 7-8 per cent for several years, powered by an increase in exports if it wants to come out of its economic troubles. The only solution is a consensus document — the Charter of Economy — which must be vigorously followed irrespective of the party in power,” he said.
Nasser Hayat Magoon, former president of the Federation of Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), said the troubles had aggravated in the last couple of years. The budget, he thought, has failed to spark much interest among the legislators. In his opinion, it is influenced by “a select group of businessmen that encircles the leadership”. 
Sources in the Ministry of Finance told Dawn that the budget exercise initiated in January has been in progress at the routine pace. 
Pulling out his wish-list, Mr Magnoon said: “The FPCCI suggested simplification of taxation, which was promised but was resisted by the tax bureaucracy. We do not expect a business-friendly budget. The timing of the budget will be contingent on how the present chaotic political situation settles.” 
He said the private sector needs to communicate with political parties and sensitise them to the variety of problems that are being faced by businesses. He warned that street agitation in the current charged environment may have serious consequences. 
Mian Anjum Nisar, another business leader, lamented the lack of clarity in politics, while Majyd Aziz was critical of mismatched priorities of successive governments. 
Regardless of the concerns voiced by the business community, everybody realises that at least in the short term, there is no chance of any clarity till the no-confidence move is over.

2022-07-27,2022-03-21,Auto parts — setting a new record for imports,New entrants are rolling out vehicles with mere 5pc locally made parts which is insufficient to reduce foreign exchange burden.,"Pakistan’s import bill for completely and semi-knocked down (CKD/SKD) kits for cars imported by local assemblers has crossed one billion dollars in just eight months of 2021-22 which is significantly higher than the record high bill of $1.12 billion for the entire of FY21.
The 8MFY22 ended with $1.102bn as compared to $557 million in the same period last fiscal. 
The low levels of localisation by Chinese and Korean investors under Auto Policy 2016-2021 for five years as well as in the new models by existing assemblers have played a key role in boosting the import bill.
As per data of the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the new and old entrants brought CKD/SKD kits worth $4.987bn from 2016-2017 to July-February 2021-2022, thus nullifying claims of achieving higher localisation.
Sources said that the new entrants have started rolling out vehicles from their assembly lines with a mere five per cent locally made parts which is insufficient to reduce the burden on the foreign exchange. 

New entrants are rolling out vehicles with mere five per cent locally made parts which is insufficient to reduce the burden on the foreign exchange rate

Assemblers are now in top gear as the eight months of FY22 ended with a whooping sales jump of 57.5pc in cars to 149,813 units. They are also excited over huge bookings in hands whose delivery time ranges between three months to 11 months. Jeeps and pickups sales have also surged by 51.5pc in 8MFY22 to 28,437 units.
Huge demand for cars has led to a massive jump in CKD/SKD imports to $1.120bn in FY21 from $478mn in FY20, up by 134pc thanks to low-interest rates and attractive auto financing by the banks till the third quarter of 2021
However, curbs on auto financing from the last quarter of 2021, persistent increase in car prices and long delays in delivery appear to have not hurt the buyers’ sentiments in the last eight months, while buyers are also satisfied over the rising resale value of the vehicles owing to months’ long delivery timings, soaring prices and on-money for vehicles for immediate delivery. 
The import bill of CKD/SKD was $660m in FY17 which later swelled to $809m in FY18 and then remained at $818mn in FY19. The fiscal year 2019-2020 was a bad year for the entire country due to the flare-up in Covid-19 from March to June followed by the government’s decision to close down the industrial units in April 2020. As a result, the FY20 import bill of CKD/SKD was just $478m.
Stakeholders had been trumpeting 70pc localisation in Suzuki Mehran which ruled the roads for over 30 years without significant model change. After the end of the iconic Mehran journey in 2018, the claim of achieving higher localisation by stakeholders has now been confined to 55-60pc in various existing Japanese models and 35-45pc in new models. 
It seems that no serious efforts have been made by the existing Japanese assemblers in the old and new models to improve the utilisation levels  of locally made parts in vehicles.
A vendor, who asked not to be named, said the import bill of CKD/SKD would remain under pressure as the new entrants, who had approved their projects under the Auto Policy 2016-2021, would enjoy a honeymoon period for the next four to five years to keep rolling out vehicles with negligible local content. Besides, new models by the existing Japanese assemblers will also take time in improving local content in the vehicles.
He said vendors had asked the government not to allow vehicles’ assembly of higher engine power under tAuto Policy 2016-2021. The new entrants, instead of introducing small cars below 800cc, shifted their focus towards the assembly of high engine power sports utility vehicles (SUV) whose numbers are growing every day.
Chief Operating Officer, Balochistan Wheel Limited (BWL), Muhammad Irfan Ghani in a letter to the CEO Engineering Development Board (EDB) said the EDB is the custodian of the auto vending industry which encourages the localisation of auto parts.
The auto sector in Pakistan is now more than 50 years old but the assemblers have not done localisation seriously, he complained.
He said the pace of localisation of auto parts is too slow due to the discouraging attitudes and lengthy procedures adopted by the assemblers which form a monopoly for their foreign principals. They protect their own interests to use their CKD parts and have made localisation very  difficult. 
Mr Ghani said the country’s precious foreign exchange is being wasted due to non-localisation while many assemblers are not taking parts from the local vendors in some of their newly launched models.
The matter came up for discussion during the first meeting of the Auto Industry Development and Export Committee (AIDEC) held on March 8, 2022, which was attended by the auto stakeholders and officials of the relevant ministries. The AIDEC meeting had decided that the EDB would schedule a joint meeting between Baluchistan Wheels and Pak Suzuki to resolve the matter.
However, AIDEC committee members reiterated that the localisation of parts and components must be pursued in letter and spirit. 
Former Chairman Pakistan Association of Parts and Accessories Manufacturers (Paapam), Abdul Rahman Aizaz attributed the rising import bill of CKD to the massive revival in sales of cars and SUVs from the depressed sales scenario of 2019-2020.
Under Auto Policy 2016-2021, most of the new entrants have focused on manufacturing SUVs, which too has resulted in the higher value of CKD imports. He said that sales volumes of new entrants and old players have shown phenomenal growth due to improving economic indicators.
Since the new entrants under Auto Policy 2016-21 can avail the concession on import of CKD for five years, localisation of parts in such vehicles, especially of SUVs, is in the catching-up phase, he added.
Mr Aizaz said that the unprecedented surge in international prices of various resins and metals, rupee devaluation against the dollar and multiple times higher freight charges have further enhanced the landed cost of almost all raw materials.

2022-02-27,2022-03-21,Surviving tough times,"Regardless of who wins and who loses the no-trust motion, the government will not find it easy to handle the economy.","The rupee hit its lowest ever of over 180 to a dollar in the interbank market on the weekend as the shares market continues to decline. 
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) appears largely satisfied with the PTI government’s explanation of the Rs346 billion relief package announced late last month in an apparent attempt to appease the inflation-stricken households. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) kept the key policy rate unchanged at 9.75 per cent but its warning that it could advance the next Monetary Policy Committee meeting to raise the interest rates if need be has pushed cut-off yields in the last public sector debt auction.
The political instability in the wake of a no-confidence motion submitted by the opposition to oust the prime minister is forcing the government to take populist measures that it might not have if it weren’t facing the existential threat from the opposition political parties that have come together to push Imran Khan out of power in spite of their deep divisions. 

Regardless of who wins and who loses the no-trust motion, the government will not find it easy to handle the economy — many hard decisions will have to be made

No one expected the Kaptaan to go away without fighting till the last ball, but the last week’s events in Islamabad have spawned fears of violence. The storming of the Parliament Lodges, where the opposition lawmakers were housed by police commandos and counter-terrorism force was followed by the attack of the PTI workers on Sindh House in Islamabad. It happened after the opposition gave media access to the place to interview dissident parliamentarians of the ruling party. 
The ruling party’s insistence to gather a million people outside the parliament in the event of the vote on the no-confidence resolution and the threats being tossed around by the ministers has forced the opposition political parties to make their own plans to counter the move. Indeed, everyone expected the prime minister to fight back — but not in this way. 
The situation is fluid and may likely continue for several weeks to come, with its impact expected to reverberate for many months. Regardless of who wins and who loses the no-trust motion, the government will not find it easy to handle the economy. Many tough decisions will have to be made. If the opposition succeeds in de-seating the prime minister, it will have its work cut out for them. 
The first job would be to approach the IMF to release the next tranche to shore up foreign exchange reserves and take the pressure off the home currency. PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has already hinted at renegotiating the deal with the multilateral lender. It is not clear if the Washington-based fund would be more kind to the new government than the Imran Khan administration. 
The second job, the businessmen interviewed by telephone over the weekend say, for whoever — the PTI or the opposition parties — is in power after the vote on the motion would be to mend Pakistan’s relationship with the West, especially the United States. “That does not necessarily mean that we have to dial down our ties with China. Going to Russia when the Kremlin had planned to attack Ukraine was a big foreign policy mistake Imran Khan made. He could have called off the tour and stayed neutral. That would not have brought upon us such pressure from the European Union and the US, with which our relations are already facing problems due to the Taleban takeover of Kabul last summer,” a textile exporter argued. 
“Improvement in our ties with Washington and European capitals is crucial not only for securing some concessions from the IMF but also to get out of the grey list of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).”
A senior executive of a chemical company was of the view that once politics cool down Islamabad will have to reconsider its policy towards India. “If you think you can improve your relationship with the West and get off the FATF’s enhanced monitoring regime without making some kind of headway with New Delhi, you are totally mistaken. I have information that our present military leadership too is in favour of resuming ties with India,” he claimed.
However, there are others who feel that the top priority has to be given to the resolution of domestic political problems. “The settlement of the outstanding issues with the IMF and the western powers is important. But more important is to tackle our domestic problems first. I cannot say if the present government will be in power after a few days or not. But in my opinion, once this crisis is over, all the parties must sit together and develop a consensus on electoral reforms so that we can have political stability. I think that the government term of five years should be curtailed to four years. We are very impatient people and a kind of fatigue starts to take over us every three to four years. If we manage to clean up our political mess, we will be able to put back the economy on the rails and end our international isolation.”

2022-03-20,2022-03-21,"IMF seeks details of petrol, power subsidy funding",Finance minister makes it clear there are no more outstanding issues as the IMF only wants to ascertain sources of funding.,"


 
ISLAMABAD: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has sought copies of financial agreements with the provincial governments and other details from the federal government to confirm the financing of discounts on electricity and petroleum products announced by Prime Minister Imran Khan, Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin disclosed at a press conference on Sunday.
The talks with the IMF were earlier scheduled to conclude on Friday last but then “they [Fund staff] wanted to see agreements with the provinces to basically reassure we are not involved in aerial firing” on financing of PM’s relief package for petroleum prices, the minister said.
Mr Tarin made it clear that there were no more outstanding issues, as they only wanted to ascertain the sources of funding to cover the cost of reduction in electricity and petroleum products. They were assured the package would be covered through provincial shares and dividends of the state-owned entities, he said. “They said show us agreements with the provinces,” he remarked.
The federal government has signed rolling memorandums of understanding with the provinces to provide cash surplus every year to show lower consolidated fiscal deficit but are sometimes remain unhonoured when provinces also go into overdrafts.
“So there is no problem. We already have agreements that we will show them” when the two sides would meet again on Monday, the minister said, adding he would hold a final policy round up with the fund mission on Tuesday. 
The two sides will then finalise the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) amicably and take it to the executive board on a convenient date.
After initial compliance with the commitments made with the IMF in December 2021 to increase petroleum levy and power tariff, PM Khan reversed the progress by announcing Rs10 per litre reduction in petroleum products bringing down levy to zero besides a cut in electricity rates by Rs5 per unit instead of a schedule of increases agreed to with the IMF to address circular debt.
Up to 700,000-tonne wheat import
Responding to a question, Mr Tarin said all the provinces were part of the minimum wheat support price at Rs2,200 per 40 kg approved by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet last week — about 13 per cent higher than Rs1,950 of last year and showed confidence to exceed procurement target that was also set at 6.9 million tonnes last week.
He said the wheat production was then estimated to be 5pc to 6pc higher and may not require imports except 500,000 to 700,000 tonnes for strategic reserves. “I would like to increase strategic reserves from 1.8 million tonnes to two million tonnes, depending on international prices,” he said, adding he would not burn foreign exchange if international wheat prices remain higher.
In response to a question about former PML-N finance minister Miftah Ismail’s statement that the country could not launch international bonds as Pakistan’s bond yields had gone high due to economic policies and fundamentals, Mr Tarin said his statement would not change ground reality. This was not Pakistan specific but with entire developing countries including Turkey, Indonesia and others, he remarked.
Mr Tarin said financing was not an issue but the interest rates being offered were higher. He said he still had $4-5bn worth of offers from banks, but “why should I take expensive loans?” Mr Miftah should also recall they had left the government with just one-month import financing that now stood at $16.6bn – against average monthly imports of about $7bn in eight months, he added.
Responding to a question whether he would continue as finance minister in the next government if asked, Mr Tarin said he was a man of principles and would at no cost do that as he was a PTI senator. “I will remain finance minister if the PTI government stays, otherwise will go home. I am not a renegade,” he said.
He expressed the hope that 5pc economic growth rate was expected despite various headwinds this year, as some sectors were also showing robust growth including large-scale manufacturing, agriculture and exports. “This shows there is thrust in the economy and momentum is returning,” he said, adding that this did not mean there were no headwinds but policy adjustments would continue to absorb them.
“The welcome news is that the LSM has grown by 8.2pc in January against same month of last year and 4.2pc against December 2021,” he said, adding the LSM growth had slowed down in August and September 2021 but the trend had reversed. “Our economic growth momentum has picked up again as all agriculture crops are growing at 6 to 12 percent, and exports and services sectors are also growing at a high pace,” the minister pointed out.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,NA speaker summons no-trust session on 25th,"Government to file reference in SC today to end politics of ""sale and purchase"".","ISLAMABAD: In an apparent move to prolong the voting on a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan, National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser on Sunday summoned the session of the lower house of parliament on March 25, violating the Constitution under which he is bound to convene a session within 14 days after the submission of a requisition. 
Meanwhile, the government also took a significant decision under which it will file a reference in the Supreme Court on Monday (today), seeking “an opinion” of the apex court on two main points — whether the disqualification of a legislator is for life time and whether the dissident MNAs of any party can cast vote on a no-confidence resolution. 
The speaker, who under the Constitution was bound to call the NA session by March 21 [within 14 days after the opposition’s requisition], gave an excuse that since the three-day conference of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) would be held in the NA hall, there was no other place in the federal capital to convene the NA session. 
This is despite the fact that the capital offers alternative locations where such an event can be held such as the spacious Jinnah Convention Centre, Prime Minister Secretariat, Pak-China Centre, two five-star hotels, etc. 

Government to file reference in SC today to end politics of ‘sale and purchase’

The opposition lashed out at the speaker for his decision to hold the NA session on March 25, saying he had violated the Constitution to prolong the voting on no-trust motion. 
Sources in the government told Dawn that the decisions to hold the NA session on March 25 and filing of the reference in the Supreme Court were taken at a meeting presided over by Prime Minister Khan at his Banigala residence on Sunday. 
Speaker Asad Qaiser issued an order saying the [opposition’s] requisition was received on March 8 for summoning the National Assembly. Whereas, on Jan 21, 2022, a motion had been adopted by the NA to allow the exclusive use of NA chamber for the 48th session of the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers scheduled for March 22, 23 or any other date. 
He said the renovation work on the NA chamber and its lobbies had commenced on the requirement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the end of February 2022, which was under taken by the Capital Development Authority. 
The speaker said that after the receipt of [the opposition’s] requisition, the NA Secretariat requested the Senate Secretariat to provide chamber of the Senate for holding the NA session, but the latter pointed out that the Senate chamber was also not available for being under renovation. 
“Thereafter, the CDA chairman and deputy commissioner, Islamabad, were also approached to arrange and provide a suitable building for holding the session of the National Assembly outside the parliament building, at Islamabad. However, they have informed in writing that no suitable place is available at present in Islamabad for holding the NA session,” Mr Qaisar added. 
“In view of the aforementioned facts and circumstances, it is evident that no suitable place would be available for holding the session of the NA till March 24. Having no adequate option available whatsoever, for holding of the NA session before March 24, therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under clause (3) of Article 54 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, read with Article 254 of the Constitution, I hereby summon the session of the National Assembly on the first available date i.e. Friday, March 25 at 11.00am at the Parliament House, Islamabad,” the order said. 
Meanwhile, Planning and Development Minister Asad Umar said in a tweet that the government would file a reference in the Supreme Court that would end the politics of “sell and purchase” and diminish the influence of “easy money” and “influence in politics”. 



 
When contacted, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said the decision to file the reference was taken by the prime minister in a meeting on Sunday. “The basic reasons of filing the reference are — to know whether the disqualification of any legislators is for lifetime and that can PTI dissidents cast vote on the no-trust motion,” he added. 
A source said the NA speaker could call the session on March 21 to meet the constitutional requirement [within 14 days after the requisition] and adjourn the session for three days for the OIC conference and it could resume on March 24. 
According to Article 63 of the Constitution, the prime minister is given three days after the tabling of a no-trust motion, for preparation. However, the government is apparently trying to linger on the voting on the motion — first by an excuse of “lack of suitable place for the session till March 25” and then filing of the reference in the Supreme Court. 
The information minister said the government was only seeking an opinion of the apex court and it could be given by the court even on the first day of filing of the reference or the court could take more time it deemed appropriate. 
Asked why the NA session was not called on March 21, he said the NA hall was not available for the session due to the OIC summit.

2022-03-20,2022-03-21,Opposition calls for Asad Qaiser’s trial under Article 6,"PTI accused of running social media campaign against army; PML-Q wants PM to take notice of ""anti-Pakistan"" drive.","ISLAMABAD / LAHORE: Opposition parties on Sunday slammed National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser for not convening the assembly session within 14 days of its requisition to take up their no-confidence resolution against Prime Minister Imran Khan, demanding that he should be tried under Article 6 of the Constitution.
The opposition parties also lashed out at the PM for, what they called, using the religion card in an effort to save his government and accused his party of launching a ‘propaganda campaign’ through its social media team against the army over its ‘neutrality’.
Speaking at a news conference, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari expressed the hope that the Supreme Court would take notice of the violation of the Constitution by the speaker, proving that there was at least one institution in the country for the protection of the Constitution, democracy and right of the vote of the parliamentarians. 
Stating that the job of the SC was to protect and implement the Constitution, the PPP chairman hoped that the court “will not facilitate this government on its unconstitutional step” and that it would make a constitutional decision, not a political one. 

PTI accused of running social media campaign against army; PML-Q wants PM to take notice of ‘anti-Pakistan’ drive

“We appreciate how the SC sent a message of standing with the law and Constitution, even on a weekend,” he said in an apparent reference to the hearing of a petition of the Supreme Court Bar Association during which the court had reprimanded the government over the attack by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) activists on Sindh House. 
He said the SC was already hearing a petition that had not been filed by them, but the bar association. However, he said the court had issued notices to the political parties as well in the case and they would present their viewpoint before it. 
“This coward captain [the PM] is running away from the vote of no confidence. He is escaping to the extent that he has made the speaker abrogate the Constitution,” the PPP chairman observed. 
Mr Bhutto-Zardari lashed out at PM Khan for using Islam for party politics and asked him not to use the slogan of Madinah state. 
“You (the PM) are the foreign-sponsored and foreign-funded agent who has been planted in our system,” he said while criticising the government’s foreign policy. He alleged that the prime minister had been given the task to damage the country’s foreign policy and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and that he had done it “beautifully”. 
He accused Mr Khan of adopting the foreign policy of India, stating that there was no difference in the foreign policies of the two countries. 
Addressing a separate news conference, PML-N’s senior vice-president Shahid Khaqan Abbasi also accused the speaker and the premier of violating the Constitution and committing treason under Article 6 which, he said, was not a joke. He said if anyone would interfere in the democratic process of no-trust move, he would commit ‘treason’. 
PML-N secretary general Ahsan Iqbal alleged that Mr Khan was using religion card to cover up his “dirty politics and incompetence”. 
Earlier, in a statement, PML-N information secretary Marriyum Aurangzeb stated if the speaker failed to convene the NA session before March 22, he would be guilty of violating the Constitution that was be punishable under Article 6. 
Campaign against institutions
During the news conference, the PPP chairman also alleged that the PM and his social media team had launched a ‘propaganda campaign’ to ‘provoke’ an institution so that it could not remain ‘neutral’. 
“When a time has come when the media is talking about a neutral environment, Imran and his social media team are trying to spread the propaganda that institutions are not neutral, be it through provocation or creating a constitutional crisis,” he said.
“It is the responsibility of all of us to demand and try for every institution to work within its domain drawn by the law and Constitution, and to criticise when this does not happen. However, it is also our responsibility to oppose the prime minister, his social media team and its members who are provoking and targeting an institution under a conspiracy,” he added.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari said the prime minister had equated the term ‘neutral’ with animals and had still not apologised to the nation over it. “Our efforts have always been for neutrality. The PM, his social media team and ministers are making desperate attempts to tarnish neutrality. We condemn this,” he said without elaborating.
The PPP chairman, who had not named the institution during his press conference, later asked the Inter-Service Public Relations and the judiciary to take notice of the propaganda campaign by the PM, his social media team and the MNAs aimed at getting “the status of neutrality” changed.
Though Mr Bhutto-Zardari did not give any reference to the army when he talked about the allegation regarding the propaganda campaign against neutrality, the PML-Q and the PML-N came out more openly when they castigated the PTI government for hitting out at army and Inter-Service Intelligence by a party’s woman MNA and an important member of the PTI’s media team. 
A video clip with the audio of PTI MNA Kanwal Shauzeb shared from a twitter space “Current political situation” went viral on social media in which she could be heard apparently talking about military establishment. “They have nothing to do with performance and neither they want to manage the country. They had never done it in the past, then why will they do it now. Actually, they wanted to hijack the system and working on an agenda of minus-Imran Khan,” she said in the clip, adding that the real issue was that the premier was not allowing those sitting in “different institutions and all kinds of institutions to continue their loot and plunder” and “that’s why they are now having panic attacks”.
Since Saturday afternoon, an unusual debate has started on Twitter with a host of people, apparently the PTI supporters, trying to make the army leadership controversial by levelling all kinds of accusations. They were found accusing the army chief of trying to undermine the government and the present system. 
In response, several people also came out in support of the armed forces, blaming the present government of maligning the armed forces and its chief.
Reacting over the clip, PML-Q MNA Chaudhry Salik Hussain tweeted: “The PTI’s social media team and a woman MNA levelled false allegations on the Pakistan Army and the ISI, which are unacceptable and unbearable.” 
Mr Hussain demanded that the PM must take notice of this “dirty anti-Pakistan campaign, otherwise, the PML-Q knew well how to deal with the anti-Pakistan elements”.



 
Also, the official spokesman for PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif, Malik Ahmad Khan, tweeted that the PTI social media team would not be allowed to defame the Pakistan Army. “The state’s existence gets threatened when a state army’s central authority is compromised,” he said. 



 
“When a state will not respect the status of the institution of army, can a state survive?” he asked in a linked tweet. “The strong army is a guarantor of strong Pakistan,” the spokesman said, adding that every Pakistani was ready to sacrifice his life for country’s solidarity and progress.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Jahangir Tareen group sees their demands being met,A senior party leader in Punjab says the PM has agreed to remove CM Buzdar but wants the dissident group to wait for a while.,"LAHORE: Members of the dissident Jahangir Tareen group in the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) appear confident they will have their way after securing guarantees that the chief minister of Punjab will be removed from office.
Sources in the group told Dawn that Prime Minister Imran Khan had all but “agreed” to accept the demands of the dissident group, but has sought more time to remove Chief Minister Usman Buzdar in order to “avert the impression of being blackmailed”.
Shaken by a no-confidence motion against the premier, the PTI government is on a mission to mend ways with party dissidents. A senior delegation of government members met the Jahangir Tareen group and asked them to explain their concerns and demands in detail.
“The Tareen group remains adamant over the removal of Usman Buzdar and explained their concerns with regards to victimisation, lukewarm response from Chief Minister Office to their problems and the bureaucracy’s attitude towards their group members,” a source in the Tareen group told Dawn.
A senior party leader in Punjab told Dawn the prime minister had agreed to remove CM Buzdar but wanted the dissident group to wait for a while, because an immediate acceptance of the demand would be exploited by the opposition as if “Imran Khan has bowed down to dissidents’ blackmail”.
The PTI government had also conveyed that the new chief minister would be from PTI parliamentarians, the senior party leader said, adding that the Tareen group assured the government team that it did not want to leave the party until it would be compelled to do so.
Problems being resolved
Meanwhile, key Tareen group member Lala Tahir Randhawa said a government team led by cabinet minister Murad Raas had called on the group and agreed to resolve problems that could be addressed through the administration.
Since the government team had been given two days to resolve the parliamentarians’ issue, Mr Randhawa said a response had started to come, as deputy commissioners, district police officers and other government officials were calling all group members to address their problems.
He said that actions taken to victimise him and provincial minister Ajmal Cheema were also being undone. “The government team will return with its problems’ resolution report and the group will meet on Wednesday to take a final decision,” he added.
Mr Randhawa asserted that the group’s main demand was “minus-Buzdar” because the incumbent chief minister had ruined the governance system in the country. “Another large group of MPAs have also contacted the Tareen group and expressed support for its demand of removing Buzdar from Punjab’s chief ministership,” Mr Randhawa revealed.
Answering a question about PTI dissident and former senior minister Abdul Aleem Khan’s conduct with the group after visiting it at Jahangir Tareen’s residence, Mr Randhawa said Aleem Khan did come and a five-member committee was constituted — including Mr Randhawa, Nauman Langrial, Abdul Hayee Dasti and Ajmal Cheema — to coordinate with Aleem Khan. However, Aleem Khan did not call the committee and he alone met Sindh Governor Imran Ismail, who visited him on the instructions of the prime minister.
Sources said the government had conveyed to the Tareen group that CM Buzdar would be replaced by another senior leader within the party and four names have started doing the rounds in the PTI parliamentarians’ circle, including those of provincial minister Raja Yasir Humayun, Murad Raas, Mian Aslam Iqbal and Asif Nakai.
Tareen group members told Dawn that 13 of their 17 MPAs were elected as independents and later joined the party. “Even if the Tareen group decided to vote against PM Imran Khan in the centre and CM Buzdar in Punjab, the government would not be able to de-seat them because they were not elected on PTI tickets,” Mr Randhawa told Dawn.
Tareen ‘held party together’
Meanwhile, Jahangir Tareen’s spokesman Awn Chaudhry said some eight MNAs were standing with the group and take a decision about supporting or not supporting the government in the opposition’s no-confidence motion.
“I was personally disturbed when I saw that several MNAs stood against the party,” he said and added that it all happened because PM Khan pushed away Jahangir Tareen, who was actually keeping all MNAs intact with the party.
“Mr Tareen used to help the prime minister in difficult times and resolve party parliamentarians’ problems,” he said and asked whether the PTI should not hold the premier’s political aides accountable for all this mess.
Answering a question whether Jahangir Tareen could enter into any deal with the PML-N, he said he could not comment on his leader’s behalf. “Whatever Jahangir Tareen will decide, his whole group will go along his decision,” he asserted.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,RED ZONE FILES: All set for a collision course,Some govt officials have started to acknowledge in private that prospects of surviving this challenge from opposition are slim.,"Political entanglements may once again be headed to the courts. 
Speaker Asad Qaiser has summoned the crucial session of the National Assembly on Friday, March 25, which is three days longer than the Constitution has stipulated once the required number of parliamentarians have requisitioned a session. This order further complicates a situation that is fraught with danger and uncertainty. Here’s where things stand today and what they could portend in the coming days:

The PTI government is doing legal gymnastics with constitutional procedures, but there is no way around the vote of no-confidence against Prime Minister Imran Khan. The only way that the PM can retain his job is if the opposition fails to muster a strength of 172 in the lower house during the vote. Or if for some reason, the opposition withdraws the motion. There is no other way out for the PM and his cabinet. Legal experts say the speaker may attempt to delay the process and push the vote forward, and this may ultimately end up in courts, but the vote will need to take place one way or another. What matters is the numbers game. Everything else is a side show.
The courts may in fact become the battleground before the real battle on the floor of the National Assembly. If both the government and the opposition head to the Supreme Court with their petitions, the court may need to pronounce on the following: (i) if Article 63 of the constitution allows the party head to stop errant members of his party from voting on the confidence motion (ii) if the disqualification under Article 3 for members indulging in floor crossing can be a lifetime ban (iii) if the speaker can delay summoning of the National Assembly for more than the two-week limit spelt out in the Constitution and whether he can somehow delay the moving of the motion for the vote of no confidence. 
These issues will be addressed by the Supreme Court this week and a lot will depend on how long the SC takes to pronounce a decision. According to legal experts, if the SC reaffirms the obvious interpretation of the constitutional procedure for the vote of no-confidence, then the government will have no other option but to fight the numbers game, which it appears to be losing at this stage.
The planned rallies by the government and the opposition on Sunday, March 27, have added an explosive element to the volatile situation. Inside the Red Zone, there is a genuine fear that if these rallies are allowed to take place as scheduled, then there is a danger of violence breaking out. Now, imagine the real danger: when such violence ensues between a sitting government and its opponents, what does the police do? And if the police cannot handle such a scenario, the only option is what Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid has been referring to in his speeches: handing over security responsibility to the armed forces.
There is no need for the situation to deteriorate to such a level. But it is being dragged towards such an outcome by the government itself. What is otherwise a straightforward constitutional procedure is being weaponised by the use of mobs and threats. These in turn are being used to fuel a new narrative that focuses on accusations of horse-trading as a means to undermine a democratic process. What is being deliberately ignored is that such allegations need to be proved in a court of law for any action to be taken. They are handy for political sloganeering but cannot be used to counter what is purely a constitutional and legal process.
The government allies have stitched up their agreements with the opposition but according to Red Zone insiders, they will hold back formal announcements till after the OIC foreign ministers’ meeting. Despite the ups and downs of this week and the increase in political temperatures, the PML-Q, MQM and BAP are still locked into an understanding whose final details are being stitched up. One parliamentarian from the allied parties said their decision was intact as per the understanding reached.
One key challenge for the opposition is to keep its members safe, secure and available in Islamabad. This has led to daily congregations for dinners where the leaders keep an eye on their flock while also ensuring that none are under any pressure or facing threats. Opposition insiders say this is harder than it sounds as these elected members have a strong gravitational pull from their constituencies and yet cannot be allowed to disperse from Islamabad at a crucial time when every single vote counts.
While it is clear that the vote of no confidence will take place in a matter of days, there remain some uncertainties that are becoming a source of concern: (i) if PM Khan is on a collision course – as is evident from his speeches, including the one on Sunday – is there a way the system can be saved from instability without the opposition ceding space to him? (ii) Will the establishment be forced to intervene if matters start to spin out of control (iii) what will happen if the PM decides to use the ‘nuclear option’ of firing a senior official and appointing a new one in his place?
Some senior government officials have started to acknowledge in private that their prospects of surviving this challenge from the opposition are slim. They are now also admitting that the root cause of the dire situation they find themselves in today is the unnecessary and avoidable confrontation with the establishment. 
Yet they are now locked into a predicament that can only reinforce itself if the PTI government falls. The narrative being stitched together by the party leadership will likely further accentuate the source of the conflict and could trigger greater political instability.

The Red Zone is under stress. The coming ten days will determine if it can sustain it.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Cases of femicide rising sharply in Iraqi Kurdistan,11 women were killed in the first two months of this year...,"SULAIMANIYAH: A woman burned alive by her husband, others shot dead by a father or a teenage brother — bloody violence against women has spiked in northern Iraq’s Kurdish region.
The autonomous area, keen on projecting an image of a relative haven of stability and tolerance in war-battered Iraq, has seen a sharp rise in femicide, killings motivated by gender.
“In the past two months, there has been an increase in femicide compared to the previous year,” said Hiwa Karim Jwamir of the Kurdish General Directorate for Combating Violence Against Women.
In the first two months of 2022, 11 women were killed in autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan, most of them shot, said the official based in Sulaimaniyah.
Forty-five women were killed in 2021, up from 25 the previous year, said Jwamir.

11 women were killed in the first two months of this year

On a Friday before dawn, a 15-year-old teenager was fatally wounded by six bullets fired by her father in the village of Soran. The man told police his daughter “went out with two boys late at night”, according to a domestic violence unit which also records so-called “honour killings”.
Across Iraq, gender-based violence rose 125 per cent to over 22,000 cases between 2020 and 2021, says the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund, which has also pointed to “a worrisome increase in depression and suicide among women and girls”. Last December, a 16-year-old girl was disfigured with acid in Baghdad by an adult who wanted to marry her but had been rejected.
For years, activists have denounced violence against women and forced marriages in Iraq, which remains a conservative and patriarchal society.
“Cases of violence against women are on the rise,” said long-time Kurdistan activist Bahar Munzir, director of local group the People’s Development Organisation.
“Most of the women who are killed are victims of a family member.”
A few days before International Women’s Day on March 8, the body of a 20-year-old woman was found on the side of the road in Arbil, the capital of Kurdistan.
Maria Sami, the victim, was known on social networks for her feminist speeches.
The following day, on March 9, Kirkuk police announced the arrest of the killer, her 18-year-old brother.
While he was still on the run, he spoke by phone to a Kurdish television channel and tried to justify the killing by charging his sister had failed to obey the family. In February, mother-of-two Shinyar Huner Rafiq died in hospital, five days after being admitted with serious burns.
“Her husband had come home one evening in a state of intoxication,” Shinyar’s father, Huner Rafiq, told AFP.
“He doused her body in gasoline and set it on fire.” After the father reported the killing, police arrested the husband. “Before dying, Shinyar told us the facts,” said the bereaved father. “We recorded it, and we submitted the video to the investigators.”
Kurdistan’s prime minister Masrour Barzani denounced the “horrific case”, saying he was “deeply troubled” by the spate of violent attacks against women.
The government must impose “the heaviest possible penalty on perpetrators”, he said in a statement.
“There is no honour in honour killings. I’m determined to protect every woman, girl and child from abuse ... This scourge must end.”
In early February, Dohuk police said they had found the corpse of Doski Azad, a 23-year-old transgender woman who had been ostracised by family members.
An arrest warrant was issued to find the suspected murderer: the victim’s brother, who had in recent years been living in Europe.
He had called his family to inform them of his crime and of where the body was, according to police.
The murder was condemned by the UN mission in Iraq, and the consulates of Western countries in Arbil.
The news provoked a torrent of hatred online — against the victim, even though some voices defended minorities’ rights.
In June 2011, Kurdistan passed a law criminalising domestic violence and female genital mutilation.
The law, which threatens life in prison for “honour” crimes, was hailed by non-governmental groups as a major step forward. But the law’s enforcement is hampered by a climate of impunity and a common fear of speaking out.
“When a woman is killed, the procedures of the security services are not the same as when it’s a man, the trial is not the same,” said Munzir, the activist.
“Some cases don’t even make it to court. They are subject to tribal resolution between the man’s family and that of his wife, the victim.“

2022-01-12,2022-03-21,Committee set up to identify officers involved in leasing out Monal Restaurant,"Body asked to assess the transparency of bidding process, comparison of rent rates offered by the lease.","ISLAMABAD: A four-member committee has been formed by the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to identify officers who were involved in processing and leasing out Monal Restaurant and other buildings in the protected area of Margalla Hills National Park (MHNP). 
This has been done in compliance with the orders of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Jan 12, 2022. According to a notification issued by the CDA’s Confidential Wing, the committee is supposed to complete its task within 15 days “so that disciplinary proceedings could be initiated against the delinquent officers/officials”.
Sources in the wing said Deputy Director General Land and Estate Afnan Alam would head the committee while Deputy Financial Adviser Khawaja Aizad Hussain, Director Laboratory Khalid Nawaz and Director Regional Planning Fraz Malik will be its members.

Body asked to assess transparency of bidding process, comparison of rent rates offered by the lease and accepted by the then CDA administration

The notification of the committee, which was issued on March 10, and is available with Dawn, tasked the committee to “identify officer involved in processing/leasing of land/structure of Monal Restaurant in the protected area of National Park in violation of the Act of 1997, Ordinance of 1960, Ordinance of 1966, Ordinance of 1979 and the regulations made under the respective statutes”.
According to the terms of reference (TORs), the committee has been given the task to identify factors behind construction of Monal Restaurant and other buildings in the protected area as it was in violation of various acts and ordinances.
The committee has been directed to “assess the transparency of bidding process for leasing of Monal to a private entity and comparison of rent rates offered by the lease and accepted by the then CDA administration with the then market prices for facilities of similar size and nature, identify/mention relevant provision of laws and regulations, infringed while allowing construction/lease of the Monal Resturant and to ascertain the loss/ damages to wildlife, flora and fauna and environmental changes in National Park due to said construction of the restaurant”.
While hearing a petition related to Monal Restaurant, the IHC in January this year had ordered the CDA and Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) to seal the building and start proceedings against other buildings that were operating in the national park in violation of rules.
Following the said orders, the CDA and ICT administration sealed the restaurant.
However, the Supreme Court on March 9, suspended the Jan 11 IHC judgement of sealing and taking over possession of the restaurant.
“The unsigned order of the IHC will remain suspended,” ordered a three-judge Supreme Court bench headed by Justice Ijazul Ahsan. Consequently, Monal Restaurant was de-sealed.
The court, which had taken up the appeal of Monal Group of Companies, pointed out why no action was taken against the other 13 restaurants situated in close proximity of Monal and why Monal was discriminated against only and on what basis, its possession was taken over without the certified copy of the high court.
The IHC had ordered the CDA and IWMB to take over forthwith the possession of the restaurant and seal its premises, subject to allowing its owner/management to take out their property. 
The CDA, after construction of the restaurant, had leased it out to a private firm for 15 years and the lease agreement expired last year. 
However, a few years before the expiry of agreement, the lessee started paying rent to the military, which stated that the land where Monal was constructed belonged to them in accordance with a notification issued in 1912.
IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah rejected the military ownership’s claim over the land and ordered recovery of all the rent paid by the Monal Restaurant management. 
The court had also asked the defence ministry to ensure that the amount received as rent was deposited in the exchequer.
“The claim of Remount, Veterinary and Farms Directorate of Pakistan Army, regarding 8,068 acres of land in the notified national park area is in 
violation of the Ordinance of 1979, read with the Ordinance of 1960, and the [Islamabad] Master Plan,” the IHC had declared.
The IHC chief justice had also directed civic agencies to seal the sprawling naval golf course located in the national park area and unless an environmentally-friendly use can be found for it, ordered its demolition within four weeks.
A senior CDA officer confirmed that the inquiry committee had been formed and added that the committee was yet to hold its first meeting.

The statement of traffic police stated that SSP Rai Mazhar proposed to the Capital Development Authority to make the highway signal free.
The project has saved Rs7.5 billion as instead of constructing overhead bridges, the corridor was made signal free by constructing protected U-turns. 
The data of the police showed that over 115,000 vehicles enter and leave from Islamabad Chowk to Zero Point. As they will travel on the signal-free corridor, it will save around 100,000 man hours of people.
On an average four people travel in a vehicle so if each vehicle saves 15 minutes the entire saving of time of four persons will be one hour, the statement said.
Chief Commissioner Islamabad Amer Ali Ahmed had appreciated the proposal of SSP traffic and directed immediate implementation of the proposal. 
Now the Srinagar Highway has been made signal free by constructing three protective U-turns that connected Islamabad and Rawalpindi with the new airport.
All foreign guests and dignitaries use this road while travelling to and from the airport.
The duration of the travel to Islamabad airport would reduce to half.
This will help solve traffic jam by 60 to 70pc while travelling time to Islamabad airport will also reduce considerably, the SSP (Traffic) said.

2022-03-20,2022-03-21,Islamabad sees decline in Covid-19 mortality rate,Fafen’s findings stress the need for continued vigilance,"ISLAMABAD: As vaccination against Covid-19 has surpassed the figure of 90pc in the federal capital, the city has seen a reduction in mortality rate.
According to data, only 133 cases were reported in the city during the last one week, with the positivity ratio remaining at 1pc. 
On the other hand, Rawalpindi reported five positive cases on Sunday.
In another development, the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) launched a report on Sunday that covered Pakistan’s Covid-19 response during January-February 2022.

Fafen’s findings stress the need for continued vigilance

During the last few weeks, the fifth wave of the pandemic has been losing severity in the country, which can be gauged from the fact that the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) has decided to lift all restrictions for fully-vaccinated people.
Talking to Dawn, District Health Officer Islamabad Dr Zaeem Zia said though the city had surpassed the figure of 90pc, in terms of complete vaccination, it should be considered around 95pc as a number of residents of the city were outside the country.
“The reduced mortality rate shows credibility of vaccination in the city. Despite the fact that Islamabad has a large number of medical tourism, the mortality rate is almost zero,” he added.
While sharing the weekly data, Dr Zia said in the last week of January, the city observed the highest positivity rate of 16.45pc which then gradually started to decline, reaching 1pc during the last week.
The data showed that on Sunday, the capital reported 21 Covid-19 patients and the infection rate of 1.32pc.
Meanwhile,five people tested positive in Rawalpindi district and four recovered during the last 24 hours.
According to the health authority’s data, the positivity ratio in the district was 0.56pc. A total of 892 samples were collected out of which results of 887 people came back negative.
There are 76 active patients in Rawalpindi district as of March 20, with three patients admitted to hospitals and 73 home isolated.
Two patients surfaced from the cantonment areas and one patient each from Kallar Syedan, Taxila and Islamabad. There is no patient on ventilator, however one is on oxygen and the other two are stable.
On the other hand, a report of the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) has observed varying healthcare capacities across regions and districts during the fifth wave of Covid-19 that remained a major challenge and key concern.
With the onset of Omicron variant in December last year, confirmed cases jumped to 133,839 in January – the highest since the start of the pandemic – while the number of recoveries was recorded at 38,366.
Compared to January, cases started to decline in February. The health authorities recorded 79,855 confirmed cases and 147,548 recoveries in the month.
Fafen’s findings of the third pandemic governance monitoring report, released on Sunday, reinforced the need for consistent and continued vigilance and the necessity of both medium and long-term structural and policy changes built on the lessons learnt.
Compared to the earlier waves, the report highlighted a broad two-pronged pandemic response to the fifth surge of Covid-19 that helped Pakistan withstand and manage the challenges relatively well.
The first aspect of the response comprised varying levels of restrictions and targeted measures in areas with high positivity ratio.
The second wave comprised a parallel push for increased vaccination and broadening the eligible population section to include the 12-16 age group. A remarkable increase of 30 million to the fully vaccinated column during the first two months of the ongoing year is a testament to the seriousness accorded to the effort, the report said. 
Despite a slow start, Pakistan’s vaccination drive gained significant momentum, reaching an average of one million doses per day by the end of last year.
Pakistan had administered 216.9 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine by the first week of March 2022. Approximately 100 million people were fully vaccinated (65pc of the vaccine eligible population and 44pc of the total estimated population), whereas around 127.5 million are ‘partially vaccinated’ as per the information provided by the NCOC website and their official twitter account.
As assessed in the report, had the Omicron variant been as severe as the earlier variants, it would have seriously tested the healthcare system — a factor that shall not be lost on policymakers responsible for responding to any new variant of Covid-19 or a completely new pandemic.
For instance, the availability of beds, ventilators and doctors within the observed districts showed that the healthcare system in Pakistan was still under-equipped — more so in some areas than others.
If the situation had necessitated the hospitalisation of those infected, the number of patients per ventilator and patients per bed would have resulted in severe consequences for some of the districts.
For instance, Karak district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa would have 21,132 and 1,023 patients per ventilator and bed respectively, followed by Mardan with 669 patients per ventilator and 324 patients per bed, and Rawalpindi with 204 patients per ventilator and four patients per bed.
The private sector has played a significant role in providing services and facilities that have contributed to the overall pandemic governance and response. However, there remains the need for more effective regulation, especially regarding the pricing of critical services.
However, what remains a key concern for the government is the issue of price regulation.
Attendants of patients interviewed at various health facilities highlighted the significant variance in test pricing. The respondents claimed to have paid prices ranging between Rs1,000 and Rs15,000 or more.

Talking to Dawn, the minister said a fully funded Annual Development Programme (ADP) of Rs1.4 billion was approved for the construction of the university campus. He said the project was the joint ownership of the city as locals contributed funds towards raising different buildings.
The foundation of UoC was laid by Prime Minister Imran Khan near Balkasar area two years ago, which is nearing completion, Mr Sarfraz said.
The request for establishment of the city campus was also submitted to the Punjab government so that students of Chakwal city did not travel 16km to Balkasar daily, he said.
The PC-I for the city campus has been approved and Rs1.4 billion allocated for the construction of the campus, the minister said.
“Two academic blocks, an admin block and male and female hostels would be built and renovation carried out with the fund,” the provincial minister said, adding that construction of the city campus would be completed by 2024.
“The Ministry of Higher Education was my favourite portfolio that has played a constructive role in the establishment of a public university in Chakwal. The engineering campus of the university in Balkasar is under construction and is expected to finish by the next year,” Mr Sarfraz said.
“Campuses of the university would be spread in different areas of Chakwal including Chakwal city, Balkasar and Murid. Land is being acquired in Murid area of Chakwal for construction of several facilities. The vision for this university is to have 30,000-40,000 students and to be an exemplary university of the Rawalpindi Division,” he said, adding that there was no major public university in the division like Lahore, Multan and Faisalabad.
He said: “Many intelligent female students from different areas of Chakwal were deprived of higher education as they were not allowed to get admissions in far-off cities. Now, those students would benefit the most as they can get higher education near their homes. To further create educational facilities for female students who cannot study in co-educational institutions due to conservative backgrounds, female government colleges in Chakwal and Talagang have been affiliated with the UoC and upgraded for BS programmes.”

2022-03-23,2022-03-21,"Another body set up to curb celebratory fire, kite flying","Provincial committee had expressed concern over the menace, suggested strict police action","RAWALPINDI: In the wake of the decision of the Provincial Bird Hazard Control Committee (PBHCC), another body comprising representatives of the district administration, district police, Solid Waste Management Company and Nur Khan Air Base has been formed to effectively eliminate hazards such as celebratory firing, kite flying, pigeon homing and solid waste disposal.
In a letter to City Police Officer (CPO) Omer Saeed Malik, the provincial committee expressed its concern over the menace of celebratory firing and suggested that strict action needed to be taken by the police.
In its recent meeting, the committee discussed preventive measures related to March 23, 2022, when an increased number of aircraft will be flying from different Pakistan Air Force (PAF) bases. Safe flying operations during the fly past are of utmost importance, the members emphasised.

Provincial committee had expressed concern over the menace, suggested strict police action

It was also recommended that the authorities concerned conduct regular surveys and take swift action against all garbage dumps and place a strict ban on wasting food and other similar items, especially within 12 to 15 kilometres around airfields and airports.
Bird control is the responsibility of the airport management since bird shooters are deployed in the area, particularly near runways, and other preventative steps usually need to be taken to avoid any mishap.
“Since celebratory firing has become a real menace to the security of airspace, strict action has to be taken against it,” the committee stated, adding that a survey of marriage halls should be conducted and it should be made sure that there is no celebratory fire in the wake of important events taking place at the venue of the March 23 fly past and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) council of foreign ministers conference.
The CPO Rawalpindi was also asked to take strict action against firing in the air and to submit a report to the office of commissioner Rawalpindi on a fortnightly basis.
The Punjab government had already asked law enforcement agencies to execute Section 144 and devise a strategy to implement a policy on pigeon homing, kite flying, use of laser lights and drones near airbases and airports.
Following the increasing trend of kite flying, the PBHCC had been formed in March 2020 which had held its first meeting under the chair of the chief secretary of Punjab in Lahore.
Besides monitoring celebratory firing, the district police have been taking strict action against kite flyers and have seized a number of kites and arrested many sellers during ongoing crackdown.
When asked about the security level put in place in the city regarding defence day, the CPO said: “The security has been placed at red-alert level, though there has been no specific threat but we are not taking it lightly as doing all possible security measures, including conducting search operations, specifically in border areas.”
All the stake holders had been intimated by the committee to nominate their representatives for the other committee so that effective measures should be taken to prevent celebratory firing.

The IFFP 2022 was fundraising for charity with Voices Society, which is an organisation that worked for the benefit of differently-abled people. 
Designers, included Nina Naustdal, whose philosophy is ‘normal is boring’. All her pieces were handcrafted. Her premise was reflected in all her dresses.
Ahmed Bilal’s designs struck an almost unattainable balance between two contradictory states, whimsicality and boldness for the woman who stood apart from the crowd, high on her femininity and confident in her attitude. 
They catered to the modern woman on the move, comfortable to wear yet exquisitely put together.

The PML-N Rawalpindi chapter also warned Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed that its workers would make his entry into Rawalpindi difficult.
In a meeting of party workers on Sunday, PML-N Metropolitan President and former mayor Sardar Naseem said Sheikh Rashid Ahmed was the biggest ‘lota’ (turncoat) who had ditched PML-N when Gen Pervez Musharraf came into power.

Workers asked to accord warm welcome to rally led by Maryam, Hamza

“Once the workers decide to ban your entry, you (Sheikh Rashid) will not be able to enter Lal Haveli,” Mr Naseem said.
He said his party had told workers and supporters to get ready for the power show in Islamabad on March 27 and protect the parliamentarians from PTI’s goons.
The meeting decided that women workers would provide protection to the party’s women lawmakers and youth wing to the party’s leadership on March 27.
It also asked the party’s supporters to bring at least 200 people from each union council.
All union council chairmen will lead their separate rallies and join the main rally led by Hanif Abbasi and Sardar Naseem in the city and Malik Abrar and Daniyal Chaudhry in the cantonment areas.
Talking to Dawn, Mayor Sardar Naseem said his party’s workers would welcome the rally led by Maryam Nawaz and Hamza Shehbaz and join them on their way to Islamabad.
“All party workers and supporters will go to Islamabad in the shape of rallies led by former MNA Hanif Abbasi, former MPAs Raja Hanif, Ziaullah Shah and others. Women wing, youth wing, student federation and minority and labour wings will bring their separate rallies,” Mr Naseem said.
He said the PML-N had finalised the plan to counter arrest and if the interior ministry tried to sabotage their peaceful rally, party workers from every street and area of the garrison city would foil its attempt.
“Rawalpindi is the fort of the PML-N which can be seen from the results of the local government elections in the cantonment areas from where not a single PTI member got elected,” he added.
He said in the last three years, the PTI government had done nothing for the residents of Rawalpindi and now Imran Khan had threatened to bring people to Islamabad.
“In Rawalpindi, many PTI local leaders are contacting PML-N as they want to join the party,” he claimed.

2022-03-31,2022-03-21,Over 50pc independent female candidates contesting local govt polls in KP,ISLAMABAD: The independent women contestants outnumbered the combined tally of women candidates fielded by the...,"ISLAMABAD: The independent women contestants outnumbered the combined tally of women candidates fielded by the political parties for the Neighborhood and Village Councils in the second phase of local government elections being held in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) on March 31.
Overall, the independent female candidates constitute 51pc as against 27pc and 22pc women fielded by liberal and religious parties respectively.
This was revealed by Pattan, an NGO that works for democracy, human rights and gender equality in a report released here on Sunday.
It said reserved seats remained vacant or being won without any contest, a phenomenon that had also been seen in the first phase of the polls.
According to Pattan, lack of political will appears to be mainly responsible for low rate of female participation in local elections.
The second phase of local election shows that on an average only 1.76 female candidates are in the field against one seat, while seat to candidate ratio on other categories of seats is much high. For instance, on average there are 10 candidates against one seat for chairmen/mayor category.
Pattan argues that prior conditions (female literacy rate, human development level, women’s participation in labour force and access to public life, etc.,) appear to have played a major role in determining the level of women’s participation in the election.
Because of the existing differentiation, women’s participation as candidates varies from district to district. For instance, in Lower and Upper Kohistan – extremely poor and underdeveloped districts --about 90pc women seats remained vacant. 
In Battagram, out of total 90 female seats as many as 71 or 79pc remained vacant.
In South Waziristan too, more than 68pc of female seats remained vacant, while in Abbottabad, only 32 or 15pc of the 209 seats are vacant. 
In Upper Chitral, female candidates did not leave a single seat vacant.
However, there appears significant variations across districts. 
For instance, share of religious parties is higher than liberal parties in six districts - Mansehra 16pc, North Waziristan 36pc and Kurram 36pc, and Orakzai 32%. The liberal parties have clear edge over religious parties in eight districts - Upper Chitral 33pc, Lower Dir 49pc, Malakand 44pc, Shangla 43pc, Swat 50pc and Upper Dir 57pc. 
In 11 districts the independent candidates constitute clear majority in comparison to combined strength of all parties. 
In Abbottabad 88pc, Battagram 94pc, Upper Chitral 56pc, Lower Chitral 64pc, Mansehra 84pc, North Waziristan 53pc, South Waziristan 81pc, Orakzai 56pc, and Shangla 50pc.
Analysis of the contestation data (ECP Form X List of Contesting Candidates) also reveals some interesting socio-political trends:
1) High participation of female candidates even in the conservative or traditional districts than the combined female candidates of political parties is a clear sign of emergence of new social forces that are ready to play an important role in local governance.
2) Political parties appear to be ignorant of their emergence and have little appetite to broaden and deepen democracy and to avail this opportunity.
3) Political parties seem to be more interested in top positions i.e. mayors and chairpersons than in the quota seats of the marginalised sections of the society.
4) As a large number of women seats will remain vacant even after by-election female populations of many Neighborhood and Village Councils of KPK are likely to be deprived of women representatives.
Pattan’s analysis is primarily based on the ECP’s Form X (list of contesting candidates) of 17 districts.
The Pattan in it’s recommendations said the ECP should make available data and forms of every election promptly.
It said political parties need to invest resources to set up party chapters at grassroots level and must also hold internal party election and ECP should monitor their polling processes.
It also said civil society, women groups and trade unions should plan to field candidates against quota seats.

The event —Implementation research in healthcare quality and safety — was organised by Riphah Institute of Healthcare Improvement & Safety in partnership with World Health Organisation, Imperial College London, City University London, National Institute of Health, Islamabad and Martin Dow Group.
The conference covered topics ranging from infection prevention and control, patient safety in dentistry, role of nursing, implementation of health policies and research, to leadership in healthcare, pharmacovigilance and the role of virtual reality in surgical training.
In his recorded message, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health Dr Faisal Sultan explained why it’s important to focus on patient safety. “This is a serious health issue requiring our immediate attention. Better safety measures improve patient experience, health outcomes, well-being of the healthcare team as well as reduce costs,” he said.

PM’s aide Dr Sultan says 20pc to 40pc of health spending wasted due to poor quality care

Globally, Dr Sultan pointed out, 20 per cent to 40pc of health spending went wasted due to poor quality care and 15pc of hospital costs were on account of harm caused to patients.
“These statistics remind us that patient safety is critical in healthcare. In Pakistan, we need to move towards people-centred care, while paying attention to public health needs and expectations of the community to improve patient safety.”
He appreciated efforts on part of the event organisers and said discussions on the forum would encourage stakeholders to take practical measures in this field.
AI transforming healthcare future
In a session on the future of healthcare, LNH medical director Dr Salman Faridi said artificial intelligence was transforming the future of healthcare as it provided several advantages over traditional clinical decision-making.
On medical error reduction and prevention, he said chances of errors during treatment always existed and like other professionals, doctors should also be forgiven for the error.
In his presentation, Dr Zakiuddin said there was an immediate need to introduce the concept of ‘homspital’ in society where patients were provided healthcare services at home.
“There are several factors in play leading to the emergence of a new hospital structure. These forces include changes in patient population and their needs, advances in clinical knowledge and technology, impact of digital technology, higher patient expectation, difficulties in attracting and retaining an appropriate skilled workforce, financial and funding challenges and growing requirements to measure quality.”
Sharing some data on digital medical / health applications, he said their numbers were increasing rapidly. “Currently, we have 300,000 apps on iOS and Android compared to the approximately 165,000 available in 2015.”
Dr Zakiuddin concluded his presentation by emphasising that doctors and nurses were facing burnouts and to prevent them, the phenomenon of ‘homspital’ should be introduced as soon as possible.
Sindh Health Minister Azra Fazal Pechuho, Prof Paul Barach of Wayne State University, Dr Aziz Sheikh from the University of Edinburgh and Prof Allen Meador from the University of North Carolina, were among the speakers.

Khuhro said at a press conference at Larkana Press Club on Sunday that speaker of National Assembly had acted unconstitutionally by convening session on March 25. 
The opposition had submitted requisition on March 8 after which he was to convene the session within 14 days but if voting on no-confidence motion was not carried out on the date and attempt was made to impose governor’s rule in Sindh, it would prove disastrous, he warned. 
He said the speaker could not prorogue the session without going ahead with no-trust motion the day the session was convened. By holding the session late, the prime minister had attempted to make the speaker a scapegoat, he said. 
He dismissed claims of international conspiracy behind the no-confidence move and said that parliament itself was all powerful to decide about the fate of its prime minister.
Khuhro said that certain PTI members were served with notices for merely not attending the party session and said they could not be disqualified before exercising their vote in favour of opposition’s move. 
He said the government had adopted the strategy to hold public meeting on the day of the no-trust vote to threaten their members with the presence of charged crowd before whom they would have to walk to the assembly and return. It spoke volumes that PTI was short of required numbers, he said.
About possible PPP-MQM alliance, Khuhro argued that PPP had forged alliance with the party in 1988 and 2008 as well and it made no difference if it did it again. However, PPP had reservations over MQM’s stand on integrity of Sindh and demand for new province, he said. 
Reservations over implementation on 40:60 formula in jobs and resources would be sorted out, he said and challenged ruling party to impose governor’s rule in Sindh. It was a mere ‘dream’ after the 18th Amendment, he said. 
He spoke about fissures in the PTI and claimed that currently there were four groups in the party while its allies had taken a clear stand over no-confidence motion. 
He said in a sarcastic tone it was all right when members were brought on planes in 2018 election, but the same were now being branded ‘turncoats’ and traitors’ when they were not ready to stand by Imran Khan.

“The alarming thing is that we have also recorded extreme and severe cases and in this category we have found that 28pc cases of depression have increased followed by 27pc in anxiety and 22pc in stress,” Dr Hasan said.
Despite being an engineering university, the institution was working in fields of neurosciences and neuropsychology, where the teams of researchers were exploring ‘neurological biomarkers’ of mental health, he added.
The part of the study, he said, also required that how all these biomarkers after being identified could be reversed.
Explaining neurological biomarkers, Dr Hasan, who is also the co-principal investigator at the Neuro Computation Lab, said: “Whenever we go through any psychological problem, it changes the brain patterns. There are regions in the brain. These regions have connections among them. After any psychological problem, these connections receive the impact. They may get stronger or in some cases weaker. Sometimes they disappear and sometimes new connections emerge. So basically we study these connections and analyse that they can be reversed.”
The experts believe once the research is compiled and becomes part of a global study, it would be a big achievement of Pakistani researchers, who are leading the exercise with international collaboration of the University of Glasgow, Stanford University, the Monash University Australia and the Denmark Technological University under the NCAI programme.
Vision 2025
The NCAI is the technological initiative of the federal government under its ‘Vision 2025’.
The centre is designed to become a leading hub of innovation, scientific research, knowledge transfer to the local economy, and training in the area of AI and its closely affiliated fields.
The aim of the centre is to facilitate researchers in the field of AI; help them establish and grow AI industry following international trends and seek solutions to the indigenous problems through AI.
Approved in January 2018, the NCAI is designed on a consortium model where the most leading researchers in the field of AI are identified on competitive grounds and new state-of-the-art laboratories are established under their supervision. 
As research on the mental health issues in the wake of post-pandemic scenario enters the final phase, it has raised the hopes of researchers and experts that it would go a long way both for medical science professionals and health scientists.
‘Replace traditional treatment’
“The technology has two roles when it comes to health sciences,” said Dr Saad Ahmed Qazi, dean of faculty of computer engineering at the NED University.
“One is about diagnostic, where it helps you finding timely and accurate health issues and problems. The other is about remedial action. In technology, there are several neuro-modulation techniques, which can be used for effective and durable treatment.”
He said the university’s study would help replace the traditional way of treatment in mental health and it would gradually make things easy both for the medical science professionals and people suffering from such conditions.
“In mental health issues we largely see the counselling as one of the key tools for treatment. So we can say that it [technology] gives you an opportunity to go a step forward from the conventional way of treatment and here we can capitalise on the benefits of the technology which ultimately benefits a common man,” said Dr Qazi.

2022-03-27,2022-03-21,PTI workers vow to stand with Imran come what may,"KARACHI: While the challenges faced by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government in the Centre are fast growing, the...","KARACHI: While the challenges faced by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government in the Centre are fast growing, the party’s Sindh chapter has expressed the resolve to stand by with Prime Minister Imran Khan against all odds and a large number of their workers and supporters will attend the March 27 rally being held on the call of the PTI chairman in Islamabad. 
The fresh determination was demonstrated in a rally in Laasi Goth, Malir on Sunday, where the participants vowed to continue their struggle for ‘Naya Pakistan’ and described the founder of their party as the only hope for a prosperous and corruption-free Pakistan. 
Leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh told the rally that PM Khan emerged as the leader of Ummah as he has raised the issue of Namoos-i-Risalat (PBUH) on all international forums and played a pivotal role in approval and passage of a historic resolution against Islamophobia in the United Nations.
He said he was the leader who had given Pakistan a sovereign and independent foreign policy by saying ‘absolutely not’ on a question of handing over air bases to a foreign power. 
The people of Sindh in a large numbers are ready to depart for the federal capital and caravans of over 1,000 vehicles are being prepared while a train is booked as well, he announced. 
“It is so unfortunate that Sindh House in Islamabad is being used for horse-trading, which creates a negative perception of Sindh across the country and caused embarrassment to the people of the province,” said Mr Sheikh. 
Protest at estranged MNA Kumar’s house 
Meanwhile, PTI workers staged a protest demonstration outside the residence of disgruntled party MNA Ramesh Kumar. 
Carrying placards and party flags, they chanted slogans and warned the MNA about public reaction against his decision to vote against PM Khan in the upcoming no-confidence resolution. 
Led by PTI MPAs Saeed Afridi, Shabbir Qureshi and Shahnawaz Jadoon, the PTI workers said they would welcome Mr Kumar back into the party folds if he reviewed his fresh decision.

Introducing Sherry as an experienced editor and politician, Bandial said she has done a great job of compiling, editing and publishing the collection of essays by 22 Pakistani women writers. 
Sherry, explaining the inspiration behind publishing the book, said the essays contextualize the place of women in the Pakistani settings, where they are struggling for space and identity. She said despite materialistic progress, women still needed to explain themselves. These explanations are about the available space and the space being sought, and about their identity. She said our societal values and family norms held back all women under the cover of narratives laced with modesty and loyalty. 
The moderator took the discussion to feminism, which challenges societal chains. 
Sherry said that to her, feminism is a way of life. “Yes, it’s a way of life, where instead of focusing on that how others think about you, feminism teaches how you think about other people.” 
She said feminism had redefined women. It gave a chance for women to be courageous and speak out on the matters that matter.  Sherry also differentiated between the first women’s activism exhibited during the Zia rule and the ongoing Aurat March. During the 80s, the women challenged state oppression, draconian laws and shrinking space for women. 
The Aurat March had no such challenges to take on. But the looming threat for Aurat March was extremists’ threats. She said Aurat March needed broader engagement to make it a march of the masses. It needs a ceaseless struggle. It needs women to explain to the detractors that ‘mera jism, meri marzi’ is about free will marriage, and about having choices regarding birth planning. She urged women, and civil society to get engaged with political parties for a broader change. 
The session, which otherwise was wonderful, faced technological constraints. 
ARE YOU ENJOYING?: Actress and short-story writer Mira Sethi’s debut story collection has only one purpose: she writes to see and to be seen. At the launch of her book, she with moderator actor Adnan Malik spoke about the characters and settings of her stories. She said the book was written in English to reach wider audiences, but the stories only represent localism.
Since she is not good at Urdu, she chose English to express herself. She had a disclaimer: English houses my intellect, but not my heart.
To keep the flavour of the characters and language original and local, she frequently uses desi words in her stories without explaining them. She said foreign publishers are always sceptical about non-western writers’ work and would ask them asked about the approach of their work. She said her fiction work only aimed at bringing out Pakistani culture to the world. Being a performing art person herself, Mira has several professional performers in her stories. She also spoke on the subjects of ongoing drama serials, saying that marriages, especially the bad marriages, were the ‘in’ things, but the trend would not produce strong women in our society.   
Mira is now celebrating the success of her debut work; she has no plan to bring out her second book right now. 
“Writing is an exhaustive work, so for now, I’m just concentrating on acting projects,” she said.

“At present, our inflows and outflows are equal, that means the water entering the reservoir is being released to provinces for irrigation purposes as per indent allocated by the Indus River System Authority (Irsa),” an official source told Dawn on Sunday.
“Till we cross the indent of 40,000-cusec outflows, which is now 24,300 cusecs on an average, storage can’t go up from the dam’s minimum operating level,” he clarified, adding that the situation would improve very soon, as the snow melting had already started. 
According to the daily report issued by the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), the minimum operating level in Tarbela is 1,392 feet, whereas the level recorded on Sunday was also the same (1,392 feet). The maximum conservation level of the reservoir is 1,550 feet, while the live storage recorded on Sunday was zero.  
The Mangla Dam, which has the minimum operating level of 1,050 feet, currently has 1082.25 feet level. The maximum conservation level was recorded 1,242 feet, while the live storage remained at 0.181MAF (million acre feet).

At the session moderated by senior journalist and TV anchor Mujahid Barelvi, Jan, also founder president of his Left-oriented Huqooq-i-Khalq movement, said his book opens with one of the the darkest episodes of Indian History, Jallianwala Bagh carnage occurred at Amritsar (now India) on 13th of April, 1919. On the day, British Indian army opened indiscriminate fire on peaceful protesters, killing, as per some accounts, up to 1,500 people, on the orders of Gen Dyer.  
Jan mentions that Gen Dyer ordered the massacre just to instill fear among the Indians so that they could never think of rising against the British rulers and that state was still using the tool of fear to subjugate people demanding their rights.
Sindh University Jamshoro Assistant Professor Amar Sindhu said Jan’s book presents the case of marginalised communities. She said the most damaging thing state has done is that it erased the nation’s memory of the atrocities committed against the people, including attempts to snatch their rights, and instilled fear and uncertainty in its collective consciousness.  
She regretted that the post-Zia generation was unaware of the state oppression because they just remember Musharraf regime. She said military dictator Gen Zia ruthlessly used fear as a tool to suppress dissent, and put its opponents in the torture cells in Lahore Fort. “Whenever a government of people would take charge, Lahore Fort would be converted into a ‘museum of torture’,” she added.
Peshawar-based human rights activist Shahida Shah referred to Dalton’s theory of structural violence to expound state’s employment of torture and other forms of violence to suppress people. She said for her activism was a natural option given the political and social conditions in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa where there was an atmosphere of fear and suffocation.  
To Mr Barelvi’s question that why Pakistan’s leftists could not so far make a united front to struggle for achieving their common objectives, Jan said the Left was systematically rendered disorganised because of conspiracies. He said a scattered fight was being fought by the leftists in various parts of the country, stressing the need for unity among various leftist factions. He said the situation was, however, improving as a younger generation of Punjabi leftists were supporting their comrades from other provinces like Balochistan. In this regard he mentioned support of Punjabi students of Punjab university for the Baloch students.  
Amar Sindhu was of the opinion that leftists should not have detached themselves from local and regional issues. She regretted that public domain had been left to the mullah (rigid religious people).

The Taliban came...,"People say that Pakistan created the Taliban but it’s wrong though we might take a credit for it. The Taliban came into existence through the truck mafia, said former foreign secretary Najmuddin A. Shaikh.  
“When they used to go to Kandahar, they had to pass eight to 10 checkpoints where they had to pay a fine. The truck mafia said to the seminary students and ordinary sepoys, who were not Taliban to give it a safe passage and requested them to provide it and they did that,” he said while speaking in a session, The Imperial Ghost Wars in Afghanistan on the concluding day of the Lahore Literary Festival (LLF) on Sunday. 
“Then we said, ‘the Taliban are our boys’ but the Taliban did not accept that and told that Naseerullah Babar had nothing to do with them.” 
Mr Shaikh added that Osama bin Laden went to Afghanistan in a C-31, which was only possible through the US government. “I was then the foreign secretary. I wrote to our intelligence agencies to keep a watch on him because his presence there was going to create problems for us.” 
He termed peace in Afghanistan essential for Pakistan because any disturbance there would multiply in Pakistan.  
Former ambassador to the US Maleeha Lodhi said that for Pakistan, the US was part of an external strategy to counter India’s threatening posture with Pakistan. She said the relationship has been very mercurial, problematic and turbulent and it was best when the both sides had common objectives like both sides wanted US withdrawal from Afghanistan, both sides wanted the dissemination of Al-Qaida.  
“We are in a transitional phase. It is hard to see how the new relationship is going to be redefined unless there is meaningful engagement at the senior level which I am not seeing so far. Perhaps the US has other issues now in mind vis-à-vis Ukraine.”  
Ms Lodhi said the relationship is going to be affected by three factors, the Sino-US confrontation, India factor as Pak-India relations are not normalised and the situation of Afghanistan where Pakistan wanted a greater engagement.  
Writer and journalist Zahid Hussain said US-Pakistan relations had gone through many phases in the last sixty years but a new alliance emerged after 9/11. “Before 9/11 happened, the US and Pakistan were pursuing different policies in Afghanistan but things changed after 9/11.” 
He said after the incident, Pakistan was important for the US to engage in Afghanistan as the mastermind of 9/11 was living there and Pakistan was deeply involved in Afghanistan before that.  
“There had been a lot of political statements by political leaders that ‘one call’ led to Pakistan’s alliance with the US which was completely wrong. Pakistan did not have a choice.” 
After the return of US forces from Afghanistan, the nature of relations had completely changed and they had gone back to the same situation that was before 9/11, he said. 
Zahid Hussain added that there had been a lot of talk that the US had betrayed Pakistan but one thing should be clear that nations make their relations based on their national interests.  
He said when Taliban ruled Afghanistan before 9/11, there were no Taliban fighting in Pakistan but now the TTP had emboldened, and its back in the former tribal areas of Pakistan which should be a concern for Pakistan.  
AKBAR ZAIDI: Political economist Akbar S. Zaidi talking about his book, Making of A Muslim, said many things told about Pakistan and the Muslims of 19th century were wrong. 
“I was intrigued by the idea how the idea of a Muslim is portrayed in history, social sciences by very prominent historians, including the one who was here yesterday but I can’t take the name.  
“There was a region in Hindustan where everything was written in Urdu and our historians, with some exceptions, don’t read Urdu despite writing extensive books.”  
Mr Zaidi said the crux of this book was to explore what were the Muslims talking about in the 19th century, adding that he read newspapers from that era, exploring the Khuda Bakhsh Library in Patna, Aligarh Library and British Library. 
He said contemporary historians claim that a Muslim nation came into being after 1857. “I refuse to accept it. There was nothing like it.” 
He declared there was no better word than Zillat (humiliation). “The book has many themes and there is one theme of Zillat.”  
The Urdu speaking elite realised that the condition they were in was utter Zillat.  
“People think that the sects of Islam, Deobandi, Barelvi and Ahle Hadith, had been there since centuries. In 1867, the Deoband sect started, the Barelvis came in 1895 and Ahle Hadith originated in 1870-1875. These sects are just infants compared to the 1,400 years long history of Islam.” 
Talking about his book again, Mr Zaidi said his argument was that due to the Zillat of 1857, Aligarh came into being, Sir Syed appeared, and all Muslim sects came into being. “In Aligarh of 19th century, Ghalib was not taught and you could not talk about Urdu poetry. Keats was taught. There were a Union club and English debating club,” he said.  
“Calling Sir Syed as an educationist is bullshit. Aligarh’s objective was getting jobs and not knowledge,” Mr Zaidi declared.

Mr Natiq remarked that poets have been there since the world was created, sharing that a poet can write aghazal, but everyghazalwriter can’t be a poet. He called himself a storyteller while writing poetry.
“A poet is someone who loiters aimlessly (awara gard); he talks to the trees, stars and what not. Everything in the world was created beautiful, it is us who have distorted them,” he reflected. 
The poet then talks about the use of istaara (metaphor), saying mushahida (observation) is the most important element in poetry. “Things change as we move from one location to another. So if you keep writing as you go along in life, it’ll appear fresh and attract many more readers. Poetry should make people happy; it should give them confidence about life.”
Natiq then read out some versesfrom the book under discussion.
When asked about a lot of focus on nature in his poetry, Natiq gave an example that no hotel anywhere in the world could beat lying on a charpoy under ajaamantree by a waterway with a book for company. “Nature provides a person a shadow; humans are bound for life with trees and poetry is all about love and care, which nature provides in abundance.”
The moderator asked him about his philosophy of life in terms of him having a strong voice against injustices. “If justice (adal) ends from the world, life will come to an end. The objective of poetry is to speak the truth, and if you don’t then you justify the injustice. There is no compromise on it. People make friends, but I’m known for making enemies because of opinions. History will only remember those who stand on the right side.”
Mr Natiq concluded by revealing he was working on his autobiography that will be “honest and interesting”.
Video games
Video game connoisseurs gathered to listen to art historian and ethnologist Jean-Baptiste Clais talk about his passion for the games, contemporary pop culture that he specialises in, how he put together an exhibition about video games and their connection with culture, cinema, and art.
At the start of the session, ‘Video Games as a New Domain of Creation’, moderated by digital storyteller/journalist Mariam Saeed Khan at Lahore Literary Festival, Mr Clais gave a presentation on the market shares of different video game systems, the evolution of graphics of video games and glimpses into the first video games exhibition.
Talking about the exhibition, he said since the game had to be visualised, simple colours had to be used to get public attention. “Games are inspired by the real world, includingmovies, cartoons and television, while video games also exert their influence on these media.”
When Ms Khan asked what his favourite video game was, he said there were none since as a child he wasn’t allowed to play them. “I bought a computer when I became an adult and started playing then only.”
The objective of a non-profit he volunteers for, he shared, is to maintain digital heritage, organise shows and exhibitions and display gaming machines to explain to people, especially parents, how they work.“There’s so much beauty and poetry and art out there and wonderful games.Video gaming can be shaped in so many contexts. You have to find an angle that makes it interesting. Museums are there for the community that thinks games are a part of them and their lives; they’ll cease to exist once people stop playing games.”

But he was able to connect to a doctor through Sehat Kahani and got prescribed the required medicine that helped save his life.”
With a ratio of one doctor for every 1,200 patients, half the population of Pakistan does not have access to basic primary healthcare services. Hand-in-hand is the phenomenon of doctor bahus: women who train medically but for a myriad of reasons are unable to practice in a country that desperately needs more doctors.
Born out of Dr Khurram’s personal experience, Sehat Kahani is a health tech social enterprise that provides a solution to both problems. “I was practicing when I had to shift cities. By chance, I connected to the nurse on duty at my old desk who told me patients were still coming to the clinic but no doctor was available. I started consulting on the phone and eventually got a webcam. Over time the chance encounter evolved into Sehat Kahani,” says Dr Khurram.
Operating through a network of 37 clinics, to date Sehat Kahani has offered 850,000 consultations and employs 7,000 doctors of which 85 per cent are females.

While various startups addresses a spectrum of challenges, till the net is cast wider and deeper, health tech will not be a panacea for all healthcare problems in Pakistan

According to the global health security index 2021, Pakistan is ranked 130 out of 195. From being able to access medical advice to the purchase of genuine medicine to recognising the presence of a disease, there are challenges across the entire process. Digitisation has stepped in to address many of the gaps of which Sehat Kahani is a case in point.
“We have saved six people from committing suicide in Pakistan,” says Syed Naseh, CTO of Saaya Health, a mental health platform. Available in seven languages globally and Urdu, Punjabi, Pashto and Sindhi in Pakistan, Saaya Health has conducted over 4,000 counselling sessions and its social-emotional learning content has reached about 100,000 children.
One in four people in Pakistan suffer from mental health issues. In Karachi, where multi-generational families live in small apartments, one in three suffer from depression and anxiety. And yet, there is a taboo around mental health with those seeking it as perceived to be ‘mad’, explains COO Alizeh Valjee who has a background in psychology.
During the pandemic, relationship issues were exacerbated, increasing domestic violence. The rate of disability and dysfunction increased in those with existing mental health issues along with burnout rates. Stress related to financial insecurities, rise in unemployment and poverty, lack of access to social support and recreational outlets, inability to access the health system during the lockdown and overall anxiety due to uncertainty together made an environment highly conducive to debilitating mental health and holistic wellbeing.
But things are improving, says Mr Naseh. Mental health is becoming less of a taboo, more literature is being produced and more universities are offering psychology cases, he said while giving the example of the recently held Karachi Wellness Festival.
However, all access to healthcare becomes meaningless if the medicines bought to address the illnesses are fake. And Pakistan’s problems with counterfeit drugs is endemic, with some research statistics indicating that 40-50pc of medicine sold are fake.
“We are trying to connect the pharma companies directly to the patient to help eliminate fake medicines from the system,” says Furquan Kidwai, founder and CEO of online pharmacy Dawaai.
There are 500-plus pharmaceutical companies in the country that are manufacturing drugs distributed by 1000-plus distributors through 45,000-plus licensed pharmacies, he explains using numbers to explain how fragmented the market is. This has resulted in the creation of many layers between the pharma company and the end consumer that has allowed one of the biggest counterfeit medicine markets in the world to flourish.
Because of the cryogenic nature of the market, there are about 20,000 unique SKUs (stock-taking units) available for about 500-600 medicines — each medicine is sold under 10-15 different names. “Take Paracetamol as an example. It is sold under 30 different names — Panadol, Paramol, Parasol etc,” he says.
An average shop has say about 200 SKUs so patients have to go through the hassle of visiting multiple pharmacies to get their prescription fulfilled. The pandemic pushed Dawaai’s user adoption rate to 5x-6x, leading to a current growth rate of 9x. 
The health tech numbers are impressive. One source says there are 331 health tech startups in Pakistan, another says telehealth companies grew by 900pc during the pandemic. But this picture is skewed. While various health tech addresses a spectrum of challenges, from menstrual health to setting up appointments with doctors, the ease of access is limited to the relatively affluent that have access to the internet and a basic understanding of technology. Till the net is cast wider and deeper, health tech will not be a panacea for all healthcare problems in Pakistan.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Looking towards the small guy,"There are more than 3,000 Pakistani sellers on Alibaba.com with close to 90pc of them coming from Sialkot","

Mr Song Song, Country Manager, Ali Baba

 
For as long as one can remember, Pakistan has been stuck in a perpetual cycle of boom and busts. Ask any minister, finance bro or stock analyst masquerading as an economist the recipe to break free from this and they will tell you increasing exports is the answer. That’s also something Commerce Advisor Abdul Razak Dawood has made a key priority since the first day. 
One such measure his ministry could claim credit for was getting Pakistan placed on the Amazon’s sellers’ list, which we were told would open new avenues for exports for local entrepreneurs. How many of those businesses, mostly used to business-to-business (B2B )contracts, would actually be able to position themselves in the direct-to-consumer (D2C) segment on arguably the most competitive marketplace on the planet was a different matter altogether. 

There are more than 3,000 Pakistani sellers on Alibaba.com with close to 90pc of them coming from Sialkot

Meanwhile, a few thousand businesses from the country had focused their energies eastward towards Alibaba.com. In fact, Pakistan now ranks the highest in terms of paid sellers on the world’s largest B2B e-commerce platform’s Global Business. Since 2017-18, the number of Pakistani sellers on the platform has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent, according to a presentation the company presented to a roundtable at the Board of Investment’s recent conference. 
“There are more than 3,000 Pakistani sellers on Alibaba.com with close to 90pc of them coming from Sialkot,” says Mr Song Song, the company’s country manager for Pakistan. And now he wants to expand the platform’s reach to traders and businesses in other cities, especially the export-oriented ones like Faisalabad and Gujranwala, in addition to Karachi and Lahore. For that purpose, he and his team have been increasing their outreach efforts through awareness sessions at the various chambers of commerce and industries. 
“Apparel is the most popular category among Pakistani sellers, followed by sports goods and surgical equipment given that the majority of our users are from Sialkot,” he shares. According to the ‘Digital B2B Outlook 2022 Pakistan’ published by Alibaba at the beginning of the year, 63pc of the sellers are in the apparel category while a total of 3.2 million listings have been made from the country so far. But how much does that translate into dollar terms? “Unfortunately even we don’t know the gross merchandise value of goods sold from the country on our platform,” Mr Song Song says. 
That’s strange, isn’t it? Maybe at first. As a B2B e-commerce platform facilitating cross-border trade across hundreds of geographies, Alibaba.com is used by many buyers and sellers for discovery and information before actually negotiating the deal between themselves. “Outside China, the US and Malaysia, the transactions still take place offline so it becomes difficult for us to estimate the worth of goods sold,” the executive explains. 
The reason behind that is, of course, the complicated nature of B2B payments which is made even more complex due to the cross-border nature of transactions. “It’s not like B2C where the average order value would be a few dollars. You are talking hundreds of thousands or even a million dollars per order which the current infrastructure doesn’t allow for in Pakistan. And payments are just one component of it; there’s also fulfilment, integration with customs authorities etc. That entire ecosystem needs to be built,” Mr Song Song says.  
In that case, who else to build the ecosystem other than Alibaba.com — the most successful B2B e-commerce platform? “It requires huge amounts of investments as well as time. In China, it took us around five years to develop it,” he says. Before the company embarks on such an ambitious plan, it first wants to create a local presence and create more awareness among the sellers. 
“We are going to set up a local entity for Alibaba.com, the first such for any of the companies of the Alibaba Group [excluding Daraz and Easypaisa as they were acquisitions], and build an on-ground team in Pakistan for functions like customer service, outreach and marketing by the end of the calendar year,” Mr SongSong shares. This is along with growing their channel partners — currently numbering 10 — who currently act as the e-commerce platform’s representatives in the country and help onboard new users and provide support to the existing ones.

2021-07-27,2022-03-21,Hasty growth in housing finance,The euphoric demand for housing finance and a liberal supply of loans remains subject to ground reality checks.,"Agriculture and housing loans — along with micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) finance — are vital for boosting economic activity. And, if banks start lending more to all the three sectors at the same time, that almost guarantees accelerated GDP growth in the short-to-medium term. 
Currently, though, banks are not wholesomely engaged in such an exercise. But the government and the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) are trying to promote just that. Policies introduced for accelerating housing loans offer an added advantage to the government — they make room for politically-motivated tax amnesty in the name of the documentation of the economy. The ongoing Naya Pakistan Housing Programme (NPHP) is no exception.
Regardless of the fact that this is opening yet another avenue under this programme for the whitening of tax-evaded money, housing loans being offered under NPHP are quite promising. Already, they have reactivated the real estate and building construction sector and continue to enliven demand for outputs of dozens of allied industries and services sub-sectors. Their impact on the overall economy (rebased to 2015-16) is already being felt and is sure to become more and more pronounced with the passage of time. That is if future governments let the programme continue in its current form and spirit.

The euphoric demand for housing finance and liberal supply of loans remains subject to ground reality checks after the expiry of the tax amnesty scheme 

Within seven months of this fiscal year (ie between July 2021 and Jan 2022), banks disbursed fresh consumers loans of Rs47.6 billion for the construction of buildings. In addition to this, they also disbursed Rs11.8bn loans to their employees for the same purpose.
Thus, overall lending for construction of buildings in the first seven months of this fiscal year totalled Rs59.4bn, the latest SBP stats reveal. During the same period of the last fiscal year, total lending for housing buildings was too small — Rs7.9bn for general consumers and Rs22bn for bank employees or a total of Rs29.9bn! 
The demand for housing finance remained strong right from the beginning of this fiscal year partly because builders were using tax-evaded money for launching new housing projects following extension in the tax amnesty scheme. Partly, higher economic growth in 2021-21 compared to that of 2019-20 also motivated people to take advantage of the Naya Pakistan Housing Programme made easier this year — and apply for housing loans. 
So, the volumes of housing finance offered so far could have been larger had banks been able to process loans applications a bit more speedily. The PTI government, challenged on all fronts and struggling for its survival, is pushing banks to their limits through the central bank to accelerate the disbursement of housing loans. So, one can hope that the volumes of fresh housing loans would grow even faster in near future, more so because the “no-question asked” status of the investment coming into this sector has been extended — once again — to the end of FY22 in June.

The overall lending for construction of buildings in the first seven months of this fiscal year totalled Rs59.4bn while during the same period last fiscal year, total lending for housing buildings was Rs7.9bn for general consumers and Rs22bn for bank employees or a total of Rs29.9bn

Growth in housing finance and underlying expansion in construction activities continue to fuel growth in allied sectors as well. During July-Dec 2021, manufacturing of iron and steel grew by 18.4 per cent, whereas in the same period of 2020 this sub-sector of large-scale manufacturing had contracted by 12.1pc, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics. 
Monthly cement production which was below 3.7 million tonnes in July 2021 gradually picked up and peaked at 4.48m tonnes in October before coming down to 4.3m tonnes and 4m tonnes in November and December respectively, due to a dramatic rise in the cost of production of coal-fired cement plants after skyrocketing of coal prices in international markets — and not due to slackness in demand. 
To meet the increasing demand for housing finance, and particularly to meet the demand for low-cost housing, the SBP has now eased prudential regulations of microfinance banks. “The changes made in the prudential regulations include additional guidance on property assessment, mortgage creation and risk management,” the central bank announced on March 16. By end of 2021, total lending already made in the housing sector stood at Rs20bn — the number of beneficiaries was 75,000, an SBP press release said.
Moving forward, accelerated disbursement of housing finance through microfinance banks can be expected to boost volumes of financing and enhance the number of loan takers. But whether microfinance loans for housing can actually lead to the construction of new low-cost housing units is doubtful. These loans are likely to end up for purchasing already constructed flats and one-unit residential units or for the renovation of existing houses and apartments. 
The current euphoric demand for housing finance from commercial banks and an equally liberal supply of housing loans remain subject to ground reality checks after the expiry of the tax amnesty scheme in June. If tax amnesty for investment in the housing sector is allowed to expire on time — and not extended any further — construction of new houses and apartments may come to a halt. But that perhaps doesn’t bother the government. 
Another worrisome aspect of the housing finance euphoria is that banks are offering housing loans to their employees, particularly senior executives, a bit too liberally. The central bank needs to watch mortgage finance to bank employees closely to ward off any possible development of banks-builders nexus. Powerful builders particularly those with strong links with politicians and the establishment have successfully circumvented banking and environmental laws in the past for the construction of prized projects both in Karachi and Islamabad. Some of them still continue to do this. 
While making more housing loans, banks must also focus on ensuring their sustainability in terms of market risks and the risk of defaults.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,The challenges of the electronic warehouse receipt system,"If run professionally and efficiently, it may reduce pressure on farmers to sell their produce in panic immediately ...","The resource-constraint smallholder farmers are unattractive candidates for credit from formal financial institutions, which tend to ignore them because of their often unpredictable, fragmented and unstructured agricultural activities.
The State Bank of Pakistan, like the central banks of many other developing countries, is introducing schemes to increase access of small farmers to the formal credit channels, saving them from exploitation by informal money lenders.
The SBP, in this respect, has recently launched the electronic warehouse receipt (EWR) system for maize crop in Kasur district, almost a year after the scheme was introduced for paddy crop in Hafizabad, another central Punjab district. The EWR enables the depositor, whether a producer or dealer, of an agriculture commodity to use it as collateral for obtaining bank loans or trade in commodity markets, if and when the system is linked with the commodities exchange as well.
If run professionally and efficiently, it may also reduce pressure on farmers to sell their produce in panic immediately after harvests when prices are normally low. Thus, it may ensure a better return to farmers for their financial and physical investment and also help stabilise market prices. The system may also reduce post-harvest losses as care of the stored commodity is handed over to certified warehouses equipped with the required facilities and expertise.

If run professionally and efficiently, it may reduce pressure on farmers to sell their produce in panic immediately after harvests when prices are normally low while allowing agriculture commodities to be used as collateral for bank loans

However, the insufficient number of certified warehouses complying with preservation norms, lack of awareness among farmers and their limited business skills, and no incentives for buyers to purchase commodities from the warehouses are identified as the stumbling blocks in the expansion of the system.
Afaq Tiwana, a progressive farmer, says the EWR may be beneficial for the community only if the SBP scheme includes a blueprint for bridging the infrastructure (warehouses and logistics) gap. “There is an acute shortage of certified warehouses and reliable logistic facilities that are required to run the system satisfactorily.” He advocates for incentivising the infrastructure building by assuring business for the owners of the storage units the whole year so that they are attracted to invest more and more in the sector.
For this purpose, he argues, the government needs to get out of the business of wheat, the biggest crop of the country. The government is the major player in the wheat market but does not utilise private warehouses depriving them of around six-month business, he says. A mix of wheat, rice and maize crops, etc will ensure the warehouses do business throughout the year because of their different seasons. Mr Tiwana says for food security the government may buy grain from the warehouses if and when required through bidding.
Ibad Khan, president of Guava Growers Association, endorses the views saying by opting for the private warehousing system the government may save non-development expenditures worth billions of rupees consumed by thousands of Food Department employees in the name of salaries and perks, operating costs of their vehicles and buildings, etc “without doing any good”.
“The (provincial) government may buy four million tonnes of wheat from the certified warehouses through the Pakistan Commodities Exchange and lift the grain when needed from there. It will equal a surplus of thousands of food department employees and thus save huge funds required for the functioning of the department, as well as the hassle of checking theft of the crop from its storages by unscrupulous staff.”
Mr Khan thinks the farm produce warehousing concept may gain currency provided the farming community is given proper awareness and the purpose is well served easily by engaging the Agriculture Department’s field staff. “If a farmer learns that by spending Rs50, for instance, as storage rent, his produce will earn Rs100 then he will automatically turn towards the EWR scheme. The extension wing of the Agriculture Department is in close proximity to the rural population and may help mobilise them for it.”
An attractive package to build high-quality warehouses can find 15 to 20 investors in each village ready to build the storage if provided information/guidance about the business scope and initial technical assistance in running the facilities until these become self-sufficient, he asserts.
While the functioning of the facility will benefit the farming community in many ways, Mr Tiwana says the prevailing farm produce trade system is built to make the rich richer. “At present 70 to 80 per cent of commodities are sold at harvesting time in the country. And thus, these fetch lower rates for the farmers. Large processors and the influential (textile, feed, flour millers, etc) have huge amounts of cash at hand and make these purchases knowing that the prices will shoot up within months. Besides value-addition through their mills, they also earn a big profit through commodities trade, robbing millions of farmers of the money that actually belongs to them.”
The EWR facility will save the poor farmers from panic selling as well as stabilise prices in the open market at harvesting time because an adequate quantity of the produce would have been deposited with the warehouses, freeing the market from surplus crops. This would ensure a better return even for those farmers who will be opting to sell their produce in the spot market, he adds.
Mr Khan stresses that the warehousing concept must be linked to the Commodities Exchange for the sake of the sustainability of the system and that the Exchange should be relocated to Punjab, the largest producer of agricultural products so that those involved in active farming have easy access to it. He laments that no farmer association was engaged by the SBP or any other government entity to seek their input for the scheme.
For Amer Hayat Bhandara, a progressive grower from Pakpattan, the EWR facility seems to be working only for those farmers and final buyers who are qualified customers of commercial banks. He points out that one of the most common problems of the farmer is informal debt: farmers take loans from people in the market with personal guarantees and with a condition that the crop will be sold through them.
Will the middlemen allow the farmer to go for the EWR, he questions? Suppose if farmers want to do so, then the debt of the middleman will be repaid through EWR, but how will the inputs like seeds, fertilisers, fuel and pesticides for the next crop be acquired?

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Business leaders and sleepless nights,It’s time to lie low as there is no chance of any clarity till the no-confidence move is over.,"


 
THE critical domains of the economy and foreign affairs have taken a back seat as the political leadership has been left to scramble for continuing in power. This seems to be rather dicey in a world that is trying to deal with fragile energy markets and food security in its Covid-battered existence, and global peace in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
In addition to tales of human sufferings, the war has disturbed global commodity markets, disrupted supply chains, hiked freight charges and posed challenges to the global financial system after the West slapped harsh sanctions on Russia and excluded it from the SWIFT system of money transfers. Experts and economists have predicted slower growth and an increase in inflation worldwide.   
Instead of strategising to deal with the evolving global challenges, Islamabad appears to be too busy to care. Global experts have included Pakistan amongst the more vulnerable nations where the impact of the fallout of war is expected to be severe owing to the resource-deficient country’s dependence on oil, gas and edible imports.

It’s time to lie low as there is no chance of any clarity till the no-confidence move is over

Just as the masses are doing, businesses are also watching closely the events unfolding at a bewildering pace under the full glare of the media spotlight. With the final outcome not quite certain, the whole saga is keeping business houses unnerved.
The common man is desperately waiting for the debilitating economic stress to ease off to the extent that it possibly can, while the business class is dreading a hostile reaction of the West to the hard stance of the government towards the US and Europe. The handshake images of Prime Minister Imran Khan and President Putin in Moscow on the day Russia launched its attack on Ukraine has already placed the country in an awkward position. 
Some like to project the current situation in Pakistan as the expected manifestation of civil unrest over inflation and job losses, while others link it to be the outcome of deeper structural imbalance. And then there are those who see the struggle rooted in efforts to uphold the supremacy of civilian leadership. 
Argumentative Pakistanis can debate the politics, but they all agree that the economy and its challenges have taken a back seat for now and things will be difficult irrespective of the final outcome of the no-confidence motion in parliament.
The leading lights of business class, when approached for a comment, were evasive. Afraid to land on the wrong side of the current or the future set of rulers, they shared their disappointment with the political class privately, saying it was frustrating to watch the politicians “stoop too low whenever tested”. 
A senior business leader commented” “Prime Minister Imran Khan and his confidants are inciting violence much like Trump did in the US. How can they not understand the consequences? If politicians fail to resist the temptation to take their conflict out of parliament it can make the country drift towards anarchy. Yes, we are worried for our businesses, but we are more concerned about the safety and security of our family and the future of this country.” 
Musadaq Zulqarnain, of Interloop fame, believed that “irrespective of the outcome of the vote in parliament or the movement on the streets, the economy is not in a good shape. It will get worse because of political turbulence which will be followed by popular measures to please the masses without fundamental corrections. 
“Pakistan needs a sustained growth of 7-8 per cent for several years, powered by an increase in exports if it wants to come out of its economic troubles. The only solution is a consensus document — the Charter of Economy — which must be vigorously followed irrespective of the party in power,” he said.
Nasser Hayat Magoon, former president of the Federation of Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), said the troubles had aggravated in the last couple of years. The budget, he thought, has failed to spark much interest among the legislators. In his opinion, it is influenced by “a select group of businessmen that encircles the leadership”. 
Sources in the Ministry of Finance told Dawn that the budget exercise initiated in January has been in progress at the routine pace. 
Pulling out his wish-list, Mr Magnoon said: “The FPCCI suggested simplification of taxation, which was promised but was resisted by the tax bureaucracy. We do not expect a business-friendly budget. The timing of the budget will be contingent on how the present chaotic political situation settles.” 
He said the private sector needs to communicate with political parties and sensitise them to the variety of problems that are being faced by businesses. He warned that street agitation in the current charged environment may have serious consequences. 
Mian Anjum Nisar, another business leader, lamented the lack of clarity in politics, while Majyd Aziz was critical of mismatched priorities of successive governments. 
Regardless of the concerns voiced by the business community, everybody realises that at least in the short term, there is no chance of any clarity till the no-confidence move is over.

2022-07-27,2022-03-21,Auto parts — setting a new record for imports,New entrants are rolling out vehicles with mere 5pc locally made parts which is insufficient to reduce foreign exchange burden.,"Pakistan’s import bill for completely and semi-knocked down (CKD/SKD) kits for cars imported by local assemblers has crossed one billion dollars in just eight months of 2021-22 which is significantly higher than the record high bill of $1.12 billion for the entire of FY21.
The 8MFY22 ended with $1.102bn as compared to $557 million in the same period last fiscal. 
The low levels of localisation by Chinese and Korean investors under Auto Policy 2016-2021 for five years as well as in the new models by existing assemblers have played a key role in boosting the import bill.
As per data of the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the new and old entrants brought CKD/SKD kits worth $4.987bn from 2016-2017 to July-February 2021-2022, thus nullifying claims of achieving higher localisation.
Sources said that the new entrants have started rolling out vehicles from their assembly lines with a mere five per cent locally made parts which is insufficient to reduce the burden on the foreign exchange. 

New entrants are rolling out vehicles with mere five per cent locally made parts which is insufficient to reduce the burden on the foreign exchange rate

Assemblers are now in top gear as the eight months of FY22 ended with a whooping sales jump of 57.5pc in cars to 149,813 units. They are also excited over huge bookings in hands whose delivery time ranges between three months to 11 months. Jeeps and pickups sales have also surged by 51.5pc in 8MFY22 to 28,437 units.
Huge demand for cars has led to a massive jump in CKD/SKD imports to $1.120bn in FY21 from $478mn in FY20, up by 134pc thanks to low-interest rates and attractive auto financing by the banks till the third quarter of 2021
However, curbs on auto financing from the last quarter of 2021, persistent increase in car prices and long delays in delivery appear to have not hurt the buyers’ sentiments in the last eight months, while buyers are also satisfied over the rising resale value of the vehicles owing to months’ long delivery timings, soaring prices and on-money for vehicles for immediate delivery. 
The import bill of CKD/SKD was $660m in FY17 which later swelled to $809m in FY18 and then remained at $818mn in FY19. The fiscal year 2019-2020 was a bad year for the entire country due to the flare-up in Covid-19 from March to June followed by the government’s decision to close down the industrial units in April 2020. As a result, the FY20 import bill of CKD/SKD was just $478m.
Stakeholders had been trumpeting 70pc localisation in Suzuki Mehran which ruled the roads for over 30 years without significant model change. After the end of the iconic Mehran journey in 2018, the claim of achieving higher localisation by stakeholders has now been confined to 55-60pc in various existing Japanese models and 35-45pc in new models. 
It seems that no serious efforts have been made by the existing Japanese assemblers in the old and new models to improve the utilisation levels  of locally made parts in vehicles.
A vendor, who asked not to be named, said the import bill of CKD/SKD would remain under pressure as the new entrants, who had approved their projects under the Auto Policy 2016-2021, would enjoy a honeymoon period for the next four to five years to keep rolling out vehicles with negligible local content. Besides, new models by the existing Japanese assemblers will also take time in improving local content in the vehicles.
He said vendors had asked the government not to allow vehicles’ assembly of higher engine power under tAuto Policy 2016-2021. The new entrants, instead of introducing small cars below 800cc, shifted their focus towards the assembly of high engine power sports utility vehicles (SUV) whose numbers are growing every day.
Chief Operating Officer, Balochistan Wheel Limited (BWL), Muhammad Irfan Ghani in a letter to the CEO Engineering Development Board (EDB) said the EDB is the custodian of the auto vending industry which encourages the localisation of auto parts.
The auto sector in Pakistan is now more than 50 years old but the assemblers have not done localisation seriously, he complained.
He said the pace of localisation of auto parts is too slow due to the discouraging attitudes and lengthy procedures adopted by the assemblers which form a monopoly for their foreign principals. They protect their own interests to use their CKD parts and have made localisation very  difficult. 
Mr Ghani said the country’s precious foreign exchange is being wasted due to non-localisation while many assemblers are not taking parts from the local vendors in some of their newly launched models.
The matter came up for discussion during the first meeting of the Auto Industry Development and Export Committee (AIDEC) held on March 8, 2022, which was attended by the auto stakeholders and officials of the relevant ministries. The AIDEC meeting had decided that the EDB would schedule a joint meeting between Baluchistan Wheels and Pak Suzuki to resolve the matter.
However, AIDEC committee members reiterated that the localisation of parts and components must be pursued in letter and spirit. 
Former Chairman Pakistan Association of Parts and Accessories Manufacturers (Paapam), Abdul Rahman Aizaz attributed the rising import bill of CKD to the massive revival in sales of cars and SUVs from the depressed sales scenario of 2019-2020.
Under Auto Policy 2016-2021, most of the new entrants have focused on manufacturing SUVs, which too has resulted in the higher value of CKD imports. He said that sales volumes of new entrants and old players have shown phenomenal growth due to improving economic indicators.
Since the new entrants under Auto Policy 2016-21 can avail the concession on import of CKD for five years, localisation of parts in such vehicles, especially of SUVs, is in the catching-up phase, he added.
Mr Aizaz said that the unprecedented surge in international prices of various resins and metals, rupee devaluation against the dollar and multiple times higher freight charges have further enhanced the landed cost of almost all raw materials.

2022-02-27,2022-03-21,Surviving tough times,"Regardless of who wins and who loses the no-trust motion, the government will not find it easy to handle the economy.","The rupee hit its lowest ever of over 180 to a dollar in the interbank market on the weekend as the shares market continues to decline. 
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) appears largely satisfied with the PTI government’s explanation of the Rs346 billion relief package announced late last month in an apparent attempt to appease the inflation-stricken households. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) kept the key policy rate unchanged at 9.75 per cent but its warning that it could advance the next Monetary Policy Committee meeting to raise the interest rates if need be has pushed cut-off yields in the last public sector debt auction.
The political instability in the wake of a no-confidence motion submitted by the opposition to oust the prime minister is forcing the government to take populist measures that it might not have if it weren’t facing the existential threat from the opposition political parties that have come together to push Imran Khan out of power in spite of their deep divisions. 

Regardless of who wins and who loses the no-trust motion, the government will not find it easy to handle the economy — many hard decisions will have to be made

No one expected the Kaptaan to go away without fighting till the last ball, but the last week’s events in Islamabad have spawned fears of violence. The storming of the Parliament Lodges, where the opposition lawmakers were housed by police commandos and counter-terrorism force was followed by the attack of the PTI workers on Sindh House in Islamabad. It happened after the opposition gave media access to the place to interview dissident parliamentarians of the ruling party. 
The ruling party’s insistence to gather a million people outside the parliament in the event of the vote on the no-confidence resolution and the threats being tossed around by the ministers has forced the opposition political parties to make their own plans to counter the move. Indeed, everyone expected the prime minister to fight back — but not in this way. 
The situation is fluid and may likely continue for several weeks to come, with its impact expected to reverberate for many months. Regardless of who wins and who loses the no-trust motion, the government will not find it easy to handle the economy. Many tough decisions will have to be made. If the opposition succeeds in de-seating the prime minister, it will have its work cut out for them. 
The first job would be to approach the IMF to release the next tranche to shore up foreign exchange reserves and take the pressure off the home currency. PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has already hinted at renegotiating the deal with the multilateral lender. It is not clear if the Washington-based fund would be more kind to the new government than the Imran Khan administration. 
The second job, the businessmen interviewed by telephone over the weekend say, for whoever — the PTI or the opposition parties — is in power after the vote on the motion would be to mend Pakistan’s relationship with the West, especially the United States. “That does not necessarily mean that we have to dial down our ties with China. Going to Russia when the Kremlin had planned to attack Ukraine was a big foreign policy mistake Imran Khan made. He could have called off the tour and stayed neutral. That would not have brought upon us such pressure from the European Union and the US, with which our relations are already facing problems due to the Taleban takeover of Kabul last summer,” a textile exporter argued. 
“Improvement in our ties with Washington and European capitals is crucial not only for securing some concessions from the IMF but also to get out of the grey list of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).”
A senior executive of a chemical company was of the view that once politics cool down Islamabad will have to reconsider its policy towards India. “If you think you can improve your relationship with the West and get off the FATF’s enhanced monitoring regime without making some kind of headway with New Delhi, you are totally mistaken. I have information that our present military leadership too is in favour of resuming ties with India,” he claimed.
However, there are others who feel that the top priority has to be given to the resolution of domestic political problems. “The settlement of the outstanding issues with the IMF and the western powers is important. But more important is to tackle our domestic problems first. I cannot say if the present government will be in power after a few days or not. But in my opinion, once this crisis is over, all the parties must sit together and develop a consensus on electoral reforms so that we can have political stability. I think that the government term of five years should be curtailed to four years. We are very impatient people and a kind of fatigue starts to take over us every three to four years. If we manage to clean up our political mess, we will be able to put back the economy on the rails and end our international isolation.”

2022-03-20,2022-03-21,"IMF seeks details of petrol, power subsidy funding",Finance minister makes it clear there are no more outstanding issues as the IMF only wants to ascertain sources of funding.,"


 
ISLAMABAD: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has sought copies of financial agreements with the provincial governments and other details from the federal government to confirm the financing of discounts on electricity and petroleum products announced by Prime Minister Imran Khan, Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin disclosed at a press conference on Sunday.
The talks with the IMF were earlier scheduled to conclude on Friday last but then “they [Fund staff] wanted to see agreements with the provinces to basically reassure we are not involved in aerial firing” on financing of PM’s relief package for petroleum prices, the minister said.
Mr Tarin made it clear that there were no more outstanding issues, as they only wanted to ascertain the sources of funding to cover the cost of reduction in electricity and petroleum products. They were assured the package would be covered through provincial shares and dividends of the state-owned entities, he said. “They said show us agreements with the provinces,” he remarked.
The federal government has signed rolling memorandums of understanding with the provinces to provide cash surplus every year to show lower consolidated fiscal deficit but are sometimes remain unhonoured when provinces also go into overdrafts.
“So there is no problem. We already have agreements that we will show them” when the two sides would meet again on Monday, the minister said, adding he would hold a final policy round up with the fund mission on Tuesday. 
The two sides will then finalise the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) amicably and take it to the executive board on a convenient date.
After initial compliance with the commitments made with the IMF in December 2021 to increase petroleum levy and power tariff, PM Khan reversed the progress by announcing Rs10 per litre reduction in petroleum products bringing down levy to zero besides a cut in electricity rates by Rs5 per unit instead of a schedule of increases agreed to with the IMF to address circular debt.
Up to 700,000-tonne wheat import
Responding to a question, Mr Tarin said all the provinces were part of the minimum wheat support price at Rs2,200 per 40 kg approved by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet last week — about 13 per cent higher than Rs1,950 of last year and showed confidence to exceed procurement target that was also set at 6.9 million tonnes last week.
He said the wheat production was then estimated to be 5pc to 6pc higher and may not require imports except 500,000 to 700,000 tonnes for strategic reserves. “I would like to increase strategic reserves from 1.8 million tonnes to two million tonnes, depending on international prices,” he said, adding he would not burn foreign exchange if international wheat prices remain higher.
In response to a question about former PML-N finance minister Miftah Ismail’s statement that the country could not launch international bonds as Pakistan’s bond yields had gone high due to economic policies and fundamentals, Mr Tarin said his statement would not change ground reality. This was not Pakistan specific but with entire developing countries including Turkey, Indonesia and others, he remarked.
Mr Tarin said financing was not an issue but the interest rates being offered were higher. He said he still had $4-5bn worth of offers from banks, but “why should I take expensive loans?” Mr Miftah should also recall they had left the government with just one-month import financing that now stood at $16.6bn – against average monthly imports of about $7bn in eight months, he added.
Responding to a question whether he would continue as finance minister in the next government if asked, Mr Tarin said he was a man of principles and would at no cost do that as he was a PTI senator. “I will remain finance minister if the PTI government stays, otherwise will go home. I am not a renegade,” he said.
He expressed the hope that 5pc economic growth rate was expected despite various headwinds this year, as some sectors were also showing robust growth including large-scale manufacturing, agriculture and exports. “This shows there is thrust in the economy and momentum is returning,” he said, adding that this did not mean there were no headwinds but policy adjustments would continue to absorb them.
“The welcome news is that the LSM has grown by 8.2pc in January against same month of last year and 4.2pc against December 2021,” he said, adding the LSM growth had slowed down in August and September 2021 but the trend had reversed. “Our economic growth momentum has picked up again as all agriculture crops are growing at 6 to 12 percent, and exports and services sectors are also growing at a high pace,” the minister pointed out.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,NA speaker summons no-trust session on 25th,"Government to file reference in SC today to end politics of ""sale and purchase"".","ISLAMABAD: In an apparent move to prolong the voting on a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan, National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser on Sunday summoned the session of the lower house of parliament on March 25, violating the Constitution under which he is bound to convene a session within 14 days after the submission of a requisition. 
Meanwhile, the government also took a significant decision under which it will file a reference in the Supreme Court on Monday (today), seeking “an opinion” of the apex court on two main points — whether the disqualification of a legislator is for life time and whether the dissident MNAs of any party can cast vote on a no-confidence resolution. 
The speaker, who under the Constitution was bound to call the NA session by March 21 [within 14 days after the opposition’s requisition], gave an excuse that since the three-day conference of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) would be held in the NA hall, there was no other place in the federal capital to convene the NA session. 
This is despite the fact that the capital offers alternative locations where such an event can be held such as the spacious Jinnah Convention Centre, Prime Minister Secretariat, Pak-China Centre, two five-star hotels, etc. 

Government to file reference in SC today to end politics of ‘sale and purchase’

The opposition lashed out at the speaker for his decision to hold the NA session on March 25, saying he had violated the Constitution to prolong the voting on no-trust motion. 
Sources in the government told Dawn that the decisions to hold the NA session on March 25 and filing of the reference in the Supreme Court were taken at a meeting presided over by Prime Minister Khan at his Banigala residence on Sunday. 
Speaker Asad Qaiser issued an order saying the [opposition’s] requisition was received on March 8 for summoning the National Assembly. Whereas, on Jan 21, 2022, a motion had been adopted by the NA to allow the exclusive use of NA chamber for the 48th session of the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers scheduled for March 22, 23 or any other date. 
He said the renovation work on the NA chamber and its lobbies had commenced on the requirement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the end of February 2022, which was under taken by the Capital Development Authority. 
The speaker said that after the receipt of [the opposition’s] requisition, the NA Secretariat requested the Senate Secretariat to provide chamber of the Senate for holding the NA session, but the latter pointed out that the Senate chamber was also not available for being under renovation. 
“Thereafter, the CDA chairman and deputy commissioner, Islamabad, were also approached to arrange and provide a suitable building for holding the session of the National Assembly outside the parliament building, at Islamabad. However, they have informed in writing that no suitable place is available at present in Islamabad for holding the NA session,” Mr Qaisar added. 
“In view of the aforementioned facts and circumstances, it is evident that no suitable place would be available for holding the session of the NA till March 24. Having no adequate option available whatsoever, for holding of the NA session before March 24, therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under clause (3) of Article 54 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, read with Article 254 of the Constitution, I hereby summon the session of the National Assembly on the first available date i.e. Friday, March 25 at 11.00am at the Parliament House, Islamabad,” the order said. 
Meanwhile, Planning and Development Minister Asad Umar said in a tweet that the government would file a reference in the Supreme Court that would end the politics of “sell and purchase” and diminish the influence of “easy money” and “influence in politics”. 



 
When contacted, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said the decision to file the reference was taken by the prime minister in a meeting on Sunday. “The basic reasons of filing the reference are — to know whether the disqualification of any legislators is for lifetime and that can PTI dissidents cast vote on the no-trust motion,” he added. 
A source said the NA speaker could call the session on March 21 to meet the constitutional requirement [within 14 days after the requisition] and adjourn the session for three days for the OIC conference and it could resume on March 24. 
According to Article 63 of the Constitution, the prime minister is given three days after the tabling of a no-trust motion, for preparation. However, the government is apparently trying to linger on the voting on the motion — first by an excuse of “lack of suitable place for the session till March 25” and then filing of the reference in the Supreme Court. 
The information minister said the government was only seeking an opinion of the apex court and it could be given by the court even on the first day of filing of the reference or the court could take more time it deemed appropriate. 
Asked why the NA session was not called on March 21, he said the NA hall was not available for the session due to the OIC summit.

2022-03-20,2022-03-21,Opposition calls for Asad Qaiser’s trial under Article 6,"PTI accused of running social media campaign against army; PML-Q wants PM to take notice of ""anti-Pakistan"" drive.","ISLAMABAD / LAHORE: Opposition parties on Sunday slammed National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser for not convening the assembly session within 14 days of its requisition to take up their no-confidence resolution against Prime Minister Imran Khan, demanding that he should be tried under Article 6 of the Constitution.
The opposition parties also lashed out at the PM for, what they called, using the religion card in an effort to save his government and accused his party of launching a ‘propaganda campaign’ through its social media team against the army over its ‘neutrality’.
Speaking at a news conference, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari expressed the hope that the Supreme Court would take notice of the violation of the Constitution by the speaker, proving that there was at least one institution in the country for the protection of the Constitution, democracy and right of the vote of the parliamentarians. 
Stating that the job of the SC was to protect and implement the Constitution, the PPP chairman hoped that the court “will not facilitate this government on its unconstitutional step” and that it would make a constitutional decision, not a political one. 

PTI accused of running social media campaign against army; PML-Q wants PM to take notice of ‘anti-Pakistan’ drive

“We appreciate how the SC sent a message of standing with the law and Constitution, even on a weekend,” he said in an apparent reference to the hearing of a petition of the Supreme Court Bar Association during which the court had reprimanded the government over the attack by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) activists on Sindh House. 
He said the SC was already hearing a petition that had not been filed by them, but the bar association. However, he said the court had issued notices to the political parties as well in the case and they would present their viewpoint before it. 
“This coward captain [the PM] is running away from the vote of no confidence. He is escaping to the extent that he has made the speaker abrogate the Constitution,” the PPP chairman observed. 
Mr Bhutto-Zardari lashed out at PM Khan for using Islam for party politics and asked him not to use the slogan of Madinah state. 
“You (the PM) are the foreign-sponsored and foreign-funded agent who has been planted in our system,” he said while criticising the government’s foreign policy. He alleged that the prime minister had been given the task to damage the country’s foreign policy and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and that he had done it “beautifully”. 
He accused Mr Khan of adopting the foreign policy of India, stating that there was no difference in the foreign policies of the two countries. 
Addressing a separate news conference, PML-N’s senior vice-president Shahid Khaqan Abbasi also accused the speaker and the premier of violating the Constitution and committing treason under Article 6 which, he said, was not a joke. He said if anyone would interfere in the democratic process of no-trust move, he would commit ‘treason’. 
PML-N secretary general Ahsan Iqbal alleged that Mr Khan was using religion card to cover up his “dirty politics and incompetence”. 
Earlier, in a statement, PML-N information secretary Marriyum Aurangzeb stated if the speaker failed to convene the NA session before March 22, he would be guilty of violating the Constitution that was be punishable under Article 6. 
Campaign against institutions
During the news conference, the PPP chairman also alleged that the PM and his social media team had launched a ‘propaganda campaign’ to ‘provoke’ an institution so that it could not remain ‘neutral’. 
“When a time has come when the media is talking about a neutral environment, Imran and his social media team are trying to spread the propaganda that institutions are not neutral, be it through provocation or creating a constitutional crisis,” he said.
“It is the responsibility of all of us to demand and try for every institution to work within its domain drawn by the law and Constitution, and to criticise when this does not happen. However, it is also our responsibility to oppose the prime minister, his social media team and its members who are provoking and targeting an institution under a conspiracy,” he added.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari said the prime minister had equated the term ‘neutral’ with animals and had still not apologised to the nation over it. “Our efforts have always been for neutrality. The PM, his social media team and ministers are making desperate attempts to tarnish neutrality. We condemn this,” he said without elaborating.
The PPP chairman, who had not named the institution during his press conference, later asked the Inter-Service Public Relations and the judiciary to take notice of the propaganda campaign by the PM, his social media team and the MNAs aimed at getting “the status of neutrality” changed.
Though Mr Bhutto-Zardari did not give any reference to the army when he talked about the allegation regarding the propaganda campaign against neutrality, the PML-Q and the PML-N came out more openly when they castigated the PTI government for hitting out at army and Inter-Service Intelligence by a party’s woman MNA and an important member of the PTI’s media team. 
A video clip with the audio of PTI MNA Kanwal Shauzeb shared from a twitter space “Current political situation” went viral on social media in which she could be heard apparently talking about military establishment. “They have nothing to do with performance and neither they want to manage the country. They had never done it in the past, then why will they do it now. Actually, they wanted to hijack the system and working on an agenda of minus-Imran Khan,” she said in the clip, adding that the real issue was that the premier was not allowing those sitting in “different institutions and all kinds of institutions to continue their loot and plunder” and “that’s why they are now having panic attacks”.
Since Saturday afternoon, an unusual debate has started on Twitter with a host of people, apparently the PTI supporters, trying to make the army leadership controversial by levelling all kinds of accusations. They were found accusing the army chief of trying to undermine the government and the present system. 
In response, several people also came out in support of the armed forces, blaming the present government of maligning the armed forces and its chief.
Reacting over the clip, PML-Q MNA Chaudhry Salik Hussain tweeted: “The PTI’s social media team and a woman MNA levelled false allegations on the Pakistan Army and the ISI, which are unacceptable and unbearable.” 
Mr Hussain demanded that the PM must take notice of this “dirty anti-Pakistan campaign, otherwise, the PML-Q knew well how to deal with the anti-Pakistan elements”.



 
Also, the official spokesman for PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif, Malik Ahmad Khan, tweeted that the PTI social media team would not be allowed to defame the Pakistan Army. “The state’s existence gets threatened when a state army’s central authority is compromised,” he said. 



 
“When a state will not respect the status of the institution of army, can a state survive?” he asked in a linked tweet. “The strong army is a guarantor of strong Pakistan,” the spokesman said, adding that every Pakistani was ready to sacrifice his life for country’s solidarity and progress.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Jahangir Tareen group sees their demands being met,A senior party leader in Punjab says the PM has agreed to remove CM Buzdar but wants the dissident group to wait for a while.,"LAHORE: Members of the dissident Jahangir Tareen group in the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) appear confident they will have their way after securing guarantees that the chief minister of Punjab will be removed from office.
Sources in the group told Dawn that Prime Minister Imran Khan had all but “agreed” to accept the demands of the dissident group, but has sought more time to remove Chief Minister Usman Buzdar in order to “avert the impression of being blackmailed”.
Shaken by a no-confidence motion against the premier, the PTI government is on a mission to mend ways with party dissidents. A senior delegation of government members met the Jahangir Tareen group and asked them to explain their concerns and demands in detail.
“The Tareen group remains adamant over the removal of Usman Buzdar and explained their concerns with regards to victimisation, lukewarm response from Chief Minister Office to their problems and the bureaucracy’s attitude towards their group members,” a source in the Tareen group told Dawn.
A senior party leader in Punjab told Dawn the prime minister had agreed to remove CM Buzdar but wanted the dissident group to wait for a while, because an immediate acceptance of the demand would be exploited by the opposition as if “Imran Khan has bowed down to dissidents’ blackmail”.
The PTI government had also conveyed that the new chief minister would be from PTI parliamentarians, the senior party leader said, adding that the Tareen group assured the government team that it did not want to leave the party until it would be compelled to do so.
Problems being resolved
Meanwhile, key Tareen group member Lala Tahir Randhawa said a government team led by cabinet minister Murad Raas had called on the group and agreed to resolve problems that could be addressed through the administration.
Since the government team had been given two days to resolve the parliamentarians’ issue, Mr Randhawa said a response had started to come, as deputy commissioners, district police officers and other government officials were calling all group members to address their problems.
He said that actions taken to victimise him and provincial minister Ajmal Cheema were also being undone. “The government team will return with its problems’ resolution report and the group will meet on Wednesday to take a final decision,” he added.
Mr Randhawa asserted that the group’s main demand was “minus-Buzdar” because the incumbent chief minister had ruined the governance system in the country. “Another large group of MPAs have also contacted the Tareen group and expressed support for its demand of removing Buzdar from Punjab’s chief ministership,” Mr Randhawa revealed.
Answering a question about PTI dissident and former senior minister Abdul Aleem Khan’s conduct with the group after visiting it at Jahangir Tareen’s residence, Mr Randhawa said Aleem Khan did come and a five-member committee was constituted — including Mr Randhawa, Nauman Langrial, Abdul Hayee Dasti and Ajmal Cheema — to coordinate with Aleem Khan. However, Aleem Khan did not call the committee and he alone met Sindh Governor Imran Ismail, who visited him on the instructions of the prime minister.
Sources said the government had conveyed to the Tareen group that CM Buzdar would be replaced by another senior leader within the party and four names have started doing the rounds in the PTI parliamentarians’ circle, including those of provincial minister Raja Yasir Humayun, Murad Raas, Mian Aslam Iqbal and Asif Nakai.
Tareen group members told Dawn that 13 of their 17 MPAs were elected as independents and later joined the party. “Even if the Tareen group decided to vote against PM Imran Khan in the centre and CM Buzdar in Punjab, the government would not be able to de-seat them because they were not elected on PTI tickets,” Mr Randhawa told Dawn.
Tareen ‘held party together’
Meanwhile, Jahangir Tareen’s spokesman Awn Chaudhry said some eight MNAs were standing with the group and take a decision about supporting or not supporting the government in the opposition’s no-confidence motion.
“I was personally disturbed when I saw that several MNAs stood against the party,” he said and added that it all happened because PM Khan pushed away Jahangir Tareen, who was actually keeping all MNAs intact with the party.
“Mr Tareen used to help the prime minister in difficult times and resolve party parliamentarians’ problems,” he said and asked whether the PTI should not hold the premier’s political aides accountable for all this mess.
Answering a question whether Jahangir Tareen could enter into any deal with the PML-N, he said he could not comment on his leader’s behalf. “Whatever Jahangir Tareen will decide, his whole group will go along his decision,” he asserted.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,RED ZONE FILES: All set for a collision course,Some govt officials have started to acknowledge in private that prospects of surviving this challenge from opposition are slim.,"Political entanglements may once again be headed to the courts. 
Speaker Asad Qaiser has summoned the crucial session of the National Assembly on Friday, March 25, which is three days longer than the Constitution has stipulated once the required number of parliamentarians have requisitioned a session. This order further complicates a situation that is fraught with danger and uncertainty. Here’s where things stand today and what they could portend in the coming days:

The PTI government is doing legal gymnastics with constitutional procedures, but there is no way around the vote of no-confidence against Prime Minister Imran Khan. The only way that the PM can retain his job is if the opposition fails to muster a strength of 172 in the lower house during the vote. Or if for some reason, the opposition withdraws the motion. There is no other way out for the PM and his cabinet. Legal experts say the speaker may attempt to delay the process and push the vote forward, and this may ultimately end up in courts, but the vote will need to take place one way or another. What matters is the numbers game. Everything else is a side show.
The courts may in fact become the battleground before the real battle on the floor of the National Assembly. If both the government and the opposition head to the Supreme Court with their petitions, the court may need to pronounce on the following: (i) if Article 63 of the constitution allows the party head to stop errant members of his party from voting on the confidence motion (ii) if the disqualification under Article 3 for members indulging in floor crossing can be a lifetime ban (iii) if the speaker can delay summoning of the National Assembly for more than the two-week limit spelt out in the Constitution and whether he can somehow delay the moving of the motion for the vote of no confidence. 
These issues will be addressed by the Supreme Court this week and a lot will depend on how long the SC takes to pronounce a decision. According to legal experts, if the SC reaffirms the obvious interpretation of the constitutional procedure for the vote of no-confidence, then the government will have no other option but to fight the numbers game, which it appears to be losing at this stage.
The planned rallies by the government and the opposition on Sunday, March 27, have added an explosive element to the volatile situation. Inside the Red Zone, there is a genuine fear that if these rallies are allowed to take place as scheduled, then there is a danger of violence breaking out. Now, imagine the real danger: when such violence ensues between a sitting government and its opponents, what does the police do? And if the police cannot handle such a scenario, the only option is what Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid has been referring to in his speeches: handing over security responsibility to the armed forces.
There is no need for the situation to deteriorate to such a level. But it is being dragged towards such an outcome by the government itself. What is otherwise a straightforward constitutional procedure is being weaponised by the use of mobs and threats. These in turn are being used to fuel a new narrative that focuses on accusations of horse-trading as a means to undermine a democratic process. What is being deliberately ignored is that such allegations need to be proved in a court of law for any action to be taken. They are handy for political sloganeering but cannot be used to counter what is purely a constitutional and legal process.
The government allies have stitched up their agreements with the opposition but according to Red Zone insiders, they will hold back formal announcements till after the OIC foreign ministers’ meeting. Despite the ups and downs of this week and the increase in political temperatures, the PML-Q, MQM and BAP are still locked into an understanding whose final details are being stitched up. One parliamentarian from the allied parties said their decision was intact as per the understanding reached.
One key challenge for the opposition is to keep its members safe, secure and available in Islamabad. This has led to daily congregations for dinners where the leaders keep an eye on their flock while also ensuring that none are under any pressure or facing threats. Opposition insiders say this is harder than it sounds as these elected members have a strong gravitational pull from their constituencies and yet cannot be allowed to disperse from Islamabad at a crucial time when every single vote counts.
While it is clear that the vote of no confidence will take place in a matter of days, there remain some uncertainties that are becoming a source of concern: (i) if PM Khan is on a collision course – as is evident from his speeches, including the one on Sunday – is there a way the system can be saved from instability without the opposition ceding space to him? (ii) Will the establishment be forced to intervene if matters start to spin out of control (iii) what will happen if the PM decides to use the ‘nuclear option’ of firing a senior official and appointing a new one in his place?
Some senior government officials have started to acknowledge in private that their prospects of surviving this challenge from the opposition are slim. They are now also admitting that the root cause of the dire situation they find themselves in today is the unnecessary and avoidable confrontation with the establishment. 
Yet they are now locked into a predicament that can only reinforce itself if the PTI government falls. The narrative being stitched together by the party leadership will likely further accentuate the source of the conflict and could trigger greater political instability.

The Red Zone is under stress. The coming ten days will determine if it can sustain it.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Cases of femicide rising sharply in Iraqi Kurdistan,11 women were killed in the first two months of this year...,"SULAIMANIYAH: A woman burned alive by her husband, others shot dead by a father or a teenage brother — bloody violence against women has spiked in northern Iraq’s Kurdish region.
The autonomous area, keen on projecting an image of a relative haven of stability and tolerance in war-battered Iraq, has seen a sharp rise in femicide, killings motivated by gender.
“In the past two months, there has been an increase in femicide compared to the previous year,” said Hiwa Karim Jwamir of the Kurdish General Directorate for Combating Violence Against Women.
In the first two months of 2022, 11 women were killed in autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan, most of them shot, said the official based in Sulaimaniyah.
Forty-five women were killed in 2021, up from 25 the previous year, said Jwamir.

11 women were killed in the first two months of this year

On a Friday before dawn, a 15-year-old teenager was fatally wounded by six bullets fired by her father in the village of Soran. The man told police his daughter “went out with two boys late at night”, according to a domestic violence unit which also records so-called “honour killings”.
Across Iraq, gender-based violence rose 125 per cent to over 22,000 cases between 2020 and 2021, says the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund, which has also pointed to “a worrisome increase in depression and suicide among women and girls”. Last December, a 16-year-old girl was disfigured with acid in Baghdad by an adult who wanted to marry her but had been rejected.
For years, activists have denounced violence against women and forced marriages in Iraq, which remains a conservative and patriarchal society.
“Cases of violence against women are on the rise,” said long-time Kurdistan activist Bahar Munzir, director of local group the People’s Development Organisation.
“Most of the women who are killed are victims of a family member.”
A few days before International Women’s Day on March 8, the body of a 20-year-old woman was found on the side of the road in Arbil, the capital of Kurdistan.
Maria Sami, the victim, was known on social networks for her feminist speeches.
The following day, on March 9, Kirkuk police announced the arrest of the killer, her 18-year-old brother.
While he was still on the run, he spoke by phone to a Kurdish television channel and tried to justify the killing by charging his sister had failed to obey the family. In February, mother-of-two Shinyar Huner Rafiq died in hospital, five days after being admitted with serious burns.
“Her husband had come home one evening in a state of intoxication,” Shinyar’s father, Huner Rafiq, told AFP.
“He doused her body in gasoline and set it on fire.” After the father reported the killing, police arrested the husband. “Before dying, Shinyar told us the facts,” said the bereaved father. “We recorded it, and we submitted the video to the investigators.”
Kurdistan’s prime minister Masrour Barzani denounced the “horrific case”, saying he was “deeply troubled” by the spate of violent attacks against women.
The government must impose “the heaviest possible penalty on perpetrators”, he said in a statement.
“There is no honour in honour killings. I’m determined to protect every woman, girl and child from abuse ... This scourge must end.”
In early February, Dohuk police said they had found the corpse of Doski Azad, a 23-year-old transgender woman who had been ostracised by family members.
An arrest warrant was issued to find the suspected murderer: the victim’s brother, who had in recent years been living in Europe.
He had called his family to inform them of his crime and of where the body was, according to police.
The murder was condemned by the UN mission in Iraq, and the consulates of Western countries in Arbil.
The news provoked a torrent of hatred online — against the victim, even though some voices defended minorities’ rights.
In June 2011, Kurdistan passed a law criminalising domestic violence and female genital mutilation.
The law, which threatens life in prison for “honour” crimes, was hailed by non-governmental groups as a major step forward. But the law’s enforcement is hampered by a climate of impunity and a common fear of speaking out.
“When a woman is killed, the procedures of the security services are not the same as when it’s a man, the trial is not the same,” said Munzir, the activist.
“Some cases don’t even make it to court. They are subject to tribal resolution between the man’s family and that of his wife, the victim.“

Body asked to assess transparency of bidding process, comparison of rent rates offered by the lease and accepted by the then CDA administration

The notification of the committee, which was issued on March 10, and is available with Dawn, tasked the committee to “identify officer involved in processing/leasing of land/structure of Monal Restaurant in the protected area of National Park in violation of the Act of 1997, Ordinance of 1960, Ordinance of 1966, Ordinance of 1979 and the regulations made under the respective statutes”.
According to the terms of reference (TORs), the committee has been given the task to identify factors behind construction of Monal Restaurant and other buildings in the protected area as it was in violation of various acts and ordinances.
The committee has been directed to “assess the transparency of bidding process for leasing of Monal to a private entity and comparison of rent rates offered by the lease and accepted by the then CDA administration with the then market prices for facilities of similar size and nature, identify/mention relevant provision of laws and regulations, infringed while allowing construction/lease of the Monal Resturant and to ascertain the loss/ damages to wildlife, flora and fauna and environmental changes in National Park due to said construction of the restaurant”.
While hearing a petition related to Monal Restaurant, the IHC in January this year had ordered the CDA and Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) to seal the building and start proceedings against other buildings that were operating in the national park in violation of rules.
Following the said orders, the CDA and ICT administration sealed the restaurant.
However, the Supreme Court on March 9, suspended the Jan 11 IHC judgement of sealing and taking over possession of the restaurant.
“The unsigned order of the IHC will remain suspended,” ordered a three-judge Supreme Court bench headed by Justice Ijazul Ahsan. Consequently, Monal Restaurant was de-sealed.
The court, which had taken up the appeal of Monal Group of Companies, pointed out why no action was taken against the other 13 restaurants situated in close proximity of Monal and why Monal was discriminated against only and on what basis, its possession was taken over without the certified copy of the high court.
The IHC had ordered the CDA and IWMB to take over forthwith the possession of the restaurant and seal its premises, subject to allowing its owner/management to take out their property. 
The CDA, after construction of the restaurant, had leased it out to a private firm for 15 years and the lease agreement expired last year. 
However, a few years before the expiry of agreement, the lessee started paying rent to the military, which stated that the land where Monal was constructed belonged to them in accordance with a notification issued in 1912.
IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah rejected the military ownership’s claim over the land and ordered recovery of all the rent paid by the Monal Restaurant management. 
The court had also asked the defence ministry to ensure that the amount received as rent was deposited in the exchequer.
“The claim of Remount, Veterinary and Farms Directorate of Pakistan Army, regarding 8,068 acres of land in the notified national park area is in 
violation of the Ordinance of 1979, read with the Ordinance of 1960, and the [Islamabad] Master Plan,” the IHC had declared.
The IHC chief justice had also directed civic agencies to seal the sprawling naval golf course located in the national park area and unless an environmentally-friendly use can be found for it, ordered its demolition within four weeks.
A senior CDA officer confirmed that the inquiry committee had been formed and added that the committee was yet to hold its first meeting.

The statement of traffic police stated that SSP Rai Mazhar proposed to the Capital Development Authority to make the highway signal free.
The project has saved Rs7.5 billion as instead of constructing overhead bridges, the corridor was made signal free by constructing protected U-turns. 
The data of the police showed that over 115,000 vehicles enter and leave from Islamabad Chowk to Zero Point. As they will travel on the signal-free corridor, it will save around 100,000 man hours of people.
On an average four people travel in a vehicle so if each vehicle saves 15 minutes the entire saving of time of four persons will be one hour, the statement said.
Chief Commissioner Islamabad Amer Ali Ahmed had appreciated the proposal of SSP traffic and directed immediate implementation of the proposal. 
Now the Srinagar Highway has been made signal free by constructing three protective U-turns that connected Islamabad and Rawalpindi with the new airport.
All foreign guests and dignitaries use this road while travelling to and from the airport.
The duration of the travel to Islamabad airport would reduce to half.
This will help solve traffic jam by 60 to 70pc while travelling time to Islamabad airport will also reduce considerably, the SSP (Traffic) said.

2022-03-20,2022-03-21,Islamabad sees decline in Covid-19 mortality rate,Fafen’s findings stress the need for continued vigilance,"ISLAMABAD: As vaccination against Covid-19 has surpassed the figure of 90pc in the federal capital, the city has seen a reduction in mortality rate.
According to data, only 133 cases were reported in the city during the last one week, with the positivity ratio remaining at 1pc. 
On the other hand, Rawalpindi reported five positive cases on Sunday.
In another development, the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) launched a report on Sunday that covered Pakistan’s Covid-19 response during January-February 2022.

Fafen’s findings stress the need for continued vigilance

During the last few weeks, the fifth wave of the pandemic has been losing severity in the country, which can be gauged from the fact that the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) has decided to lift all restrictions for fully-vaccinated people.
Talking to Dawn, District Health Officer Islamabad Dr Zaeem Zia said though the city had surpassed the figure of 90pc, in terms of complete vaccination, it should be considered around 95pc as a number of residents of the city were outside the country.
“The reduced mortality rate shows credibility of vaccination in the city. Despite the fact that Islamabad has a large number of medical tourism, the mortality rate is almost zero,” he added.
While sharing the weekly data, Dr Zia said in the last week of January, the city observed the highest positivity rate of 16.45pc which then gradually started to decline, reaching 1pc during the last week.
The data showed that on Sunday, the capital reported 21 Covid-19 patients and the infection rate of 1.32pc.
Meanwhile,five people tested positive in Rawalpindi district and four recovered during the last 24 hours.
According to the health authority’s data, the positivity ratio in the district was 0.56pc. A total of 892 samples were collected out of which results of 887 people came back negative.
There are 76 active patients in Rawalpindi district as of March 20, with three patients admitted to hospitals and 73 home isolated.
Two patients surfaced from the cantonment areas and one patient each from Kallar Syedan, Taxila and Islamabad. There is no patient on ventilator, however one is on oxygen and the other two are stable.
On the other hand, a report of the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) has observed varying healthcare capacities across regions and districts during the fifth wave of Covid-19 that remained a major challenge and key concern.
With the onset of Omicron variant in December last year, confirmed cases jumped to 133,839 in January – the highest since the start of the pandemic – while the number of recoveries was recorded at 38,366.
Compared to January, cases started to decline in February. The health authorities recorded 79,855 confirmed cases and 147,548 recoveries in the month.
Fafen’s findings of the third pandemic governance monitoring report, released on Sunday, reinforced the need for consistent and continued vigilance and the necessity of both medium and long-term structural and policy changes built on the lessons learnt.
Compared to the earlier waves, the report highlighted a broad two-pronged pandemic response to the fifth surge of Covid-19 that helped Pakistan withstand and manage the challenges relatively well.
The first aspect of the response comprised varying levels of restrictions and targeted measures in areas with high positivity ratio.
The second wave comprised a parallel push for increased vaccination and broadening the eligible population section to include the 12-16 age group. A remarkable increase of 30 million to the fully vaccinated column during the first two months of the ongoing year is a testament to the seriousness accorded to the effort, the report said. 
Despite a slow start, Pakistan’s vaccination drive gained significant momentum, reaching an average of one million doses per day by the end of last year.
Pakistan had administered 216.9 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine by the first week of March 2022. Approximately 100 million people were fully vaccinated (65pc of the vaccine eligible population and 44pc of the total estimated population), whereas around 127.5 million are ‘partially vaccinated’ as per the information provided by the NCOC website and their official twitter account.
As assessed in the report, had the Omicron variant been as severe as the earlier variants, it would have seriously tested the healthcare system — a factor that shall not be lost on policymakers responsible for responding to any new variant of Covid-19 or a completely new pandemic.
For instance, the availability of beds, ventilators and doctors within the observed districts showed that the healthcare system in Pakistan was still under-equipped — more so in some areas than others.
If the situation had necessitated the hospitalisation of those infected, the number of patients per ventilator and patients per bed would have resulted in severe consequences for some of the districts.
For instance, Karak district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa would have 21,132 and 1,023 patients per ventilator and bed respectively, followed by Mardan with 669 patients per ventilator and 324 patients per bed, and Rawalpindi with 204 patients per ventilator and four patients per bed.
The private sector has played a significant role in providing services and facilities that have contributed to the overall pandemic governance and response. However, there remains the need for more effective regulation, especially regarding the pricing of critical services.
However, what remains a key concern for the government is the issue of price regulation.
Attendants of patients interviewed at various health facilities highlighted the significant variance in test pricing. The respondents claimed to have paid prices ranging between Rs1,000 and Rs15,000 or more.

Talking to Dawn, the minister said a fully funded Annual Development Programme (ADP) of Rs1.4 billion was approved for the construction of the university campus. He said the project was the joint ownership of the city as locals contributed funds towards raising different buildings.
The foundation of UoC was laid by Prime Minister Imran Khan near Balkasar area two years ago, which is nearing completion, Mr Sarfraz said.
The request for establishment of the city campus was also submitted to the Punjab government so that students of Chakwal city did not travel 16km to Balkasar daily, he said.
The PC-I for the city campus has been approved and Rs1.4 billion allocated for the construction of the campus, the minister said.
“Two academic blocks, an admin block and male and female hostels would be built and renovation carried out with the fund,” the provincial minister said, adding that construction of the city campus would be completed by 2024.
“The Ministry of Higher Education was my favourite portfolio that has played a constructive role in the establishment of a public university in Chakwal. The engineering campus of the university in Balkasar is under construction and is expected to finish by the next year,” Mr Sarfraz said.
“Campuses of the university would be spread in different areas of Chakwal including Chakwal city, Balkasar and Murid. Land is being acquired in Murid area of Chakwal for construction of several facilities. The vision for this university is to have 30,000-40,000 students and to be an exemplary university of the Rawalpindi Division,” he said, adding that there was no major public university in the division like Lahore, Multan and Faisalabad.
He said: “Many intelligent female students from different areas of Chakwal were deprived of higher education as they were not allowed to get admissions in far-off cities. Now, those students would benefit the most as they can get higher education near their homes. To further create educational facilities for female students who cannot study in co-educational institutions due to conservative backgrounds, female government colleges in Chakwal and Talagang have been affiliated with the UoC and upgraded for BS programmes.”

In a letter to City Police Officer (CPO) Omer Saeed Malik, the provincial committee expressed its concern over the menace of celebratory firing and suggested that strict action needed to be taken by the police.
In its recent meeting, the committee discussed preventive measures related to March 23, 2022, when an increased number of aircraft will be flying from different Pakistan Air Force (PAF) bases. Safe flying operations during the fly past are of utmost importance, the members emphasised.

Provincial committee had expressed concern over the menace, suggested strict police action

It was also recommended that the authorities concerned conduct regular surveys and take swift action against all garbage dumps and place a strict ban on wasting food and other similar items, especially within 12 to 15 kilometres around airfields and airports.
Bird control is the responsibility of the airport management since bird shooters are deployed in the area, particularly near runways, and other preventative steps usually need to be taken to avoid any mishap.
“Since celebratory firing has become a real menace to the security of airspace, strict action has to be taken against it,” the committee stated, adding that a survey of marriage halls should be conducted and it should be made sure that there is no celebratory fire in the wake of important events taking place at the venue of the March 23 fly past and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) council of foreign ministers conference.
The CPO Rawalpindi was also asked to take strict action against firing in the air and to submit a report to the office of commissioner Rawalpindi on a fortnightly basis.
The Punjab government had already asked law enforcement agencies to execute Section 144 and devise a strategy to implement a policy on pigeon homing, kite flying, use of laser lights and drones near airbases and airports.
Following the increasing trend of kite flying, the PBHCC had been formed in March 2020 which had held its first meeting under the chair of the chief secretary of Punjab in Lahore.
Besides monitoring celebratory firing, the district police have been taking strict action against kite flyers and have seized a number of kites and arrested many sellers during ongoing crackdown.
When asked about the security level put in place in the city regarding defence day, the CPO said: “The security has been placed at red-alert level, though there has been no specific threat but we are not taking it lightly as doing all possible security measures, including conducting search operations, specifically in border areas.”
All the stake holders had been intimated by the committee to nominate their representatives for the other committee so that effective measures should be taken to prevent celebratory firing.

He said his party had told workers and supporters to get ready for the power show in Islamabad on March 27 and protect the parliamentarians from PTI’s goons.
The meeting decided that women workers would provide protection to the party’s women lawmakers and youth wing to the party’s leadership on March 27.
It also asked the party’s supporters to bring at least 200 people from each union council.
All union council chairmen will lead their separate rallies and join the main rally led by Hanif Abbasi and Sardar Naseem in the city and Malik Abrar and Daniyal Chaudhry in the cantonment areas.

“All party workers and supporters will go to Islamabad in the shape of rallies led by former MNA Hanif Abbasi, former MPAs Raja Hanif, Ziaullah Shah and others. Women wing, youth wing, student federation and minority and labour wings will bring their separate rallies,” Mr Naseem said.
He said the PML-N had finalised the plan to counter arrest and if the interior ministry tried to sabotage their peaceful rally, party workers from every street and area of the garrison city would foil its attempt.
“Rawalpindi is the fort of the PML-N which can be seen from the results of the local government elections in the cantonment areas from where not a single PTI member got elected,” he added.
He said in the last three years, the PTI government had done nothing for the residents of Rawalpindi and now Imran Khan had threatened to bring people to Islamabad.

This was revealed by Pattan, an NGO that works for democracy, human rights and gender equality in a report released here on Sunday.
It said reserved seats remained vacant or being won without any contest, a phenomenon that had also been seen in the first phase of the polls.
According to Pattan, lack of political will appears to be mainly responsible for low rate of female participation in local elections.
The second phase of local election shows that on an average only 1.76 female candidates are in the field against one seat, while seat to candidate ratio on other categories of seats is much high. For instance, on average there are 10 candidates against one seat for chairmen/mayor category.
Pattan argues that prior conditions (female literacy rate, human development level, women’s participation in labour force and access to public life, etc.,) appear to have played a major role in determining the level of women’s participation in the election.
Because of the existing differentiation, women’s participation as candidates varies from district to district. For instance, in Lower and Upper Kohistan – extremely poor and underdeveloped districts --about 90pc women seats remained vacant. 
In Battagram, out of total 90 female seats as many as 71 or 79pc remained vacant.
In South Waziristan too, more than 68pc of female seats remained vacant, while in Abbottabad, only 32 or 15pc of the 209 seats are vacant. 
In Upper Chitral, female candidates did not leave a single seat vacant.
However, there appears significant variations across districts. 
For instance, share of religious parties is higher than liberal parties in six districts - Mansehra 16pc, North Waziristan 36pc and Kurram 36pc, and Orakzai 32%. The liberal parties have clear edge over religious parties in eight districts - Upper Chitral 33pc, Lower Dir 49pc, Malakand 44pc, Shangla 43pc, Swat 50pc and Upper Dir 57pc. 
In 11 districts the independent candidates constitute clear majority in comparison to combined strength of all parties. 
In Abbottabad 88pc, Battagram 94pc, Upper Chitral 56pc, Lower Chitral 64pc, Mansehra 84pc, North Waziristan 53pc, South Waziristan 81pc, Orakzai 56pc, and Shangla 50pc.
Analysis of the contestation data (ECP Form X List of Contesting Candidates) also reveals some interesting socio-political trends:
1) High participation of female candidates even in the conservative or traditional districts than the combined female candidates of political parties is a clear sign of emergence of new social forces that are ready to play an important role in local governance.
2) Political parties appear to be ignorant of their emergence and have little appetite to broaden and deepen democracy and to avail this opportunity.
3) Political parties seem to be more interested in top positions i.e. mayors and chairpersons than in the quota seats of the marginalised sections of the society.
4) As a large number of women seats will remain vacant even after by-election female populations of many Neighborhood and Village Councils of KPK are likely to be deprived of women representatives.
Pattan’s analysis is primarily based on the ECP’s Form X (list of contesting candidates) of 17 districts.
The Pattan in it’s recommendations said the ECP should make available data and forms of every election promptly.
It said political parties need to invest resources to set up party chapters at grassroots level and must also hold internal party election and ECP should monitor their polling processes.
It also said civil society, women groups and trade unions should plan to field candidates against quota seats.

2022-03-20,2022-03-21,Moot on patient safety calls for moving towards medical home care,PM’s aide Dr Sultan says 20pc to 40pc of health spending wasted due to poor quality care...,"KARACHI: The 5th international conference on patient safety concluded at the Liaquat National Hospital (LNH) on Sunday with messages for moving towards people-centred care and increased use of technology to tackle growing healthcare challenges and burden on hospitals.
The event —Implementation research in healthcare quality and safety — was organised by Riphah Institute of Healthcare Improvement & Safety in partnership with World Health Organisation, Imperial College London, City University London, National Institute of Health, Islamabad and Martin Dow Group.
The conference covered topics ranging from infection prevention and control, patient safety in dentistry, role of nursing, implementation of health policies and research, to leadership in healthcare, pharmacovigilance and the role of virtual reality in surgical training.
In his recorded message, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health Dr Faisal Sultan explained why it’s important to focus on patient safety. “This is a serious health issue requiring our immediate attention. Better safety measures improve patient experience, health outcomes, well-being of the healthcare team as well as reduce costs,” he said.

PM’s aide Dr Sultan says 20pc to 40pc of health spending wasted due to poor quality care

Globally, Dr Sultan pointed out, 20 per cent to 40pc of health spending went wasted due to poor quality care and 15pc of hospital costs were on account of harm caused to patients.
“These statistics remind us that patient safety is critical in healthcare. In Pakistan, we need to move towards people-centred care, while paying attention to public health needs and expectations of the community to improve patient safety.”
He appreciated efforts on part of the event organisers and said discussions on the forum would encourage stakeholders to take practical measures in this field.
AI transforming healthcare future
In a session on the future of healthcare, LNH medical director Dr Salman Faridi said artificial intelligence was transforming the future of healthcare as it provided several advantages over traditional clinical decision-making.
On medical error reduction and prevention, he said chances of errors during treatment always existed and like other professionals, doctors should also be forgiven for the error.
In his presentation, Dr Zakiuddin said there was an immediate need to introduce the concept of ‘homspital’ in society where patients were provided healthcare services at home.
“There are several factors in play leading to the emergence of a new hospital structure. These forces include changes in patient population and their needs, advances in clinical knowledge and technology, impact of digital technology, higher patient expectation, difficulties in attracting and retaining an appropriate skilled workforce, financial and funding challenges and growing requirements to measure quality.”
Sharing some data on digital medical / health applications, he said their numbers were increasing rapidly. “Currently, we have 300,000 apps on iOS and Android compared to the approximately 165,000 available in 2015.”
Dr Zakiuddin concluded his presentation by emphasising that doctors and nurses were facing burnouts and to prevent them, the phenomenon of ‘homspital’ should be introduced as soon as possible.
Sindh Health Minister Azra Fazal Pechuho, Prof Paul Barach of Wayne State University, Dr Aziz Sheikh from the University of Edinburgh and Prof Allen Meador from the University of North Carolina, were among the speakers.

Khuhro said at a press conference at Larkana Press Club on Sunday that speaker of National Assembly had acted unconstitutionally by convening session on March 25. 
The opposition had submitted requisition on March 8 after which he was to convene the session within 14 days but if voting on no-confidence motion was not carried out on the date and attempt was made to impose governor’s rule in Sindh, it would prove disastrous, he warned. 
He said the speaker could not prorogue the session without going ahead with no-trust motion the day the session was convened. By holding the session late, the prime minister had attempted to make the speaker a scapegoat, he said. 
He dismissed claims of international conspiracy behind the no-confidence move and said that parliament itself was all powerful to decide about the fate of its prime minister.
Khuhro said that certain PTI members were served with notices for merely not attending the party session and said they could not be disqualified before exercising their vote in favour of opposition’s move. 
He said the government had adopted the strategy to hold public meeting on the day of the no-trust vote to threaten their members with the presence of charged crowd before whom they would have to walk to the assembly and return. It spoke volumes that PTI was short of required numbers, he said.
About possible PPP-MQM alliance, Khuhro argued that PPP had forged alliance with the party in 1988 and 2008 as well and it made no difference if it did it again. However, PPP had reservations over MQM’s stand on integrity of Sindh and demand for new province, he said. 
Reservations over implementation on 40:60 formula in jobs and resources would be sorted out, he said and challenged ruling party to impose governor’s rule in Sindh. It was a mere ‘dream’ after the 18th Amendment, he said. 
He spoke about fissures in the PTI and claimed that currently there were four groups in the party while its allies had taken a clear stand over no-confidence motion. 
He said in a sarcastic tone it was all right when members were brought on planes in 2018 election, but the same were now being branded ‘turncoats’ and traitors’ when they were not ready to stand by Imran Khan.

Malir SSP Irfan Bahadur said that Constable Faisal alias Nadeem lived near Daud Chowrangi and when he reached home after finishing his duty his neighbour Ahmed informed him that his father, Majeed Hameed, had been threatening neighbours with a pistol and asked him to try and talk some sense into his father along with him. 
The SSP said that as soon as the policeman, who was in uniform, unlocked the door Majeed fired at him indiscriminately. He suffered six to seven bullet wounds and was rushed to a hospital in critical condition.
In the meantime, Sharafi Goth SHO Adeel Ahmed along with a police team rushed to the scene after receiving information and tried to arrest Majeed, but he also fired at them causing bullet injuries to the SHO and policeman Yasir.
According to SSP Bahadur, who also reached the scene, police made two attempts to enter the house and finally they entered and evacuated other family members from the house. During an exchange of gunfire Majeed was shot and killed, he added.

2018-01-27,2022-03-21,"Depression, stress on the rise among Karachi youth, say researchers","Study conducted by NED University’s AI lab on 3,000 individuals will help treat mental issues, experts say.","KARACHI: A latest scientific study, which is part of a world-level publication, has found that levels of depression, anxiety and stress are growing mainly among the young population of Karachi.
The impact of Covid-19 pandemic has further worsened the psychological situation as in some cases the number of people suffering from such conditions has increased by 40 per cent.
The facts emerged in the data collected through a scientific research being conducted by the NED University of Engineering and Technology that had studied more than 3,000 individuals at its Neurocomputation Lab, which is one of the nine facilities set up under the National Centre of Artificial Intelligence (NCAI).
The study, experts believe, would help devise new modified strategies on diagnosis and treatment of mental health issues.
“We carried out the study on 3,000 individuals,” said Dr Muhammad Abul Hasan, associate professor at the biomedical engineering department of NED University.

Study conducted by NED University’s AI lab on 3,000 individuals will help treat mental issues

He said: “In post-Covid scenario we have found that issues of anxiety and stress have increased between 35pc to 40pc after the pandemic hit the country. This increase of percentage has been found among those who are suffering from mild and moderate psychological issues. 
“The alarming thing is that we have also recorded extreme and severe cases and in this category we have found that 28pc cases of depression have increased followed by 27pc in anxiety and 22pc in stress,” Dr Hasan said.
Despite being an engineering university, the institution was working in fields of neurosciences and neuropsychology, where the teams of researchers were exploring ‘neurological biomarkers’ of mental health, he added.
The part of the study, he said, also required that how all these biomarkers after being identified could be reversed.
Explaining neurological biomarkers, Dr Hasan, who is also the co-principal investigator at the Neuro Computation Lab, said: “Whenever we go through any psychological problem, it changes the brain patterns. There are regions in the brain. These regions have connections among them. After any psychological problem, these connections receive the impact. They may get stronger or in some cases weaker. Sometimes they disappear and sometimes new connections emerge. So basically we study these connections and analyse that they can be reversed.”
The experts believe once the research is compiled and becomes part of a global study, it would be a big achievement of Pakistani researchers, who are leading the exercise with international collaboration of the University of Glasgow, Stanford University, the Monash University Australia and the Denmark Technological University under the NCAI programme.
Vision 2025
The NCAI is the technological initiative of the federal government under its ‘Vision 2025’.
The centre is designed to become a leading hub of innovation, scientific research, knowledge transfer to the local economy, and training in the area of AI and its closely affiliated fields.
The aim of the centre is to facilitate researchers in the field of AI; help them establish and grow AI industry following international trends and seek solutions to the indigenous problems through AI.
Approved in January 2018, the NCAI is designed on a consortium model where the most leading researchers in the field of AI are identified on competitive grounds and new state-of-the-art laboratories are established under their supervision. 
As research on the mental health issues in the wake of post-pandemic scenario enters the final phase, it has raised the hopes of researchers and experts that it would go a long way both for medical science professionals and health scientists.
‘Replace traditional treatment’
“The technology has two roles when it comes to health sciences,” said Dr Saad Ahmed Qazi, dean of faculty of computer engineering at the NED University.
“One is about diagnostic, where it helps you finding timely and accurate health issues and problems. The other is about remedial action. In technology, there are several neuro-modulation techniques, which can be used for effective and durable treatment.”
He said the university’s study would help replace the traditional way of treatment in mental health and it would gradually make things easy both for the medical science professionals and people suffering from such conditions.
“In mental health issues we largely see the counselling as one of the key tools for treatment. So we can say that it [technology] gives you an opportunity to go a step forward from the conventional way of treatment and here we can capitalise on the benefits of the technology which ultimately benefits a common man,” said Dr Qazi.

The fresh determination was demonstrated in a rally in Laasi Goth, Malir on Sunday, where the participants vowed to continue their struggle for ‘Naya Pakistan’ and described the founder of their party as the only hope for a prosperous and corruption-free Pakistan. 
Leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh told the rally that PM Khan emerged as the leader of Ummah as he has raised the issue of Namoos-i-Risalat (PBUH) on all international forums and played a pivotal role in approval and passage of a historic resolution against Islamophobia in the United Nations.
He said he was the leader who had given Pakistan a sovereign and independent foreign policy by saying ‘absolutely not’ on a question of handing over air bases to a foreign power. 
The people of Sindh in a large numbers are ready to depart for the federal capital and caravans of over 1,000 vehicles are being prepared while a train is booked as well, he announced. 
“It is so unfortunate that Sindh House in Islamabad is being used for horse-trading, which creates a negative perception of Sindh across the country and caused embarrassment to the people of the province,” said Mr Sheikh. 
Protest at estranged MNA Kumar’s house 
Meanwhile, PTI workers staged a protest demonstration outside the residence of disgruntled party MNA Ramesh Kumar. 
Carrying placards and party flags, they chanted slogans and warned the MNA about public reaction against his decision to vote against PM Khan in the upcoming no-confidence resolution.

Introducing Sherry as an experienced editor and politician, Bandial said she has done a great job of compiling, editing and publishing the collection of essays by 22 Pakistani women writers. 
Sherry, explaining the inspiration behind publishing the book, said the essays contextualize the place of women in the Pakistani settings, where they are struggling for space and identity. She said despite materialistic progress, women still needed to explain themselves. These explanations are about the available space and the space being sought, and about their identity. She said our societal values and family norms held back all women under the cover of narratives laced with modesty and loyalty. 
The moderator took the discussion to feminism, which challenges societal chains. 
Sherry said that to her, feminism is a way of life. “Yes, it’s a way of life, where instead of focusing on that how others think about you, feminism teaches how you think about other people.” 
She said feminism had redefined women. It gave a chance for women to be courageous and speak out on the matters that matter.  Sherry also differentiated between the first women’s activism exhibited during the Zia rule and the ongoing Aurat March. During the 80s, the women challenged state oppression, draconian laws and shrinking space for women. 
The Aurat March had no such challenges to take on. But the looming threat for Aurat March was extremists’ threats. She said Aurat March needed broader engagement to make it a march of the masses. It needs a ceaseless struggle. It needs women to explain to the detractors that ‘mera jism, meri marzi’ is about free will marriage, and about having choices regarding birth planning. She urged women, and civil society to get engaged with political parties for a broader change. 
The session, which otherwise was wonderful, faced technological constraints. 
ARE YOU ENJOYING?: Actress and short-story writer Mira Sethi’s debut story collection has only one purpose: she writes to see and to be seen. At the launch of her book, she with moderator actor Adnan Malik spoke about the characters and settings of her stories. She said the book was written in English to reach wider audiences, but the stories only represent localism.
Since she is not good at Urdu, she chose English to express herself. She had a disclaimer: English houses my intellect, but not my heart.
To keep the flavour of the characters and language original and local, she frequently uses desi words in her stories without explaining them. She said foreign publishers are always sceptical about non-western writers’ work and would ask them asked about the approach of their work. She said her fiction work only aimed at bringing out Pakistani culture to the world. Being a performing art person herself, Mira has several professional performers in her stories. She also spoke on the subjects of ongoing drama serials, saying that marriages, especially the bad marriages, were the ‘in’ things, but the trend would not produce strong women in our society.   
Mira is now celebrating the success of her debut work; she has no plan to bring out her second book right now. 
“Writing is an exhaustive work, so for now, I’m just concentrating on acting projects,” she said.

Prior to this, nine trains have successfully completed their trips from Pakistan to Iran during the last two months, according to the official sources.  
“The Zahedan-bound train is on the way and is likely to enter territory of Iran in the late hours of Monday (today). The train carries a huge quantity of high quality sulfur and rice loaded from Peshawar and Gujranwala, respectively,” an official source in the Pakistan Railways explained while talking to Dawn.  
“The train, like the ITI (Islamabad-Tehran-Turkey) goods’ train, is also travelling under tight security of the railways police,” he added.  
Pakistan has broad gauge rail network having 5.6 feet width up to Zahedan (Iran). 
Therefore, the goads carried by the Pakistani trains are unloaded at Zahedan and then transshipped to trucks or the trains compatible to run on the standard gauge rail track having 4 feet and 8.5 inches width laid further (from Zahedan). 
It is also called international, uniformed normal Stephenson as well as the European gauge. It is the most widely used rail gauge across the world. 
But the broad gauge rail track is being used in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Chile and the Bay Area of San Francisco (the US).  
The Pakistan Railways (PR) is also working on a proposal for laying the country’s first standard gauge rail track from Quetta to Taftan in
a bid to make infrastructure compatible with international standards and to transport high-value goods to European and Central Asian countries within the shortest time.

2022-01-27,2022-03-21,‘Fear is state’s handy tool to suppress dissent’,"Nothing could be sacred in a country, where the constitution is not held sacred, says leftist activist and academic...","Nothing could be sacred in a country, where the constitution is not held sacred, says leftist activist and academic Ammar Ali Jan at a session on the last day of the Lahore Literary Festival held at Alhamra, The Mall, where his book ‘Rule by Fear’ was launched on Sunday.
At the session moderated by senior journalist and TV anchor Mujahid Barelvi, Jan, also founder president of his Left-oriented Huqooq-i-Khalq movement, said his book opens with one of the the darkest episodes of Indian History, Jallianwala Bagh carnage occurred at Amritsar (now India) on 13th of April, 1919. On the day, British Indian army opened indiscriminate fire on peaceful protesters, killing, as per some accounts, up to 1,500 people, on the orders of Gen Dyer.  
Jan mentions that Gen Dyer ordered the massacre just to instill fear among the Indians so that they could never think of rising against the British rulers and that state was still using the tool of fear to subjugate people demanding their rights.
Sindh University Jamshoro Assistant Professor Amar Sindhu said Jan’s book presents the case of marginalised communities. She said the most damaging thing state has done is that it erased the nation’s memory of the atrocities committed against the people, including attempts to snatch their rights, and instilled fear and uncertainty in its collective consciousness.  
She regretted that the post-Zia generation was unaware of the state oppression because they just remember Musharraf regime. She said military dictator Gen Zia ruthlessly used fear as a tool to suppress dissent, and put its opponents in the torture cells in Lahore Fort. “Whenever a government of people would take charge, Lahore Fort would be converted into a ‘museum of torture’,” she added.
Peshawar-based human rights activist Shahida Shah referred to Dalton’s theory of structural violence to expound state’s employment of torture and other forms of violence to suppress people. She said for her activism was a natural option given the political and social conditions in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa where there was an atmosphere of fear and suffocation.  
To Mr Barelvi’s question that why Pakistan’s leftists could not so far make a united front to struggle for achieving their common objectives, Jan said the Left was systematically rendered disorganised because of conspiracies. He said a scattered fight was being fought by the leftists in various parts of the country, stressing the need for unity among various leftist factions. He said the situation was, however, improving as a younger generation of Punjabi leftists were supporting their comrades from other provinces like Balochistan. In this regard he mentioned support of Punjabi students of Punjab university for the Baloch students.  
Amar Sindhu was of the opinion that leftists should not have detached themselves from local and regional issues. She regretted that public domain had been left to the mullah (rigid religious people).

The Taliban came...,"People say that Pakistan created the Taliban but it’s wrong though we might take a credit for it. The Taliban came into existence through the truck mafia, said former foreign secretary Najmuddin A. Shaikh.  
“When they used to go to Kandahar, they had to pass eight to 10 checkpoints where they had to pay a fine. The truck mafia said to the seminary students and ordinary sepoys, who were not Taliban to give it a safe passage and requested them to provide it and they did that,” he said while speaking in a session, The Imperial Ghost Wars in Afghanistan on the concluding day of the Lahore Literary Festival (LLF) on Sunday. 
“Then we said, ‘the Taliban are our boys’ but the Taliban did not accept that and told that Naseerullah Babar had nothing to do with them.” 
Mr Shaikh added that Osama bin Laden went to Afghanistan in a C-31, which was only possible through the US government. “I was then the foreign secretary. I wrote to our intelligence agencies to keep a watch on him because his presence there was going to create problems for us.” 
He termed peace in Afghanistan essential for Pakistan because any disturbance there would multiply in Pakistan.  
Former ambassador to the US Maleeha Lodhi said that for Pakistan, the US was part of an external strategy to counter India’s threatening posture with Pakistan. She said the relationship has been very mercurial, problematic and turbulent and it was best when the both sides had common objectives like both sides wanted US withdrawal from Afghanistan, both sides wanted the dissemination of Al-Qaida.  
“We are in a transitional phase. It is hard to see how the new relationship is going to be redefined unless there is meaningful engagement at the senior level which I am not seeing so far. Perhaps the US has other issues now in mind vis-à-vis Ukraine.”  
Ms Lodhi said the relationship is going to be affected by three factors, the Sino-US confrontation, India factor as Pak-India relations are not normalised and the situation of Afghanistan where Pakistan wanted a greater engagement.  
Writer and journalist Zahid Hussain said US-Pakistan relations had gone through many phases in the last sixty years but a new alliance emerged after 9/11. “Before 9/11 happened, the US and Pakistan were pursuing different policies in Afghanistan but things changed after 9/11.” 
He said after the incident, Pakistan was important for the US to engage in Afghanistan as the mastermind of 9/11 was living there and Pakistan was deeply involved in Afghanistan before that.  
“There had been a lot of political statements by political leaders that ‘one call’ led to Pakistan’s alliance with the US which was completely wrong. Pakistan did not have a choice.” 
After the return of US forces from Afghanistan, the nature of relations had completely changed and they had gone back to the same situation that was before 9/11, he said. 
Zahid Hussain added that there had been a lot of talk that the US had betrayed Pakistan but one thing should be clear that nations make their relations based on their national interests.  
He said when Taliban ruled Afghanistan before 9/11, there were no Taliban fighting in Pakistan but now the TTP had emboldened, and its back in the former tribal areas of Pakistan which should be a concern for Pakistan.  
AKBAR ZAIDI: Political economist Akbar S. Zaidi talking about his book, Making of A Muslim, said many things told about Pakistan and the Muslims of 19th century were wrong. 
“I was intrigued by the idea how the idea of a Muslim is portrayed in history, social sciences by very prominent historians, including the one who was here yesterday but I can’t take the name.  
“There was a region in Hindustan where everything was written in Urdu and our historians, with some exceptions, don’t read Urdu despite writing extensive books.”  
Mr Zaidi said the crux of this book was to explore what were the Muslims talking about in the 19th century, adding that he read newspapers from that era, exploring the Khuda Bakhsh Library in Patna, Aligarh Library and British Library. 
He said contemporary historians claim that a Muslim nation came into being after 1857. “I refuse to accept it. There was nothing like it.” 
He declared there was no better word than Zillat (humiliation). “The book has many themes and there is one theme of Zillat.”  
The Urdu speaking elite realised that the condition they were in was utter Zillat.  
“People think that the sects of Islam, Deobandi, Barelvi and Ahle Hadith, had been there since centuries. In 1867, the Deoband sect started, the Barelvis came in 1895 and Ahle Hadith originated in 1870-1875. These sects are just infants compared to the 1,400 years long history of Islam.” 
Talking about his book again, Mr Zaidi said his argument was that due to the Zillat of 1857, Aligarh came into being, Sir Syed appeared, and all Muslim sects came into being. “In Aligarh of 19th century, Ghalib was not taught and you could not talk about Urdu poetry. Keats was taught. There were a Union club and English debating club,” he said.  
“Calling Sir Syed as an educationist is bullshit. Aligarh’s objective was getting jobs and not knowledge,” Mr Zaidi declared.

2022-03-20,2022-03-21,Speak truth through poetry or you justify injustice: Natiq,"Ali Akbar Natiq wants to be known as a poet first and foremost, is how moderator Arsalan Rathore introduced the...","Ali Akbar Natiq wants to be known as a poet first and foremost, is how moderator Arsalan Rathore introduced the author and poet in a session, titled ‘Safeer-i-Laila’ -- after his book of collected poems, on the last day of Lahore Literary Festival at Alhamra on Sunday.
Mr Natiq remarked that poets have been there since the world was created, sharing that a poet can write aghazal, but everyghazalwriter can’t be a poet. He called himself a storyteller while writing poetry.
“A poet is someone who loiters aimlessly (awara gard); he talks to the trees, stars and what not. Everything in the world was created beautiful, it is us who have distorted them,” he reflected. 
The poet then talks about the use of istaara (metaphor), saying mushahida (observation) is the most important element in poetry. “Things change as we move from one location to another. So if you keep writing as you go along in life, it’ll appear fresh and attract many more readers. Poetry should make people happy; it should give them confidence about life.”
Natiq then read out some versesfrom the book under discussion.
When asked about a lot of focus on nature in his poetry, Natiq gave an example that no hotel anywhere in the world could beat lying on a charpoy under ajaamantree by a waterway with a book for company. “Nature provides a person a shadow; humans are bound for life with trees and poetry is all about love and care, which nature provides in abundance.”
The moderator asked him about his philosophy of life in terms of him having a strong voice against injustices. “If justice (adal) ends from the world, life will come to an end. The objective of poetry is to speak the truth, and if you don’t then you justify the injustice. There is no compromise on it. People make friends, but I’m known for making enemies because of opinions. History will only remember those who stand on the right side.”
Mr Natiq concluded by revealing he was working on his autobiography that will be “honest and interesting”.
Video games
Video game connoisseurs gathered to listen to art historian and ethnologist Jean-Baptiste Clais talk about his passion for the games, contemporary pop culture that he specialises in, how he put together an exhibition about video games and their connection with culture, cinema, and art.
At the start of the session, ‘Video Games as a New Domain of Creation’, moderated by digital storyteller/journalist Mariam Saeed Khan at Lahore Literary Festival, Mr Clais gave a presentation on the market shares of different video game systems, the evolution of graphics of video games and glimpses into the first video games exhibition.
Talking about the exhibition, he said since the game had to be visualised, simple colours had to be used to get public attention. “Games are inspired by the real world, includingmovies, cartoons and television, while video games also exert their influence on these media.”
When Ms Khan asked what his favourite video game was, he said there were none since as a child he wasn’t allowed to play them. “I bought a computer when I became an adult and started playing then only.”
The objective of a non-profit he volunteers for, he shared, is to maintain digital heritage, organise shows and exhibitions and display gaming machines to explain to people, especially parents, how they work.“There’s so much beauty and poetry and art out there and wonderful games.Video gaming can be shaped in so many contexts. You have to find an angle that makes it interesting. Museums are there for the community that thinks games are a part of them and their lives; they’ll cease to exist once people stop playing games.”

Addressing a dinner reception given by the Pakistan Economic Conference (PEC) in collaboration with the Faisalabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FCCI), he said the government has finally decided to devolve the Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation (PTDC) to provinces. He said all PTDC hotels, motels and other assets would be transferred to provinces under the condition that they would hand over the same to the private sector within a period of two months.
He said the government was not meant to run businesses but play the role of facilitator. He said 33 to 35 motels were lying closed for the last 10 years, as the job had been entrusted to irrelevant persons. He said the PTDC would be restructured. A national-level e-portal on tourism was ready, which would be launched by Prime Minister Imran Khan soon.
He said that a one-stop website had been developed which would have all related information about tourism sites and their managements. The government has identified the potential tourist attractions in which local and national investors could provide required facilities, he added.
He said a concept of village tourism had been introduced, which would also play a major role in promoting the country’s cultural diversity. It was a World Bank-funded project, which would attract foreign tourists to visit scenic valleys of northern areas. Similarly, a ski resort would also be developed in Chitral, which would be a unique attraction for domestic and foreign tourists, he added.
Stressing the importance of a road communication system, he said that it was very strange that a 300km stretch of Silk Road had no bathroom, which was basic and fundamental requirement of any tourist. The government is working for standardising hotels in addition to other allied services, he added.
He said qualified professionals were required to manage the hospitality industry and in this connection, schools were being established in different parts of the country.
Mr Jamil also gave a comprehensive presentation about the potential of tourism in Pakistan with steps being taken by the government to engage the private sector.
Provincial Minister for Culture and Industries Khayal Ahmad Kastro also spoke on the occasion and said that for the first time in the history of the province, the Punjab Culture Day was observed on March 14.
He said being the minister for colonies, he retrieved 200,000 acres of state land, encroached upon by land-grabbers. The value of the land was around Rs450 billion, he added.
He paid tribute to PM Khan for organising a foreign ministers’ conference of Islamic countries and said that his strategy played a pivotal role in the revival of the industrial sector in Pakistan.
Deputy Commissioner of Faisalabad Ali Shehzad also spoke on the occasion, while former president of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) Mian Mohammad Idrees and FCCI President Atif Munir Sheikh along with PEC organiser Azhar Chaudhry presented FCCI shields to Mr Jamil.
Wearing their cultural dresses, members of the business community along with their families from across the country participated in the dinner.
A traditional chador was presented to FCCI President Sheikh.

2322-03-21,2022-03-21,Literary notes: Some incorrectly attributed Urdu & Persian literary works,"THE word ‘pseudo’ means not genuine, false. And ‘epigraph’ means an inscription. Therefore, falsely...","THE word ‘pseudo’ means not genuine, false. And ‘epigraph’ means an inscription. Therefore, falsely attributed texts are sometimes referred to as ‘pseudepigraphs’ in literary criticism. 
A misattributed or ‘pseudegraphic’ text is the work whose generally known author is not the real author and it turns out to have actually been written by someone else. Incorrectly attributed literary works are not always result of literary forgeries and sometimes misattribution is unintentional, though plagiarists and cheats do involve in such malpractices. 
Richard D. Altick (1915-2008) is considered a world authority on research methodology. On misattribution he says that we have “to identify the author of anonymous or pseudonymous works (or works attributed to the wrong writer); to decide which parts of a work written by two or more authors belong to whom; and to remove from the received list of a writer’s works whatever pieces are not his, thereby purifying his canon (the roster of his authentic writings)”. 
In our literary history, we come across works that have been attributed to authors who did not pen them. Such studies are known, in Urdu, as ‘tehqeeq-i-mansoobaat’, or research on misattributions. Some of our scholars have busted many myths. Revisiting these facts would be of interest: 
General perception about Qissa Chahar Durvesh was that it was originally written in Persian by Ameer Khusrau, but Hafiz Mahmood Sherani proved that it was written in Mughal era, some 300 years later than Khusrau’s era, though various Urdu versions are based on Persian texts. 
M’eraaj-ul-Aashiqeen, a work on Sufism, was edited by Moulvi Abdul Haq and he said it was penned by Hazrat Syed Muhammad Husaini Banda Nawaz Gesu Daraaz. Dr Husaini Shahid and, later on, Dr Hafeez Qateel, proved that it was not written by Hazrat Gesu Daraaz but a shorter version of Tilavat-ul-Vujood, a work by Makhdoom Shah Husaini. 
It was commonly believed that Firdousi had composed a hajv (lampoon) to vent his resentment against Mahmood Ghaznavi, but Hafiz Mahmood Sherani proved that some of the couplets included in the so-called hajv were composed by some other poets and a few others were taken out of contest from Firdousi’s Shah nama and joined together with some fake verses. He also proved that the number of couplets in Mahmood’s hajv kept on increasing in numbers with the passage of time. 
A booklet named Risala-i-Kashf-ul-Asraar is attributed to Hazrat Ali Bin Usman Hajveri, popularly known as Data Ganj Bakhsh. Hakeem Muhammad Moosa Amritsari proved that the attribution is false, and perhaps intentional, as it is written in ‘Sabk-i-Hindi’, or Indian style of Persian, and Hazrat Data Sahib’s Kashf-ul-Mahjoob is in a prose style belonging to Samanid or Samanian era. 
Naval Kishor, the famous publisher from Lucknow, had published several editions of Divan-i-Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti Ajmeri. Hafiz Mahmood Sherani proved that no critic had mentioned Khwaja Ajmeri’s poetry until 500 years after his death and the attribution is incorrect. Sherani wrote that it might have been penned by Maulana Moinuddin Bin Sharafuddin. 
Dr Ghulam Mustafa Khan wrote that a Persian divan published by Naval Kishor (5th edition, 1883) is wrongly attributed to Hazrat Abdul Qadir Jeelani. He has cited certain evidences that prove his point of view and establish the fact that the divan is not authored by Hazrat Abdul Qadir Jeelani. 
Dr Nazeer Ahmed has written that there are some quatrains in the divan of Hafiz Sherazi that were not written by Hafiz as these quatrains are included in Nuzhat-ul-Majalis. We know that Nuzhat-ul-Majalis, an anthology of quatrains, was compiled in 13th century AD and Hafiz was born in 14th century AD. 
Mazhar-ul-A’jaaib, is attributed to Fareeduddin Attar, but Khaliq Anjum wrote that it was written by someone else and attributed to Attar with religious motives. 
Khaliq Anjum wrote that most of the books attributed to the Sufis of Chishtiya order are either fake or misattributed. 
Qazi Abdul Wadood proved that Gulistan-i-Sukhan was written by Imam Bakhsh Sebhai and its attribution to Mirza Qadir Bakhsh Sabir is incorrect. 
Some manuscripts of Mirza Sauda’s kulliyaat (collected works) have verses that were not composed by Sauda, wrote Khaliq Anjum and Rasheed Hasan Khan. Such interpolations are not uncommon in classical Urdu poetry manuscripts. 
Hafiz Mahmood Sherani wrote that Khaliq Bari was not written by Ameer Khusrau and its original author was someone else also named Khusrau. 
It is a known fact that Mirza Ghalib wrote the book Lataaif-i-Ghaibi to defend himself but put his friend Miandad Khan Sayyah’s name on its title as author. 
It is a misconception that Divan-i-Makhfi was written by Zaibunnisa Makhfi, daughter of Aurangzeb Alamgir. 
Facts about suspected or incorrect attributions presented in this piece have been collected from different sources, especially an issue of Tehqeeq, a research journal edited by Dr Najm-ul-Islam. Some are from Khaliq Anjum’s book Matni Tanqeed.

“We are ready to provide complete protection to the visiting national and international players, as well as spectators, during the series,” he said, adding the security plan was more elaborate than that of previous matches.  
Pakistan and Australia will play one test match, three one-day international matches and one T-20 match in Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium from March 21 to April 5.
According to the security plan, more than 8,000 police officials, including SPs, SDPOs, SHOs from Dolphin Squad, Police Response Unit and Elite Force, will perform security, patrolling and traffic management duties during the matches.
Australian players and officials have been given the status of state guests, according to the government directions.  
The CCPO said close circuit TV cameras around the stadium and parking areas had been made fully operational to ensure strict vigilance during the cricket series.  
He said efforts would be made to ensure that the routine activities of the people, especially of traders and businessmen, were least disturbed during the matches.  
He said ‘zero route’ would be provided to the teams to ensure their security by containing traffic only during their movement from the residential places to the stadium and vice versa.  
He said four-layer security would be ensured at the stadium and spectators would only be allowed to enter after a thorough checking process. The Covid-19 protocols would also be followed, he added.  
Dev said round-the-clock monitoring of the residential places of teams, routes, matches and movement of players had been ensured through CCTV cameras, while snipers would be deployed on the rooftops of buildings during the matches.  
He said search and sweep operations were also being conducted on a daily basis in the city, particularly around the stadium and in designated areas.  
The CCPO directed the officers concerned to coordinate with related departments, including the Punjab Safe Cities Authority, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), district administration and law enforcement agencies to successfully implement the security plan.

The academic year in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa usually starts in April and ends in March. The school administration conducts annual home exams up to grade-8 in March and results are declared on March 31 each academic year. 
However, in the light of the federal government’s decision, the E&SE Department has decided to start the upcoming academic year from August instead of April, saying the students’ time had been wasted when schools were closed due to Covid-19 pandemic at the start of the ongoing academic year. 
“Due to delay caused by the Covid-19 situation, the academic year 2022-23 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa shall commence from August 1, 2022, and conclude on April 30, 2023, and the academic year 2023-24 shall commence from May 1, 2023,” reads a notification issued by the education department in the start of March. 

Teachers fear wastage of time, say they had completed courses in February

A principal of a government high school told Dawn that in the ongoing academic year, classes started in July which continued non-stop for nine months. However, he said that the school administration could not take examinations from the students due to ‘illogical’ decision of the government. 
A science teacher in a government school told Dawn that he had completed teaching his courses at the end of January. “I have completed courses of three subjects, including chemistry and Physics for class-10, and general science for grade-8,” he said. 
As per the school principal’s directives, he said, the teachers had now engaged their students in different activities like revision of their courses, weekly tests, etc. 
Several principals of the government schools said the E&SE Department had not communicated to the schools in writing about annual home examinations. 
However, a district education officer said that a senior officer of education department had recently verbally communicated to the district education officers to issue directives to the government schools to conduct examinations by the end of May. 
In plain areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the summer vacation usually starts in government schools in June. 
“The teachers usually send their students for summer vacation with proper homework of the subjects taught in April and May, to be revised during the vacation,” a teacher said. 
However, he said, if they started the summer vacation at the start of June in the instant case, they would not be able to give homework to the students because they would not have started their next classes and thus the students would waste three months of summer vacation. 
School Officers Association, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, president Samiullah Khalil told Dawn that the association also had reservations about the start of academic year from August as it would waste precious time of the students. 
He said that the office-bearers of the teachers association raised this issue with the recently-posted secretary education in a meeting and demanded to revisit the decision of starting the academic year from August. 
He said it was clear in the education department’s notification that the next academic year would start from August, but it had not given any direction when the ongoing academic year would be ended. 
He said the association had also demanded of the government to hold annual home examinations in April. However, he said, the association could take its own decision of holding examinations in April in the larger interest of students.

2022-03-20,2022-03-21,Pakistan signs deal to avoid $11bn penalty in Reko Diq case,PM Imran congratulates the nation on the agreement for the development of the Reko Diq mine.,"ISLAMABAD: The government on Sunday claimed to have saved the country from $11 billion penalty in Reko Diq case and reconstituted a project aimed at excavating huge gold and copper reserves from the site in Balochistan. 
The federal and Balochistan governments and two international firms — Antofagasta PLC and Barrick Gold Corporation — have reached an agreement in principle on a framework to reconstitute the Reko Diq project, and a pathway for Antofagasta to exit the project. 
Prime Minister Imran Khan witnessed the signing ceremony. Speaking on the occasion, he expressed the hope that the investment would mark the beginning of large-scale investments in Balochistan that would change the quality of life of ordinary citizens in the province. 
Later, in a series of tweets, PM Khan congratulated the nation, specially the people of Balochistan, on the agreement for development of Reko Diq mine. 
“I congratulate the nation & ppl of Balochistan on successful agreement with Barrick Gold for development of Reko Diq mine after 10 years of legal battles & negotiations. Penalty of approx [approximately] $11bn is off set, $10bn will be invested in Balochistan creating 8,000 new jobs,” the prime minister tweeted. “RD [Reko Diq] will potentially be the largest gold & copper mine in the world. It will liberate us from crippling debt & usher in a new era of development & prosperity,” he wrote. 

 





 
Meanwhile, the Balochistan cabinet in a special session approved the agreement, terming it a game changer for the province. 
Later, addressing a press conference along with Energy Minister Hammad Azhar and Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo, Minister for Finance Shaukat Tarin said that after the signing of the agreement Pakistan would not only avoid the $11bn penalty but also get an opportunity to explore the world’s largest gold and copper reserve. 
He said some $10bn would be invested under the Reko Diq project which would create 8,000 new jobs for the locals. The minister said that as per the new agreement, Barrick Gold Corporation would get 50 per cent and the Balochistan government 25pc share, while the rest 25pc would be shared among the state-owned enterprises — Oil and Gas Development Company (OGDCL), Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) and Government Holdings Pakistan (GHPL). 
Mr Tarin recalled that the federal and Balochistan governments had in 2006 signed an agreement with Canadian company Barrick Gold and Chilean firm Antofagasta to extract gold and copper from Reko Diq mine. According to the deal, 37.5pc share each was given to the two foreign companies and 25pc to the Balochistan government. 
He said that agreement was suspended in 2011 due to a dispute over the legality of its licensing process. As a result, the Interna­tional Court of Arbitration levelled $6.4bn award on the government of Pakistan while at the same time the London Court of Arbitration was also imposing another $4bn fine on Pakistan. 
He said that soon after taking over the charge, PM Khan aggressively pursued the case. As a result, an agreement was signed on Sunday under which Antofagasta decided not to participate in the reconstituted project and withdrew from its claim of $3.9bn in place of $900 million, which would be paid by the three state-owned enterprises in return for a 25pc share. 
The minister said Pakistan, particularly Balochistan, would be benefited for over 100 years from this project and the total worth is estimated to be over $100bn. 
Terming the deal a landmark achievement, Energy Minister Hammad Azhar said it was a historic day as it had not only avoided $11bn worth of penalty but also created a new opportunity for the country. He said the “landmark success” had also saved the country from blacklisted by the FATF by implementing 32 of the 35 conditions.  
Meanwhile, President of Barrick Gold Mark Bristow had a meeting with Balochistan Chief Minister Qudoos Bizenjo after the signing of the agreement.

2022-03-20,2022-03-21,Dissidents to face social boycott: PM Imran,PM blames several media houses for siding with dacoits and taking money from foreign powers to topple govt.,"MALAKAND: Prime Minister Imran Khan has claimed that he has been advised by party colleagues to bring the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf dissidents back into the party fold by offering the same bribe as proffered by the opposition, but he rejected the advice telling them that he would rather prefer to lose his government than taking the path of horse-trading.
Addressing a public meeting in the Dargai area of Malakand on Sunday, Prime Minister Khan also criticised several media houses for ‘siding with the dacoits’ and blamed them for ‘selling out to foreign powers’. 
PM Khan, in his speech, also recounted all the achievements of his government, including record tax collection, exports and remittances, during the past three and a half months.
He alleged that the dacoits were using public money to buy PTI lawmakers but told the opposition that it was going to lose “this match”. He also vowed that he would never opt for horse-trading with public money, as the opposition did. However, he promised that like a father he would forgive the disgruntled PTI lawmakers, who had been ‘deceived’ by opposition parties to vote for no-trust motion against him, if they repented and returned to the party fold. At the same time, Mr Khan warned other dissatisfied PTI leaders, “Return to the party fold or face social boycott.” He urged the turncoats to think of their children and families, saying that they would lose respect and honour in society. “People will neither trust nor respect you. Masses are aware of whatever is happening in the country. This is the age of social media where it’s difficult to hide anything from them,” he asserted, adding that Changa Manga-like politics was not possible in the digital age.

Imran blames several media houses for siding with dacoits and taking money from foreign powers to topple govt

Talking about the mainstream media, PM Khan said the media had a major role in any democracy. “It is media duty to create awareness. To stand with the good, the biggest responsibility lies with the media. It must raise voice against evil. But I have to say it that unfortunately many media houses are getting money, several of them are receiving money from abroad. 
“And I leave it to the Pakistani nation that when you see the [section of] media you will find them standing with the dacoits who are destroying democracy. 
“If any foreign power wants to topple the government, how easy it is: just buy the loyalty of 20 hypocrites and the government will fall,” the prime minister said.
PM Khan also warned the media standing with the ‘dacoits’ [opposition], they should understand “the nation is watching you.” At this moment when the nation was on the two extremes, people were also watching which section of the media was standing with the country and its people and which one was standing with the dacoits, he asserted. 
Criticising Leader of Opposition in the National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif and other opposition party leaders, Mr Kahn said people could identify the ‘three stooges’ from the opposition who had been facing corruption cases for looting the country for years. He sounded confident the opposition would badly lose the match. He told the public meeting that a decisive moment had arrived in the history of Pakistan. He alleged that the corrupt mafia was offering bribes to the ruling party lawmakers to buy their loyalties with their ill-gotten money.
The judiciary, election commission and the nation were observing the situation, Mr Khan said. 
In the UK, he said, the members of parliament never sold their loyalties because they had strong democratic values and political insight. “They can never imagine such cheap tactics in politics,” he added.
The prime minister alleged that bags filled with stacks of money were being given to his party lawmakers at Sindh House, terming the action ‘funeral of democracy’. He appealed to the nation it was “your obligation to stand up and raise your voice against such tactics on part of the opposition parties”.
‘Foreign policy to favour people’
In his speech, PM Khan also lauded India for having an ‘independent’ foreign policy that was favourable to own people. He said he never bowed down before anyone and would not let the nation bow down. He said his foreign policy would also favour the people of Pakistan.
He maintained that he had said no to the European Union envoys who sought Pakistan support against Russia in the Ukraine conflict, because they broke protocol by making the joint statement public. Pakistan would have gained nothing by complying with the EU’s request, he said, adding that Pakistan being an independent country would not become part of any bloc.
He said Pakistan could not make progress if it remained slave to the world superpowers. He said the nation would not prosper until it stood on its own feet. Only hypocrites would never stand by the people, because they ‘worship money’, he remarked.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,"Detained in India, Pakistan’s Sumaira to return next week","Her husband, an Indian national, took her there without a visa via the Nepal border.","ISLAMABAD: Sumaira Rehman, a Pakistani woman languishing in a prison in Bangalore, India, is set to return to her home country next week along with her four-year-old daughter Sana Fatima.
“Indian authorities have completed all formalities for the release of the Pakistani woman. She is expected to arrive in Pakistan next week with her four-year-old daughter Sana Fatima,” PML-N Senator Irfan Siddiqui told Dawn by phone from Dubai.
Meanwhile, Suhana Biswa Patna, an Indian woman lawyer working for the release from the Bangalore prison and her repatriation to Pakistan, has thanked Senator Siddiqui for raising the issue of Ms Sumaira’s release and her repatriation to Pakistan.
“Allow me to thank you for raising the matter in the Senate. We would not have seen this day without your help,” Ms Patna, a leading Indian lawyer fighting for human rights, especially for jailed women, told Mr Siddiqui by phone.

Her husband, an Indian national, took her there without a visa via Nepal border

“Thank you sir for all your help. Both Sumaira and I are very grateful,” Ms Patna said in a message. Senator Siddiqui also appreciated Ms Patna’s efforts and thanked her.
Senator Siddiqui said that he was in touch with the Indian lawyer, Pakistan Foreign Office and Asma Jahangir Legal Aid Cell and was getting information on a daily basis.
He said that after the issuance of an NoC from the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs has also completed all formalities and it was working with Pakistani authorities to finalise arrangements for Ms Sumaira’s return to the country. It is likely that she, along with her daughter, would return home next week.
He said the state had to play an important role with regard to Ms Sumaira and her daughter, adding that after the Pakistani woman’s return to the country he would table a formal resolution in the Senate on the negligence and dereliction of duty by Pakistani officials concerned.
Ms Sumaira married an Indian national Mohammad Shihab of Palakkad, Kerala, whom she had met in Qatar.
Shihab took her to India without a visa in September 2016 via Nepal border. She was arrested in May 2017 and was subsequently sentenced to three years in prison.
Two months later, she gave birth to a baby girl. Her husband left her when she was in custody. Since her release from prison, Ms Sumaira has been living at a detention centre in Banga­lore with her daughter.
Pakistan had finally issued a citizenship certificate to Sumaira on February 17, paving the way for her return to Pakistan with her daughter.
The same day the certificate was communicated to Pakistan’s High Commission in New Delhi through the Foreign Office to instantly reach relevant authorities.
The certificate was issued after Senator Siddiqui raised the issue in the House twice in a week.

2022-03-24,2022-03-21,Trilateral talks on trans-Afghan rail project due next week,BoI chairman will interact with potential investors from many countries for B2B meetings in Tashkent.,"

STATE Minister and BoI chairman Azfar Ahsan.

 
ISLAMABAD: Senior officials of Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Afghanistan will meet in Tashkent next week for a trilateral meeting to discuss a potential railway project aimed at laying a railway track linking Termez, Mazar-i-Sharif, Kabul and Peshawar to promote trade in the region.
Minister of State and chairman of the Board of Investment (BoI) Azfar Ahsan has left Islamabad for Tashkent to participate in the trilateral meeting.
In addition to the trilateral meeting, Mr Ahsan will also participate in the Tashkent Inter­national Investment Forum which will be held from March 24 to 26.
The Uzbekistan president is taking special interest in the laying of the railway track with Pakistan via Afghanistan for its future trade and business activities. Uzbekistan, being a landlocked country, has been dependent on Iran’s trade routes for its imports and exports and the sanctions on Iran have made it difficult for Uzbekistan to continue using the same route.

BoI chairman will interact with potential investors from many countries for B2B meetings in Tashkent

The proposed railway connectivity has also been discussed at various international forums, including the Shanghai Coope­ration Organisation (SCO).
During his visit to Pakistan early this month, Uzbek Presi­dent Shavkat Mirziyoyev reaffirmed the important role of the railway project linking the three countries for the future of the region.
Pakistan and Uzbekistan have agreed to evolve a joint ‘roadmap’ which includes measures to develop a feasibility study for the project and start construction work on both sides.
The Trans-Afghan Railway project is stated to be the most economical and shortest route connecting Central Asia to Pakistan’s ports of Karachi, Gwadar and Port Qasim.
The two countries have already signed the bilateral Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA) and the enforcement of the Transit Trade Agreement. These agreements are the sign of the beginning of a new era in bilateral trade relations and will serve to increase mutual trade by utilising existing opportunities.
The Tashkent International Inves­tment Forum is being convened under the theme of “Realising New Growth Agenda” and expects to bring over 200 leaders from the government, busi­ness, civil society and academia to discuss and shape regio­nal as well as industry agendas.
The BoI chairman, who will be the keynote speaker at the inaugural session of the forum, will also meet Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev on the sidelines of the forum and will interact with potential investors from many countries as head of delegation from Pakistan for business-to-business (B2B) meetings.
An official of BoI says the visit of Mr Ahsan is being of paramount importance for Pakistan on diplomatic and economic front as it comes at a time when strategic ties between Uzbekistan and Pakistan are moving in an upward trajectory. 
The BoI chairman envisages that the visit will culminate into fruitful economic cooperation between the three countries and will further strengthen diplomatic and strategic ties.
The forum aims to explore areas of trilateral cooperation among Uzbekistan, Pakistan and Afghanistan and revolves around discussing the investment potential of Central Asia, transformations in trade flows in Central Asia, digitalisation of transport systems, attracting investments in tourism sector, production modernisation and new agricultural markets.
Mr Ahsan, during his visit, will also hold a meeting with Uzbek Minister of Transport I. Makhkamov and the head of the Afghan delegation in Termez. The discussions will centre on the available conditions of cargo transportation in Pakistan and proposals for increasing the volume of traffic between the three countries will be discussed from Pakistan’s perspective.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,NAB names new prosecutor in Avenfield case,"Imtiaz Siddiqui is a senior lawyer based in Lahore and has vast experience in handling corporate, banking and tax-related matters.","ISLAMABAD: In less than a month after replacing the lead prosecutor, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has appointed another special prosecutor to counter the appeal filed by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Maryam Nawaz Sharif against her conviction in the Avenfield apartments reference.
The newly appointed special prosecutor, Imtiaz  Siddiqui, is a senior lawyer based in Lahore and has vast experience in  handling corporate, banking and tax-related matters.
Sources said  Advocate Siddiqui would appear before a two-member Islamabad High Court  (IHC) bench, comprising Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, on Monday (today) and would lead the prosecution.
He  has been appointed in less than a month after NAB had brought a private lawyer, Mohammad Azhar Siddique, as its lead prosecutor for Ms Sharif’s  case.
Mr Siddique had put a single appearance before the IHC bench  last month and sought a month-long adjournment to prepare arguments. The hearing was then adjourned until March 21 (today). 
He had replaced Barrister Usman Cheema, also a private lawyer who had been appointed by NAB as its special prosecutor.
Prosecutor  Cheema skipped a couple of hearings and then sought another adjournment  for being Covid-19 positive. However, after recovery he recused himself  from the case. 
Earlier in September, NAB started pursuing  the appeal vigorously and even filed an application seeking day-to-day  hearings. But the bureau started seeking frequent adjournments  after the IHC bench raised questions on the admissibility of the  evidence produced before the trial court against Ms Sharif.

Presided over by party’s President Dr Malik Baloch, the NP’s central cabinet reviewed the agreement in detail and observed that foreign control over natural resources of the people of Balochistan was not acceptable for the party.
The participants of the meeting were of the opinion that the new agreement was a fraud with the people of Balochistan in the name of development. The meeting pledged not to allow the Balochistan government to sell out natural resources of the province at throwaway prices.
“The people of Balochistan and the National Party reject the Reko Diq Copper-Cum-Gold Project agreement outright,” said a statement issued by the party after its Central Cabinet meeting late Sunday night. 
It said the Balochistan government had ratified the agreement at its meeting of the provincial cabinet in which a majority of the cabinet members were not present, which proved the dishonesty of the provincial government in approving the agreement.
Besides, it said, the federal government had also lost its mandate after the tabling of a no-confidence motion against the prime minister in the National Assembly.
It said that the terms and conditions of the Reko Diq agreement had not been mentioned and they had been kept secret and, therefore, such an accord was not acceptable to the NP and the people of Balochistan as they were not aware of the details of the agreement. The party said the agreement was also unacceptable because it had been signed at a time when the country was witnessing political turmoil.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Finding and filling health  gaps digitally,"While various startups addresses a spectrum of challenges, till the net is cast wider and deeper, health tech will not be a...","“A man was having severe heart problems in Loralai, Balochistan,” narrates Dr Sara Saeed Khurram, co-founder of Sehat Kahani. “It was during the peak of the pandemic when the country was under lockdown and access to medical advice, tricky at the best of times in remote areas of Pakistan, had become all the more challenging. But he was able to connect to a doctor through Sehat Kahani and got prescribed the required medicine that helped save his life.”
With a ratio of one doctor for every 1,200 patients, half the population of Pakistan does not have access to basic primary healthcare services. Hand-in-hand is the phenomenon of doctor bahus: women who train medically but for a myriad of reasons are unable to practice in a country that desperately needs more doctors.
Born out of Dr Khurram’s personal experience, Sehat Kahani is a health tech social enterprise that provides a solution to both problems. “I was practicing when I had to shift cities. By chance, I connected to the nurse on duty at my old desk who told me patients were still coming to the clinic but no doctor was available. I started consulting on the phone and eventually got a webcam. Over time the chance encounter evolved into Sehat Kahani,” says Dr Khurram.
Operating through a network of 37 clinics, to date Sehat Kahani has offered 850,000 consultations and employs 7,000 doctors of which 85 per cent are females.

While various startups addresses a spectrum of challenges, till the net is cast wider and deeper, health tech will not be a panacea for all healthcare problems in Pakistan

According to the global health security index 2021, Pakistan is ranked 130 out of 195. From being able to access medical advice to the purchase of genuine medicine to recognising the presence of a disease, there are challenges across the entire process. Digitisation has stepped in to address many of the gaps of which Sehat Kahani is a case in point.
“We have saved six people from committing suicide in Pakistan,” says Syed Naseh, CTO of Saaya Health, a mental health platform. Available in seven languages globally and Urdu, Punjabi, Pashto and Sindhi in Pakistan, Saaya Health has conducted over 4,000 counselling sessions and its social-emotional learning content has reached about 100,000 children.
One in four people in Pakistan suffer from mental health issues. In Karachi, where multi-generational families live in small apartments, one in three suffer from depression and anxiety. And yet, there is a taboo around mental health with those seeking it as perceived to be ‘mad’, explains COO Alizeh Valjee who has a background in psychology.
During the pandemic, relationship issues were exacerbated, increasing domestic violence. The rate of disability and dysfunction increased in those with existing mental health issues along with burnout rates. Stress related to financial insecurities, rise in unemployment and poverty, lack of access to social support and recreational outlets, inability to access the health system during the lockdown and overall anxiety due to uncertainty together made an environment highly conducive to debilitating mental health and holistic wellbeing.
But things are improving, says Mr Naseh. Mental health is becoming less of a taboo, more literature is being produced and more universities are offering psychology cases, he said while giving the example of the recently held Karachi Wellness Festival.
However, all access to healthcare becomes meaningless if the medicines bought to address the illnesses are fake. And Pakistan’s problems with counterfeit drugs is endemic, with some research statistics indicating that 40-50pc of medicine sold are fake.
“We are trying to connect the pharma companies directly to the patient to help eliminate fake medicines from the system,” says Furquan Kidwai, founder and CEO of online pharmacy Dawaai.
There are 500-plus pharmaceutical companies in the country that are manufacturing drugs distributed by 1000-plus distributors through 45,000-plus licensed pharmacies, he explains using numbers to explain how fragmented the market is. This has resulted in the creation of many layers between the pharma company and the end consumer that has allowed one of the biggest counterfeit medicine markets in the world to flourish.
Because of the cryogenic nature of the market, there are about 20,000 unique SKUs (stock-taking units) available for about 500-600 medicines — each medicine is sold under 10-15 different names. “Take Paracetamol as an example. It is sold under 30 different names — Panadol, Paramol, Parasol etc,” he says.
An average shop has say about 200 SKUs so patients have to go through the hassle of visiting multiple pharmacies to get their prescription fulfilled. The pandemic pushed Dawaai’s user adoption rate to 5x-6x, leading to a current growth rate of 9x. 
The health tech numbers are impressive. One source says there are 331 health tech startups in Pakistan, another says telehealth companies grew by 900pc during the pandemic. But this picture is skewed. While various health tech addresses a spectrum of challenges, from menstrual health to setting up appointments with doctors, the ease of access is limited to the relatively affluent that have access to the internet and a basic understanding of technology. Till the net is cast wider and deeper, health tech will not be a panacea for all healthcare problems in Pakistan.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Looking towards the small guy,"There are more than 3,000 Pakistani sellers on Alibaba.com with close to 90pc of them coming from Sialkot","

Mr Song Song, Country Manager, Ali Baba

 
For as long as one can remember, Pakistan has been stuck in a perpetual cycle of boom and busts. Ask any minister, finance bro or stock analyst masquerading as an economist the recipe to break free from this and they will tell you increasing exports is the answer. That’s also something Commerce Advisor Abdul Razak Dawood has made a key priority since the first day. 
One such measure his ministry could claim credit for was getting Pakistan placed on the Amazon’s sellers’ list, which we were told would open new avenues for exports for local entrepreneurs. How many of those businesses, mostly used to business-to-business (B2B )contracts, would actually be able to position themselves in the direct-to-consumer (D2C) segment on arguably the most competitive marketplace on the planet was a different matter altogether. 

There are more than 3,000 Pakistani sellers on Alibaba.com with close to 90pc of them coming from Sialkot

Meanwhile, a few thousand businesses from the country had focused their energies eastward towards Alibaba.com. In fact, Pakistan now ranks the highest in terms of paid sellers on the world’s largest B2B e-commerce platform’s Global Business. Since 2017-18, the number of Pakistani sellers on the platform has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent, according to a presentation the company presented to a roundtable at the Board of Investment’s recent conference. 
“There are more than 3,000 Pakistani sellers on Alibaba.com with close to 90pc of them coming from Sialkot,” says Mr Song Song, the company’s country manager for Pakistan. And now he wants to expand the platform’s reach to traders and businesses in other cities, especially the export-oriented ones like Faisalabad and Gujranwala, in addition to Karachi and Lahore. For that purpose, he and his team have been increasing their outreach efforts through awareness sessions at the various chambers of commerce and industries. 
“Apparel is the most popular category among Pakistani sellers, followed by sports goods and surgical equipment given that the majority of our users are from Sialkot,” he shares. According to the ‘Digital B2B Outlook 2022 Pakistan’ published by Alibaba at the beginning of the year, 63pc of the sellers are in the apparel category while a total of 3.2 million listings have been made from the country so far. But how much does that translate into dollar terms? “Unfortunately even we don’t know the gross merchandise value of goods sold from the country on our platform,” Mr Song Song says. 
That’s strange, isn’t it? Maybe at first. As a B2B e-commerce platform facilitating cross-border trade across hundreds of geographies, Alibaba.com is used by many buyers and sellers for discovery and information before actually negotiating the deal between themselves. “Outside China, the US and Malaysia, the transactions still take place offline so it becomes difficult for us to estimate the worth of goods sold,” the executive explains. 
The reason behind that is, of course, the complicated nature of B2B payments which is made even more complex due to the cross-border nature of transactions. “It’s not like B2C where the average order value would be a few dollars. You are talking hundreds of thousands or even a million dollars per order which the current infrastructure doesn’t allow for in Pakistan. And payments are just one component of it; there’s also fulfilment, integration with customs authorities etc. That entire ecosystem needs to be built,” Mr Song Song says.  
In that case, who else to build the ecosystem other than Alibaba.com — the most successful B2B e-commerce platform? “It requires huge amounts of investments as well as time. In China, it took us around five years to develop it,” he says. Before the company embarks on such an ambitious plan, it first wants to create a local presence and create more awareness among the sellers. 
“We are going to set up a local entity for Alibaba.com, the first such for any of the companies of the Alibaba Group [excluding Daraz and Easypaisa as they were acquisitions], and build an on-ground team in Pakistan for functions like customer service, outreach and marketing by the end of the calendar year,” Mr SongSong shares. This is along with growing their channel partners — currently numbering 10 — who currently act as the e-commerce platform’s representatives in the country and help onboard new users and provide support to the existing ones.

2021-07-27,2022-03-21,Hasty growth in housing finance,The euphoric demand for housing finance and a liberal supply of loans remains subject to ground reality checks.,"Agriculture and housing loans — along with micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) finance — are vital for boosting economic activity. And, if banks start lending more to all the three sectors at the same time, that almost guarantees accelerated GDP growth in the short-to-medium term. 
Currently, though, banks are not wholesomely engaged in such an exercise. But the government and the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) are trying to promote just that. Policies introduced for accelerating housing loans offer an added advantage to the government — they make room for politically-motivated tax amnesty in the name of the documentation of the economy. The ongoing Naya Pakistan Housing Programme (NPHP) is no exception.
Regardless of the fact that this is opening yet another avenue under this programme for the whitening of tax-evaded money, housing loans being offered under NPHP are quite promising. Already, they have reactivated the real estate and building construction sector and continue to enliven demand for outputs of dozens of allied industries and services sub-sectors. Their impact on the overall economy (rebased to 2015-16) is already being felt and is sure to become more and more pronounced with the passage of time. That is if future governments let the programme continue in its current form and spirit.

The euphoric demand for housing finance and liberal supply of loans remains subject to ground reality checks after the expiry of the tax amnesty scheme 

Within seven months of this fiscal year (ie between July 2021 and Jan 2022), banks disbursed fresh consumers loans of Rs47.6 billion for the construction of buildings. In addition to this, they also disbursed Rs11.8bn loans to their employees for the same purpose.
Thus, overall lending for construction of buildings in the first seven months of this fiscal year totalled Rs59.4bn, the latest SBP stats reveal. During the same period of the last fiscal year, total lending for housing buildings was too small — Rs7.9bn for general consumers and Rs22bn for bank employees or a total of Rs29.9bn! 
The demand for housing finance remained strong right from the beginning of this fiscal year partly because builders were using tax-evaded money for launching new housing projects following extension in the tax amnesty scheme. Partly, higher economic growth in 2021-21 compared to that of 2019-20 also motivated people to take advantage of the Naya Pakistan Housing Programme made easier this year — and apply for housing loans. 
So, the volumes of housing finance offered so far could have been larger had banks been able to process loans applications a bit more speedily. The PTI government, challenged on all fronts and struggling for its survival, is pushing banks to their limits through the central bank to accelerate the disbursement of housing loans. So, one can hope that the volumes of fresh housing loans would grow even faster in near future, more so because the “no-question asked” status of the investment coming into this sector has been extended — once again — to the end of FY22 in June.

The overall lending for construction of buildings in the first seven months of this fiscal year totalled Rs59.4bn while during the same period last fiscal year, total lending for housing buildings was Rs7.9bn for general consumers and Rs22bn for bank employees or a total of Rs29.9bn

Growth in housing finance and underlying expansion in construction activities continue to fuel growth in allied sectors as well. During July-Dec 2021, manufacturing of iron and steel grew by 18.4 per cent, whereas in the same period of 2020 this sub-sector of large-scale manufacturing had contracted by 12.1pc, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics. 
Monthly cement production which was below 3.7 million tonnes in July 2021 gradually picked up and peaked at 4.48m tonnes in October before coming down to 4.3m tonnes and 4m tonnes in November and December respectively, due to a dramatic rise in the cost of production of coal-fired cement plants after skyrocketing of coal prices in international markets — and not due to slackness in demand. 
To meet the increasing demand for housing finance, and particularly to meet the demand for low-cost housing, the SBP has now eased prudential regulations of microfinance banks. “The changes made in the prudential regulations include additional guidance on property assessment, mortgage creation and risk management,” the central bank announced on March 16. By end of 2021, total lending already made in the housing sector stood at Rs20bn — the number of beneficiaries was 75,000, an SBP press release said.
Moving forward, accelerated disbursement of housing finance through microfinance banks can be expected to boost volumes of financing and enhance the number of loan takers. But whether microfinance loans for housing can actually lead to the construction of new low-cost housing units is doubtful. These loans are likely to end up for purchasing already constructed flats and one-unit residential units or for the renovation of existing houses and apartments. 
The current euphoric demand for housing finance from commercial banks and an equally liberal supply of housing loans remain subject to ground reality checks after the expiry of the tax amnesty scheme in June. If tax amnesty for investment in the housing sector is allowed to expire on time — and not extended any further — construction of new houses and apartments may come to a halt. But that perhaps doesn’t bother the government. 
Another worrisome aspect of the housing finance euphoria is that banks are offering housing loans to their employees, particularly senior executives, a bit too liberally. The central bank needs to watch mortgage finance to bank employees closely to ward off any possible development of banks-builders nexus. Powerful builders particularly those with strong links with politicians and the establishment have successfully circumvented banking and environmental laws in the past for the construction of prized projects both in Karachi and Islamabad. Some of them still continue to do this. 
While making more housing loans, banks must also focus on ensuring their sustainability in terms of market risks and the risk of defaults.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,The challenges of the electronic warehouse receipt system,"If run professionally and efficiently, it may reduce pressure on farmers to sell their produce in panic immediately ...","The resource-constraint smallholder farmers are unattractive candidates for credit from formal financial institutions, which tend to ignore them because of their often unpredictable, fragmented and unstructured agricultural activities.
The State Bank of Pakistan, like the central banks of many other developing countries, is introducing schemes to increase access of small farmers to the formal credit channels, saving them from exploitation by informal money lenders.
The SBP, in this respect, has recently launched the electronic warehouse receipt (EWR) system for maize crop in Kasur district, almost a year after the scheme was introduced for paddy crop in Hafizabad, another central Punjab district. The EWR enables the depositor, whether a producer or dealer, of an agriculture commodity to use it as collateral for obtaining bank loans or trade in commodity markets, if and when the system is linked with the commodities exchange as well.
If run professionally and efficiently, it may also reduce pressure on farmers to sell their produce in panic immediately after harvests when prices are normally low. Thus, it may ensure a better return to farmers for their financial and physical investment and also help stabilise market prices. The system may also reduce post-harvest losses as care of the stored commodity is handed over to certified warehouses equipped with the required facilities and expertise.

If run professionally and efficiently, it may reduce pressure on farmers to sell their produce in panic immediately after harvests when prices are normally low while allowing agriculture commodities to be used as collateral for bank loans

However, the insufficient number of certified warehouses complying with preservation norms, lack of awareness among farmers and their limited business skills, and no incentives for buyers to purchase commodities from the warehouses are identified as the stumbling blocks in the expansion of the system.
Afaq Tiwana, a progressive farmer, says the EWR may be beneficial for the community only if the SBP scheme includes a blueprint for bridging the infrastructure (warehouses and logistics) gap. “There is an acute shortage of certified warehouses and reliable logistic facilities that are required to run the system satisfactorily.” He advocates for incentivising the infrastructure building by assuring business for the owners of the storage units the whole year so that they are attracted to invest more and more in the sector.
For this purpose, he argues, the government needs to get out of the business of wheat, the biggest crop of the country. The government is the major player in the wheat market but does not utilise private warehouses depriving them of around six-month business, he says. A mix of wheat, rice and maize crops, etc will ensure the warehouses do business throughout the year because of their different seasons. Mr Tiwana says for food security the government may buy grain from the warehouses if and when required through bidding.
Ibad Khan, president of Guava Growers Association, endorses the views saying by opting for the private warehousing system the government may save non-development expenditures worth billions of rupees consumed by thousands of Food Department employees in the name of salaries and perks, operating costs of their vehicles and buildings, etc “without doing any good”.
“The (provincial) government may buy four million tonnes of wheat from the certified warehouses through the Pakistan Commodities Exchange and lift the grain when needed from there. It will equal a surplus of thousands of food department employees and thus save huge funds required for the functioning of the department, as well as the hassle of checking theft of the crop from its storages by unscrupulous staff.”
Mr Khan thinks the farm produce warehousing concept may gain currency provided the farming community is given proper awareness and the purpose is well served easily by engaging the Agriculture Department’s field staff. “If a farmer learns that by spending Rs50, for instance, as storage rent, his produce will earn Rs100 then he will automatically turn towards the EWR scheme. The extension wing of the Agriculture Department is in close proximity to the rural population and may help mobilise them for it.”
An attractive package to build high-quality warehouses can find 15 to 20 investors in each village ready to build the storage if provided information/guidance about the business scope and initial technical assistance in running the facilities until these become self-sufficient, he asserts.
While the functioning of the facility will benefit the farming community in many ways, Mr Tiwana says the prevailing farm produce trade system is built to make the rich richer. “At present 70 to 80 per cent of commodities are sold at harvesting time in the country. And thus, these fetch lower rates for the farmers. Large processors and the influential (textile, feed, flour millers, etc) have huge amounts of cash at hand and make these purchases knowing that the prices will shoot up within months. Besides value-addition through their mills, they also earn a big profit through commodities trade, robbing millions of farmers of the money that actually belongs to them.”
The EWR facility will save the poor farmers from panic selling as well as stabilise prices in the open market at harvesting time because an adequate quantity of the produce would have been deposited with the warehouses, freeing the market from surplus crops. This would ensure a better return even for those farmers who will be opting to sell their produce in the spot market, he adds.
Mr Khan stresses that the warehousing concept must be linked to the Commodities Exchange for the sake of the sustainability of the system and that the Exchange should be relocated to Punjab, the largest producer of agricultural products so that those involved in active farming have easy access to it. He laments that no farmer association was engaged by the SBP or any other government entity to seek their input for the scheme.
For Amer Hayat Bhandara, a progressive grower from Pakpattan, the EWR facility seems to be working only for those farmers and final buyers who are qualified customers of commercial banks. He points out that one of the most common problems of the farmer is informal debt: farmers take loans from people in the market with personal guarantees and with a condition that the crop will be sold through them.
Will the middlemen allow the farmer to go for the EWR, he questions? Suppose if farmers want to do so, then the debt of the middleman will be repaid through EWR, but how will the inputs like seeds, fertilisers, fuel and pesticides for the next crop be acquired?

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Business leaders and sleepless nights,It’s time to lie low as there is no chance of any clarity till the no-confidence move is over.,"


 
THE critical domains of the economy and foreign affairs have taken a back seat as the political leadership has been left to scramble for continuing in power. This seems to be rather dicey in a world that is trying to deal with fragile energy markets and food security in its Covid-battered existence, and global peace in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
In addition to tales of human sufferings, the war has disturbed global commodity markets, disrupted supply chains, hiked freight charges and posed challenges to the global financial system after the West slapped harsh sanctions on Russia and excluded it from the SWIFT system of money transfers. Experts and economists have predicted slower growth and an increase in inflation worldwide.   
Instead of strategising to deal with the evolving global challenges, Islamabad appears to be too busy to care. Global experts have included Pakistan amongst the more vulnerable nations where the impact of the fallout of war is expected to be severe owing to the resource-deficient country’s dependence on oil, gas and edible imports.

It’s time to lie low as there is no chance of any clarity till the no-confidence move is over

Just as the masses are doing, businesses are also watching closely the events unfolding at a bewildering pace under the full glare of the media spotlight. With the final outcome not quite certain, the whole saga is keeping business houses unnerved.
The common man is desperately waiting for the debilitating economic stress to ease off to the extent that it possibly can, while the business class is dreading a hostile reaction of the West to the hard stance of the government towards the US and Europe. The handshake images of Prime Minister Imran Khan and President Putin in Moscow on the day Russia launched its attack on Ukraine has already placed the country in an awkward position. 
Some like to project the current situation in Pakistan as the expected manifestation of civil unrest over inflation and job losses, while others link it to be the outcome of deeper structural imbalance. And then there are those who see the struggle rooted in efforts to uphold the supremacy of civilian leadership. 
Argumentative Pakistanis can debate the politics, but they all agree that the economy and its challenges have taken a back seat for now and things will be difficult irrespective of the final outcome of the no-confidence motion in parliament.
The leading lights of business class, when approached for a comment, were evasive. Afraid to land on the wrong side of the current or the future set of rulers, they shared their disappointment with the political class privately, saying it was frustrating to watch the politicians “stoop too low whenever tested”. 
A senior business leader commented” “Prime Minister Imran Khan and his confidants are inciting violence much like Trump did in the US. How can they not understand the consequences? If politicians fail to resist the temptation to take their conflict out of parliament it can make the country drift towards anarchy. Yes, we are worried for our businesses, but we are more concerned about the safety and security of our family and the future of this country.” 
Musadaq Zulqarnain, of Interloop fame, believed that “irrespective of the outcome of the vote in parliament or the movement on the streets, the economy is not in a good shape. It will get worse because of political turbulence which will be followed by popular measures to please the masses without fundamental corrections. 
“Pakistan needs a sustained growth of 7-8 per cent for several years, powered by an increase in exports if it wants to come out of its economic troubles. The only solution is a consensus document — the Charter of Economy — which must be vigorously followed irrespective of the party in power,” he said.
Nasser Hayat Magoon, former president of the Federation of Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), said the troubles had aggravated in the last couple of years. The budget, he thought, has failed to spark much interest among the legislators. In his opinion, it is influenced by “a select group of businessmen that encircles the leadership”. 
Sources in the Ministry of Finance told Dawn that the budget exercise initiated in January has been in progress at the routine pace. 
Pulling out his wish-list, Mr Magnoon said: “The FPCCI suggested simplification of taxation, which was promised but was resisted by the tax bureaucracy. We do not expect a business-friendly budget. The timing of the budget will be contingent on how the present chaotic political situation settles.” 
He said the private sector needs to communicate with political parties and sensitise them to the variety of problems that are being faced by businesses. He warned that street agitation in the current charged environment may have serious consequences. 
Mian Anjum Nisar, another business leader, lamented the lack of clarity in politics, while Majyd Aziz was critical of mismatched priorities of successive governments. 
Regardless of the concerns voiced by the business community, everybody realises that at least in the short term, there is no chance of any clarity till the no-confidence move is over.

2022-07-27,2022-03-21,Auto parts — setting a new record for imports,New entrants are rolling out vehicles with mere 5pc locally made parts which is insufficient to reduce foreign exchange burden.,"Pakistan’s import bill for completely and semi-knocked down (CKD/SKD) kits for cars imported by local assemblers has crossed one billion dollars in just eight months of 2021-22 which is significantly higher than the record high bill of $1.12 billion for the entire of FY21.
The 8MFY22 ended with $1.102bn as compared to $557 million in the same period last fiscal. 
The low levels of localisation by Chinese and Korean investors under Auto Policy 2016-2021 for five years as well as in the new models by existing assemblers have played a key role in boosting the import bill.
As per data of the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the new and old entrants brought CKD/SKD kits worth $4.987bn from 2016-2017 to July-February 2021-2022, thus nullifying claims of achieving higher localisation.
Sources said that the new entrants have started rolling out vehicles from their assembly lines with a mere five per cent locally made parts which is insufficient to reduce the burden on the foreign exchange. 

New entrants are rolling out vehicles with mere five per cent locally made parts which is insufficient to reduce the burden on the foreign exchange rate

Assemblers are now in top gear as the eight months of FY22 ended with a whooping sales jump of 57.5pc in cars to 149,813 units. They are also excited over huge bookings in hands whose delivery time ranges between three months to 11 months. Jeeps and pickups sales have also surged by 51.5pc in 8MFY22 to 28,437 units.
Huge demand for cars has led to a massive jump in CKD/SKD imports to $1.120bn in FY21 from $478mn in FY20, up by 134pc thanks to low-interest rates and attractive auto financing by the banks till the third quarter of 2021
However, curbs on auto financing from the last quarter of 2021, persistent increase in car prices and long delays in delivery appear to have not hurt the buyers’ sentiments in the last eight months, while buyers are also satisfied over the rising resale value of the vehicles owing to months’ long delivery timings, soaring prices and on-money for vehicles for immediate delivery. 
The import bill of CKD/SKD was $660m in FY17 which later swelled to $809m in FY18 and then remained at $818mn in FY19. The fiscal year 2019-2020 was a bad year for the entire country due to the flare-up in Covid-19 from March to June followed by the government’s decision to close down the industrial units in April 2020. As a result, the FY20 import bill of CKD/SKD was just $478m.
Stakeholders had been trumpeting 70pc localisation in Suzuki Mehran which ruled the roads for over 30 years without significant model change. After the end of the iconic Mehran journey in 2018, the claim of achieving higher localisation by stakeholders has now been confined to 55-60pc in various existing Japanese models and 35-45pc in new models. 
It seems that no serious efforts have been made by the existing Japanese assemblers in the old and new models to improve the utilisation levels  of locally made parts in vehicles.
A vendor, who asked not to be named, said the import bill of CKD/SKD would remain under pressure as the new entrants, who had approved their projects under the Auto Policy 2016-2021, would enjoy a honeymoon period for the next four to five years to keep rolling out vehicles with negligible local content. Besides, new models by the existing Japanese assemblers will also take time in improving local content in the vehicles.
He said vendors had asked the government not to allow vehicles’ assembly of higher engine power under tAuto Policy 2016-2021. The new entrants, instead of introducing small cars below 800cc, shifted their focus towards the assembly of high engine power sports utility vehicles (SUV) whose numbers are growing every day.
Chief Operating Officer, Balochistan Wheel Limited (BWL), Muhammad Irfan Ghani in a letter to the CEO Engineering Development Board (EDB) said the EDB is the custodian of the auto vending industry which encourages the localisation of auto parts.
The auto sector in Pakistan is now more than 50 years old but the assemblers have not done localisation seriously, he complained.
He said the pace of localisation of auto parts is too slow due to the discouraging attitudes and lengthy procedures adopted by the assemblers which form a monopoly for their foreign principals. They protect their own interests to use their CKD parts and have made localisation very  difficult. 
Mr Ghani said the country’s precious foreign exchange is being wasted due to non-localisation while many assemblers are not taking parts from the local vendors in some of their newly launched models.
The matter came up for discussion during the first meeting of the Auto Industry Development and Export Committee (AIDEC) held on March 8, 2022, which was attended by the auto stakeholders and officials of the relevant ministries. The AIDEC meeting had decided that the EDB would schedule a joint meeting between Baluchistan Wheels and Pak Suzuki to resolve the matter.
However, AIDEC committee members reiterated that the localisation of parts and components must be pursued in letter and spirit. 
Former Chairman Pakistan Association of Parts and Accessories Manufacturers (Paapam), Abdul Rahman Aizaz attributed the rising import bill of CKD to the massive revival in sales of cars and SUVs from the depressed sales scenario of 2019-2020.
Under Auto Policy 2016-2021, most of the new entrants have focused on manufacturing SUVs, which too has resulted in the higher value of CKD imports. He said that sales volumes of new entrants and old players have shown phenomenal growth due to improving economic indicators.
Since the new entrants under Auto Policy 2016-21 can avail the concession on import of CKD for five years, localisation of parts in such vehicles, especially of SUVs, is in the catching-up phase, he added.
Mr Aizaz said that the unprecedented surge in international prices of various resins and metals, rupee devaluation against the dollar and multiple times higher freight charges have further enhanced the landed cost of almost all raw materials.

2022-02-27,2022-03-21,Surviving tough times,"Regardless of who wins and who loses the no-trust motion, the government will not find it easy to handle the economy.","The rupee hit its lowest ever of over 180 to a dollar in the interbank market on the weekend as the shares market continues to decline. 
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) appears largely satisfied with the PTI government’s explanation of the Rs346 billion relief package announced late last month in an apparent attempt to appease the inflation-stricken households. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) kept the key policy rate unchanged at 9.75 per cent but its warning that it could advance the next Monetary Policy Committee meeting to raise the interest rates if need be has pushed cut-off yields in the last public sector debt auction.
The political instability in the wake of a no-confidence motion submitted by the opposition to oust the prime minister is forcing the government to take populist measures that it might not have if it weren’t facing the existential threat from the opposition political parties that have come together to push Imran Khan out of power in spite of their deep divisions. 

Regardless of who wins and who loses the no-trust motion, the government will not find it easy to handle the economy — many hard decisions will have to be made

No one expected the Kaptaan to go away without fighting till the last ball, but the last week’s events in Islamabad have spawned fears of violence. The storming of the Parliament Lodges, where the opposition lawmakers were housed by police commandos and counter-terrorism force was followed by the attack of the PTI workers on Sindh House in Islamabad. It happened after the opposition gave media access to the place to interview dissident parliamentarians of the ruling party. 
The ruling party’s insistence to gather a million people outside the parliament in the event of the vote on the no-confidence resolution and the threats being tossed around by the ministers has forced the opposition political parties to make their own plans to counter the move. Indeed, everyone expected the prime minister to fight back — but not in this way. 
The situation is fluid and may likely continue for several weeks to come, with its impact expected to reverberate for many months. Regardless of who wins and who loses the no-trust motion, the government will not find it easy to handle the economy. Many tough decisions will have to be made. If the opposition succeeds in de-seating the prime minister, it will have its work cut out for them. 
The first job would be to approach the IMF to release the next tranche to shore up foreign exchange reserves and take the pressure off the home currency. PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has already hinted at renegotiating the deal with the multilateral lender. It is not clear if the Washington-based fund would be more kind to the new government than the Imran Khan administration. 
The second job, the businessmen interviewed by telephone over the weekend say, for whoever — the PTI or the opposition parties — is in power after the vote on the motion would be to mend Pakistan’s relationship with the West, especially the United States. “That does not necessarily mean that we have to dial down our ties with China. Going to Russia when the Kremlin had planned to attack Ukraine was a big foreign policy mistake Imran Khan made. He could have called off the tour and stayed neutral. That would not have brought upon us such pressure from the European Union and the US, with which our relations are already facing problems due to the Taleban takeover of Kabul last summer,” a textile exporter argued. 
“Improvement in our ties with Washington and European capitals is crucial not only for securing some concessions from the IMF but also to get out of the grey list of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).”
A senior executive of a chemical company was of the view that once politics cool down Islamabad will have to reconsider its policy towards India. “If you think you can improve your relationship with the West and get off the FATF’s enhanced monitoring regime without making some kind of headway with New Delhi, you are totally mistaken. I have information that our present military leadership too is in favour of resuming ties with India,” he claimed.
However, there are others who feel that the top priority has to be given to the resolution of domestic political problems. “The settlement of the outstanding issues with the IMF and the western powers is important. But more important is to tackle our domestic problems first. I cannot say if the present government will be in power after a few days or not. But in my opinion, once this crisis is over, all the parties must sit together and develop a consensus on electoral reforms so that we can have political stability. I think that the government term of five years should be curtailed to four years. We are very impatient people and a kind of fatigue starts to take over us every three to four years. If we manage to clean up our political mess, we will be able to put back the economy on the rails and end our international isolation.”

2022-03-20,2022-03-21,"IMF seeks details of petrol, power subsidy funding",Finance minister makes it clear there are no more outstanding issues as the IMF only wants to ascertain sources of funding.,"


 
ISLAMABAD: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has sought copies of financial agreements with the provincial governments and other details from the federal government to confirm the financing of discounts on electricity and petroleum products announced by Prime Minister Imran Khan, Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin disclosed at a press conference on Sunday.
The talks with the IMF were earlier scheduled to conclude on Friday last but then “they [Fund staff] wanted to see agreements with the provinces to basically reassure we are not involved in aerial firing” on financing of PM’s relief package for petroleum prices, the minister said.
Mr Tarin made it clear that there were no more outstanding issues, as they only wanted to ascertain the sources of funding to cover the cost of reduction in electricity and petroleum products. They were assured the package would be covered through provincial shares and dividends of the state-owned entities, he said. “They said show us agreements with the provinces,” he remarked.
The federal government has signed rolling memorandums of understanding with the provinces to provide cash surplus every year to show lower consolidated fiscal deficit but are sometimes remain unhonoured when provinces also go into overdrafts.
“So there is no problem. We already have agreements that we will show them” when the two sides would meet again on Monday, the minister said, adding he would hold a final policy round up with the fund mission on Tuesday. 
The two sides will then finalise the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) amicably and take it to the executive board on a convenient date.
After initial compliance with the commitments made with the IMF in December 2021 to increase petroleum levy and power tariff, PM Khan reversed the progress by announcing Rs10 per litre reduction in petroleum products bringing down levy to zero besides a cut in electricity rates by Rs5 per unit instead of a schedule of increases agreed to with the IMF to address circular debt.
Up to 700,000-tonne wheat import
Responding to a question, Mr Tarin said all the provinces were part of the minimum wheat support price at Rs2,200 per 40 kg approved by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet last week — about 13 per cent higher than Rs1,950 of last year and showed confidence to exceed procurement target that was also set at 6.9 million tonnes last week.
He said the wheat production was then estimated to be 5pc to 6pc higher and may not require imports except 500,000 to 700,000 tonnes for strategic reserves. “I would like to increase strategic reserves from 1.8 million tonnes to two million tonnes, depending on international prices,” he said, adding he would not burn foreign exchange if international wheat prices remain higher.
In response to a question about former PML-N finance minister Miftah Ismail’s statement that the country could not launch international bonds as Pakistan’s bond yields had gone high due to economic policies and fundamentals, Mr Tarin said his statement would not change ground reality. This was not Pakistan specific but with entire developing countries including Turkey, Indonesia and others, he remarked.
Mr Tarin said financing was not an issue but the interest rates being offered were higher. He said he still had $4-5bn worth of offers from banks, but “why should I take expensive loans?” Mr Miftah should also recall they had left the government with just one-month import financing that now stood at $16.6bn – against average monthly imports of about $7bn in eight months, he added.
Responding to a question whether he would continue as finance minister in the next government if asked, Mr Tarin said he was a man of principles and would at no cost do that as he was a PTI senator. “I will remain finance minister if the PTI government stays, otherwise will go home. I am not a renegade,” he said.
He expressed the hope that 5pc economic growth rate was expected despite various headwinds this year, as some sectors were also showing robust growth including large-scale manufacturing, agriculture and exports. “This shows there is thrust in the economy and momentum is returning,” he said, adding that this did not mean there were no headwinds but policy adjustments would continue to absorb them.
“The welcome news is that the LSM has grown by 8.2pc in January against same month of last year and 4.2pc against December 2021,” he said, adding the LSM growth had slowed down in August and September 2021 but the trend had reversed. “Our economic growth momentum has picked up again as all agriculture crops are growing at 6 to 12 percent, and exports and services sectors are also growing at a high pace,” the minister pointed out.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,NA speaker summons no-trust session on 25th,"Government to file reference in SC today to end politics of ""sale and purchase"".","ISLAMABAD: In an apparent move to prolong the voting on a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan, National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser on Sunday summoned the session of the lower house of parliament on March 25, violating the Constitution under which he is bound to convene a session within 14 days after the submission of a requisition. 
Meanwhile, the government also took a significant decision under which it will file a reference in the Supreme Court on Monday (today), seeking “an opinion” of the apex court on two main points — whether the disqualification of a legislator is for life time and whether the dissident MNAs of any party can cast vote on a no-confidence resolution. 
The speaker, who under the Constitution was bound to call the NA session by March 21 [within 14 days after the opposition’s requisition], gave an excuse that since the three-day conference of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) would be held in the NA hall, there was no other place in the federal capital to convene the NA session. 
This is despite the fact that the capital offers alternative locations where such an event can be held such as the spacious Jinnah Convention Centre, Prime Minister Secretariat, Pak-China Centre, two five-star hotels, etc. 

Government to file reference in SC today to end politics of ‘sale and purchase’

The opposition lashed out at the speaker for his decision to hold the NA session on March 25, saying he had violated the Constitution to prolong the voting on no-trust motion. 
Sources in the government told Dawn that the decisions to hold the NA session on March 25 and filing of the reference in the Supreme Court were taken at a meeting presided over by Prime Minister Khan at his Banigala residence on Sunday. 
Speaker Asad Qaiser issued an order saying the [opposition’s] requisition was received on March 8 for summoning the National Assembly. Whereas, on Jan 21, 2022, a motion had been adopted by the NA to allow the exclusive use of NA chamber for the 48th session of the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers scheduled for March 22, 23 or any other date. 
He said the renovation work on the NA chamber and its lobbies had commenced on the requirement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the end of February 2022, which was under taken by the Capital Development Authority. 
The speaker said that after the receipt of [the opposition’s] requisition, the NA Secretariat requested the Senate Secretariat to provide chamber of the Senate for holding the NA session, but the latter pointed out that the Senate chamber was also not available for being under renovation. 
“Thereafter, the CDA chairman and deputy commissioner, Islamabad, were also approached to arrange and provide a suitable building for holding the session of the National Assembly outside the parliament building, at Islamabad. However, they have informed in writing that no suitable place is available at present in Islamabad for holding the NA session,” Mr Qaisar added. 
“In view of the aforementioned facts and circumstances, it is evident that no suitable place would be available for holding the session of the NA till March 24. Having no adequate option available whatsoever, for holding of the NA session before March 24, therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under clause (3) of Article 54 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, read with Article 254 of the Constitution, I hereby summon the session of the National Assembly on the first available date i.e. Friday, March 25 at 11.00am at the Parliament House, Islamabad,” the order said. 
Meanwhile, Planning and Development Minister Asad Umar said in a tweet that the government would file a reference in the Supreme Court that would end the politics of “sell and purchase” and diminish the influence of “easy money” and “influence in politics”. 



 
When contacted, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said the decision to file the reference was taken by the prime minister in a meeting on Sunday. “The basic reasons of filing the reference are — to know whether the disqualification of any legislators is for lifetime and that can PTI dissidents cast vote on the no-trust motion,” he added. 
A source said the NA speaker could call the session on March 21 to meet the constitutional requirement [within 14 days after the requisition] and adjourn the session for three days for the OIC conference and it could resume on March 24. 
According to Article 63 of the Constitution, the prime minister is given three days after the tabling of a no-trust motion, for preparation. However, the government is apparently trying to linger on the voting on the motion — first by an excuse of “lack of suitable place for the session till March 25” and then filing of the reference in the Supreme Court. 
The information minister said the government was only seeking an opinion of the apex court and it could be given by the court even on the first day of filing of the reference or the court could take more time it deemed appropriate. 
Asked why the NA session was not called on March 21, he said the NA hall was not available for the session due to the OIC summit.

The opposition parties also lashed out at the PM for, what they called, using the religion card in an effort to save his government and accused his party of launching a ‘propaganda campaign’ through its social media team against the army over its ‘neutrality’.
Speaking at a news conference, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari expressed the hope that the Supreme Court would take notice of the violation of the Constitution by the speaker, proving that there was at least one institution in the country for the protection of the Constitution, democracy and right of the vote of the parliamentarians. 
Stating that the job of the SC was to protect and implement the Constitution, the PPP chairman hoped that the court “will not facilitate this government on its unconstitutional step” and that it would make a constitutional decision, not a political one. 

PTI accused of running social media campaign against army; PML-Q wants PM to take notice of ‘anti-Pakistan’ drive

“We appreciate how the SC sent a message of standing with the law and Constitution, even on a weekend,” he said in an apparent reference to the hearing of a petition of the Supreme Court Bar Association during which the court had reprimanded the government over the attack by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) activists on Sindh House. 
He said the SC was already hearing a petition that had not been filed by them, but the bar association. However, he said the court had issued notices to the political parties as well in the case and they would present their viewpoint before it. 
“This coward captain [the PM] is running away from the vote of no confidence. He is escaping to the extent that he has made the speaker abrogate the Constitution,” the PPP chairman observed. 
Mr Bhutto-Zardari lashed out at PM Khan for using Islam for party politics and asked him not to use the slogan of Madinah state. 
“You (the PM) are the foreign-sponsored and foreign-funded agent who has been planted in our system,” he said while criticising the government’s foreign policy. He alleged that the prime minister had been given the task to damage the country’s foreign policy and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and that he had done it “beautifully”. 
He accused Mr Khan of adopting the foreign policy of India, stating that there was no difference in the foreign policies of the two countries. 
Addressing a separate news conference, PML-N’s senior vice-president Shahid Khaqan Abbasi also accused the speaker and the premier of violating the Constitution and committing treason under Article 6 which, he said, was not a joke. He said if anyone would interfere in the democratic process of no-trust move, he would commit ‘treason’. 
PML-N secretary general Ahsan Iqbal alleged that Mr Khan was using religion card to cover up his “dirty politics and incompetence”. 
Earlier, in a statement, PML-N information secretary Marriyum Aurangzeb stated if the speaker failed to convene the NA session before March 22, he would be guilty of violating the Constitution that was be punishable under Article 6. 
Campaign against institutions
During the news conference, the PPP chairman also alleged that the PM and his social media team had launched a ‘propaganda campaign’ to ‘provoke’ an institution so that it could not remain ‘neutral’. 
“When a time has come when the media is talking about a neutral environment, Imran and his social media team are trying to spread the propaganda that institutions are not neutral, be it through provocation or creating a constitutional crisis,” he said.
“It is the responsibility of all of us to demand and try for every institution to work within its domain drawn by the law and Constitution, and to criticise when this does not happen. However, it is also our responsibility to oppose the prime minister, his social media team and its members who are provoking and targeting an institution under a conspiracy,” he added.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari said the prime minister had equated the term ‘neutral’ with animals and had still not apologised to the nation over it. “Our efforts have always been for neutrality. The PM, his social media team and ministers are making desperate attempts to tarnish neutrality. We condemn this,” he said without elaborating.
The PPP chairman, who had not named the institution during his press conference, later asked the Inter-Service Public Relations and the judiciary to take notice of the propaganda campaign by the PM, his social media team and the MNAs aimed at getting “the status of neutrality” changed.
Though Mr Bhutto-Zardari did not give any reference to the army when he talked about the allegation regarding the propaganda campaign against neutrality, the PML-Q and the PML-N came out more openly when they castigated the PTI government for hitting out at army and Inter-Service Intelligence by a party’s woman MNA and an important member of the PTI’s media team. 
A video clip with the audio of PTI MNA Kanwal Shauzeb shared from a twitter space “Current political situation” went viral on social media in which she could be heard apparently talking about military establishment. “They have nothing to do with performance and neither they want to manage the country. They had never done it in the past, then why will they do it now. Actually, they wanted to hijack the system and working on an agenda of minus-Imran Khan,” she said in the clip, adding that the real issue was that the premier was not allowing those sitting in “different institutions and all kinds of institutions to continue their loot and plunder” and “that’s why they are now having panic attacks”.
Since Saturday afternoon, an unusual debate has started on Twitter with a host of people, apparently the PTI supporters, trying to make the army leadership controversial by levelling all kinds of accusations. They were found accusing the army chief of trying to undermine the government and the present system. 
In response, several people also came out in support of the armed forces, blaming the present government of maligning the armed forces and its chief.
Reacting over the clip, PML-Q MNA Chaudhry Salik Hussain tweeted: “The PTI’s social media team and a woman MNA levelled false allegations on the Pakistan Army and the ISI, which are unacceptable and unbearable.” 
Mr Hussain demanded that the PM must take notice of this “dirty anti-Pakistan campaign, otherwise, the PML-Q knew well how to deal with the anti-Pakistan elements”.



 
Also, the official spokesman for PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif, Malik Ahmad Khan, tweeted that the PTI social media team would not be allowed to defame the Pakistan Army. “The state’s existence gets threatened when a state army’s central authority is compromised,” he said. 



 
“When a state will not respect the status of the institution of army, can a state survive?” he asked in a linked tweet. “The strong army is a guarantor of strong Pakistan,” the spokesman said, adding that every Pakistani was ready to sacrifice his life for country’s solidarity and progress.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Jahangir Tareen group sees their demands being met,A senior party leader in Punjab says the PM has agreed to remove CM Buzdar but wants the dissident group to wait for a while.,"LAHORE: Members of the dissident Jahangir Tareen group in the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) appear confident they will have their way after securing guarantees that the chief minister of Punjab will be removed from office.
Sources in the group told Dawn that Prime Minister Imran Khan had all but “agreed” to accept the demands of the dissident group, but has sought more time to remove Chief Minister Usman Buzdar in order to “avert the impression of being blackmailed”.
Shaken by a no-confidence motion against the premier, the PTI government is on a mission to mend ways with party dissidents. A senior delegation of government members met the Jahangir Tareen group and asked them to explain their concerns and demands in detail.
“The Tareen group remains adamant over the removal of Usman Buzdar and explained their concerns with regards to victimisation, lukewarm response from Chief Minister Office to their problems and the bureaucracy’s attitude towards their group members,” a source in the Tareen group told Dawn.
A senior party leader in Punjab told Dawn the prime minister had agreed to remove CM Buzdar but wanted the dissident group to wait for a while, because an immediate acceptance of the demand would be exploited by the opposition as if “Imran Khan has bowed down to dissidents’ blackmail”.
The PTI government had also conveyed that the new chief minister would be from PTI parliamentarians, the senior party leader said, adding that the Tareen group assured the government team that it did not want to leave the party until it would be compelled to do so.
Problems being resolved
Meanwhile, key Tareen group member Lala Tahir Randhawa said a government team led by cabinet minister Murad Raas had called on the group and agreed to resolve problems that could be addressed through the administration.
Since the government team had been given two days to resolve the parliamentarians’ issue, Mr Randhawa said a response had started to come, as deputy commissioners, district police officers and other government officials were calling all group members to address their problems.
He said that actions taken to victimise him and provincial minister Ajmal Cheema were also being undone. “The government team will return with its problems’ resolution report and the group will meet on Wednesday to take a final decision,” he added.
Mr Randhawa asserted that the group’s main demand was “minus-Buzdar” because the incumbent chief minister had ruined the governance system in the country. “Another large group of MPAs have also contacted the Tareen group and expressed support for its demand of removing Buzdar from Punjab’s chief ministership,” Mr Randhawa revealed.
Answering a question about PTI dissident and former senior minister Abdul Aleem Khan’s conduct with the group after visiting it at Jahangir Tareen’s residence, Mr Randhawa said Aleem Khan did come and a five-member committee was constituted — including Mr Randhawa, Nauman Langrial, Abdul Hayee Dasti and Ajmal Cheema — to coordinate with Aleem Khan. However, Aleem Khan did not call the committee and he alone met Sindh Governor Imran Ismail, who visited him on the instructions of the prime minister.
Sources said the government had conveyed to the Tareen group that CM Buzdar would be replaced by another senior leader within the party and four names have started doing the rounds in the PTI parliamentarians’ circle, including those of provincial minister Raja Yasir Humayun, Murad Raas, Mian Aslam Iqbal and Asif Nakai.
Tareen group members told Dawn that 13 of their 17 MPAs were elected as independents and later joined the party. “Even if the Tareen group decided to vote against PM Imran Khan in the centre and CM Buzdar in Punjab, the government would not be able to de-seat them because they were not elected on PTI tickets,” Mr Randhawa told Dawn.
Tareen ‘held party together’
Meanwhile, Jahangir Tareen’s spokesman Awn Chaudhry said some eight MNAs were standing with the group and take a decision about supporting or not supporting the government in the opposition’s no-confidence motion.
“I was personally disturbed when I saw that several MNAs stood against the party,” he said and added that it all happened because PM Khan pushed away Jahangir Tareen, who was actually keeping all MNAs intact with the party.
“Mr Tareen used to help the prime minister in difficult times and resolve party parliamentarians’ problems,” he said and asked whether the PTI should not hold the premier’s political aides accountable for all this mess.
Answering a question whether Jahangir Tareen could enter into any deal with the PML-N, he said he could not comment on his leader’s behalf. “Whatever Jahangir Tareen will decide, his whole group will go along his decision,” he asserted.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,RED ZONE FILES: All set for a collision course,Some govt officials have started to acknowledge in private that prospects of surviving this challenge from opposition are slim.,"Political entanglements may once again be headed to the courts. 
Speaker Asad Qaiser has summoned the crucial session of the National Assembly on Friday, March 25, which is three days longer than the Constitution has stipulated once the required number of parliamentarians have requisitioned a session. This order further complicates a situation that is fraught with danger and uncertainty. Here’s where things stand today and what they could portend in the coming days:

The PTI government is doing legal gymnastics with constitutional procedures, but there is no way around the vote of no-confidence against Prime Minister Imran Khan. The only way that the PM can retain his job is if the opposition fails to muster a strength of 172 in the lower house during the vote. Or if for some reason, the opposition withdraws the motion. There is no other way out for the PM and his cabinet. Legal experts say the speaker may attempt to delay the process and push the vote forward, and this may ultimately end up in courts, but the vote will need to take place one way or another. What matters is the numbers game. Everything else is a side show.
The courts may in fact become the battleground before the real battle on the floor of the National Assembly. If both the government and the opposition head to the Supreme Court with their petitions, the court may need to pronounce on the following: (i) if Article 63 of the constitution allows the party head to stop errant members of his party from voting on the confidence motion (ii) if the disqualification under Article 3 for members indulging in floor crossing can be a lifetime ban (iii) if the speaker can delay summoning of the National Assembly for more than the two-week limit spelt out in the Constitution and whether he can somehow delay the moving of the motion for the vote of no confidence. 
These issues will be addressed by the Supreme Court this week and a lot will depend on how long the SC takes to pronounce a decision. According to legal experts, if the SC reaffirms the obvious interpretation of the constitutional procedure for the vote of no-confidence, then the government will have no other option but to fight the numbers game, which it appears to be losing at this stage.
The planned rallies by the government and the opposition on Sunday, March 27, have added an explosive element to the volatile situation. Inside the Red Zone, there is a genuine fear that if these rallies are allowed to take place as scheduled, then there is a danger of violence breaking out. Now, imagine the real danger: when such violence ensues between a sitting government and its opponents, what does the police do? And if the police cannot handle such a scenario, the only option is what Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid has been referring to in his speeches: handing over security responsibility to the armed forces.
There is no need for the situation to deteriorate to such a level. But it is being dragged towards such an outcome by the government itself. What is otherwise a straightforward constitutional procedure is being weaponised by the use of mobs and threats. These in turn are being used to fuel a new narrative that focuses on accusations of horse-trading as a means to undermine a democratic process. What is being deliberately ignored is that such allegations need to be proved in a court of law for any action to be taken. They are handy for political sloganeering but cannot be used to counter what is purely a constitutional and legal process.
The government allies have stitched up their agreements with the opposition but according to Red Zone insiders, they will hold back formal announcements till after the OIC foreign ministers’ meeting. Despite the ups and downs of this week and the increase in political temperatures, the PML-Q, MQM and BAP are still locked into an understanding whose final details are being stitched up. One parliamentarian from the allied parties said their decision was intact as per the understanding reached.
One key challenge for the opposition is to keep its members safe, secure and available in Islamabad. This has led to daily congregations for dinners where the leaders keep an eye on their flock while also ensuring that none are under any pressure or facing threats. Opposition insiders say this is harder than it sounds as these elected members have a strong gravitational pull from their constituencies and yet cannot be allowed to disperse from Islamabad at a crucial time when every single vote counts.
While it is clear that the vote of no confidence will take place in a matter of days, there remain some uncertainties that are becoming a source of concern: (i) if PM Khan is on a collision course – as is evident from his speeches, including the one on Sunday – is there a way the system can be saved from instability without the opposition ceding space to him? (ii) Will the establishment be forced to intervene if matters start to spin out of control (iii) what will happen if the PM decides to use the ‘nuclear option’ of firing a senior official and appointing a new one in his place?
Some senior government officials have started to acknowledge in private that their prospects of surviving this challenge from the opposition are slim. They are now also admitting that the root cause of the dire situation they find themselves in today is the unnecessary and avoidable confrontation with the establishment. 
Yet they are now locked into a predicament that can only reinforce itself if the PTI government falls. The narrative being stitched together by the party leadership will likely further accentuate the source of the conflict and could trigger greater political instability.

The Red Zone is under stress. The coming ten days will determine if it can sustain it.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Cases of femicide rising sharply in Iraqi Kurdistan,11 women were killed in the first two months of this year...,"SULAIMANIYAH: A woman burned alive by her husband, others shot dead by a father or a teenage brother — bloody violence against women has spiked in northern Iraq’s Kurdish region.
The autonomous area, keen on projecting an image of a relative haven of stability and tolerance in war-battered Iraq, has seen a sharp rise in femicide, killings motivated by gender.
“In the past two months, there has been an increase in femicide compared to the previous year,” said Hiwa Karim Jwamir of the Kurdish General Directorate for Combating Violence Against Women.
In the first two months of 2022, 11 women were killed in autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan, most of them shot, said the official based in Sulaimaniyah.
Forty-five women were killed in 2021, up from 25 the previous year, said Jwamir.

11 women were killed in the first two months of this year

On a Friday before dawn, a 15-year-old teenager was fatally wounded by six bullets fired by her father in the village of Soran. The man told police his daughter “went out with two boys late at night”, according to a domestic violence unit which also records so-called “honour killings”.
Across Iraq, gender-based violence rose 125 per cent to over 22,000 cases between 2020 and 2021, says the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund, which has also pointed to “a worrisome increase in depression and suicide among women and girls”. Last December, a 16-year-old girl was disfigured with acid in Baghdad by an adult who wanted to marry her but had been rejected.
For years, activists have denounced violence against women and forced marriages in Iraq, which remains a conservative and patriarchal society.
“Cases of violence against women are on the rise,” said long-time Kurdistan activist Bahar Munzir, director of local group the People’s Development Organisation.
“Most of the women who are killed are victims of a family member.”
A few days before International Women’s Day on March 8, the body of a 20-year-old woman was found on the side of the road in Arbil, the capital of Kurdistan.
Maria Sami, the victim, was known on social networks for her feminist speeches.
The following day, on March 9, Kirkuk police announced the arrest of the killer, her 18-year-old brother.
While he was still on the run, he spoke by phone to a Kurdish television channel and tried to justify the killing by charging his sister had failed to obey the family. In February, mother-of-two Shinyar Huner Rafiq died in hospital, five days after being admitted with serious burns.
“Her husband had come home one evening in a state of intoxication,” Shinyar’s father, Huner Rafiq, told AFP.
“He doused her body in gasoline and set it on fire.” After the father reported the killing, police arrested the husband. “Before dying, Shinyar told us the facts,” said the bereaved father. “We recorded it, and we submitted the video to the investigators.”
Kurdistan’s prime minister Masrour Barzani denounced the “horrific case”, saying he was “deeply troubled” by the spate of violent attacks against women.
The government must impose “the heaviest possible penalty on perpetrators”, he said in a statement.
“There is no honour in honour killings. I’m determined to protect every woman, girl and child from abuse ... This scourge must end.”
In early February, Dohuk police said they had found the corpse of Doski Azad, a 23-year-old transgender woman who had been ostracised by family members.
An arrest warrant was issued to find the suspected murderer: the victim’s brother, who had in recent years been living in Europe.
He had called his family to inform them of his crime and of where the body was, according to police.
The murder was condemned by the UN mission in Iraq, and the consulates of Western countries in Arbil.
The news provoked a torrent of hatred online — against the victim, even though some voices defended minorities’ rights.
In June 2011, Kurdistan passed a law criminalising domestic violence and female genital mutilation.
The law, which threatens life in prison for “honour” crimes, was hailed by non-governmental groups as a major step forward. But the law’s enforcement is hampered by a climate of impunity and a common fear of speaking out.
“When a woman is killed, the procedures of the security services are not the same as when it’s a man, the trial is not the same,” said Munzir, the activist.
“Some cases don’t even make it to court. They are subject to tribal resolution between the man’s family and that of his wife, the victim.“

2022-01-12,2022-03-21,Committee set up to identify officers involved in leasing out Monal Restaurant,"Body asked to assess the transparency of bidding process, comparison of rent rates offered by the lease.","ISLAMABAD: A four-member committee has been formed by the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to identify officers who were involved in processing and leasing out Monal Restaurant and other buildings in the protected area of Margalla Hills National Park (MHNP). 
This has been done in compliance with the orders of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Jan 12, 2022. According to a notification issued by the CDA’s Confidential Wing, the committee is supposed to complete its task within 15 days “so that disciplinary proceedings could be initiated against the delinquent officers/officials”.
Sources in the wing said Deputy Director General Land and Estate Afnan Alam would head the committee while Deputy Financial Adviser Khawaja Aizad Hussain, Director Laboratory Khalid Nawaz and Director Regional Planning Fraz Malik will be its members.

Body asked to assess transparency of bidding process, comparison of rent rates offered by the lease and accepted by the then CDA administration

The notification of the committee, which was issued on March 10, and is available with Dawn, tasked the committee to “identify officer involved in processing/leasing of land/structure of Monal Restaurant in the protected area of National Park in violation of the Act of 1997, Ordinance of 1960, Ordinance of 1966, Ordinance of 1979 and the regulations made under the respective statutes”.
According to the terms of reference (TORs), the committee has been given the task to identify factors behind construction of Monal Restaurant and other buildings in the protected area as it was in violation of various acts and ordinances.
The committee has been directed to “assess the transparency of bidding process for leasing of Monal to a private entity and comparison of rent rates offered by the lease and accepted by the then CDA administration with the then market prices for facilities of similar size and nature, identify/mention relevant provision of laws and regulations, infringed while allowing construction/lease of the Monal Resturant and to ascertain the loss/ damages to wildlife, flora and fauna and environmental changes in National Park due to said construction of the restaurant”.
While hearing a petition related to Monal Restaurant, the IHC in January this year had ordered the CDA and Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) to seal the building and start proceedings against other buildings that were operating in the national park in violation of rules.
Following the said orders, the CDA and ICT administration sealed the restaurant.
However, the Supreme Court on March 9, suspended the Jan 11 IHC judgement of sealing and taking over possession of the restaurant.
“The unsigned order of the IHC will remain suspended,” ordered a three-judge Supreme Court bench headed by Justice Ijazul Ahsan. Consequently, Monal Restaurant was de-sealed.
The court, which had taken up the appeal of Monal Group of Companies, pointed out why no action was taken against the other 13 restaurants situated in close proximity of Monal and why Monal was discriminated against only and on what basis, its possession was taken over without the certified copy of the high court.
The IHC had ordered the CDA and IWMB to take over forthwith the possession of the restaurant and seal its premises, subject to allowing its owner/management to take out their property. 
The CDA, after construction of the restaurant, had leased it out to a private firm for 15 years and the lease agreement expired last year. 
However, a few years before the expiry of agreement, the lessee started paying rent to the military, which stated that the land where Monal was constructed belonged to them in accordance with a notification issued in 1912.
IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah rejected the military ownership’s claim over the land and ordered recovery of all the rent paid by the Monal Restaurant management. 
The court had also asked the defence ministry to ensure that the amount received as rent was deposited in the exchequer.
“The claim of Remount, Veterinary and Farms Directorate of Pakistan Army, regarding 8,068 acres of land in the notified national park area is in 
violation of the Ordinance of 1979, read with the Ordinance of 1960, and the [Islamabad] Master Plan,” the IHC had declared.
The IHC chief justice had also directed civic agencies to seal the sprawling naval golf course located in the national park area and unless an environmentally-friendly use can be found for it, ordered its demolition within four weeks.
A senior CDA officer confirmed that the inquiry committee had been formed and added that the committee was yet to hold its first meeting.

The statement of traffic police stated that SSP Rai Mazhar proposed to the Capital Development Authority to make the highway signal free.
The project has saved Rs7.5 billion as instead of constructing overhead bridges, the corridor was made signal free by constructing protected U-turns. 
The data of the police showed that over 115,000 vehicles enter and leave from Islamabad Chowk to Zero Point. As they will travel on the signal-free corridor, it will save around 100,000 man hours of people.
On an average four people travel in a vehicle so if each vehicle saves 15 minutes the entire saving of time of four persons will be one hour, the statement said.
Chief Commissioner Islamabad Amer Ali Ahmed had appreciated the proposal of SSP traffic and directed immediate implementation of the proposal. 
Now the Srinagar Highway has been made signal free by constructing three protective U-turns that connected Islamabad and Rawalpindi with the new airport.
All foreign guests and dignitaries use this road while travelling to and from the airport.
The duration of the travel to Islamabad airport would reduce to half.
This will help solve traffic jam by 60 to 70pc while travelling time to Islamabad airport will also reduce considerably, the SSP (Traffic) said.

2022-03-20,2022-03-21,Islamabad sees decline in Covid-19 mortality rate,Fafen’s findings stress the need for continued vigilance,"ISLAMABAD: As vaccination against Covid-19 has surpassed the figure of 90pc in the federal capital, the city has seen a reduction in mortality rate.
According to data, only 133 cases were reported in the city during the last one week, with the positivity ratio remaining at 1pc. 
On the other hand, Rawalpindi reported five positive cases on Sunday.
In another development, the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) launched a report on Sunday that covered Pakistan’s Covid-19 response during January-February 2022.

Fafen’s findings stress the need for continued vigilance

During the last few weeks, the fifth wave of the pandemic has been losing severity in the country, which can be gauged from the fact that the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) has decided to lift all restrictions for fully-vaccinated people.
Talking to Dawn, District Health Officer Islamabad Dr Zaeem Zia said though the city had surpassed the figure of 90pc, in terms of complete vaccination, it should be considered around 95pc as a number of residents of the city were outside the country.
“The reduced mortality rate shows credibility of vaccination in the city. Despite the fact that Islamabad has a large number of medical tourism, the mortality rate is almost zero,” he added.
While sharing the weekly data, Dr Zia said in the last week of January, the city observed the highest positivity rate of 16.45pc which then gradually started to decline, reaching 1pc during the last week.
The data showed that on Sunday, the capital reported 21 Covid-19 patients and the infection rate of 1.32pc.
Meanwhile,five people tested positive in Rawalpindi district and four recovered during the last 24 hours.
According to the health authority’s data, the positivity ratio in the district was 0.56pc. A total of 892 samples were collected out of which results of 887 people came back negative.
There are 76 active patients in Rawalpindi district as of March 20, with three patients admitted to hospitals and 73 home isolated.
Two patients surfaced from the cantonment areas and one patient each from Kallar Syedan, Taxila and Islamabad. There is no patient on ventilator, however one is on oxygen and the other two are stable.
On the other hand, a report of the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) has observed varying healthcare capacities across regions and districts during the fifth wave of Covid-19 that remained a major challenge and key concern.
With the onset of Omicron variant in December last year, confirmed cases jumped to 133,839 in January – the highest since the start of the pandemic – while the number of recoveries was recorded at 38,366.
Compared to January, cases started to decline in February. The health authorities recorded 79,855 confirmed cases and 147,548 recoveries in the month.
Fafen’s findings of the third pandemic governance monitoring report, released on Sunday, reinforced the need for consistent and continued vigilance and the necessity of both medium and long-term structural and policy changes built on the lessons learnt.
Compared to the earlier waves, the report highlighted a broad two-pronged pandemic response to the fifth surge of Covid-19 that helped Pakistan withstand and manage the challenges relatively well.
The first aspect of the response comprised varying levels of restrictions and targeted measures in areas with high positivity ratio.
The second wave comprised a parallel push for increased vaccination and broadening the eligible population section to include the 12-16 age group. A remarkable increase of 30 million to the fully vaccinated column during the first two months of the ongoing year is a testament to the seriousness accorded to the effort, the report said. 
Despite a slow start, Pakistan’s vaccination drive gained significant momentum, reaching an average of one million doses per day by the end of last year.
Pakistan had administered 216.9 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine by the first week of March 2022. Approximately 100 million people were fully vaccinated (65pc of the vaccine eligible population and 44pc of the total estimated population), whereas around 127.5 million are ‘partially vaccinated’ as per the information provided by the NCOC website and their official twitter account.
As assessed in the report, had the Omicron variant been as severe as the earlier variants, it would have seriously tested the healthcare system — a factor that shall not be lost on policymakers responsible for responding to any new variant of Covid-19 or a completely new pandemic.
For instance, the availability of beds, ventilators and doctors within the observed districts showed that the healthcare system in Pakistan was still under-equipped — more so in some areas than others.
If the situation had necessitated the hospitalisation of those infected, the number of patients per ventilator and patients per bed would have resulted in severe consequences for some of the districts.
For instance, Karak district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa would have 21,132 and 1,023 patients per ventilator and bed respectively, followed by Mardan with 669 patients per ventilator and 324 patients per bed, and Rawalpindi with 204 patients per ventilator and four patients per bed.
The private sector has played a significant role in providing services and facilities that have contributed to the overall pandemic governance and response. However, there remains the need for more effective regulation, especially regarding the pricing of critical services.
However, what remains a key concern for the government is the issue of price regulation.
Attendants of patients interviewed at various health facilities highlighted the significant variance in test pricing. The respondents claimed to have paid prices ranging between Rs1,000 and Rs15,000 or more.

This was said by Minister for Social Welfare and Baitul Mal Syed Yawar Abbas Bukhari during the ground-breaking ceremony of a medical services unit at District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital, Attock district, on Sunday.
The centre would be completed at a cost of Rs10 million next year and would aim to provide medical assistance to poor patients in the province under the administrative supervision of the social welfare department.
The department’s director, Mohammad Shahid, Deputy Director Haseeb Khalid, District Health Authority Chief Executive Dr Jawad Elahi, Medical Social Welfare Officer Hafiz Mohammad Zubair, PTI’s focal person for Attock Khawar Bukhari and other notables of the area were present on the occasion.

Says annual budget for medical social welfare raised from Rs1.3 million to Rs3.8m

Mr Bukhari said the annual budget for the medical social welfare had been raised from Rs1.3 million to Rs3.8 million, adding that the Punjab government had allocated Rs600 million for social welfare centres across the province.
“Besides, special Quran and Braille printers are being provided free-of-cost to differently-abled people. The social welfare department has also issued the Special Persons Act under his supervision which has been appreciated by the high court while measures are being taken for the welfare of transgender persons,” he added.
A sum of Rs45 million had been allocated for the upgradation and enhancement of different training facilities across the province while the sale of products manufactured there also rose to Rs1.2 million during the current fiscal year, he said, adding that the provincial government had allocated Rs231 million for establishment of seven shelter homes in different parts of the province including Dera Ghazi Khan, Bahawalpur, Sargodha, Multan, Faisalabad and Sahiwal. 
He said an educational institute for differently-abled people called ‘Nasheman’ is being inaugurated on March 31, adding that the Mother and Child Care Hospital would be completed at a cost of Rs5 million next fiscal year. 
He said the nursing school would be upgraded to a nursing college so students of the area did not have to travel to other cities. A blood bank will also be set up in the hospital to facilitate thalassemia patients, he added.

Talking to Dawn, the minister said a fully funded Annual Development Programme (ADP) of Rs1.4 billion was approved for the construction of the university campus. He said the project was the joint ownership of the city as locals contributed funds towards raising different buildings.
The foundation of UoC was laid by Prime Minister Imran Khan near Balkasar area two years ago, which is nearing completion, Mr Sarfraz said.
The request for establishment of the city campus was also submitted to the Punjab government so that students of Chakwal city did not travel 16km to Balkasar daily, he said.
The PC-I for the city campus has been approved and Rs1.4 billion allocated for the construction of the campus, the minister said.
“Two academic blocks, an admin block and male and female hostels would be built and renovation carried out with the fund,” the provincial minister said, adding that construction of the city campus would be completed by 2024.
“The Ministry of Higher Education was my favourite portfolio that has played a constructive role in the establishment of a public university in Chakwal. The engineering campus of the university in Balkasar is under construction and is expected to finish by the next year,” Mr Sarfraz said.
“Campuses of the university would be spread in different areas of Chakwal including Chakwal city, Balkasar and Murid. Land is being acquired in Murid area of Chakwal for construction of several facilities. The vision for this university is to have 30,000-40,000 students and to be an exemplary university of the Rawalpindi Division,” he said, adding that there was no major public university in the division like Lahore, Multan and Faisalabad.
He said: “Many intelligent female students from different areas of Chakwal were deprived of higher education as they were not allowed to get admissions in far-off cities. Now, those students would benefit the most as they can get higher education near their homes. To further create educational facilities for female students who cannot study in co-educational institutions due to conservative backgrounds, female government colleges in Chakwal and Talagang have been affiliated with the UoC and upgraded for BS programmes.”

2022-03-23,2022-03-21,"Another body set up to curb celebratory fire, kite flying","Provincial committee had expressed concern over the menace, suggested strict police action","RAWALPINDI: In the wake of the decision of the Provincial Bird Hazard Control Committee (PBHCC), another body comprising representatives of the district administration, district police, Solid Waste Management Company and Nur Khan Air Base has been formed to effectively eliminate hazards such as celebratory firing, kite flying, pigeon homing and solid waste disposal.
In a letter to City Police Officer (CPO) Omer Saeed Malik, the provincial committee expressed its concern over the menace of celebratory firing and suggested that strict action needed to be taken by the police.
In its recent meeting, the committee discussed preventive measures related to March 23, 2022, when an increased number of aircraft will be flying from different Pakistan Air Force (PAF) bases. Safe flying operations during the fly past are of utmost importance, the members emphasised.

Provincial committee had expressed concern over the menace, suggested strict police action

It was also recommended that the authorities concerned conduct regular surveys and take swift action against all garbage dumps and place a strict ban on wasting food and other similar items, especially within 12 to 15 kilometres around airfields and airports.
Bird control is the responsibility of the airport management since bird shooters are deployed in the area, particularly near runways, and other preventative steps usually need to be taken to avoid any mishap.
“Since celebratory firing has become a real menace to the security of airspace, strict action has to be taken against it,” the committee stated, adding that a survey of marriage halls should be conducted and it should be made sure that there is no celebratory fire in the wake of important events taking place at the venue of the March 23 fly past and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) council of foreign ministers conference.
The CPO Rawalpindi was also asked to take strict action against firing in the air and to submit a report to the office of commissioner Rawalpindi on a fortnightly basis.
The Punjab government had already asked law enforcement agencies to execute Section 144 and devise a strategy to implement a policy on pigeon homing, kite flying, use of laser lights and drones near airbases and airports.
Following the increasing trend of kite flying, the PBHCC had been formed in March 2020 which had held its first meeting under the chair of the chief secretary of Punjab in Lahore.
Besides monitoring celebratory firing, the district police have been taking strict action against kite flyers and have seized a number of kites and arrested many sellers during ongoing crackdown.
When asked about the security level put in place in the city regarding defence day, the CPO said: “The security has been placed at red-alert level, though there has been no specific threat but we are not taking it lightly as doing all possible security measures, including conducting search operations, specifically in border areas.”
All the stake holders had been intimated by the committee to nominate their representatives for the other committee so that effective measures should be taken to prevent celebratory firing.

The IFFP 2022 was fundraising for charity with Voices Society, which is an organisation that worked for the benefit of differently-abled people. 
Designers, included Nina Naustdal, whose philosophy is ‘normal is boring’. All her pieces were handcrafted. Her premise was reflected in all her dresses.

They catered to the modern woman on the move, comfortable to wear yet exquisitely put together.

The PML-N Rawalpindi chapter also warned Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed that its workers would make his entry into Rawalpindi difficult.
In a meeting of party workers on Sunday, PML-N Metropolitan President and former mayor Sardar Naseem said Sheikh Rashid Ahmed was the biggest ‘lota’ (turncoat) who had ditched PML-N when Gen Pervez Musharraf came into power.

Workers asked to accord warm welcome to rally led by Maryam, Hamza

“Once the workers decide to ban your entry, you (Sheikh Rashid) will not be able to enter Lal Haveli,” Mr Naseem said.
He said his party had told workers and supporters to get ready for the power show in Islamabad on March 27 and protect the parliamentarians from PTI’s goons.
The meeting decided that women workers would provide protection to the party’s women lawmakers and youth wing to the party’s leadership on March 27.
It also asked the party’s supporters to bring at least 200 people from each union council.
All union council chairmen will lead their separate rallies and join the main rally led by Hanif Abbasi and Sardar Naseem in the city and Malik Abrar and Daniyal Chaudhry in the cantonment areas.
Talking to Dawn, Mayor Sardar Naseem said his party’s workers would welcome the rally led by Maryam Nawaz and Hamza Shehbaz and join them on their way to Islamabad.
“All party workers and supporters will go to Islamabad in the shape of rallies led by former MNA Hanif Abbasi, former MPAs Raja Hanif, Ziaullah Shah and others. Women wing, youth wing, student federation and minority and labour wings will bring their separate rallies,” Mr Naseem said.
He said the PML-N had finalised the plan to counter arrest and if the interior ministry tried to sabotage their peaceful rally, party workers from every street and area of the garrison city would foil its attempt.
“Rawalpindi is the fort of the PML-N which can be seen from the results of the local government elections in the cantonment areas from where not a single PTI member got elected,” he added.
He said in the last three years, the PTI government had done nothing for the residents of Rawalpindi and now Imran Khan had threatened to bring people to Islamabad.
“In Rawalpindi, many PTI local leaders are contacting PML-N as they want to join the party,” he claimed.

2022-03-31,2022-03-21,Over 50pc independent female candidates contesting local govt polls in KP,ISLAMABAD: The independent women contestants outnumbered the combined tally of women candidates fielded by the...,"ISLAMABAD: The independent women contestants outnumbered the combined tally of women candidates fielded by the political parties for the Neighborhood and Village Councils in the second phase of local government elections being held in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) on March 31.
Overall, the independent female candidates constitute 51pc as against 27pc and 22pc women fielded by liberal and religious parties respectively.
This was revealed by Pattan, an NGO that works for democracy, human rights and gender equality in a report released here on Sunday.
It said reserved seats remained vacant or being won without any contest, a phenomenon that had also been seen in the first phase of the polls.
According to Pattan, lack of political will appears to be mainly responsible for low rate of female participation in local elections.
The second phase of local election shows that on an average only 1.76 female candidates are in the field against one seat, while seat to candidate ratio on other categories of seats is much high. For instance, on average there are 10 candidates against one seat for chairmen/mayor category.
Pattan argues that prior conditions (female literacy rate, human development level, women’s participation in labour force and access to public life, etc.,) appear to have played a major role in determining the level of women’s participation in the election.
Because of the existing differentiation, women’s participation as candidates varies from district to district. For instance, in Lower and Upper Kohistan – extremely poor and underdeveloped districts --about 90pc women seats remained vacant. 
In Battagram, out of total 90 female seats as many as 71 or 79pc remained vacant.
In South Waziristan too, more than 68pc of female seats remained vacant, while in Abbottabad, only 32 or 15pc of the 209 seats are vacant. 
In Upper Chitral, female candidates did not leave a single seat vacant.
However, there appears significant variations across districts. 
For instance, share of religious parties is higher than liberal parties in six districts - Mansehra 16pc, North Waziristan 36pc and Kurram 36pc, and Orakzai 32%. The liberal parties have clear edge over religious parties in eight districts - Upper Chitral 33pc, Lower Dir 49pc, Malakand 44pc, Shangla 43pc, Swat 50pc and Upper Dir 57pc. 
In 11 districts the independent candidates constitute clear majority in comparison to combined strength of all parties. 
In Abbottabad 88pc, Battagram 94pc, Upper Chitral 56pc, Lower Chitral 64pc, Mansehra 84pc, North Waziristan 53pc, South Waziristan 81pc, Orakzai 56pc, and Shangla 50pc.
Analysis of the contestation data (ECP Form X List of Contesting Candidates) also reveals some interesting socio-political trends:
1) High participation of female candidates even in the conservative or traditional districts than the combined female candidates of political parties is a clear sign of emergence of new social forces that are ready to play an important role in local governance.
2) Political parties appear to be ignorant of their emergence and have little appetite to broaden and deepen democracy and to avail this opportunity.
3) Political parties seem to be more interested in top positions i.e. mayors and chairpersons than in the quota seats of the marginalised sections of the society.
4) As a large number of women seats will remain vacant even after by-election female populations of many Neighborhood and Village Councils of KPK are likely to be deprived of women representatives.
Pattan’s analysis is primarily based on the ECP’s Form X (list of contesting candidates) of 17 districts.
The Pattan in it’s recommendations said the ECP should make available data and forms of every election promptly.
It said political parties need to invest resources to set up party chapters at grassroots level and must also hold internal party election and ECP should monitor their polling processes.
It also said civil society, women groups and trade unions should plan to field candidates against quota seats.

The event —Implementation research in healthcare quality and safety — was organised by Riphah Institute of Healthcare Improvement & Safety in partnership with World Health Organisation, Imperial College London, City University London, National Institute of Health, Islamabad and Martin Dow Group.
The conference covered topics ranging from infection prevention and control, patient safety in dentistry, role of nursing, implementation of health policies and research, to leadership in healthcare, pharmacovigilance and the role of virtual reality in surgical training.
In his recorded message, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health Dr Faisal Sultan explained why it’s important to focus on patient safety. “This is a serious health issue requiring our immediate attention. Better safety measures improve patient experience, health outcomes, well-being of the healthcare team as well as reduce costs,” he said.

PM’s aide Dr Sultan says 20pc to 40pc of health spending wasted due to poor quality care

Globally, Dr Sultan pointed out, 20 per cent to 40pc of health spending went wasted due to poor quality care and 15pc of hospital costs were on account of harm caused to patients.
“These statistics remind us that patient safety is critical in healthcare. In Pakistan, we need to move towards people-centred care, while paying attention to public health needs and expectations of the community to improve patient safety.”
He appreciated efforts on part of the event organisers and said discussions on the forum would encourage stakeholders to take practical measures in this field.
AI transforming healthcare future
In a session on the future of healthcare, LNH medical director Dr Salman Faridi said artificial intelligence was transforming the future of healthcare as it provided several advantages over traditional clinical decision-making.
On medical error reduction and prevention, he said chances of errors during treatment always existed and like other professionals, doctors should also be forgiven for the error.
In his presentation, Dr Zakiuddin said there was an immediate need to introduce the concept of ‘homspital’ in society where patients were provided healthcare services at home.
“There are several factors in play leading to the emergence of a new hospital structure. These forces include changes in patient population and their needs, advances in clinical knowledge and technology, impact of digital technology, higher patient expectation, difficulties in attracting and retaining an appropriate skilled workforce, financial and funding challenges and growing requirements to measure quality.”
Sharing some data on digital medical / health applications, he said their numbers were increasing rapidly. “Currently, we have 300,000 apps on iOS and Android compared to the approximately 165,000 available in 2015.”
Dr Zakiuddin concluded his presentation by emphasising that doctors and nurses were facing burnouts and to prevent them, the phenomenon of ‘homspital’ should be introduced as soon as possible.
Sindh Health Minister Azra Fazal Pechuho, Prof Paul Barach of Wayne State University, Dr Aziz Sheikh from the University of Edinburgh and Prof Allen Meador from the University of North Carolina, were among the speakers.

Khuhro said at a press conference at Larkana Press Club on Sunday that speaker of National Assembly had acted unconstitutionally by convening session on March 25. 
The opposition had submitted requisition on March 8 after which he was to convene the session within 14 days but if voting on no-confidence motion was not carried out on the date and attempt was made to impose governor’s rule in Sindh, it would prove disastrous, he warned. 
He said the speaker could not prorogue the session without going ahead with no-trust motion the day the session was convened. By holding the session late, the prime minister had attempted to make the speaker a scapegoat, he said. 
He dismissed claims of international conspiracy behind the no-confidence move and said that parliament itself was all powerful to decide about the fate of its prime minister.
Khuhro said that certain PTI members were served with notices for merely not attending the party session and said they could not be disqualified before exercising their vote in favour of opposition’s move. 
He said the government had adopted the strategy to hold public meeting on the day of the no-trust vote to threaten their members with the presence of charged crowd before whom they would have to walk to the assembly and return. It spoke volumes that PTI was short of required numbers, he said.
About possible PPP-MQM alliance, Khuhro argued that PPP had forged alliance with the party in 1988 and 2008 as well and it made no difference if it did it again. However, PPP had reservations over MQM’s stand on integrity of Sindh and demand for new province, he said. 
Reservations over implementation on 40:60 formula in jobs and resources would be sorted out, he said and challenged ruling party to impose governor’s rule in Sindh. It was a mere ‘dream’ after the 18th Amendment, he said. 
He spoke about fissures in the PTI and claimed that currently there were four groups in the party while its allies had taken a clear stand over no-confidence motion. 
He said in a sarcastic tone it was all right when members were brought on planes in 2018 election, but the same were now being branded ‘turncoats’ and traitors’ when they were not ready to stand by Imran Khan.

Malir SSP Irfan Bahadur said that Constable Faisal alias Nadeem lived near Daud Chowrangi and when he reached home after finishing his duty his neighbour Ahmed informed him that his father, Majeed Hameed, had been threatening neighbours with a pistol and asked him to try and talk some sense into his father along with him. 
The SSP said that as soon as the policeman, who was in uniform, unlocked the door Majeed fired at him indiscriminately. He suffered six to seven bullet wounds and was rushed to a hospital in critical condition.
In the meantime, Sharafi Goth SHO Adeel Ahmed along with a police team rushed to the scene after receiving information and tried to arrest Majeed, but he also fired at them causing bullet injuries to the SHO and policeman Yasir.
According to SSP Bahadur, who also reached the scene, police made two attempts to enter the house and finally they entered and evacuated other family members from the house. During an exchange of gunfire Majeed was shot and killed, he added.
He said the deceased was a retired sepoy of the Frontier Constabulary. He was currently employed as a watchman in Defence.
The SSP said his possible criminal and mental health record was being checked. He said police were trying to ascertain whether the pistol was a licensed one or not.
He said the condition of wounded policeman Nad­e­em was critical and he was put on ventilator. The condition of the SHO and other policeman was out of danger, he added.
Dr Summaiya Syed, additional police surgeon at the Jinnah Postgraduate Med­ical Centre, said the three wounded policemen were taken to the Aga Khan University Hospital for further treatment.
She said they suffered bullet wounds in their hands and legs. She said Majeed suffered multiple bullet wounds and he was brought dead to the hospital.

2018-01-27,2022-03-21,"Depression, stress on the rise among Karachi youth, say researchers","Study conducted by NED University’s AI lab on 3,000 individuals will help treat mental issues, experts say.","KARACHI: A latest scientific study, which is part of a world-level publication, has found that levels of depression, anxiety and stress are growing mainly among the young population of Karachi.
The impact of Covid-19 pandemic has further worsened the psychological situation as in some cases the number of people suffering from such conditions has increased by 40 per cent.
The facts emerged in the data collected through a scientific research being conducted by the NED University of Engineering and Technology that had studied more than 3,000 individuals at its Neurocomputation Lab, which is one of the nine facilities set up under the National Centre of Artificial Intelligence (NCAI).
The study, experts believe, would help devise new modified strategies on diagnosis and treatment of mental health issues.
“We carried out the study on 3,000 individuals,” said Dr Muhammad Abul Hasan, associate professor at the biomedical engineering department of NED University.

Study conducted by NED University’s AI lab on 3,000 individuals will help treat mental issues

He said: “In post-Covid scenario we have found that issues of anxiety and stress have increased between 35pc to 40pc after the pandemic hit the country. This increase of percentage has been found among those who are suffering from mild and moderate psychological issues. 
“The alarming thing is that we have also recorded extreme and severe cases and in this category we have found that 28pc cases of depression have increased followed by 27pc in anxiety and 22pc in stress,” Dr Hasan said.
Despite being an engineering university, the institution was working in fields of neurosciences and neuropsychology, where the teams of researchers were exploring ‘neurological biomarkers’ of mental health, he added.
The part of the study, he said, also required that how all these biomarkers after being identified could be reversed.
Explaining neurological biomarkers, Dr Hasan, who is also the co-principal investigator at the Neuro Computation Lab, said: “Whenever we go through any psychological problem, it changes the brain patterns. There are regions in the brain. These regions have connections among them. After any psychological problem, these connections receive the impact. They may get stronger or in some cases weaker. Sometimes they disappear and sometimes new connections emerge. So basically we study these connections and analyse that they can be reversed.”
The experts believe once the research is compiled and becomes part of a global study, it would be a big achievement of Pakistani researchers, who are leading the exercise with international collaboration of the University of Glasgow, Stanford University, the Monash University Australia and the Denmark Technological University under the NCAI programme.
Vision 2025
The NCAI is the technological initiative of the federal government under its ‘Vision 2025’.
The centre is designed to become a leading hub of innovation, scientific research, knowledge transfer to the local economy, and training in the area of AI and its closely affiliated fields.
The aim of the centre is to facilitate researchers in the field of AI; help them establish and grow AI industry following international trends and seek solutions to the indigenous problems through AI.
Approved in January 2018, the NCAI is designed on a consortium model where the most leading researchers in the field of AI are identified on competitive grounds and new state-of-the-art laboratories are established under their supervision. 
As research on the mental health issues in the wake of post-pandemic scenario enters the final phase, it has raised the hopes of researchers and experts that it would go a long way both for medical science professionals and health scientists.
‘Replace traditional treatment’
“The technology has two roles when it comes to health sciences,” said Dr Saad Ahmed Qazi, dean of faculty of computer engineering at the NED University.
“One is about diagnostic, where it helps you finding timely and accurate health issues and problems. The other is about remedial action. In technology, there are several neuro-modulation techniques, which can be used for effective and durable treatment.”
He said the university’s study would help replace the traditional way of treatment in mental health and it would gradually make things easy both for the medical science professionals and people suffering from such conditions.
“In mental health issues we largely see the counselling as one of the key tools for treatment. So we can say that it [technology] gives you an opportunity to go a step forward from the conventional way of treatment and here we can capitalise on the benefits of the technology which ultimately benefits a common man,” said Dr Qazi.

The fresh determination was demonstrated in a rally in Laasi Goth, Malir on Sunday, where the participants vowed to continue their struggle for ‘Naya Pakistan’ and described the founder of their party as the only hope for a prosperous and corruption-free Pakistan. 
Leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh told the rally that PM Khan emerged as the leader of Ummah as he has raised the issue of Namoos-i-Risalat (PBUH) on all international forums and played a pivotal role in approval and passage of a historic resolution against Islamophobia in the United Nations.
He said he was the leader who had given Pakistan a sovereign and independent foreign policy by saying ‘absolutely not’ on a question of handing over air bases to a foreign power. 
The people of Sindh in a large numbers are ready to depart for the federal capital and caravans of over 1,000 vehicles are being prepared while a train is booked as well, he announced. 
“It is so unfortunate that Sindh House in Islamabad is being used for horse-trading, which creates a negative perception of Sindh across the country and caused embarrassment to the people of the province,” said Mr Sheikh. 
Protest at estranged MNA Kumar’s house 
Meanwhile, PTI workers staged a protest demonstration outside the residence of disgruntled party MNA Ramesh Kumar. 
Carrying placards and party flags, they chanted slogans and warned the MNA about public reaction against his decision to vote against PM Khan in the upcoming no-confidence resolution. 
Led by PTI MPAs Saeed Afridi, Shabbir Qureshi and Shahnawaz Jadoon, the PTI workers said they would welcome Mr Kumar back into the party folds if he reviewed his fresh decision.

Introducing Sherry as an experienced editor and politician, Bandial said she has done a great job of compiling, editing and publishing the collection of essays by 22 Pakistani women writers. 
Sherry, explaining the inspiration behind publishing the book, said the essays contextualize the place of women in the Pakistani settings, where they are struggling for space and identity. She said despite materialistic progress, women still needed to explain themselves. These explanations are about the available space and the space being sought, and about their identity. She said our societal values and family norms held back all women under the cover of narratives laced with modesty and loyalty. 
The moderator took the discussion to feminism, which challenges societal chains. 
Sherry said that to her, feminism is a way of life. “Yes, it’s a way of life, where instead of focusing on that how others think about you, feminism teaches how you think about other people.” 
She said feminism had redefined women. It gave a chance for women to be courageous and speak out on the matters that matter.  Sherry also differentiated between the first women’s activism exhibited during the Zia rule and the ongoing Aurat March. During the 80s, the women challenged state oppression, draconian laws and shrinking space for women. 
The Aurat March had no such challenges to take on. But the looming threat for Aurat March was extremists’ threats. She said Aurat March needed broader engagement to make it a march of the masses. It needs a ceaseless struggle. It needs women to explain to the detractors that ‘mera jism, meri marzi’ is about free will marriage, and about having choices regarding birth planning. She urged women, and civil society to get engaged with political parties for a broader change. 
The session, which otherwise was wonderful, faced technological constraints. 
ARE YOU ENJOYING?: Actress and short-story writer Mira Sethi’s debut story collection has only one purpose: she writes to see and to be seen. At the launch of her book, she with moderator actor Adnan Malik spoke about the characters and settings of her stories. She said the book was written in English to reach wider audiences, but the stories only represent localism.
Since she is not good at Urdu, she chose English to express herself. She had a disclaimer: English houses my intellect, but not my heart.
To keep the flavour of the characters and language original and local, she frequently uses desi words in her stories without explaining them. She said foreign publishers are always sceptical about non-western writers’ work and would ask them asked about the approach of their work. She said her fiction work only aimed at bringing out Pakistani culture to the world. Being a performing art person herself, Mira has several professional performers in her stories. She also spoke on the subjects of ongoing drama serials, saying that marriages, especially the bad marriages, were the ‘in’ things, but the trend would not produce strong women in our society.   
Mira is now celebrating the success of her debut work; she has no plan to bring out her second book right now. 
“Writing is an exhaustive work, so for now, I’m just concentrating on acting projects,” she said.

At the session moderated by senior journalist and TV anchor Mujahid Barelvi, Jan, also founder president of his Left-oriented Huqooq-i-Khalq movement, said his book opens with one of the the darkest episodes of Indian History, Jallianwala Bagh carnage occurred at Amritsar (now India) on 13th of April, 1919. On the day, British Indian army opened indiscriminate fire on peaceful protesters, killing, as per some accounts, up to 1,500 people, on the orders of Gen Dyer.  
Jan mentions that Gen Dyer ordered the massacre just to instill fear among the Indians so that they could never think of rising against the British rulers and that state was still using the tool of fear to subjugate people demanding their rights.
Sindh University Jamshoro Assistant Professor Amar Sindhu said Jan’s book presents the case of marginalised communities. She said the most damaging thing state has done is that it erased the nation’s memory of the atrocities committed against the people, including attempts to snatch their rights, and instilled fear and uncertainty in its collective consciousness.  
She regretted that the post-Zia generation was unaware of the state oppression because they just remember Musharraf regime. She said military dictator Gen Zia ruthlessly used fear as a tool to suppress dissent, and put its opponents in the torture cells in Lahore Fort. “Whenever a government of people would take charge, Lahore Fort would be converted into a ‘museum of torture’,” she added.
Peshawar-based human rights activist Shahida Shah referred to Dalton’s theory of structural violence to expound state’s employment of torture and other forms of violence to suppress people. She said for her activism was a natural option given the political and social conditions in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa where there was an atmosphere of fear and suffocation.  
To Mr Barelvi’s question that why Pakistan’s leftists could not so far make a united front to struggle for achieving their common objectives, Jan said the Left was systematically rendered disorganised because of conspiracies. He said a scattered fight was being fought by the leftists in various parts of the country, stressing the need for unity among various leftist factions. He said the situation was, however, improving as a younger generation of Punjabi leftists were supporting their comrades from other provinces like Balochistan. In this regard he mentioned support of Punjabi students of Punjab university for the Baloch students.  
Amar Sindhu was of the opinion that leftists should not have detached themselves from local and regional issues. She regretted that public domain had been left to the mullah (rigid religious people).

The Taliban came...,"People say that Pakistan created the Taliban but it’s wrong though we might take a credit for it. The Taliban came into existence through the truck mafia, said former foreign secretary Najmuddin A. Shaikh.  
“When they used to go to Kandahar, they had to pass eight to 10 checkpoints where they had to pay a fine. The truck mafia said to the seminary students and ordinary sepoys, who were not Taliban to give it a safe passage and requested them to provide it and they did that,” he said while speaking in a session, The Imperial Ghost Wars in Afghanistan on the concluding day of the Lahore Literary Festival (LLF) on Sunday. 
“Then we said, ‘the Taliban are our boys’ but the Taliban did not accept that and told that Naseerullah Babar had nothing to do with them.” 
Mr Shaikh added that Osama bin Laden went to Afghanistan in a C-31, which was only possible through the US government. “I was then the foreign secretary. I wrote to our intelligence agencies to keep a watch on him because his presence there was going to create problems for us.” 
He termed peace in Afghanistan essential for Pakistan because any disturbance there would multiply in Pakistan.  
Former ambassador to the US Maleeha Lodhi said that for Pakistan, the US was part of an external strategy to counter India’s threatening posture with Pakistan. She said the relationship has been very mercurial, problematic and turbulent and it was best when the both sides had common objectives like both sides wanted US withdrawal from Afghanistan, both sides wanted the dissemination of Al-Qaida.  
“We are in a transitional phase. It is hard to see how the new relationship is going to be redefined unless there is meaningful engagement at the senior level which I am not seeing so far. Perhaps the US has other issues now in mind vis-à-vis Ukraine.”  
Ms Lodhi said the relationship is going to be affected by three factors, the Sino-US confrontation, India factor as Pak-India relations are not normalised and the situation of Afghanistan where Pakistan wanted a greater engagement.  
Writer and journalist Zahid Hussain said US-Pakistan relations had gone through many phases in the last sixty years but a new alliance emerged after 9/11. “Before 9/11 happened, the US and Pakistan were pursuing different policies in Afghanistan but things changed after 9/11.” 
He said after the incident, Pakistan was important for the US to engage in Afghanistan as the mastermind of 9/11 was living there and Pakistan was deeply involved in Afghanistan before that.  
“There had been a lot of political statements by political leaders that ‘one call’ led to Pakistan’s alliance with the US which was completely wrong. Pakistan did not have a choice.” 
After the return of US forces from Afghanistan, the nature of relations had completely changed and they had gone back to the same situation that was before 9/11, he said. 
Zahid Hussain added that there had been a lot of talk that the US had betrayed Pakistan but one thing should be clear that nations make their relations based on their national interests.  
He said when Taliban ruled Afghanistan before 9/11, there were no Taliban fighting in Pakistan but now the TTP had emboldened, and its back in the former tribal areas of Pakistan which should be a concern for Pakistan.  
AKBAR ZAIDI: Political economist Akbar S. Zaidi talking about his book, Making of A Muslim, said many things told about Pakistan and the Muslims of 19th century were wrong. 
“I was intrigued by the idea how the idea of a Muslim is portrayed in history, social sciences by very prominent historians, including the one who was here yesterday but I can’t take the name.  
“There was a region in Hindustan where everything was written in Urdu and our historians, with some exceptions, don’t read Urdu despite writing extensive books.”  
Mr Zaidi said the crux of this book was to explore what were the Muslims talking about in the 19th century, adding that he read newspapers from that era, exploring the Khuda Bakhsh Library in Patna, Aligarh Library and British Library. 
He said contemporary historians claim that a Muslim nation came into being after 1857. “I refuse to accept it. There was nothing like it.” 
He declared there was no better word than Zillat (humiliation). “The book has many themes and there is one theme of Zillat.”  
The Urdu speaking elite realised that the condition they were in was utter Zillat.  
“People think that the sects of Islam, Deobandi, Barelvi and Ahle Hadith, had been there since centuries. In 1867, the Deoband sect started, the Barelvis came in 1895 and Ahle Hadith originated in 1870-1875. These sects are just infants compared to the 1,400 years long history of Islam.” 
Talking about his book again, Mr Zaidi said his argument was that due to the Zillat of 1857, Aligarh came into being, Sir Syed appeared, and all Muslim sects came into being. “In Aligarh of 19th century, Ghalib was not taught and you could not talk about Urdu poetry. Keats was taught. There were a Union club and English debating club,” he said.  
“Calling Sir Syed as an educationist is bullshit. Aligarh’s objective was getting jobs and not knowledge,” Mr Zaidi declared.

Mr Natiq remarked that poets have been there since the world was created, sharing that a poet can write aghazal, but everyghazalwriter can’t be a poet. He called himself a storyteller while writing poetry.
“A poet is someone who loiters aimlessly (awara gard); he talks to the trees, stars and what not. Everything in the world was created beautiful, it is us who have distorted them,” he reflected. 
The poet then talks about the use of istaara (metaphor), saying mushahida (observation) is the most important element in poetry. “Things change as we move from one location to another. So if you keep writing as you go along in life, it’ll appear fresh and attract many more readers. Poetry should make people happy; it should give them confidence about life.”
Natiq then read out some versesfrom the book under discussion.
When asked about a lot of focus on nature in his poetry, Natiq gave an example that no hotel anywhere in the world could beat lying on a charpoy under ajaamantree by a waterway with a book for company. “Nature provides a person a shadow; humans are bound for life with trees and poetry is all about love and care, which nature provides in abundance.”
The moderator asked him about his philosophy of life in terms of him having a strong voice against injustices. “If justice (adal) ends from the world, life will come to an end. The objective of poetry is to speak the truth, and if you don’t then you justify the injustice. There is no compromise on it. People make friends, but I’m known for making enemies because of opinions. History will only remember those who stand on the right side.”
Mr Natiq concluded by revealing he was working on his autobiography that will be “honest and interesting”.
Video games
Video game connoisseurs gathered to listen to art historian and ethnologist Jean-Baptiste Clais talk about his passion for the games, contemporary pop culture that he specialises in, how he put together an exhibition about video games and their connection with culture, cinema, and art.
At the start of the session, ‘Video Games as a New Domain of Creation’, moderated by digital storyteller/journalist Mariam Saeed Khan at Lahore Literary Festival, Mr Clais gave a presentation on the market shares of different video game systems, the evolution of graphics of video games and glimpses into the first video games exhibition.
Talking about the exhibition, he said since the game had to be visualised, simple colours had to be used to get public attention. “Games are inspired by the real world, includingmovies, cartoons and television, while video games also exert their influence on these media.”
When Ms Khan asked what his favourite video game was, he said there were none since as a child he wasn’t allowed to play them. “I bought a computer when I became an adult and started playing then only.”
The objective of a non-profit he volunteers for, he shared, is to maintain digital heritage, organise shows and exhibitions and display gaming machines to explain to people, especially parents, how they work.“There’s so much beauty and poetry and art out there and wonderful games.Video gaming can be shaped in so many contexts. You have to find an angle that makes it interesting. Museums are there for the community that thinks games are a part of them and their lives; they’ll cease to exist once people stop playing games.”

Addressing a dinner reception given by the Pakistan Economic Conference (PEC) in collaboration with the Faisalabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FCCI), he said the government has finally decided to devolve the Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation (PTDC) to provinces. He said all PTDC hotels, motels and other assets would be transferred to provinces under the condition that they would hand over the same to the private sector within a period of two months.
He said the government was not meant to run businesses but play the role of facilitator. He said 33 to 35 motels were lying closed for the last 10 years, as the job had been entrusted to irrelevant persons. He said the PTDC would be restructured. A national-level e-portal on tourism was ready, which would be launched by Prime Minister Imran Khan soon.
He said that a one-stop website had been developed which would have all related information about tourism sites and their managements. The government has identified the potential tourist attractions in which local and national investors could provide required facilities, he added.
He said a concept of village tourism had been introduced, which would also play a major role in promoting the country’s cultural diversity. It was a World Bank-funded project, which would attract foreign tourists to visit scenic valleys of northern areas. Similarly, a ski resort would also be developed in Chitral, which would be a unique attraction for domestic and foreign tourists, he added.
Stressing the importance of a road communication system, he said that it was very strange that a 300km stretch of Silk Road had no bathroom, which was basic and fundamental requirement of any tourist. The government is working for standardising hotels in addition to other allied services, he added.
He said qualified professionals were required to manage the hospitality industry and in this connection, schools were being established in different parts of the country.
Mr Jamil also gave a comprehensive presentation about the potential of tourism in Pakistan with steps being taken by the government to engage the private sector.
Provincial Minister for Culture and Industries Khayal Ahmad Kastro also spoke on the occasion and said that for the first time in the history of the province, the Punjab Culture Day was observed on March 14.
He said being the minister for colonies, he retrieved 200,000 acres of state land, encroached upon by land-grabbers. The value of the land was around Rs450 billion, he added.
He paid tribute to PM Khan for organising a foreign ministers’ conference of Islamic countries and said that his strategy played a pivotal role in the revival of the industrial sector in Pakistan.
Deputy Commissioner of Faisalabad Ali Shehzad also spoke on the occasion, while former president of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) Mian Mohammad Idrees and FCCI President Atif Munir Sheikh along with PEC organiser Azhar Chaudhry presented FCCI shields to Mr Jamil.
Wearing their cultural dresses, members of the business community along with their families from across the country participated in the dinner.
A traditional chador was presented to FCCI President Sheikh.

2322-03-21,2022-03-21,Literary notes: Some incorrectly attributed Urdu & Persian literary works,"THE word ‘pseudo’ means not genuine, false. And ‘epigraph’ means an inscription. Therefore, falsely...","THE word ‘pseudo’ means not genuine, false. And ‘epigraph’ means an inscription. Therefore, falsely attributed texts are sometimes referred to as ‘pseudepigraphs’ in literary criticism. 
A misattributed or ‘pseudegraphic’ text is the work whose generally known author is not the real author and it turns out to have actually been written by someone else. Incorrectly attributed literary works are not always result of literary forgeries and sometimes misattribution is unintentional, though plagiarists and cheats do involve in such malpractices. 
Richard D. Altick (1915-2008) is considered a world authority on research methodology. On misattribution he says that we have “to identify the author of anonymous or pseudonymous works (or works attributed to the wrong writer); to decide which parts of a work written by two or more authors belong to whom; and to remove from the received list of a writer’s works whatever pieces are not his, thereby purifying his canon (the roster of his authentic writings)”. 
In our literary history, we come across works that have been attributed to authors who did not pen them. Such studies are known, in Urdu, as ‘tehqeeq-i-mansoobaat’, or research on misattributions. Some of our scholars have busted many myths. Revisiting these facts would be of interest: 
General perception about Qissa Chahar Durvesh was that it was originally written in Persian by Ameer Khusrau, but Hafiz Mahmood Sherani proved that it was written in Mughal era, some 300 years later than Khusrau’s era, though various Urdu versions are based on Persian texts. 
M’eraaj-ul-Aashiqeen, a work on Sufism, was edited by Moulvi Abdul Haq and he said it was penned by Hazrat Syed Muhammad Husaini Banda Nawaz Gesu Daraaz. Dr Husaini Shahid and, later on, Dr Hafeez Qateel, proved that it was not written by Hazrat Gesu Daraaz but a shorter version of Tilavat-ul-Vujood, a work by Makhdoom Shah Husaini. 
It was commonly believed that Firdousi had composed a hajv (lampoon) to vent his resentment against Mahmood Ghaznavi, but Hafiz Mahmood Sherani proved that some of the couplets included in the so-called hajv were composed by some other poets and a few others were taken out of contest from Firdousi’s Shah nama and joined together with some fake verses. He also proved that the number of couplets in Mahmood’s hajv kept on increasing in numbers with the passage of time. 
A booklet named Risala-i-Kashf-ul-Asraar is attributed to Hazrat Ali Bin Usman Hajveri, popularly known as Data Ganj Bakhsh. Hakeem Muhammad Moosa Amritsari proved that the attribution is false, and perhaps intentional, as it is written in ‘Sabk-i-Hindi’, or Indian style of Persian, and Hazrat Data Sahib’s Kashf-ul-Mahjoob is in a prose style belonging to Samanid or Samanian era. 
Naval Kishor, the famous publisher from Lucknow, had published several editions of Divan-i-Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti Ajmeri. Hafiz Mahmood Sherani proved that no critic had mentioned Khwaja Ajmeri’s poetry until 500 years after his death and the attribution is incorrect. Sherani wrote that it might have been penned by Maulana Moinuddin Bin Sharafuddin. 
Dr Ghulam Mustafa Khan wrote that a Persian divan published by Naval Kishor (5th edition, 1883) is wrongly attributed to Hazrat Abdul Qadir Jeelani. He has cited certain evidences that prove his point of view and establish the fact that the divan is not authored by Hazrat Abdul Qadir Jeelani. 
Dr Nazeer Ahmed has written that there are some quatrains in the divan of Hafiz Sherazi that were not written by Hafiz as these quatrains are included in Nuzhat-ul-Majalis. We know that Nuzhat-ul-Majalis, an anthology of quatrains, was compiled in 13th century AD and Hafiz was born in 14th century AD. 
Mazhar-ul-A’jaaib, is attributed to Fareeduddin Attar, but Khaliq Anjum wrote that it was written by someone else and attributed to Attar with religious motives. 
Khaliq Anjum wrote that most of the books attributed to the Sufis of Chishtiya order are either fake or misattributed. 
Qazi Abdul Wadood proved that Gulistan-i-Sukhan was written by Imam Bakhsh Sebhai and its attribution to Mirza Qadir Bakhsh Sabir is incorrect. 
Some manuscripts of Mirza Sauda’s kulliyaat (collected works) have verses that were not composed by Sauda, wrote Khaliq Anjum and Rasheed Hasan Khan. Such interpolations are not uncommon in classical Urdu poetry manuscripts. 
Hafiz Mahmood Sherani wrote that Khaliq Bari was not written by Ameer Khusrau and its original author was someone else also named Khusrau. 
It is a known fact that Mirza Ghalib wrote the book Lataaif-i-Ghaibi to defend himself but put his friend Miandad Khan Sayyah’s name on its title as author. 
It is a misconception that Divan-i-Makhfi was written by Zaibunnisa Makhfi, daughter of Aurangzeb Alamgir. 
Facts about suspected or incorrect attributions presented in this piece have been collected from different sources, especially an issue of Tehqeeq, a research journal edited by Dr Najm-ul-Islam. Some are from Khaliq Anjum’s book Matni Tanqeed.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,"8,000 police officials to ensure security during cricket matches in Lahore","Australian players and officials have been given the status of state guests, according to the government directions.","LAHORE: Lahore Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Additional IG Fayyaz Ahmad Dev has said police will ensure foolproof security during the Pakistan-Australia cricket series like they have been doing in the past.
“We are ready to provide complete protection to the visiting national and international players, as well as spectators, during the series,” he said, adding the security plan was more elaborate than that of previous matches.  
Pakistan and Australia will play one test match, three one-day international matches and one T-20 match in Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium from March 21 to April 5.
According to the security plan, more than 8,000 police officials, including SPs, SDPOs, SHOs from Dolphin Squad, Police Response Unit and Elite Force, will perform security, patrolling and traffic management duties during the matches.
Australian players and officials have been given the status of state guests, according to the government directions.  
The CCPO said close circuit TV cameras around the stadium and parking areas had been made fully operational to ensure strict vigilance during the cricket series.  
He said efforts would be made to ensure that the routine activities of the people, especially of traders and businessmen, were least disturbed during the matches.  
He said ‘zero route’ would be provided to the teams to ensure their security by containing traffic only during their movement from the residential places to the stadium and vice versa.  
He said four-layer security would be ensured at the stadium and spectators would only be allowed to enter after a thorough checking process. The Covid-19 protocols would also be followed, he added.  
Dev said round-the-clock monitoring of the residential places of teams, routes, matches and movement of players had been ensured through CCTV cameras, while snipers would be deployed on the rooftops of buildings during the matches.  
He said search and sweep operations were also being conducted on a daily basis in the city, particularly around the stadium and in designated areas.  
The CCPO directed the officers concerned to coordinate with related departments, including the Punjab Safe Cities Authority, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), district administration and law enforcement agencies to successfully implement the security plan.

2022-08-27,2022-03-21,Educationists see no logic in KP govt’s decision to begin session in August,"Teachers fear wastage of time, say they had completed courses in February...","PESHAWAR: Educationists and administrative officers in the Elementary and Secondary Education Department see no logic in starting the next academic year from August, as teachers have already completed teaching their courses at the government primary and high schools by the end of February. 
The academic year in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa usually starts in April and ends in March. The school administration conducts annual home exams up to grade-8 in March and results are declared on March 31 each academic year. 
However, in the light of the federal government’s decision, the E&SE Department has decided to start the upcoming academic year from August instead of April, saying the students’ time had been wasted when schools were closed due to Covid-19 pandemic at the start of the ongoing academic year. 
“Due to delay caused by the Covid-19 situation, the academic year 2022-23 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa shall commence from August 1, 2022, and conclude on April 30, 2023, and the academic year 2023-24 shall commence from May 1, 2023,” reads a notification issued by the education department in the start of March. 

Teachers fear wastage of time, say they had completed courses in February

A principal of a government high school told Dawn that in the ongoing academic year, classes started in July which continued non-stop for nine months. However, he said that the school administration could not take examinations from the students due to ‘illogical’ decision of the government. 
A science teacher in a government school told Dawn that he had completed teaching his courses at the end of January. “I have completed courses of three subjects, including chemistry and Physics for class-10, and general science for grade-8,” he said. 
As per the school principal’s directives, he said, the teachers had now engaged their students in different activities like revision of their courses, weekly tests, etc. 
Several principals of the government schools said the E&SE Department had not communicated to the schools in writing about annual home examinations. 
However, a district education officer said that a senior officer of education department had recently verbally communicated to the district education officers to issue directives to the government schools to conduct examinations by the end of May. 
In plain areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the summer vacation usually starts in government schools in June. 
“The teachers usually send their students for summer vacation with proper homework of the subjects taught in April and May, to be revised during the vacation,” a teacher said. 
However, he said, if they started the summer vacation at the start of June in the instant case, they would not be able to give homework to the students because they would not have started their next classes and thus the students would waste three months of summer vacation. 
School Officers Association, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, president Samiullah Khalil told Dawn that the association also had reservations about the start of academic year from August as it would waste precious time of the students. 
He said that the office-bearers of the teachers association raised this issue with the recently-posted secretary education in a meeting and demanded to revisit the decision of starting the academic year from August. 
He said it was clear in the education department’s notification that the next academic year would start from August, but it had not given any direction when the ongoing academic year would be ended. 
He said the association had also demanded of the government to hold annual home examinations in April. However, he said, the association could take its own decision of holding examinations in April in the larger interest of students.

2022-03-20,2022-03-21,Pakistan signs deal to avoid $11bn penalty in Reko Diq case,PM Imran congratulates the nation on the agreement for the development of the Reko Diq mine.,"ISLAMABAD: The government on Sunday claimed to have saved the country from $11 billion penalty in Reko Diq case and reconstituted a project aimed at excavating huge gold and copper reserves from the site in Balochistan. 
The federal and Balochistan governments and two international firms — Antofagasta PLC and Barrick Gold Corporation — have reached an agreement in principle on a framework to reconstitute the Reko Diq project, and a pathway for Antofagasta to exit the project. 
Prime Minister Imran Khan witnessed the signing ceremony. Speaking on the occasion, he expressed the hope that the investment would mark the beginning of large-scale investments in Balochistan that would change the quality of life of ordinary citizens in the province. 
Later, in a series of tweets, PM Khan congratulated the nation, specially the people of Balochistan, on the agreement for development of Reko Diq mine. 
“I congratulate the nation & ppl of Balochistan on successful agreement with Barrick Gold for development of Reko Diq mine after 10 years of legal battles & negotiations. Penalty of approx [approximately] $11bn is off set, $10bn will be invested in Balochistan creating 8,000 new jobs,” the prime minister tweeted. “RD [Reko Diq] will potentially be the largest gold & copper mine in the world. It will liberate us from crippling debt & usher in a new era of development & prosperity,” he wrote. 

 





 
Meanwhile, the Balochistan cabinet in a special session approved the agreement, terming it a game changer for the province. 
Later, addressing a press conference along with Energy Minister Hammad Azhar and Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo, Minister for Finance Shaukat Tarin said that after the signing of the agreement Pakistan would not only avoid the $11bn penalty but also get an opportunity to explore the world’s largest gold and copper reserve. 
He said some $10bn would be invested under the Reko Diq project which would create 8,000 new jobs for the locals. The minister said that as per the new agreement, Barrick Gold Corporation would get 50 per cent and the Balochistan government 25pc share, while the rest 25pc would be shared among the state-owned enterprises — Oil and Gas Development Company (OGDCL), Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) and Government Holdings Pakistan (GHPL). 
Mr Tarin recalled that the federal and Balochistan governments had in 2006 signed an agreement with Canadian company Barrick Gold and Chilean firm Antofagasta to extract gold and copper from Reko Diq mine. According to the deal, 37.5pc share each was given to the two foreign companies and 25pc to the Balochistan government. 
He said that agreement was suspended in 2011 due to a dispute over the legality of its licensing process. As a result, the Interna­tional Court of Arbitration levelled $6.4bn award on the government of Pakistan while at the same time the London Court of Arbitration was also imposing another $4bn fine on Pakistan. 
He said that soon after taking over the charge, PM Khan aggressively pursued the case. As a result, an agreement was signed on Sunday under which Antofagasta decided not to participate in the reconstituted project and withdrew from its claim of $3.9bn in place of $900 million, which would be paid by the three state-owned enterprises in return for a 25pc share. 
The minister said Pakistan, particularly Balochistan, would be benefited for over 100 years from this project and the total worth is estimated to be over $100bn. 
Terming the deal a landmark achievement, Energy Minister Hammad Azhar said it was a historic day as it had not only avoided $11bn worth of penalty but also created a new opportunity for the country. He said the “landmark success” had also saved the country from blacklisted by the FATF by implementing 32 of the 35 conditions.  
Meanwhile, President of Barrick Gold Mark Bristow had a meeting with Balochistan Chief Minister Qudoos Bizenjo after the signing of the agreement.

2022-03-20,2022-03-21,Dissidents to face social boycott: PM Imran,PM blames several media houses for siding with dacoits and taking money from foreign powers to topple govt.,"MALAKAND: Prime Minister Imran Khan has claimed that he has been advised by party colleagues to bring the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf dissidents back into the party fold by offering the same bribe as proffered by the opposition, but he rejected the advice telling them that he would rather prefer to lose his government than taking the path of horse-trading.
Addressing a public meeting in the Dargai area of Malakand on Sunday, Prime Minister Khan also criticised several media houses for ‘siding with the dacoits’ and blamed them for ‘selling out to foreign powers’. 
PM Khan, in his speech, also recounted all the achievements of his government, including record tax collection, exports and remittances, during the past three and a half months.
He alleged that the dacoits were using public money to buy PTI lawmakers but told the opposition that it was going to lose “this match”. He also vowed that he would never opt for horse-trading with public money, as the opposition did. However, he promised that like a father he would forgive the disgruntled PTI lawmakers, who had been ‘deceived’ by opposition parties to vote for no-trust motion against him, if they repented and returned to the party fold. At the same time, Mr Khan warned other dissatisfied PTI leaders, “Return to the party fold or face social boycott.” He urged the turncoats to think of their children and families, saying that they would lose respect and honour in society. “People will neither trust nor respect you. Masses are aware of whatever is happening in the country. This is the age of social media where it’s difficult to hide anything from them,” he asserted, adding that Changa Manga-like politics was not possible in the digital age.

Imran blames several media houses for siding with dacoits and taking money from foreign powers to topple govt

Talking about the mainstream media, PM Khan said the media had a major role in any democracy. “It is media duty to create awareness. To stand with the good, the biggest responsibility lies with the media. It must raise voice against evil. But I have to say it that unfortunately many media houses are getting money, several of them are receiving money from abroad. 
“And I leave it to the Pakistani nation that when you see the [section of] media you will find them standing with the dacoits who are destroying democracy. 
“If any foreign power wants to topple the government, how easy it is: just buy the loyalty of 20 hypocrites and the government will fall,” the prime minister said.
PM Khan also warned the media standing with the ‘dacoits’ [opposition], they should understand “the nation is watching you.” At this moment when the nation was on the two extremes, people were also watching which section of the media was standing with the country and its people and which one was standing with the dacoits, he asserted. 
Criticising Leader of Opposition in the National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif and other opposition party leaders, Mr Kahn said people could identify the ‘three stooges’ from the opposition who had been facing corruption cases for looting the country for years. He sounded confident the opposition would badly lose the match. He told the public meeting that a decisive moment had arrived in the history of Pakistan. He alleged that the corrupt mafia was offering bribes to the ruling party lawmakers to buy their loyalties with their ill-gotten money.
The judiciary, election commission and the nation were observing the situation, Mr Khan said. 
In the UK, he said, the members of parliament never sold their loyalties because they had strong democratic values and political insight. “They can never imagine such cheap tactics in politics,” he added.
The prime minister alleged that bags filled with stacks of money were being given to his party lawmakers at Sindh House, terming the action ‘funeral of democracy’. He appealed to the nation it was “your obligation to stand up and raise your voice against such tactics on part of the opposition parties”.
‘Foreign policy to favour people’
In his speech, PM Khan also lauded India for having an ‘independent’ foreign policy that was favourable to own people. He said he never bowed down before anyone and would not let the nation bow down. He said his foreign policy would also favour the people of Pakistan.
He maintained that he had said no to the European Union envoys who sought Pakistan support against Russia in the Ukraine conflict, because they broke protocol by making the joint statement public. Pakistan would have gained nothing by complying with the EU’s request, he said, adding that Pakistan being an independent country would not become part of any bloc.
He said Pakistan could not make progress if it remained slave to the world superpowers. He said the nation would not prosper until it stood on its own feet. Only hypocrites would never stand by the people, because they ‘worship money’, he remarked.

“Indian authorities have completed all formalities for the release of the Pakistani woman. She is expected to arrive in Pakistan next week with her four-year-old daughter Sana Fatima,” PML-N Senator Irfan Siddiqui told Dawn by phone from Dubai.
Meanwhile, Suhana Biswa Patna, an Indian woman lawyer working for the release from the Bangalore prison and her repatriation to Pakistan, has thanked Senator Siddiqui for raising the issue of Ms Sumaira’s release and her repatriation to Pakistan.
“Allow me to thank you for raising the matter in the Senate. We would not have seen this day without your help,” Ms Patna, a leading Indian lawyer fighting for human rights, especially for jailed women, told Mr Siddiqui by phone.

Her husband, an Indian national, took her there without a visa via Nepal border

“Thank you sir for all your help. Both Sumaira and I are very grateful,” Ms Patna said in a message. Senator Siddiqui also appreciated Ms Patna’s efforts and thanked her.
Senator Siddiqui said that he was in touch with the Indian lawyer, Pakistan Foreign Office and Asma Jahangir Legal Aid Cell and was getting information on a daily basis.
He said that after the issuance of an NoC from the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs has also completed all formalities and it was working with Pakistani authorities to finalise arrangements for Ms Sumaira’s return to the country. It is likely that she, along with her daughter, would return home next week.
He said the state had to play an important role with regard to Ms Sumaira and her daughter, adding that after the Pakistani woman’s return to the country he would table a formal resolution in the Senate on the negligence and dereliction of duty by Pakistani officials concerned.
Ms Sumaira married an Indian national Mohammad Shihab of Palakkad, Kerala, whom she had met in Qatar.
Shihab took her to India without a visa in September 2016 via Nepal border. She was arrested in May 2017 and was subsequently sentenced to three years in prison.
Two months later, she gave birth to a baby girl. Her husband left her when she was in custody. Since her release from prison, Ms Sumaira has been living at a detention centre in Banga­lore with her daughter.
Pakistan had finally issued a citizenship certificate to Sumaira on February 17, paving the way for her return to Pakistan with her daughter.
The same day the certificate was communicated to Pakistan’s High Commission in New Delhi through the Foreign Office to instantly reach relevant authorities.
The certificate was issued after Senator Siddiqui raised the issue in the House twice in a week.

2022-03-24,2022-03-21,Trilateral talks on trans-Afghan rail project due next week,BoI chairman will interact with potential investors from many countries for B2B meetings in Tashkent.,"

STATE Minister and BoI chairman Azfar Ahsan.

 
ISLAMABAD: Senior officials of Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Afghanistan will meet in Tashkent next week for a trilateral meeting to discuss a potential railway project aimed at laying a railway track linking Termez, Mazar-i-Sharif, Kabul and Peshawar to promote trade in the region.
Minister of State and chairman of the Board of Investment (BoI) Azfar Ahsan has left Islamabad for Tashkent to participate in the trilateral meeting.
In addition to the trilateral meeting, Mr Ahsan will also participate in the Tashkent Inter­national Investment Forum which will be held from March 24 to 26.
The Uzbekistan president is taking special interest in the laying of the railway track with Pakistan via Afghanistan for its future trade and business activities. Uzbekistan, being a landlocked country, has been dependent on Iran’s trade routes for its imports and exports and the sanctions on Iran have made it difficult for Uzbekistan to continue using the same route.

BoI chairman will interact with potential investors from many countries for B2B meetings in Tashkent

The proposed railway connectivity has also been discussed at various international forums, including the Shanghai Coope­ration Organisation (SCO).
During his visit to Pakistan early this month, Uzbek Presi­dent Shavkat Mirziyoyev reaffirmed the important role of the railway project linking the three countries for the future of the region.
Pakistan and Uzbekistan have agreed to evolve a joint ‘roadmap’ which includes measures to develop a feasibility study for the project and start construction work on both sides.
The Trans-Afghan Railway project is stated to be the most economical and shortest route connecting Central Asia to Pakistan’s ports of Karachi, Gwadar and Port Qasim.
The two countries have already signed the bilateral Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA) and the enforcement of the Transit Trade Agreement. These agreements are the sign of the beginning of a new era in bilateral trade relations and will serve to increase mutual trade by utilising existing opportunities.
The Tashkent International Inves­tment Forum is being convened under the theme of “Realising New Growth Agenda” and expects to bring over 200 leaders from the government, busi­ness, civil society and academia to discuss and shape regio­nal as well as industry agendas.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,NAB names new prosecutor in Avenfield case,"Imtiaz Siddiqui is a senior lawyer based in Lahore and has vast experience in handling corporate, banking and tax-related matters.","ISLAMABAD: In less than a month after replacing the lead prosecutor, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has appointed another special prosecutor to counter the appeal filed by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Maryam Nawaz Sharif against her conviction in the Avenfield apartments reference.
The newly appointed special prosecutor, Imtiaz  Siddiqui, is a senior lawyer based in Lahore and has vast experience in  handling corporate, banking and tax-related matters.
Sources said  Advocate Siddiqui would appear before a two-member Islamabad High Court  (IHC) bench, comprising Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, on Monday (today) and would lead the prosecution.
He  has been appointed in less than a month after NAB had brought a private lawyer, Mohammad Azhar Siddique, as its lead prosecutor for Ms Sharif’s  case.
Mr Siddique had put a single appearance before the IHC bench  last month and sought a month-long adjournment to prepare arguments. The hearing was then adjourned until March 21 (today). 
He had replaced Barrister Usman Cheema, also a private lawyer who had been appointed by NAB as its special prosecutor.
Prosecutor  Cheema skipped a couple of hearings and then sought another adjournment  for being Covid-19 positive. However, after recovery he recused himself  from the case. 
Earlier in September, NAB started pursuing  the appeal vigorously and even filed an application seeking day-to-day  hearings. But the bureau started seeking frequent adjournments  after the IHC bench raised questions on the admissibility of the  evidence produced before the trial court against Ms Sharif.

Presided over by party’s President Dr Malik Baloch, the NP’s central cabinet reviewed the agreement in detail and observed that foreign control over natural resources of the people of Balochistan was not acceptable for the party.
The participants of the meeting were of the opinion that the new agreement was a fraud with the people of Balochistan in the name of development. The meeting pledged not to allow the Balochistan government to sell out natural resources of the province at throwaway prices.
“The people of Balochistan and the National Party reject the Reko Diq Copper-Cum-Gold Project agreement outright,” said a statement issued by the party after its Central Cabinet meeting late Sunday night. 
It said the Balochistan government had ratified the agreement at its meeting of the provincial cabinet in which a majority of the cabinet members were not present, which proved the dishonesty of the provincial government in approving the agreement.
Besides, it said, the federal government had also lost its mandate after the tabling of a no-confidence motion against the prime minister in the National Assembly.
It said that the terms and conditions of the Reko Diq agreement had not been mentioned and they had been kept secret and, therefore, such an accord was not acceptable to the NP and the people of Balochistan as they were not aware of the details of the agreement. The party said the agreement was also unacceptable because it had been signed at a time when the country was witnessing political turmoil.

2022-02-27,2022-03-21,Educationists see no logic in govt decision to delay next academic year,"Teachers fear wastage of time, say they had completed courses in February","PESHAWAR: Educationists and administrative officers in the Elementary and Secondary Education Department see no logic in starting the next academic year from August, as teachers have already completed teaching their courses at the government primary and high schools by the end of February. 
The academic year in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa usually starts in April and ends in March. The school administration conducts annual home exams up to grade-8 in March and results are declared on March 31 each academic year. 
However, in the light of the federal government’s decision, the E&SE Department has decided to start the upcoming academic year from August instead of April, saying the students’ time had been wasted when schools were closed due to Covid-19 pandemic at the start of the ongoing academic year. 
“Due to delay caused by the Covid-19 situation, the academic year 2022-23 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa shall commence from August 1, 2022, and conclude on April 30, 2023, and the academic year 2023-24 shall commence from May 1, 2023,” reads a notification issued by the education department in the start of March. 

Teachers fear wastage of time, say they had completed courses in February 

A principal of a government high school told Dawn that in the ongoing academic year, classes started in July which continued non-stop for nine months. However, he said that the school administration could not take examinations from the students due to ‘illogical’ decision of the government. 
A science teacher in a government school told Dawn that he had completed teaching his courses at the end of January. “I have completed courses of three subjects, including chemistry and Physics for class-10, and general science for grade-8,” he said. 
As per the school principal’s directives, he said, the teachers had now engaged their students in different activities like revision of their courses, weekly tests, etc. 
Several principals of the government schools said the E&SE Department had not communicated to the schools in writing about annual home examinations. 
However, a district education officer said that a senior officer of education department had recently verbally communicated to the district education officers to issue directives to the government schools to conduct examinations by the end of May. 
In plain areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the summer vacation usually starts in government schools in June. 
“The teachers usually send their students for summer vacation with proper homework of the subjects taught in April and May, to be revised during the vacation,” a teacher said. 
However, he said, if they started the summer vacation at the start of June in the instant case, they would not be able to give homework to the students because they would not have started their next classes and thus the students would waste three months of summer vacation. 
School Officers Association, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, president Samiullah Khalil told Dawn that the association also had reservations about the start of academic year from August as it would waste precious time of the students. 
He said that the office-bearers of the teachers association raised this issue with the recently-posted secretary education in a meeting and demanded to revisit the decision of starting the academic year from August. 
He said it was clear in the education department’s notification that the next academic year would start from August, but it had not given any direction when the ongoing academic year would be ended. 
He said the association had also demanded of the government to hold annual home examinations in April. However, he said, the association could take its own decision of holding examinations in April in the larger interest of students.

ANP provincial president Aimal Wali Khan said in a statement here on Sunday that despite repeated notices by the Election Commission of Pakistan the prime minister and his ministers were addressing public meetings to run campaign for his party candidates in the second phase of the local government elections, which was scheduled to be held on March 31. 
The ANP, he said, would not remain silent any longer on the issue and it would raise voice against the misuse of official resources. He said that spending of national wealth on the election campaign was illegal and thus his party would also move a court of law for taking action against the government. 
Aimal Wali said that the premier had lost majority in the National Assembly and he was legally bound to step down without any delay. He said that the opposition parties had taken a unified stand to oust the ‘selected’ government at the earliest. 
Referring to the PTI’s public meeting at Dargai in Malakand district, he claimed that the people belonging to Mardan, Batkhela and Swat had been provided free transport facilities, but even then they did not take interest to listen to the PM’s speech. 
The ANP provincial chief said that Imran Khan’s speech in Dargai was nothing more than a request to the deserting MPs of his party to rejoin him. He said that sooner or later the PM would step down to pave the way for fresh elections in the country.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Police raid on musical concert in Peshawar brings censure from netizens,Official says action taken after local people’s complaints to avoid clash.,"PESHAWAR: The city police violently disrupted a private concert of Peshawar’s leading singer, Karan Khan, over the weekend, triggering a storm of protest and remonstration on the social media on part of some, while others supporting the police action.
On Friday night, police raided a music party in the neighbourhood of Nazirabad that fell in the Pishtakhara police dominion, saying it took action after the locals complained that a musical concert was held on Shab-i-Barat. They said they did so in order to preempt a possible clash between the locals and the organisers of the concert held at the farmhouse of Dilshad Afridi, a local resident.
“Police took action after complaints from the local people,” said a spokesperson of Pishtakhara police. “The people had gone to ask the organisers to stop the party several time but they did not do so.”
In addition to the locals who also asked via the social media platforms for action against the party, the police also received complaints from a seminary in the neighbourhood of the house, where the concert was held.

Official says action taken after local people’s complaints to avoid clash

However, the organisers said the police broke into the party, smashing musical instruments and arresting people. They said a bag full of money was also lost in the melee that ensued in wake of the police raid.
“We had gathered on the night of March 18 to celebrate the wedding of my friend with Karan Khan performing for some 100 guests,” said Dilshad Afridi. “The police suddenly raided the venue, manhandling the guests and breaking the instruments.”
The police said none of this happened. There was no use of force but the musicians were taken carefully to the police station under custody to protect them from the angry seminary students and for fear of confrontation. Later, Karan Khan and his band of musicians were released. According to the police spokesperson, nobody approached them to register a case for losing a money bag.
The incident led to heated protests on social media, amidst objections that the police action was uncalled for, with both political and social activists weighing in with the argument.
Mohsin Dawar of the National Democratic Movement took to Twitter saying, “Strongly condemn police attack on @karankhan music show in Peshawar. Police in other provinces provide security to music and cultural events while police in Peshawar attacks such events.” Dawar demanded that immediate punitive action should be taken against those who raided the concert.
Some of the Twitterati found parallels for the police raid in the Taliban intolerance for music in Afghanistan. Others, like Aimal Wali of the Awami National Party, said the ANP would raise the issue on the assembly floor to “find out who used the police as a Taliban force”.
The SHO police said the organisers were asked to report any loss or damage to property but instead, they took to the social media to bring it a bad name.
The Pishtakhara Islahi Committee, a local social welfare organisation, lauded the police raid, saying it was taken against song and dance on Shab-i-Barat.
Meanwhile, artists, rights activists and literati also took strong exception to the alleged harassment of noted Pashto folk singer Karan Khan during the musical concert. 
They urged the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government to take notice of the incident. Khadim Hussain, provincial secretary culture of Awami National Party, told this scribe the ‘attack’ on the musical concert was unjustified and termed it a raid on Pakhtun culture. He said his party would raise voice against this incident. 
“According to my information, local police officials were involved in the incident. Karan Khan is a respectable artist and raid on his live performance, breaking of musical instruments and denigrating wedding guests were in no way permissible in a Pakhtun society. The high-ups should take notice of this incident,” Mr Hussain said. 
Social activist Shafeeq Gigyani in a statement condemned the incident and also announced a protest in front of the Peshawar Press Club on Monday (today). 
“Police officials headed by the SHO raided the musical concert, beat up the musicians, broke their musical instruments and got away with a bag full of money,” Mr Gigyani alleged. 
When contacted, Hunari Tolana Welfare Society president Rashid Khan said the artist community condemned the raid against Karan Khan and his colleagues and asked KP authorities to ensure security of artists. 
“The incident has created a sense of insecurity among the artists,” he maintained. 
Tariq Pakhtunyar, a young poet, said that artists and musicians had been under threat in KP for the last several decades and no steps had been taken to ensure their security.

Overall, the independent female candidates constitute 51pc as against 27pc and 22pc women fielded by liberal and religious parties respectively.
This was revealed by Pattan, an NGO that works for democracy, human rights and gender equality in a report released here on Sunday.
It said reserved seats remained vacant or being won without any contest, a phenomenon that had also been seen in the first phase of the polls.
According to Pattan, lack of political will appears to be mainly responsible for low rate of female participation in local elections.
The second phase of local election shows that on an average only 1.76 female candidates are in the field against one seat, while seat to candidate ratio on other categories of seats is much high. For instance, on average there are 10 candidates against one seat for chairmen/mayor category.
Pattan argues that prior conditions (female literacy rate, human development level, women’s participation in labour force and access to public life, etc.,) appear to have played a major role in determining the level of women’s participation in the election.
Because of the existing differentiation, women’s participation as candidates varies from district to district. For instance, in Lower and Upper Kohistan – extremely poor and underdeveloped districts --about 90pc women seats remained vacant. 
In Battagram, out of total 90 female seats as many as 71 or 79pc remained vacant.
In South Waziristan too, more than 68pc of female seats remained vacant, while in Abbottabad, only 32 or 15pc of the 209 seats are vacant. 
In Upper Chitral, female candidates did not leave a single seat vacant.
However, there appears significant variations across districts. 
For instance, share of religious parties is higher than liberal parties in six districts - Mansehra 16pc, North Waziristan 36pc and Kurram 36pc, and Orakzai 32%. The liberal parties have clear edge over religious parties in eight districts - Upper Chitral 33pc, Lower Dir 49pc, Malakand 44pc, Shangla 43pc, Swat 50pc and Upper Dir 57pc. 
In 11 districts the independent candidates constitute clear majority in comparison to combined strength of all parties. 
In Abbottabad 88pc, Battagram 94pc, Upper Chitral 56pc, Lower Chitral 64pc, Mansehra 84pc, North Waziristan 53pc, South Waziristan 81pc, Orakzai 56pc, and Shangla 50pc.
Analysis of the contestation data (ECP Form X List of Contesting Candidates) also reveals some interesting socio-political trends:
1) High participation of female candidates even in the conservative or traditional districts than the combined female candidates of political parties is a clear sign of emergence of new social forces that are ready to play an important role in local governance.
2) Political parties appear to be ignorant of their emergence and have little appetite to broaden and deepen democracy and to avail this opportunity.
3) Political parties seem to be more interested in top positions i.e. mayors and chairpersons than in the quota seats of the marginalised sections of the society.
4) As a large number of women seats will remain vacant even after by-election female populations of many Neighborhood and Village Councils of KPK are likely to be deprived of women representatives.
Pattan’s analysis is primarily based on the ECP’s Form X (list of contesting candidates) of 17 districts.
The Pattan in it’s recommendations said the ECP should make available data and forms of every election promptly.
It said political parties need to invest resources to set up party chapters at grassroots level and must also hold internal party election and ECP should monitor their polling processes.
It also said civil society, women groups and trade unions should plan to field candidates against quota seats.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Finding and filling health  gaps digitally,"While various startups addresses a spectrum of challenges, till the net is cast wider and deeper, health tech will not be a...","“A man was having severe heart problems in Loralai, Balochistan,” narrates Dr Sara Saeed Khurram, co-founder of Sehat Kahani. “It was during the peak of the pandemic when the country was under lockdown and access to medical advice, tricky at the best of times in remote areas of Pakistan, had become all the more challenging. But he was able to connect to a doctor through Sehat Kahani and got prescribed the required medicine that helped save his life.”
With a ratio of one doctor for every 1,200 patients, half the population of Pakistan does not have access to basic primary healthcare services. Hand-in-hand is the phenomenon of doctor bahus: women who train medically but for a myriad of reasons are unable to practice in a country that desperately needs more doctors.
Born out of Dr Khurram’s personal experience, Sehat Kahani is a health tech social enterprise that provides a solution to both problems. “I was practicing when I had to shift cities. By chance, I connected to the nurse on duty at my old desk who told me patients were still coming to the clinic but no doctor was available. I started consulting on the phone and eventually got a webcam. Over time the chance encounter evolved into Sehat Kahani,” says Dr Khurram.
Operating through a network of 37 clinics, to date Sehat Kahani has offered 850,000 consultations and employs 7,000 doctors of which 85 per cent are females.

While various startups addresses a spectrum of challenges, till the net is cast wider and deeper, health tech will not be a panacea for all healthcare problems in Pakistan

According to the global health security index 2021, Pakistan is ranked 130 out of 195. From being able to access medical advice to the purchase of genuine medicine to recognising the presence of a disease, there are challenges across the entire process. Digitisation has stepped in to address many of the gaps of which Sehat Kahani is a case in point.
“We have saved six people from committing suicide in Pakistan,” says Syed Naseh, CTO of Saaya Health, a mental health platform. Available in seven languages globally and Urdu, Punjabi, Pashto and Sindhi in Pakistan, Saaya Health has conducted over 4,000 counselling sessions and its social-emotional learning content has reached about 100,000 children.
One in four people in Pakistan suffer from mental health issues. In Karachi, where multi-generational families live in small apartments, one in three suffer from depression and anxiety. And yet, there is a taboo around mental health with those seeking it as perceived to be ‘mad’, explains COO Alizeh Valjee who has a background in psychology.
During the pandemic, relationship issues were exacerbated, increasing domestic violence. The rate of disability and dysfunction increased in those with existing mental health issues along with burnout rates. Stress related to financial insecurities, rise in unemployment and poverty, lack of access to social support and recreational outlets, inability to access the health system during the lockdown and overall anxiety due to uncertainty together made an environment highly conducive to debilitating mental health and holistic wellbeing.
But things are improving, says Mr Naseh. Mental health is becoming less of a taboo, more literature is being produced and more universities are offering psychology cases, he said while giving the example of the recently held Karachi Wellness Festival.
However, all access to healthcare becomes meaningless if the medicines bought to address the illnesses are fake. And Pakistan’s problems with counterfeit drugs is endemic, with some research statistics indicating that 40-50pc of medicine sold are fake.
“We are trying to connect the pharma companies directly to the patient to help eliminate fake medicines from the system,” says Furquan Kidwai, founder and CEO of online pharmacy Dawaai.
There are 500-plus pharmaceutical companies in the country that are manufacturing drugs distributed by 1000-plus distributors through 45,000-plus licensed pharmacies, he explains using numbers to explain how fragmented the market is. This has resulted in the creation of many layers between the pharma company and the end consumer that has allowed one of the biggest counterfeit medicine markets in the world to flourish.
Because of the cryogenic nature of the market, there are about 20,000 unique SKUs (stock-taking units) available for about 500-600 medicines — each medicine is sold under 10-15 different names. “Take Paracetamol as an example. It is sold under 30 different names — Panadol, Paramol, Parasol etc,” he says.
An average shop has say about 200 SKUs so patients have to go through the hassle of visiting multiple pharmacies to get their prescription fulfilled. The pandemic pushed Dawaai’s user adoption rate to 5x-6x, leading to a current growth rate of 9x. 
The health tech numbers are impressive. One source says there are 331 health tech startups in Pakistan, another says telehealth companies grew by 900pc during the pandemic. But this picture is skewed. While various health tech addresses a spectrum of challenges, from menstrual health to setting up appointments with doctors, the ease of access is limited to the relatively affluent that have access to the internet and a basic understanding of technology. Till the net is cast wider and deeper, health tech will not be a panacea for all healthcare problems in Pakistan.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Looking towards the small guy,"There are more than 3,000 Pakistani sellers on Alibaba.com with close to 90pc of them coming from Sialkot","

Mr Song Song, Country Manager, Ali Baba

 
For as long as one can remember, Pakistan has been stuck in a perpetual cycle of boom and busts. Ask any minister, finance bro or stock analyst masquerading as an economist the recipe to break free from this and they will tell you increasing exports is the answer. That’s also something Commerce Advisor Abdul Razak Dawood has made a key priority since the first day. 
One such measure his ministry could claim credit for was getting Pakistan placed on the Amazon’s sellers’ list, which we were told would open new avenues for exports for local entrepreneurs. How many of those businesses, mostly used to business-to-business (B2B )contracts, would actually be able to position themselves in the direct-to-consumer (D2C) segment on arguably the most competitive marketplace on the planet was a different matter altogether. 

There are more than 3,000 Pakistani sellers on Alibaba.com with close to 90pc of them coming from Sialkot

Meanwhile, a few thousand businesses from the country had focused their energies eastward towards Alibaba.com. In fact, Pakistan now ranks the highest in terms of paid sellers on the world’s largest B2B e-commerce platform’s Global Business. Since 2017-18, the number of Pakistani sellers on the platform has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent, according to a presentation the company presented to a roundtable at the Board of Investment’s recent conference. 
“There are more than 3,000 Pakistani sellers on Alibaba.com with close to 90pc of them coming from Sialkot,” says Mr Song Song, the company’s country manager for Pakistan. And now he wants to expand the platform’s reach to traders and businesses in other cities, especially the export-oriented ones like Faisalabad and Gujranwala, in addition to Karachi and Lahore. For that purpose, he and his team have been increasing their outreach efforts through awareness sessions at the various chambers of commerce and industries. 
“Apparel is the most popular category among Pakistani sellers, followed by sports goods and surgical equipment given that the majority of our users are from Sialkot,” he shares. According to the ‘Digital B2B Outlook 2022 Pakistan’ published by Alibaba at the beginning of the year, 63pc of the sellers are in the apparel category while a total of 3.2 million listings have been made from the country so far. But how much does that translate into dollar terms? “Unfortunately even we don’t know the gross merchandise value of goods sold from the country on our platform,” Mr Song Song says. 
That’s strange, isn’t it? Maybe at first. As a B2B e-commerce platform facilitating cross-border trade across hundreds of geographies, Alibaba.com is used by many buyers and sellers for discovery and information before actually negotiating the deal between themselves. “Outside China, the US and Malaysia, the transactions still take place offline so it becomes difficult for us to estimate the worth of goods sold,” the executive explains. 
The reason behind that is, of course, the complicated nature of B2B payments which is made even more complex due to the cross-border nature of transactions. “It’s not like B2C where the average order value would be a few dollars. You are talking hundreds of thousands or even a million dollars per order which the current infrastructure doesn’t allow for in Pakistan. And payments are just one component of it; there’s also fulfilment, integration with customs authorities etc. That entire ecosystem needs to be built,” Mr Song Song says.  
In that case, who else to build the ecosystem other than Alibaba.com — the most successful B2B e-commerce platform? “It requires huge amounts of investments as well as time. In China, it took us around five years to develop it,” he says. Before the company embarks on such an ambitious plan, it first wants to create a local presence and create more awareness among the sellers. 
“We are going to set up a local entity for Alibaba.com, the first such for any of the companies of the Alibaba Group [excluding Daraz and Easypaisa as they were acquisitions], and build an on-ground team in Pakistan for functions like customer service, outreach and marketing by the end of the calendar year,” Mr SongSong shares. This is along with growing their channel partners — currently numbering 10 — who currently act as the e-commerce platform’s representatives in the country and help onboard new users and provide support to the existing ones.

2021-07-27,2022-03-21,Hasty growth in housing finance,The euphoric demand for housing finance and a liberal supply of loans remains subject to ground reality checks.,"Agriculture and housing loans — along with micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) finance — are vital for boosting economic activity. And, if banks start lending more to all the three sectors at the same time, that almost guarantees accelerated GDP growth in the short-to-medium term. 
Currently, though, banks are not wholesomely engaged in such an exercise. But the government and the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) are trying to promote just that. Policies introduced for accelerating housing loans offer an added advantage to the government — they make room for politically-motivated tax amnesty in the name of the documentation of the economy. The ongoing Naya Pakistan Housing Programme (NPHP) is no exception.
Regardless of the fact that this is opening yet another avenue under this programme for the whitening of tax-evaded money, housing loans being offered under NPHP are quite promising. Already, they have reactivated the real estate and building construction sector and continue to enliven demand for outputs of dozens of allied industries and services sub-sectors. Their impact on the overall economy (rebased to 2015-16) is already being felt and is sure to become more and more pronounced with the passage of time. That is if future governments let the programme continue in its current form and spirit.

The euphoric demand for housing finance and liberal supply of loans remains subject to ground reality checks after the expiry of the tax amnesty scheme 

Within seven months of this fiscal year (ie between July 2021 and Jan 2022), banks disbursed fresh consumers loans of Rs47.6 billion for the construction of buildings. In addition to this, they also disbursed Rs11.8bn loans to their employees for the same purpose.
Thus, overall lending for construction of buildings in the first seven months of this fiscal year totalled Rs59.4bn, the latest SBP stats reveal. During the same period of the last fiscal year, total lending for housing buildings was too small — Rs7.9bn for general consumers and Rs22bn for bank employees or a total of Rs29.9bn! 
The demand for housing finance remained strong right from the beginning of this fiscal year partly because builders were using tax-evaded money for launching new housing projects following extension in the tax amnesty scheme. Partly, higher economic growth in 2021-21 compared to that of 2019-20 also motivated people to take advantage of the Naya Pakistan Housing Programme made easier this year — and apply for housing loans. 
So, the volumes of housing finance offered so far could have been larger had banks been able to process loans applications a bit more speedily. The PTI government, challenged on all fronts and struggling for its survival, is pushing banks to their limits through the central bank to accelerate the disbursement of housing loans. So, one can hope that the volumes of fresh housing loans would grow even faster in near future, more so because the “no-question asked” status of the investment coming into this sector has been extended — once again — to the end of FY22 in June.

The overall lending for construction of buildings in the first seven months of this fiscal year totalled Rs59.4bn while during the same period last fiscal year, total lending for housing buildings was Rs7.9bn for general consumers and Rs22bn for bank employees or a total of Rs29.9bn

Growth in housing finance and underlying expansion in construction activities continue to fuel growth in allied sectors as well. During July-Dec 2021, manufacturing of iron and steel grew by 18.4 per cent, whereas in the same period of 2020 this sub-sector of large-scale manufacturing had contracted by 12.1pc, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics. 
Monthly cement production which was below 3.7 million tonnes in July 2021 gradually picked up and peaked at 4.48m tonnes in October before coming down to 4.3m tonnes and 4m tonnes in November and December respectively, due to a dramatic rise in the cost of production of coal-fired cement plants after skyrocketing of coal prices in international markets — and not due to slackness in demand. 
To meet the increasing demand for housing finance, and particularly to meet the demand for low-cost housing, the SBP has now eased prudential regulations of microfinance banks. “The changes made in the prudential regulations include additional guidance on property assessment, mortgage creation and risk management,” the central bank announced on March 16. By end of 2021, total lending already made in the housing sector stood at Rs20bn — the number of beneficiaries was 75,000, an SBP press release said.
Moving forward, accelerated disbursement of housing finance through microfinance banks can be expected to boost volumes of financing and enhance the number of loan takers. But whether microfinance loans for housing can actually lead to the construction of new low-cost housing units is doubtful. These loans are likely to end up for purchasing already constructed flats and one-unit residential units or for the renovation of existing houses and apartments. 
The current euphoric demand for housing finance from commercial banks and an equally liberal supply of housing loans remain subject to ground reality checks after the expiry of the tax amnesty scheme in June. If tax amnesty for investment in the housing sector is allowed to expire on time — and not extended any further — construction of new houses and apartments may come to a halt. But that perhaps doesn’t bother the government. 
Another worrisome aspect of the housing finance euphoria is that banks are offering housing loans to their employees, particularly senior executives, a bit too liberally. The central bank needs to watch mortgage finance to bank employees closely to ward off any possible development of banks-builders nexus. Powerful builders particularly those with strong links with politicians and the establishment have successfully circumvented banking and environmental laws in the past for the construction of prized projects both in Karachi and Islamabad. Some of them still continue to do this. 
While making more housing loans, banks must also focus on ensuring their sustainability in terms of market risks and the risk of defaults.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,The challenges of the electronic warehouse receipt system,"If run professionally and efficiently, it may reduce pressure on farmers to sell their produce in panic immediately ...","The resource-constraint smallholder farmers are unattractive candidates for credit from formal financial institutions, which tend to ignore them because of their often unpredictable, fragmented and unstructured agricultural activities.
The State Bank of Pakistan, like the central banks of many other developing countries, is introducing schemes to increase access of small farmers to the formal credit channels, saving them from exploitation by informal money lenders.
The SBP, in this respect, has recently launched the electronic warehouse receipt (EWR) system for maize crop in Kasur district, almost a year after the scheme was introduced for paddy crop in Hafizabad, another central Punjab district. The EWR enables the depositor, whether a producer or dealer, of an agriculture commodity to use it as collateral for obtaining bank loans or trade in commodity markets, if and when the system is linked with the commodities exchange as well.
If run professionally and efficiently, it may also reduce pressure on farmers to sell their produce in panic immediately after harvests when prices are normally low. Thus, it may ensure a better return to farmers for their financial and physical investment and also help stabilise market prices. The system may also reduce post-harvest losses as care of the stored commodity is handed over to certified warehouses equipped with the required facilities and expertise.

If run professionally and efficiently, it may reduce pressure on farmers to sell their produce in panic immediately after harvests when prices are normally low while allowing agriculture commodities to be used as collateral for bank loans

However, the insufficient number of certified warehouses complying with preservation norms, lack of awareness among farmers and their limited business skills, and no incentives for buyers to purchase commodities from the warehouses are identified as the stumbling blocks in the expansion of the system.
Afaq Tiwana, a progressive farmer, says the EWR may be beneficial for the community only if the SBP scheme includes a blueprint for bridging the infrastructure (warehouses and logistics) gap. “There is an acute shortage of certified warehouses and reliable logistic facilities that are required to run the system satisfactorily.” He advocates for incentivising the infrastructure building by assuring business for the owners of the storage units the whole year so that they are attracted to invest more and more in the sector.
For this purpose, he argues, the government needs to get out of the business of wheat, the biggest crop of the country. The government is the major player in the wheat market but does not utilise private warehouses depriving them of around six-month business, he says. A mix of wheat, rice and maize crops, etc will ensure the warehouses do business throughout the year because of their different seasons. Mr Tiwana says for food security the government may buy grain from the warehouses if and when required through bidding.
Ibad Khan, president of Guava Growers Association, endorses the views saying by opting for the private warehousing system the government may save non-development expenditures worth billions of rupees consumed by thousands of Food Department employees in the name of salaries and perks, operating costs of their vehicles and buildings, etc “without doing any good”.
“The (provincial) government may buy four million tonnes of wheat from the certified warehouses through the Pakistan Commodities Exchange and lift the grain when needed from there. It will equal a surplus of thousands of food department employees and thus save huge funds required for the functioning of the department, as well as the hassle of checking theft of the crop from its storages by unscrupulous staff.”
Mr Khan thinks the farm produce warehousing concept may gain currency provided the farming community is given proper awareness and the purpose is well served easily by engaging the Agriculture Department’s field staff. “If a farmer learns that by spending Rs50, for instance, as storage rent, his produce will earn Rs100 then he will automatically turn towards the EWR scheme. The extension wing of the Agriculture Department is in close proximity to the rural population and may help mobilise them for it.”
An attractive package to build high-quality warehouses can find 15 to 20 investors in each village ready to build the storage if provided information/guidance about the business scope and initial technical assistance in running the facilities until these become self-sufficient, he asserts.
While the functioning of the facility will benefit the farming community in many ways, Mr Tiwana says the prevailing farm produce trade system is built to make the rich richer. “At present 70 to 80 per cent of commodities are sold at harvesting time in the country. And thus, these fetch lower rates for the farmers. Large processors and the influential (textile, feed, flour millers, etc) have huge amounts of cash at hand and make these purchases knowing that the prices will shoot up within months. Besides value-addition through their mills, they also earn a big profit through commodities trade, robbing millions of farmers of the money that actually belongs to them.”
The EWR facility will save the poor farmers from panic selling as well as stabilise prices in the open market at harvesting time because an adequate quantity of the produce would have been deposited with the warehouses, freeing the market from surplus crops. This would ensure a better return even for those farmers who will be opting to sell their produce in the spot market, he adds.
Mr Khan stresses that the warehousing concept must be linked to the Commodities Exchange for the sake of the sustainability of the system and that the Exchange should be relocated to Punjab, the largest producer of agricultural products so that those involved in active farming have easy access to it. He laments that no farmer association was engaged by the SBP or any other government entity to seek their input for the scheme.
For Amer Hayat Bhandara, a progressive grower from Pakpattan, the EWR facility seems to be working only for those farmers and final buyers who are qualified customers of commercial banks. He points out that one of the most common problems of the farmer is informal debt: farmers take loans from people in the market with personal guarantees and with a condition that the crop will be sold through them.
Will the middlemen allow the farmer to go for the EWR, he questions? Suppose if farmers want to do so, then the debt of the middleman will be repaid through EWR, but how will the inputs like seeds, fertilisers, fuel and pesticides for the next crop be acquired?

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Business leaders and sleepless nights,It’s time to lie low as there is no chance of any clarity till the no-confidence move is over.,"


 
THE critical domains of the economy and foreign affairs have taken a back seat as the political leadership has been left to scramble for continuing in power. This seems to be rather dicey in a world that is trying to deal with fragile energy markets and food security in its Covid-battered existence, and global peace in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
In addition to tales of human sufferings, the war has disturbed global commodity markets, disrupted supply chains, hiked freight charges and posed challenges to the global financial system after the West slapped harsh sanctions on Russia and excluded it from the SWIFT system of money transfers. Experts and economists have predicted slower growth and an increase in inflation worldwide.   
Instead of strategising to deal with the evolving global challenges, Islamabad appears to be too busy to care. Global experts have included Pakistan amongst the more vulnerable nations where the impact of the fallout of war is expected to be severe owing to the resource-deficient country’s dependence on oil, gas and edible imports.

It’s time to lie low as there is no chance of any clarity till the no-confidence move is over

Just as the masses are doing, businesses are also watching closely the events unfolding at a bewildering pace under the full glare of the media spotlight. With the final outcome not quite certain, the whole saga is keeping business houses unnerved.
The common man is desperately waiting for the debilitating economic stress to ease off to the extent that it possibly can, while the business class is dreading a hostile reaction of the West to the hard stance of the government towards the US and Europe. The handshake images of Prime Minister Imran Khan and President Putin in Moscow on the day Russia launched its attack on Ukraine has already placed the country in an awkward position. 
Some like to project the current situation in Pakistan as the expected manifestation of civil unrest over inflation and job losses, while others link it to be the outcome of deeper structural imbalance. And then there are those who see the struggle rooted in efforts to uphold the supremacy of civilian leadership. 
Argumentative Pakistanis can debate the politics, but they all agree that the economy and its challenges have taken a back seat for now and things will be difficult irrespective of the final outcome of the no-confidence motion in parliament.
The leading lights of business class, when approached for a comment, were evasive. Afraid to land on the wrong side of the current or the future set of rulers, they shared their disappointment with the political class privately, saying it was frustrating to watch the politicians “stoop too low whenever tested”. 
A senior business leader commented” “Prime Minister Imran Khan and his confidants are inciting violence much like Trump did in the US. How can they not understand the consequences? If politicians fail to resist the temptation to take their conflict out of parliament it can make the country drift towards anarchy. Yes, we are worried for our businesses, but we are more concerned about the safety and security of our family and the future of this country.” 
Musadaq Zulqarnain, of Interloop fame, believed that “irrespective of the outcome of the vote in parliament or the movement on the streets, the economy is not in a good shape. It will get worse because of political turbulence which will be followed by popular measures to please the masses without fundamental corrections. 
“Pakistan needs a sustained growth of 7-8 per cent for several years, powered by an increase in exports if it wants to come out of its economic troubles. The only solution is a consensus document — the Charter of Economy — which must be vigorously followed irrespective of the party in power,” he said.
Nasser Hayat Magoon, former president of the Federation of Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), said the troubles had aggravated in the last couple of years. The budget, he thought, has failed to spark much interest among the legislators. In his opinion, it is influenced by “a select group of businessmen that encircles the leadership”. 
Sources in the Ministry of Finance told Dawn that the budget exercise initiated in January has been in progress at the routine pace. 
Pulling out his wish-list, Mr Magnoon said: “The FPCCI suggested simplification of taxation, which was promised but was resisted by the tax bureaucracy. We do not expect a business-friendly budget. The timing of the budget will be contingent on how the present chaotic political situation settles.” 
He said the private sector needs to communicate with political parties and sensitise them to the variety of problems that are being faced by businesses. He warned that street agitation in the current charged environment may have serious consequences. 
Mian Anjum Nisar, another business leader, lamented the lack of clarity in politics, while Majyd Aziz was critical of mismatched priorities of successive governments. 
Regardless of the concerns voiced by the business community, everybody realises that at least in the short term, there is no chance of any clarity till the no-confidence move is over.

2022-07-27,2022-03-21,Auto parts — setting a new record for imports,New entrants are rolling out vehicles with mere 5pc locally made parts which is insufficient to reduce foreign exchange burden.,"Pakistan’s import bill for completely and semi-knocked down (CKD/SKD) kits for cars imported by local assemblers has crossed one billion dollars in just eight months of 2021-22 which is significantly higher than the record high bill of $1.12 billion for the entire of FY21.
The 8MFY22 ended with $1.102bn as compared to $557 million in the same period last fiscal. 
The low levels of localisation by Chinese and Korean investors under Auto Policy 2016-2021 for five years as well as in the new models by existing assemblers have played a key role in boosting the import bill.
As per data of the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the new and old entrants brought CKD/SKD kits worth $4.987bn from 2016-2017 to July-February 2021-2022, thus nullifying claims of achieving higher localisation.
Sources said that the new entrants have started rolling out vehicles from their assembly lines with a mere five per cent locally made parts which is insufficient to reduce the burden on the foreign exchange. 

New entrants are rolling out vehicles with mere five per cent locally made parts which is insufficient to reduce the burden on the foreign exchange rate

Assemblers are now in top gear as the eight months of FY22 ended with a whooping sales jump of 57.5pc in cars to 149,813 units. They are also excited over huge bookings in hands whose delivery time ranges between three months to 11 months. Jeeps and pickups sales have also surged by 51.5pc in 8MFY22 to 28,437 units.
Huge demand for cars has led to a massive jump in CKD/SKD imports to $1.120bn in FY21 from $478mn in FY20, up by 134pc thanks to low-interest rates and attractive auto financing by the banks till the third quarter of 2021
However, curbs on auto financing from the last quarter of 2021, persistent increase in car prices and long delays in delivery appear to have not hurt the buyers’ sentiments in the last eight months, while buyers are also satisfied over the rising resale value of the vehicles owing to months’ long delivery timings, soaring prices and on-money for vehicles for immediate delivery. 
The import bill of CKD/SKD was $660m in FY17 which later swelled to $809m in FY18 and then remained at $818mn in FY19. The fiscal year 2019-2020 was a bad year for the entire country due to the flare-up in Covid-19 from March to June followed by the government’s decision to close down the industrial units in April 2020. As a result, the FY20 import bill of CKD/SKD was just $478m.
Stakeholders had been trumpeting 70pc localisation in Suzuki Mehran which ruled the roads for over 30 years without significant model change. After the end of the iconic Mehran journey in 2018, the claim of achieving higher localisation by stakeholders has now been confined to 55-60pc in various existing Japanese models and 35-45pc in new models. 
It seems that no serious efforts have been made by the existing Japanese assemblers in the old and new models to improve the utilisation levels  of locally made parts in vehicles.
A vendor, who asked not to be named, said the import bill of CKD/SKD would remain under pressure as the new entrants, who had approved their projects under the Auto Policy 2016-2021, would enjoy a honeymoon period for the next four to five years to keep rolling out vehicles with negligible local content. Besides, new models by the existing Japanese assemblers will also take time in improving local content in the vehicles.
He said vendors had asked the government not to allow vehicles’ assembly of higher engine power under tAuto Policy 2016-2021. The new entrants, instead of introducing small cars below 800cc, shifted their focus towards the assembly of high engine power sports utility vehicles (SUV) whose numbers are growing every day.
Chief Operating Officer, Balochistan Wheel Limited (BWL), Muhammad Irfan Ghani in a letter to the CEO Engineering Development Board (EDB) said the EDB is the custodian of the auto vending industry which encourages the localisation of auto parts.
The auto sector in Pakistan is now more than 50 years old but the assemblers have not done localisation seriously, he complained.
He said the pace of localisation of auto parts is too slow due to the discouraging attitudes and lengthy procedures adopted by the assemblers which form a monopoly for their foreign principals. They protect their own interests to use their CKD parts and have made localisation very  difficult. 
Mr Ghani said the country’s precious foreign exchange is being wasted due to non-localisation while many assemblers are not taking parts from the local vendors in some of their newly launched models.
The matter came up for discussion during the first meeting of the Auto Industry Development and Export Committee (AIDEC) held on March 8, 2022, which was attended by the auto stakeholders and officials of the relevant ministries. The AIDEC meeting had decided that the EDB would schedule a joint meeting between Baluchistan Wheels and Pak Suzuki to resolve the matter.
However, AIDEC committee members reiterated that the localisation of parts and components must be pursued in letter and spirit. 
Former Chairman Pakistan Association of Parts and Accessories Manufacturers (Paapam), Abdul Rahman Aizaz attributed the rising import bill of CKD to the massive revival in sales of cars and SUVs from the depressed sales scenario of 2019-2020.
Under Auto Policy 2016-2021, most of the new entrants have focused on manufacturing SUVs, which too has resulted in the higher value of CKD imports. He said that sales volumes of new entrants and old players have shown phenomenal growth due to improving economic indicators.
Since the new entrants under Auto Policy 2016-21 can avail the concession on import of CKD for five years, localisation of parts in such vehicles, especially of SUVs, is in the catching-up phase, he added.
Mr Aizaz said that the unprecedented surge in international prices of various resins and metals, rupee devaluation against the dollar and multiple times higher freight charges have further enhanced the landed cost of almost all raw materials.

2022-02-27,2022-03-21,Surviving tough times,"Regardless of who wins and who loses the no-trust motion, the government will not find it easy to handle the economy.","The rupee hit its lowest ever of over 180 to a dollar in the interbank market on the weekend as the shares market continues to decline. 
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) appears largely satisfied with the PTI government’s explanation of the Rs346 billion relief package announced late last month in an apparent attempt to appease the inflation-stricken households. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) kept the key policy rate unchanged at 9.75 per cent but its warning that it could advance the next Monetary Policy Committee meeting to raise the interest rates if need be has pushed cut-off yields in the last public sector debt auction.
The political instability in the wake of a no-confidence motion submitted by the opposition to oust the prime minister is forcing the government to take populist measures that it might not have if it weren’t facing the existential threat from the opposition political parties that have come together to push Imran Khan out of power in spite of their deep divisions. 

Regardless of who wins and who loses the no-trust motion, the government will not find it easy to handle the economy — many hard decisions will have to be made

No one expected the Kaptaan to go away without fighting till the last ball, but the last week’s events in Islamabad have spawned fears of violence. The storming of the Parliament Lodges, where the opposition lawmakers were housed by police commandos and counter-terrorism force was followed by the attack of the PTI workers on Sindh House in Islamabad. It happened after the opposition gave media access to the place to interview dissident parliamentarians of the ruling party. 
The ruling party’s insistence to gather a million people outside the parliament in the event of the vote on the no-confidence resolution and the threats being tossed around by the ministers has forced the opposition political parties to make their own plans to counter the move. Indeed, everyone expected the prime minister to fight back — but not in this way. 
The situation is fluid and may likely continue for several weeks to come, with its impact expected to reverberate for many months. Regardless of who wins and who loses the no-trust motion, the government will not find it easy to handle the economy. Many tough decisions will have to be made. If the opposition succeeds in de-seating the prime minister, it will have its work cut out for them. 
The first job would be to approach the IMF to release the next tranche to shore up foreign exchange reserves and take the pressure off the home currency. PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has already hinted at renegotiating the deal with the multilateral lender. It is not clear if the Washington-based fund would be more kind to the new government than the Imran Khan administration. 
The second job, the businessmen interviewed by telephone over the weekend say, for whoever — the PTI or the opposition parties — is in power after the vote on the motion would be to mend Pakistan’s relationship with the West, especially the United States. “That does not necessarily mean that we have to dial down our ties with China. Going to Russia when the Kremlin had planned to attack Ukraine was a big foreign policy mistake Imran Khan made. He could have called off the tour and stayed neutral. That would not have brought upon us such pressure from the European Union and the US, with which our relations are already facing problems due to the Taleban takeover of Kabul last summer,” a textile exporter argued. 
“Improvement in our ties with Washington and European capitals is crucial not only for securing some concessions from the IMF but also to get out of the grey list of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).”
A senior executive of a chemical company was of the view that once politics cool down Islamabad will have to reconsider its policy towards India. “If you think you can improve your relationship with the West and get off the FATF’s enhanced monitoring regime without making some kind of headway with New Delhi, you are totally mistaken. I have information that our present military leadership too is in favour of resuming ties with India,” he claimed.
However, there are others who feel that the top priority has to be given to the resolution of domestic political problems. “The settlement of the outstanding issues with the IMF and the western powers is important. But more important is to tackle our domestic problems first. I cannot say if the present government will be in power after a few days or not. But in my opinion, once this crisis is over, all the parties must sit together and develop a consensus on electoral reforms so that we can have political stability. I think that the government term of five years should be curtailed to four years. We are very impatient people and a kind of fatigue starts to take over us every three to four years. If we manage to clean up our political mess, we will be able to put back the economy on the rails and end our international isolation.”

2022-03-20,2022-03-21,"IMF seeks details of petrol, power subsidy funding",Finance minister makes it clear there are no more outstanding issues as the IMF only wants to ascertain sources of funding.,"


 
ISLAMABAD: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has sought copies of financial agreements with the provincial governments and other details from the federal government to confirm the financing of discounts on electricity and petroleum products announced by Prime Minister Imran Khan, Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin disclosed at a press conference on Sunday.
The talks with the IMF were earlier scheduled to conclude on Friday last but then “they [Fund staff] wanted to see agreements with the provinces to basically reassure we are not involved in aerial firing” on financing of PM’s relief package for petroleum prices, the minister said.
Mr Tarin made it clear that there were no more outstanding issues, as they only wanted to ascertain the sources of funding to cover the cost of reduction in electricity and petroleum products. They were assured the package would be covered through provincial shares and dividends of the state-owned entities, he said. “They said show us agreements with the provinces,” he remarked.
The federal government has signed rolling memorandums of understanding with the provinces to provide cash surplus every year to show lower consolidated fiscal deficit but are sometimes remain unhonoured when provinces also go into overdrafts.
“So there is no problem. We already have agreements that we will show them” when the two sides would meet again on Monday, the minister said, adding he would hold a final policy round up with the fund mission on Tuesday. 
The two sides will then finalise the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) amicably and take it to the executive board on a convenient date.
After initial compliance with the commitments made with the IMF in December 2021 to increase petroleum levy and power tariff, PM Khan reversed the progress by announcing Rs10 per litre reduction in petroleum products bringing down levy to zero besides a cut in electricity rates by Rs5 per unit instead of a schedule of increases agreed to with the IMF to address circular debt.
Up to 700,000-tonne wheat import
Responding to a question, Mr Tarin said all the provinces were part of the minimum wheat support price at Rs2,200 per 40 kg approved by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet last week — about 13 per cent higher than Rs1,950 of last year and showed confidence to exceed procurement target that was also set at 6.9 million tonnes last week.
He said the wheat production was then estimated to be 5pc to 6pc higher and may not require imports except 500,000 to 700,000 tonnes for strategic reserves. “I would like to increase strategic reserves from 1.8 million tonnes to two million tonnes, depending on international prices,” he said, adding he would not burn foreign exchange if international wheat prices remain higher.
In response to a question about former PML-N finance minister Miftah Ismail’s statement that the country could not launch international bonds as Pakistan’s bond yields had gone high due to economic policies and fundamentals, Mr Tarin said his statement would not change ground reality. This was not Pakistan specific but with entire developing countries including Turkey, Indonesia and others, he remarked.
Mr Tarin said financing was not an issue but the interest rates being offered were higher. He said he still had $4-5bn worth of offers from banks, but “why should I take expensive loans?” Mr Miftah should also recall they had left the government with just one-month import financing that now stood at $16.6bn – against average monthly imports of about $7bn in eight months, he added.
Responding to a question whether he would continue as finance minister in the next government if asked, Mr Tarin said he was a man of principles and would at no cost do that as he was a PTI senator. “I will remain finance minister if the PTI government stays, otherwise will go home. I am not a renegade,” he said.
He expressed the hope that 5pc economic growth rate was expected despite various headwinds this year, as some sectors were also showing robust growth including large-scale manufacturing, agriculture and exports. “This shows there is thrust in the economy and momentum is returning,” he said, adding that this did not mean there were no headwinds but policy adjustments would continue to absorb them.
“The welcome news is that the LSM has grown by 8.2pc in January against same month of last year and 4.2pc against December 2021,” he said, adding the LSM growth had slowed down in August and September 2021 but the trend had reversed. “Our economic growth momentum has picked up again as all agriculture crops are growing at 6 to 12 percent, and exports and services sectors are also growing at a high pace,” the minister pointed out.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,NA speaker summons no-trust session on 25th,"Government to file reference in SC today to end politics of ""sale and purchase"".","ISLAMABAD: In an apparent move to prolong the voting on a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan, National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser on Sunday summoned the session of the lower house of parliament on March 25, violating the Constitution under which he is bound to convene a session within 14 days after the submission of a requisition. 
Meanwhile, the government also took a significant decision under which it will file a reference in the Supreme Court on Monday (today), seeking “an opinion” of the apex court on two main points — whether the disqualification of a legislator is for life time and whether the dissident MNAs of any party can cast vote on a no-confidence resolution. 
The speaker, who under the Constitution was bound to call the NA session by March 21 [within 14 days after the opposition’s requisition], gave an excuse that since the three-day conference of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) would be held in the NA hall, there was no other place in the federal capital to convene the NA session. 
This is despite the fact that the capital offers alternative locations where such an event can be held such as the spacious Jinnah Convention Centre, Prime Minister Secretariat, Pak-China Centre, two five-star hotels, etc. 

Government to file reference in SC today to end politics of ‘sale and purchase’

The opposition lashed out at the speaker for his decision to hold the NA session on March 25, saying he had violated the Constitution to prolong the voting on no-trust motion. 
Sources in the government told Dawn that the decisions to hold the NA session on March 25 and filing of the reference in the Supreme Court were taken at a meeting presided over by Prime Minister Khan at his Banigala residence on Sunday. 
Speaker Asad Qaiser issued an order saying the [opposition’s] requisition was received on March 8 for summoning the National Assembly. Whereas, on Jan 21, 2022, a motion had been adopted by the NA to allow the exclusive use of NA chamber for the 48th session of the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers scheduled for March 22, 23 or any other date. 
He said the renovation work on the NA chamber and its lobbies had commenced on the requirement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the end of February 2022, which was under taken by the Capital Development Authority. 
The speaker said that after the receipt of [the opposition’s] requisition, the NA Secretariat requested the Senate Secretariat to provide chamber of the Senate for holding the NA session, but the latter pointed out that the Senate chamber was also not available for being under renovation. 
“Thereafter, the CDA chairman and deputy commissioner, Islamabad, were also approached to arrange and provide a suitable building for holding the session of the National Assembly outside the parliament building, at Islamabad. However, they have informed in writing that no suitable place is available at present in Islamabad for holding the NA session,” Mr Qaisar added. 
“In view of the aforementioned facts and circumstances, it is evident that no suitable place would be available for holding the session of the NA till March 24. Having no adequate option available whatsoever, for holding of the NA session before March 24, therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under clause (3) of Article 54 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, read with Article 254 of the Constitution, I hereby summon the session of the National Assembly on the first available date i.e. Friday, March 25 at 11.00am at the Parliament House, Islamabad,” the order said. 
Meanwhile, Planning and Development Minister Asad Umar said in a tweet that the government would file a reference in the Supreme Court that would end the politics of “sell and purchase” and diminish the influence of “easy money” and “influence in politics”. 



 
When contacted, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said the decision to file the reference was taken by the prime minister in a meeting on Sunday. “The basic reasons of filing the reference are — to know whether the disqualification of any legislators is for lifetime and that can PTI dissidents cast vote on the no-trust motion,” he added. 
A source said the NA speaker could call the session on March 21 to meet the constitutional requirement [within 14 days after the requisition] and adjourn the session for three days for the OIC conference and it could resume on March 24. 
According to Article 63 of the Constitution, the prime minister is given three days after the tabling of a no-trust motion, for preparation. However, the government is apparently trying to linger on the voting on the motion — first by an excuse of “lack of suitable place for the session till March 25” and then filing of the reference in the Supreme Court. 
The information minister said the government was only seeking an opinion of the apex court and it could be given by the court even on the first day of filing of the reference or the court could take more time it deemed appropriate. 
Asked why the NA session was not called on March 21, he said the NA hall was not available for the session due to the OIC summit.

2022-03-20,2022-03-21,Opposition calls for Asad Qaiser’s trial under Article 6,"PTI accused of running social media campaign against army; PML-Q wants PM to take notice of ""anti-Pakistan"" drive.","ISLAMABAD / LAHORE: Opposition parties on Sunday slammed National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser for not convening the assembly session within 14 days of its requisition to take up their no-confidence resolution against Prime Minister Imran Khan, demanding that he should be tried under Article 6 of the Constitution.
The opposition parties also lashed out at the PM for, what they called, using the religion card in an effort to save his government and accused his party of launching a ‘propaganda campaign’ through its social media team against the army over its ‘neutrality’.
Speaking at a news conference, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari expressed the hope that the Supreme Court would take notice of the violation of the Constitution by the speaker, proving that there was at least one institution in the country for the protection of the Constitution, democracy and right of the vote of the parliamentarians. 
Stating that the job of the SC was to protect and implement the Constitution, the PPP chairman hoped that the court “will not facilitate this government on its unconstitutional step” and that it would make a constitutional decision, not a political one. 

PTI accused of running social media campaign against army; PML-Q wants PM to take notice of ‘anti-Pakistan’ drive

“We appreciate how the SC sent a message of standing with the law and Constitution, even on a weekend,” he said in an apparent reference to the hearing of a petition of the Supreme Court Bar Association during which the court had reprimanded the government over the attack by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) activists on Sindh House. 
He said the SC was already hearing a petition that had not been filed by them, but the bar association. However, he said the court had issued notices to the political parties as well in the case and they would present their viewpoint before it. 
“This coward captain [the PM] is running away from the vote of no confidence. He is escaping to the extent that he has made the speaker abrogate the Constitution,” the PPP chairman observed. 
Mr Bhutto-Zardari lashed out at PM Khan for using Islam for party politics and asked him not to use the slogan of Madinah state. 
“You (the PM) are the foreign-sponsored and foreign-funded agent who has been planted in our system,” he said while criticising the government’s foreign policy. He alleged that the prime minister had been given the task to damage the country’s foreign policy and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and that he had done it “beautifully”. 
He accused Mr Khan of adopting the foreign policy of India, stating that there was no difference in the foreign policies of the two countries. 
Addressing a separate news conference, PML-N’s senior vice-president Shahid Khaqan Abbasi also accused the speaker and the premier of violating the Constitution and committing treason under Article 6 which, he said, was not a joke. He said if anyone would interfere in the democratic process of no-trust move, he would commit ‘treason’. 
PML-N secretary general Ahsan Iqbal alleged that Mr Khan was using religion card to cover up his “dirty politics and incompetence”. 
Earlier, in a statement, PML-N information secretary Marriyum Aurangzeb stated if the speaker failed to convene the NA session before March 22, he would be guilty of violating the Constitution that was be punishable under Article 6. 
Campaign against institutions
During the news conference, the PPP chairman also alleged that the PM and his social media team had launched a ‘propaganda campaign’ to ‘provoke’ an institution so that it could not remain ‘neutral’. 
“When a time has come when the media is talking about a neutral environment, Imran and his social media team are trying to spread the propaganda that institutions are not neutral, be it through provocation or creating a constitutional crisis,” he said.
“It is the responsibility of all of us to demand and try for every institution to work within its domain drawn by the law and Constitution, and to criticise when this does not happen. However, it is also our responsibility to oppose the prime minister, his social media team and its members who are provoking and targeting an institution under a conspiracy,” he added.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari said the prime minister had equated the term ‘neutral’ with animals and had still not apologised to the nation over it. “Our efforts have always been for neutrality. The PM, his social media team and ministers are making desperate attempts to tarnish neutrality. We condemn this,” he said without elaborating.
The PPP chairman, who had not named the institution during his press conference, later asked the Inter-Service Public Relations and the judiciary to take notice of the propaganda campaign by the PM, his social media team and the MNAs aimed at getting “the status of neutrality” changed.
Though Mr Bhutto-Zardari did not give any reference to the army when he talked about the allegation regarding the propaganda campaign against neutrality, the PML-Q and the PML-N came out more openly when they castigated the PTI government for hitting out at army and Inter-Service Intelligence by a party’s woman MNA and an important member of the PTI’s media team. 
A video clip with the audio of PTI MNA Kanwal Shauzeb shared from a twitter space “Current political situation” went viral on social media in which she could be heard apparently talking about military establishment. “They have nothing to do with performance and neither they want to manage the country. They had never done it in the past, then why will they do it now. Actually, they wanted to hijack the system and working on an agenda of minus-Imran Khan,” she said in the clip, adding that the real issue was that the premier was not allowing those sitting in “different institutions and all kinds of institutions to continue their loot and plunder” and “that’s why they are now having panic attacks”.
Since Saturday afternoon, an unusual debate has started on Twitter with a host of people, apparently the PTI supporters, trying to make the army leadership controversial by levelling all kinds of accusations. They were found accusing the army chief of trying to undermine the government and the present system. 
In response, several people also came out in support of the armed forces, blaming the present government of maligning the armed forces and its chief.
Reacting over the clip, PML-Q MNA Chaudhry Salik Hussain tweeted: “The PTI’s social media team and a woman MNA levelled false allegations on the Pakistan Army and the ISI, which are unacceptable and unbearable.” 
Mr Hussain demanded that the PM must take notice of this “dirty anti-Pakistan campaign, otherwise, the PML-Q knew well how to deal with the anti-Pakistan elements”.



 
Also, the official spokesman for PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif, Malik Ahmad Khan, tweeted that the PTI social media team would not be allowed to defame the Pakistan Army. “The state’s existence gets threatened when a state army’s central authority is compromised,” he said. 



 
“When a state will not respect the status of the institution of army, can a state survive?” he asked in a linked tweet. “The strong army is a guarantor of strong Pakistan,” the spokesman said, adding that every Pakistani was ready to sacrifice his life for country’s solidarity and progress.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Jahangir Tareen group sees their demands being met,A senior party leader in Punjab says the PM has agreed to remove CM Buzdar but wants the dissident group to wait for a while.,"LAHORE: Members of the dissident Jahangir Tareen group in the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) appear confident they will have their way after securing guarantees that the chief minister of Punjab will be removed from office.
Sources in the group told Dawn that Prime Minister Imran Khan had all but “agreed” to accept the demands of the dissident group, but has sought more time to remove Chief Minister Usman Buzdar in order to “avert the impression of being blackmailed”.
Shaken by a no-confidence motion against the premier, the PTI government is on a mission to mend ways with party dissidents. A senior delegation of government members met the Jahangir Tareen group and asked them to explain their concerns and demands in detail.
“The Tareen group remains adamant over the removal of Usman Buzdar and explained their concerns with regards to victimisation, lukewarm response from Chief Minister Office to their problems and the bureaucracy’s attitude towards their group members,” a source in the Tareen group told Dawn.
A senior party leader in Punjab told Dawn the prime minister had agreed to remove CM Buzdar but wanted the dissident group to wait for a while, because an immediate acceptance of the demand would be exploited by the opposition as if “Imran Khan has bowed down to dissidents’ blackmail”.
The PTI government had also conveyed that the new chief minister would be from PTI parliamentarians, the senior party leader said, adding that the Tareen group assured the government team that it did not want to leave the party until it would be compelled to do so.
Problems being resolved
Meanwhile, key Tareen group member Lala Tahir Randhawa said a government team led by cabinet minister Murad Raas had called on the group and agreed to resolve problems that could be addressed through the administration.
Since the government team had been given two days to resolve the parliamentarians’ issue, Mr Randhawa said a response had started to come, as deputy commissioners, district police officers and other government officials were calling all group members to address their problems.
He said that actions taken to victimise him and provincial minister Ajmal Cheema were also being undone. “The government team will return with its problems’ resolution report and the group will meet on Wednesday to take a final decision,” he added.
Mr Randhawa asserted that the group’s main demand was “minus-Buzdar” because the incumbent chief minister had ruined the governance system in the country. “Another large group of MPAs have also contacted the Tareen group and expressed support for its demand of removing Buzdar from Punjab’s chief ministership,” Mr Randhawa revealed.
Answering a question about PTI dissident and former senior minister Abdul Aleem Khan’s conduct with the group after visiting it at Jahangir Tareen’s residence, Mr Randhawa said Aleem Khan did come and a five-member committee was constituted — including Mr Randhawa, Nauman Langrial, Abdul Hayee Dasti and Ajmal Cheema — to coordinate with Aleem Khan. However, Aleem Khan did not call the committee and he alone met Sindh Governor Imran Ismail, who visited him on the instructions of the prime minister.
Sources said the government had conveyed to the Tareen group that CM Buzdar would be replaced by another senior leader within the party and four names have started doing the rounds in the PTI parliamentarians’ circle, including those of provincial minister Raja Yasir Humayun, Murad Raas, Mian Aslam Iqbal and Asif Nakai.
Tareen group members told Dawn that 13 of their 17 MPAs were elected as independents and later joined the party. “Even if the Tareen group decided to vote against PM Imran Khan in the centre and CM Buzdar in Punjab, the government would not be able to de-seat them because they were not elected on PTI tickets,” Mr Randhawa told Dawn.
Tareen ‘held party together’
Meanwhile, Jahangir Tareen’s spokesman Awn Chaudhry said some eight MNAs were standing with the group and take a decision about supporting or not supporting the government in the opposition’s no-confidence motion.
“I was personally disturbed when I saw that several MNAs stood against the party,” he said and added that it all happened because PM Khan pushed away Jahangir Tareen, who was actually keeping all MNAs intact with the party.
“Mr Tareen used to help the prime minister in difficult times and resolve party parliamentarians’ problems,” he said and asked whether the PTI should not hold the premier’s political aides accountable for all this mess.
Answering a question whether Jahangir Tareen could enter into any deal with the PML-N, he said he could not comment on his leader’s behalf. “Whatever Jahangir Tareen will decide, his whole group will go along his decision,” he asserted.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,RED ZONE FILES: All set for a collision course,Some govt officials have started to acknowledge in private that prospects of surviving this challenge from opposition are slim.,"Political entanglements may once again be headed to the courts. 
Speaker Asad Qaiser has summoned the crucial session of the National Assembly on Friday, March 25, which is three days longer than the Constitution has stipulated once the required number of parliamentarians have requisitioned a session. This order further complicates a situation that is fraught with danger and uncertainty. Here’s where things stand today and what they could portend in the coming days:

The PTI government is doing legal gymnastics with constitutional procedures, but there is no way around the vote of no-confidence against Prime Minister Imran Khan. The only way that the PM can retain his job is if the opposition fails to muster a strength of 172 in the lower house during the vote. Or if for some reason, the opposition withdraws the motion. There is no other way out for the PM and his cabinet. Legal experts say the speaker may attempt to delay the process and push the vote forward, and this may ultimately end up in courts, but the vote will need to take place one way or another. What matters is the numbers game. Everything else is a side show.
The courts may in fact become the battleground before the real battle on the floor of the National Assembly. If both the government and the opposition head to the Supreme Court with their petitions, the court may need to pronounce on the following: (i) if Article 63 of the constitution allows the party head to stop errant members of his party from voting on the confidence motion (ii) if the disqualification under Article 3 for members indulging in floor crossing can be a lifetime ban (iii) if the speaker can delay summoning of the National Assembly for more than the two-week limit spelt out in the Constitution and whether he can somehow delay the moving of the motion for the vote of no confidence. 
These issues will be addressed by the Supreme Court this week and a lot will depend on how long the SC takes to pronounce a decision. According to legal experts, if the SC reaffirms the obvious interpretation of the constitutional procedure for the vote of no-confidence, then the government will have no other option but to fight the numbers game, which it appears to be losing at this stage.
The planned rallies by the government and the opposition on Sunday, March 27, have added an explosive element to the volatile situation. Inside the Red Zone, there is a genuine fear that if these rallies are allowed to take place as scheduled, then there is a danger of violence breaking out. Now, imagine the real danger: when such violence ensues between a sitting government and its opponents, what does the police do? And if the police cannot handle such a scenario, the only option is what Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid has been referring to in his speeches: handing over security responsibility to the armed forces.
There is no need for the situation to deteriorate to such a level. But it is being dragged towards such an outcome by the government itself. What is otherwise a straightforward constitutional procedure is being weaponised by the use of mobs and threats. These in turn are being used to fuel a new narrative that focuses on accusations of horse-trading as a means to undermine a democratic process. What is being deliberately ignored is that such allegations need to be proved in a court of law for any action to be taken. They are handy for political sloganeering but cannot be used to counter what is purely a constitutional and legal process.
The government allies have stitched up their agreements with the opposition but according to Red Zone insiders, they will hold back formal announcements till after the OIC foreign ministers’ meeting. Despite the ups and downs of this week and the increase in political temperatures, the PML-Q, MQM and BAP are still locked into an understanding whose final details are being stitched up. One parliamentarian from the allied parties said their decision was intact as per the understanding reached.
One key challenge for the opposition is to keep its members safe, secure and available in Islamabad. This has led to daily congregations for dinners where the leaders keep an eye on their flock while also ensuring that none are under any pressure or facing threats. Opposition insiders say this is harder than it sounds as these elected members have a strong gravitational pull from their constituencies and yet cannot be allowed to disperse from Islamabad at a crucial time when every single vote counts.
While it is clear that the vote of no confidence will take place in a matter of days, there remain some uncertainties that are becoming a source of concern: (i) if PM Khan is on a collision course – as is evident from his speeches, including the one on Sunday – is there a way the system can be saved from instability without the opposition ceding space to him? (ii) Will the establishment be forced to intervene if matters start to spin out of control (iii) what will happen if the PM decides to use the ‘nuclear option’ of firing a senior official and appointing a new one in his place?
Some senior government officials have started to acknowledge in private that their prospects of surviving this challenge from the opposition are slim. They are now also admitting that the root cause of the dire situation they find themselves in today is the unnecessary and avoidable confrontation with the establishment. 
Yet they are now locked into a predicament that can only reinforce itself if the PTI government falls. The narrative being stitched together by the party leadership will likely further accentuate the source of the conflict and could trigger greater political instability.

The Red Zone is under stress. The coming ten days will determine if it can sustain it.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Cases of femicide rising sharply in Iraqi Kurdistan,11 women were killed in the first two months of this year...,"SULAIMANIYAH: A woman burned alive by her husband, others shot dead by a father or a teenage brother — bloody violence against women has spiked in northern Iraq’s Kurdish region.
The autonomous area, keen on projecting an image of a relative haven of stability and tolerance in war-battered Iraq, has seen a sharp rise in femicide, killings motivated by gender.
“In the past two months, there has been an increase in femicide compared to the previous year,” said Hiwa Karim Jwamir of the Kurdish General Directorate for Combating Violence Against Women.
In the first two months of 2022, 11 women were killed in autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan, most of them shot, said the official based in Sulaimaniyah.
Forty-five women were killed in 2021, up from 25 the previous year, said Jwamir.

11 women were killed in the first two months of this year

On a Friday before dawn, a 15-year-old teenager was fatally wounded by six bullets fired by her father in the village of Soran. The man told police his daughter “went out with two boys late at night”, according to a domestic violence unit which also records so-called “honour killings”.
Across Iraq, gender-based violence rose 125 per cent to over 22,000 cases between 2020 and 2021, says the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund, which has also pointed to “a worrisome increase in depression and suicide among women and girls”. Last December, a 16-year-old girl was disfigured with acid in Baghdad by an adult who wanted to marry her but had been rejected.
For years, activists have denounced violence against women and forced marriages in Iraq, which remains a conservative and patriarchal society.
“Cases of violence against women are on the rise,” said long-time Kurdistan activist Bahar Munzir, director of local group the People’s Development Organisation.
“Most of the women who are killed are victims of a family member.”
A few days before International Women’s Day on March 8, the body of a 20-year-old woman was found on the side of the road in Arbil, the capital of Kurdistan.
Maria Sami, the victim, was known on social networks for her feminist speeches.
The following day, on March 9, Kirkuk police announced the arrest of the killer, her 18-year-old brother.
While he was still on the run, he spoke by phone to a Kurdish television channel and tried to justify the killing by charging his sister had failed to obey the family. In February, mother-of-two Shinyar Huner Rafiq died in hospital, five days after being admitted with serious burns.
“Her husband had come home one evening in a state of intoxication,” Shinyar’s father, Huner Rafiq, told AFP.
“He doused her body in gasoline and set it on fire.” After the father reported the killing, police arrested the husband. “Before dying, Shinyar told us the facts,” said the bereaved father. “We recorded it, and we submitted the video to the investigators.”
Kurdistan’s prime minister Masrour Barzani denounced the “horrific case”, saying he was “deeply troubled” by the spate of violent attacks against women.
The government must impose “the heaviest possible penalty on perpetrators”, he said in a statement.
“There is no honour in honour killings. I’m determined to protect every woman, girl and child from abuse ... This scourge must end.”
In early February, Dohuk police said they had found the corpse of Doski Azad, a 23-year-old transgender woman who had been ostracised by family members.
An arrest warrant was issued to find the suspected murderer: the victim’s brother, who had in recent years been living in Europe.
He had called his family to inform them of his crime and of where the body was, according to police.
The murder was condemned by the UN mission in Iraq, and the consulates of Western countries in Arbil.
The news provoked a torrent of hatred online — against the victim, even though some voices defended minorities’ rights.
In June 2011, Kurdistan passed a law criminalising domestic violence and female genital mutilation.
The law, which threatens life in prison for “honour” crimes, was hailed by non-governmental groups as a major step forward. But the law’s enforcement is hampered by a climate of impunity and a common fear of speaking out.
“When a woman is killed, the procedures of the security services are not the same as when it’s a man, the trial is not the same,” said Munzir, the activist.
“Some cases don’t even make it to court. They are subject to tribal resolution between the man’s family and that of his wife, the victim.“

2022-01-12,2022-03-21,Committee set up to identify officers involved in leasing out Monal Restaurant,"Body asked to assess the transparency of bidding process, comparison of rent rates offered by the lease.","ISLAMABAD: A four-member committee has been formed by the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to identify officers who were involved in processing and leasing out Monal Restaurant and other buildings in the protected area of Margalla Hills National Park (MHNP). 
This has been done in compliance with the orders of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Jan 12, 2022. According to a notification issued by the CDA’s Confidential Wing, the committee is supposed to complete its task within 15 days “so that disciplinary proceedings could be initiated against the delinquent officers/officials”.
Sources in the wing said Deputy Director General Land and Estate Afnan Alam would head the committee while Deputy Financial Adviser Khawaja Aizad Hussain, Director Laboratory Khalid Nawaz and Director Regional Planning Fraz Malik will be its members.

Body asked to assess transparency of bidding process, comparison of rent rates offered by the lease and accepted by the then CDA administration

The notification of the committee, which was issued on March 10, and is available with Dawn, tasked the committee to “identify officer involved in processing/leasing of land/structure of Monal Restaurant in the protected area of National Park in violation of the Act of 1997, Ordinance of 1960, Ordinance of 1966, Ordinance of 1979 and the regulations made under the respective statutes”.
According to the terms of reference (TORs), the committee has been given the task to identify factors behind construction of Monal Restaurant and other buildings in the protected area as it was in violation of various acts and ordinances.
The committee has been directed to “assess the transparency of bidding process for leasing of Monal to a private entity and comparison of rent rates offered by the lease and accepted by the then CDA administration with the then market prices for facilities of similar size and nature, identify/mention relevant provision of laws and regulations, infringed while allowing construction/lease of the Monal Resturant and to ascertain the loss/ damages to wildlife, flora and fauna and environmental changes in National Park due to said construction of the restaurant”.
While hearing a petition related to Monal Restaurant, the IHC in January this year had ordered the CDA and Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) to seal the building and start proceedings against other buildings that were operating in the national park in violation of rules.
Following the said orders, the CDA and ICT administration sealed the restaurant.
However, the Supreme Court on March 9, suspended the Jan 11 IHC judgement of sealing and taking over possession of the restaurant.
“The unsigned order of the IHC will remain suspended,” ordered a three-judge Supreme Court bench headed by Justice Ijazul Ahsan. Consequently, Monal Restaurant was de-sealed.
The court, which had taken up the appeal of Monal Group of Companies, pointed out why no action was taken against the other 13 restaurants situated in close proximity of Monal and why Monal was discriminated against only and on what basis, its possession was taken over without the certified copy of the high court.
The IHC had ordered the CDA and IWMB to take over forthwith the possession of the restaurant and seal its premises, subject to allowing its owner/management to take out their property. 
The CDA, after construction of the restaurant, had leased it out to a private firm for 15 years and the lease agreement expired last year. 
However, a few years before the expiry of agreement, the lessee started paying rent to the military, which stated that the land where Monal was constructed belonged to them in accordance with a notification issued in 1912.
IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah rejected the military ownership’s claim over the land and ordered recovery of all the rent paid by the Monal Restaurant management. 
The court had also asked the defence ministry to ensure that the amount received as rent was deposited in the exchequer.
“The claim of Remount, Veterinary and Farms Directorate of Pakistan Army, regarding 8,068 acres of land in the notified national park area is in 
violation of the Ordinance of 1979, read with the Ordinance of 1960, and the [Islamabad] Master Plan,” the IHC had declared.
The IHC chief justice had also directed civic agencies to seal the sprawling naval golf course located in the national park area and unless an environmentally-friendly use can be found for it, ordered its demolition within four weeks.
A senior CDA officer confirmed that the inquiry committee had been formed and added that the committee was yet to hold its first meeting.

The statement of traffic police stated that SSP Rai Mazhar proposed to the Capital Development Authority to make the highway signal free.
The project has saved Rs7.5 billion as instead of constructing overhead bridges, the corridor was made signal free by constructing protected U-turns. 
The data of the police showed that over 115,000 vehicles enter and leave from Islamabad Chowk to Zero Point. As they will travel on the signal-free corridor, it will save around 100,000 man hours of people.
On an average four people travel in a vehicle so if each vehicle saves 15 minutes the entire saving of time of four persons will be one hour, the statement said.
Chief Commissioner Islamabad Amer Ali Ahmed had appreciated the proposal of SSP traffic and directed immediate implementation of the proposal. 
Now the Srinagar Highway has been made signal free by constructing three protective U-turns that connected Islamabad and Rawalpindi with the new airport.
All foreign guests and dignitaries use this road while travelling to and from the airport.
The duration of the travel to Islamabad airport would reduce to half.
This will help solve traffic jam by 60 to 70pc while travelling time to Islamabad airport will also reduce considerably, the SSP (Traffic) said.

2022-03-20,2022-03-21,Islamabad sees decline in Covid-19 mortality rate,Fafen’s findings stress the need for continued vigilance,"ISLAMABAD: As vaccination against Covid-19 has surpassed the figure of 90pc in the federal capital, the city has seen a reduction in mortality rate.
According to data, only 133 cases were reported in the city during the last one week, with the positivity ratio remaining at 1pc. 
On the other hand, Rawalpindi reported five positive cases on Sunday.
In another development, the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) launched a report on Sunday that covered Pakistan’s Covid-19 response during January-February 2022.

Fafen’s findings stress the need for continued vigilance

During the last few weeks, the fifth wave of the pandemic has been losing severity in the country, which can be gauged from the fact that the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) has decided to lift all restrictions for fully-vaccinated people.
Talking to Dawn, District Health Officer Islamabad Dr Zaeem Zia said though the city had surpassed the figure of 90pc, in terms of complete vaccination, it should be considered around 95pc as a number of residents of the city were outside the country.
“The reduced mortality rate shows credibility of vaccination in the city. Despite the fact that Islamabad has a large number of medical tourism, the mortality rate is almost zero,” he added.
While sharing the weekly data, Dr Zia said in the last week of January, the city observed the highest positivity rate of 16.45pc which then gradually started to decline, reaching 1pc during the last week.
The data showed that on Sunday, the capital reported 21 Covid-19 patients and the infection rate of 1.32pc.
Meanwhile,five people tested positive in Rawalpindi district and four recovered during the last 24 hours.
According to the health authority’s data, the positivity ratio in the district was 0.56pc. A total of 892 samples were collected out of which results of 887 people came back negative.
There are 76 active patients in Rawalpindi district as of March 20, with three patients admitted to hospitals and 73 home isolated.
Two patients surfaced from the cantonment areas and one patient each from Kallar Syedan, Taxila and Islamabad. There is no patient on ventilator, however one is on oxygen and the other two are stable.
On the other hand, a report of the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) has observed varying healthcare capacities across regions and districts during the fifth wave of Covid-19 that remained a major challenge and key concern.
With the onset of Omicron variant in December last year, confirmed cases jumped to 133,839 in January – the highest since the start of the pandemic – while the number of recoveries was recorded at 38,366.
Compared to January, cases started to decline in February. The health authorities recorded 79,855 confirmed cases and 147,548 recoveries in the month.
Fafen’s findings of the third pandemic governance monitoring report, released on Sunday, reinforced the need for consistent and continued vigilance and the necessity of both medium and long-term structural and policy changes built on the lessons learnt.
Compared to the earlier waves, the report highlighted a broad two-pronged pandemic response to the fifth surge of Covid-19 that helped Pakistan withstand and manage the challenges relatively well.
The first aspect of the response comprised varying levels of restrictions and targeted measures in areas with high positivity ratio.
The second wave comprised a parallel push for increased vaccination and broadening the eligible population section to include the 12-16 age group. A remarkable increase of 30 million to the fully vaccinated column during the first two months of the ongoing year is a testament to the seriousness accorded to the effort, the report said. 
Despite a slow start, Pakistan’s vaccination drive gained significant momentum, reaching an average of one million doses per day by the end of last year.
Pakistan had administered 216.9 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine by the first week of March 2022. Approximately 100 million people were fully vaccinated (65pc of the vaccine eligible population and 44pc of the total estimated population), whereas around 127.5 million are ‘partially vaccinated’ as per the information provided by the NCOC website and their official twitter account.
As assessed in the report, had the Omicron variant been as severe as the earlier variants, it would have seriously tested the healthcare system — a factor that shall not be lost on policymakers responsible for responding to any new variant of Covid-19 or a completely new pandemic.
For instance, the availability of beds, ventilators and doctors within the observed districts showed that the healthcare system in Pakistan was still under-equipped — more so in some areas than others.
If the situation had necessitated the hospitalisation of those infected, the number of patients per ventilator and patients per bed would have resulted in severe consequences for some of the districts.
For instance, Karak district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa would have 21,132 and 1,023 patients per ventilator and bed respectively, followed by Mardan with 669 patients per ventilator and 324 patients per bed, and Rawalpindi with 204 patients per ventilator and four patients per bed.
The private sector has played a significant role in providing services and facilities that have contributed to the overall pandemic governance and response. However, there remains the need for more effective regulation, especially regarding the pricing of critical services.
However, what remains a key concern for the government is the issue of price regulation.
Attendants of patients interviewed at various health facilities highlighted the significant variance in test pricing. The respondents claimed to have paid prices ranging between Rs1,000 and Rs15,000 or more.

Talking to Dawn, the minister said a fully funded Annual Development Programme (ADP) of Rs1.4 billion was approved for the construction of the university campus. He said the project was the joint ownership of the city as locals contributed funds towards raising different buildings.
The foundation of UoC was laid by Prime Minister Imran Khan near Balkasar area two years ago, which is nearing completion, Mr Sarfraz said.
The request for establishment of the city campus was also submitted to the Punjab government so that students of Chakwal city did not travel 16km to Balkasar daily, he said.
The PC-I for the city campus has been approved and Rs1.4 billion allocated for the construction of the campus, the minister said.
“Two academic blocks, an admin block and male and female hostels would be built and renovation carried out with the fund,” the provincial minister said, adding that construction of the city campus would be completed by 2024.
“The Ministry of Higher Education was my favourite portfolio that has played a constructive role in the establishment of a public university in Chakwal. The engineering campus of the university in Balkasar is under construction and is expected to finish by the next year,” Mr Sarfraz said.
“Campuses of the university would be spread in different areas of Chakwal including Chakwal city, Balkasar and Murid. Land is being acquired in Murid area of Chakwal for construction of several facilities. The vision for this university is to have 30,000-40,000 students and to be an exemplary university of the Rawalpindi Division,” he said, adding that there was no major public university in the division like Lahore, Multan and Faisalabad.
He said: “Many intelligent female students from different areas of Chakwal were deprived of higher education as they were not allowed to get admissions in far-off cities. Now, those students would benefit the most as they can get higher education near their homes. To further create educational facilities for female students who cannot study in co-educational institutions due to conservative backgrounds, female government colleges in Chakwal and Talagang have been affiliated with the UoC and upgraded for BS programmes.”

In a letter to City Police Officer (CPO) Omer Saeed Malik, the provincial committee expressed its concern over the menace of celebratory firing and suggested that strict action needed to be taken by the police.
In its recent meeting, the committee discussed preventive measures related to March 23, 2022, when an increased number of aircraft will be flying from different Pakistan Air Force (PAF) bases. Safe flying operations during the fly past are of utmost importance, the members emphasised.

Provincial committee had expressed concern over the menace, suggested strict police action

It was also recommended that the authorities concerned conduct regular surveys and take swift action against all garbage dumps and place a strict ban on wasting food and other similar items, especially within 12 to 15 kilometres around airfields and airports.
Bird control is the responsibility of the airport management since bird shooters are deployed in the area, particularly near runways, and other preventative steps usually need to be taken to avoid any mishap.
“Since celebratory firing has become a real menace to the security of airspace, strict action has to be taken against it,” the committee stated, adding that a survey of marriage halls should be conducted and it should be made sure that there is no celebratory fire in the wake of important events taking place at the venue of the March 23 fly past and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) council of foreign ministers conference.
The CPO Rawalpindi was also asked to take strict action against firing in the air and to submit a report to the office of commissioner Rawalpindi on a fortnightly basis.
The Punjab government had already asked law enforcement agencies to execute Section 144 and devise a strategy to implement a policy on pigeon homing, kite flying, use of laser lights and drones near airbases and airports.
Following the increasing trend of kite flying, the PBHCC had been formed in March 2020 which had held its first meeting under the chair of the chief secretary of Punjab in Lahore.
Besides monitoring celebratory firing, the district police have been taking strict action against kite flyers and have seized a number of kites and arrested many sellers during ongoing crackdown.
When asked about the security level put in place in the city regarding defence day, the CPO said: “The security has been placed at red-alert level, though there has been no specific threat but we are not taking it lightly as doing all possible security measures, including conducting search operations, specifically in border areas.”
All the stake holders had been intimated by the committee to nominate their representatives for the other committee so that effective measures should be taken to prevent celebratory firing.

“Once the workers decide to ban your entry, you (Sheikh Rashid) will not be able to enter Lal Haveli,” Mr Naseem said.
He said his party had told workers and supporters to get ready for the power show in Islamabad on March 27 and protect the parliamentarians from PTI’s goons.
The meeting decided that women workers would provide protection to the party’s women lawmakers and youth wing to the party’s leadership on March 27.
It also asked the party’s supporters to bring at least 200 people from each union council.
All union council chairmen will lead their separate rallies and join the main rally led by Hanif Abbasi and Sardar Naseem in the city and Malik Abrar and Daniyal Chaudhry in the cantonment areas.
Talking to Dawn, Mayor Sardar Naseem said his party’s workers would welcome the rally led by Maryam Nawaz and Hamza Shehbaz and join them on their way to Islamabad.
“All party workers and supporters will go to Islamabad in the shape of rallies led by former MNA Hanif Abbasi, former MPAs Raja Hanif, Ziaullah Shah and others. Women wing, youth wing, student federation and minority and labour wings will bring their separate rallies,” Mr Naseem said.
He said the PML-N had finalised the plan to counter arrest and if the interior ministry tried to sabotage their peaceful rally, party workers from every street and area of the garrison city would foil its attempt.
“Rawalpindi is the fort of the PML-N which can be seen from the results of the local government elections in the cantonment areas from where not a single PTI member got elected,” he added.
He said in the last three years, the PTI government had done nothing for the residents of Rawalpindi and now Imran Khan had threatened to bring people to Islamabad.
“In Rawalpindi, many PTI local leaders are contacting PML-N as they want to join the party,” he claimed.

2022-03-31,2022-03-21,Over 50pc independent female candidates contesting local govt polls in KP,ISLAMABAD: The independent women contestants outnumbered the combined tally of women candidates fielded by the...,"ISLAMABAD: The independent women contestants outnumbered the combined tally of women candidates fielded by the political parties for the Neighborhood and Village Councils in the second phase of local government elections being held in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) on March 31.
Overall, the independent female candidates constitute 51pc as against 27pc and 22pc women fielded by liberal and religious parties respectively.
This was revealed by Pattan, an NGO that works for democracy, human rights and gender equality in a report released here on Sunday.
It said reserved seats remained vacant or being won without any contest, a phenomenon that had also been seen in the first phase of the polls.
According to Pattan, lack of political will appears to be mainly responsible for low rate of female participation in local elections.
The second phase of local election shows that on an average only 1.76 female candidates are in the field against one seat, while seat to candidate ratio on other categories of seats is much high. For instance, on average there are 10 candidates against one seat for chairmen/mayor category.
Pattan argues that prior conditions (female literacy rate, human development level, women’s participation in labour force and access to public life, etc.,) appear to have played a major role in determining the level of women’s participation in the election.
Because of the existing differentiation, women’s participation as candidates varies from district to district. For instance, in Lower and Upper Kohistan – extremely poor and underdeveloped districts --about 90pc women seats remained vacant. 
In Battagram, out of total 90 female seats as many as 71 or 79pc remained vacant.
In South Waziristan too, more than 68pc of female seats remained vacant, while in Abbottabad, only 32 or 15pc of the 209 seats are vacant. 
In Upper Chitral, female candidates did not leave a single seat vacant.
However, there appears significant variations across districts. 
For instance, share of religious parties is higher than liberal parties in six districts - Mansehra 16pc, North Waziristan 36pc and Kurram 36pc, and Orakzai 32%. The liberal parties have clear edge over religious parties in eight districts - Upper Chitral 33pc, Lower Dir 49pc, Malakand 44pc, Shangla 43pc, Swat 50pc and Upper Dir 57pc. 
In 11 districts the independent candidates constitute clear majority in comparison to combined strength of all parties. 
In Abbottabad 88pc, Battagram 94pc, Upper Chitral 56pc, Lower Chitral 64pc, Mansehra 84pc, North Waziristan 53pc, South Waziristan 81pc, Orakzai 56pc, and Shangla 50pc.
Analysis of the contestation data (ECP Form X List of Contesting Candidates) also reveals some interesting socio-political trends:
1) High participation of female candidates even in the conservative or traditional districts than the combined female candidates of political parties is a clear sign of emergence of new social forces that are ready to play an important role in local governance.
2) Political parties appear to be ignorant of their emergence and have little appetite to broaden and deepen democracy and to avail this opportunity.
3) Political parties seem to be more interested in top positions i.e. mayors and chairpersons than in the quota seats of the marginalised sections of the society.
4) As a large number of women seats will remain vacant even after by-election female populations of many Neighborhood and Village Councils of KPK are likely to be deprived of women representatives.
Pattan’s analysis is primarily based on the ECP’s Form X (list of contesting candidates) of 17 districts.
The Pattan in it’s recommendations said the ECP should make available data and forms of every election promptly.
It said political parties need to invest resources to set up party chapters at grassroots level and must also hold internal party election and ECP should monitor their polling processes.
It also said civil society, women groups and trade unions should plan to field candidates against quota seats.

2022-03-20,2022-03-21,Moot on patient safety calls for moving towards medical home care,PM’s aide Dr Sultan says 20pc to 40pc of health spending wasted due to poor quality care...,"KARACHI: The 5th international conference on patient safety concluded at the Liaquat National Hospital (LNH) on Sunday with messages for moving towards people-centred care and increased use of technology to tackle growing healthcare challenges and burden on hospitals.
The event —Implementation research in healthcare quality and safety — was organised by Riphah Institute of Healthcare Improvement & Safety in partnership with World Health Organisation, Imperial College London, City University London, National Institute of Health, Islamabad and Martin Dow Group.
The conference covered topics ranging from infection prevention and control, patient safety in dentistry, role of nursing, implementation of health policies and research, to leadership in healthcare, pharmacovigilance and the role of virtual reality in surgical training.
In his recorded message, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health Dr Faisal Sultan explained why it’s important to focus on patient safety. “This is a serious health issue requiring our immediate attention. Better safety measures improve patient experience, health outcomes, well-being of the healthcare team as well as reduce costs,” he said.

PM’s aide Dr Sultan says 20pc to 40pc of health spending wasted due to poor quality care

Globally, Dr Sultan pointed out, 20 per cent to 40pc of health spending went wasted due to poor quality care and 15pc of hospital costs were on account of harm caused to patients.
“These statistics remind us that patient safety is critical in healthcare. In Pakistan, we need to move towards people-centred care, while paying attention to public health needs and expectations of the community to improve patient safety.”
He appreciated efforts on part of the event organisers and said discussions on the forum would encourage stakeholders to take practical measures in this field.
AI transforming healthcare future
In a session on the future of healthcare, LNH medical director Dr Salman Faridi said artificial intelligence was transforming the future of healthcare as it provided several advantages over traditional clinical decision-making.
On medical error reduction and prevention, he said chances of errors during treatment always existed and like other professionals, doctors should also be forgiven for the error.
In his presentation, Dr Zakiuddin said there was an immediate need to introduce the concept of ‘homspital’ in society where patients were provided healthcare services at home.
“There are several factors in play leading to the emergence of a new hospital structure. These forces include changes in patient population and their needs, advances in clinical knowledge and technology, impact of digital technology, higher patient expectation, difficulties in attracting and retaining an appropriate skilled workforce, financial and funding challenges and growing requirements to measure quality.”
Sharing some data on digital medical / health applications, he said their numbers were increasing rapidly. “Currently, we have 300,000 apps on iOS and Android compared to the approximately 165,000 available in 2015.”
Dr Zakiuddin concluded his presentation by emphasising that doctors and nurses were facing burnouts and to prevent them, the phenomenon of ‘homspital’ should be introduced as soon as possible.
Sindh Health Minister Azra Fazal Pechuho, Prof Paul Barach of Wayne State University, Dr Aziz Sheikh from the University of Edinburgh and Prof Allen Meador from the University of North Carolina, were among the speakers.

Khuhro said at a press conference at Larkana Press Club on Sunday that speaker of National Assembly had acted unconstitutionally by convening session on March 25. 
The opposition had submitted requisition on March 8 after which he was to convene the session within 14 days but if voting on no-confidence motion was not carried out on the date and attempt was made to impose governor’s rule in Sindh, it would prove disastrous, he warned. 
He said the speaker could not prorogue the session without going ahead with no-trust motion the day the session was convened. By holding the session late, the prime minister had attempted to make the speaker a scapegoat, he said. 
He dismissed claims of international conspiracy behind the no-confidence move and said that parliament itself was all powerful to decide about the fate of its prime minister.
Khuhro said that certain PTI members were served with notices for merely not attending the party session and said they could not be disqualified before exercising their vote in favour of opposition’s move. 
He said the government had adopted the strategy to hold public meeting on the day of the no-trust vote to threaten their members with the presence of charged crowd before whom they would have to walk to the assembly and return. It spoke volumes that PTI was short of required numbers, he said.
About possible PPP-MQM alliance, Khuhro argued that PPP had forged alliance with the party in 1988 and 2008 as well and it made no difference if it did it again. However, PPP had reservations over MQM’s stand on integrity of Sindh and demand for new province, he said. 
Reservations over implementation on 40:60 formula in jobs and resources would be sorted out, he said and challenged ruling party to impose governor’s rule in Sindh. It was a mere ‘dream’ after the 18th Amendment, he said. 
He spoke about fissures in the PTI and claimed that currently there were four groups in the party while its allies had taken a clear stand over no-confidence motion. 
He said in a sarcastic tone it was all right when members were brought on planes in 2018 election, but the same were now being branded ‘turncoats’ and traitors’ when they were not ready to stand by Imran Khan.

Malir SSP Irfan Bahadur said that Constable Faisal alias Nadeem lived near Daud Chowrangi and when he reached home after finishing his duty his neighbour Ahmed informed him that his father, Majeed Hameed, had been threatening neighbours with a pistol and asked him to try and talk some sense into his father along with him.

2018-01-27,2022-03-21,"Depression, stress on the rise among Karachi youth, say researchers","Study conducted by NED University’s AI lab on 3,000 individuals will help treat mental issues, experts say.","KARACHI: A latest scientific study, which is part of a world-level publication, has found that levels of depression, anxiety and stress are growing mainly among the young population of Karachi.
The impact of Covid-19 pandemic has further worsened the psychological situation as in some cases the number of people suffering from such conditions has increased by 40 per cent.
The facts emerged in the data collected through a scientific research being conducted by the NED University of Engineering and Technology that had studied more than 3,000 individuals at its Neurocomputation Lab, which is one of the nine facilities set up under the National Centre of Artificial Intelligence (NCAI).
The study, experts believe, would help devise new modified strategies on diagnosis and treatment of mental health issues.
“We carried out the study on 3,000 individuals,” said Dr Muhammad Abul Hasan, associate professor at the biomedical engineering department of NED University.

Study conducted by NED University’s AI lab on 3,000 individuals will help treat mental issues

He said: “In post-Covid scenario we have found that issues of anxiety and stress have increased between 35pc to 40pc after the pandemic hit the country. This increase of percentage has been found among those who are suffering from mild and moderate psychological issues. 
“The alarming thing is that we have also recorded extreme and severe cases and in this category we have found that 28pc cases of depression have increased followed by 27pc in anxiety and 22pc in stress,” Dr Hasan said.
Despite being an engineering university, the institution was working in fields of neurosciences and neuropsychology, where the teams of researchers were exploring ‘neurological biomarkers’ of mental health, he added.
The part of the study, he said, also required that how all these biomarkers after being identified could be reversed.
Explaining neurological biomarkers, Dr Hasan, who is also the co-principal investigator at the Neuro Computation Lab, said: “Whenever we go through any psychological problem, it changes the brain patterns. There are regions in the brain. These regions have connections among them. After any psychological problem, these connections receive the impact. They may get stronger or in some cases weaker. Sometimes they disappear and sometimes new connections emerge. So basically we study these connections and analyse that they can be reversed.”
The experts believe once the research is compiled and becomes part of a global study, it would be a big achievement of Pakistani researchers, who are leading the exercise with international collaboration of the University of Glasgow, Stanford University, the Monash University Australia and the Denmark Technological University under the NCAI programme.
Vision 2025
The NCAI is the technological initiative of the federal government under its ‘Vision 2025’.
The centre is designed to become a leading hub of innovation, scientific research, knowledge transfer to the local economy, and training in the area of AI and its closely affiliated fields.
The aim of the centre is to facilitate researchers in the field of AI; help them establish and grow AI industry following international trends and seek solutions to the indigenous problems through AI.
Approved in January 2018, the NCAI is designed on a consortium model where the most leading researchers in the field of AI are identified on competitive grounds and new state-of-the-art laboratories are established under their supervision. 
As research on the mental health issues in the wake of post-pandemic scenario enters the final phase, it has raised the hopes of researchers and experts that it would go a long way both for medical science professionals and health scientists.
‘Replace traditional treatment’
“The technology has two roles when it comes to health sciences,” said Dr Saad Ahmed Qazi, dean of faculty of computer engineering at the NED University.
“One is about diagnostic, where it helps you finding timely and accurate health issues and problems. The other is about remedial action. In technology, there are several neuro-modulation techniques, which can be used for effective and durable treatment.”
He said the university’s study would help replace the traditional way of treatment in mental health and it would gradually make things easy both for the medical science professionals and people suffering from such conditions.
“In mental health issues we largely see the counselling as one of the key tools for treatment. So we can say that it [technology] gives you an opportunity to go a step forward from the conventional way of treatment and here we can capitalise on the benefits of the technology which ultimately benefits a common man,” said Dr Qazi.

The fresh determination was demonstrated in a rally in Laasi Goth, Malir on Sunday, where the participants vowed to continue their struggle for ‘Naya Pakistan’ and described the founder of their party as the only hope for a prosperous and corruption-free Pakistan. 
Leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh told the rally that PM Khan emerged as the leader of Ummah as he has raised the issue of Namoos-i-Risalat (PBUH) on all international forums and played a pivotal role in approval and passage of a historic resolution against Islamophobia in the United Nations.
He said he was the leader who had given Pakistan a sovereign and independent foreign policy by saying ‘absolutely not’ on a question of handing over air bases to a foreign power. 
The people of Sindh in a large numbers are ready to depart for the federal capital and caravans of over 1,000 vehicles are being prepared while a train is booked as well, he announced. 
“It is so unfortunate that Sindh House in Islamabad is being used for horse-trading, which creates a negative perception of Sindh across the country and caused embarrassment to the people of the province,” said Mr Sheikh.

Meanwhile, PTI workers staged a protest demonstration outside the residence of disgruntled party MNA Ramesh Kumar. 
Carrying placards and party flags, they chanted slogans and warned the MNA about public reaction against his decision to vote against PM Khan in the upcoming no-confidence resolution.

Introducing Sherry as an experienced editor and politician, Bandial said she has done a great job of compiling, editing and publishing the collection of essays by 22 Pakistani women writers. 
Sherry, explaining the inspiration behind publishing the book, said the essays contextualize the place of women in the Pakistani settings, where they are struggling for space and identity. She said despite materialistic progress, women still needed to explain themselves. These explanations are about the available space and the space being sought, and about their identity. She said our societal values and family norms held back all women under the cover of narratives laced with modesty and loyalty. 
The moderator took the discussion to feminism, which challenges societal chains. 
Sherry said that to her, feminism is a way of life. “Yes, it’s a way of life, where instead of focusing on that how others think about you, feminism teaches how you think about other people.” 
She said feminism had redefined women. It gave a chance for women to be courageous and speak out on the matters that matter.  Sherry also differentiated between the first women’s activism exhibited during the Zia rule and the ongoing Aurat March. During the 80s, the women challenged state oppression, draconian laws and shrinking space for women. 
The Aurat March had no such challenges to take on. But the looming threat for Aurat March was extremists’ threats. She said Aurat March needed broader engagement to make it a march of the masses. It needs a ceaseless struggle. It needs women to explain to the detractors that ‘mera jism, meri marzi’ is about free will marriage, and about having choices regarding birth planning. She urged women, and civil society to get engaged with political parties for a broader change. 
The session, which otherwise was wonderful, faced technological constraints. 
ARE YOU ENJOYING?: Actress and short-story writer Mira Sethi’s debut story collection has only one purpose: she writes to see and to be seen. At the launch of her book, she with moderator actor Adnan Malik spoke about the characters and settings of her stories. She said the book was written in English to reach wider audiences, but the stories only represent localism.
Since she is not good at Urdu, she chose English to express herself. She had a disclaimer: English houses my intellect, but not my heart.
To keep the flavour of the characters and language original and local, she frequently uses desi words in her stories without explaining them. She said foreign publishers are always sceptical about non-western writers’ work and would ask them asked about the approach of their work. She said her fiction work only aimed at bringing out Pakistani culture to the world. Being a performing art person herself, Mira has several professional performers in her stories. She also spoke on the subjects of ongoing drama serials, saying that marriages, especially the bad marriages, were the ‘in’ things, but the trend would not produce strong women in our society.   
Mira is now celebrating the success of her debut work; she has no plan to bring out her second book right now. 
“Writing is an exhaustive work, so for now, I’m just concentrating on acting projects,” she said.

2022-01-27,2022-03-21,‘Fear is state’s handy tool to suppress dissent’,"Nothing could be sacred in a country, where the constitution is not held sacred, says leftist activist and academic...","Nothing could be sacred in a country, where the constitution is not held sacred, says leftist activist and academic Ammar Ali Jan at a session on the last day of the Lahore Literary Festival held at Alhamra, The Mall, where his book ‘Rule by Fear’ was launched on Sunday.
At the session moderated by senior journalist and TV anchor Mujahid Barelvi, Jan, also founder president of his Left-oriented Huqooq-i-Khalq movement, said his book opens with one of the the darkest episodes of Indian History, Jallianwala Bagh carnage occurred at Amritsar (now India) on 13th of April, 1919. On the day, British Indian army opened indiscriminate fire on peaceful protesters, killing, as per some accounts, up to 1,500 people, on the orders of Gen Dyer.  
Jan mentions that Gen Dyer ordered the massacre just to instill fear among the Indians so that they could never think of rising against the British rulers and that state was still using the tool of fear to subjugate people demanding their rights.
Sindh University Jamshoro Assistant Professor Amar Sindhu said Jan’s book presents the case of marginalised communities. She said the most damaging thing state has done is that it erased the nation’s memory of the atrocities committed against the people, including attempts to snatch their rights, and instilled fear and uncertainty in its collective consciousness.  
She regretted that the post-Zia generation was unaware of the state oppression because they just remember Musharraf regime. She said military dictator Gen Zia ruthlessly used fear as a tool to suppress dissent, and put its opponents in the torture cells in Lahore Fort. “Whenever a government of people would take charge, Lahore Fort would be converted into a ‘museum of torture’,” she added.
Peshawar-based human rights activist Shahida Shah referred to Dalton’s theory of structural violence to expound state’s employment of torture and other forms of violence to suppress people. She said for her activism was a natural option given the political and social conditions in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa where there was an atmosphere of fear and suffocation.  
To Mr Barelvi’s question that why Pakistan’s leftists could not so far make a united front to struggle for achieving their common objectives, Jan said the Left was systematically rendered disorganised because of conspiracies. He said a scattered fight was being fought by the leftists in various parts of the country, stressing the need for unity among various leftist factions. He said the situation was, however, improving as a younger generation of Punjabi leftists were supporting their comrades from other provinces like Balochistan. In this regard he mentioned support of Punjabi students of Punjab university for the Baloch students.  
Amar Sindhu was of the opinion that leftists should not have detached themselves from local and regional issues. She regretted that public domain had been left to the mullah (rigid religious people).

The Taliban came...,"People say that Pakistan created the Taliban but it’s wrong though we might take a credit for it. The Taliban came into existence through the truck mafia, said former foreign secretary Najmuddin A. Shaikh.  
“When they used to go to Kandahar, they had to pass eight to 10 checkpoints where they had to pay a fine. The truck mafia said to the seminary students and ordinary sepoys, who were not Taliban to give it a safe passage and requested them to provide it and they did that,” he said while speaking in a session, The Imperial Ghost Wars in Afghanistan on the concluding day of the Lahore Literary Festival (LLF) on Sunday. 
“Then we said, ‘the Taliban are our boys’ but the Taliban did not accept that and told that Naseerullah Babar had nothing to do with them.” 
Mr Shaikh added that Osama bin Laden went to Afghanistan in a C-31, which was only possible through the US government. “I was then the foreign secretary. I wrote to our intelligence agencies to keep a watch on him because his presence there was going to create problems for us.” 
He termed peace in Afghanistan essential for Pakistan because any disturbance there would multiply in Pakistan.  
Former ambassador to the US Maleeha Lodhi said that for Pakistan, the US was part of an external strategy to counter India’s threatening posture with Pakistan. She said the relationship has been very mercurial, problematic and turbulent and it was best when the both sides had common objectives like both sides wanted US withdrawal from Afghanistan, both sides wanted the dissemination of Al-Qaida.  
“We are in a transitional phase. It is hard to see how the new relationship is going to be redefined unless there is meaningful engagement at the senior level which I am not seeing so far. Perhaps the US has other issues now in mind vis-à-vis Ukraine.”  
Ms Lodhi said the relationship is going to be affected by three factors, the Sino-US confrontation, India factor as Pak-India relations are not normalised and the situation of Afghanistan where Pakistan wanted a greater engagement.  
Writer and journalist Zahid Hussain said US-Pakistan relations had gone through many phases in the last sixty years but a new alliance emerged after 9/11. “Before 9/11 happened, the US and Pakistan were pursuing different policies in Afghanistan but things changed after 9/11.” 
He said after the incident, Pakistan was important for the US to engage in Afghanistan as the mastermind of 9/11 was living there and Pakistan was deeply involved in Afghanistan before that.  
“There had been a lot of political statements by political leaders that ‘one call’ led to Pakistan’s alliance with the US which was completely wrong. Pakistan did not have a choice.” 
After the return of US forces from Afghanistan, the nature of relations had completely changed and they had gone back to the same situation that was before 9/11, he said. 
Zahid Hussain added that there had been a lot of talk that the US had betrayed Pakistan but one thing should be clear that nations make their relations based on their national interests.  
He said when Taliban ruled Afghanistan before 9/11, there were no Taliban fighting in Pakistan but now the TTP had emboldened, and its back in the former tribal areas of Pakistan which should be a concern for Pakistan.  
AKBAR ZAIDI: Political economist Akbar S. Zaidi talking about his book, Making of A Muslim, said many things told about Pakistan and the Muslims of 19th century were wrong. 
“I was intrigued by the idea how the idea of a Muslim is portrayed in history, social sciences by very prominent historians, including the one who was here yesterday but I can’t take the name.  
“There was a region in Hindustan where everything was written in Urdu and our historians, with some exceptions, don’t read Urdu despite writing extensive books.”  
Mr Zaidi said the crux of this book was to explore what were the Muslims talking about in the 19th century, adding that he read newspapers from that era, exploring the Khuda Bakhsh Library in Patna, Aligarh Library and British Library. 
He said contemporary historians claim that a Muslim nation came into being after 1857. “I refuse to accept it. There was nothing like it.” 
He declared there was no better word than Zillat (humiliation). “The book has many themes and there is one theme of Zillat.”  
The Urdu speaking elite realised that the condition they were in was utter Zillat.  
“People think that the sects of Islam, Deobandi, Barelvi and Ahle Hadith, had been there since centuries. In 1867, the Deoband sect started, the Barelvis came in 1895 and Ahle Hadith originated in 1870-1875. These sects are just infants compared to the 1,400 years long history of Islam.” 
Talking about his book again, Mr Zaidi said his argument was that due to the Zillat of 1857, Aligarh came into being, Sir Syed appeared, and all Muslim sects came into being. “In Aligarh of 19th century, Ghalib was not taught and you could not talk about Urdu poetry. Keats was taught. There were a Union club and English debating club,” he said.  
“Calling Sir Syed as an educationist is bullshit. Aligarh’s objective was getting jobs and not knowledge,” Mr Zaidi declared.

Mr Natiq remarked that poets have been there since the world was created, sharing that a poet can write aghazal, but everyghazalwriter can’t be a poet. He called himself a storyteller while writing poetry.
“A poet is someone who loiters aimlessly (awara gard); he talks to the trees, stars and what not. Everything in the world was created beautiful, it is us who have distorted them,” he reflected. 
The poet then talks about the use of istaara (metaphor), saying mushahida (observation) is the most important element in poetry. “Things change as we move from one location to another. So if you keep writing as you go along in life, it’ll appear fresh and attract many more readers. Poetry should make people happy; it should give them confidence about life.”
Natiq then read out some versesfrom the book under discussion.
When asked about a lot of focus on nature in his poetry, Natiq gave an example that no hotel anywhere in the world could beat lying on a charpoy under ajaamantree by a waterway with a book for company. “Nature provides a person a shadow; humans are bound for life with trees and poetry is all about love and care, which nature provides in abundance.”
The moderator asked him about his philosophy of life in terms of him having a strong voice against injustices. “If justice (adal) ends from the world, life will come to an end. The objective of poetry is to speak the truth, and if you don’t then you justify the injustice. There is no compromise on it. People make friends, but I’m known for making enemies because of opinions. History will only remember those who stand on the right side.”
Mr Natiq concluded by revealing he was working on his autobiography that will be “honest and interesting”.
Video games
Video game connoisseurs gathered to listen to art historian and ethnologist Jean-Baptiste Clais talk about his passion for the games, contemporary pop culture that he specialises in, how he put together an exhibition about video games and their connection with culture, cinema, and art.
At the start of the session, ‘Video Games as a New Domain of Creation’, moderated by digital storyteller/journalist Mariam Saeed Khan at Lahore Literary Festival, Mr Clais gave a presentation on the market shares of different video game systems, the evolution of graphics of video games and glimpses into the first video games exhibition.
Talking about the exhibition, he said since the game had to be visualised, simple colours had to be used to get public attention. “Games are inspired by the real world, includingmovies, cartoons and television, while video games also exert their influence on these media.”
When Ms Khan asked what his favourite video game was, he said there were none since as a child he wasn’t allowed to play them. “I bought a computer when I became an adult and started playing then only.”
The objective of a non-profit he volunteers for, he shared, is to maintain digital heritage, organise shows and exhibitions and display gaming machines to explain to people, especially parents, how they work.“There’s so much beauty and poetry and art out there and wonderful games.Video gaming can be shaped in so many contexts. You have to find an angle that makes it interesting. Museums are there for the community that thinks games are a part of them and their lives; they’ll cease to exist once people stop playing games.”

Addressing a dinner reception given by the Pakistan Economic Conference (PEC) in collaboration with the Faisalabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FCCI), he said the government has finally decided to devolve the Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation (PTDC) to provinces. He said all PTDC hotels, motels and other assets would be transferred to provinces under the condition that they would hand over the same to the private sector within a period of two months.
He said the government was not meant to run businesses but play the role of facilitator. He said 33 to 35 motels were lying closed for the last 10 years, as the job had been entrusted to irrelevant persons. He said the PTDC would be restructured. A national-level e-portal on tourism was ready, which would be launched by Prime Minister Imran Khan soon.
He said that a one-stop website had been developed which would have all related information about tourism sites and their managements. The government has identified the potential tourist attractions in which local and national investors could provide required facilities, he added.
He said a concept of village tourism had been introduced, which would also play a major role in promoting the country’s cultural diversity. It was a World Bank-funded project, which would attract foreign tourists to visit scenic valleys of northern areas. Similarly, a ski resort would also be developed in Chitral, which would be a unique attraction for domestic and foreign tourists, he added.
Stressing the importance of a road communication system, he said that it was very strange that a 300km stretch of Silk Road had no bathroom, which was basic and fundamental requirement of any tourist. The government is working for standardising hotels in addition to other allied services, he added.
He said qualified professionals were required to manage the hospitality industry and in this connection, schools were being established in different parts of the country.
Mr Jamil also gave a comprehensive presentation about the potential of tourism in Pakistan with steps being taken by the government to engage the private sector.
Provincial Minister for Culture and Industries Khayal Ahmad Kastro also spoke on the occasion and said that for the first time in the history of the province, the Punjab Culture Day was observed on March 14.
He said being the minister for colonies, he retrieved 200,000 acres of state land, encroached upon by land-grabbers. The value of the land was around Rs450 billion, he added.
He paid tribute to PM Khan for organising a foreign ministers’ conference of Islamic countries and said that his strategy played a pivotal role in the revival of the industrial sector in Pakistan.
Deputy Commissioner of Faisalabad Ali Shehzad also spoke on the occasion, while former president of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) Mian Mohammad Idrees and FCCI President Atif Munir Sheikh along with PEC organiser Azhar Chaudhry presented FCCI shields to Mr Jamil.

2322-03-21,2022-03-21,Literary notes: Some incorrectly attributed Urdu & Persian literary works,"THE word ‘pseudo’ means not genuine, false. And ‘epigraph’ means an inscription. Therefore, falsely...","THE word ‘pseudo’ means not genuine, false. And ‘epigraph’ means an inscription. Therefore, falsely attributed texts are sometimes referred to as ‘pseudepigraphs’ in literary criticism. 
A misattributed or ‘pseudegraphic’ text is the work whose generally known author is not the real author and it turns out to have actually been written by someone else. Incorrectly attributed literary works are not always result of literary forgeries and sometimes misattribution is unintentional, though plagiarists and cheats do involve in such malpractices. 
Richard D. Altick (1915-2008) is considered a world authority on research methodology. On misattribution he says that we have “to identify the author of anonymous or pseudonymous works (or works attributed to the wrong writer); to decide which parts of a work written by two or more authors belong to whom; and to remove from the received list of a writer’s works whatever pieces are not his, thereby purifying his canon (the roster of his authentic writings)”. 
In our literary history, we come across works that have been attributed to authors who did not pen them. Such studies are known, in Urdu, as ‘tehqeeq-i-mansoobaat’, or research on misattributions. Some of our scholars have busted many myths. Revisiting these facts would be of interest: 
General perception about Qissa Chahar Durvesh was that it was originally written in Persian by Ameer Khusrau, but Hafiz Mahmood Sherani proved that it was written in Mughal era, some 300 years later than Khusrau’s era, though various Urdu versions are based on Persian texts. 
M’eraaj-ul-Aashiqeen, a work on Sufism, was edited by Moulvi Abdul Haq and he said it was penned by Hazrat Syed Muhammad Husaini Banda Nawaz Gesu Daraaz. Dr Husaini Shahid and, later on, Dr Hafeez Qateel, proved that it was not written by Hazrat Gesu Daraaz but a shorter version of Tilavat-ul-Vujood, a work by Makhdoom Shah Husaini. 
It was commonly believed that Firdousi had composed a hajv (lampoon) to vent his resentment against Mahmood Ghaznavi, but Hafiz Mahmood Sherani proved that some of the couplets included in the so-called hajv were composed by some other poets and a few others were taken out of contest from Firdousi’s Shah nama and joined together with some fake verses. He also proved that the number of couplets in Mahmood’s hajv kept on increasing in numbers with the passage of time. 
A booklet named Risala-i-Kashf-ul-Asraar is attributed to Hazrat Ali Bin Usman Hajveri, popularly known as Data Ganj Bakhsh. Hakeem Muhammad Moosa Amritsari proved that the attribution is false, and perhaps intentional, as it is written in ‘Sabk-i-Hindi’, or Indian style of Persian, and Hazrat Data Sahib’s Kashf-ul-Mahjoob is in a prose style belonging to Samanid or Samanian era. 
Naval Kishor, the famous publisher from Lucknow, had published several editions of Divan-i-Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti Ajmeri. Hafiz Mahmood Sherani proved that no critic had mentioned Khwaja Ajmeri’s poetry until 500 years after his death and the attribution is incorrect. Sherani wrote that it might have been penned by Maulana Moinuddin Bin Sharafuddin. 
Dr Ghulam Mustafa Khan wrote that a Persian divan published by Naval Kishor (5th edition, 1883) is wrongly attributed to Hazrat Abdul Qadir Jeelani. He has cited certain evidences that prove his point of view and establish the fact that the divan is not authored by Hazrat Abdul Qadir Jeelani. 
Dr Nazeer Ahmed has written that there are some quatrains in the divan of Hafiz Sherazi that were not written by Hafiz as these quatrains are included in Nuzhat-ul-Majalis. We know that Nuzhat-ul-Majalis, an anthology of quatrains, was compiled in 13th century AD and Hafiz was born in 14th century AD. 
Mazhar-ul-A’jaaib, is attributed to Fareeduddin Attar, but Khaliq Anjum wrote that it was written by someone else and attributed to Attar with religious motives. 
Khaliq Anjum wrote that most of the books attributed to the Sufis of Chishtiya order are either fake or misattributed. 
Qazi Abdul Wadood proved that Gulistan-i-Sukhan was written by Imam Bakhsh Sebhai and its attribution to Mirza Qadir Bakhsh Sabir is incorrect. 
Some manuscripts of Mirza Sauda’s kulliyaat (collected works) have verses that were not composed by Sauda, wrote Khaliq Anjum and Rasheed Hasan Khan. Such interpolations are not uncommon in classical Urdu poetry manuscripts. 
Hafiz Mahmood Sherani wrote that Khaliq Bari was not written by Ameer Khusrau and its original author was someone else also named Khusrau. 
It is a known fact that Mirza Ghalib wrote the book Lataaif-i-Ghaibi to defend himself but put his friend Miandad Khan Sayyah’s name on its title as author. 
It is a misconception that Divan-i-Makhfi was written by Zaibunnisa Makhfi, daughter of Aurangzeb Alamgir. 
Facts about suspected or incorrect attributions presented in this piece have been collected from different sources, especially an issue of Tehqeeq, a research journal edited by Dr Najm-ul-Islam. Some are from Khaliq Anjum’s book Matni Tanqeed.

“We are ready to provide complete protection to the visiting national and international players, as well as spectators, during the series,” he said, adding the security plan was more elaborate than that of previous matches.  
Pakistan and Australia will play one test match, three one-day international matches and one T-20 match in Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium from March 21 to April 5.
According to the security plan, more than 8,000 police officials, including SPs, SDPOs, SHOs from Dolphin Squad, Police Response Unit and Elite Force, will perform security, patrolling and traffic management duties during the matches.
Australian players and officials have been given the status of state guests, according to the government directions.  
The CCPO said close circuit TV cameras around the stadium and parking areas had been made fully operational to ensure strict vigilance during the cricket series.  
He said efforts would be made to ensure that the routine activities of the people, especially of traders and businessmen, were least disturbed during the matches.  
He said ‘zero route’ would be provided to the teams to ensure their security by containing traffic only during their movement from the residential places to the stadium and vice versa.  
He said four-layer security would be ensured at the stadium and spectators would only be allowed to enter after a thorough checking process. The Covid-19 protocols would also be followed, he added.  
Dev said round-the-clock monitoring of the residential places of teams, routes, matches and movement of players had been ensured through CCTV cameras, while snipers would be deployed on the rooftops of buildings during the matches.  
He said search and sweep operations were also being conducted on a daily basis in the city, particularly around the stadium and in designated areas.  
The CCPO directed the officers concerned to coordinate with related departments, including the Punjab Safe Cities Authority, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), district administration and law enforcement agencies to successfully implement the security plan.

The academic year in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa usually starts in April and ends in March. The school administration conducts annual home exams up to grade-8 in March and results are declared on March 31 each academic year. 
However, in the light of the federal government’s decision, the E&SE Department has decided to start the upcoming academic year from August instead of April, saying the students’ time had been wasted when schools were closed due to Covid-19 pandemic at the start of the ongoing academic year. 
“Due to delay caused by the Covid-19 situation, the academic year 2022-23 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa shall commence from August 1, 2022, and conclude on April 30, 2023, and the academic year 2023-24 shall commence from May 1, 2023,” reads a notification issued by the education department in the start of March. 

Teachers fear wastage of time, say they had completed courses in February

A principal of a government high school told Dawn that in the ongoing academic year, classes started in July which continued non-stop for nine months. However, he said that the school administration could not take examinations from the students due to ‘illogical’ decision of the government. 
A science teacher in a government school told Dawn that he had completed teaching his courses at the end of January. “I have completed courses of three subjects, including chemistry and Physics for class-10, and general science for grade-8,” he said. 
As per the school principal’s directives, he said, the teachers had now engaged their students in different activities like revision of their courses, weekly tests, etc. 
Several principals of the government schools said the E&SE Department had not communicated to the schools in writing about annual home examinations. 
However, a district education officer said that a senior officer of education department had recently verbally communicated to the district education officers to issue directives to the government schools to conduct examinations by the end of May. 
In plain areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the summer vacation usually starts in government schools in June. 
“The teachers usually send their students for summer vacation with proper homework of the subjects taught in April and May, to be revised during the vacation,” a teacher said. 
However, he said, if they started the summer vacation at the start of June in the instant case, they would not be able to give homework to the students because they would not have started their next classes and thus the students would waste three months of summer vacation. 
School Officers Association, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, president Samiullah Khalil told Dawn that the association also had reservations about the start of academic year from August as it would waste precious time of the students. 
He said that the office-bearers of the teachers association raised this issue with the recently-posted secretary education in a meeting and demanded to revisit the decision of starting the academic year from August. 
He said it was clear in the education department’s notification that the next academic year would start from August, but it had not given any direction when the ongoing academic year would be ended. 
He said the association had also demanded of the government to hold annual home examinations in April. However, he said, the association could take its own decision of holding examinations in April in the larger interest of students.

2022-03-20,2022-03-21,Pakistan signs deal to avoid $11bn penalty in Reko Diq case,PM Imran congratulates the nation on the agreement for the development of the Reko Diq mine.,"ISLAMABAD: The government on Sunday claimed to have saved the country from $11 billion penalty in Reko Diq case and reconstituted a project aimed at excavating huge gold and copper reserves from the site in Balochistan. 
The federal and Balochistan governments and two international firms — Antofagasta PLC and Barrick Gold Corporation — have reached an agreement in principle on a framework to reconstitute the Reko Diq project, and a pathway for Antofagasta to exit the project. 
Prime Minister Imran Khan witnessed the signing ceremony. Speaking on the occasion, he expressed the hope that the investment would mark the beginning of large-scale investments in Balochistan that would change the quality of life of ordinary citizens in the province. 
Later, in a series of tweets, PM Khan congratulated the nation, specially the people of Balochistan, on the agreement for development of Reko Diq mine. 
“I congratulate the nation & ppl of Balochistan on successful agreement with Barrick Gold for development of Reko Diq mine after 10 years of legal battles & negotiations. Penalty of approx [approximately] $11bn is off set, $10bn will be invested in Balochistan creating 8,000 new jobs,” the prime minister tweeted. “RD [Reko Diq] will potentially be the largest gold & copper mine in the world. It will liberate us from crippling debt & usher in a new era of development & prosperity,” he wrote. 

 





 
Meanwhile, the Balochistan cabinet in a special session approved the agreement, terming it a game changer for the province. 
Later, addressing a press conference along with Energy Minister Hammad Azhar and Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo, Minister for Finance Shaukat Tarin said that after the signing of the agreement Pakistan would not only avoid the $11bn penalty but also get an opportunity to explore the world’s largest gold and copper reserve. 
He said some $10bn would be invested under the Reko Diq project which would create 8,000 new jobs for the locals. The minister said that as per the new agreement, Barrick Gold Corporation would get 50 per cent and the Balochistan government 25pc share, while the rest 25pc would be shared among the state-owned enterprises — Oil and Gas Development Company (OGDCL), Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) and Government Holdings Pakistan (GHPL). 
Mr Tarin recalled that the federal and Balochistan governments had in 2006 signed an agreement with Canadian company Barrick Gold and Chilean firm Antofagasta to extract gold and copper from Reko Diq mine. According to the deal, 37.5pc share each was given to the two foreign companies and 25pc to the Balochistan government. 
He said that agreement was suspended in 2011 due to a dispute over the legality of its licensing process. As a result, the Interna­tional Court of Arbitration levelled $6.4bn award on the government of Pakistan while at the same time the London Court of Arbitration was also imposing another $4bn fine on Pakistan. 
He said that soon after taking over the charge, PM Khan aggressively pursued the case. As a result, an agreement was signed on Sunday under which Antofagasta decided not to participate in the reconstituted project and withdrew from its claim of $3.9bn in place of $900 million, which would be paid by the three state-owned enterprises in return for a 25pc share. 
The minister said Pakistan, particularly Balochistan, would be benefited for over 100 years from this project and the total worth is estimated to be over $100bn. 
Terming the deal a landmark achievement, Energy Minister Hammad Azhar said it was a historic day as it had not only avoided $11bn worth of penalty but also created a new opportunity for the country. He said the “landmark success” had also saved the country from blacklisted by the FATF by implementing 32 of the 35 conditions.  
Meanwhile, President of Barrick Gold Mark Bristow had a meeting with Balochistan Chief Minister Qudoos Bizenjo after the signing of the agreement.

2022-03-20,2022-03-21,Dissidents to face social boycott: PM Imran,PM blames several media houses for siding with dacoits and taking money from foreign powers to topple govt.,"MALAKAND: Prime Minister Imran Khan has claimed that he has been advised by party colleagues to bring the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf dissidents back into the party fold by offering the same bribe as proffered by the opposition, but he rejected the advice telling them that he would rather prefer to lose his government than taking the path of horse-trading.
Addressing a public meeting in the Dargai area of Malakand on Sunday, Prime Minister Khan also criticised several media houses for ‘siding with the dacoits’ and blamed them for ‘selling out to foreign powers’. 
PM Khan, in his speech, also recounted all the achievements of his government, including record tax collection, exports and remittances, during the past three and a half months.
He alleged that the dacoits were using public money to buy PTI lawmakers but told the opposition that it was going to lose “this match”. He also vowed that he would never opt for horse-trading with public money, as the opposition did. However, he promised that like a father he would forgive the disgruntled PTI lawmakers, who had been ‘deceived’ by opposition parties to vote for no-trust motion against him, if they repented and returned to the party fold. At the same time, Mr Khan warned other dissatisfied PTI leaders, “Return to the party fold or face social boycott.” He urged the turncoats to think of their children and families, saying that they would lose respect and honour in society. “People will neither trust nor respect you. Masses are aware of whatever is happening in the country. This is the age of social media where it’s difficult to hide anything from them,” he asserted, adding that Changa Manga-like politics was not possible in the digital age.

Imran blames several media houses for siding with dacoits and taking money from foreign powers to topple govt

Talking about the mainstream media, PM Khan said the media had a major role in any democracy. “It is media duty to create awareness. To stand with the good, the biggest responsibility lies with the media. It must raise voice against evil. But I have to say it that unfortunately many media houses are getting money, several of them are receiving money from abroad. 
“And I leave it to the Pakistani nation that when you see the [section of] media you will find them standing with the dacoits who are destroying democracy. 
“If any foreign power wants to topple the government, how easy it is: just buy the loyalty of 20 hypocrites and the government will fall,” the prime minister said.
PM Khan also warned the media standing with the ‘dacoits’ [opposition], they should understand “the nation is watching you.” At this moment when the nation was on the two extremes, people were also watching which section of the media was standing with the country and its people and which one was standing with the dacoits, he asserted. 
Criticising Leader of Opposition in the National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif and other opposition party leaders, Mr Kahn said people could identify the ‘three stooges’ from the opposition who had been facing corruption cases for looting the country for years. He sounded confident the opposition would badly lose the match. He told the public meeting that a decisive moment had arrived in the history of Pakistan. He alleged that the corrupt mafia was offering bribes to the ruling party lawmakers to buy their loyalties with their ill-gotten money.
The judiciary, election commission and the nation were observing the situation, Mr Khan said. 
In the UK, he said, the members of parliament never sold their loyalties because they had strong democratic values and political insight. “They can never imagine such cheap tactics in politics,” he added.
The prime minister alleged that bags filled with stacks of money were being given to his party lawmakers at Sindh House, terming the action ‘funeral of democracy’. He appealed to the nation it was “your obligation to stand up and raise your voice against such tactics on part of the opposition parties”.
‘Foreign policy to favour people’
In his speech, PM Khan also lauded India for having an ‘independent’ foreign policy that was favourable to own people. He said he never bowed down before anyone and would not let the nation bow down. He said his foreign policy would also favour the people of Pakistan.
He maintained that he had said no to the European Union envoys who sought Pakistan support against Russia in the Ukraine conflict, because they broke protocol by making the joint statement public. Pakistan would have gained nothing by complying with the EU’s request, he said, adding that Pakistan being an independent country would not become part of any bloc.
He said Pakistan could not make progress if it remained slave to the world superpowers. He said the nation would not prosper until it stood on its own feet. Only hypocrites would never stand by the people, because they ‘worship money’, he remarked.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,"Detained in India, Pakistan’s Sumaira to return next week","Her husband, an Indian national, took her there without a visa via the Nepal border.","ISLAMABAD: Sumaira Rehman, a Pakistani woman languishing in a prison in Bangalore, India, is set to return to her home country next week along with her four-year-old daughter Sana Fatima.
“Indian authorities have completed all formalities for the release of the Pakistani woman. She is expected to arrive in Pakistan next week with her four-year-old daughter Sana Fatima,” PML-N Senator Irfan Siddiqui told Dawn by phone from Dubai.
Meanwhile, Suhana Biswa Patna, an Indian woman lawyer working for the release from the Bangalore prison and her repatriation to Pakistan, has thanked Senator Siddiqui for raising the issue of Ms Sumaira’s release and her repatriation to Pakistan.
“Allow me to thank you for raising the matter in the Senate. We would not have seen this day without your help,” Ms Patna, a leading Indian lawyer fighting for human rights, especially for jailed women, told Mr Siddiqui by phone.

Her husband, an Indian national, took her there without a visa via Nepal border

“Thank you sir for all your help. Both Sumaira and I are very grateful,” Ms Patna said in a message. Senator Siddiqui also appreciated Ms Patna’s efforts and thanked her.
Senator Siddiqui said that he was in touch with the Indian lawyer, Pakistan Foreign Office and Asma Jahangir Legal Aid Cell and was getting information on a daily basis.
He said that after the issuance of an NoC from the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs has also completed all formalities and it was working with Pakistani authorities to finalise arrangements for Ms Sumaira’s return to the country. It is likely that she, along with her daughter, would return home next week.
He said the state had to play an important role with regard to Ms Sumaira and her daughter, adding that after the Pakistani woman’s return to the country he would table a formal resolution in the Senate on the negligence and dereliction of duty by Pakistani officials concerned.
Ms Sumaira married an Indian national Mohammad Shihab of Palakkad, Kerala, whom she had met in Qatar.
Shihab took her to India without a visa in September 2016 via Nepal border. She was arrested in May 2017 and was subsequently sentenced to three years in prison.
Two months later, she gave birth to a baby girl. Her husband left her when she was in custody. Since her release from prison, Ms Sumaira has been living at a detention centre in Banga­lore with her daughter.
Pakistan had finally issued a citizenship certificate to Sumaira on February 17, paving the way for her return to Pakistan with her daughter.
The same day the certificate was communicated to Pakistan’s High Commission in New Delhi through the Foreign Office to instantly reach relevant authorities.
The certificate was issued after Senator Siddiqui raised the issue in the House twice in a week.

2022-03-24,2022-03-21,Trilateral talks on trans-Afghan rail project due next week,BoI chairman will interact with potential investors from many countries for B2B meetings in Tashkent.,"

STATE Minister and BoI chairman Azfar Ahsan.

 
ISLAMABAD: Senior officials of Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Afghanistan will meet in Tashkent next week for a trilateral meeting to discuss a potential railway project aimed at laying a railway track linking Termez, Mazar-i-Sharif, Kabul and Peshawar to promote trade in the region.
Minister of State and chairman of the Board of Investment (BoI) Azfar Ahsan has left Islamabad for Tashkent to participate in the trilateral meeting.
In addition to the trilateral meeting, Mr Ahsan will also participate in the Tashkent Inter­national Investment Forum which will be held from March 24 to 26.
The Uzbekistan president is taking special interest in the laying of the railway track with Pakistan via Afghanistan for its future trade and business activities. Uzbekistan, being a landlocked country, has been dependent on Iran’s trade routes for its imports and exports and the sanctions on Iran have made it difficult for Uzbekistan to continue using the same route.

BoI chairman will interact with potential investors from many countries for B2B meetings in Tashkent

The proposed railway connectivity has also been discussed at various international forums, including the Shanghai Coope­ration Organisation (SCO).
During his visit to Pakistan early this month, Uzbek Presi­dent Shavkat Mirziyoyev reaffirmed the important role of the railway project linking the three countries for the future of the region.
Pakistan and Uzbekistan have agreed to evolve a joint ‘roadmap’ which includes measures to develop a feasibility study for the project and start construction work on both sides.
The Trans-Afghan Railway project is stated to be the most economical and shortest route connecting Central Asia to Pakistan’s ports of Karachi, Gwadar and Port Qasim.
The two countries have already signed the bilateral Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA) and the enforcement of the Transit Trade Agreement. These agreements are the sign of the beginning of a new era in bilateral trade relations and will serve to increase mutual trade by utilising existing opportunities.
The Tashkent International Inves­tment Forum is being convened under the theme of “Realising New Growth Agenda” and expects to bring over 200 leaders from the government, busi­ness, civil society and academia to discuss and shape regio­nal as well as industry agendas.
The BoI chairman, who will be the keynote speaker at the inaugural session of the forum, will also meet Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev on the sidelines of the forum and will interact with potential investors from many countries as head of delegation from Pakistan for business-to-business (B2B) meetings.
An official of BoI says the visit of Mr Ahsan is being of paramount importance for Pakistan on diplomatic and economic front as it comes at a time when strategic ties between Uzbekistan and Pakistan are moving in an upward trajectory. 
The BoI chairman envisages that the visit will culminate into fruitful economic cooperation between the three countries and will further strengthen diplomatic and strategic ties.
The forum aims to explore areas of trilateral cooperation among Uzbekistan, Pakistan and Afghanistan and revolves around discussing the investment potential of Central Asia, transformations in trade flows in Central Asia, digitalisation of transport systems, attracting investments in tourism sector, production modernisation and new agricultural markets.
Mr Ahsan, during his visit, will also hold a meeting with Uzbek Minister of Transport I. Makhkamov and the head of the Afghan delegation in Termez. The discussions will centre on the available conditions of cargo transportation in Pakistan and proposals for increasing the volume of traffic between the three countries will be discussed from Pakistan’s perspective.

The newly appointed special prosecutor, Imtiaz  Siddiqui, is a senior lawyer based in Lahore and has vast experience in  handling corporate, banking and tax-related matters.
Sources said  Advocate Siddiqui would appear before a two-member Islamabad High Court  (IHC) bench, comprising Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, on Monday (today) and would lead the prosecution.
He  has been appointed in less than a month after NAB had brought a private lawyer, Mohammad Azhar Siddique, as its lead prosecutor for Ms Sharif’s  case.
Mr Siddique had put a single appearance before the IHC bench  last month and sought a month-long adjournment to prepare arguments. The hearing was then adjourned until March 21 (today). 
He had replaced Barrister Usman Cheema, also a private lawyer who had been appointed by NAB as its special prosecutor.
Prosecutor  Cheema skipped a couple of hearings and then sought another adjournment  for being Covid-19 positive. However, after recovery he recused himself  from the case. 
Earlier in September, NAB started pursuing  the appeal vigorously and even filed an application seeking day-to-day  hearings. But the bureau started seeking frequent adjournments  after the IHC bench raised questions on the admissibility of the  evidence produced before the trial court against Ms Sharif.

Presided over by party’s President Dr Malik Baloch, the NP’s central cabinet reviewed the agreement in detail and observed that foreign control over natural resources of the people of Balochistan was not acceptable for the party.
The participants of the meeting were of the opinion that the new agreement was a fraud with the people of Balochistan in the name of development. The meeting pledged not to allow the Balochistan government to sell out natural resources of the province at throwaway prices.
“The people of Balochistan and the National Party reject the Reko Diq Copper-Cum-Gold Project agreement outright,” said a statement issued by the party after its Central Cabinet meeting late Sunday night. 
It said the Balochistan government had ratified the agreement at its meeting of the provincial cabinet in which a majority of the cabinet members were not present, which proved the dishonesty of the provincial government in approving the agreement.
Besides, it said, the federal government had also lost its mandate after the tabling of a no-confidence motion against the prime minister in the National Assembly.
It said that the terms and conditions of the Reko Diq agreement had not been mentioned and they had been kept secret and, therefore, such an accord was not acceptable to the NP and the people of Balochistan as they were not aware of the details of the agreement. The party said the agreement was also unacceptable because it had been signed at a time when the country was witnessing political turmoil.

ANP provincial president Aimal Wali Khan said in a statement here on Sunday that despite repeated notices by the Election Commission of Pakistan the prime minister and his ministers were addressing public meetings to run campaign for his party candidates in the second phase of the local government elections, which was scheduled to be held on March 31. 
The ANP, he said, would not remain silent any longer on the issue and it would raise voice against the misuse of official resources. He said that spending of national wealth on the election campaign was illegal and thus his party would also move a court of law for taking action against the government. 
Aimal Wali said that the premier had lost majority in the National Assembly and he was legally bound to step down without any delay. He said that the opposition parties had taken a unified stand to oust the ‘selected’ government at the earliest. 
Referring to the PTI’s public meeting at Dargai in Malakand district, he claimed that the people belonging to Mardan, Batkhela and Swat had been provided free transport facilities, but even then they did not take interest to listen to the PM’s speech. 
The ANP provincial chief said that Imran Khan’s speech in Dargai was nothing more than a request to the deserting MPs of his party to rejoin him. He said that sooner or later the PM would step down to pave the way for fresh elections in the country.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,Police raid on musical concert in Peshawar brings censure from netizens,Official says action taken after local people’s complaints to avoid clash.,"PESHAWAR: The city police violently disrupted a private concert of Peshawar’s leading singer, Karan Khan, over the weekend, triggering a storm of protest and remonstration on the social media on part of some, while others supporting the police action.
On Friday night, police raided a music party in the neighbourhood of Nazirabad that fell in the Pishtakhara police dominion, saying it took action after the locals complained that a musical concert was held on Shab-i-Barat. They said they did so in order to preempt a possible clash between the locals and the organisers of the concert held at the farmhouse of Dilshad Afridi, a local resident.
“Police took action after complaints from the local people,” said a spokesperson of Pishtakhara police. “The people had gone to ask the organisers to stop the party several time but they did not do so.”
In addition to the locals who also asked via the social media platforms for action against the party, the police also received complaints from a seminary in the neighbourhood of the house, where the concert was held.

Official says action taken after local people’s complaints to avoid clash

However, the organisers said the police broke into the party, smashing musical instruments and arresting people. They said a bag full of money was also lost in the melee that ensued in wake of the police raid.
“We had gathered on the night of March 18 to celebrate the wedding of my friend with Karan Khan performing for some 100 guests,” said Dilshad Afridi. “The police suddenly raided the venue, manhandling the guests and breaking the instruments.”
The police said none of this happened. There was no use of force but the musicians were taken carefully to the police station under custody to protect them from the angry seminary students and for fear of confrontation. Later, Karan Khan and his band of musicians were released. According to the police spokesperson, nobody approached them to register a case for losing a money bag.
The incident led to heated protests on social media, amidst objections that the police action was uncalled for, with both political and social activists weighing in with the argument.
Mohsin Dawar of the National Democratic Movement took to Twitter saying, “Strongly condemn police attack on @karankhan music show in Peshawar. Police in other provinces provide security to music and cultural events while police in Peshawar attacks such events.” Dawar demanded that immediate punitive action should be taken against those who raided the concert.
Some of the Twitterati found parallels for the police raid in the Taliban intolerance for music in Afghanistan. Others, like Aimal Wali of the Awami National Party, said the ANP would raise the issue on the assembly floor to “find out who used the police as a Taliban force”.
The SHO police said the organisers were asked to report any loss or damage to property but instead, they took to the social media to bring it a bad name.
The Pishtakhara Islahi Committee, a local social welfare organisation, lauded the police raid, saying it was taken against song and dance on Shab-i-Barat.
Meanwhile, artists, rights activists and literati also took strong exception to the alleged harassment of noted Pashto folk singer Karan Khan during the musical concert. 
They urged the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government to take notice of the incident. Khadim Hussain, provincial secretary culture of Awami National Party, told this scribe the ‘attack’ on the musical concert was unjustified and termed it a raid on Pakhtun culture. He said his party would raise voice against this incident. 
“According to my information, local police officials were involved in the incident. Karan Khan is a respectable artist and raid on his live performance, breaking of musical instruments and denigrating wedding guests were in no way permissible in a Pakhtun society. The high-ups should take notice of this incident,” Mr Hussain said. 
Social activist Shafeeq Gigyani in a statement condemned the incident and also announced a protest in front of the Peshawar Press Club on Monday (today). 
“Police officials headed by the SHO raided the musical concert, beat up the musicians, broke their musical instruments and got away with a bag full of money,” Mr Gigyani alleged. 
When contacted, Hunari Tolana Welfare Society president Rashid Khan said the artist community condemned the raid against Karan Khan and his colleagues and asked KP authorities to ensure security of artists. 
“The incident has created a sense of insecurity among the artists,” he maintained. 
Tariq Pakhtunyar, a young poet, said that artists and musicians had been under threat in KP for the last several decades and no steps had been taken to ensure their security.

MUSTARD CROP: The growers on Sunday demanded of the government to purchase their mustard seed at reasonable price, so they are not forced to sell it at throwaway rates.
The harvest of the mustard crop, which is grown across the district, has started, the growers said while speaking at a meeting held on Sunday. 
The growers said the mustard oil-producing units wanted to purchase their seed at Rs6,500 per 50 kilogramme. However, they added the same oil producers purchased the seed from Punjab at Rs8,000 per 50kg.
“The oil producers are ready to pay in advance because there is great demand of mustard oil in the market as it is widely used in treatment of hair and other cures, but they offer very low price,” said Gul Nabi Khan, a farmer of Shahmansoor village.
There are several mustard oil-producing units in the Swabi district.
Jabeen Qamar, an agricultural expert, said research showed that mustard oil could help lower blood pressure and sugar levels in the body. “There are various other benefits of mustard oil,” he added.

2022-03-31,2022-03-21,Over 50pc independent female candidates contesting local govt polls in KP,ISLAMABAD: The independent women contestants outnumbered the combined tally of women candidates fielded by the...,"ISLAMABAD: The independent women contestants outnumbered the combined tally of women candidates fielded by the political parties for the Neighborhood and Village Councils in the second phase of local government elections being held in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) on March 31.
Overall, the independent female candidates constitute 51pc as against 27pc and 22pc women fielded by liberal and religious parties respectively.
This was revealed by Pattan, an NGO that works for democracy, human rights and gender equality in a report released here on Sunday.
It said reserved seats remained vacant or being won without any contest, a phenomenon that had also been seen in the first phase of the polls.
According to Pattan, lack of political will appears to be mainly responsible for low rate of female participation in local elections.
The second phase of local election shows that on an average only 1.76 female candidates are in the field against one seat, while seat to candidate ratio on other categories of seats is much high. For instance, on average there are 10 candidates against one seat for chairmen/mayor category.
Pattan argues that prior conditions (female literacy rate, human development level, women’s participation in labour force and access to public life, etc.,) appear to have played a major role in determining the level of women’s participation in the election.
Because of the existing differentiation, women’s participation as candidates varies from district to district. For instance, in Lower and Upper Kohistan – extremely poor and underdeveloped districts --about 90pc women seats remained vacant. 
In Battagram, out of total 90 female seats as many as 71 or 79pc remained vacant.
In South Waziristan too, more than 68pc of female seats remained vacant, while in Abbottabad, only 32 or 15pc of the 209 seats are vacant. 
In Upper Chitral, female candidates did not leave a single seat vacant.
However, there appears significant variations across districts. 
For instance, share of religious parties is higher than liberal parties in six districts - Mansehra 16pc, North Waziristan 36pc and Kurram 36pc, and Orakzai 32%. The liberal parties have clear edge over religious parties in eight districts - Upper Chitral 33pc, Lower Dir 49pc, Malakand 44pc, Shangla 43pc, Swat 50pc and Upper Dir 57pc. 
In 11 districts the independent candidates constitute clear majority in comparison to combined strength of all parties. 
In Abbottabad 88pc, Battagram 94pc, Upper Chitral 56pc, Lower Chitral 64pc, Mansehra 84pc, North Waziristan 53pc, South Waziristan 81pc, Orakzai 56pc, and Shangla 50pc.
Analysis of the contestation data (ECP Form X List of Contesting Candidates) also reveals some interesting socio-political trends:
1) High participation of female candidates even in the conservative or traditional districts than the combined female candidates of political parties is a clear sign of emergence of new social forces that are ready to play an important role in local governance.
2) Political parties appear to be ignorant of their emergence and have little appetite to broaden and deepen democracy and to avail this opportunity.
3) Political parties seem to be more interested in top positions i.e. mayors and chairpersons than in the quota seats of the marginalised sections of the society.
4) As a large number of women seats will remain vacant even after by-election female populations of many Neighborhood and Village Councils of KPK are likely to be deprived of women representatives.
Pattan’s analysis is primarily based on the ECP’s Form X (list of contesting candidates) of 17 districts.
The Pattan in it’s recommendations said the ECP should make available data and forms of every election promptly.
It said political parties need to invest resources to set up party chapters at grassroots level and must also hold internal party election and ECP should monitor their polling processes.
It also said civil society, women groups and trade unions should plan to field candidates against quota seats.

2022-03-21,2022-03-21,"Pakistan, Australia eye series win as Test cricket returns to Lahore after 13 years","”It’s a different feeling to play in front of a home crowd, at my home ground. I can’t explain this feeling,” says Babar Azam.","LAHORE: When Pakistan captain Babar Azam and his Australian counterpart Pat Cummins walk towards the Gaddafi Stadium centre for the toss of the three-match series decider on Monday, it will mark the first time in 13 years that the venue will be hosting a Test.
The last Test played here in 2009 was called off on the morning of the third day of Pakistan’s second Test against Sri Lanka after gunmen opened fire on the visiting team at the iconic Liberty Chowk, a stone’s throw from the prestigious venue.
The attack saw Pakistan’s exile from the sport as a host country with the national side playing its ‘home’ games in the United Arab Emirates.
None of Pakistan’s players in their current squad have played a Test match in Lahore, but for Babar, who only just started playing youth cricket back then, it will be a special moment, as he not only plays but also leads Pakistan in a Test in the city where he was born and grew up.
”It’s a different feeling to play in front of a home crowd, at my home ground. I can’t explain this feeling,” Babar, who made his Test debut in 2016, told reporters in an online press conference on Sunday.
The Pakistan skipper, however, didn’t seem like losing his element on what, undeniably, will be a momentous occasion. He wanted to make it more memorable by ensuring his team wins the match to take the series 1-0 after an unexciting draw in Rawalpindi and a thrilling one in Karachi.
“The main aim is the same; to win,” said the 27-year-old, whose 603-minute 196-run knock helped Pakistan save the Karachi Test to keep the series alive.
The playing surfaces in Rawalpindi and Karachi have been subjected to criticism for their lack of support to the bowlers with neither team managing to take 20 wickets.
The Lahore pitch — of which the preparation has been overseen by former International Cricket Council academy curator Toby Lumsden — is expected to assist batters as well, but Babar believed spinners will be able to extract turn from it and that a result will be a possibility unlike the first two Tests. 
“Though the pitch looks the same, I saw some little cracks which might open up from the third day and help the spinners to take advantage,” said the right-handed batter.
“I see a result here and if we win against a major team, it will mean a lot and will be a proud moment for us.”
Babar said he will have one final look at the pitch before the match to decide Pakistan’s final eleven. His Australian counterpart Cummins, on the other hand, will go with the same group that played in Karachi, expecting the pitch to behave in a similar way.
“It seems hard, but I don’t see it being too much different from the other ones [Rawalpindi and Karachi],” said the pacer. 
“We feel like we have our bases covered if needed, whether it is reverse swing or spin later in the game. 
“There are no injury worries, everyone is freshened up, so we are confident in the eleven.”
Australia could well have gone on to win the Karachi Test after giving Pakistan a mammoth 506 runs to win in the fourth innings had they held on to the chances their bowler’s created.
Abdullah Shafique, who went on to combine for more than 200 runs with Babar, was dropped while he was at 20 in the fourth day while Babar was dropped twice on the last day. Later, Usman Khawaja spilled Pakistan wicket-keeper/batter Mohammad Rizwan just before he reached his century.
With batters expected to dominate in the Lahore Test as well, Cummins said good fielding will pay dividends for both sides.
“Wickets are at a premium in this series so you cannot afford to drop too many chances,” he said. “So that is going to be the challenge this week.”

The day-night pink ball Test finished inside three days as India beat Sri Lanka by 238 runs to win the two-Test series 2-0. The pitch offered sharp turn and variable bounce from the first session as 16 wickets fell on day one.
“The pitch offered a lot of turn on the first day itself and though it improved with every session, in my view, it was not an even contest between bat and ball,” match referee Javagal Srinath said.
Demerit points remain active for a rolling five-year period and any venue which accumulates five of them for poor pitches or the outfield will be suspended from hosting international cricket for a period of 12 months. 
Bangalore is the second venue in as many weeks to receive the  “below average” reprimand, after the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium in neighbouring Pakistan.
At the Rawalpindi stadium, this month’s first Test between the hosts and Australia ended in a tame draw — with 1,187 runs scored for the loss of only 14 wickets.
