Nazar Muhammad Baloch also presented the Balochistan Ombudsman\u2019s Annual Report for the year 2021 to the President.Talking to the ombudsman, the president emphasised the need for expanding the outreach of ombudsmen to far-flung areas to provide justice to the people at their doorsteps.\nHe said the provincial ombudsman should continue to ensure the implementation of his findings by the agencies concerned to maintain public trust in his office. \nPublished in The Express Tribune, April 5th, 2023.\n", "1": "Punjab Small Dams Organisation has approved the construction of the Mohra Shera Dam to address the water needs of\u00a0 Rawalpindi.\nAccording to sources, the approved dam will be completed at an estimated cost of Rs281.95 million.\nThey said that once completed, the project is expected to irrigate 5,000 acres of land and provide clean drinking water to over 0.2 million residents of nearby areas.\nMeanwhile, the Punjab Small Dam Organisation has announced that the construction of the said dam will be completed in just 18 months. The organisation has already called for tenders from major dam construction companies on April 24, and the contract is expected to be awarded in the first week of the following month. In addition to providing much-needed water for usage, the new dam will also feature a state-of-the-art park where visitors could enjoy motor boats and paddle boats.

The IWMB chairperson emphasised that the leopards were least interested in humans and were not a threat in the protected area but rather indicated a healthy ecosystem.\nShe urged the public to avoid disturbing the wildlife in the national park as it is their habitat and humans are intruding into it. \"Visitors, hikers, and trekkers are requested to remain careful and avoid visiting the national park half an hour before sunset.\nBecause it is the patrolling time of the wildcat and can result in any incident, she said and added that though it has never happened, precaution is a must. \u201cIn case of any encounter with a leopard or any wild animal one must abstain from confronting or chasing that animal and never shout as it will scare the animal,\" she added. The IWMB has also issued detailed guidelines for MHNP visitors to keep themselves safe from wild animals, especially leopards.\nThe guidelines for locals, tourists, trekkers, and area guides underlined that the local community should avoid entering the forest area during early morning or evening hours as leopards remain active during this time.\nThe guidelines further stated that residents should turn lights on at night, keep livestock indoors, and accompany them while grazing in the woods.\n\u201cWomen and children should not be allowed to enter the jungle alone and they must go in groups to collect fuelwood. However, women are also advised to avoid going into jungle for collecting fuelwood during their periods, the statement read.\n\u201cIndividuals in the forest should talk loudly, and in the case of a group, one group member should guard the surrounding.\u201d\nIWMB also urged that individuals entering the forests should keep a club with them and keep on talking in a loud voice, especially in the evening and morning hours. In case of any encounter with a leopard in the wild, it is important for the individual to remain composed and patient instead of shouting and running in fear as this reaction will be similar to that of the leopard\u2019s prey, the guideline noted.\n\u201cOne should rather step back and leave the area slowly. If an individual hears the growling sounds of a leopard then he or she must avoid intruding further into the jungle area.\u201d\nFurthermore, if a female leopard is spotted with her cubs, the guidelines said, it is necessary to avoid entering or passing into that area.\n\u201cIn case of a very close encounter with the leopard, one should clap and should move both arms or shawl to show him or herself bigger than the wildcat.\u201d\nPublished in The Express Tribune, April 5th, 2023.\n", "3": "The Rawalpindi Cantonment Board (RCB) has implemented a new sanitation plan under the \u2018Cantt Clean\u2019 slogan for the residential areas and business centres of the cantonment.\nThe transfer of solid waste from the transfer station to the dumping site has been outsourced. The transfer of solid waste from the six-kilometre area of the cantonment to the solid waste transfer station has become the responsibility of the RCB\u2019s sanitation department.\nMechanical sweepers will clean the streets of the cantonment while iron containers worth Rs20 million have been provided at the solid waste collection points.

Everything essential like milk, oil, and yoghurt is slowly becoming out of reach.\u201d Malik further said that retailers were charging whatever rates they wished for as the district administration was yet to wake up from its slumber.\nWhile Malik held the district administration responsible for failing to take action against profiteers, Sharjeel, a resident of the city, told the Express Tribune that the incumbent government was to blame. \u201cEver since this government has come to power, everything from electricity to fuel has become costly,\u201d criticised Sharjeel.\nAnother resident, Raheel, concurring with Sharjeel, was of the view that he could not even imagine how tough life was for the unemployed and daily wage labourers, if the salaried class was struggling as much as it is. \u201cSomeone needs to wake up to the plight of the people and improve the economic situation,\u201d he implored.\nWhen asked about the absence of price control committees, which was adding to the plight of the populace of the federal capital, a Spokesperson of the Islamabad Capital Territory Administration, replied that high inflation levels were a reality that the Administration was working to address. \u201cWe are working on making price control committees more functional to put an end to profiteering,\u201d the Spokesperson told The Express Tribune.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, April 5th, 2023.\n", "5": "Australia will provide life-saving nutrition support to the Pakistan flood response through an additional AUD $5 million in immediate humanitarian assistance.\nThe 2022 flooding left an estimated 1.6 million severely malnourished children needing lifesaving nutrition services across the 84 flood affected districts.

However, several female students were not allowed to enter the examination room as they had no roll number slips because they had been withheld by the principal of the school.\nSSC-II student Rida Arshad, who was barred by school Principal Madam Rehana from appearing in the examination, earlier told The Express Tribune that she hailed from a low-income household and he father barely pays her fee by working as a taxi driver.\nShe said that when she went to the school to pick up her roll number slip, the principal rudely told her that she was not capable to sit in the exam. The school principal shoved her away.\nShe had said that she could not appear in the English paper since the principal refused to release her the roll number slip that the Rawalpindi board had issued.\nShe had alleged that the roll number slips of several girls had been withheld by the principal, only allowing so-called intelligent girls to appear in the exam to get better results and positions in the examination.\nEarlier, Rawalpindi Education Authority CEO Dr Qazi Tariq had said that an inquiry would be initiated against the principal as no such instructions had been issued by him.\nWhen approached by the phone to get his version for not initiating an inquiry into the episode, he dropped the call saying that he was busy in a meeting.\nSeveral questions were sent to him via WhatsApp and he said that the CEO office did not issue instructions to any school in the district to hold back the roll number slips of slow learners.\nHe said that he always emphasised in meetings with principals that quality education should be provided to the children and results will automatically improve.\nDr Tariq did not respond to the question for not initiating the investigation into the matter as several students had been barred from appearing in the English paper of class 10th.\nMeanwhile, the students, who were barred from appearing in the English paper, demanded of the Punjab education minister and the chief minister to take notice of the issue and issue instructions to the BISE authorities to allow the students to appear in the English paper.\nRida Rashid said that after the news was published in The Express Tribune, her school principal handed over the roll number slips to all the students.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, April 5th, 2023.\n", "8": "The century-old tradition of sending Eid cards to loved ones living in distant cities and across the seas to share in the joy of Eid has completely died out.\nThe tradition of sending Eid cards has now been replaced with social media applications including WhatsApp, TikTok, Facebook and Instagram which enable people to send greetings to their loved ones at home and abroad in the blink of an eye.\nThe act of sending an Eid card was a beautiful way to share the joy of Eid with one\u2019s loved ones in the past. Whole families eagerly waited to receive Eid cards from their loved ones living abroad.\nLooking under the layers of these sealed Eid cards, when a note of five or 10 rupees came out, the joy of Eid would get doubled and the family would burst with joy.\nEid card shopping was also an art. Children used to buy special Eid cards for their parents, wives for their husbands living abroad, sisters for their brothers and couples for their better halves.\nIslamic, cultural, humorous, loving, sad and funny Eid card designs were plentiful. It was the peak of the film industry. Eid cards with decorated pictures of actors, artists and sports stars were also in abundance. There were also huge-size Eid cards.\nThe postman, who delivered Eid cards from door to door, also brought and distributed these cards with great preparation. People had to pay Rs10 \u2018Eidi\u2019 to the postman for delivering the Eid card.\nAs soon as Ramazan began, Eid cards selling stalls were set up in all the markets, where women, men and children used to buy the cards of their choice which were quite costly.\nThe Eid card sale was regularly called a business season. Every family used to buy five to seven Eid cards on average and would post them to their loved ones.\nSpecial shops would decorate Eid cards. Even now, shops have some Eid cards for sale, but now there is no buyer for them.\nEarlier, the printing press used to take one month to design and print these cards in various decorative designs. A large number of Eid cards filled with love for the Pakistan Army were also sold, while government officers, private companies, doctors, and lawyers used to send specially printed professional Eid cards.\nEid card making and selling had become a small industry, which has now been eliminated by the advancement of technology.\nThe new generation is not familiar with the Eid card culture. Earlier, families used to keep the best Eid cards as decorations in their sitting and drawing rooms.\nIrshad Hasan said that in every Ramazan, the purchasing of Eid cards like Eid clothes was done with full preparation and they used to post Eid cards with great preparation.\nPost offices across the country used to issue a regular schedule of Eid card delivery bookings, which was usually from the 18th to the 24th of Ramazan, during which there was a rush of Eid card senders in every post office. The Eid cards that were booked after that were delivered after the Eid holidays.\nEveryone used to buy and post their favourite Eid cards. The big companies would also print Eid cards for their publicity and provide them to their employees. All of this has not become a beautiful memory.\nToday's generation is limited to sending Eid greetings via WhatsApp, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook instead of by Eid cards. The present generation has started fulfilling the ritual of sending Eid greetings by forwarding the messages that are shared in social media groups.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, April 5th, 2023.\n"}, "Link": {"0": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2409964/alvi-for-expeditiously-addressing-public-complaints", "1": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2409967/construction-of-mohra-shera-dam-approved", "2": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2409969/citizens-cautioned-after-leopard-spotted-on-trail-5", "3": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2409971/new-sanitation-strategy-thrashed-out-for-cantt", "4": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2409974/price-control-committees-absent-as-inflation-wreaks-havoc", "5": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2409977/australia-announces-aud-5m-for-emergency-nutrition", "6": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2409980/robber-killed-in-alleged-police-encounter-1", "7": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2409981/weak-students-allowed-to-sit-exams", "8": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2409982/eid-cards-a-beautiful-fading-into-oblivion"}, "Category": {"0": "islamabad", "1": "islamabad", "2": "islamabad", "3": "islamabad", "4": "islamabad", "5": "islamabad", "6": "islamabad", "7": "islamabad", "8": "islamabad"}, "CreationDate": {"0": "2023-04-05", "1": "2023-04-05", "2": "2023-04-05", "3": "2023-04-05", "4": "2023-04-05", "5": "2023-04-05", "6": "2023-04-05", "7": "2023-04-05", "8": "2023-04-05"}, "Pic_url": {"0": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Alvi1673519486-0/Alvi1673519486-0.jpg", "1": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Mangla-dam1663476281-0/Mangla-dam1663476281-0.jpg", "2": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1038970-Snowleopardx-1454480249/1038970-Snowleopardx-1454480249.jpg", "3": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/rawalpindi1/rawalpindi1.jpg", "4": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/2202139-grocery-1587360724/2202139-grocery-1587360724.jpg", "5": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Feature-Image1672079093-10/Feature-Image1672079093-10.jpg", "6": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1565218-crime-1511334654/1565218-crime-1511334654.jpg", "7": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Examinations1635515262-0/Examinations1635515262-0.jpg", "8": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/51680642203-0/51680642203-0.jpg"}}
