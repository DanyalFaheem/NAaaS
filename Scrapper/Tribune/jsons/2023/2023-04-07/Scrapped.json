The location was chosen following a careful evaluation of suggestions forwarded by the Capital Development Authority at the committee meeting chaired by convener Mian Raza Rabbani.\nThe participants were of the view that the monument would serve as a symbol of Pakistan's commitment to democracy and its adherence to the principles enshrined in the constitution. It was expected to become a landmark of the capital city and a source of inspiration for generations to come.\nRaza Rabbani expressed his satisfaction with the progress made by the committee. He said: \"The constitution monument is a significant project that will showcase Pakistan's achievements and its commitment to democracy.

The cleaning must begin in May but the government is still going slow on the fund issue, they added.\n\u201cThe pre-monsoon season is going to start after 1.5 months, and at least 2.5 months are required for cleaning the drains.\u201d\nWASA sources say that the price of diesel has increased significantly following which the private sector has also increased its rates.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, April 7th, 2023.\n", "2": "The Ambassador of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to Pakistan, Hamad Obaid Ibrahim Al Zabi and Senate Chairman Muhammad Sadiq Sanjrani held a meeting at the Parliament House to discuss bilateral relations and foster greater cooperation between the two nations. \nThey discussed the deep fraternal relations between Pakistan and the UAE bound by common values and culture for over 50 years. \n\u00a0\nPublished in The Express Tribune, April 7th, 2023.\n", "3": "The Lahore High Court Rawalpindi bench judge Justice Mirza Waqas Rauf on Thursday barred the Capital Development Authority (CDA) from acquiring 1,200-kanal of land on Chak Belli Road at Losar in the suburb of Rawalpindi for dumping capital\u2019s waste.\nThe court issued the directives on petitions challenging the Rawalpindi administration\u2019s notification, allowing the CDA to acquire the land and dump the capital\u2019s waste at Losar.\nEarlier, the CDA had to postpone the public hearing seeking objections regarding the dumping of the capital\u2019s waste at Losar after the Punjab Environment Protection Department objected to the hurriedly called public debate.\nTwo weeks back, the Rawalpindi administration allocated 1,200-kanal of land to the CDA in Mauza Losar to dump the capital\u2019s waste in violation of the court order. Rawalpindi Deputy Commissioner Hasan Waqar Cheema through a notification had given formal permission to the CDA to dump all garbage and harmful hospital waste from Islamabad at the Losar dumping site.\nThe high court accepted six petitions filed in this regard for hearing and issued notices to the CDA chairman, the Islamabad chief commissioner, the Rawalpindi commissioner and deputy commissioner and the Punjab government seeking their replies on April 10.\nThe court also summoned the head of the Rawalpindi Solid Waste Management Company at the next hearing. The petitions have been filed by three brick kiln owners and four citizens of the neighbourhood.\nIn the petitions, brick kiln owners Irfan and locals have taken the plea that there was already a waste dumping ground spread over 1,200-kanal at Losar to dump Rawalpindi\u2019s waste. They said that the high court had ordered the removal of the existing dumping site.\nThe petitioners said that on the court order, the Rawalpindi Solid Waste Management Company decided to move the dumping site to Mandira Road and the process of acquiring 1,400-kanal was also started. \nThey said that instead of removing the existing dumping site, the Rawalpindi administration has allowd the CDA to acquire 1,200-kanal to dump the capital\u2019s waste.\nThe petitioners said that Islamabad is a separate district and it has plenty of unused land where it can dump the waste. \nThey argued that garbage from another district cannot be allowed to be dumped in Rawalpindi.\nThey said that the existing dumping ground has already been declared illegal by the court, issuing an order to shift it to Mandira Road.\nThey said that the construction of dumping grounds on 2,400-kanal for both Rawalpindi and Islamabad will further increase infectious diseases including throat, ear, stomach and eye ailments in the entire area.\nThey said that the process of constructing a new dumping ground should be declared illegal and according to the court decision, the existing dumping ground of Rawalpindi should also be ordered to be shifted immediately.\nThe petitioners said that about 14 brick kilns will be affected if the dumping site was allowed to be constructed and the closure of these kilns will increase unemployment.\nThe LHC\u2019s Rawalpindi bench had ordered to remove the dumping site, where waste from Rawalpindi is already being dumped, to Mandra\u2013Chakwal Road, where the Rawalpindi administration had acquired 1,200-kanal of land.\nInstead of moving the waste dumping site to Mandra\u2013Chakwal Road, the admin has not only allowed the CDA to dispose of waste at Losar but also decided to dump the waste of the garrison city at the same location.\nThe PTI government had approved removing the dumping ground spreading on 1,250-kanal at Losar and moving it to Mandra\u2013Chakwal Road. However, the current Rawalpindi administration decided against the order of the high court and allowed the CDA to dump the capital\u2019s waste at the current dumping site.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, April 7th, 2023.\n", "4": "Quaid-e-Azam University Vice-Chancellor Dr Niaz Ahmad Akhtar has vowed to introduce practices of good governance by enabling statutory bodies to conduct regular meetings and make decisions without interruption.\nIn an interview with APP on Thursday, he highlighted the university's progress on multiple fronts, ranging from new initiatives to governance.\nHe also emphasised the importance of good governance and novel initiatives as the university's priority.\nAccording to Dr Niaz, the proper functioning of these bodies will build trust among stakeholders and help the institution achieve its objectives effectively.\nWithin three weeks after Dr Niaz Ahmed joined the university, a meeting of the finance and planning committee, selection board and syndicate have taken place.\nDr Niaz Ahmad is a distinguished scholar and academician with a PhD in chemical engineering from the University of Leeds, UK.

of the Divisional Emergency Response Committee chaired by Rawalpindi Commissioner Liaquat Ali Chattha, Chief Executive Officer Health Dr Ansar Ishaq told those in attendance that 291,739 hotspots were

surveillance, out of which 1,137 houses came out positive and required action was taken,\u201d he said.\nThe Rawalpindi commissioner said that two confirmed cases of dengue have been reported in the district so far, but we have to control it from the beginning.\nHe directed that all the departments should pay full attention to larva elimination as the current weather is extremely suitable for its breeding. \u201cIf it is not controlled now, it will be impossible to control the adult mosquito,\u201d he said.\nThe commissioner strictly directed that there was no room for any kind of carelessness or misrepresentation in the measures taken to eliminate the dengue mosquitoes.\nHe directed that immediate arrangements should be made for the disposal of solid waste. \u201cAll vacant plots in the city have been identified and the owners of these plots have been served notices by the deputy commissioner,\u201d he said and added that in case of non-compliance, such plots will be

attention should be given to the field activities and drainage arrangements should be made immediately.\n\u201cApart from this, attention should be paid to the surveillance of the cemeteries and parks where there are weeds and there is a risk of water accumulation,\u201d he said.\nChattha directed that teams appointed for dengue surveillance should try to control the growth of dengue larvae by
