have complained about the exorbitant rates amid unprecedented inflation.\nAlthough the district administration has established several Sasta Ramzan bazaars and Fair Price shops in the city and Cantt areas to ensure the supply of essential items including vegetables, gram flour, dates, fruit, and chicken at affordable prices during the fasting month, people said the relief was insignificant given the scale of current inflation.\nCitizens said this Ramazan is like no other as they are finding it increasingly hard to put food on the table for iftar and sehri.\nThey dubbed the discount offered to them at these bazaars a joke and said a meager Rs30 to Rs40 difference in comparison with the open market is a farce, to say the least.\nPeople visiting the market to buy fruit for Iftar on the first day of the holy month returned empty-handed as apples were available at Rs450 per kg, guavas at Rs300 per kg, melon at Rs200 per kg, bananas at Rs300 per dozen and dates at Rs500 to Rs700 per kg.\nA citizen said that the administration failed to curb the hike in food prices a week before Ramazan and the new prices of essential commodities were implemented to rob the people.\nCitizens Mohammad Ramzan, Bashir Ahmed, Gulshan Malik, and Yasir Shabbir said that the rates of various items are reduced for those observing the holy month all over the world but in our country, Ramazan is considered an occasion to gain maximum profit, they said.\nThey further said the inflation is so high that they can\u2019t even buy the basic food items for Iftar.\nThe citizens said that the authorities concerned have failed to enforce official prices, due to which those who earn profit by creating artificial inflation keep fleecing the people.\nBefore the advent of the fasting month, the Rawalpindi district administration had fixed new prices of essential commodities besides making 16 Ramazan Sasta Bazaars, 34 Fair Price Shops, and 8 Sasta Saheri Bazaars functional to help mitigate the impacts of high inflation on the low-income strata.\nSources in the administration said that 10 Ramazan Sasta Bazaars have been set up in the Cantonment areas and one each in Murree, Kotli Sattian, Kallar Syedan, Kahutta, Gujar Khan, and Taxila.\n\u00a0\nPublished in The Express Tribune, March 24th, 2023.\n", "1": "Federal Minister for Climate Change Senator Sherry Rehman on Thursday slammed Imran for

On contacting the gas utility company\u2019s helpline, the citizens were told that gas will be supplied from 2:30 am to 6:00 am and from 4:00 pm to 9:00 pm. But the gas pressure remained very low even during the Sehri timing.\nThe government had issued orders to ensure the uninterrupted supply of gas to domestic consumers during Ramazan, but complaints of low gas pressure were reported in several areas of the twin cities on the first day of the holy month.\nThese areas include private housing societies around Block-C, Block-D, Satellite Town, Sadiqabad, Imam Bara, Chaklala Scheme-1 and 3, Range Road and GT Road.\nQaiser Nadeem, a citizen, told The Express Tribune that when he called the gas company\u2019s helpline to complain about the absence of gas supply and low pressure in the area, he was told that the gas supply timings were from 2:30 am to 6:00 am and 4:00 pm to 9:00 pm.\nHe said the government had announced that the uninterrupted supply of gas would continue during Ramazan. \u201cNow the situation is that due to the absence of gas supply, several households with children and patients etc are facing severe difficulties in cooking food,\u201d he lamented and added that even the gas pressure was very low at the time of sehri.\nAnother citizen Waqas, a resident of Block-C, Satellite Town, also expressed serious concerns over low gas pressure and demanded the government ensure proper gas supply so that people do not face any problems during the holy month.\nOn the other hand, the general manager of Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited was contacted to get his comment but he did not attend the call.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, March 24th, 2023.\n"}, "Link": {"0": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2407789/overpricing-in-ramzan-bazaars-irks-citizens", "1": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2407796/pti-flayed-for-engaging-us-pr-firm", "2": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2407799/mou-signed-to-promote-higher-education", "3": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2407805/imrans-focal-person-sent-on-judicial-remand", "4": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2407807/nadra-launches-next-generation-mobile-app", "5": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2407803/man-held-for-torturing-stepdaughter", "6": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2407801/qau-to-start-on-campus-classes", "7": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2407792/low-gas-pressure-adds-to-peoples-woes"}, "Category": {"0": "islamabad", "1": "islamabad", "2": "islamabad", "3": "islamabad", "4": "islamabad", "5": "islamabad", "6": "islamabad", "7": "islamabad"}, "CreationDate": {"0": "2023-03-24", "1": "2023-03-24", "2": "2023-03-24", "3": "2023-03-24", "4": "2023-03-24", "5": "2023-03-24", "6": "2023-03-24", "7": "2023-03-24"}, "Pic_url": {"0": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/900465-ramzanbazar-1433837532/900465-ramzanbazar-1433837532.JPG", "1": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Collage-11658592108-0/Collage-11658592108-0.jpg", "2": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1097198-nustx-1462343444/1097198-nustx-1462343444.jpg", "3": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/HassaanNiazi_FB1676993288-0/HassaanNiazi_FB1676993288-0.jpg", "4": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/57613-nadrasharejpg-1506430341/57613-nadrasharejpg-1506430341.jpg", "5": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/woman---faith-healer1615351957-0/woman---faith-healer1615351957-0.jpg", "6": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1279781-QuaidiAzam_University_Entrancex-1483137460/1279781-QuaidiAzam_University_Entrancex-1483137460.JPG", "7": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/gas-leak1668620328-0/gas-leak1668620328-0.jpg"}}
