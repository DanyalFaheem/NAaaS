The Sasta Ramazan Bazaar which was established in the heart of the city at Committee Chowk was officially closed due to high inflation and a very low turnout of customers.\nThe administration has removed all the tents, tables, chairs and canopies from the bazaar and the security staff has also been withdrawn. The entire area of the bazaar has been turned into a junkyard, a parking area of the adjoining car workshops.\nThe stalls selling mutton, beef, chicken, cheap flour and sugar have also been removed while only the usual carts of vegetable and fruit vendors have remained.\nThe Committee Chowk is the centre of Rawalpindi. It has a large population of about 500,000 people around it and is touched on all four sides by the densest 12 union councils. Due to its vast empty area, this place was selected for the cheap Friday market and then the cheap Sunday market 40 years ago in 1983.\n", "1": "The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Anti-Human Trafficking Cell has apprehended two suspects on charges of extorting money from gullible people on the pretext of sending them abroad.\nFIA Anti-Human Trafficking Cell Islamabad headed by Deputy Director Amina Baig arrested an accused, Adnan Sulaiman, from Rawat who was allegedly involved in human trafficking.\nThe accused extorted Rs5.2 million from three citizens to send them abroad for employment.

He said that another major reason for the increase in illegal kidney transplants was the spike in the number of human kidney failures over the past years.\n\u201cThe kidney failure cases are continuously rising due to diabetes, blood pressure and unhealthy lifestyle among the citizens,\u201d he said adding that three major rackets have been busted in Rawalpindi during the last three3 months. He said that unfortunately, doctors, surgeons and other educated people have also been found involved in the heinous crime and have been arrested.\nHe said that the investigation has revealed that most kidney recipients were foreigners, especially from Gulf countries. He said that kidney transplantation in Gulf and Arab states is a very complicated process.\n\u201cKidney patients find people in Rawalpindi who sell their kidney for up to Rs0.3 million but the racket further sells it to the donor for Rs10 to Rs11 million. Those involved in illegal kidney transplants in Rawalpindi said that they receive up to Rs11 million from foreign patients/recipients and up to Rs4 million from local patients, who look for kidneys,\u201d he said.\nHe said that operations were conducted in Rawat, Morgah and Taxila in collaboration with Rawalpindi police. He said that the investigation of recent cases revealed that all those who sold their kidneys for money hailed from very poor families and they were paid up to Rs0.2 million by the rackets for one kidney. He said investigations also revealed that individuals who sell kidneys to these rackets also become their agents for \u2018commission\u2019. He said that these agents help the rackets find financiallycrippled people intending to sell their kidneys. He said that those involved in the network mostly target brick kiln workers.\nHasan Akhtar said that the police were being apprised of the PHOTA act to register cases against people involved in the illegal transplantation of kidneys. He said that there was a need to raise awareness among people about illegal transplantation of human organs. Through an awareness campaign, he said, the public could be educated that kidneys could be donated legally to loved ones. \u201cIf a kidney transplant is done legally, it costs a maximum of Rs2 million,\u201d he said.\nHe said that keeping the increasing number of kidney failure, the PHOTA act has been amended and now not only blood relatives can donate kidneys to patients, but also extended family can donate kidneys. Apart from this, he said people who do not get donors can avail of the facility of \u2018donor swap\u2019. Under this facility, if two donors whose tissues do not match with the intended patient but have a tissue match with another patient, such individuals can swap organs and donate.\n"}, "Link": {"0": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2408973/ramazan-bazaars-fail-to-attract-customers", "1": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2408971/two-alleged-human-traffickers-held", "2": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2408969/videos-of-ambush-killing-surface", "3": "https://tribune.com.pk/story/2408968/plan-afoot-to-curb-illegal-organ-trade"}, "Category": {"0": "islamabad", "1": "islamabad", "2": "islamabad", "3": "islamabad"}, "CreationDate": {"0": "2023-03-30", "1": "2023-03-30", "2": "2023-03-30", "3": "2023-03-30"}, "Pic_url": {"0": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/907165-RamazanBazaars-1434820931/907165-RamazanBazaars-1434820931.JPG", "1": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1080660-arrrestcriminalcopy-1460049920/1080660-arrrestcriminalcopy-1460049920.JPG", "2": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1491966-gunshot-1503812649/1491966-gunshot-1503812649.jpg", "3": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/1226035-KIDNEY-1478728540/1226035-KIDNEY-1478728540.jpg"}}
