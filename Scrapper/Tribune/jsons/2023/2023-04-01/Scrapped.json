Following the abrupt closure, no subsidy on vegetables, pulses, fruits, rice, ghee, and sugar will be given to citizens.\nAccording to the district administration, only Utility Stores will provide subsidies during the holy month.

Rawalpindi Deputy Commissioner Hasan Waqar Cheema through a notification had given formal permission to the CDA to dump all garbage and harmful hospital waste from Islamabad at the Losar dumping site.\nAs the hearing commenced on Friday at F-9 Park in Islamabad, the Punjab Environment Protection Department opposed the CDA's request for the issuance of the no-objection certificate for the project objecting that the public hearing had been called hastily which was against section 9(3) of the environmental regulation. It sad that no public hearing could be held so hastily and prematurely for a mega project.\nThe Punjab Environment Protection Department also raised the objection the public hearing location (F-9 Park) was 50 kilometres away from the project site and the local residents were unable to travel that far. It said that this remote location for the public hearing from the landfill site was also a violation of the regulation and hence a notification was issued to cancel the public hearing.\nLocal residents have already announced to move the court with a contempt petition stating that the Rawalpindi administration has allowed the CDA to dump the waste at Losar in violation of the court order.\nThey said that instead of moving the waste dumping site to Mandra\u2013Chakwal Road, the Rawalpindi administration has not only allowed the CDA to dispose of waste at Losar but also decided to dump the waste of the garrison city at the same location.\nThe Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government had approved removing the dumping ground spreading on 1,250-kanal at Losar and moving it to Mandra\u2013Chakwal Road. However, the current Rawalpindi administration decided against the order of the high court and allowed the CDA to dump the capital\u2019s waste at the current dumping site.\nAfter the local administration allowed the CDA to dump the waste at Losar, around 120,000 residents of the area announced to file a contempt plea in the high court against the Rawalpindi deputy commissioner.\nThey announced to challenge the deputy commissioner\u2019s notification allowing the CDA to dump the capita\u2019s waste. Thoba, Bada Meera, Chhota Meera, Hari, Bhambli Meera and other villages are also located in the area.\nThe locals said that due to the dumping of garbage at Losar, citizens were already suffering from cancer, skin diseases, tuberculosis, and throat, stomach, and eye irritation.\nThey said that the dumping of the capital\u2019s waste will further exacerbate ailments and put the locals at higher risk of catching diseases.\nThey said that the construction of the new dumping ground for Islamabad will also lead to the shutting down of 15 brick kilns in Losar and nearby villages. Zigzag technology had been installed in these brick kilns at a cost of millions of rupees a year ago. The closure of these brick kilns will increase the prices of bricks and render thousands of workers jobless.\nMohammad Asif advocate and Imran Aziz said that on their earlier petition, the high court had decided to remove the dumping ground from Losar and shift it to Mandra Road. They said that Islamabad is a separate district, so how can the garbage of the federal capital be dumped in Punjab?\nThey said that the deputy commissioner has illegally allowed the garbage of Islamabad to be dumped in Rawalpindi. They said that they have decided to challenge the decision in the high court.\nThe locals said that Islamabad is a separate district and it has a sizable land where it can select a site for dumping waste and a landfill site. They said that they will not allow the construction of the landfill site in Rawalpindi for dumping Islamabad\u2019s waste.\n\u00a0According to Mohammad Asif advocate, the Rawalpindi commissioner has given the go-ahead for the development of a new landfill on Mandira Chakwal Road per the court ruling. He said that the dumping site at Losar should also be shifted there immediately.\nMeanwhile, locals also held a grand jirga and they unanimously vowed that no truck or vehicle would be permitted to dump garbage at Losar after Eid-ul-Fitr.\nMeanwhile, the CDA has decided to contact the Punjab caretaker government to set a new date for the public hearing for obtaining the NOC after it failed to swiftly obtain the NOC declaring the project environmental-friendly.\nEarlier, the Lahore High Court Rawalpindi bench ruled that the garbage dumping site at Losar, which covers 1,250-kanal, was illegal and unlawful.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, April 1st, 2023.\n", "5": "President Dr Arif Alvi directed an insurance company to grant the death insurance claim to the widow of a deceased policyholder whose claim was previously denied on the basis that the policyholder did not intentionally disclose his true health condition to the company when obtaining the policy.\nThe president gave this decision while accepting a representation filed by the complainant Shehnaz Akhtar against the order of the Federal Insurance Ombudsman (FIO) whereby the case had been closed.\nThe case was disposed of on the ground that the widow had already been refunded the premiums amounting to Rs150,000 deducted from her late husband\u2019s account and since the matter had been settled on compassionate grounds, thus, the company was not liable to pay the death insurance claim. Feeling aggrieved by the decision of FIO, the complainant filed a representation with the president, which he accepted.\nIn his decision, the president observed that the company repudiated the claim based on the death certificate alleging that it reflected that the deceased had been suffering from Diabetes Mellitus and Chronic Liver Disease since a year before death but no such period had been specified in the certificate.\nHe further noted that the insurance company was relying on an admission chart issued by a hospital in Lahore which pertained to the year 2017 whereas the policy had been issued in the year 2015, thus, it did not pertain to the insurance period.\nHe also referred to a decision of the Lahore High Court in the year 2009, wherein it had been held that the majority of people having ailments such as hypertension and diabetes lived either for decades or longer than people not having such diseases by remaining more careful in their lifetime, and the concealment of such diseases could not be termed as done fraudulently.\nThe president held that the insurance company was not justified in repudiating the insurance claim on such flimsy grounds. He said that maladministration on the part of the insurance company had been established, therefore, the orders of the FIO were being set aside. He further directed the company to pay the insurance claim to the complainant within 30 days of the receipt of the president\u2019s order. \n\u00a0\nPublished in The Express Tribune, April 1st, 2023.\n", "6": "The National Database & Registration Authority (NADRA) launches a dedicated helpline in a bid to enhance registration and maximise facilitation for the transgender community.\nThe day was celebrated as \u2018Transgender Day of Visibility\u2019 in the presence of transgender attendants. The helpline along with several other initiatives was inaugurated by Chairman NADRA, Tariq Malik.\nIn this regard, sensitisation trainings for NADRA personnel were also conducted by Regional Head Offices (RHOs) across the country to strengthen their abilities for providing information and support on obtaining identity documents to members of the transgender community.\nChairman NADRA, while expressing his views on the occasion, said that the most unique feature of the dedicated helpline is the deployment of transgender employees of NADRA to answer the calls.
