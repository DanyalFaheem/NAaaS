The lists include names of officials and workers of various wings of the party as well as former MNAs and MPAs, he said.\n\u201cThe police have been asked to trace and round up PTI workers.\u201d\nHe said in a late-night crackdown, the police took Hafiz Zahid Khan into custody and transferred him to Newtown police station.\nSimilarly, a police team led by Westridge Police Station SHO Inspector Zahid Zahoor raided the houses of Umar Tanveer Butt and PTI local leader Malik Imran but failed to arrest them.\n\u00a0\nPublished in The Express Tribune, March 22nd, 2023.\n", "2": "The Rawalpindi administration has allocated 1200-kanal of land to the Capital Development Authority (CDA) in Mauza Losar to dump the capital\u2019s waste in violation of the court order.\nRawalpindi Deputy Commissioner Hasan Waqar Cheema through a notification has given formal permission to the CDA to dump all garbage and harmful hospital waste from Islamabad at the Losar, dumping site.\nThe Lahore High Court Rawalpindi bench had ordered to remove the dumping site, where waste from Rawalpindi is already being dumped, to Mandra\u2013Chakwal Road, where the Rawalpindi administration had acquired 1,200-kanal of land.\nInstead of moving the waste dumping site to Mandra\u2013Chakwal Road, the Rawalpindi administration has not only allowed the CDA to dispose of waste at Losar but also decided to dump the waste of the garrison city at the same location.\nThe Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government had approved to remove the dumping ground spreading on 1,250-kanal at Losar and move it to Mandra\u2013Chakwal Road. However, the current Rawalpindi administration decided against the order of the high court and allowed the CDA to dump the capital\u2019s waste at the current dumping site.\nAfter the local administration allowed the CDA to dump the waste at Losar, around 120,000 residents of the area announced to file a contempt plea in the high court against the Rawalpindi deputy commissioner.\nThey announced to challenge the deputy commissioner\u2019s notification allowing the CDA to dump the capita\u2019s waste. Thoba, Bada Meera, Chhota Meera, Hari, Bhambli Meera and other villages are also located in the area.\nDue to the dumping of garbage at Losar, citizens were already suffering from cancer, skin diseases, tuberculosis, and throat, stomach, and eye irritation.\nThey said that the dumping of the capital\u2019s waste will further exacerbate ailments and put the locals at higher risk of catching diseases.\nThe construction of the new dumping ground for Islamabad will also lead to the shutting down of 15 brick kilns in Losar and nearby villages. Zigzag technology had been installed in these brick kilns at a cost of millions of rupees a year ago. The closure of these brick kilns will increase the prices of bricks and render thousands of workers jobless.\nMohammad Asif advocate and Imran Aziz said that on their petition, the high court had decided to remove the dumping ground from Losar and shift it to Mandra Road. They said that Islamabad is a separate district, so how can the garbage of the federal capital be dumped in Punjab?\nThey said that the deputy commissioner has illegally allowed the garbage of Islamabad to be dumped in Rawalpindi.

The WHO has indicated that Pakistan is in 23rd place among those countries which will have a severe shortage of water in the next decade.\nAccording to the WHO, the countries in which there is a severe shortage of water include Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Arab Emirates, Palestine, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Oman, Kyrgyzstan and Iran.\nIn the awareness campaign regarding the lack of water reservoirs in these countries, citizens and responsible institutions are being convinced about the economical use of water, its importance and utility and preventing wastage.\nLike any other country, if the water situation is examined in the country\u2019s capital, where the central offices of the federal government and all related institutions are located, there is no long-term plan for water availability in Islamabad its twin city of Rawalpindi despite the increasing need for water among the growing population.\nAt present, apart from Rawal Dam and Khanpur Dam, which depend on rainwater, water supply through tube wells is feasible while the most important water supply project for Islamabad and Rawalpindi districts for over 100 years, the Ghazi Barotha Water Supply Project is still pending after being considered by many governments in the past.\nThe cost of the Ghazi Barotha project, which has suffered the longest delay, has now reached Rs90 billion. Its project concept-1 (PC-1) has been sent to the Central Development Working Party (CDWP) by the Capital Development Authority (CDA), the executing agency of the project.\nIn the first phase of the project, 200 million gallons of water will be available per day of which 100 million gallons per day (MGD) of water is to be provided to the CDA, 50 MGD to the WASA and 50 MGD to the Rawalpindi Cantonment Board.\nThe cost of the project has been divided among the three institutions according to their water supply share, under which the CDA will be responsible to pay Rs45 billion and the WASA and RCB will pay Rs22.50 billion each.
