Around 150,000 people of Chontra and surrounding areas will get potable water for which water tanks will be built.\nThe construction of the Mujahid Dam will be finished in 30 months.\nOn the other hand, the Mohata Dam will be constructed in Raika, the densely populated union council of Rawalpindi District, at an estimated cost of Rs660.23 million and will help irrigate 6,000 acres of agricultural land in the area.\nSources said underwater tanks will be constructed and drinking water pipelines will also be laid in addition to the irrigation system alongside the dam.\nThe Mohata Dam will be constructed in a record-breaking period of 18 months, the sources claimed.\nThe two dams will be complemented by amusement parks with fruit and flower plants and thick forest trees grown in the Miyawaki forest style for the delight of the local inhabitants.\nAdditionally, these two dams will have motorboats for recreation while for the breeding of water birds, different types of fish will also be bred in these dams.\nThe dams will be built on government land, including their catchment areas. The contract for the construction of these dams will be awarded in the first week of May after the opening of bids on April 29.\nExperts say the groundwater level in Rawalpindi has plummeted while the water supply from Rawal and Khanpur dams has been slashed amidst high consumption of the vital commodity. In addition to this, the rapidly growing population, rising temperatures in the summers, and incessant droughts have made the construction of these dams crucial.\n\u00a0\nPublished in The Express
