The administration and related institutions seemed to look helpless before the water mafia.\nPrivate tankers continue to sell water from these hydrants to new housing societies in the city and Cantonment areas around the clock with per tanker costing up to Rs6,000, depending on the distance from the illegal hydrants to the intended area.\nSurprisingly, dozens of transformers have also been installed near these hydrants to supply uninterrupted electricity to the illegal hydrants connected to tube wells.\nIllegal hydrants have been installed in Cantonment areas, suburbs and on the bank of River Swan, from where water is being supplied further in tankers.\nCitizens of the garrison city were compelled to purchase tanker water at exorbitant costs.\nThe official said that the illegal water business was ongoing with impunity in areas such as Chakri Road, Adiala Road, Girja Road, Misryal Road, Chakra, Sadiq Abad, Gulzar E Quaid, Dhamyal, Dhok Syeddan, Dhok Chauhdrian, People\u2019s Colony, Tench, Harley Street, Lal Kurti, Tali Mohrri and other areas.\nThe WASA official further said that the launching of new water schemes was the only solution to get rid of the water mafia and illegal hydrants. He said that the government of Punjab should focus on the construction of small dams including the Dadocha Dam in Rawalpindi.\nAlthough the government claims to own the underground water reserves, in reality, the tanker mafia makes a profitable business through these illegal hydrants.\nStarting from the banks of the Swan River, the network of this illegal business extends to areas as far as Morgah, Gulraiz, Gulistan Colony, Lalazar and adjoining private housing societies in city and Cantonment areas.\nOwing to the illegal extraction of water, underground water reserves are rapidly tumbling. Citizens are compelled to buy the commodity at an exorbitant price as the government has failed to ensure water supply through its networks.\nAll allied departments including the Water and Sanitation Agency seem to be helpless in front of the influential tanker mafia connected to the illegal business.\nThe citizens, who are already suffering from hyperinflation, have demanded of the authorities concerned that they should be supplied water through government networks to get rid of buying the basic commodity at an unaffordable and high price.\nResidents of Gulistan Colony, Jahangir Shah, Malik Javed, Tanveer Shah, Khuram, Raja Basharat, Aijaz Shah and others said that there is a severe shortage of water in their area.
