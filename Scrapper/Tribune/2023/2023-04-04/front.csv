0,Loans required urgently to avert public debt crisis: World Bank,Says economic shocks pushed 3.9 million Pakistanis into poverty in FY2023,"The World Bank, on Tuesday, said that various economic shocks pushed nearly four million Pakistanis into poverty this fiscal year. The lender also urged Islamabad to immediately arrange fresh foreign loans to avert a “public debt crisis”.
The Pakistan Development Update – a flagship report from the lender, has warned Pakistan about serious dangers to its economic and debt viability while projecting almost flat economic growth, with an average inflation rate of 29.5% for the current fiscal year.
The future also remains “highly uncertain”, with only 0.4% economic growth projected this year and 2% for the next fiscal year. The average inflation rate for FY2023 is projected at 29.5% and at 18.5% for next year – indicating that the annual inflation rate will be much higher.
In the absence of public transfers that cover income losses or mitigate the impact of higher prices, “poverty is projected to increase to 37.2% in FY23, pushing an additional 3.9 million people into poverty as compared to last fiscal year,” according to the World Bank.

Poverty is measured at the lower middle-income poverty line, $3.65 per day based on 2017 PPPs per capita. The depth and severity of poverty has also increased, reflecting the overlapping impacts of multiple shocks and households’ lack of savings to mitigate short-term impacts.
The WB said that the inflation outlook suggested that real interest rates will remain in the negative, possibly warranting further policy tightening in the near-term.
Debt crisis
The World Bank emphasised that implementing macroeconomic and structural reforms agreed under the IMF programme and securing the much-needed external refinancing is critical to restoring macro-stability, confidence and “averting a public debt crisis”.
The WB language indicates growing discomfort among international creditors due to Pakistan’s dilly-dallying approach with the IMF.
The report stated that Pakistan’s external financing needs are projected to be, on average, $28.9 billion per year, or 8% of GDP, during FY23-FY25, including IMF repayments, maturing Eurobonds, and repayments against Chinese commercial loans. But the reserves position is projected to gradually improve.
In the current situation, the IMF programme is an anchor to staying on course for reforms, said Najy Benhassine, the Country Director of the WB. He added that this was not an easy time to write the Pakistan Development Update report.
“The outlook is highly uncertain and hinges on strong political ownership and effective implementation of critical reforms,” according to the report. It added that non-completion of the IMF programme and failure to secure expected rollovers, refinancing, and new financing from key bilateral partners presents major risks.
Currently, Pakistan has minimal economic buffers to withstand any additional domestic or external shocks, according to the report. Even with the IMF programme on-track, reserves are expected to remain precariously low. Maintaining stability will require that (IMF) programme reforms are sustained and deepened, with additional new external financing flows required over the medium-term.
“Downside risks to the outlook remain very high,” said Adnan Ghumman, author of the report. These include politically-driven slippages in fiscal policy in the context of upcoming elections, constraints on foreign exchange liquidity and uncertainties around external funding inflows, rising levels of public debt, growing exposure of banks to the public sector, and political instability, he added.
Ghumman said that the outflow of dollars has decreased by 80% during the first half of FY2023, which has impacted investor confidence.

Pakistan has effectively lost access to international capital markets, which is now making it difficult to arrange even $6 billion in additional loans to revive the IMF programme.
Any substantial departure from the current macroeconomic framework would exacerbate external and domestic financing risks, and potentially place debt on an unsustainable path, said Benhassine.
“The resolution of Pakistan’s economic crisis requires commitment to sustained macro-fiscal and structural reforms,” he said, adding that, “This is needed both to unlock fresh financing and avoid a balance of payments crisis and lay the foundation for a recovery of private investor confidence and higher growth over the medium term.”
Damaging import restrictions
The WB criticised the government’s approach to impose restrictions on imports which has resulted in significant erosion of trust.
“The government has taken ad hoc administrative measures to preserve scarce foreign exchange reserves, but these measures have weakened consumer and investor confidence,” reads the report. Private sector activity has been heavily impacted by import and dollar outflow controls, higher borrowing and fuel costs, and continued policy uncertainty leading to sharply slowing growth, it added.
The lender suggested that in order to maintain stability and set the foundations for medium-term recovery, the government has to sustain IMF programme reforms and continue to adhere to overall sound macroeconomic management, including maintaining a flexible exchange rate and independent monetary policy targeting inflation.
There is also a need to progressively remove all import and dollar outflow restrictions, including curbs on profit and dividend outflows, to restore investor confidence.
The fiscal deficit is projected to narrow to 6.7% of GDP in the FY2023 but is still high compared with Pakistan’s fiscal position.
The country’s fiscal deficit should be below 3.5% of the GDP and the debt-to-GDP ratio below 60%, said Derek Chen, a Senior Economist at the WB.
Pakistan’s large and persistent fiscal deficits threaten sustainability, stability, and economic growth, according to the report.
Govt-banking nexus
The report has also commented on the government’s growing reliance on commercial banks. The banking sector’s exposure to the sovereign has grown significantly in recent years, as loans surged by 444% over the June 2012–June 2022 period, according to the report.
This growth stands in steep contrast to growth in credit to the private sector, which stood at 170% over the same period. The rapid expansion in the banking sector’s exposure to the government has led to credit amounting to 68.3% of all the credit extended by the sector as of December 2022, up from 43% in June 2010.
“The sovereign, in effect, is the dominant borrower in the banking system,” said the WB.

1,Top court puts its foot down sets May 14 as date for Punjab polls,SC three-member bench declares ECP’s decision postponing provincial poll ‘unconstitutional’,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday declared as “unconstitutional” the Election Commission of Pakistan’s decision to postpone election in Punjab, in a blow to the government that has been trying to delay the provincial election citing security issues and the economic crisis.
The three-member bench — headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial and comprising Justice Munib Akhtar and Justice Ijazul Ahsan — also fixed May 14 as the date for the poll in the province.
On March 22, the ECP delayed the provincial assembly election in the politically crucial Punjab province by more than five months, citing the deteriorating security situation in the cash-starved country, a move criticised by PTI Chairman Imran Khan.
Since his ouster last April in a no-confidence vote in parliament, Imran has been demanding early elections. Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif has dismissed the demand and kept to elections scheduled for later this year.
The PDM government wanted national elections and the voting for the two provincial assemblies held on the same day.
“The impugned order dated 22.03.2023 made by the Election Commission of Pakistan is declared to be unconstitutional, without lawful authority or jurisdiction, void ab-initio, of no legal effect and is hereby quashed,” the ruling said.
“Neither the Constitution nor the law empowers the commission to extend the date of elections beyond the 90 days period as provided in Article 224(2) of the Constitution.”
“Elections in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa should be transparent, impartial and as per the law,” read the verdict.
It added that the federal government should provide Rs21 billion in funds by April 10 to the ECP and directed the body to present a report on the issue by April 11.
The verdict also said that the Supreme Court will issue instructions to the authorities concerned in case the funds are not provided.
“The Punjab government should give a security plan to the Election Commission,” said the top court’s verdict. It added that Punjab’s interim cabinet and chief secretary should report to the ECP on the electoral staff by April 10.
The verdict also directed the caretaker government to assist and provide resources to the electoral body for elections in Punjab.
Referring to elections in K-P, the Supreme Court recalled that the counsel of the K-P governor had withdrawn from appearance in court “on account of a certain stand taken by a political party which [the] learned counsel was also representing”.
“The Governor, K-P province, therefore, ceased to have representation before the court,” it maintained, pointing out that the matter on the election in K-P was not adjudicated upon.
“Permission is granted to the petitioners to file such petition and/or seek such relief before such forum as is deemed appropriate.”
Heavy security was deployed outside the apex court’s building, with a large contingent of police guarding the main entrance.
Earlier in the day, the Ministry of Defence, as per the apex court's directives, had submitted its report through Attorney General of Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Awan detailing the availability of security personnel for election duties.
After analysing the report, the top court announced its verdict and reinstated the previous schedule with amendments.
The apex court ordered returning officers to accept nomination papers until April 10, and publish the candidates' list by April 19.
The ruling further held that free and fair elections must be ensured on the new poll date.
The bench further noted that ""other issues were also raised during the proceedings"" and clarified that two judges had recused themselves from hearing the case.
The hearings in the case, which lasted over a week, witnessed high drama after two judges of the original five-member bench — Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Aminuddin Khan — recused themselves from hearing the case. Thereafter, the chief justice constituted a bench comprising himself, Justice Ahsan and Justice Akhtar to proceed with the PTI petition.
Earlier, the government had submitted a statement through AGP Awan, requesting the formation of a full court to hear the case. It also sought dismissal of the PTI petition in light of what it interpreted as a “4-3” order issued by the apex court on March 1.

2,Bilawal urges judiciary to stop repeating past errors,PPP chairman says he wants to see day when SC is standing on right side of history,"PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, who is also the country’s foreign minister, on Tuesday urged the superior judiciary to avoid repeating the history of pronouncing controversial orders which were motivated by politics rather than justice.
Bilawal, while addressing an event to observe the 44th martyrdom anniversary of his maternal grandfather, PPP founder and former premier Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in Larkana, dedicated an overwhelming part of his 39-minute speech on convincing the top court judges to form a larger bench to take up the matter of holding elections in Punjab.
Earlier in the day, a three-judge bench of the SC, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial, had fixed the elections in Punjab in May, declaring the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) decision to hold the polls in October as “unconstitutional”.
Bilawal said he wanted to witness when it would happen when the country's SC would make decisions while standing on the right side of history.
“The drama being played with the nation is based on ill-intentions,” he claimed.
“We demand that to stop this constitutional crisis and to preserve democracy, the Supreme Court should form a larger bench of all the judges, except those two who were caught talking to the opposition,” he added.
The PPP leader announced that if the proposed bench decided to hold the elections even after a day’s gap, his party would accept that decision.
He argued that the country, which stood divided. would accept the larger bench’s verdict.
“If there is no ill-intention, then tell us what is wrong with this demand?” he raised the question.
He reiterated that the ruling coalition emphatically demanded that the CJP and his brother judges in the SC should save the country.
He expressed his apprehensions, saying the fight over the “throne of Lahore” would drown the entire Pakistan, its federation and economy at a time when the country was coping with unprecedented inflation, redundancy and poverty.
To top it all, he added that terrorism was rearing its ugly head again in the country.
“If the constitutional crisis continues this way, neither [Prime Minister] Shehbaz Sharif nor I, or even [PTI chairman and deposed premier] Imran Khan will be there [in power],” he warned.
“Instead, there will be another dangerous experiment, whose price will be paid by the people and its burden carried by the coming generations,” he continued.
Bilawal maintained that at present, all the institutions appeared divided because of the element of hatred in politics.
He cautioned that if hatred was not done away with, ordinary people will have to pay the price.
“I urge all stakeholders to grasp the gravity of the situation,” he continued.
The PPP leader informed the gathering that he would request PM Shehbaz to send a reference to the judiciary in continuity of the 2012 one submitted by former president and party's co-chairperson, his father Asif Ali Zardari, to acquire justice for his grandfather, Bhutto.
He said his father went to the court again with the same case to seek justice for Bhutto in 2018, but the matter was not being heard.

“The people of Pakistan want justice for  Bhutto, who had embraced martyrdom,” he added.
He recalled that his grandfather Bhutto had fought for the rights of the ordinary people, especially labourers, peasants and women.
He said Bhutto had instituted an array of reforms, giving the country its Constitution and empowering the working class.
However, he blamed the judiciary for being hands in glove with military dictator Gen Ziaul Haq in rolling back the reforms and putting the Constitution in abeyance.
Bilawal said not only had the judiciary endorsed Gen Zia’s attack on the Constitution, democracy and rights of the people; but the convictions of PPP activists by military courts including death penalties were also upheld by the courts.
He also recalled that his mother, former premier Benazir Bhutto’s government elected in 1988, was allowed in the office only for less than two years.
“When her ouster was challenged in the court, the plea was dismissed,” he added.
However, he regretted that a similar plea to restore the president-sacked National Assembly submitted by former premier Nawaz Sharif was accepted in an apparently discriminatory move.
The PPP chairman also mentioned the way the SC had vindicated the 1999 coup of Gen Pervez Musharraf and even went on to allow him to amend the Constitution in the capacity of the country’s chief executive.
During the same time, his father remained incarcerated without conviction but the courts were not bothered to take up his case until he was released in 2005, after spending 11 years behind bars.
Bilawal blamed former CJP Iftikhar Chaudhry for introducing an autocratic stream of thought in the judiciary.
“[He introduced] the one-man one show which still exists today,” he continued.
However, he maintained that parliament and the nation, which had never accepted dictatorships, would not tolerate a similar tendency in the top court.
“Now who will save the Supreme Court from the Supreme Court?” he asked.
He pointed out that an unprecedented divide was evident in the ranks of the top court’s judges, where some of them were expressing their mistrust in others.
The PPP chairman said the ruling coalition did not want to see the mistakes of ex-CJP Saqib Nisar being repeated by the incumbent one.
He wished that CJP Bandial would be remembered by history with respect as a judge who saved the country from a constitutional crisis.
“However, the danger is that because of the ego of three judges, a constitutional crisis is taking us on a wrong and perilous path,” he cautioned.
Bilawal maintained that Imran was brought to power once by rigging, but he would not be allowed to do so again using the back door.

3,Govt says SC polls verdict ‘impractical order’ defies logic,Cabinet observes SC should not have gone in confrontational mode,"The executive and the judiciary -- two vital state organs -- seem to be on a collision course as the coalition government demonstrated its disdain over the apex court’s ruling, nullifying the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP)’s decision to delay election in Punjab till October 8 this year after initially announcing it to hold on April 30.
Hours after the Supreme Court’s verdict in the poll delay case filed by the PTI, the Centre expressed its reservations over the verdict in the federal cabinet as well as in the National Assembly, saying the decision was “against the principle of propriety of justice” and would worsen the political crisis in the country.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, while speaking in the lower house of parliament, did not hesitate in equating the top court verdict with the “judicial murder” of late premier Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, pointing out that both had happened on April 4 -- the day the PPP founder was hanged.
A three-judge SC bench, comprising Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial, Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Munib Akhtar, announced the verdict on the PTI's petition challenging the ECP’s move to postpone the Punjab Assembly polls till October.
The chief justice announced that the election in Punjab would be held on May 14 as the SC declared the ECP’s decision “unconstitutional”.
The government, however, has termed the verdict contrary to the judgments of the Supreme Court’s majority judges, saying it was an “impractical order”.
Tensions between the federal government and the apex court came to a boiling point after the top judge of the country continued hearing PTI’s plea against the delay in holding elections in Punjab within the constitutional limit of 90 days despite the ruling coalition’s reservations that later pushed it to explicitly express a lack of confidence in the CJP and two judges hearing the case with him.
Sources revealed that the cabinet, while gauging the situation arising out of the verdict, observed that the SC should not have gone in confrontational mode as there was no harm in forming a full court on the matter.
They added that the crux of the discussion in the cabinet was that the government could not endorse the top court dictating the ECP to hold the polls while disregarding all the aspects raised by the ruling coalition.
A cabinet member said holding the elections was the responsibility of the ECP and it could not be dictated.
The member added that the government was currently waiting for President Dr Arif Alvi to approve the bill, which clips the CJP’s discretionary powers of initiating suo motu proceedings as well as forming benches and then move ahead.
President Alvi has not yet signed the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Bill, 2023, which was passed by both houses of parliament.
A cabinet source said judicial reforms was a long-awaited demand that was fulfilled and the president should not delay signing the bill as it would help in ending the “one-man show” in the apex court.
PM Shehbaz said in the National Assembly that the federal cabinet was unanimous in demanding that the judicial reference pending against former premier Zulfikar Ali Bhutto should be taken up by a full court as the whole world knew that the former premier’s martyrdom was a “judicial murder”.

The prime minister recalled that one of the judges, who had given the decision against Bhutto, had later admitted about the wrongdoings in the matter.
The premier added that it was an irony of the history that Bhutto was hanged on April 4 -- the same date on which the SC had announced its judgment on the polls in Punjab.
“Just look at what has happened in the past 72 hours in connection with the elections,” PM Shehbaz said, adding that “justice has once again been murdered today”.
PM Shehbaz condemned the “judicial murder” of Bhutto amid desk thumping and slogans of “shame, shame” by the parliamentarians.
Before the prime minister delivered his speech, Law and Justice Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar maintained that two provincial assemblies in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa were dissolved just to satisfy the ego of a “stubborn man”, PTI chairman Imran Khan, and to create chaos in the country.
The law minister added that neither the CJP had formed a full bench, nor had he taken the option of restoring the previous bench or forming a new one comprising judges, who had not heard the matter yet.
Azam regretted that the SC had even issued a date for elections, saying a judgment from a full court would have expelled all the negative impressions associated with the case.
“We are not the ones running away from the elections,” the minister said at one point, saying an impression should not be given that any institution was allegedly involved in political engineering.
He added that state institutions should be careful and try their best to shun the impression that they were somehow facilitating the political engineering process.
Referring to the discussion in the federal cabinet, the law minister said the prime minister had directed him, the attorney general for Pakistan and the legal team to present recommendations after consulting with the stakeholders about the government's future course of action after the SC decision.
The minister claimed that the settled principle of propriety that “justice is not only done but is also seen to be done” was completely ignored in the polls delay case, adding that this allowed the parliamentarians to raise their voice against it.
Azam further said Fateha was offered for the PPP founder during the cabinet meeting.
He continued that subsequently, he was directed to inform the apex court about the federal cabinet’s decision that the proceedings on the “judicial murder” of Bhutto was pending for the past 12 years and it should immediately be taken up by a full court.
Azam said the cabinet had asked the law ministry to write to the SC for taking up the petition, hoping that the court might sit together for hearing the matter to address the “historic mistake”.
In a related development, Federal Information and Broadcasting Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said the verdict given by the three-member SC bench was contrary to the judgments of its majority judges.
“It is an ‘impractical order’ which will further deepen political and constitutional crises,” she wrote in a series of tweets.
The minister said the nation’s time and money would have been saved “if the ‘blue-eyed and impressionist’ [Imran] was directly given control of the PM’s House”.
Marriyum added that the decision given in the case “which was rejected by the senior judges is ‘unconstitutional’”.
She continued that constitutional matters should not be turned into issues of ego as it would be detrimental to the country.
The information minister further wrote that the people were paying the price for the decision, which had disqualified the thrice-elected prime minister Nawaz Sharif in 2017 and caused perpetual economic, political and constitutional crises.
“The facilitation of Imran Khan is unacceptable,” she added.

4,Tension with CJP comes to a boil as govt fires SC registrar,Cabinet transfers official for disregarding judge’s order,"In an astonishing development, the federal cabinet on Monday threw its weight behind the senior Supreme Court judge, Justice Qazi Faez Isa, instead of Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial, as it ordered removal of the top court’s registrar as sought by Justice Isa after the registrar “disregarded” one of his orders at the behest of the top judge the other day.
The Establishment Division issued a notification after approval from the cabinet to remove SC registrar Ishrat Ali from his post.
He was directed to report to the Establishment Division.
The face-off between the federal government and CJP Bandial escalated soon after the top judge of the country continued hearing PTI’s plea against the delay in holding elections in Punjab within the constitutional limit of 90 days despite the ruling coalition’s reservations that later on pushed them to explicitly express no confidence in the CJP and two judges hearing the case with him.
Taking an advantage of the apparent schism between the CJP and some judges of the apex court, the federal cabinet hurriedly gathered at the Prime Minister House on Monday evening in a special meeting convened to discuss the two-point agenda – one being the removal of the SC registrar as desired by Justice Isa.
The special cabinet meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, considered the issue of registrar issuing a circular against the order of Justice Isa.
Following the discussion, the cabinet decided to withdraw the services of SC registrar and directed him to report to the Establishment Division – an apparent attempt to embarrass CJP and convey the message that things have reached a point of no return.
The federal cabinet’s decision to remove SC registrar has come hours before a three-member bench of the apex court comprising CJP Bandial, Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Munib Akhtar is all set to announce judgment in Punjab polls’ delay case.
The court reserved the judgment on Monday and announced that it would announce it on April 4, Tuesday (today).
The drama began unfolding when the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had delayed elections in Punjab till October 8 citing lack of funds and concern about security after initially announcing April 30 as the poll date for the province.
The government has been insisting on holding elections after the completion of its constitutional term in August this year. It has expressed its strong desire that the three-member bench, which has reduced in size from nine members to the current composition, should abstain from hearing the matter. Instead, the government has urged the formation of a full court to deliberate and decide on the legal and constitutional issues at stake in this matter.
However, the CJP while urging the political parties to lower the “toxic” rhetoric has been pushing the ECP to hold polls within the stipulated period of 90 days or a date closer to that – a direction which resonates with PTI’s demand to hold polls in 90 days after the assembly’s dissolution.
It seems that the registrar is caught in the middle of a power struggle between influential parties. Justice Isa recently asked that the Establishment Division relinquish Ali from his duties for disregarding a judicial order related to suo motu proceedings. In response, the federal cabinet quickly took action.
On March 31, the Supreme Court disregarded a judgment authored by Justice Isa, which had ordered the postponement of suo motu cases until amendments were made to the SC Rules 1980. These amendments would address the discretionary powers of the chief justice to form benches.
In its circular issued by the SC registrar, CJP Bandial noted that the observations made by the majority judgment in paras 11 to 22 and 26 to 28 were beyond the matter fixed before the court and “invokes its suo motu jurisdiction”.
The SC registrar said that the order violated the rules laid down by a five-member judgment.
In response to the registrar’s circular, Justice Isa asked the Establishment Division to “recall its officer, Mr Ishrat Ali, to prevent him from further damaging the reputation and integrity of the Supreme Court”.
“And, if you consider appropriate to initiate disciplinary proceedings against him in accordance with the applicable laws as he has apparently violated the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the order of the Supreme Court dated 29 March 2023, passed in Suo Motu Case No. 4 of 2022,” the note issued by Justice Isa read.
Meanwhile, the cabinet also demanded of President Dr Arif Alvi to sign The Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Bill, 2023, immediately so that the country could get rid of the constitutional and political crisis.
Recently, the federal government had passed the bill from the National Assembly and the Senate, clipping CJP Bandial’s powers to initiate suo motu proceedings and to constitute benches on his own, proposing that a three-member committee should decide such matters.
The president, who belongs to PTI, however, has yet to sign the bill, preventing it from becoming a law for the time being.
Law Minister Senator Azam Nazeer Tarar and Attorney General for Pakistan briefed the federal cabinet on various issues and about the proceedings that took place before the Supreme Court before it reserved the decision.

5,Lawyers back supremacy of Constitution,Ahsan urges Rabbani to speak up on ‘constitutional crisis’,"As the coalition government moves to reduce the power of the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) to take suo motu notice alone and delay elections in the Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa assemblies, the Lawyers’ Convention held here on Monday passed a resolution throwing its weight behind the “supremacy of Constitution”. The resolution was presented by Faisal Chaudhry Advocate.
Last week, both houses of parliament passed the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Bill 2023, aimed at limiting the top judge’s suo motu powers in an individual capacity.
Addressing the Lawyers’ Convention via video link on Monday, PPP leader Barrister Aitzaz Ahsan noted that efforts were being made to delay elections in Punjab and K-P. He suggested that those responsible for providing security were trying to prevent the polls from being held, and added that for the first time, the Constitution was not being implemented, in a veiled reference to the establishment.
Ahsan called on PPP leader Senator Raza Rabbani – architect of the 18th Amendment, which curtailed the president’s power to dissolve the National Assembly and transferred political and economic powers to the provinces – to speak up on the current “constitutional crisis”. He urged lawyers to uphold the Constitution rather than following the doctrine of necessity.
Ahsan praised Supreme Court Justice Qazi Faez Isa, calling him a courageous judge, and said that “clipping the powers of CJP meant that his (Justice Isa’s) authority was also being limited”. He also said that Justice Isa had given a verdict against him when he was the Balochistan High Court Chief Justice, but that he was “impressed by his courage”.
On the government’s efforts to curtail the CJP’s powers, Ahsan metaphorically said, “chains that are used to tie CJP Umar Ata Bandial’s feet will also be used for you (Justice Isa) tomorrow”. He urged Justice Isa to support CJP Bandial, who he said was standing as a custodian of the Constitution.
On Wednesday, a special bench of the Supreme Court, with a two-to-one majority, ordered that all suo motu cases be suspended – under Article 184(3) of the Constitution – until amendments were made to the apex court rules governing the chief justice's discretionary powers.
The special bench order came in response to the suo motu case related to examining the award of additional 20 marks to Hafiz-e-Quran candidates applying for enrolment to an MBBS/BDS degree. Justice Isa headed the bench, which comprised Justice Aminuddin Khan and Justice Shahid Waheed. However, Justice Isa objected to the constitution of the bench, arguing that it was not properly constituted.

6,No breakthrough in internal SC dispute,Egoistic approach of judges leading towards complete superior judiciary breakdown,"An egoistic approach of the Supreme Court judges is leading to a complete breakdown in the superior judiciary wherein both sides may be losers.
During the hearing on a matter related to the delay in general elections of the provincial assemblies on Monday, Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial revealed that he held a meeting with senior puisne Judge Justice Qazi Faez Isa in order to end internal dispute.
He also added that efforts are being made to convene a full court meeting.
Meanwhile, Justice Isa wrote two letters related to removal of the SC registrar on account of issuing a circular which discarded his judicial order.

Likewise, Justice Isa and Justice Sardar Tariq Masood also wrote to the head and other members of the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) for initiating proceedings on the complaints of misconduct against Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi.
These developments prove that there is no breakthrough in the meeting held between CJP Bandial and Justice Isa.
Advocate Faisal Siddiqi said that the current judicial cold war among the two groups of judges can now easily be converted into a possible judicial civil war if further judicial orders are passed by restraining rival benches from proceeding with their cases or clarificatory circulars are issued regarding judicial orders.
""Such a judicial civil war will ultimately lead to a complete breakdown of a unitary Supreme Court leading ultimately to what happened in 1997 ie, separate cause list being issued and judges suspending each other’s judicial proceedings.
""But unlike 1997, if such a constitutional breakdown at the Supreme Court level occurs, it is likely that some kind of unconstitutional intervention will take place by a non-political third force, which may ultimately lead to a purging/removal of independent judges from the Supreme Court,"" Siddiqi said.
He wondered as why the CJP is scared from dissent of judges.
However, another lawyer also wondered whether both sides of the judges are performing duties for the rule of law or to get supremacy from each other.
Irfan Qadir, counsel for the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), had also urged CJP Bandial to negotiate with fellow judges and redress their grievances.
Currently, CJP Bandial and President Arif Alvi and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf are standing on the one side while Justice Qazi Faez Isa, PDM government and establishment on the other.
Lawyers are also divided. The representatives of Professional Lawyers Group are backing the SC section led by CJP Bandial while the Independent Lawyers Group is supporting the other section of judges in the apex court.
Despite demands of senior lawyers, no full court meeting has been being held for the last three years. The CJP is taking all administrative decisions unilaterally.
The Supreme Court is still facing a shortage of two judges. It is being presumed that the CJP has no majority votes in the JCP to approve his nominations for their appointment as SC judges.

There are hardliners on both the sides.
The judges who have balancing views, can play a reconciliation role in the prevailing situation as legitimacy of the institution is at stake. The CJP can also review his policy to include majority of like-minded judges in the larger/special benches.
The current divide within the SC started since Justice Qazi Faez Isa case in May 2019.
Senior lawyers still believed that constitution of a full court comprising all 15 judges is the only solution to end the controversy.
