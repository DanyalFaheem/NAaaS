0,Kunri residents accuse BISP of fostering corruption,"Beneficiaries say women face undue deductions, harassment at centres","The Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) which was rolled out to provide unconditional cash handouts to the extremely poor has become a serious form of corruption and tool of humiliation for poor women due to government’s inattention, said community leaders of Kunri, a major town of the Umerkot district in the greater Tharparkar Desert.
The village women do not know how to operate the automated teller machines (ATMs) due to which agents sitting outside ask them to pay Rs500 to withdraw the allocated sum of Rs3,000, said Abdul Moneem Khan, an educationist and community mobiliser.
For online wallet payments, the device owners take a cut of up to Rs1,500 from the poverty-hit women while expressing shock that “the government had chosen to turn a blind eye to corruption at the grass-root level.” He claimed that unscrupulous BISP officials, local administration, police, device owners, and their agents are active at the BISP device shops and ATMs in the banks at various places.
Some of these characters sometime deprive women of the entire amount, said local Anwar Arain.
Arain said that some policemen were in the habit of harassing women gathered at ATMs.
“They perform lewd acts and humiliate the women, who stay silent out of fear of further disgrace, he said.
He said some officials promise these women greater compensation to rob them of the entire amount.
They demanded action against corrupt officers and device owners and to provide due protection to women withdrawing cash under the BISP programme.

2,"SHO killed, DSP injured in operation against dacoits in riverine areas","SSP says criminals used anti-aircraft guns, rocketpropelled grenades on police APCs","A police official was martyred and two others besides a passerby man and a woman sustained gunshot injuries during the police operation against dacoits in a riverine forest in Kashmore-Kandhkot district on Monday.
SHO Jamal Abdul Latif Mirani died in the encounter with the robbers, while DSP Qalandar Bux Soomro and Constable Ishq Mirani were injured.
The injured citizens have been identified as Deen Muhammad and Mai Hajani.
SSP Irfan Samo talking to the media claimed that 11 to 12 dacoits were also killed in the operation, but police could not retrieve bodies of the slain outlaws due to heavy gunfire.
According to the SSP, three separate gangs of dacoits attacked a police party moving in armoured personnel carriers (APCs) in the limits of Durrani Mehar police station in Kandhkot.
Samo claimed that the outlaws used anti-aircraft guns and rocket propelled grenades (RPGs) during the exchange of fire.
The anti-aircraft battery of the dacoits had armourpiercing bullets that went through the thick body of APC vehicles.
DSP Soomro was the first to sustain a gunshot, police said.
He was moved out from the katcha area to the government hospital in Kandhkot from where he was referred to Sukkur district.
SHO Jamal Abdul Latif Mirani later sustained a fatal gunshot and died on the spot, while Constable Ishq Mirani was also injured.
The operation continued through the day but it was stopped in the evening.
A large number of citizens reached the hospital where the SHO’s body was brought.
They paid tribute to the police for taking action against the dacoits and sacrificing their lives in the action.
Many people were seen kissing the body of the martyred cop.
The SSP’s claim about killing 11 to 12 dacoits cannot be verified by the evening.
Neither the names of the slain suspects could be known nor the dacoits revealed any deaths.

3,Sheikh seeks legal fraternity’s support for ‘resistance movement’,Says govt's resistance against SC polls orders has put constitution in danger,"Leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh asserted that the delay in holding elections in Punjab and Khyber- Pakhtunkhwa provinces and ignoring the Supreme Court’s order in this regard has put the country’s existence and the Constitution in danger.
Addressing the Insaf Lawyers Forum at Hyderabad District Bar on Monday, Sheikh urged the legal fraternity to be ready for a movement of a political resistance to protect the Constitution and the rule of law.
“Some powers don’t want to see the supremacy of the constitution and law in Pakistan.
But this isn’t possible because the world has changed.” He said the Pakistan Muslim League- Nawaz led government was trying to repeat history as it has planned to mete out the same treatment to the incumbent chief justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial it had given to former CJP Syed Sajjad Ali Shah.
He argued that the government was trying to weaken the judiciary so that they do not face unfavourable judgments.
“The constitution given by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto is in danger.
It is now the responsibility of Bhutto’s son in law Asif Ali Zardari and grandson PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari to play their part to protect it.” The Insaf Lawyers Forum’s Advocate Noorul Haq Qureshi read out the 11-point resolution on the occasion.
He said restricting the authority of the CJP is tantamount to a direct attack on the institution of the judiciary.

5,SHC hears plea for recovery of missing PTI activist,Court upholds death sentence over murder during street robbery,"The Sindh High Court (SHC) has issued notices to all parties including the secretary of the Interior department, the Sindh police chief, the head of the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) of the Crime Investigation Unit (CIA) and the provincial advocate general while hearing a plea regarding the recovery of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) social media activist Muhammad Salman Khan.
Justice Naimatullah Phulpoto headed the twomember bench headed that heard the petition.
The petitioner’s counsel said that Salman had been missing after he participated in the PTI demonstration at Karachi Press Club.
The counsel said there were concerns that the activist might be implicated in a false case.
The lawyer told the court that the Artillery Maidan police station was not registering a first information report (FIR) on their complaint while requesting the court to order them to do so.
The court issued notices to the parties concerned and sought their response by April 10.
Missing persons Meanwhile, the SHC bench heard the petitions related to the recovery of MQM workers and other missing persons.
The petitioner’s counsel submitted that MQM workers Fahimullah and Muhammad Saqib went missing from Clifton in 2015.
The court expressed ire at the performance of the joint investigation team (JIT) working on the recovery of missing persons.
What is the use of such JITs in which there is no progress, Justice Phulpoto was quoted as saying.

6,Inflation dampens Ramazan spirit,"Populace forced to turn towards dastarkhwans, seek free rations","It would not be amiss to label this Ramazan as the costliest one in the past few decades, as unprecedented levels of inflation have decimated the purchasing power of the people, who are turning towards free meal centres or organisations distributing rations, to be able to fast.
In the country’s most populated city, the poor and working class are distraught that every day brings a new increase in commodity prices, which makes it impossible for them to stick to their Ramazan budget.
Consequently, many have given up on their desire to have a filling Suhoor and Iftar, instead opting for whatever meal is the cheapest to put together.
For Akram, who runs a vegetable stall in the port city and makes between Rs 800 to Rs 1,200 per day, the only affordable meal is bread and curry.
“We are a family of five and a proper Iftari or Sehri has become a distant dream for us.
Hence, we start our fast with roti and tea; and break it with roti and curry,” he lamented.
While the essence of Ramazan is being able to feel the daily plight of the destitute, Akram never imagined that economic conditions would deteriorate to an extent that he would be grateful for the precious little he had to eat.
Begum Muqqadas Khan can relate to Akram, as this is the first Ramazan in her memory that she has not been able to arrange Sehri and Iftari essentials.
“With the high electricity and gas bills, we can barely afford to buy rations now.
So we have to make do with either rice or pulses for iftar.” However, others like Yasmeen Khalida, a resident of Punjab Colony, who works as a maid, do not even have the luxury of making do with whatever little they have.
“I have to solely rely on the leftover food I get from the houses I work at for keeping a fast,” said Yasmeen.
And yet, there is a segment of the populace, amongst the mammoth headcount in Karachi, which is even more worse off than Yasmeen, as it has no option but to turn to dastarkhwans.
Amongst this segment is Shujaat, who is a daily wage labourer and was trying to get a meal for his family and himself at a free meal centre in Kharadar.
“The money I make is not enough to feed my family of five, so I have to come here every day to take some food home, which we then share,” a visibly upset Shujaat informed.
However, Shujaat is not alone in his plight, as Asif Iqbal, a philanthropist who organises Ramazan dastarkhwans, reported a significant upsurge in the number of people visiting for free meals this year.
Asif told The Express Tribune that the economic conditions had truly battered the populace of Karachi, evidenced by the droves of people visiting the various dastarkhwans across the city.
Seconding Asif, another philanthropist from the city, Ahmed Raza Tayyab, said, “the number of people visiting mosques and imambargahs for food at Sehri and Iftari is an unprecedented amount.” With this increase in the number of people looking for a free meal or free rations, the costs for philanthropists and welfare organisations, given the double-digit inflation, have increased manifold as well.
“Distributing food and rations amongst the destitute has become an incredibly pricey exercise this Ramazan,” complained Haji Salman, a resident of Clifton, who does a free rations drive every year during the Holy Month.
Agreeing with Salman, a volunteer of a charitable organisation, Imran Akram, informed that not only had the prices of free rations and food gone up but the demand had gone up as well, which meant that organisations like his were incurring massive costs and would not be able to sustain the free ration drives during the entirety of Ramazan.
Sharjeel Naeem Khan, a grocery shop owner who prepares ration bags on order, testified that Imran’s claims vis a vis hefty costs were correct.
“Prices of ration bags have gone up by Rs 2,000 to Rs 5,000 due to the increase in flour, sugar, oil, and lentil rates.” Resultantly, Imran’s warning that charity organisations will not be able to sustain the ration drives this Ramazan, is already coming true, merely a week into the Holy Month.
“It was easy to get free ration last year but this time around the lines are long and the quantity of commodities given in the bag have decreased,” grumbled Farzah, who was standing in queue for a free ration drive.
