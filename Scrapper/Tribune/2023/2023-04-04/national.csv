0,Pak Suzuki extends plant shutdown,Closure due to shortage of inventory,"Pak Suzuki Motor Company (PSMC) has announced that its motorcycle plant will remain shut until April 15th, and its automobile plant operations will be suspended from April 7th to April 14th. This decision was made due to the ongoing import restrictions that have affected the auto sector, causing a shortage of inventory.
Last month, PSMC had already shut down its motorcycle plant for 12 days due to a lack of raw materials, but the automobile plant remained operational.
The Chairman of the Association of Pakistan Motorcycle Assemblers (APMA), Muhammad Sabir Shaikh, expressed concern over the shortage of completely knocked down (CKD) parts in the country’s bikes and automobile industry.
“The unavailability of CKD parts has led to the suspension of production lines and a decrease in the number of customers for new cars and motorcycles. Furthermore, no new letter of credits (LCs) are being issued, and the price of CKD parts have surged to unprecedented levels, resulting in a sharp increase of over 22% in the markup on leasing of cars, making it more difficult for customers to afford new vehicles,” lamented Shaikh.
The APMA chairman stated that the current situation is the worst the auto industry has ever faced in the history of Pakistan. To alleviate the crisis, the government must take immediate action and allow the import of 660cc cars and vans to overseas Pakistanis on easy terms. He urged the government to take prompt measures to address the current crisis and facilitate the auto industry in the country.
Pakistan’s auto sector is currently facing several crises. Other listed companies, such as Indus Motor Company Limited and Honda Atlas Cars, have also had to halt production in recent months due to economic difficulties. Honda Atlas Cars Pakistan had to extend the shutdown of its plant by 15 days, making this its longest shutdown to date. Other automakers, including Indus Motor Company Limited, have also been forced to halt production intermittently.
According to the Finance Division Economic Adviser’s Wing Monthly report of March 2023, the auto-industry’s performance remained subdued due to massive increases in input prices, tightening auto finance, and import restrictions. Car production and sales decreased by 43.14% and 47.5%, respectively, during the July to February period of FY2023, while trucks and buses production and sales decreased by 31.2% and 29.9%.
Former chairman of the Pakistan Association of Automotive Parts & Accessories Manufacturers (PAAPAM), Abdul Rehman Aizaz, expressed his concerns about the industry’s future. He said, “The government forbids the import of components or raw materials. From now, the categories for tractors and motorcycles will decline even more. The industry can recover to 40% of the quantities seen in 2021–2022 if imports are permitted.”
He further added that 60% of the market has already been affected by significant devaluation and new tariffs, and it will take at least three years to reach the 300,000-automobile volume once more, which is a very poor omen for the prospects for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). He also worries about losing a million jobs in Pakistan’s auto industry.
Despite a significant price increase and an increase in taxes, the auto sector’s taxes will not even reach 50% in dollars this year, he said.

1,Utility MD accused of hiding Rs620m assets,FBR seeks explanation for not reporting assets held in Houston,"The managing director of Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) is facing allegations of concealing assets and tampering with Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs) of company officials.
Documents revealed that MD Imran Maniar had received notices from the FBR and FIA. The FBR, in its notice under Section 122(9) of the existing rules, sought explanation from Maniar for the concealment of assets (12 properties in total) worth Rs620 million in Houston in his wealth tax return for 2021-22.
The notice stated that through the concealment of assets, Maniar had tried to deprive the government of tax amount in the form of capital value tax (CVT) worth Rs6.2 million calculated at the rate of 1%.
When asked for comment, an SSGC spokesperson responded that Maniar would reply to the tax authorities concerned through his tax consultant.
Regarding FIA investigation, the spokesperson said that the MD would reply through his legal attorney.
The FIA began investigation following a complaint from senior officers, who accused Maniar and others of tampering with their ACRs and forging signatures while their supervisors were not even consulted as per rules and regulations. It was alleged that Maniar signed ACRs even for the period he had not been at SSGC.
Meanwhile, the FIA Corporate Crime Circle Karachi, in a notice addressed to the SSGC MD, said that response from his side was still awaited. FIA investigation officer said that he was engaged in an inquiry pertaining to alleged forgery/ tampering with ACRs/ performance appraisal forms of SSGC general manager for the period from 2018 to date. 
The FIA sought the names of officers who initiated, countersigned, approved and recommended the performance appraisal forms of the general manager. It also asked for appointing a focal person to assist the agency in the interest of justice.

2,The power of policy: propelling PTVC’s growth,PTVC recently opened a bid to create OTT platform that will exclusively stream its original content,"In 2021, PTVC ran an Expression of Interest to choose the right partner for airing the International Cricket Council (ICC) tournaments.
Potential partner was required to have access to a satellite channel and experience in selling advertising during sports broadcasts. The bids came from a consortium of ARY and GroupM and HBL PSL’s founding partner Blitz Advertising.
A review committee awarded top score to Blitz Advertising, which the relevant PTVC directors of finance, sports, engineering, commercial, and administration vetted. It was explicitly stated that the deal from Blitz Advertising beat every single measure of credibility.
Despite this, the intervention of the former MoIB and the chairperson of PTVC led the deal to be awarded to a consortium of ARY and GroupM. It’s worth mentioning that ARY had no sports channel when it was awarded the contract, which makes its selection even more baffling. The media company had already secured the maximum number of channel licences from Pemra.
The board of directors ignored all concerns raised by management regarding awarding the deal to the consortium with the lowest possible scores. It is not clear whether the board’s chairperson was politically motivated or financially inclined. Nor was it clear that the awarded TV channel would frame news that favoured the image of the party they represented.
In the aftermath of this deal, in which the chairperson of the PTVC board interfered, the state broadcaster suffered losses. The FIA was tasked with probing into an agreement between PTV Sports and the aforementioned private channel.
Sources shared that the investigation has concluded that PPRA rules were violated by the board’s chairperson and the former MoIB.
Post-investigation power handover in 2022
In the aftermath of the FIA’s investigation into the board chairperson’s interference in handing over the ICC deal to ARY and GroupM, during the 256th meeting between the board of directors concluded that its role oversees business strategy without interference.
The board was reminded that they were tasked to make policy decisions to ensure that the goals and targets of the organisation were met effectively and efficiently. Hence, the board may not be implicated in administrative matters.
The board currently includes PTVC chairperson and MoIB secretary Shahera Shahid, ISPR Director General Major General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, Budget Secretary Muhammad Tanveer Butt, Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation Director General Muhammad Tahir Hassan, and MoIB Principal Information Officer Mubashir Hassan.
PTVC without board interference in 2023
With PTV content streaming digitally on YouTube channels operated by multiple mom-and-pop operators for many years, the content was exploited without any revenue to PTVC while the YouTube channel operators collected advertising money.
To solve this and expand its media ecosystem, PTVC recently opened a bid to create an over-the-top (OTT) platform that would exclusively stream its original content.
The expression of interest calls for developing an OTT application that PTV would own. It would showcase PTV content, which PTV will continue to own, and PTV would pay zero cost for the development or maintenance of the app.
Sweet deal for PTV, which is being questioned because numbers are being quoted without context, highlighted without proper proof, and aimed at creating doubt where there isn’t any reason.
The conclusion of the bid went to Z2C Limited, an accelerator known for investing in MarTech start-ups that bring transparency to the media supply chain.
The accelerator reportedly removed pirated PTV content from the internet, built the OTT app from scratch, is embarking on a campaign to market the app, attracted app downloads, and gradually pave the way for the revival of quality local content. Interestingly, this also aligns with the firm’s investment thesis.
The last thing a loss-making state enterprise needs is to mull over whether to go with a 10% profitable deal with an ecosystem investor or a 40% loss-making deal with a company with no track record of monetization. In simple mathematics, 40% of 20 will always be lower than 10% of 100.
With the Google Play Store showing under 100,000 downloads and analytics engines showing the app is popular outside Pakistan, it would suggest that the Pakistani diaspora has found their official avenue to relive a life left behind.
Amid the CAD crisis and the trend of dollars exiting the country for YouTube and Meta, the state broadcaster hoped that this strategic investment would be Pakistan’s response to ensure that the local creator ecosystem is revived.

3,OPEC+ cuts put $100/bbl oil back in sight,Announced further cuts of 1.16 million bpd from May,"Surprise new cuts to the OPEC+ group’s output targets could push oil prices towards $100 a barrel, setting the scene for another clash with the West grappling with higher interest rates, analysts and traders said on Monday.
The decision signals unity within OPEC+ despite Washington’s pressure on its Gulf allies to weaken their ties with Moscow, while also undermining the West’s efforts to limit Russia’s oil income.
Oil prices jumped over 6% on Monday after the OPEC+ announced on Sunday further production target cuts of about 1.16 million barrels per day (bpd) from May through the rest of the year.
The pledges will bring the total volume of cuts by the group known as OPEC+ since November to 3.66 million bpd equal to 3.7% of global demand.
Saudi Arabia said its voluntary output cut was a precautionary measure aimed at supporting market stability. 
The IEA said the cuts risk exacerbating a strained market and pushing up oil prices amid inflationary pressures.
“The new cuts are underpinning that the OPEC+ group is intact and that Russia is still an integral and important part of the group,” said Bjarne Schieldrop, analyst at SEB.

4,Rupee just Rs0.05 away from all-time low,Loses 0.44% at Rs285.04 vs dollar in inter-bank dealings,"Pakistani rupee hit a one-month low at Rs285.04 against the US dollar in inter-bank market on Monday, just Rs0.05 away from the all-time low of Rs285.09/$ touched in the first week of February 2023.
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reported that the rupee dropped by 0.44%, or Rs1.25, and closed at Rs285.04/$.
A senior analyst said that the notable drop in the rupee’s value came following increase in import payment pressure while the supply of dollars remained limited.
Market talk suggests that a delay in revival of the IMF loan programme caused panic among importers, who scrambled to buy dollars at higher prices. Consequently, the rupee fell notably during the day.
Heightened political instability in the country is playing a key role in economic meltdown, piling more pressure on the rupee.
Latest reports suggest that Finance Minister Ishaq Dar will lead an economic team to the US to attend annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank from April 10 to 16. He is expected to make renewed efforts to persuade the IMF to revive its loan programme for Pakistan. The analyst hoped the government would succeed in two to three weeks.
“The rupee will make a partial recovery after the IMF’s resumption and the release of the $1.1 billion loan tranche,” he said. Following the IMF’s nod, other multilateral and bilateral creditors will also unlock financial commitments of around $9 billion, made for flood relief at the Geneva conference in January 2023.
Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves have already depleted to $4.24 billion, barely enough for one month of imports.
The low reserves have caused a massive decline in imports of raw material, led to the closure of factories and rendered millions jobless.

5,Analysts see 100-200 bps hike in policy rate,SBP’s monetary policy committee meeting today to decide on rate revision,"Pakistan’s central bank is expected to jack up the benchmark policy rate in the range of 100 to 200 basis points (bps) at its meeting on Tuesday in a bid to meet a key condition of the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) loan programme.
The policy rate is already at a record high of 20%. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) argues that a high rate increases the cost of borrowing, which helps to control demand for bank financing from businesses and households and reduce consumer demand for goods. Consequently, it reins in inflation and ensures sustainable economic growth. Analysts pointed out that inflation had hit a six-decade high at 35.4% in March 2023 and projected that it would peak out somewhere in the range of 37-40% over the next two months.
A section of analysts, however, argue the persistent rate hikes have lately become ineffective in controlling inflation, as the demand for bank credit has gone dead. Rather, the rate increase will dent economic activities.
The central bank has increased the policy rate cumulatively by 13 percentage points in the past 18 months.
Ismail Iqbal Securities Head of Research Fahad Rauf, while quoting media reports, pointed out that the IMF had demanded an aggressive increase of five to six percentage points in policy rate in February.
The central bank, however, was not in favour of such a staggering increase in one go. Following that approach, the central bank increased the policy rate by three percentage points to 20% by March.
“It is now expected to further raise the rate by two percentage points in line with the IMF’s recommendation,” Rauf said.
“The policy rate has become ineffective since surpassing the 15% mark (in November 2022) as demand for bank credit has dried up since then,” he said.
“Later, further hikes have badly impacted economic growth, which is likely to contract slightly in the current fiscal year compared to 6% expansion last year (FY22).”
Rauf was of the view that inflation had become a big challenge, which spiked after the government let the rupee depreciate significantly, increased energy prices and raised tax rates on the IMF’s recommendation.
He expected inflation to reach its peak in the range of 38-40% over the next two months.
Pak-Kuwait Investment Company Head of Research Samiullah Tariq said that the SBP would increase the policy rate by two percentage points to control the runaway inflation.
Rate hikes had helped restrain inflation, he said, adding had the central bank not increased the policy rate, inflation would have been higher than the prevailing levels.
Tariq estimated that inflation would peak in the range of 37-39% in April and May and after that it would start decelerating gradually.
The SBP has recently revised up its projection for average inflation to 27-29% for the current fiscal year.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL) Head of Research Tahir Abbas, in a commentary, said that the SBP would increase the key policy rate by one percentage point.
“Inflation is likely to remain elevated in the coming months as the impact of external and fiscal adjustments (including additional taxation, tariff hike, weakening currency and Ramazan factor) is felt,” he said.
“Besides…the decision to raise the policy rate will also facilitate the long-awaited ninth review of the IMF, which is crucial for Pakistan as it will pave the way for a loan tranche of $1.2 billion and unlock inflows from other international creditors.”
Topline Research, in its note, stated that it expected a one to two-percentage-point increase in policy rate in the upcoming Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting considering the higher-than-expected inflation and rupee devaluation against the US dollar.
“We see the Consumer Price Index (CPI)-based inflation to average around 28% in FY23 (compared to around 11% last year).”

6,Trade deficit at $23b in nine months of FY23,Steeper reduction in imports was offset by dip in exports,"Pakistan booked a trade deficit of $23 billion during the first nine months of this fiscal year – 83% of the annual target – as steeper reduction in imports was offset by an unwarranted dip in exports.
The Pakistan Bureau of Statistics reported on Monday that the shortfall between imports and exports was down $12.6 billion, or 35.5%, year-on-year (YoY). The decline was due to the government halting virtually all imports except for a few prioritised goods.
The annual export target was set to $38 billion, but only 56% of this was achieved in the first nine months. According to the PBS, exports totalled $21 billion, down by $2.3 billion, or 10%, YoY while imports amounted to $44 billion, down by $15 billion, or 25% YoY.
Although lower imports helped contain the current account deficit to around $4 billion, it has camouflaged the rapid deterioration in exports. Exporters – currently living and growing on state subsidies and duty-free quotas – have failed miserably in taking advantage of the steep currency devaluation at a time when the government has started dragging its feet on reviving the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme.
The fall in imports is also temporary, caused by administrative controls, which led to banks not to clear letters of credit (LC) and creating other administrative hurdles. The government had projected imports to be around $65.6 billion by the end of the current fiscal year. It is 68% of that target in nine months. The central bank is being asked by the IMF to withdraw its instructions issued to the banks for priority allocation of the sacred foreign currency.
The PBS stated that, on a YoY basis, exports contracted by 15% in March, standing at $2.4 billion, while imports dropped by over 40% in the same month. The yearly trade deficit narrowed by 60% to $1.5 billion in March with the monthly trade deficit shrinking by one-fifth last month as exports rose by 8% and imports fell by 5%.
The Monetary Policy Committee of the State Bank is meeting today (Tuesday) to review its interest rate, currently at 20% but below the IMF’s demanded rate.
The SBP governor met with the finance minister in a closed-door meeting on Monday – a day before the announcement of the new monetary policy. The new interest rate will also be seen as an indication of Pakistan’s commitment to the IMF programme.

7,Rs6 hike for KE consumers likely,NEPRA reserves decision on tariff increase under quarterly adjustments,"The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Monday reserved its decision on the government’s request to jack up electricity tariff for Karachi consumers by Rs6 per unit.
The regulator conducted a public hearing to consider the federal government’s request for tariff increase.
The government sought the tariff hike on account of two different quarterly adjustments. It also requested for making additional collection from the people of Karachi from April to June 2023.
During the hearing, Nepra officials said that the federal government had filed request for an increase in electricity prices on account of quarterly adjustments to maintain uniform tariff across the country.
They said that an additional collection of up to Rs4.45 per unit would be made from April to May 2023 while another extra collection of Rs1.55 per unit would be made from April to June 2023.
Owing to the increase in tariff, the consumers of K-Electric (KE) will bear an additional burden of Rs20 billion.
The government had submitted an instant motion, requesting the application of up to Rs4.45 per unit in the first quarter of financial year 2022-23 (July to September) and Rs1.55 per unit in the second quarter of 2021-22 (October to December), which were previously determined by the regulator for the ex-Wapda power distribution companies (DISCOs).
Average hike in tariff for KE consumers will be Rs3.21 per unit in the first quarter of FY23 and Rs1.55 per unit in the second quarter of FY22.
Nepra had previously approved a tariff hike of up to Rs4.45 per unit, allowing DISCOs to transfer an additional burden of Rs42 billion to the consumers on account of quarterly adjustment for the first quarter of current fiscal year. It directed that the additional burden would be transferred in February and March, which would have an average impact of Rs3.30 per unit. The decision will increase the per-unit cost for different categories of consumers in the range of Rs1.4874 to Rs4.45 per unit.
In accordance with the National Electricity Policy 2021, the government may maintain a uniform end-consumer tariff for KE and state-owned DISCOs (even after privatisation) by incorporating direct/ indirect subsidies.
Accordingly, the applicable uniform variable charge of KE is required to be modified in order to meet its revenue requirement, determined by the regulator and consistent with the national tariff of DISCOs.
Keeping that in view, the federal government filed an instant motion with respect to the end-consumer tariff recommendations of KE to maintain uniform tariff across the country. The move was also intended to synchronously recover the KE’s revenue requirement, determined by Nepra, while considering the proposed targeted subsidy and cross-subsidies.

8,Rs103b sanctioned for circular debt,The first tranche of additional power subsidies worth Rs335b agreed with IMF,"The government has sanctioned Rs103 billion in additional subsidies to reduce the power sector’s mounting circular debt amid disclosure from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif that the outstanding dues of Chinese power plants have surged to Rs450 billion.
The Ministry of Finance gave the subsidy to settle the claims of K-Electric (KE) and Azad Jammu and Kashmir. The Rs103 billion unbudgeted subsidy is the first tranche of additional power subsidies worth Rs335 billion that Islamabad had agreed to pay under an understanding with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in February, according to government sources.
At a time when the Power Division was in process of clearing additional subsidy claims, the PM revealed that the “outstanding dues of the Chinese power plants have increased to Rs450 billion”. The PM made the statement while addressing a meeting of the parliamentary party.
PM Sharif said that the Chinese dues had mounted to Rs450 billion despite his government paying Rs150 billion to the Chinese producers during the past one year.
In breach of its commitments under various agreements signed with the Chinese power producers, Pakistan has not been able to pay the cost of electricity in a timely manner due to the poor performance of the power sector and a shortage of foreign currency. The Chinese power plants are facing an acute shortage of raw material – primarily coal – required to run the plants and are so far showing restraint by not triggering dispute settlement mechanisms.
The huge outstanding dues on account of power purchases underscores the financial meltdown of the power sector due to fewer budgeted subsidies, higher line losses, low recovery of electricity bills and inefficiency of the public sector.
For the current fiscal year, the government had budgeted Rs570 billion in power subsidies, which after a recent understanding with the IMF, will now surge to a minimum of Rs905 billion.
An official from the finance ministry said that the funds will go to Central Power Purchase Agency-Guaranteed (CPPAG), which will settle payments with the IPPs as well. The money has been given as an advance subsidy, which will be adjusted against the claims filed by the energy ministry for the current fiscal year.
The reconciliation of power sector subsidies remains an issue, as the finance ministry officials said that despite repeated requests, and a decision made by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC), the Power Division is reluctant to provide year-wise details of the outstanding subsidy.
Of Rs103 billion, an amount of around Rs49 billion will be adjusted against the KE claims and the remaining Rs54 billion against the AJK claims.
A taskforce, constituted by the PM, to resolve issues related to KE was negotiating a package of documents to reach a sale purchase agreement, payment of tariff differential subsidies and resolution of other disputes.
Power sector losses are on the rise despite a significant increase in prices. In February, the government approved increasing electricity prices in the range of Rs3.3 to Rs15.52 per unit for residential consumers, farmers and exporters to recover an additional Rs237 billion in four months.
The revised circular debt management plan showed that despite a significant increase in prices, and an additional Rs335 billion subsidy, the circular debt stock will jump to Rs2.37 trillion by June this year.
Circular debt, that was earlier projected to come down to Rs2.1 trillion, will now grow to Rs2.374 trillion – an addition of Rs261 billion despite a massive surge in electricity prices.
The cabinet had also approved deferring the repayment of Rs283.3 billion in debt obtained for retiring the old circular debt for two years. The deferment, however, has put an additional burden of Rs3.23 per unit on electricity consumers on account of debt servicing costs on delayed payment.
Sources said that under the IMF-Pakistan understanding, an additional subsidy worth Rs115 billion will have to be paid in April. While the Power Division had requested the release of over Rs200 billion, the finance ministry agreed to only Rs103 billion.
The second tranche of Rs115 billion will be given to pick another KE subsidy worth Rs67 billion and Rs36 billion to settle the outstanding dues of exporters. The remaining Rs12 billion will be given to the Balochistan tube-well subsidy.
The last tranche of Rs120 billion will be released in June to settle the dues of the exporter’s subsidy, Kissan package, fuel cost adjustment, KE, AJK and Balochistan, according to the sources.
