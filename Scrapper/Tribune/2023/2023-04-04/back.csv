0,House of Sharif blasts SC for 'facilitating blue-eyed boy',"Nawaz Sharif rejects verdict, calls for filing reference against top court judges","The House of Sharif on Tuesday cast aspersions on the Supreme Court after it ordered provincial polls in a win for PTI chief Imran Khan despite the government’s reluctance to hold the votes, terming the “controversial bench” as former prime minister’s “facilitator”.
It called for a reference against the judges in the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) for a “partisan judgment to facilitate one person”.

PTI chief Imran Khan has been pushing for assembly elections in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as part of a campaign to force an early general election that he has waged since being forced from office a year ago after losing a vote of confidence.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has rejected Imran’s call for an early general election. His government had backed an election commission delay in the votes in the two provinces to October 8.
Talking to reports in London after the apex court declared the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) decision to postpone polls in Punjab till October 8 unconstitutional, PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif said the decision was the result of a ""one-man show.""
""Supreme Court judges have said that this is a one-man show,"" Nawaz said in reference to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial.
However, he cheered the dissenting judges' notes against the three-member bench hearing the election case as nothing less than an act of “Jihad”.

Referring to PTI chief Imran Khan, the PML-N chief wondered if everything could be destroyed just to facilitate one person. ""This is not a punishment for Nawaz Sharif, but for the people of Pakistan who are suffering and will suffer more due to the supreme court's decision,"" he warned.
He made it clear that his party will not accept the decision of three judges which was also rejected by other judges of the court.
""I have suffered imprisonment but the real punishment is being given to you through these decisions,"" he added.
Asked whether or not the PML-N was ready to sacrifice everything now that the party has decided to reject the court's decision, Nawaz said: ""I will tell my party not to accept this partisan decision come what may.""
‘Blue-eyed boy’
Separately, PML-N Maryam Nawaz also fumed at the apex court’s decision and took to her Twitter to say that the verdict was the last blow of the conspiracy which began by ""rewriting the Constitution and presenting the Punjab government on a plate"" to the bench’s blue-eyed boy.
The PML-N scion termed the three-member bench as ""Khan’s facilitators"" and said that this was done so he could be reselected under their presence and supervision.
“This bench has taken responsibility for the work done by [Lt Gen] Faiz [Hamid], [ex-CJP Asif Saeed] Khosa and Saqib Nisar in 2018. A majority of the Supreme Court revolted against this appalling and brazen facilitation and one-man show,” she said.
He pointed out that it was high time the parliament learnt to stop this facilitation using its “constitutional and legal hands”.
She further stated that it is not enough for the federal cabinet to reject the verdict, adding that those who tried to impose the “favourite” by defying the Constitution and law should be brought to the rostrum.

1,Constitutional crisis to lead to martial law: Bilawal,FM implores judges to take stock of current situation and form full court bench,"Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has sounded the alarm on the possibility of a constitutional crisis in Pakistan, with a foreboding warning that it could lead to martial law or an emergency-like situation.
His concerns stem from the ongoing case wherein the Supreme Court (SC) is hearing the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's (PTI) petition against the Election Commission of Pakistan's (ECP) decision to postpone the Punjab Assembly polls.
For the past week, a three-member bench comprising Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial, Justice Ijazul Ahsan, and Justice Munib Akhtar has been deliberating on the case.
The apex court has rejected the repeated requests from the coalition government for the formation of a full court bench. The court reserved its verdict in the case earlier on Monday.
Addressing the media in Larkana on Monday, FM Bilawal underlined that if a larger bench is not formed, it could culminate in a constitutional crisis and invite a potential martial law or an emergency-like situation in Pakistan.
He implored the judges to take stock of the current situation in the country and form a full court bench to address this pressing issue regarding the election date.
Bilawal underscored the criticality of institutions' conduct for the betterment of the nation. He highlighted that the impact of a decision made by three individuals would be dissimilar to that of a larger bench. Therefore, the apex court should contemplate the matter accordingly.
Further, the foreign minister chastised the higher judiciary from within its own ranks, denouncing it as “historic” indicating their no confidence in “these three judges”.
He questioned the decision to reduce a nine-member bench to a mere three after protests from its members.
He also criticised the inclusion of Justice Ahsan in the bench when he had previously distanced himself from the apex court's suo motu notice of the delay in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) elections’ proceedings in February.
Bilawal also took an aim at SC Registrar Ishrat Ali, alleging that he was a ""super emperor"" with the power to strike off the judgment of a three-member bench through a notification whenever he wanted.
The foreign minister exhorted the chief justice and the judges to form a larger bench before any further action is taken. He maintained that in such a scenario, the decision of all the judges would be acceptable to the coalition government.
The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman said that they would ""fight and contest"" if any court instructed them to use funds earmarked for flood affectees for the “battle of Lahore's throne”.

2,Govt trying to 'influence' SC decision,Opposition leader in Senate says govt attacking top court through parliament,"Opposition Leader in the Senate, Dr Shahzad Waseem, on Monday slammed the coalition government for trying to “influence the decision” of the Supreme Court that is set to seal the fate of Punjab Assembly elections.
He said the verdict will have a profound bearing on the country’s politics and alleged that the government was signalling its unwillingness to obey the apex court’s decision.
The Supreme Court will announce its verdict on the PTI’s petition challenging the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) decision to postpone polls to the Punjab Assembly till Oct 8 on Tuesday (today).
A three-member bench — comprising Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial, Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Munib Akhtar — reserved the judgment on Monday after hearing all the parties, including the government, the PTI, the ECP and others. However, the counsels of the coalition parties were not heard.
The senator said that if the government failed to abide by the decision of the Supreme Court, it would be guilty of contempt of court. “The entire nation's civil society stands with the top court,” he maintained.
“Actions are being taken beyond the constitution and there have been attacks on the judiciary in the past as well. Now they are attacking the Supreme Court through the parliament,” the opposition leader in the upper house said, about the government-introduced (Practice and Procedure) Bill 2023, which aims to curtail the suo motu powers of the office of the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP).
The new draft law, which has been sent to the president for assent, has cut down the chief justice's powers to constitute panels, hear appeals or assign cases to judges in his team, according to a copy of the bill.
Lashing out at the government for inflation and economic woes, Waseem said there was a crisis of flour in the country, “earlier people used to eat bread, now bread is eating people”.
The government is afraid of the election, the rulers are afraid, whereas the people and Imran Khan are standing on one side, he added.
Earlier, Senate Chairman Muhammad Sadiq Sanjrani referred three bills to relevant standing committees of the upper house.
One bill, the Toshakhana (Maintenance, Administration and Regulation) Bill, 2023, moved by Senator Mushtaq Ahmed, aims to provide for the maintenance, administration, and regulation of Toshakhana.
Another bill, The National Commission on the Rights of Child (Amendment) Bill, 2023, moved by Prof Dr Mehr Taj Roghani, seeks to amend the National Commission on the Rights of Child Act, 2017.
The third bill referred by the Chairman, The Export Processing Zones Authority (Amendment) Bill, 2023, was moved by Senators Faisal Saleem Rehman, Bilawar Khan, Manzoor Ahmed, and Hidayatyllah.
The bill aims to introduce amendments to the Export Processing Zones Authority Ordinance, of 1980.

3,"Nawaz, Zardari have wealth but no respect: Imran",Says ennobling and honouring anyone is only in the hands of Almighty,"Ridiculing the heads of PML-N and PPP, PTI chief Imran Khan on Saturday said that both Nawaz Sharif and Asif Zardari only had money but no respect, adding that ennobling and honouring anyone was only in the hands of Almighty.
Addressing an iftar dinner with party workers at his Zaman Park residence, the PTI chairman noted that the PML-N supremo “only had money but no respect”.
“He (Nawaz) cannot come out on streets. He is abused everyday while sitting in the most expensive area of London,” he said.
Imran said Zardari and Nawaz would have been “more respectful” if any wealthy person had the authority to “buy admiration” by spending money.
“Ennobling and honouring anyone is only in the hands of Almighty.”
Meanwhile, British Acting High Commissioner to Pakistan Andrew Dalgleish called on the PTI chief at his residence in Lahore.
The British envoy discussed matters related to bilateral relations and mutual interest with him.
During the meeting, Imran shared his party's vision about strengthening democracy, rule of law and supremacy of the Constitution.
He highlighted the ongoing “human rights violations” in the country and discussed the concerns raised by the international community in this regard.
He underscored that the supremacy of rule of law was one of the main political agendas of his party, stressing that democracy was based on the “foundations of human rights”.
Imran maintained that PTI believed in strengthening democracy by finding solutions to the public issues through vote.
The Constitution of Pakistan decides timelines of free and fair elections in the country but the incumbent rulers are trying to find an escape from polls through gross human rights violations from the right of self-dignity and freedom of expression, he said.

4,Third generation of Bhutto family awaits SC justice: Bilawal,PPP chairman says Zulfikar’s ‘judicial murder’ black spot on justice system,"Foreign Minister and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has termed the “judicial murder of first elected prime minister of Pakistan Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto” as a black spot on the justice system of the country, saying that now the third generation of the Bhutto family is awaiting justice from the Supreme Court.
In his message issued from the Bilawal House Media Cell on 44th martyrdom day anniversary of Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the PPP chairman said that the presidential reference regarding the judicial murder of the prime minister who gave the country a unanimous Constitution had been pending in the Supreme Court for the past 12 years.
“During these 4,382 days, our justice system did not have even a minute to listen to Bhutto Shaheed's plea. How many more generations of the Bhutto family will have to wait to get justice?"" he asked.
Bilawal said that history had brought so many proofs in favour of Bhutto's innocence that even his worst enemies now had to say that the “Quaid-e-Awam” suffered gravest injustice.
""I appeal to the Supreme Court that the presidential reference sent by (former) president Asif Ali Zardari under Article 186 on April 2, 2011 should be fixed for early hearing.""
Paying glowing tribute to the “Quaid-e-Awam”, Bilawal said that under the prudent leadership of Bhutto, Pakistan crossed many milestones in political, diplomatic, economic, defense and social terms.
""Raising the political consciousness among the people, giving the country's first unanimous Constitution, making agricultural and economic reforms, starting the nuclear programme, establishing Pakistan-China friendship and making Pakistan the diplomatic capital of the Islamic world are a few examples of Bhutto Shaheed’s achievements,"" he pointed out.
He said that the occasion of Bhutto's martyrdom anniversary was a day for renewal of pledge that the PPP would continue upholding and would not give up at any cost the democracy, the Constitution of 1973, the parliamentary supremacy, rights of workers, farmers, minorities and women, as well as tolerance and equality in the society.
""Bhuttoism will continue to remain the beacon of light to guide us, and we will continue to struggle to provide 'Roti, Kapra Aur Makan' (bread, cloth and home) to every Pakistani by establishing a strong democratic system based on justice and fairness,"" he pledged.
