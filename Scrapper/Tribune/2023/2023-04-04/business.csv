1,Senate passes bill on Balochistan institute,Proposed institute will be the first private-sector higher education institution in the province,"The Senate has unanimously passed the Pakistan Institute of Research and Registration of Quality Assurance Bill, 2023, which aims to regulate its faculties, staff, and students by providing an enabling environment and infrastructure to help them develop their potential for scholarship, creative work, professional realization, and service.
The proposed institute will be the first private-sector higher education institution in Balochistan province, and a federal charter is being sought for its establishment.
The resolution for the institute's establishment was passed by the Provincial Assembly of Balochistan on October 27, 2022. Since the province does not have a provincial commission of higher education and is still following the federal Higher Education Commission (HEC), a federal charter is being sought for the institute.
This move is expected to provide a much-needed boost to the education sector in Balochistan and help students achieve their full potential.

3,K-P district hospitals ill-equipped,Influx of treatment seekers being redirected to the provincial capital for basic tests,"While the former provincial government claims that significant improvements have been made in district hospitals across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), a large influx of patients forced to travel to Peshawar for treatment, unravels a starkly different reality.
According to sources privy to the matter, a majority of the District Headquarter Hospitals (DHQs) and Basic Health Units (BHUs) located in various small towns in K-P, direly lack both the necessary medical facilities and the personnel crucial to the provision of healthcare services to the area’s population. Consequently, the populace of these towns has to turn instead to hospitals in the provincial capital.
“I have travelled five hours with my elderly father to seek treatment at the Khyber Teaching Hospital since the DHQ and BHU in our locality lack even the most basic medical and diagnostic facilities,” lamented Arshad Hussain, who had undertaken the nearly four hour journey from Kurram to Peshawar.
The Express Tribune also learnt that the unavailability and non-functionality of essential radiology machinery like the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computerised Axial Tomography (CAT) scan and ultrasound, is a major reason behind a large number of patients from remote areas travelling to Peshawar’s hospitals for diagnosis and treatment.
Furthermore, sources also revealed that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government had in the past initiated a public private partnership by signing a Memorandum of Understanding with private companies, allowing them to install their diagnostic machinery in the district hospitals - however, much of this machinery has now become obsolete since very few maintenance checks were performed to sustain their proper functionality.
Resentful of having to travel long hours to get simple diagnostic tests performed, many citizens poured their hearts out while speaking to The Express Tribune. One such citizen was Najib Ullah Khan, a local from Upper Dir, who had travelled six long hours to chaperone his elder brother for his treatment at the Lady Reading Hospital in Peshawar.
“The government makes big promises of upgrading medical facilities and increasing the number of doctors in district hospitals just to garner votes in elections. If real improvement had been made in our district healthcare system, we would not be travelling half a day just to get a simple diagnosis,” resented Khan.
Agreeing with Khan, an official at the provincial Health Department confirmed, under the condition of anonymity, the deplorable state of affairs in the district hospitals; adding that the difference between the PTI government’s claims of improvement in healthcare during the election campaign and the on-ground reality in the following months, was huge.
When asked about the paucity of medical facilities facing the populace of far flung areas, Advisor on Health to the caretaker Chief Minister of K-P, Dr Abid Jameel, replied: “We are carrying an official inquiry to unravel any corruption in the government bodies which would have allowed such a gap to arise between the former government’s healthcare agendas and outcomes. Simultaneously, we are also working towards upgrading the medical facilities in smaller districts so that the burden on Peshawar’s hospitals may be relieved.”

4,PHC seeks reply over certificates law tweak,Accused given time to reply in harassment case,"The Peshawar High Court (PHC) has issued notices to the parties on the writ filed against the initiative of obtaining the birth, marriage, and death certificates of the Local Government Department after one year through the court and has issued orders to file a reply within 14 days.
The bench consisting of Justice Shakeel Ahmed and Justice Arshad Ali started hearing the writ of Muhammad Faheem on Monday.
His lawyer Shah Faisal Ilyas told the court that in 2013 the Local Government Act was passed in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), in which it is clear that birth, marriage, and death certificates will be issued by the Municipal Department and the record will be kept with them.
Recently, the Local Government Department has amended the Act to state that the said certificates will be obtained within 90 days, and after the expiry of this period, it will be necessary to approach the court and get a court order for the said certificates.
He said that this process of the public facility has been made very complicated which will affect millions of citizens while it is also against the Local Government Act.
He also said that with this initiative, apart from losing the health facility card, the citizens will also face difficulties in getting admission for children and inheritance.
Secretary local government, NADRA, and other relevant authorities have been made parties in the writ, who have been issued notices and asked to respond.
Harassment case
Separately, the PHC has given more time to the opposing side to file their reply in the case of harassment of a female student in Islamia College Peshawar.
The court has given them a last chance and ordered them to file their reply by April 6.
A bench comprising Justice Shakeel Ahmed and Justice Syed Arshad Ali of the high court heard the petition of the victim student.
During the hearing, the lawyer of the professor named in the harassment case requested the court to give them more time to submit the answer.
He told the court that another case is also connected with this case.
The petitioner, who was a lawyer in this case, has now become a government lawyer, he added.
Meanwhile, Sangin Khan, the petitioner’s wife’s lawyer, told the court that the petitioner’s lawyer had done that case in the public interest and their case is that of the victim student.
After the incident of harassment, the victim student is not going to the university which is ruining her time because the professor who was allegedly named in the harassment case is now the chairman of the department, the lawyer added.
He requested to hear the case soon.
The court adjourned the hearing till April 6, giving a deadline to submit the reply in the harassment case.
