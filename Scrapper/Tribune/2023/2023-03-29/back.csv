0,Sana’s non-bailable arrest warrants cancelled,Hearing adjourned until April 28 after Sana appears before court,"The Gujrat anti-terrorism court on Tuesday cancelled the non-bailable arrest warrants of Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah in a terrorism case lodged against him at the Industrial Area police station in 2022.
The police had registered a terrorism case against Sanaullah on Aug 25, 2022 on the complaint of Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid leader Shaikh Shahkaz Aslam for allegedly threatening the judiciary and government officials in his speeches delivered on April 12, 2021 and Jan 29, 2022.
The police had quashed the case, submitting a report to the court which was later annulled by the ATC, followed by the issuance of arrest warrants, which were turned into non-bailable arrest warrants when Sanaullah did not attend the hearing on March 7.
Judge Rana Zahid heard the case in which Sanaullah and his legal team were present.
The interior minister said, “I could not come to the court at the previous hearing as I was engaged in government-related work.”
The judge cancelled the non-bailable arrest warrants, ordering the interior minister to furnish a surety bond of Rs500,00. The judge adjourned the hearing till April 28.

1,No extension in Hajj applications date: ministry,Spokesperson urges intending pilgrims to submit dues in time,"The Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony on Tuesday ruled out the possibility of last date extension in Hajj applications.
Spokesperson Muhammad Umar Butt, talking to APP, urged the intending pilgrims to submit their Hajj applications and dues in time.
Giving a break-up of the Hajj applications, he informed that the ministry had received 44,621 Hajj applications through designated banks so far. He said it had received 40,313 applications under the Government Hajj Scheme while 4,308 applications under Sponsorship Hajj Scheme.
He said the designated banks remained open across the country for the collection of Hajj applications and dues to facilitate the intending pilgrims on the weekend.
On Saturday, the ministry scored a total of 4,468 Hajj applications of which 3,960 were received under the Government Hajj Scheme and 508 under the Sponsorship Hajj Scheme, he said, adding that on Sunday the ministry collected a total of 2,679 Hajj applications of which 2,371 applications were received under Government Hajj Scheme while 308 under Sponsorship Hajj Scheme.
Butt said Meezan Bank had topped the list by collecting 9,142 Hajj applications, including 940 under Sponsorship Hajj Scheme, to date.
He said the overseas Pakistanis could submit a health certificate issued from abroad in the bank or they could furnish a medical fitness certificate before their Hajj flight.
He said those who had not yet received the coronavirus vaccine, could also submit the application.
“However, they will have a full dose of the vaccine and submit the certificate to the banks before their departure to Saudi Arabia. Apart from NADRA (National Database and Registration Authority), a foreign vaccine certificate will also be acceptable,” he maintained.
He clarified that it was not necessary for the person sending sponsorship to have a blood relation with the pilgrim. But it was essential to send the name, Computerised National Identity Card number, and contact number of the pilgrim along with the money, he added.
According to other official sources in the ministry, a reduction of Rs45,000 was expected in the Hajj expenses under the Government Hajj Scheme. If the Pakistani currency did not fall further, the benefit would be transferred to pilgrims by the ministry, they added.
They said the ministry was trying to make the Hajj package cheaper as the negotiation with the Saudi government was under way.
They said after the reduction, the Government Hajj Scheme for the northern region would be from Rs1,175,000 to Rs1,130,000 while it would be from Rs1,1 65,000 to Rs1,120,000 for the southern region.

2,Free wheat flour: protests erupt in K-P,Police say they can’t control protests erupting every day as complaints of unavailability pile up,"Protests and brawls for the supply of free government wheat flour on Tuesday were witnessed at various places in Peshawar as the city’s police expressed their helplessness to control the situation and asked the provincial government to avail the services of the Frontier Constabulary for this purpose.
Protests broke out in different parts of the city including Ashraf Road, Khyber Colony, Yousufabad, Ittehad Colony, Zaryab Colony, Faqirabad, Ring Road, and Badhber.
Protesters blocked Kohat Road over not receiving the free flour, resulting in a massive traffic gridlock in the area.
In Hayatabad, protesters blocked Masjid-e-Zarghoni Road over the same issue.
Protesters also blocked a road in Zaryab Colony.
The protesters complained that they had to wait in long queues for the entire day and still return home empty-handed.
They claimed that flour was being distributed on the basis of nepotism, with political affiliation taken into account.
Complaints of not receiving the free government flour are increasing with each passing day.
The city's police have advised the provincial government to use the FC to keep the law and order situation under control during the process of free flour distribution.
Police officials said they had hardly come up with the manpower for the ongoing census in the city.
Apart from that, they also have to deploy police personnel for the security of bazaars and mosques during the holy month of Ramazan.
They said across the province, its southern districts in particular, a large number of women gather at the distribution points to collect free flour, making it difficult for the police to manage the situation.
The police officials said the provincial government could identify the distribution points where the problems were being faced and deploy FC personnel there as an additional force.
The provincial government would consult with the Centre to make the final decision on the deployment of the FC personnel.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, while recently chairing a review meeting in Islamabad, said free flour would be provided to the underprivileged people of Punjab in the first phase under the special Ramazan package.
Later it was decided to include the deserving people of Islamabad in the scheme.
Similarly, other provincial governments also announced plans to distribute free flour bags.
However, unorganised distributions in parts of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa resulted in stampedes.
A man was killed in Charsadda, and several others were injured in Swabi and Kohat. Another man in Bannu died after the boundary wall of a flour mill collapsed ahead of the distribution process.
In the Hasilpur tehsil of southern Punjab, at least five women were injured in a stampede at a free flour distribution point.

3,HRCP rebukes feuding political parties,"Chairperson says crux of ongoing crisis is political, not legal","The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan on Tuesday rebuked feuding political parties for undermining democracy as the world's fifth-most populous country battles an economic crisis.
The fragile coalition government led by Shehbaz Sharif has been facing increasing pressure from opposition leader Imran Khan, Pakistan's most popular politician, ahead of elections.
There have been multiple clashes between the police and the PTI chairman’s supporters this month over legal cases the former cricket star has decried as spurious.
""We are aware that there is a very menacing and irresponsible opposition here which has made use of violence, humiliated police, and destroyed the law and order,"" HRCP Chairperson Hina Jilani told a news conference in Lahore.
""Despite that, we are forced to say that we do not expect such behaviour by the state and government which includes retaliatory measures, vindictive, and vengeful measures.""
Imran dissolved the two provincial assemblies he controlled at the start of the year in a bid to disrupt Shehbaz’s government.
Under the Constitution, elections must be held within 90 days, a deadline which lapsed. However, the Election Commission of Pakistan refused to set a date within the constitutional time period after the military said it was unable to ensure security.
The date of the elections were now tied up in legal wrangling.
""The dissolution of the assemblies were a very dangerous and incorrect political strategy in my view, and there was an agenda behind it,"" Jilani said of Imran's move.
""Despite that, we believe regular elections in Pakistan are extremely important.""
Imran sent his MPs back to the upper house on Tuesday, nearly a year after he was ousted in a no-confidence vote and ordered his allies to abandon parliament.
He has since been snarled in dozens of legal cases, including for sedition and under Pakistan's anti-terrorism act.
Imran's supporters clashed with the police outside his Lahore home this month when officers arrived with an arrest warrant that was later suspended.
""Ultimately, the crux of the ongoing crisis is political and not legal,"" Jilani, a Supreme Court lawyer, said in a statement.
""There is no other option for the political opposition and the government but to hold serious and meaningful dialogue in parliament to resolve this in the larger interests of Pakistan's people.""
Pakistan is also in the grip of a dire balance-of-payments crisis that has forced the government to implement strict financial measures in a bid to revive a stalled International Monetary Foundation bailout programme.
The measures have seen the rupee plummet and inflation soar and the crisis has left families struggling to afford basic food items and fuel.
In some extreme cases, parents have pulled children out of school and sent them to work.
The caretaker governments, which are severely limited in their day-to-day operations, are in place in the two dissolved parliaments of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab.

4,Non-bailable arrest warrant issued for Imran,"Court rejects PTI chief's request for absence, issues orders to ensure attendance on April 18","A District and Sessions Court of Islamabad has once again issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for the April 18 hearing, while rejecting Imran’s request for an exemption from appearance of the case pertaining to intimidation of a female judge.
Imran has challenged the decision to issue a warrant, and the appeal will be heard in the session court on Thursday.
While arguing before the court, the lawyer said that Imran’s life is in danger.
Prosecutor Raja Rizwan Abbasi opposed the petition filed for exemption from Imran’s appearance in the court and argued that since the former premier is absent, the bailable warrant should be changed to a non-bailable warrant.
The prosecutor opposed the “excuse” of the Wazirabad attack.
The prosecutor further said in the court that Imran’s medical report was not submitted.
No concrete reasons were given for non-attendance, he said, adding that Imran’s request for exemption from attendance is not signed by him but only by his lawyers.
During the hearing, the prosecutor requested to dismiss the request for exemption from attendance and said that a non-bailable arrest warrant should be issued for him.
After hearing the arguments of the lawyers and the prosecutor, the judge reserved the decision on Imran’s request for an exception, which was then released after a while.
The court rejected Imran’s request for an exception and issued a non-bailable arrest warrant while ordering him to appear in court on April 18.
Separately, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) has directed an investigation into the cases registered against Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan under terrorism provisions.
The court has instructed the police to conduct an inquiry into the matter.
The court, in its order to grant interim bail till April 6 on a bond of Rs50,000, has said that Imran should appear at every hearing till the decision on the bail application.
IHC Chief Justice Aamir Farooq and Justice Mian Gul Hasan Aurangzeb have issued a written order to grant interim bail to the PTI chief in seven cases registered under terrorism provisions for stone pelting, vandalism, arson, and injuring of police personnel outside the Judicial Complex.
In a written order, the court said that Imran should appear before the court at every hearing and be interrogated by the police till the decision on the bail application. The court said that as and when required, the former prime minister should join the investigation.
The court also issued a notice to the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Law and Justice, seeking a report over the withdrawal of security from the former prime minister.

5,President questions timing of judicial reforms,Alvi says the use of force can give rise to issues,"President Dr Arif Alvi on Wednesday stressed that he had always played a role for the resolution of national issues and was now ready to make such efforts with a 'crises resolution role' in the current situation.
In an interview with private news channel, the president, to a query regarding approval of the judicial reforms bill, replied that it could have been tabled in the Parliament at an appropriate time, considering the ongoing situation.
He said he had heard different analysis, opinions and discussions related to the judicial reforms and opined that it might be addressed after taking the judiciary into confidence as well. Responding to another question, he expressed that he would take the right decision over the said bill after receiving the final document.
The president observed that the use of force could give rise to issues and in democratic countries, issues were being addressed through the development of consensus.
He said the pressure on institutions led to cracks and stressed that the Constitution should not be disfigured.
The president regretted that in the past, the 1973 Constitution was wrapped after four years of its enforcement. He hoped that in the current situation, division of thinking was apparent whether it was within the political parties, parliament or judiciary and underlined that they all should strive to save Pakistan and the Constitution.
Regarding a question about the Election Commission of Pakistan's decision to set a new date for polls in Punjab, the president said the Supreme Court was seized of the issue and it would decide it.
But after listening and reading media reports, he wondered if the holding of the election depended upon the issues. The nation wanted a responsible outcome, he added.
The president, to a query, replied that if polls were not held within 90 days, the institutions concerned should accept the responsibility for the delay. In the tussle between the democratic forces, there might be opportunities for the undemocratic forces, he added.
About the prime minister's letter in response to his earlier letter, the president maintained that due to the responsibility of his office, he could not remain 'deaf and dumb' regarding the recent human rights incidents as highlighted by the media.
He said during the tenure of the previous Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government, he had talked to the then minister for human rights over such issues as he could not ignore them. The minister agreed that the rights issue during 2021 was not good and it grew in the succeeding year.
The president to another question said the difference of opinion in the judiciary was possible as witnessed in the United States and the United Kingdom, but he stressed, personality-based differences were not good.
Talking about his audio leak, he trashed it as irrelevant and said he had been advocating for respecting people's privacy and encroaching on individuals' privacy as unethical, immoral and illegal as it fell into 'Gheebat'.
The president said the polarization in society was too dangerous and he wanted to reduce it. Referring to his past role in diffusing political tensions, the president said he could not succeed in his efforts.
President Alvi said the present chief of army staff's statement regarding the military's role provided a window for the politicians to work collectively for the democratic system.
Expressing his concerns, the president said the federal and provincial governments could not announce awards for any individual under relevant constitutional provisions, as it was a prerogative of the president. He said he had raised the issue during the PTI's tenure. Citing the unanimous adoption of the 1973 Constitution, the president said it reflected the “brilliance of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto”.
To a comment, he agreed that the disqualification of politicians or political parties was no solution to the issues. He said he always credited former president Asif Ali Zardari for raising the slogan of 'Pakistan Khappay' after the assassination of Benazir Bhutto as nothing could save the country from another serious crisis at that time. He further observed that the lives of all politicians were precious and they should be provided protection.

6,Non-payment of salary triggers protest by PR staff,"PREM Union president said workers are forced to fast without Sehr, Iftar","The employees of Pakistan Railways continued their protest for the second consecutive day on Tuesday against non-payment of their salaries.
A large number of protesters gathered at the PR diesel engine shed in Lahore.
The employees demanded immediate payment of their salaries
The BC and class IV employees of railways had not yet received their salaries.
On the call of Pakistan Railways Employees (PREM) Union, workers protested at the diesel engine shed, washing line, railways headquarters and division offices across the country.
The diesel engine shed employees stopped the engines, protesting in large numbers.
The protesters chanted slogans against the railways administration and the Ministry of Railways.
“Every time when the payment of our salaries is delayed, we suffering economic crisis,” the protestors said. “Children's fees, electricity bills and other matters are also stuck.”
The employees expressed their intention to further expand the scope of protest against non-payment of salaries.
On Monday, the railways workers staged protests at the diesel engine shed and Lahore station over non-payment of their salaries.
Two separate protests against non-payment of salaries were organised by the PREM Union.
The PREM officials strongly condemned the attitude of the railways administration.
PREM Union Divisional President Fayyaz Ahmed Shehzad said, “During Ramazan, the stoves of the railways workers are cold and they are forced to fast without Sehr and Iftar.”

7,Bilawal seeks trial of PTI leaders,"FM accuses Alvi, Imran of violating Constitution’","Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has demanded that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif should prosecute former prime minister Imran Khan, Qasim Khan Suri and President Arif Alvi for allegedly violating the Constitution.
Bilawal, while speaking in the National Assembly (NA), said that Pakistan has seen a democratic constitutional crisis and faced dictators. “Pakistan is facing historical inflation and economic crisis; the increasing pressure on the world economy during the Russia-Ukraine war and coronavirus pandemic is not in our hands,” he added.
He also said that the terrorists “played Holi” with the blood of the Pakistani nation for years and the former prime minister pardoned the terrorists and brought them back to resettle them.
“There is no example in the world of tribal people's competition with terrorists,” he added.
The foreign minister said that undemocratic things were done in response to every constitutional initiative, and the constitution was broken in response to democratic distrust. “We continued to do politics of the nobles, but this cannot happen with the Constitution,” he said, adding that people must be told why they are suffering from a crisis.
He also said that the former army chief used to interfere in politics in the past, and the children of a dictator cannot have a political future. “What is the reason that the children of all the dictators are in Tehreek-e-Insaaf today?” he asked.
The foreign minister said that in 1996, General Hameed Gul held the finger, while the role of General Pasha, General Zaheerul Islam, and General Faiz Hameed is in front of everyone. “Dictatorship in the Supreme Court (SC) was started by Iftikhar Chaudhry, and he was also a part of this hybrid war, his aim was the end of the Constitution; General Faiz and General Pasha are gone but Imran remains,” he added.
Bilawal said that a chief justice like Chaudhry has passed in the past, and one needs to think about who was responsible for the crisis in the country.
“General Pasha, General Islam, and General Faiz are all remembered. In our institutions, Einsteins sit and create plans and strategic assets,” he added.
The foreign minister said that they have been talking about the supremacy of the Constitution and free media, but undemocratic steps were taken in response to their democratic step.
He said that they did not do anything undemocratic by expelling an “undemocratic prime minister” and it is not appropriate to remain silent for the sake of democracy.
“The nation must be told why such situations have happened,” he added.
He further said that in response to the no-confidence motion, the then-prime minister, the-then speaker of the lower house, and the current president of the country “broke the Constitution”. “What did Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif do in response to this? If the constitution and law have been broken, file a case,” he demanded.
The foreign minister said that an organisation was involved in the conspiracy against the two prime ministers but now it has been decided that they will respond with this legislation.
“We were blackmailed in the process of bringing in the 19th Amendment,” he added.
Regarding the current political situation, he pointed towards existing polarisation. “When this fight is finally over, we have to sit together again and sit with those we do not like,” he added.

8,PTI to raise ‘political victimisation’ issue globally,Mazari says document chronicles ‘human rights violations’ of PTI supporters from April to March,"The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Tuesday announced it would raise the issue of cases filed against its leadership and the arrests of workers at the international level.
Speaking at a news conference, senior PTI leader Dr Shireen Mazari said that the party had prepared a document chronicling the “human rights violations” of the PTI supporters from April 10, 2022 to March 21, 2023.
“These documents consist of three parts,” Mazari told the reporters. “The first section mentions the ‘political exploitation’ of the PTI and its allies, including the Zaman Park [Lahore] operation,” she added.
“Apart from this, the attitude of the government towards the opponents and the murderous attack on Imran Khan and political restrictions are mentioned. The document also mentions the cases registered against the PTI chairman and the party leadership.”
In the second part, the former human rights minister said, the cases of curbs on freedom of expression and silencing of journalists had been highlighted, besides the mentioning of targeting of opponents through the media.
“In the third part, we have also included the issue of audio and video leaks. Because the question arises as to who recorded the telephone line of the prime minister and what were the motives behind it while it is a clear violation of the law,” she continued.
Mazari said that the document also contained the constitutional clauses so that the world “can know how the government is violating” the country's laws as well as the human and fundamental rights.

“Under Article 13 [of the Constitution], no case can be filed twice but the government is using this as a strategy against us. We have mentioned the violations of the seven [international] human rights conventions, to which Pakistan was a signatory.
Mazari charged that “now our social media workers” were also being targeted. She pointed out that party activist Azhar Mashwani had gone missing for five days, but “no one is accepting the responsibility or claiming his arrest”.
On the occasion, senior PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry highlighted the arrest of PTI supporter Hassaan Niazi. Hassaan, he said was a barrister and “it would have been better if he had stayed out”, he said. “Do the Pakistanis have no rights?”
He told reporters that 15 first information reports (FIRs) were registered against the PTI chairman in a single day, while 1,060 party supporters were arrested till March 21. “We are compiling the list of 1,100 more arrests.”
