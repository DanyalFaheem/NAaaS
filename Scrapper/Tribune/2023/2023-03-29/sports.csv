0,MQM-P rejects digital census results,Says unbelievable that population of rural Sindh is rising and Karachi’s declining,"Muttahida Qaumi Movement Pakistan (MQM-P) has rejected the results of the digital census announced so far by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics and demanded re-conduct of the exercise and access of people to the dashboard of the statistics department.
MQM-P Senior Deputy Convener Dr Farooq Sattar while addressing a press conference at the party’s temporary headquarters in Bahadurabad said the party will hold protest if their concerns regarding the digital census were not allayed.
The head of Pakistan Bureau of Statistics has released the data related to the census which was unacceptable to MQM-P, Sattar said adding, data shows that the population of rural Sindh has increased while the population of urban Sindh, especially Karachi, has decreased. “This process clearly shows that our concerns were valid.”
The MQM-P leader said the plan is to show Karachi’s population as low as twenty million. The Sindh government was afraid that if the population of Karachi was counted correctly, the next chief minister would be from the party winning from Karachi.
To avoid this situation, the ruling party of the province, was rigging the census through its enumerators and civil servants, Sattar said.
He further said that so far more than 500 complaints have been received from different districts of the city regarding the census.
“According to our information, the PPP-led Sindh government has been given access to the PBS dashboard,” he said adding that MQM-P has reports that PPP was pressurising the statistics department to show population of rural Sindh as high as possible and Karachi as low as possible.
“We demand that if the Sindh government can be given access to the data, MQM-P and all the people of Pakistan should also be given access to the PBS dashboard,” he said.
The statistics agency should make the data of the dashboard public so that every individual can see his own count through mobile phones.
He said there were reports from the residents of various localities that enumerators go to one house and leave four houses. No one knows whether data entry was being done in the tab of the enumerators or not.
Sattar blamed the provincial government for colluding with the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) to illegally occupy a cosmopolitan city like Karachi in the census and is committing abuses by not registering more than half of the population of Sindh in the census. Census is the issue of our survival.
He said that MQM-P would hold peaceful protest and also knock at the doors of the judiciary and state institutions on the matter of fidgeting census figures.
He said with MQM-P’s demands not accepted, remaining in the government or supporting it has become questionable. “We are placing our concerns before the chief of army staff, the chief justice of Pakistan and prime minister through today’s press conference,” Sattar said.
For the last five days, ‘Mardam Shumari Hamari Redline’ has been a top trend on social media. We appreciate the social media team of MQM-P and the citizens of Karachi for raising their voice on social media.
Rabita committee members Zahid Mansoori, Syed Hafeezuddin and others were also present on this occasion.

3,Plea challenges acquittal in Baldia factory fire case,SHC issues notice over death sentences to two in same case,"The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Tuesday issued notices to the special public prosecutor on an appeal against the acquittal of four accused in the Baldia factory fire case. 
A two-member SHC bench, headed by Justice KK Agha, also issued notices over the death sentence awarded to two accused, Abdur Rehman alias Bhola and Muhammad Zubair alias Chariya.
On September 11, 2012, more than 260 workers were burnt alive in the multi-storey building of the Ali Enterprises garment factory in Baldia Town in what was one of the worst industrial disasters in the country's history. Later it turned out that the fire was in fact an arson attack by extortionists who had been demanding protection money from the owners. 
Appearing before the SHC bench, the lawyer of the convicts, Sarmad Khan Advocate, presented a list of 400 witnesses, including 347 public and private witnesses, before the bench. He argued that it was necessary to cross-examine the statements of another 53 witnesses related to the case. The judges remarked that they were under the impression that the case would be disposed of soon but it was getting confusing instead. They ordered that the final list of witnesses should be prepared in consultation with the prosecutor. Justice KK Agha asked where were the accused who had been acquitted. 
Their counsel, Hassan Saber Advocate, said that they were present in court and he would plead on their behalf.

5,Colleges hope of KU affiliation in doldrums,"Missing teachers, lack of books and facilities plague institutes seeking BS programme recognition","After the Sindh High Court’s orders in the matter pertaining to the University of Karachi (KU) granting affiliation to various government colleges in the metropolis, a committee was formed to explore the prospect. It has revealed that education on offer at these colleges to be subpar. 
The committee had to submit recommendations on granting affiliation to colleges wishing to start a BS programme. It includes principals of six government colleges and was formed by the Department of College Education last month. 
Sources privy to what took place during the proceedings of the committee informed The Express Tribune that the committee had met two times so far and the disclosures made in the meetings vis-à-vis the state of colleges were shocking to say the least.
The Express Tribune learnt that in the second meeting of the committee, which was chaired by the Director General (DG) Colleges Professor Shadab Hussain, the committee was apprised of staff shortages, lack of books, and lack of computer and science labs in the colleges seeking affiliation. 
Furthermore, Professor Hussain was informed that granting affiliate status to colleges, which did not even have teachers for many subjects, would put a question mark on the process.
The DG was briefed about the fact that many of the government colleges had not been allowed to buy books from the open market by the College Education Department for the past four years. That had instead been directed to buy books from the National Book Foundation. 
However, the foundation did not have the relevant books and the books that were available were of poor quality. Hence, the DG was told that if the foundation could not supply books at the intermediate level, the committee’s members did not have faith that it would be able to fulfil the demand of colleges once they had a BS programme.
Furthermore, the issue of lack of computer and science laboratories and missing computers and lab equipment was also discussed in the committee.
The Express Tribune contacted the director, Professor Hussain, to inquire about the damning revelations made in the committee. He confirmed that they were true. 
When quizzed about the department’s inattention to the state of colleges, Professor Hussain said that they were going to address them. “The Sindh Public Service Commission had placed a hiring freeze on teachers. When the older teachers retired, a shortage emerged,” the DG explained, adding that the department was hoping that the commission would now allow recruitment. 
“As far as the purchase of books is concerned, we are going to send a summary to the secretary of the College Education Department and request that colleges be allowed to purchase books from the open market,” said Professor Hussain.
However, in his interview with The Express Tribune, the DG neither gave any timeline on when the process would be completed nor did he talk about what would transpire in the affiliation process.

6,Inflation dampens Eid shopping,Sale of ready-made garments rise as tailoring cost goes up,"As usual, Eid shopping has started in the metropolitan city as markets and shopping plazas begin to witness an unusual rush. However, this time the neck-breaking inflation has been weighing down on shoppers, making it hard for the common man to afford what he could afford on Eid in the past.
They say that Eid is incomplete without new clothes. But the prices have increased exorbitantly this time around, reveals a survey conducted by The Express Tribune. 
The price of men's unstitched fabric has gone up by Rs50 to Rs100 per meter on average as compared to the last year. 
Similarly, an average cotton suit, which was available for Rs1,000 last year, is now selling at Rs1,400. The price of an average wash-and-wear shalwar-qameez has increased to Rs1,200 from last year's Rs900 and Rs1,000. However, fabric imported from China is comparatively cheaper in Bara markets of the city.
This year, new varieties of cotton fabric, such as Shimre Cotton, Paper Cotton, Malai Cotton, and Cotton Lawn, have also been introduced in the markets. 
Since imported fabric is expensive, people are increasingly opting for locally spun clothes. According to shopkeepers, ready-made garments are becoming unaffordable for the common man which is the reason they prefer to buy unstitched fabric. The products of local textile mills, especially Shabbir, Gul Ahmed, Star, Lakhani and Dawood, are in high demand. 
The main cloth markets are situated in Saddar, Tariq Road, Haidari Market, and Bara markets in Nazimabad, Qasbah, Lasbela, Saddar and Defence. The cloth sales centres set up in different parts of the city wear a deserted look during the day, but they witness an influx of customers after Iftar and Taraweeh. 
These cloth centres extend their business hours until Sehri in the second ten days of Ramazan when the sales pick up. Chawla Market in Nazimabad is particularly popular among shoppers due to its family-friendly environment. 
According to shopkeepers, mostly cotton and cotton lawn for kurtas are being sold due to hot weather, while the sale of imported cotton has also increased, which is soft and suitable for summer.
Traders say that rising street crimes have also affected their sales as they deter shoppers from coming to markets. People prefer to shop in the crowded markets that is badly affecting sales in smaller markets in the city and its suburbs. 
Shopkeepers have reported a significant decrease in the sale of wash-and-wear and fancy clothes due to heat. Chicken and lawn are also bought for kurtas. 
Besides local brands, fabric imported from South Korea, Indonesia, and China are also available in the markets.
Apart from that, textile mills in Karachi have also set up fair price shops on their premises which are mostly located in the SITE and industrial areas. At these shops, fabric is available at a price 10 to 15 per cent lower than the market price. For this reason, these shops are crowded with customers during their business hours.

7,JI will not let poll rigging succeed through recounting,Accuses PPP of planning to abandon LG setup once again,"Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) Karachi Ameer Hafiz Naeem-ur-Rehman has accused the Pakistan People Party (PPP) of planning to abandon the local government setup once again. 
He emphasised that the JI will not let such plans succeed and will safeguard every vote cast in its favour. 
Speaking at a press conference held at the party’s Karachi headquarters, Rehman said that the JI would not tolerate rigging in the name of recounting. He accused the PPP and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) of fraudulently taking over JI’s union councils as recounting was carried out despite broken seals and torn bags. 
He welcomed the Islamabad High Court’s decision to issue a stay order against the recount in Karachi and announced that he would personally appear before the court in Wednesday’s hearing.
He said that JI had emerged as “the single largest party in Karachi in terms of popular votes, wards, and union councils”, and said that it showed the city had reposed its trust in the party.
He said that the PPP didn’t want election on the remaining 11 union councils as it didn’t want to be part of the LG process. He also demanded that the authorities hold the elections on the scheduled date of April 18. 
Rehman also criticised the ECP, saying it was playing the role of PPP’s facilitator. He alleged that the ECP had taken up the cases of six union councils in Karachi and had ordered a recount of controversial ballot papers under the supervision of already biased returning officers and district returning officers. 
He also demanded that the ECP take the ballot papers in its custody from the returning officers (ROs) and the district returning officers (DROs) to ensure transparency.
Rehman also demanded that the government and relevant authorities bring transparency to the process of census enumeration.
