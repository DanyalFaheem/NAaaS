0,Rupee stabilises against dollar at 283.55,Dollar demand stands low due to no major import payment,"Pakistani rupee continued to stabilise around current levels on Tuesday as it inched up 0.01%, or Rs0.03, and closed at Rs283.55 against the US dollar in inter-bank market.
The rupee managed to inch up owing to low demand for dollar amid critically low foreign exchange reserves of the country at $4.6 billion.
The currency has continued to move in a range of Rs281-284/$ for the past three weeks, according to the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) data.
Market talk suggests the rupee-dollar exchange rate remained largely stable throughout the day, as there was no major import payment pressure.
Experts said that the demand for dollar dropped partly in the wake of withdrawal of the condition of 100% advance payment for imports with effect from March 31, 2023.
Moreover, supply of the US greenback remained comparatively better as overseas Pakistanis were sending higher remittances to their family members back home to help them cope with the soaring inflation.
On Monday, the rupee dropped slightly by 0.13%, or Rs0.38, and closed at Rs283.58 to a dollar.
The rupee saw the second largest drop of Rs19 in a day to an all-time low at Rs285.09/$ in the first week of February, after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expressed concern for the second time that the government was controlling the rupee’s movement.

1,PTV strikes deal without board’s nod,"Management defends decision, saying tendering complied with public procurement rules","The management of Pakistan Television Corporation (PTV) entered into a multibillion-rupee agreement with a private firm for the digital streaming of content without seeking approval of its board in violation of corporate governance rules of public sector companies.
Details showed that PTV signed the deal in October last year with Z2C Pakistan Private Limited. Sources told The Express Tribune that the board questioned the management in its last meeting about bypassing it in reaching the deal that carried financial implications for the entity.
It may also expose the deal to legal scrutiny, although the party had been shortlisted after following the competitive process.
The one-year agreement can be renewed after expiry with mutual consultation and then can automatically be renewed yearly for three successive years. The management has bound the state-run entity into a potentially five-year deal without final nod of the board, showed the details.
The agreement has become effective for over-the-top (OTT) media service but the service has not yet been officially launched, according to the sources. The OTT agreement was signed for the provision of video-on-demand and streaming of current and achieved content.
When contacted, the PTV management defended the decision of avoiding the board scrutiny of the deal. “The agreement was made after open prequalification and financial bidding process, pre-audit and legal vetting of the case by PTV audit and legal department,” said PTV Managing Director Sohail Ali Khan.
He added that a high-level committee of PTV directors and senior officials had been formed to oversee and complete the whole process.
“The tendering was done as per PPRA rules, so no exemption and approval were required from BOD,” said the MD. He added that a complete digital strategy along with concepts including digitisation of archival content and its monetisation on digital platforms had already been discussed and endorsed by the PTV board.
But bypassing the board in such a big financial matter was a violation of the Public Sector Companies (Corporate Governance) Rules 2013.
The rules make it mandatory for all public sector companies to place key information before their boards for discussion and approval.
Rule 7 states “significant issues shall be placed before the Board for its information and consideration, to formalise and strengthen the corporate decision-making process.”
Rule 7 (d), which is directly relevant to the PTV deal, states “details of joint ventures or collaboration agreements or agreements with distributors, agents” will be placed before the boards for approval.
Rule 7 (i) states that inter-corporate investments in and loans to or from associated concerns in which the business group, of which the public sector company is a part, has significant interest have also to be placed before the boards.
According to the PTV deal, Z2C will share 10% of the revenue with PTV during the first year, which will increase to 15% during the second year and from the third year the ratio will rise to 20%.
The second bidder, Convex Interactive Private Limited, had offered a 40% revenue share to PTV for the first two years and 60% for the next three years.
However, Convex’s revenue forecast for the next five years was low, which led to low minimum guaranteed revenue. It caused Convex to lose the bid on financial score despite beating Z2C in technical score. The combined score of Z2C was higher than Convex’s score.
But PTV may sustain a potential loss if actual revenues increase more than the projection of Z2C due to its far higher share.
To a question, the PTV MD said “although Convex offered attractive revenue-sharing percentages, their minimum guaranteed amounts were much lower than those offered by Z2C for five years.”
Convex’s minimum guaranteed revenue was less than half of what Z2C offered.
The PTV management said that being a newly launched platform, it would initially require two to three years to stabilise the position and then could generate handsome revenues. Therefore, “a more realistic revenue share accompanied by a minimum guaranteed amount is considered to be better,” said the MD.
He said that PTV being the owner of the platform would only be the provider of the content. Moreover, all the content and platform are owned by PTV.

2,Meta to lower bonuses for employees: WSJ,Bonus slashed to 65% from 85% with promises to assess staff performance,"Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc is planning to lower bonus pays for some employees, and assess staff performance more frequently, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, citing an internal memo.
Employees of the social media giant, who get a rating of “met most expectations” in their 2023 year-end reviews, will receive a smaller percentage of bonus and restricted stock award due in March 2024, the WSJ report said.
The bonus multiplier for that grade has been cut to 65% from 85% earlier, WSJ said, adding that the company will also restart assessing staff performance twice a year.
“We are making changes to our performance process, taking into account learnings and feedback over the last year while optimising for the future. These changes are not related to workforce restructuring,” a Meta spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters, without giving any further details.
On March 14, the company announced that it would cut 10,000 jobs this year in a second round of layoffs, as part of restructuring that will see it scrap hiring plans for 5,000 openings, kill off lower-priority projects and “flatten” layers of middle management, as the industry braces for a deep economic downturn.

3,‘Water efficiency is a necessity’,"Experts say agriculture sector uses over 90% fresh water, but wastes 50%","Pakistan is experiencing frequent and severe climate change-induced natural disasters. The country has a long history of battling droughts and floods. Despite contributing less than 1% of global carbon emissions, the country is still grappling with the effects of climate change.
Agriculture is the largest consumer of freshwater in Pakistan, using over 90% of the resource, but mismanagement has led to almost 50% of water being wasted.
While there may be little the country can do, relative to advanced economies, to mitigate the chances of such calamities increasing, it can progress by leaps and bounds by adopting water resource management strategies from these progressive countries. The unavailability of sufficient usable water resources can lead to food security issues in an agriculture-based economy with a burgeoning population.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Concave Agri Services President, Muhammad Ali Iqbal said, “Pakistan is losing its two biggest water reservoirs: glaciers and underground water.” With “mind boggling” usage of water by the sector, it is key to launch an awareness campaign to ensure that farmers use water resources appropriately.
“Due to outdated farming techniques, irrigation is still done using the older flood irrigation technique – wasting more than 50% of water resources,” he said, adding that drip irrigation, sprinklers, and other smarter technologies can help the farming community use water more efficiently.
Iqbal emphasised that smarter technologies, like drip irrigation and sprinklers, can help the farming community, especially in Sindh and K-P, to make use of this precious resource judiciously. Digital solutions can also be introduced to monitor water usage, as in other countries, instead of using decades-old manual irrigation methods. Moreover, it is becoming evident that the over-usage of water for irrigation purposes not only makes the water table go down but also causes serious damage to soil health, affecting the productivity of the agriculture sector.
According to Mahmood Nawaz Shah, Senior Vice President Sindh Abadghar Board (SAB), some of the 50% lost water is natural, while some is not accounted for as it is used illegally.
Pakistan’s multinationals are helping conserve water by improving water use efficiency in their direct agricultural supply chain.
Nestlé Pakistan launched its Water Pledge in 2021, which focuses on agriculture, factories, and communities, and aims to improve water use efficiency in its direct agricultural supply chain. Through this initiative, around 205 acres of land was covered, starting from districts around Sheikhupura and Kabirwala, while sensors were installed on another 455 acres, resulting in an estimated savings of a cumulative 368,000 cubic meters of water in 2021.
“In addition to these numbers, in 2023, we plan to expand drip irrigation to up to 100 acres of land, working with farmers in Sindh for the first time,” said Rahat Hussain, Spokesperson for Nestlé Pakistan.
Nestlé has partnered with the Government of Punjab and LUMS to install drip irrigation mechanisms and Smart Soil Moisture Sensors respectively, over hundreds of acres of farmlands in Punjab. The partnership aims to expand drip irrigation to 100 acres of land in Sindh in 2023. These sensors send moisture content reports to a digital cloud, enabling operators to know which locations require irrigation, allowing not only optimum levels of irrigation but also of crop yield.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Agri Tourism Development Corporation of Pakistan Director of Information, Khawaja Mazhar raised concerns over the increasing contamination of fresh water due to sewerage water. He suggested that water highways and cemented channels must be built to avoid water seepage during the course. He also called for the adoption of water efficient crops such as beetroot instead of sugar cane and rice.
Mazhar emphasised the need for awareness to manage domestic water usage to tackle the water crisis. He stated, “In our cities, fresh water is contaminated by the sewerage water that is also considered lost water.”
Several corporations have already taken steps to tackle the issue of water usage, with Unilever’s Water Stewardship project being a prime example. The project has successfully cut water usage by 49%, and the company has also committed to launching sustainability programs in the 100 most vulnerable locations worldwide, including Pakistan.
Despite the alarming water crisis in the country, the private sector’s efforts have created a ray of hope that technological advancements will enable Pakistan to become an efficient user of its watershed and avoid destruction.

4,Digital banks eye Pakistan’s unbanked population,"Country hosts third largest unbanked adult population globally, with over 100 million unbanked","Despite a general wait-and-see approach by global investors in Pakistan, digital banks are quietly moving ahead with plans to tap the country’s vast unbanked population.
In January 2023, Pakistan’s central bank approved five global and local financial institutions to establish full-fledged digital banks. With over 220 million people, Pakistan has the third largest unbanked adult population globally with about 100 million adults without a bank account.
United Arab Emirates (UAE)-based Mashreq Global Network-Pakistan Head, Sharmeen Niaz highlighted the significant potential for digital banking in Pakistan: “I believe, Pakistan’s banking sector is brimming with huge potential and is on the cusp of massive transformation. The move towards digital banking driven by technology, data and analytics is transforming Pakistan’s banking industry into an always-on one, offering customers 24/7 on-demand services, and convenience.”
With a smartphone penetration rate of 82%, Pakistan is becoming a mobile-first economy. In addition, the country has been recognised as an attractive global innovation hub, according to the UN’s Global Innovation Index. The supportive regulatory environment, including for digital bank licensing, digital onboarding of customers, and RAAST etc., is also encouraging innovation.
Mashreq Bank is one of the five financial institutions to receive a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to establish a digital bank. Niaz emphasised that the bank is investing in Pakistan to bolster the economy, and the NOC for digital banking will further contribute to the transformation of the country’s banking sector. The other four banks to have received NOCs include Easy Paisa DB, Hugo Bank, KT Bank and Raqami.
“Mashreq has been quietly investing in the country with Mashreq Global Network (MGN), channelising efforts to help bolster the economy…With the acquisition of NOC for digital banking, we will be further contributing to Pakistan’s banking sector and its transformation,” added Niaz.
In addition to offering convenience for customers, digital banking also enables a distributed workforce model, as demonstrated by MGN’s 100% work-from-anywhere model. “Presently, all our employees are operating under a 100% work-from-anywhere model,” she said. The bank has over 1,800 employees across India, Pakistan, and Egypt, with more than 250 professionals based in Pakistan. In total, the bank’s workforce includes 40% women.
“With over 61 million internet users, and robust payments and security infrastructure already in place, it is easy to operate digitally in the country. This coupled with our robust technology infrastructure and distributed workforce module, has enabled us to offer flexibility of working and collaborating from anywhere with our global teams,” she said.

5,‘AIIB has increased aid to Pakistan’,Lender’s president says more investment needed amid higher uncertainty,"Asian Infrastructure Development Bank (AIIB) President Jin Liqun said that the bank has increased its multilateral assistance to countries including Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
“While liquidity continues to tighten, we need to help those countries that are insolvent. AIIB stands ready to support the world’s most vulnerable countries, and we have increased our multilateral assistance to countries including Pakistan and Sri Lanka. In addition, we are considering post-earthquake support for Turkey,” he said during the China Development Forum (CDF) 2023, adding that the international community is confronted with multiple risks and challenges.
Prolonged high inflation, tight labour markets, and spill-over effects from high commodity prices are likely to keep central banks tightening their monetary policy all over the world, China Economic Net (CEN) reported on Tuesday. “At a time of higher debt levels, the situation may be even more troubling for some developing countries and low-income countries with high levels of debt.”
For those developing countries, higher uncertainty means a change in investors’ risk tolerance. Liqun believes that amid such pessimism, more investment is needed, especially in infrastructure.
“The development bank will continue to firmly support developing economies in building conditions for long-term economic growth,” the AIIB president said, adding that there was a need to reform the governance system, so that developing countries can be more involved and reach more consensus under the multilateral framework.

6,Tobacco farmers warn against FED hike,Say move will give rise to illegal players,"Tobacco farmers from economically marginalised areas of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) have expressed their concern over the recent increase in federal excise duty (FED) on cigarettes. They have warned that the move will reduce economic prospects for tobacco farmers, increase poverty and unemployment, and may even encourage some farmers to turn to anti-national elements, thereby threatening the integrity of the country.
At a press conference attended by tobacco farmers from Mardan and Swabi districts of K-P, the farmers highlighted the social and economic impacts of the FED increase on the tobacco industry. They pointed out that tobacco is an important cash crop and any threat to this crop is a threat to the survival of tobacco farmers, which could cause serious socio-economic consequences.
The transfer of a large portion of the tobacco crop from the legal industry to illegal players would reduce economic prospects and result in inordinate delays in payments, affect cash flow, and unemployment. Only two tobacco companies, with a market share of around 60%, contribute 98% of the tobacco tax collection, whereas all other tobacco companies operating locally contribute only 2% to the national exchequer despite having a market share of about 40%. More than 90 tobacco companies default on taxes, causing a loss to the national exchequer.
The farmers suggested that the government should crack-down against companies and brands selling illegal cigarettes and bring them under the tax ambit. 
It is worth mentioning that the government collected Rs153 billion in taxes from two companies in 21-22 while a target of Rs200 billion was set for 22-23 that was further revised to Rs315 billion, slapping the legal tobacco industry with additional taxes of more than 150%.

7,OGDCL’s receivables swell to Rs1tr,"Oil, gas producing company in financial trouble as major customers default","The country’s largest state-run hydrocarbon producer, Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL), has started feeling the pinch of the ballooning circular debt as its customers have defaulted on payment of around Rs1 trillion.
Total receivables of OGDCL, which plays a critical role in gas supply across the country, have now mounted to Rs968.2 billion. The company’s clients have failed to make timely payments, which can impact its future plans for oil and gas search in the country.
In the meantime, state-run Pakistan LNG Limited (PLL) could not secure additional liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply contracts to meet domestic needs as the global market is encountering shortage of gas in the wake of Russia-Ukraine war.
So, the only hope is to push the domestic oil and gas producers to expedite hydrocarbon exploration across the country to quell the growing consumer appetite.
In a relevant initiative, the government has planned to renew the exploration licences of companies that had defaulted or whose licences had been revoked due to litigation with the government.
The objective of the plan is to encourage the discovery of more gas reserves to boost supplies at a time when LNG has gone scarce in the international market.
Even if LNG is made available, Pakistan does not have enough foreign currency reserves to pay for imports, say energy experts.
In such a situation when the government is keen to look for more hydrocarbon deposits, the trapping of the country’s largest oil and gas explorer in circular debt has come as a setback.
Moreover, state-run companies cannot operate on commercial terms and are compelled to supply gas to even those state utilities that do not pay bills due to political interference.
Sources told The Express Tribune that the public gas utilities, refineries and power companies were the key defaulters of OGDCL that could not clear their bills.
OGDCL had to receive Rs647.9 billion from different clients on account of gas supply. Of the total, its receivables from Sui Southern Gas Company Limited (SSGCL) stand at Rs282.4 billion and from Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) Rs239.2 billion.
It is worth noting that OGDCL produces gas at different fields and provides it to SSGCL and SNGPL. In turn, the two gas utilities supply gas to consumers in different categories which comprise domestic users, commercial units and power plants.
Furthermore, some power plants receive gas directly from OGDCL’s fields for electricity production.
Among the power plants, Uch Power Limited (UPL) has to pay OGDCL Rs71.8 billion, Uch-11 Rs54.17 billion, Engro Rs263 million and Fauji Kabirwala Power Company Limited (FKPCL) Rs23 million.
OGDCL also produces crude oil and supplies it to local refineries for processing and production of petroleum products. These refineries have to pay a total amount of Rs61.8 billion for crude oil consumption.
Among the refineries, Attock Refinery Limited (ARL) is a major defaulter with outstanding dues of Rs29.15 billion. Similarly, National Refinery Limited (NRL) has to pay Rs7.5 billion, Pakistan Refinery Limited (PRL) Rs7.5 billion, Parco Rs6.8 billion, Enar Rs5.8 billion and Byco Rs4.8 billion.
In addition to the gas utilities, power plants and refineries, OGDCL has to receive Rs24.7 billion from Uch Lease and Rs2.2 billion on account of gas infrastructure development cess (GIDC).
Besides, the company will get Rs230 billion on account of Term Financing Certificates (TFCs) parked in Power Holding Private Limited (PHPL). Earlier, the government issued TFCs against the reserves of OGDCL to reduce the circular debt.

8,PYMA protests 400% hike in tariffs,"Terms the new gas and electricity rate anti-business, anti-industry","The Pakistan Yarn Merchants Association (PYMA) has raised alarm over the recent hike in electricity and gas tariffs and is urging the government to reverse them immediately, warning of catastrophic consequences for industries and domestic exports.
“This huge electricity and gas tariff hike is an anti-business and ant-industry initiative,” said Sohail Nisar, Senior Vice Chairman of PYMA. He has appealed to the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Federal Minister of Energy Power Division Engineer Khurram Dastgir Khan to take action and reduce the cost of doing business in the country.
Muhammad Jawed Bilwani, Coordinator of the Value-Added Textile Forum, believes that the export sector, particularly the value-added textile sector in Pakistan, is on the verge of collapse due to the government’s neglect of the economy. He blamed the government’s anti-business and anti-export mind-set for the country’s current economic turmoil.
The industry is facing closure due to an extreme liquidity crunch and stuck sales tax refund claims worth billions of rupees, leading many industrialists to plan to shift their industries abroad. Unavailability of gas, lack of uninterrupted electricity supply, shortage of industrial inputs or raw materials, and excessive delays in refunds to exporters are also adding to the sector’s woes.
Approximately 60% of exporters’ liquidity is stuck as the government has stopped all sales tax refund claims, said Bilwani. He urged the government to take immediate action to save the export industries, which holds more than 60% share of the national exports.
Instead of making electricity and gas more expensive, the government should reduce tariffs to pull down the cost of doing business, according to Nisar. “The continuous rupee depreciation and rising dollar rates have already created difficulties for the importers of raw material,” he added.
“The increase of over 400% in electricity and gas tariffs will take the cost of doing business to an unbearable extent, resulting in disastrous effects on the industries and domestic exports,” he warned.
Pakistan’s textile exports for February 2023 were valued at $1.18 billion, indicating an 11% decrease on a month-on-month (MoM) basis, as per the latest data available. However, in Pakistani rupees terms, exports increased by 2% MoM to Rs315 billion.
According to Textile Analyst at Topline Research Nasheed Malik, value-added textile exports dropped by 13% MoM, primarily due to declining demand for readymade garments and knitwear. Towels and bed-wear exports also fell by 8% and 7% MoM, respectively. “The decline in demand for textiles is a global issue, with Bangladesh, China, and Vietnam also experiencing a decrease in textile exports,” explained Malik. Comparatively, Pakistan’s textile exports in February 2022 were down by 30% year-on-year (YoY).
