0,Imran eyes clear majority in polls,PTI chief says ‘fresh election’ only agenda of negotiations,"Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan on Wednesday said he was “hopeful” to win a clear majority in upcoming elections – that too without any “crutches”.
PTI sources disclosed that a delegation of around 300 members including retired session judges called on Imran Khan at his Zaman Park residence and expressed solidarity with the former prime minister.
PTI chief Imran sought their advice on legal reforms, saying: “We have to think how we can provide justice and sense of security to the common citizen. We will work on the reforms’ agenda after coming into power again”.
He said his party was never shy of dialogue and deliberations but the announcement of the fresh election would be “the only agenda of these negotiations”.
PTI senior leader Babar Awan said President Arif Alvi could either return the unconstitutional piece of legislation to parliament or send a reference to the Supreme Court (SC) for validation.
Speaking to the media after meeting with the PTI chief, Babar Awan said 13 ‘zahreeli jari bootian’ (deadly herbs) and 22 ‘lotas’ (turncoats) had drafted an unconstitutional piece of legislation to clip the powers of the top judge.

Deadly herbs and turncoats, he said, had been gathered in the “non-representative” National Assembly. The PTI leader said that if they [the government] tried to make any unconstitutional law, it could be turned down by the president as he had the power to ask the apex court for its opinion and endorsement.
The president also had an option to convey that subordinate legislation could not amend the constitution, he said, adding that Articles 238 and 239 were clear that it was a constitutional amendment.
Citing an example, Awan pointed out that once former military dictator Zia ul Haq’s name was included in the constitution which took several years to be erased.
“My experience says that there is not a long way in return of Imran Khan and change in Pakistan,” he said, highlighting that 43 cases were registered against Imran Khan just in Islamabad.
“Around 400 PTI workers have been arrested on terrorism charges. The government is left with no legal or moral authority to govern if 400 terrorists were in the federal capital,” he concluded.

1,EU eases financing curbs on Pakistan,Exit from 'list of High-Risk Third Countries’ reduces trade obstacles for Pakistani exporters,"The European Union (EU) has removed Pakistan from its list of 'High-Risk Third Countries' for anti-money laundering and terrorist financing purposes, according to the Ministry of Commerce, the commerce ministry announced on Wednesday.
“In line with the last year’s FATF decision, the EU has decided to remove Pakistan from its list of countries with high risk regarding money laundering and financing of terrorism,” the bloc said on Twitter.
An important positive step for 🇵🇰!👏
In line with last year's FATF decision,the 🇪🇺 EU has decided to remove 🇵🇰 from its list of countries with high risk regarding money laundering & financing of terrorism.@RKionka @HinaRKhar @BBhuttoZardari https://t.co/RIXpTtRfam
The EU High Risk Third Countries list is a list of countries that the union considers to have strategic deficiencies in their anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing frameworks.
In a statement, the Ministry of Commerce stated that Pakistan was added to the EU’s list in October 2018, which imposed undue regulatory burdens on “Obligated Entities” within the Union and created obstacles in legal and financial transactions with individuals and entities based in Pakistan.

It added that EU member states’ “Obligated Entities” will no longer be required to apply “Enhanced Customer Due Diligence” while conducting transactions with individuals and legal entities established in Pakistan.
The entities include credit institutions, financial institutions, auditors, external accountants, tax advisors, notaries, independent legal professionals (acting on behalf of and for their client in any financial or real estate transaction), estate agents and individuals trading in goods.
De-listing of Pakistan from EU's updated list of high-risk third-countries is a major development which will facilitate our businesses, individuals & entities. It is a reflection of our unwavering resolve to further strengthen anti-money laundering & anti-terror financing regime.
The EU Commission is mandated to identify high-risk third countries having strategic deficiencies in their regime on anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT).
Commerce Minister Syed Naveed Qamar in a statement said that EU authorities have removed Pakistan from the list.
Sir
EU has removed Pakistan from the List of High Risk Third Countries. Pakistani businesses and individuals would no longer be subjected to ‘Enhanced Customer Due Diligence’ by European legal and economic operators.
""Pakistani businesses and individuals would no longer be subjected to ‘Enhanced Customer Due Diligence’ by European legal and economic operators,"" he added.
The news was also confirmed by Senator Sherry Rehman in a tweet who credited Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto with the achievement.
Good news: the EU has removed Pakistan from its list of high-risk countries. Trade will now face less obstacles for Pakistani exporters, thanks to the efforts of the Foreign Minister @BBhuttoZardari
""Trade will now face fewer obstacles for Pakistani exporters, thanks to the efforts of FM Bilawal,"" she said.

The developments come as a much-needed breather when Pakistan faces the worst economic crisis in decades.
Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal had previously stressed that “Pakistan desperately needs to take measures to bring the country’s economy out of crisis through sustainable export-led economic growth”.
The economy continues to remain under pressure as still-incomplete talks for the ninth review between Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the revival of the loan programme -- which began on January 31 and had to be finished on February 9 -- are yet to conclude.

2,Senior judges’ divergent views expose tensions,Justice Isa questions top judge’s authority to make special benches,"The country’s top court has held that all cases that various Supreme Court benches are hearing under Article 184(3) of the Constitution be postponed until amendments are made in the Supreme Court Rules, 1980, regarding the discretionary powers of the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP).
A three-judge special bench of the Supreme Court issued the order on Wednesday with a vote of 2 to 1, while hearing a suo motu case related to grant of 20 additional marks to a Hafiz-e-Quran student seeking admission to MBBS or BDS programmes.
The special bench, formed by CJP Umar Ata Bandial, was presided over by Justice Qazi Faez Isa. Justice Aminuddin Khan and Justice Shahid Waheed were also part of the bench.
Read: Justice Isa questions provisions of 'special bench' constitution
The ruling came as the National Assembly on Wednesday unanimously passed the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure), Bill 2023, curbing the CJP’s suo motu powers.
Authoring the majority judgement, Justice Isa noted that neither the Constitution nor the Supreme Court rules give the CJP the power to make special benches or decide as to which judge will be on a certain bench.


""The rules do not grant any power to [the SC] registrar or to the chief justice to change a judge or judges on a bench or to reduce their number,"" the order stated. Justice Aminuddin Khan also endorsed Justice Isa's views. However, Justice Shahid Waheed dissented from the order.
The order noted that three categories of cases fall under Article 184(3) of the Constitution,
""Firstly, when a formal application seeking enforcement of fundamental rights is filed. Secondly, when (suo motu) notice is taken by the Supreme Court or its judges. And, thirdly cases of immense constitutional importance and significance (which may also be those in the first and second category).
“Order XXV of the [SC] rules only attends to the first category of cases. There is no procedure prescribed for the second and third category of cases.” The order noted that it is a serious matter as no appeal can be filed against a verdict issued in suo motu cases.
""The rules also do not provide how to attend to the following matters: (a) how such cases be listed for hearing, (b) how bench/benches to hear such cases be constituted and (c) how judges hearing them are selected.""
The majority order also said that the top court rules also do not tell as to how cases be listed for hearing, how bench/benches to hear such cases be constituted and how judges hearing them are selected.
During earlier proceedings of the case, Justice Isa had questioned whether the SC rules allow formation of special benches in the first place.

""Where is the concept of the special bench,"" he had asked, adding: “They (the three) judges were sitting in different benches in the morning"".
He said the constitution of special benches would create ""misgivings"" and open the apex court to ""criticism"". Appearing before the court, Attorney General for Pakistan Shehzad Ata Elahi has said that there were precedents for special benches. He had sought time from the court to assist it on the matter.
Justice Isa also wondered why the matter of granting 20 additional marks to Hafiz students was listed before a bench after 14 months. Expressing his deep concerns, the senior judge said that the SC ""is a completely unaccountable institution"" and that therefore ""we must proceed with utmost caution"".
""What is the due process,"" Justice Isa asked, ""if one case is listed for hearing the very next day after being filed while another is listed after a delay of several months?""
The SC judge also expressed reservations over the ban on criticising state institutions – in particular the conduct of superior courts – by the country's media regulatory body, the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra).
""Why should my conduct not be discussed if I do something wrong?"" he said. ""Does Pemra want to create a police state?"" He also asked what the term “state institutions” even meant.
""The Federal Shariat Court could even declare the Pemra orders as unIslamic,"" he remarked.
Winds of change?
After issuance of recent cause lists, legal experts have begun debating as to whether winds of change have finally started blowing in the apex court as earlier questions were being raised about not including two senior most judges – Justice Isa and Justice Sardar Tariq Masood – in special or larger benches hearing constitutional and politically sensitive cases.
There is a strong perception that some particular judges were being preferred for most of the politically sensitive matters for the last five years, while others are not – a matter made further controversial by Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah's remarks in another case.

3,Bill on CJ’s suo motu powers sails through NA,Top judge will be barred from suo motu notice in an individual capacity,"The National Assembly on Wednesday unanimously passed the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure), Bill 2023 -- aimed at curbing the top judge’s suo moto powers in an individual capacity.
The House also passed the Lawyers Welfare and Protection Bill, 2023 and the session was adjourned till 12 noon on Thursday (today).
A day earlier, the federal government not only ruled that the chief justice of Pakistan could no longer constitute benches and initiate suo motu proceedings alone but also tabled the same bill in the lower house of parliament to curtail the unbridled powers of the top judge for approval.
Subsequently, NA Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf while referring to the order of the day noted that though the bill related to CJP’s powers had to be passed on Tuesday, the sense of the House suggested that it should be referred to the law and justice committee for further deliberation.
As the NA session began on Wednesday, Speaker Ashraf presided over the session wherein the standing committee’s report on the Supreme Court Practice and Procedure Bill was presented in the House by PML-N MNA Bashir Mehmood Virk.
North Waziristan MNA Mohsin Dawar presented the amendment to the bill that was supported by Federal Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, who had tabled it in the House.
Dawar noted that Karachi's Nasla Tower was demolished because of a suo moto notice, suggesting that the victims of Article 184(3) of the Constitution in the past should be given the right to appeal within 30 days.
The PPP supported Dawar’s amendment, after which it was approved.
Earlier, the Standing Committee on Law and Justice unanimously approved the amendments proposed by the federal cabinet.
The bill suggested that a committee comprising three senior-most judges of the apex court would decide on the suo motu notice, while there would be a right to file an appeal within 30 days of the suo motu decision.
The appeal has to be fixed for hearing within 14 days of filing and after the taking of a suo motu notice, the hearing will be conducted by a three-judge bench, the bill added.
It continued that the decision of the majority in the matter would be acceptable to all.
After the passage of the law, no decision of the SC or high court, or any other legislation would be able to affect it.
Under the additional amendments, the right of appeal would be available in pending cases, while the bench constituted on constitutional as well as legal matters would comprise at least five judges.
Speaking on his bill, Tarar said it was presented in the NA on Tuesday with the aim of making judicial proceedings transparent.
He pointed out that not having the right to appeal in Article 184(3) was against the basic principles of the Constitution and there was no immediate hearing on cases of urgent nature.
He maintained that the rampant use of Article 184(3) started from 2008 to 2010 when a former chief justice started taking suo motu notices.
He added that there should not be a “one-man show” in a suo motu case hearing.
Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, who is also the PPP chairman, while addressing the law minister, described the move as “too little and too late”.
He added that it should be called a “judges empowerment” bill.
Tarar acknowledged Bilawal’s “too little, too late” remarks, but said he believed that there was a right time for everything.
“The government demonstrated restraint until a voice came from within the courts,” he added.
The law minister, in response to an issue raised by some circles within the legal fraternity, claimed that there was no need for a constitutional amendment.
“They should go and read the Constitution's Article 191, which empowers parliament to legislate. The Supreme Court also made their rules according to the Constitution and law since 1980 and it is written on the preamble as well,” he added.
He said the country had six bar councils and maintained that all of them saluted the tabling of the bill.
“This bill was a long-standing demand of the bar councils, which said that indiscriminate use of 184(3) should be stopped,” he added.
Speaking in the House after the tabling of the bill, Leader of the Opposition Raja Riaz observed that it would provide justice to the common person, end the one-man show and strengthen the judiciary.
He added that the government and the opposition had jointly brought the bill. He continued that the opposition had considered the bill in detail.
Federal Climate Change Minister Senator Sherry Rehman said the bill was about dividing the powers of individual judges among senior ones.
“The dissenting voice of judges in the courts is in front of everyone,” she added.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that the government had fulfilled all the essentials of legislation and it needed to display its constitutional as well as legal powers.
He continued that the law should have been passed “long ago”.
Jamaat-e-Islami MNA Abdul Akbar Chitrali said Pakistan was facing many problems, emphasising on the importance of strengthening state institutions.
“The Supreme Court or the other [components of the] judiciary are not performing their duties. The judges of the Supreme Court have been taking ‘wrongful’ suo moto notices,” he claimed.
Expressing his views, PTI MNA Saleh Muhammad said the legislation was tantamount to imposing restrictions on an independent judiciary.
“Instead of passing the bill hastily, time should have been given for discussion,” he opined.

4,Maryam Nawaz aims guns at superior judiciary again,Cautions CJ against following Imran Khan’s lead,"Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Senior Vice President Maryam Nawaz has cautioned Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial against following Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan’s lead, claiming that the PTI chief humiliates his “facilitators” after using them.
“I want to give a message to Imran Khan’s facilitators: this is the judiciary of Pakistan, not your joyland where you issue orders to please your families,” she said while addressing a workers’ convention in Kasur on Wednesday.
Maryam, who has been indirectly accusing the chief justice for the past several weeks of forming benches comprising partisan judges in political cases and also other judges of “questionable integrity”, upped the ante, by naming and cautioning the top judge against aiding Imran.
The PML-N leader claimed that the day the SC announced a verdict against PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif in the Panama Papers case, the families of then-chief justice Saqib Nisar and senior judge Asif Saeed Khosa sat in the gallery to celebrate the decision.
She alleged that the CJP took suo motu notice on orders of the former prime minister, who, she claimed, is a “mad man”.
Maryam said Imran has not only “drowned” himself but also his benefactors. She said the former premier’s government was declared by the Supreme Court to have violated the Constitution, but despite that Imran was allowed to get off scot-free.
The PML-N leader asked CJP Bandial why Imran was not punished in that case.
She said people are forced to say that courts issue orders not in the light of the law and the Constitution but to facilitate Imran Khan; “decisions are taken to please wives, kids and sons-in-law”.
Maryam said the CJP said that the government has money for laptop schemes but does not have Rs20 billion for elections in Punjab.
She said that they have Rs20 billion for elections in Pakistan one time, not thrice. She reiterated that there was no guarantee that the PTI would accept the outcome of these elections, and upon losing it might accuse the PML-N-led federal government of meddling in the process.
She  said this was no child’s play.
“The CJ said that people are standing in lines for flour. We say that there are even longer queues outside courts of people awaiting justice,” she added.
Maryam said they are democratic people and want elections but before elections the question of how Hamza Sharif’s government was overthrown by “gifting” 25 votes to the PTI must be answered.
She said that the question of who changed the decision from four to three majority to two to three minority decision in the provincial election case should be resolved.
“Is this not fraud with the people of Pakistan?” she asked.
“The question as to why an elected PM was ousted for possessing a work permit from another country, and for not disclosing a salary he did not receive from his son in his taxes and the question as to why the verdict against Nawaz Sharif still stands despite the testimonies of his innocence are not answered.”
Maryam declared SC judge Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi, “a facilitator of Imran Khan, whose corruption case is awaiting trial at the Supreme Judicial Council” and similarly, former justice Shaukat Saddiqui’s case is also awaiting trial at the SJC.
She said that nothing could scare her from telling the truth.
She said Imran talks about rule of law but when he was summoned to courts, he first presented his leg injury, then his age, and then security reasons as pretext to evade court hearings.
“Finally, when police were sent to his residence to ensure his presence in a court of law, the PTI workers attacked police, throwing petrol bombs and marbles at them. Imran Khan even called GB (Gilgit Baltistan) Police to his rescue,” she remarked.
She called the former premier a “hypocrite” who is putting the lives of his workers at risk, all the while keeping his own safety as his top priority.
“Imran first accused the establishment of trying to kill him; then he accused [interior minister] Rana Sanaullah; then the Punjab Police; then the Islamabad Police chief and finally Punjab Caretaker Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi.”

5,Legal fraternity differs on modus operandi,"Voices sounded alarms that SC 'seized' power from legislative, executive branches to have final say on Constitution","Although the legal fraternity is unanimous that the discretionary powers of the chief justice of Pakistan must be regulated, they have a difference of opinion on whether this should be carried out through an act of parliament or amending the Supreme Court Rules, 1980.
The CJP currently enjoys unfettered discretionary powers to form benches, ‘fix’ cases and initiate public interest proceedings under Article 184 (3) of the Constitution.
Similarly, as the chairman of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) as well as the Supreme Judicial Council, he has vast discretionary powers in the process of appointments of judges and their removal under Article 209 of the Constitution.
After issuing a wave of hotly-contested decisions in recent months, voices -- both inside and outside -- have sounded alarms that the Supreme Court had “seized” the power from the legislative and executive branches to have the final say on the Constitution.
However, legal experts reckon that the apex court is unwilling to concede its jurisdiction as the federal government is considering stripping the superior judiciary of its powers and returning it to where it thinks it belongs.
The top court, they believe, will wrest it back by striking its gavel.
The federal government has approved a draft to carry out legislation regulating the CJP's powers to invoke public interest jurisdiction under Article 184 (3) of the Constitution, fixation of cases and composition of benches.
However, the lawyers are debating as to whether or not a “divided” SC will review these proposed amendments.
A senior lawyer has already opposed any move to regulate the discretionary powers of the CJP through a simple piece of legislation. He emphasised that it could only be carried out through amendments to the SC’s rules -- a move that could only be carried out by the top court itself.
Similarly, former additional attorney general Waqar Rana echoed the senior lawyer’s views, saying that the jurisdiction of the apex court could only be determined by the Constitution and there was no other way.
He added that there was no authority to regulate the CJP’s powers through a simple legislation.
Read ECP had no authority to postpone elections: CJP Bandial
Rana pointed out there were SC judgments defining the powers of the CJP that could not be overturned through a simple act of parliament as an amendment to the Constitution was required for this purpose.
It is being witnessed that PTI lawyers are opposing the government’s proposed legislation to curtail the CJP’s powers.
Last year, Senator Ali Zafar had given his opinion that amendments to the law would merely translate into procedural changes.
He noted that a constitutional amendment was required to place regulations on the jurisdiction.
Barrister Asad Rahim Khan observed that curtailing the CJP’s power through an act of parliament was a “clownish” attempt -- in the same vein as Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu -- to declaw the one institution standing in the way of the Constitution’s violation.
“It can’t be done through ordinary legislation, and it attacks the independence of the judiciary,” he added.
Commenting on the proposed amendments, former Sindh High Court Bar Association president Salahuddin Ahmed said they were “excellent”.
He added that the much-needed amendments were what all the bars had been demanding for at least a decade.
“Everyone should stand behind them [amendments]. If the PTI is wise and not playing an ‘all or nothing game’, it will support them,” he continued.
He also referred to Article 191, which specifically read: “Subject to the Constitution and law, the SC may make Rules”.
In December 2019, ex-CJP Asif Saeed Khosa, in a full court meeting, had shared with other apex court judges a draft of proposed amendments to the Supreme Court Rules, 1980 to regulate suo motu power, exercised by the chief justice to adjudicate public interest matters.
These amendments were almost similar to the ones, which are now being proposed by the federal government.
However, no full court meeting has been convened to approve the amendments to the SC Rules, 1980 for the last three years.
It is expected that the CJP now might form a full court to review the legislation from a judicial perspective.

6,Govt hatching conspiracy to divide judiciary: Imran,"PTI chief warns govt, ‘neutrals’ human rights violations will take ugly turn if they don’t mend ways","Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman and former prime minister Imran Khan has warned the government and “neutrals” that the human rights violations can take ugly turn if they did not mend their ways.
“I want to tell the ‘neutrals’ that free and fair elections are the only way forward as their strategy of threatening the public has badly failed and backfired,” the PTI chief said while addressing the nation via video link from his Zaman Park residence on Tuesday.
The former premier reiterated that the responsibility of implementing the rule of law in the country was now on the shoulders of the legal fraternity. “The government is hatching a conspiracy to divide the superior judiciary for its personal interests,” he maintained.

Imran invited the lawyers of the country to participate in the Lawyers’ Convention being held in Lahore on Wednesday (today) as it was high time for the legal community to put their differences aside for the implementation of the rule of law in the country.
On the other day, he highlighted, Barrister Hassaan Niazi was arrested and a series of fake cases were registered against him in different provinces.
The imported government and its handlers had also abducted several social media activists to silence their voice, he said, adding that restrictions were being imposed on media to silent opposing voices.
“The legal fraternity is not being allowed to function for the implementation of rule of law in the country,” he added.
The former premier stressed that every Pakistani citizen had to raise his voice for the rule of law in the country otherwise the situation would further deteriorate and provision of justice would become a distant dream from common citizens and human rights violations would further increase.
The gross human rights violations witnessed in the last 11 months, Imran pointed out, were not witnessed in any democracy.
“Unprecedented inflation has been witnessed during this period as the imported rulers have no plan to rein in the economic chaos in the country. Their complete focus is to find an escape route from elections.”
The PTI chairman warned that the way the government and the establishment were trying to silent opposing voices and deteriorating economic situation had pushed the country towards a dangerous point.
Torture on political workers and common citizens was increasing hatred among the masses and this situation could go to the point where nobody would be able to handle the situation.
“I am trying my best to calm down my workers and supporters but it will not work for long,” he added.
Imran pointed out that when he appeared for hearing in the Islamabad court, the police and “unidentified” persons attacked his party workers to instigate violence. Same happened on the previous hearing.

A journalist of a foreign TV channel had witnessed how the police and neutrals attacked peaceful workers of his party. Because neither the government nor the neutrals wanted to hold elections in the country. “We want free and fair elections to bring back political stability but the government and their handlers want to create unrest in the country,” he maintained.
Lamenting the government’s free wheat flour distribution campaign, the former premier pointed out that over eight precious lives were lost and dozens of citizens had been injured owing to this cheap publicity stunt of the incumbent rulers.
“During the Covid pandemic, the PTI government distributed Rs14,000 stipend to needy families in a transparent and dignified way, while the incumbent rulers are humiliating common citizens in long queues for flour distribution,” he highlighted.
