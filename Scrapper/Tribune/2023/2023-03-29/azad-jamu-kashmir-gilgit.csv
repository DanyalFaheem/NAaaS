4,FUUAST fined Rs1 million for flouting environmental laws,EPT takes action against varsity for continuing construction project despite repeated notices,"The Environmental Protection Tribunal (EPT) imposed a fine of Rs1 million on the Federal Urdu University of Arts, Science, and Technology (FUUAST) for flouting Section 12 of the Pakistan Environmental Protection Act 1997 (PEPA 1997) during the construction of the varsity despite repeated notices and show cause issued by Pak-EPA to seek environmental approval from the agency.
The decision of the tribunal noted that the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) filed a complaint with the Tribunal against the university and the Capital Development Authority (CDA) stating the former as the project proponent and the latter as responsible for the development and management of all the affairs as per its laws and regulations in the federal capital territory.
The complainant (Pak-EPA) maintained that the project proponent had to ensure measures for the development of the project as per the CDA Laws, Rules and Regulations and provision of the PEPA 1997. However, the project proponent (FUUAST) had not obtained environmental approval for their aforesaid project under Section 12 of the PEPA 1997 and IEE/EIA regulations 2000. 
The EPA team held site inspections of the university on December 16, 2020, followed by a hearing notice held on February 15, 2021, which was not attended by the University and CDA officials. 
Consequently, the agency served another notice on March 29, 2021, for a personal hearing attended by the CDA officials and not the FUUAST representatives.

7,Inflation-hit people flock to free meal centres,Large number of deserving people break their fasts at langar khanas,"There has been an extraordinary swell in the number of those who break their fast at langar khanas [free food distribution centres] running on donations in the city and Cantt due to the intensification of the wave of inflation.
With the closure of langar khanas, established under the previous government, the number of deserving people at the free food distribution centres has increased.
A large number of poor and needy people and those belonging to the middle class including labourers, security guards, watchmen, porters and travellers are among the people who break their fasts at langar khanas and dastarkhwans where the hosts respectfully serve them with dates, pakoras, juices, fruits, roti, curry and rice for iftar.
Meanwhile, financial support from philanthropists for the langar khanas has also been increased in the holy month.
According to sources, there has been an increase in the number of langar khanas and dastarkhwans in the city and Cantt before Ramazan where regular floor rugs are laid and the people who come for iftar are seated.
On one hand, philanthropists are actively participating while on the other hand, there is also the passion of those who work voluntarily to serve the people with respect.
The people who visit these langar khanas along with the host organisers offer a collective prayer before breaking their fasts. The organisers of the Royalty Langar established in Rawalpindi’s Gawalmandi area said that while the number of people has increased during Ramazan the philanthropists are also serving the people generously.
Selani Langar, Abbasia Welfare Trust and other langar khanas in City hospitals, Murree Road and other public places are organising iftar meals for the people with complete arrangements.
The administration placed banners on the langar khans for the collection of donations in which a donation of Rs250 per person for a one-time meal has been requested to be deposited at the langar khanas by those who can afford it.
Iftar dinner is being regularly organised by Saeed Yusuf Khan, a philanthropic lawyer, in the district court of Rawalpindi for the last 13 years where the lawyer himself and his children arrange the iftar meals for the people.
Mass iftar meals are also being organised at other places in the city including General Bus Stand Pir Wadhai, Allama Iqbal Park, Peshawar Mor, Railway Station, Sadiqabad, Gulshan Dan Khan and other locations.
The management of these langar khanas says that people who come to the langar khanas are served and also given packed food for takeaway.
On the other hand, philanthropists have also prepared special iftar boxes for passengers at places like General Bus Stand Pir Wadhai, Peshawar Mor, and the railway station which are distributed just before iftar time so that they can break their fasts during the journey.
