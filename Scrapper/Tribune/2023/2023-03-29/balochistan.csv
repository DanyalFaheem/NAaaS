6,‘Dialogue key to end impasse’,HRCP stated that it was deeply concerned that the crisis had resulted in polarisation across the political spectrum,"Stressing the importance of strengthening the democratic process, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has maintained that there is no other option for the opposition and the government but to hold meaningful dialogue in parliament to resolve the ongoing crisis in the country in the interest of the people.
Following a governing council meeting to deliberate on the current political crisis and constitutional impasse, the HRCP stated that it was deeply concerned that the crisis had resulted in polarisation across the political spectrum. 
""This state of affairs was, regretfully, triggered by events that were designed to stall the democratic process and undermine the efficacy and legitimacy of parliament. One political party first abandoned the National Assembly and then dissolved two provincial assemblies. Others in government blocked the subsequent reversal of this move by thwarting the opposition’s attempt to return to the National Assembly,"" the commission stated.
""Despite its considered view that the dissolution of the Punjab and K-P assemblies was politically expedient, the HRCP is concerned that these assemblies' elections have been postponed till October by the Election Commission of Pakistan.
