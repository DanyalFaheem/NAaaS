0,Two die in K-P as strong tremors jolt upcountry,"Scores of others injured in 6.8 quake; NDMA, PDMAs put on alert; two more people killed in neighbouring Afghanistan","A strong earthquake jolted many parts of the country, killing at least two people, including a child, and injuring dozens others in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab on Tuesday evening.
The magnitude of earthquake was recorded at 6.8 on the Richter scale with its epicentre in Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan at a depth of 180 kilometres, according to Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD).
The United States Geological Survey put the magnitude of the earthquake at 6.5, which was centred near Jurm in northeastern Afghanistan at a depth of 187 kilometres. The USGS said that the tremors were also felt in Afghanistan and India for 30 seconds.
Reports from different parts of the country said tremors were felt in several cities, including Islamabad, Peshawar, Charsadda, Lahore, and Rawalpindi. After the earthquake, frightened people fled their homes and came out in the open.
“People ran out of their houses and were reciting the Quran,” said an AFP correspondent in Rawalpindi. Ikhlaq Kazmi, a retired professor, said his entire house shook. “The children started shouting that there is an earthquake,” he said. “We all ran out.”
At least 180 people, who suffered minor injuries, were taken to hospitals across the K-P, Shahidullah Khan, a senior government official, told AFP. K-P’s Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) confirmed two fatalities in the province.
Police officer Shafiullah Gandapur in Swat said that a 13-year-old girl died when a wall of her house collapsed, while 150 people were injured across the district.
He added that emergency had been declared at the hospitals in the district.
Other reports from the province said that at least five members of a family were injured after the roof of their house collapsed in Swabi and 29 people, including women and children, were injured in Malakand divison and other areas.
The PDMA in Punjab said that more than 18 districts were jolted but no loss of life was reported. However, a PDMA spokesperson said that cracks had appeared in some high-rise buildings in Rawalpindi.
“Rescue teams have been dispatched to evacuate the affected buildings,” the spokesperson said, adding that orders had been issued to the administrations across Punjab to check other high-rise buildings for any damage.
Tremors were felt in Manjhipur, Dera Allahyar and Jafarabad areas of Balochistan, PDMA said. It put the administrations on alert and directed for taking precautionary measures in all hospitals to deal with any emergency.
In the Azad Jammu and Kashmir capital of Muzaffarabad – the site of a deadly earthquake in 2005 that killed more than 80,000 people – people ran out of their homes, crying and reciting holy verses, according to a Reuters report.
A statement from the Prime Minister’s Office said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif ordered the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and other relevant institutions to stay alert to deal with any untoward situation.
An emergency has been declared in the hospitals of the federal capital, including the Islamabad Polyclinic and the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) Hospital, officials said.
According to the international seismological centre, apart from Pakistan, tremors were also felt in Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, China, Afghanistan and Kyrgyzstan. Shaking was also felt as far as the Indian capital, New Delhi.
The European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) said that the 6.5-magnitude earthquake struck northern Afghanistan, adding that the tremor was very deep, 194 kilometres, and its epicentre was in the Hindu Kush mountain range, near Badakhshan.
Two people, including a child, were killed in Laghman province of Afghanistan, Shafiullah Rahimi, spokesman for Afghanistan's Ministry of Natural Disaster Management, told AFP.
In Afghanistan, many families were out of their homes celebrating Nowruz, the Persian New Year, when the quake struck. “I heard people screaming and yelling as they came out in the streets,” said Masieh, who was outside with his family when the tremor hit.
“It was a terrifying tremor. I had never felt such a tremor before in my life,” Khatera, 50, a resident of Kabul, told AFP. “Nobody dares to go inside their homes,” added Noor Mohammad Hanifi, a shopkeeper in the capital.
Authorities and aid workers said very strong shaking was felt in Badakhshan, close to the epicentre of the earthquake. A spokesperson for Red Cross said they had no immediate reports of damages from Badakhshan’s capital but were making checks on other areas.
Separately, a 5.9 earthquake struck Valparaiso, Chile, on Tuesday, the EMSC said. The quake was at a depth of 44 kilometres below the earth’s surface, it added. There were no reports of any casualties or damage immediately.

1,Imran wins protective bail in terrorism cases,LHC also grants bail to PTI chief in NAB call-up notices,"The Lahore High Court has granted protective bail to PTI Chairman Imran Khan in two separate cases. The first case involves two FIRs filed against him on terrorism charges, and the second case relates to two call-up notices issued to him by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) for different inquiries. The protective bails were granted by two division benches of the court, one led by Justice Syed Shahbaz Ali Rizvi and the other by Justice Baqar Ali Najafi.

A single bench of Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh also issued notices, seeking replies from the Punjab chief secretary and IGP by March 28 in a contempt petition filed by Imran against breach of the terms of reference (ToRs) during the Zaman Park operation at his residence that the local police, provincial administration and PTI leadership had agreed upon.
Justice Sheikh, while hearing another plea filed by PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry seeking details of the cases registered against Imran and other party leaders, sought the complete record from the federal law office along with an affidavit by March 22.
The judge also restrained authorities from taking any coercive measures against Imran and other leaders until the submission of the details to the court.
As the proceedings commenced, Imran’s lawyers Azhar Siddique and Barrister Salman Safdar complained to the court about the police violating the ToRs after giving a commitment to the court.
They argued that the police had committed contempt of court by conducting an “illegal” operation at Imran’s Zaman Park residence under the garb of a search warrant.
The PTI chief, appearing first before Justice Sheikh’s court, took the rostrum and said he was hiding before reaching the LHC.

He added that he had used a vehicle, which was not familiar to anyone.
Imran, who was ousted from the post of the prime minister in April last year, complained that his wife was at home when police forcibly went inside by breaking the main gate and windows.
He added that the operation was carried out despite the police high-ups, local administration and PTI reaching an agreement on the ToRs.
The PTI chief maintained that the screaming of his family members could be heard on the CCTV cameras installed at his residence.
He expressed his astonishment that he was being restrained by police officials from heading towards courts so that he could acquire bail in the cases against him.
On a point, Justice Sheikh remarked that he would not spare those who were making a mockery of the judiciary on TV talk shows.
The lawyers also told the court that several cases had been registered against the PTI chief and other party leaders, but they were not being provided with their details.
During the proceedings, Justice Sheikh directed Imran’s private guards to leave the court, noting that the police officials present there were enough for his security.
However, the assistant advocate general expressed his lack of trust in the court, requesting the judge to shift the matter to another one.
This irked Justice Sheikh, who asked which specific aspect he lacked confidence in, adding that the matter was already proceeding in his court.
He warned that he would initiate contempt proceedings if this conduct was repeated.
Justice Sheikh remarked that the court had been issuing notices, seeking the record of the cases.
“Today is the era of WhatsApp. You can obtain the record through WhatsApp,” he added.
After that, Imran appeared before a division bench headed by Justice Syed Shahbaz Ali Rizvi, where he was granted protective bail until March 27 in two FIRs registered against him under different charges including Section 7 of Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA).
As proceedings started, Imran’s lawyer Barrister Salman Safdar told the court that the signatures on the petitions and other documents were scanned, but originally belonged to his client.
To this, Justice Rizvi directed the lawyer to acquire his client's original signatures on the petitions, affidavit and other related documents.
When the lawyer told the bench about two protective bails in NAB-related matters, Justice Rizvi observed that this bench was not hearing matters pertaining to the anti-graft body.
Those matters would be heard by the relevant bench, Justice Rizvi remarked.
However, the bench granted Imran protective bails in two FIRs registered against him in Golra and CTD police stations in Islamabad.
Later, Imran had to wait in the same court for the fixation of his pleas related to NAB’s call-up notices to him.
As the PTI chief left for the other division bench, police officials intercepted his vehicle.
They did not allow him to move towards that courtroom along with his vehicle. Imran had to reach there on foot.
The PTI chief appeared before another division bench headed by Justice Najafi, where he had filed pleas for two protective bails – one in a NAB’s call-up notice in response to an inquiry it had initiated for the “misuse of authority; criminal breach of trust; and illegal gain in selling gifted state assets” and the second  call-up notice issued by the anti-graft body in connection with its probe pertaining to “misuse of authority; financial gains and criminal breach of trust in recovery of crime proceeds received from the UK; and illegal sealing of its record”.
Imran’s lawyer Safdar told the court that an institution was already conducting an investigation and a trial was also underway.
However, he added that all of a sudden, NAB also started an inquiry into the Toshakhana case.
The lawyer argued that it had become an uphill task for him to assist his client in the bulk of cases registered against him.
He told the court that this time, 97 cases had been registered against Imran and other party leaders.
To this, another lawyer representing the PTI chief Azhar Siddique told the court that his client was approaching his “non-cricketing” century.
The lawyers argued that Imran wanted to appear before Islamabad’s relevant court but a NAB team reached his Zaman Park residence every day.
The bench granted Imran protective bails till March 31.
Taking the rostrum, Imran told the court that the elections were scheduled to take place on April 30, but his movement had been confined to the courts instead of him running his poll campaign.
He added that by attending court proceedings, there was no time left for him to distribute election tickets.
The PTI chief claimed that no FIR was registered against him for 50 years, but now 96 had been filed in the last six months.
Earlier, as Imran’s vehicle reached near the court of Justice Sheikh, a pistol was seen near it.
After hue and cry, police officials took the pistol into their possession.
Later, it was stated that perhaps it belonged to a police official and it fell down because of the crowd that had gathered at the scene.
Furthermore, as Imran was sitting before Justice Rizvi, the lawyers present there suddenly started making noise, saying there was a device behind the doors of the courtroom.
The police officials took the device into their possession and confirmed that it was only a wireless set.
Later, the officials said perhaps it belonged to a police officer.
Separately, the Islamabad High Court, while accepting the PTI chairman’s request for exemption from appearance, extended his interim bail in an “attempted murder” case till April 6.
The state counsel told the court that Imran had not participated in the investigation yet despite the issuance of two notices.
Imran’s lawyer Faisal Chaudhry told the IHC that his client was busy appearing before courts in Lahore and that was why he could not come to Islamabad.
He added that the investigating officer of the case thought that in-person recording of statement was necessary.
Chaudhry further said either the investigating officer could accompany him to Lahore for this purpose or Imran could record his statement when he arrived at the IHC.
IHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq directed Imran’s lawyer to coordinate with the investigating officer on how Imran’s statement would be recorded.
PML-N leader Mohsin Ranjha had registered a case of “attempted murder” against the PTI chairman in October last year.
He filed the case against Imran a day after being attacked outside the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) office in Islamabad, where PTI workers and supporters were protesting against the verdict of the commission, which disqualified the deposed premier in the Toshakhana case.

2,Brigadier martyred in Angoor Adda encounter,Two among seven of ISI officer’s team members critically injured,"A high-ranking Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) officer embraced martyrdom while seven others were injured, including two critically, in an encounter with terrorists in the northwestern region of the country on Tuesday.
The region has seen a resurgence of terrorist attacks since late last year, including a deadly bombing of a mosque in the city of Peshawar in which nearly 100 people, mostly policemen, were martyred.
According to a statement issued by the military’s media wing, Brigadier Mustafa Kamal Barki encountered hardcore terrorists in the Angoor Adda locality of South Waziristan, a mountainous region that borders Afghanistan and has long been a hotbed of militants.
The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that Brigadier Barki and his team put up a valiant resistance against the terrorists during the encounter and the officer sacrificed his life for peace of the motherland.
“Intense firing was exchanged with terrorists and two of Brigadier Barki's team members are in critical condition.”
No group has claimed responsibility. Most attacks in the region have been claimed by the outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
""[The] defence forces of Pakistan and intelligence agencies pledge to reaffirm and demonstrate firm resolve to eliminate the menace of terrorism from every inch of the country,"" it added.
Brigadier Barki was instrumental in locating and eradicating terrorists responsible for vicious assaults in Pakistan, including the Army Public School (APS) attack in Peshawar.
He received his commission in the esteemed Frontier Force Regiment of Pakistan on October 12, 1995. The martyred officer is survived by his spouse, daughter, and son.
The nation mourns the loss of their fallen hero, as he is honoured for his bravery and sacrifice.
Pakistan's security forces have conducted numerous operations against terrorism across the country, not only arresting terrorists and their facilitators but also foiling several attacks during the last three months.
Brigadier Barki is the second most high-ranking ISI official who embraced martyrdom.
In January, two ISI officials — Director Naveed Sadiq Sial and Inspector Nasir Abbas — were martyred in a gun attack at a roadside restaurant in the Pirowal area of Khanewal.
A little-known terrorist group calling itself Lashkar-e-Khorasan had immediately claimed responsibility, but the TTP later claimed that the deadly attack was carried out by its “secret squad”.Separately, three soldiers of Pakistan Army embraced martyrdom when terrorists opened fire on a police check post in the general area Khutti in K-P’s Dera Ismail Khan district, the ISPR said in a statement.
According to the ISPR, the security forces immediately cordoned off the area and blocked all possible escape routes.
It said that the fleeing terrorists were intercepted in the Saggu area of the district. After an intense exchange of fire, three terrorists were killed, and weapons and ammunition were recovered from them.
During the intense exchange of fire, 42-year-old Havaldar Muhammad Azhar Iqbal from Lodhran, 34-year-old Naik Muhammad Asad from Khanewal, and 22-year-old Sepoy Muhammad Essa from South Waziristan fought bravely but were martyred.
The ISPR added that the area is being sanitised to eliminate any remaining terrorists. ""Pakistan Army remains determined to eradicate terrorism, and the sacrifices of our brave soldiers strengthen our resolve,"" the statement said.
Security forces have killed at least 142 terrorists during the last three months as operations to eliminate terrorism from the country continue. At least 1,007 terrorists were arrested during 6,921 operations by security forces across the country in the last three months.
A total of 1,960 operations were conducted in K-P, of which 1,516 were area-domination operations, 301 were intelligence based operations, and 143 were area-sanitisation operations.
As a result of the operations conducted by the security forces, 98 terrorists were killed and 540 were arrested in K-P.

3,Taliban GDI team quietly visits Islamabad,A source in Kabul said that the 10-member delegation led by DGI chief assured Pakistan of addressing its concerns,"An Afghan Taliban delegation, comprising intelligence and security officials, quietly visited Islamabad recently to discuss a way forward towards addressing Pakistan’s concerns regarding the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), sources said on Monday.
Taliban ranks in Kabul also confirmed that a mid-level delegation led by Abdullah Ghazanavi, the head of the General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI), travelled to Pakistan for discussion on the TTP and threats to Pakistan.
The sources said the visit was a follow-up of last month’s trip to Kabul by a high-powered delegation led by Defence Minister Khawaja Asif.
The delegation received a briefing on the steps taken by the Afghan government to deal with the TTP.
The Pakistani delegation, however, deemed those steps unsatisfactory and sought concerted actions.
Pakistan also confronted the Afghan Taliban leadership with proofs about the whereabouts of the TTP leadership.
During its stay in Islamabad, the sources said, the Afghan delegation met with the relevant authorities to discuss the security situation and the fate of the TTP and its affiliates.
A source in Kabul with the knowledge of matter told The Express Tribune on the condition of anonymity that the delegation, comprising 10 members form the Taliban’s GDI, visited Islamabad last week.
The delegation was also assisted by GDI official Muhammad Wardak, the source said, adding that the delegation was mandated to deliver a massage from Kabul that the concerns of Pakistan would be addressed.
Both sides stayed mum on the visit. The sources in Islamabad said that given the sensitivity of the issue, both sides decided to discuss such matters away from the media glare.
The source in Kabul revealed that both sides made progress on various issues, but he was not authorised to make public statements.
The TTP has become a thorny issue between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban. Pakistan expected the Afghan Taliban to address its concerns regarding the TTP after its return to power in August 2021. But contrary to the expectations, the TTP attacks only went up.
The Afghan Taliban’s reluctance to take on the TTP stemmed from its fears that the group’s fighters might join Da’esh. Second, the Afghan Taliban and the TTP share the same ideology as they fought alongside the US-led foreign forces.
Nevertheless, the two sides have been trying to find a way out of the TTP problem as it has threatened to undermine their future cooperation.

4,Coalition to get tough on PTI,Joint session summoned tomorrow; govt to take ‘important decisions’ to ensure state’s writ,"The ruling coalition on Monday hinted at banning the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), as the government claimed the party had become a terrorist outfit after its involvement in attacking state institutions, including the army, the judiciary, and law-enforcement agencies.
The coalition government condemned the attacks carried out allegedly on the orders of PTI Chairman Imran Khan on police and Rangers, who were implementing court orders when they went to his Zaman Park residence in Lahore and when Imran came along with his supporters to a court in Islamabad the other day.
The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-led ruling alliance held a six-hour-long huddle with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in the chair. The meeting was attended by leaders of the coalition parties and federal ministers.
An official statement issued following the meeting stated that a joint session of parliament had been called on March 22 (tomorrow) for taking important decisions to ensure the writ of the state.
The meeting also strongly condemned a social media campaign being run from abroad against the state institutions, especially against Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen Asim Munir, and asked the overseas Pakistanis not to be a part of this “sinister agenda”.
The condemnation come hours after Prime Minister Shehbaz, in a tweet, accused Imran of “damaging the country and undermining our armed forces and their leadership” and stressed the need for rejecting his political rival’s “agenda”.
Shehbaz stressed that the “overseas patriotic Pakistanis should raise their voice against the foreign-funded campaign,” and cautioned them against the “poisonous politics” in which they were being used as pawns.
“PTI’s disgusting smear campaign against Chief of the Army Staff General Asim Munir at the behest of Imran Niazi is deserving of the strongest condemnation,” Shehbaz tweeted.
The meeting decided that legal action would be taken against those running a dirty campaign from abroad against the martyrs of Lasbela last August. They said that this behaviour was unacceptable in any society and “this is not freedom of speech”.
The alliance leaders expressed concerns over the treatment meted out to the PTI chairman by the courts, saying: “The treatment of Imran Khan and his colleagues is deepening the impression that the scales of justice are not equal”. The official statement declared that “two standards of justice in one country are not acceptable”.
Also, the prime minister and other key members of the ruling alliance condemned an audio leak purportedly of a former chief justice of Pakistan and a PTI lawyer, saying that the vulgar conversation about PML-N Senior Vice President Maryam Nawaz Sharif in the leaked audio was alarming.
In the meeting, according to the official statement, the overall economic, political, internal and external law and order situation of the country was discussed in detail.
The meeting was apprised of the prime minister’s initiates for the economy, restoration of the IMF programme, public relief, including Kisan package, free supply of flour to the poor families in Ramazan, subsidy on petrol price for people with low wages and income.
It was also given a briefing about the special discount schemes, conduct of the CSS special examination for the country’s youth, promotion of solar energy, interest-free and subsidised loans for youth, rehabilitation of flood victims and other programmes.
The statement said that the meeting appreciated Shehbaz’s efforts for restoring the economy and the IMF programme, while simultaneously providing maximum relief to the people despite the difficult conditions. The allied parties expressed full confidence in Prime Minister Shehbaz.
While condemning the attacks and violence on police and Rangers on the order of Imran Khan, the huddle not only declared that it was unacceptable but said that attacking officers and employees of the state institutions by violent and trained groups with petrol bombs, sticks, guns, arms, was very alarming.
“This behaviour is not at all constitutional, legal, democratic and political,” the statement read. “Taking up arms against the state, targeting its officers and men, firing at them, burning vehicles, besieging and ransacking court premises, looting, throwing police vehicles into canals and torturing the on-duty policemen is the height of lawlessness which no state can tolerate,” the meeting declared.
The meeting expressed solidarity with the law-enforcement personnel and lauded their services. It declared that strict action should be taken against the law-breaking elements under the law and no leniency should be shown to them, adding: “Actions against the state cannot be tolerated.”
Subsequently, the meeting while referring to PTI workers clashes with the law-enforcers noted that the entire nation had seen that the PTI was not a political party but a group of trained militants of banned organisations. It said that evidences and proofs were available and it had been decided to take action in this regard according to the law.
Later, talking to The Express Tribune, a senior official denied that the government was planning to file reference in Supreme Court for banning the PTI. He, however, added that only writ of state would be maintained at any cost.
Senior lawyers believe that the process regarding the banning of a political party was so difficult as the government had to present evidences before the Supreme Court for justifying the ban.
PM Shehbaz, federal ministers, Ishaq Dar, Khawaja Asif, Rana Sanaullah, Azam Nazeer Tarar, Marriyum Aurangzeb, Ayaz Sadiq, Ahsan Iqbal, Naveed Qamar, Sherry Rehman, Chaudhry Salik as well as PML-N’s Ata Tarar and Malik Ahmad Khan, JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, PPP’s Qamar Zaman Kaira, MQM-P’s Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, Qaumi Watan Party’s Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao, National Democratic Movement’s Mohsin Dawar, Awami National Party’s Mian Iftikhar Hussain, Jamiat Ulema-e-Pakistan’s Anas Norani, MNA Aslam Bhootani and others attended the meeting.

5,Govt’s subsidy plan raises red flags,IMF seeks details of mechanism to implement programme,"The chances of finalising the ninth review of the troubled $6.5 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) soon got bleak after the global lender on Monday raised questions over the government’s new fuel subsidy scheme.
The development came as the government decided to dole out subsidies worth billions of rupees on petrol as well as Rs73 billion on wheat flour that could potentially lay landmines in the path of the Fund’s programme.
Instead of putting its house in order, the government announced Rs50 per liter subsidy for owners of up to 800cc cars and motorcyclists while Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab will give Rs73 billion in wheat flour subsidy cumulatively.
Sources in the finance ministry said that the global lender has inquired about the source of financing of the Prime Minister’s petrol scheme. The IMF also asked about the mechanism in implementing the new subsidy programme, they added.
In her reaction, Esther Perez, the Resident Representative of the IMF, told The Express Tribune that the Pakistani “authorities did not consult with the IMF staff ahead of announcing their recent fuel subsidy proposal”.
She added that the IMF staff was seeking “greater details on the scheme in terms of its operation, cost, targeting, protections against fraud and abuse, and offsetting measures, and will carefully discuss these elements with the authorities”.
“As a general matter, the IMF sees strengthening support for those eligible for social assistance through the unconditional Kafalat cash transfer scheme (BISP) as the most direct way to help the neediest in Pakistan,” said Esther.
The federal government plans to collect Rs50 per liter extra from car owners of above 800cc category and give it to car owners of below 800cc and motorcyclists.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has the audacity to waive taxes of the richest commercial banks last month and also withdrew Rs3,000 per month tax on traders in September last year but wants to penalise middle-income group owning 1,000cc cars to fund his political scheme.
The IMF raised queries a day after the Prime Minister’s Office announced to give Rs50 per liter subsidy to the 1.3 million owners of 800cc cars and over 20 million motorcyclists and rickshaw owners.
The move may jeopardise the IMF programme, if the government’s explanation remained short of the Fund’s expectations. The chances of an early IMF deal are already thin due to many political moves made by the government and its inability to raise $6 billion additional loans.
While addressing a news conference on Monday, Minister of State for Petroleum Musadik Malik said that the government will charge Rs100 more for petrol from the affluent so that relief could be provided to the low-income segments in fuel tariff.
The government considers an owner of 1,000cc car “affluent” but it does not have the guts to slap taxes on the richest landlords and retailers.
While talking to The Express Tribune, Malik said that the owners of above 800cc cars will pay a higher price of Rs50 over and above the normal OGRA-determined petroleum products prices, which will be utilised to reduce the rate for the low-income consumers.
The per liter petrol price is Rs273, which will be increased to Rs323 at the current rates for the car owners of using above 800cc to help the PML-N and its allied parties to win the next general elections.
Due to fears that PTI Chairman Imran Khan will clean sweep, the government is dragging its feet from holding the elections and has now placed its bets on the middle- and upper-middle income groups to lure votes from the lower-middle income groups through such schemes.
In the words of a senior PML-N party leader, the cross-fuel subsidy is a double-edged sword for the government.
The state minister explained that an escrow account will be opened with the National Bank of Pakistan and the dealers claims of subsidised fuel will be settled on a daily basis.
He added that the beneficiaries will be registered against the national identity card numbers who will receive a one-time-password to claim the cheaper fuel.
A motorcyclist will receive a maximum 21 liter per month cheaper fuel with a daily cap of 3 liter while an 800cc car owner will get a maximum 30 liter per month of petrol, said Malik.
The petrol subsidy programme would be implemented within the next six weeks without any provision of subsidies being paid from the budget, said Malik.
Wheat flour subsidy
On the instructions of the Prime Minister, the two provinces have also rolled out a free wheat flour scheme in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab. The sources said that the cumulative cost of the subsidy will be Rs73 billion per month in the two provinces.
An amount of Rs53 billion will be utilised in Punjab and another Rs19 billion will be needed in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa -- a province that is already in the red and cannot afford to give subsidies.
“The Rs73 billion spending might jeopardise the recently agreed fiscal framework with the IMF, which requires Rs559 billion provincial cash surpluses,” said the Finance Ministry sources.
On the basis of the Rs559 billion cash surplus, Rs465 billion or 0.5% primary budget deficit target had been agreed upon with the IMF just last month.
The sources said that K-P had informed the prime minister that it did not have the entire Rs19 billion funds to finance the free wheat flour scheme. The plan is to give free wheat flour to 5.7 million families in the province.
An official of the Punjab Finance Department said that the provincial government will honour its commitment given to the IMF. He said that although the maximum estimated cost is Rs53 billion, it may not go that high. He said currently the provincial government bears about Rs30 billion a month wheat flour subsidy.
Recently, the untargeted subsidy has ended by increasing the released millers prices to the level of support price to end the general subsidy, he added.
The provincial government is paying Rs90 billion annual mark-up on the Rs575 billion debt taken for wheat operations in Punjab, which has become unsustainable. He said that the general wheat subsidy was financially unsustainable and will be removed and target subsidy will continue henceforth
About 15.8 million households will benefit from the free wheat flour scheme.
