0,"PTI files plea to lodge FIR against Maryam, Sana",Move comes as Race Course police refused to register FIR," 
The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Tuesday filed an application in the court for registration of a First Information Report (FIR) against PML-N Senior Vice President Maryam Nawaz and Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah among others.
A request has been filed in the district and sessions court to register an FIR against Maryam, Sanaullah, Punjab Inspector General of Police (IGP) Usman Anwar, Lahore Capital City Police Officer Siddique Kamyana and others in the Race Course police station.
The police station had refused to register the FIR, following which the petitioner filed an application under sections 22A and 22B in the court.
In the application, it has been argued that the Punjab IG carried out the police operation at PTI Chairman Imran Khan's Zaman Park residence on the orders of Maryam and Sanaullah. ""The sanctity of the four walls was violated,"" it stated.
Further, the plea stated that the police had been requested to register a case against the incident but it had refused to do so. The court was requested to order that the case be registered against the PML-N leaders and police officials.
On Saturday, the Punjab police stormed into the PTI chief’s house in Lahore, knocking down all barricades and doors to launch a “surprise” search operation inside the property soon after Imran left for Islamabad to appear before a court.
The footage showed cranes breaking through the main gate of the Zaman Park residence as PTI workers held their ground in a protest camp outside and scuffled with the officials.
The search warrants shared by the police obtained under Section 47 of CrPC read, ""investigating officer is directed to accompany a lady police officer not below the rank of inspector at the time of search of a requisite house in accordance with law"".
The police cracked down on the PTI supporters as it tried to muscle its way into the residence that has remained a battleground between the PTI-led opposition and the PDM government.

1,‘Plan was not my arrest but assassination’,"In a letter, Imran seeks CJ’s intervention in court appearances matter over security risk","Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief and former premier Imran Khan on Tuesday penned another letter to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Atta Bandial claiming that ""unknown"" individuals were present at the Islamabad Judicial Complex to assassinate him.
Imran made the claim seeking permission to continue court appearances via video link due to security concerns.

""I have been consistently requesting for video link facility from courts for my multiple court appearances since I am now facing over 90 cases,"" the PTI chief said, claiming that during court visits, he was provided with ""no security"" despite an ""assassination plot already attempted against my [Imran's] life"".
Read Judiciary on Imran’s side unlike Nawaz: lawyers
The ousted premier alleged that upon his arrival at Islamabad for his most recent court appearance, his convoy ""was trapped on all sides by containers to block arrival at the [Judicial] Complex and before the Magistrate to deliberately try and create a false situation of 'no show'"".
Imran also claimed that his supporters who had gathered to express their solidarity were ""provoked"" by the police and Rangers deployed at the premises who resorted to tear gas shelling, baton charge and stone pelting against ""unarmed citizens and PTI leadership"".
""When I was halfway through the gate of the complex the police attacked the workers around my car without any provocation,"" he said, stressing that it was at this point that he realised ""that something was amiss and that it was not my arrest that was being planned but my assassination"".
""What led credence to this was that while our lawyers were not allowed inside the Complex and were beaten back from the door, about 20 or more Unknown (""Namaloom"") people (not uniformed and with no identity displayed) were allowed inside"", he said claiming that they were ""clearly"" there to assassinate Imran.

The PTI chief also brought to the CJP's attention the unprecedented ""assault"" on his Zaman Park residence while he was in Islamabad, which he maintained was ""in complete violation of the orders passed by the Honourable Lahore High Court (LHC)"".
""My wife, a very private, non-political person was alone in the house at the time with a couple of domestic staff,"" he said while accusing the police of ""illegal entry"" by ""breaking"" the gate to his residence and ""violating the Islamic principle of sanctity of 'chadar and chardiwari' [viel and home]"".
Under the circumstances, Imran sought relief from the CJP from court appearances and requested him the launch an investigation into the aforementioned events.
It may be noted that an application seeking similar relaxations is pending with the LHC.
On Monday, the court directed the PTI counsel to visit Imran's residence in Zaman Park to confirm police deployment to ensure his security and is scheduled to resume hearing the case today.

Addressing the media in Lahore on Tuesday, PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry said the representatives of Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), Lahore High Court Bar Association, and senior journalists initiated the move to evolve consensus between the opposition and government regarding the next general elections.
“Imran Khan and PTI have agreed to their proposal. We are grateful to them for coming here. Their proposal to hold dialogue and move towards elections is very important. We fully support this,” Fawad said.
During the meeting, Fawad highlighted that he raised the issue of alleged crackdown on their party workers and leaders by the incumbent PDM government, saying that they wanted these arrests to be stopped immediately before they engaged in dialogue.

Human rights activist and veteran journalist Imtiaz Alam supported Fawad, saying: “Section 144 should not be misused to register cases against any political leader or worker. There should be no threat to the life of any political leader and apprehensions of the PTI chairman about threat to his life should be addressed.”
Alam said civil society strongly condemned exclusion of any political leader from elections and political process by political, administrative or other measures. “We appeal to all political parties, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Asif Zardari, Maulana Fazlur Rehman and others, to support the APC initiative for strengthening democracy in the country. There should be no bar on human rights, freedom of expression and right to vote in the country. It is beneficial for all political parties,” he stressed.
Being a human rights worker and journalist, Hussain Naqi said, “I believe it is of prime importance that all political parties, including the PTI, should have complete freedom to participate in politics. It is very unfortunate that we are hearing that once again the life of a political leader is under threat. Law enforcing agencies and army should probe this matter and whoever is responsible should be arrested and punished.”

3,Iqbal vows to take action against rioters,Planning minister says Imran tried to cause dent in national progress for personal gains,"Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Professor Ahsan Iqbal on Monday vowed that there will be action against all those who have been involved in the riot in order to establish writ of the state.
“(PTI Chairman) Imran Khan, for personal gains, always attempted to cause a dent in national progress and sabotage development activities taking place in the country,” the planning minister said while addressing a news conference.
""Since 2002, this person has a track record of no constructive work. Every time Imran gets angry, he goes out of parliament,” Iqbal added.
He questioned whenever Pakistan started progressing at a steady pace, why Imran always fanned lawlessness and caused political instability as well as agitation.
He said the resignations and the assemblies' dissolution had not served Imran’s purpose of collapsing the system, adding the only option that remained with him was to launch riots for creating anarchy and lawlessness.
""Now, when Pakistan is trying to come out of his government's failed economic policies which caused financial uncertainty by restoring economic contacts with the world and agreement with the IMF ... he is again attempting to sabotage the national progress and economic uplift,"" he said.
Ahsan Iqbal said Imran, who considered himself the champion and founder of the justice movement and “biggest scholar” of western democracy, was committing blatant violations of rule of law and the justice system.
""The way the state is being attacked, the federal capital and provincial capital (Lahore) were subjected to riots in an attempt to create anarchy; it has no precedent in the history of Pakistan.""
