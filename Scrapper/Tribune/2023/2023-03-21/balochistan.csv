0,‘Saudi-Iran accord beacon of hope for regional peace’,"Agreement the beginning of a ‘new order', says UCP professor","The recent peace agreement between Saudi and Iran brokered by China was the beginning of a ‘new order’ in the Middle East, said Head of Department of International Relations at the University of Central Punjab Dr Rashid Ahmed Khan.
He was speaking at a webinar organised by the Institute of Regional Studies, on Saudi-Iran rapprochement. He said that China had never challenged the US interests in the region in the past and had no intention to do so in the future. Since China was not aiming at replacing the US in the region, there would not be a power struggle between the two powers in the future, at least from the Chinese side, he added.
On implications of the recent agreement, Dr Khan said that the Saudi-Iran rapprochement would help defuse tensions in the region, particularly in Yemen. Commenting on China’s mediatory role, he said it was not something new as China had centuries-old relations with the countries in the region, and it was just the renewal of old ties, he added.

4,Grocers stop sale of subsidised flour,Citizens form long queues outside shops and stalls to obtain commodity,"Grocery merchants across the district have stopped the sale of government-subsidised flour due to not earning any profits on its sale, sparking a severe flour crisis in the Rawalpindi district as the price of wheat and flour reaches the highest level in the country’s history.
The government has stopped the supply of cheap flour to tandoors across the district due to which tandoor owners have increased the price of bread, naan and paratha.
Long queues of women, children and men have started forming outside shops and stalls to get the cheap flour which is of poor quality due to its milling from blackened wheat.
Sources said the cost of a 10kg bag of government-subsidised flour has been increased from Rs648 to Rs1160, while a 20kg bag of private flour has been increased to Rs3160. The price of wheat has also been increased from Rs2300 to Rs3900 per 40kg, they added.
Meanwhile, the flour mill owners have increased the price of flour to Rs170 per kg.
Salim Pervaiz Butt, the president of the Grocery Merchant Association, said that the price of a cheap subsidised flour bag of 10 kg has been increased to Rs1160 and its ex-mill price has been fixed at Rs1140.
“Loaders charge Rs5 per bag for loading while flour dealers charge Rs20 per bag as delivery charges to deliver the flour from mills to the shops. Thus, we get a flour bag for Rs1165 inclusive of all charges,” he said.
“Are we mad to take a bag worth Rs1165 and sell it for Rs1160?” he lamented. “Therefore, we have now stopped the sale and purchase of cheap flour throughout the district,” he added.
Shafiq Qureshi, the president of the Naan-Bai Association, said that the supply of cheap flour has been stopped to all tandoors across the district, while the price of a 79kg bag of red flour has been increased to Rs11,300 and a bag of fine flour has been increased to Rs11,900.
“The price of commercial gas cylinder for tandoors have been increased to Rs13700. For this reason, the price of red roti has been increased to Rs30, roti to Rs35, naan to Rs40 and paratha to Rs60,” he said.
“If flour becomes more expensive in Ramazan, the price of roti and naan will increase by Rs5 more,” he added.
Raza Ahmed Shah, the central leader of the Flour Mills Association, said that wheat is now being sold to the mills at Rs3900 per 40kg, so the prices of flour have been increased.
“Around 16 cheap Ramazan bazaars in Rawalpindi district will be functional from Wednesday [tomorrow]. Every cheap Ramazan bazaar will be set up in a canopy. Entry to these cheap markets will be from a walk-through gate. Every cheap market will have separate stalls for free flour, cheap flour and cheap sugar,” he said.
“Allotment of stalls in each bazaar has been completed. Instructions have also been issued to all the stall holders to set up the goods at the stalls this evening. Duties have also been assigned for security to police and the civil defence personnel,” he added.

5,IWMB launches probe into death of rare leopard,Bullet-ridden body of endangered Asian Leopard native to Margalla Hills National Park recovered from Islamabad,"The Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) on Monday initiated a probe to unearth the culprits after a bullet-ridden body of the endangered common Asian Leopard native to Margalla Hills National Park was recovered from the Shahdara area of the federal capital.
The issue came to the notice of the Wildlife Board after videos of the corpse of the Leopard by the locals made rounds on social media.
A tourist narrating in the video revealed that he was on a picnic at the Shahdara recreation spot where he found the decomposing corpse of the wildcat with its paws dismembered.
He claimed that the body was decaying as insects could be seen on the decaying carcass of the wildcat and it appeared to be some days old.
The tourist demanded the Board take notice of the issue and investigate the matter as either it was a wild animal or a pet of someone.
Later, the Board in a statement, confirmed that a dead leopard was found in Shahdara Valley of Margalla Hills National Park. “An investigation is being conducted regarding the death of the leopard. Muhammad Junaid, the local man who made the video of the dead leopard, is being interrogated,” it added.
The IWMB had prepared a preliminary medical report of the leopard and according to the initial reports, the leopard was shot eleven times.
The Scientific Committee of IWMB would make recommendations to the local police for further investigation in the light of the medical report, it added.
The IWMB also issued an X-ray of the leopard that indicated multiple bullet entrance holes penetrated the body of the wildcat.

6,RCB’s financial woes worsen,Stoppage of payments to suppliers taking toll on uplift schemes,"The Rawalpindi Cantonment Board (RCB) is facing a severe financial crisis as its expenditures have increased manifolds compared to sources of income.
Sources said the payments to contractors for the completion of development work and supply of goods to the cantonment store have also been stopped, which has affected the development schemes.
According to sources, the elected members are also facing harsh reactions from the people for not being able to solve issues of public importance.
On the other hand, the Cantonment Executive Officer has issued a policy to minimise expenditure in the institution.
The sources said that the RCB’s revenue has been badly affected due to the ongoing national economic crisis and extraordinary reduction in the construction work and sale and purchase of the real-estate property.
The recovery of property tax is also less than the set target which is also adversely affecting the board’s revenue generation.
The sources claimed that the board was spending Rs160 million for payment of salaries, Rs20 million for pension, Rs10 million for POL and Rs30 million for electricity charges and Rs10 million for transferring the solid waste from its jurisdiction each month.
“A massive amount is being spent on reimbursement of the medical claims of employees as well as advance and utility services, whereas, huge expenses are also being incurred on the board’s water supply system,” they said.
In this situation, elected members of the cantonment board said that despite the approval, the development works are not being carried out in their respective constituencies.
They said the residential areas of their wards were facing difficulties due to the non-availability of street lights.
Regarding the financial difficulties, they said the grants have not been received from the federal as well as provincial governments for a year, adding to the woes of the board.
“All the working has been reduced to just maintenance and paperwork,” they said.
When contacted, Cantonment Executive Officer, Imran Gulzar, said: “We are facing financial problems but the situation will get better from June.” He added that the board would start paying the contractors from Eidul Fitr.
Gulzar said that the development schemes, which were approved in the last board meeting, were also being worked upon.
“The months of March, April and May are not encouraging in terms of property tax recovery,” he admitted, adding: “However, the property tax recovery is high in June through which we will clear all the dues.”

A spokesperson for Islamabad police said that raids were being conducted to arrest all those who were involved in violent activities and chaos. He said that Islamabad police did not arrest any child below 10 years of age. “A smear campaign is being launched on social media against the Islamabad police and other law enforcement agencies,” the spokesman said adding that the process of identification of all the accused involved in violence was under way with the help of cameras. Islamabad police have registered cases at the CTD and Golra police stations following rioting that left 58 policemen injured.
During the rioting, four police vehicles and 25 motorbikes were burnt while nine vehicles were vandalised.
The police spokespersons said that all miscreants involved in violent acts will be brought to justice. The police were performing their duties within the ambit of the law, he said adding that hateful propaganda is being spread to prevent police officers from their legal duty. Law is equal for all and there would be no discrimination against anyone, the spokesman said and appealed to parents to keep their young children away from violence.
Meanwhile, a preliminary report of the financial losses caused by rioting by PTI workers during the court appearance of Imran Khan has been compiled.
Sources said that although Imran Khan did not appear before the judge, his journey to the judicial complex cost federal police over Rs.21.8 million.
Police sources told The Express Tribune that the Islamabad police have prepared a preliminary report of financial losses caused by PTI workers, which will be submitted to the interior ministry today (Tuesday).
Police sources said that during the appearance of Imran Khan, police vehicles worth over Rs10.5 million were broken and set on fire while Rs0.8 million were spent on food for security personnel.

Islamabad police spent Rs1 million on fuel for buses and other vehicles and cranes. Similarly, Islamabad police had to use shells worth Rs70,000 to disperse the protesters.
Police sources further said the expenses incurred on the treatment of police officers and personnel who were injured have not yet been included in the expenses and a separate report was being prepared.
Police plan crackdown on

Meanwhile, Rawalpindi police have thrashed out a major crackdown on PTI leaders and workers.
Sources said that in the first round, homes and political offices of PTI leaders will be raided. The Special Branch will assist the police in arresting the PTI leaders and workers. Those who have not been booked will be detained in jail under the MPO.
A senior police officer said that the Punjab government has given a green signal to the Rawalpindi police to immediately arrest PTI leaders and activists.

People close to the leaders can also be detained to get information about the presence of PTI leaders.
The police officer said that eight different teams have been formed for the crackdown.
According to initial reports, PTI leaders have gone into hiding to avoid arrests. Several leaders have also blocked their mobile numbers.
The police officer said that the CCTV footage of March 18 will be used to detain the activists and leaders.
The police officer said that all those against whom cases have been registered will be transferred to the respective police stations for further investigation while those against whom cases were not registered will be booked under 3 MPO and detained in Adiala jail
Court orders release of PTI workers from jail
Meanwhile, Lahore High Court Rawalpindi bench judge Justice Chaudhry Abdul Aziz declared the arrest of 125 PTI workers in Rawalpindi, Jhelum and Attock null and void and ordered their immediate release from jail.
The court declared that peaceful protest was the right of every citizen, political party and worker which cannot be denied. However, vandalism cannot be allowed during the protest, the court said.
Petitioners’ lawyers Shaukat Rauf Siddiqui, Zahid Anwar and Haroon Janjua pleaded that all the protests were peaceful during which no vandalism took place.
The police retaliated by arresting the activists from their homes and deputy commissioners detained them for a month under government pressure, they said.
The court quashed the detention orders of deputy commissioners of the three districts and rejected the plea of the Additional Advocate General to uphold the detention orders. The court ordered the immediate release of all detained PTI workers.
