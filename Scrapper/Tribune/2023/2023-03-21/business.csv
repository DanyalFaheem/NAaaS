1,Sherpao wants 18th Amendment fully enforced,QWP leader slams PTI for bringing ‘economic misery’,"Qaumi Watan Party (QWP) Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) Chairman Sikandar Hayat Khan Sherpao said on Monday that solution to all the problems of the province lies in provincial autonomy.
He said concrete measures should be taken to remove the difficulties faced by the provinces, including relief for the deprivations of the provinces and the restlessness of the people by fully implementing the 18th Amendment.
He expressed these views while addressing a gathering in the Mirza Dher area of district Charsadda.
On this occasion, officials and workers of Jamaat-e-Islami (JI), Haider Ali, Fakir Mama, Bahrullah, Muslimur Rehman, Naseer, Gulfraz, Yasir, Dawood, Sulaiman, Ijaz, Yasin, Yusuf Gul, John Sher, Shakeel, Nahar, Shahid Khan and Shahzad, along with their colleagues and families, joined the QWP.
Sherpao demanded immediate payment of the arrears of the province's resources and hydropower net profit, saying that poverty and backwardness have piled up in the province.
He said that the dream of a strong and stable federation cannot be realised until the units of the country are economically stable, so measures should be taken to remedy the deprivations of the provinces.
He criticised the previous government and said that due to the “incompetence” of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), “even a country like Bangladesh” has overtaken Pakistan in economic development.
He said that inflation and unemployment are increasing and the people are also worried about getting two square meals a day.
He added that the blood of the poor people is being sucked in the form of taxes.
The QWP leader said that instead of putting more burden on the people, the rulers should take steps to reduce their expenses.

2,K-P asks Punjab to lift ban on flour delivery,Caretaker govt kicks off Ramazan package,"The caretaker government of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) has contacted the Punjab government with a request to remove ban on the delivery of flour and all other obstacles immediately.
The caretaker government has also started implementation of the Ramazan package worth Rs19.77 billion for 36.8 million people registered under the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) in the province, whereby 5.7 million households would be supplied 30kg flour each.
Apart from the establishment of more than 7,600 sale points, other points have also been set up at 1,600 Utility Stores from where flour can be obtained by showing the card.
Minister for Food and Irrigation Fazl Elahi and Minister of Information Barrister Feroze Jamal Kakakhel, while addressing a press conference at the food department, said that the prime minister announced the provision of free ration in Ramazan, in continuation of which the government is also starting the free ration programme.
“Due to floods and poverty, people are facing economic difficulties, and despite these difficulties, we are giving packages,” he said. “We produced 1.3 million tonnes of wheat,” he said.
Food Minister Elahi said that this year, the government gave a subsidy of Rs35 billion to PASCO and bought wheat.
During the month of Ramazan, from Rs19.77 billion, the government will give flour to 5.7 million families or 36.8 million people under BISP, and 7,600 sale points will be established, alongside 1,600 points at Utility Stores, he added.
Every eligible family will need to bring original identity card, those who are not registered in BISP can apply and get registered within 24 hours, he further said.
The food minister said that currently the subsidised supply has been stopped and the Ramazan package will be implemented.
Subsidised flour supply will resume after Ramazan, he added.
He also asked philanthropists to help the poor and asked hoarders and those who sell things at expensive rates to change their behaviour. Secretary food said that flour will be given on BISP card.
“This is a targeted subsidy. Every household will get it once, we will do full monitoring so that there is no problem,” he added. “The federal government has provided BISP data and linked us with Utility Stores.”
Three bags of 10 kg will be given to the beneficiaries in a month, he said.
The secretary said that K-P procures 75 percent wheat from Punjab and other sources while it produces 25 percent itself.
Earlier, there were some issues related to the availability of wheat flour last month. This had prompted Caretaker Minister for Communications and Works (C&W) Muhammad Ali Shah to order redressal of complaints related to flour distribution in the Malakand Division.
Reports like these give rise to the speculations that there might be some cases of mismanagement.

Scores of innocent lives were lost in the accidents, involving passenger buses and vans, on the roads of the province in recent months. Many road crashes involved barrels of oils which caught fire, burning the passengers alive.
In a recent meeting of the Apex Committee, chaired by Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Abdul Quddus Bizenjo, several special measures were ordered regarding the owners and drivers of the passenger coaches, buses and wagons.
The owners and drivers of vehicles on the national highways, especially on the Quetta-Karachi highway, have been directed to ensure installation of trackers to check the speed of the vehicles to protect people’s lives.
The Apex Committee also banned carrying petrol, diesel and other inflammable materials on the passenger vehicles. In this regard the district administrations were ordered to ensure strict implementation of these measures.
Acting on the decisions, Balochistan Chief Secretary Abdul Aziz Uqailli directed the commissioners, deputy commissioners and provincial transport authority to check the speed of passenger vehicles and take legal actions in case of any violations.
Following the orders, all the district administrations have started the checking of passenger vehicles on the highways passing through their areas, as well as the movement of petrol, diesel and other inflammable materials.
