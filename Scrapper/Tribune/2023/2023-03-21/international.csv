0,PHC initiates process for pricing of healthcare services,Establishes dept for implementation of regulations,"Following the orders of the Lahore High Court, the Punjab Healthcare Commission (PHC) has initiated the process for pricing healthcare services at all kinds of healthcare establishments (HCEs).
In this regard, the Punjab government has notified ‘The Punjab Healthcare Commission (Pricing of healthcare Services) Regulations 2023’.
To actualise the process of determining the prices of various types of healthcare services, the PHC has established a pricing department.
As per the regulations, each HCE will undertake activity-based costing of all healthcare services being provided by it, including but not limited to commonly undertaken procedures, including ancillary facilities.
The PHC will notify a framework containing the features and requirements which every HCE will require to follow and fulfil while determining the cost of their services and procedures.
After completion of the costing exercise following the notified framework, and adding a profit margin not exceeding 20% of the actual cost, each HCE will submit it to the Commission along with a complete record for formal approval.
Moreover, the pricing department of the PHC will take all possible measures to ensure that all HCEs, and persons working or employed comply with the regulations.
The department will take action against violating HCEs and healthcare service providers by suspending services, sealing the premises or any part of it, imposition of a fine or may give any other appropriate order or direction as deemed necessary under the particular circumstances. These actions will be taken upon complaints or if irregularities are found during monitoring.

1,Sindh rejects cotton price fixed by Centre,CM’s agriculture adviser says purchase price should be enough to incentivise growers,"The Sindh chief minister’s adviser on agriculture, Manzoor Wassan, said on Monday that the provincial government had rejected the centre’s decision of fixing Rs8,500 per maund  (40kg) buying rate of cotton. 
Addressing a balloting event for distribution of laser land levellers in Hyderabad, Wassan said the purchase price of cotton should be fixed between Rs10,000 to Rs12,000 per maund.
“The farmers will only cultivate a crop if they get a good price for it,” he observed, underlining the importance of the cotton crop for the export-oriented textile industry of Pakistan. He recalled that the cotton farmers of Sindh sustained colossal financial losses last year due to the torrential rains and floods. He argued that a good price for the crop is also necessary to incentivize such farmers.
He informed that the provincial government is spending Rs8.5 billion to provide financial support specifically to the wheat farmers who are being paid Rs5,000 per acre support. In the first phase the farmers cultivating up to 12 acres of land will receive the support while in the second phase the farmers growing wheat on 12 to 25 acres will be covered, he added.
Wassan defended the provincial government’s decision of paying Rs4,000 per maund to the wheat farmers for their crop, saying that the move will help to reduce reliance on the imported wheat which cost the country its depleting foreign exchange reserves.
He said the government has also increased the buying price of sugarcane to Rs450 while a minimum rate of Rs10,000 per maund for the cotton crop has also been recommended. According to him, 500 farmers are being given laser land levellers through the balloting.
Agriculture Secretary Aijaz Ahmed Mahesar apprised that some 1,388 teams are collecting the data of the rain and flood affected farmers who will be compensated by the government.

3,Cars stolen in Karachi being sold in Balochistan,"AVLC unearths ‘car-trafficking’ route, identifies suspects involved in illegal trade","The Anti-Vehicle Lifting Cell (AVLC) has uncovered a racket involving the sale of stolen and snatched vehicles from Karachi in Balochistan. Reportedly, two suspects, Pervaiz Magsi and Abdullah Askani, have been identified as the main accused in this illegal trade.
The AVLC obtained records of stolen and snatched vehicles from Karachi, which were reportedly then handed over to Magsi and Askani. 
The police obtained Close-Circuit Television (CCTV) footage and photos of the accused, who buy stolen cars from Karachi, particularly Toyota Corolla vehicles.
According to details, Magsi is a native of Jhal Magsi and is also wanted for his involvement in buying stolen cars while Askani is from Lasbela district. The local network of the accused operates in Karachi, snatching or stealing vehicles from different areas of the city and delivering them to Balochistan where Magsi and Askani buy them at cheap prices.
The AVLC has obtained details of this gang in the past few days and some important arrests are also expected in the case. The police have formed a team to investigate car theft and expropriation groups from Karachi in the past years for identifying groups involved in selling vehicles from Karachi to Balochistan or other districts.
According to the SSP AVLC, the gang sells the vehicles worth Rs 3.5 million for as little as Rs0.8 million to one million or even less to Magsi and Askani. The vehicles are then either used in Balochistan or their parts are taken out and sold in different markets.
Three held in string of car break-ins 
The Special Investigation Unit (SIU) claimed to have arrested three members, Naseem Khan, Khaista, Karim and Wazir Muhammad, of a gang who smashed vehicle windows in the parking areas to steal valuable goods.

4,MQM-P MPAs demand fumigation in city,"'Due to the accumulation of garbage piles in Karachi, the number of mosquitoes has increased throughout the city'","Muttahida Qaumi Movement Pakistan (MQM-P) members of the Sindh Assembly expressed their concern over the spawning of swarms of mosquitoes in Karachi.
Due to the continuous accumulation of garbage piles in Karachi, the number of mosquitoes has increased throughout the city, the members of Sindh Assembly said. They highlighted that children, senior citizens were the falling victim to diseases like malaria and dengue. 
They added that regular fumigation campaigns have not been conducted in the city for a long time due to the non-provision of funds allocated for fumigation by the provincial government for Karachi Municipal Corporation (KMC) and District Municipal Corporation (DMC). 
Earlier, the district government used to spray disinfectants on the motorcycles, but now that too has been abandoned. The Sindh Assembly members demanded the Chief Minister Sindh Syed Murad Ali Shah that the allocated fund for fumigation should be provided to the local bodies as soon as possible so that the citizens can be protected from mosquitoes and other germs.

5,Dates shortage feared this Ramazan,"Local crops destroyed by floods, while imports hampered by dollar shortage","The demand for dates surges in the holy month of Ramazan because the faithful prefer to break their fast with dates as per the tradition of the Prophet (PBUH). 
However, this year the local dates crop was destroyed by the unprecedented floods in Sindh and Balochistan, while imports have also been hampered by depleting foreign exchange reserves in the country. 
Traders say high freight charges and depreciation of rupee have pushed up the price of imported dates by 30 to 40 per cent. 
The Khajoor Bazaar in Karachi’s Lea Market is the biggest trading centre of dates in the country, where traders complain about their predicament. They say that this year, the date crops in Khairpur district of Sindh, and Panjgur and Turbat districts of Balochistan were destroyed by the floods, while the available stocks would not suffice the demand. 
Like every year, prices of dates have increased with the advent of the fasting month.
The president of the Dates Traders and Retailers Association, Hanif Baloch, told The Express Tribune that Lea Market caters to the demand of not only Sindh, including Karachi, but it also supplies dates to the entire country. 
“It’s a double whammy this season as the local date crops have been destroyed by the floods, while we cannot import dates due to non-availability of dollars in the market,” he added. “This year, only Iranian dates are available in the market, which are imported through an arrangement with Iranian traders.” 
However, the price of Iranian dates has also doubled. Last year, they were sold for Rs8,000 per 40kg, while this year the price has shot up to Rs15,000 to 17,000 per 40kg. 
Dates Merchants Association President Muhammad Sabir added that the Iranian Zahidi dates were being sold for Rs12,000 to 14,000 per 40kg, while Iranian dry dates are available at Rs600 per kg and Panjgur dates are selling at Rs700 per kg at various superstores in Karachi.
Besides religious importance, dates are one of the most popular fruits with a list of essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals, required for normal growth, development and overall well-being.
Khajoor Bazaar abuzz with flies, business activity 
While traders, wholesalers and retailers squabble over rates, the largest centre for buying and selling dates in Karachi is buzzing with flies and business activity. Khajoor Bazaar in the Lea Market area is considered as one of the oldest markets in Karachi. Some locals say that the bazaar predate British rule. 
It was close to the ancient jetty of Ghas Bandar (grass port) where seafarers brought dates from Arab countries on sail boats. Traders used to haul the delicacies from Karachi to other part of India.
The Ghas Bandar jetty is no more, but the date trade thrives. Dates from Sukkur, Khairpur, Panjgur, Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia are available here. Until two decades ago, center consisted of one to two main streets. However, the market has now shifted to new building compounds and shops across the street and wholesale business has taken a different turn. Dates are sold at retail on stalls in the old streets. There are also some wholesale centers in the area. The number of temporary shops increases during Ramazan. An estimated 50 to 60 tons of dates are sold daily in Lea Market’s Khajoor Bazaar a few months before Ramazan, which is also supplied to other parts of the country.

8,JI condemns PPP’s ‘ploy’ to delay polls in remaining UCs,'PPP does not want the local government setup in the province in first place',"Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) Karachi Ameer Engr Hafiz Naeemur Rehman has strongly condemned the Pakistan People Party over what he called was a conspiracy to further delay the local government (LG) elections in the remaining 11 union councils in Karachi.
Local government elections were withheld in 11 union councils due to demise of the candidates. However, the result of these 11 seats could turn the table in favour of JI which lags behind PPP with six seats in the race for the mayor of Karachi.
""PPP does not want the local government setup in the province in first place,"" Rehman said in his reaction to PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari's statement for challenging the schedule of April 18 polls in 11 union councils.
The JI leader said in a statement issued from Idara Noor-e-Haq, the JI Karachi headquarters, on Monday that the He said that Bilawal's statement regarding challenging the date in the Sindh High Court was the continuation of the conspiracy to keep Karachiites deprived of their due rights and particularly an empowered elected local government.

9,Bilawal rejects LG poll schedule,Tells party leaders to challenge ECP decision in high court,"Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has said that the schedule of by elections for local government released by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) is unacceptable, and the Sindh government will immediately challenge the schedule in the Sindh High Court (SHC).
Addressing the foundation laying ceremony of heart disease medical facility Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Institute of Cardiovascular Disease in Korangi, Bilawal said that the schedule of LG by-polls by the ECP is a joke.
He said that for the first time in history, the PPP had a clean sweep in local government elections in Hyderabad, while also emerging as the largest party in Karachi.
Bilawal questioned as to why PPP was not given its rightful chance to have its mayor in Karachi and Hyderabad. “Some elements are finding it hard to digest that the mayor of Karachi will be of PPP,” he said, adding that he was surprised that local bodies elections have been held in Sindh but the people are deprived of representation deliberately.
He brushed aside fears of adversaries and said PPP have stood up to people running the Thunder Squad in the city and the goons of the terrorist sitting outside the country.
Bilawal said that the medical facilities run under PPP-led government treats patients on the basis of humanity. 
The National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD) should become a model for the entire nation in every province and if other provinces want it, Nadeem Qamar is ready to give it to them. People say that NICVD is the answer to what happened to devolution of departments to provinces under the 18th Amendment of the Constitution, he said.
NICVD branches will be opened in other cities too, “we will provide free heart treatment facilities in other cities as well,” Bilawal said adding that NICVD  can compete with Europe or  with any hospital in India.
The PPP chairman said that for the last 10 to 15 years, opposition forces have been engaged in character assassination of the party, but the performance of NICVD is an answer to all.
Without naming anyone, Bilawal said the ‘opponents’ should show an institution like NICVD in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab. He urged the ‘opponents’ to leave the politics of extremism, bullying, hatred and division. If you are running your hateful politics today, you are doing yourself a disservice, he said.
Earlier, PPP chairman performed the groundbreaking ceremony of the 1,200-bed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases at Korangi. 
The ceremony was attended by Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, Federal Health Minister Qadir Patel, Provincial Health Minister Dr. Azra Fazal Pechuho, Senator Nisar Khuhro, NICVD Executive Director Dr Nadeem Qamar, all the provincial ministers, diplomats, MPAs and PPP leaders and workers in a large number. 
The new ZAB institute of cardiovascular disease stretches over an area of 40 acres, located just north of the intersection of Main Korangi Road with Shah Faisal Korangi Road. 
Speaking on the occasion, the chief minister apprised the chairman about the new ZAB institute. “This state-of-the-art complex will comprise seven buildings, occupying a total area of 2.4 million square feet, will be equipped with the most advanced medical technology,” he said.
Murad said the institute would offer specialised cardiac medical services, including 16 major and minor operating rooms, 18 cardiac-cath labs, two MRI labs, four CT labs, and a range of imaging procedures. 
The CM said that the hospital would boast the country’s largest clinical and animal research facility, among other services. 
The Pakistan Peoples Party prides itself on always recognizing healthcare as one of its major priorities, the chief minister said and added that  Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto always urged the party to focus on education and on health. “Taking her words as our mission, we have concentrated our efforts on these two sectors - health and education, and I am happy to say that our hard work is showing great results,” he said.
