0,IMF approves $3b for Sri Lanka,Four-year extended financing arrangement may help Sri Lanka emerge from its worst financial crisis in over 70 years,"The International Monetary Fund’s executive board on Monday approved a $3 billion four-year extended financing arrangement for Sri Lanka, paving the way for immediate disbursement of about $333 million to the cash-strapped country potentially helping the country emerge from its worst financial crisis in over seven decades.
Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s office said the decision will enable the country to access up to $7 billion in funding overall.
The IMF said the new Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement program aims to restore Sri Lanka’s macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability, mitigate the economic impact on the poor and vulnerable, safeguard financial sector stability, and strengthen governance and growth potential. It said the board’s approval would catalyze financial support from other development partners.
Sri Lanka defaulted on its foreign debt in April 2022 as the country plunged into its worst economic crisis, running out of cash to finance even the most essential imports, causing massive social unrest. The government has already doubled taxes, increased energy tariffs threefold and slashed subsidies to meet the IMF’s preconditions.

1,"Pakistan, Iran agree on power tariff",Total import of electricity will now reach 204MW,"Pakistan and Iran signed an agreement, on Monday, fixing a tariff range of Rs8.4 to 12.4 per unit for the supply of 100 MW to Gwadar and Gwadar Port.
Initially, the two were negotiation a tariff between Cents 9.9 to 15.3 per unit, and making it applicable with immediate effect on both the new Polan-Gabd electricity transmission line and the existing Jakigur-Mand interconnection line (the agreement for which expires on December 31, 2024).
Both sides, however, agreed on a new pricing formula. The Iranian side agreed to keep the tariffs unchanged for the existing Jakigur-Mand interconnection line until December 2024 and also agreed to bring the new tariffs for the Polan-Gabd electricity transmission line down to the range of Cents 8.4 to 12.4 per unit, which is in Pakistan’s favour.
Analysts argue that the settlement of tariffs is a positive development that will make possible the operationalisation of the 220-kV Polan-Gabd transmission line.
The additional 100MW electricity will be supplied to the region via the line and will account for addressing the electricity issues of Gwadar for the next 5-10 years. 
Both countries have completed transmission lines within their respective areas, with Pakistan completing a 29-kilometer transmission line within its territory.
Sources said that the Power Division has sought out federal cabinet’s approval of the MoU signed between Pakistan and Iran. Presently, Pakistan is importing 104MW of electricity to Balochistan’s bordering areas. With the addition of the 100MW, the total import of electricity will reach 204MW. Sources said Iran has also sought an update on an earlier understanding with Pakistan, according to which Iran will supply 5,000MW of electricity to Pakistan.

2,Rupee under pressure,Loses 0.82% at Rs284.03 vs dollar in inter-bank,"Amid persistent delay in the resumption of IMF loan programme, the rupee under renewed pressure on Monday, losing 0.82%, or Rs2.32, to Rs284.03 against the US dollar in inter-bank market.
On Thursday and Friday, the currency had cumulatively recovered 0.40%, or Rs1.14, at Rs281.71 against the greenback
Market talk suggests the revival of IMF programme is being delayed because of no firm financing commitments of around $6-7 billion from friendly countries. 
A financial expert said, “The government has very little time left ahead of general elections, then why they would give commitments to the outgoing government.” 
Another commentator said that it could take one day, one month or one year in winning financial commitments from the friendly states.

3,Govt prioritising Euro 5 and 6 fuel standards,"Plans to enforce emission standards for industries, prevent burning of agri-residue","The government is giving priority to the adoption of Euro 5 and 6 fuel quality standards under the proposed National Clean Air Policy (NCAP) in a bid to reduce pollution and improve environment.
It is planning to enforce emission standards for industries and prevent the burning of agricultural residue. The policy is also aimed at banning the open burning of municipal solid waste as well as promoting the use of low-emission cooking technologies.
Climate Change Division, while briefing the cabinet on NCAP in a recent meeting, said that Pakistan was currently considered one of the most polluted countries in the world and air quality in some urban areas of the country had touched hazardous levels.
It pointed out that short-lived climate pollutants which included black carbon, methane, hydro-fluorocarbons and tropospheric ozone had significant short-term global warming effects, adversely impacting the agricultural yield and contributing to the poor air quality.
Reducing those air pollutants had its co-benefit of decreasing the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in line with the Paris Agreement. As per the Air Quality Life Index, air pollution has reduced the average life expectancy across Pakistan by up to 2.7 years.
Premature deaths and morbidities due to air pollution cost Pakistan up to 6.5% of GDP annually, according to the World Bank (2019 report).
To date, Pakistan does not have a comprehensive air quality compliance framework and policy guidelines. To make concerted efforts across all key sectors and resolve the problem of poor air quality, the Ministry of Climate Change has developed the NCAP.
The policy is aimed at improving air quality through the implementation of various policy, technological and management-based measures, coupled with the monitoring of air quality. This can increase the national average life span by two years, reduce annual deaths by 129,500 and improve food security. Consultation had been carried out with all key stakeholders, both at the federal and provincial levels, for preparing the policy draft.
The document was based on scientific evidence and analysis that provided five major scenarios and policy recommendations. The cabinet was requested to approve the NCAP draft.
Highlighting the salient features of the policy in its briefing, the Climate Change Division emphasised that to tackle the growing challenge of air pollution and smog in major cities, the NCAP was drafted after taking the input of all stakeholders to achieve different aims. The framework for improving air quality will help reduce annual deaths, improve the health of citizens, expand economic activity and reduce trans-boundary pollution.
Its core objectives are to identify key mitigation actions, set air quality targets and facilitate the development of provincial action plans for clean air.
The government has formed the National Action Committee, which will provide policy guidance and review progress. It will update the air quality policy every five years. On the other hand, a technical committee will be responsible for devising and implementing the policy action plans.
It will report back to the National Action Committee on the progress on standards, regulations, planning capacity, institutional arrangements and building and research initiatives.
During discussion, it was suggested that the policy should be implemented expeditiously in the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) as a model, which would encourage provinces to emulate.
In that regard, it was advocated that the industries, especially in the I-9 and I-10 sectors, which were causing air and water pollution, should be relocated out of the city limits. In order to formulate a viable plan for relocation and pollution control in the ICT, it was suggested that a cabinet committee may be constituted, to which the members agreed.
Highlighting the need to prioritise interventions under the NCAP, cabinet members pointed out that short-term policy measures, which could be implemented during the tenure of current government, should be undertaken immediately, while structural reforms could be left to the next government. However, a majority of the members were of the view that all interventions should be initiated in parallel.
The cabinet considered a summary titled “National Clean Air Policy - (NCAP)”, submitted by the Climate Change Division, and approved the policy. It constituted a committee tasked with recommending workable steps for implementing the pollution control measures in the ICT and suggesting a plan for relocating the pollution-causing industries.

4,Agri-growth stagnant at 2.2 to 2.6% in 15 years,"Despite government involvement, wheat yields stagnated to 3 tonnes per hectare","The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP)’s recently published Agriculture report 2023, launched by Pakistan Business Council (PBC) and Pakistan Agricultural Coalition (PAC), showed that agriculture growth during the last 15 years in Pakistan has been restricted within the range of 2.2 to 2.6% per annum as the industry and services have driven the country’s economic growth.
“Wheat yields have stagnated close to three tonnes per hectare (30 maunds per acre) when progressive farmers within Pakistan are achieving 4.5 tonnes per hectare and other countries are achieving even more,” stated the report.
Despite so much government involvement in the production of wheat, no serious investment in wheat seed development, mechanisation, storage and processing stands on the ground.
The report showed that a sharp contrast exists in the maize and rice crops as well. With hardly any government intervention, maize yields have tripled over the past two decades completely on the steam of the private sector, while rice exporters have brought high-yielding hybrid seeds to the farmers and invested in mechanisation.
Within the agriculture sector, the livestock sector (mainly dairy and poultry) has driven agricultural growth while the five major crops, namely wheat, cotton, maize, sugarcane, and rice, have held sector growth back by growing at around 1.1% per annum in real terms for nearly two decades.
The report outlined that these five crops are taking a majority of Pakistan’s agricultural assets (land, water, labour, etc.) and not delivering what Pakistanis deserve in growth and prosperity while among ‘other crops’, mainly fruits and vegetables, there has been erratic but slow growth during this period. As a result, Pakistan’s food trade balance was a deficit of $3.6 billion in the financial year 2022 the report mentioned.
On the other hand, just three crops (wheat, rice paddy, and maize) have a farm gate value of about $12 billion, of which, nearly $1 billion is lost in quality and quantity due to traditional drying practices, sub-optimal warehousing, unfair market practices, and traditional logistics.
“Agriculture’s business model has to be changed from government-driven to private sector-driven, from rigid to entrepreneurial, from traditional to technology-based and from patronage to global competition,” suggested the report.

5,CPPA seeks tariff hike of Rs0.85 per unit,"Hearing in this regard will be conducted on March 30, 2023","Another increase in power tariffs is on the cards as the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) has filed an application with National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) seeking an increase of Rs0.85 per unit.
According to details, the CPPA on behalf of power distribution companies (DISCOs) except K-Electric (KE) has asked Nepra to approve an increase of Rs0.8569 per kilowatt hour (kWh) under Fuel Charges Adjustment (FCA) of February, 2023. The hearing in this regard will be conducted on March 30.
The CPPA, in its application, has submitted that the total electricity generated with various fuels in the month of February 2023 was recorded at 7,756 gigawatts hours (GWh) at a basket price of Rs8.0123 per unit. The total cost of energy was Rs62,140 million. Data submitted by the CPPA to Nepra also showed that net electricity delivered to DISCOs in February 2023 was 7,516 GWh at Rs8.0689 per unit, the total price of which was Rs60,648 million.
The CPPA in its tariff adjustment request advocated that the reference fuel charges for February 2023 for DISCOs were fixed at Rs7.2120 per unit with an increase of Rs0.8569/kWh over the reference fuel charges.
Nepra will also hold a hearing over KE’s petition for positive FCA at the rate of Rs1.662/KWh for the month of February on March 30th; the same day as the hearing for XWDISCOs.
It is worth noting that the price of power purchased from CPPA-G in February 2023 has increased by 15% as compared with December 2022.

6,Pak Suzuki posts staggering losses of Rs6.3b,Reports additional outstanding foreign liabilities of $184m as of December 31,"Pak Suzuki Motor Company (PSMC) has reported a significant loss of Rs6.3 billion, with outstanding foreign liabilities of $184 million, for the year ended December 31, 2022.
According to a notice sent to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Monday, “The company has outstanding foreign liabilities equivalent to $184 million at year end December 31, 2022, which increased to equivalent $218 million subsequent to the year end.”
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Arif Habib Limited (AHL) Head of Research Tahir Abbas explained that, “These are dollar-denominated liabilities that keep growing with the dollar appreciating against the rupee.”
In just one year, the rupee has depreciated against the dollar by around 65% from around Rs175 to about Rs280 to a dollar. “Companies procure their raw material from foreign countries in dollars thus they must pay back in dollars. Due to the country’s situation, however, the company’s liabilities piled up,” said Abbas.
“Up to December 31, 2022, the company incurred an exchange loss of Rs3.55 billion on foreign currency transactions and balances,” said Pak Suzuki, adding that, “After the year end, the rupee to dollar parity has further deteriorated and resulted in a massive unrealised loss of Rs9 billion (approximately) – which may impact the equity of the company in 2023.”
“If the foreign currency liability is not paid due to the restrictions imposed by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the exchange loss of the company would further enhance which will adversely impact the equity of the company in the financial year 2023,” added the statement.
According to a Topline Research report, in its results for the fourth quarter of 2022, the company booked a loss of Rs3.8 billion compared to a profit of Rs489 million in the corresponding period of the previous year. Loss per share (LPS) of the company clocked in at Rs46.5 against earnings per share (EPS) of Rs5.9 in the fourth quarter 2022, taking the full year loss for 2022 to Rs6.3 billion or an LPS of Rs77 per share. “The results came below industry expectations due to higher-than-expected finance costs,” said Sunny Kumar, an Analyst at Topline Research with Insight Research seconding the statement.
“Finance costs, which includes exchange loss, the markup on late delivery, and demurrage and detention charges, were up 14% year-on-year (YoY) and 4% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) to Rs5.0 billion in the fourth quarter 2022 (4Q2022) and up 16% YoY to Rs11.6 billion in 2022,” said Kumar.
Gross margins for 4Q2022 clocked in at 9.8% higher than the 5.2% reported in the same period last year and also higher than the nine months of 2022 (9M2022) margin of 4.1%. According to Insight Research, gross margins were higher possibly due to an increase in car prices, lower freight charges and significant cost-cutting measures.
“Revenues for the quarter improved by 101% QoQ, led by 91% QoQ growth in unit sales of the company. The YoY growth in revenue is primarily due to an increase in car prices,” said Kumar said.
Distribution and marketing expenses were up 15% YoY and 111% QoQ to Rs1,067 million in 4Q2022 which is in line with the increase in volumetric sales.
With the number of bookings declining, the Other Income of the company also depicted a decrease of 37% YoY and 45% QoQ to Rs583 million in 4Q2022. The company has recorded tax expenses of Rs3.4 billion in 4Q2022 vs tax expenses of Rs221 million in the fourth quarter 2021 and a tax reversal of Rs976 million in 3Q2022.

7,CAD drops to $74m in Feb,"Controlled imports improved CAD but slowed economic activities to a near halt, rendering millions of people jobless","Pakistan’s current account deficit (CAD) – the gap between the country’s higher foreign expenditures and low income – hit a two-year low at $74 million, missing the market’s expectation of turning the deficit into a surplus this February.
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reported on Monday that the deficit (CAD) dropped by 86% to $74 million in February compared to $519 million in the same month of the previous year. This was 68% lower than the $230 million recorded in January 2023.
This improvement in the CAD was achieved by limiting imports – to manage with low foreign exchange reserves – and mitigate the high risk of default on foreign debt repayments. The low imports, however, have slow economic activities to a near halt and rendered millions of people jobless in the ongoing fiscal year 2023.
The government is making an effort to revive the stalled International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme to unlock foreign financing worth multibillion dollars and reopen its economy.
Cumulatively in the first eight months (July-February) of FY23, CAD has declined by 68% to $3.9 billion compared to $12.1 billion in the same period last year, according to the central bank. Speaking to The Express Tribune, Ismail Iqbal Securities Head of Research Fahad Rauf said, “The CAD is no longer a problem anymore. It is under control.”
At the same time, he said, “However, we cannot celebrate it (improved CAD), as it has been achieved by administrative controls and not by increasing export earnings or improving the inflows of workers’ remittances sent home by overseas Pakistanis.”
“A large number of factories have shut down either partially or completely due to the non-availability of imported raw material and millions of people have lost their jobs after the government took the much-delayed measures to fix CAD and improve the balance of foreign payments,” he said.
“The government should have taken preventative measures at the end of previous fiscal year and beginning of current fiscal year when the CAD was being recorded at $2 billion a month and the country had notable foreign exchange reserves,” observed Rauf.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL) reported that the primary reason behind the decline in CAD was a 24% drop in total imports in February compared to the same month of the last year. Total exports and workers’ remittances, however, decreased by 19% and 9%, respectively, in the month compared to the same month of the previous year.
“The deficit will continue to remain nominal or may turn into a slight surplus in each of the four remaining months (March-June) of FY23, predicted the analyst. His estimate suggests that the full-year CAD will be in the range of $2-3 billion in FY23.
Currently, Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves stand at an estimated $4.8 billion after China provided $500 million under a rollover scheme last week.

The reserves, however, are barely enough to provide one-month of import cover. In the meanwhile, the country is scheduled to repay foreign debt worth $7 billion in the last four months of FY23.
SBP Governor Jameel Ahmad said the other day that the country is to repay only $3 billion in foreign debt in the remaining months of FY23, while the remaining $4 billion will be rolled over. Like many other analysts, Rauf too was of the view that Pakistan is in dire need of the IMF’s $6.5 billion loan programme. “To avoid a symbolic default, as signs of default have already appeared in the domestic economy in the shape of fast rupee depreciation, high inflation and high key policy rates – we need the IMF loan to be revived quickly,” he said.
“Pakistan’s senior officials should play their due role in convincing friendly countries to issue financial commitments of $6-7 billion, which is the last pre-requisite required for the revival of the loan programme,” he remarked.
FDI inflows
Foreign direct investment (FDI) net inflows, into different sectors of the economy, settled at $101 million in February, compared to $91 million in the same month of the last year – showing an improvement of 11% on a year-on-year basis.
Cumulatively in the first eight months of FY23, the net FDIs inflows dropped by 40% to $784 million compared to $1.32 billion in the same period last year.
China made the single largest investment of $223 million that comes to about 28% of the total inflows in the eight months, followed by Japan at around $13 million (17% of total) and Switzerland with an investment of $123 million (16%), according to an AHL report.
As a whole, power, financial business and oil and gas exploration firms remained the top three recipients of the foreign investment.

8,Dar backtracks on ‘nuclear’ remarks,Insists IMF has not attached any condition relating to nuclear capability,"Finance Minister Ishaq Dar on Monday back-pedaled from his statement about the nuclear programme, saying that neither any country nor the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has attached any conditionality about “our nuclear capability”.
The finance ministry issued a statement on behalf of Dar after Pakistan’s Foreign Office and the IMF denied that the global lender had made any demand about the country’s nuclear programme.
“It is clarified that neither IMF nor any other country has attached any conditionality or made any demand from Pakistan with regard to our nuclear capability,” stated Dar.
Speaking at a special session of the Senate in the presence of foreign diplomats, Dar had said last week that “nobody has any right to tell Pakistan what range of missiles it can have and what nuclear weapons it can have. We have to have our own deterrence.”
Dar was the first finance minister who brought up the issue of the range of nuclear missiles into the public sphere. In private conversations, some Pakistani officials had said that there was a longstanding demand by a Western country to abandon the long-range nuclear missile programme.
Shaheen-III is Pakistan’s long-range missile having the capability to take nuclear warheads to a distance of 2,750 km, covering the whole of India and parts of Middle East.
Dar said that his comments regarding Pakistan’s nuclear programme were in response to a senator colleague’s specific question. PPP’s Senator Reza Rabbani had raised the question about the IMF deal.
“I emphasised that Pakistan has the sovereign right to develop its nuclear programme, as it best suits our national interests, without any external dictation, which by no means should in any way whatsoever be linked with the ongoing negotiations with the IMF,” said Dar on Monday. He said that he was “quoted out of context”.
The finance minister last week emphasised that nobody was going to compromise anything on the nuclear or missile programme of Pakistan. He attributed the delay in staff-level agreement to “technical reasons” but did not give a date when the issues would be resolved.
“The delay in the IMF staff-level agreement is purely due to technical reasons, for which we are continuously engaged with the IMF to conclude it at the earliest,” he stated.
Formal talks between Pakistan and the IMF for the completion of ninth review began on January 31 and ended on February 9. Since then both sides have been trying to bridge gaps without much success.
The IMF has asked Pakistan to arrange an additional $6 billion in foreign loans to remain afloat from now till June. The country’s gross foreign exchange reserves have depleted to $4.3 billion and the IMF’s $1.1 billion is not sufficient to fully finance Pakistan’s debt repayment, estimated at $4 billion for the April-June period, excluding the rollovers.
The IMF’s country head also tried to clear misgivings about the conditions of the $6.5 billion loan programme.
Responding to a query by The Express Tribune about Dar’s statement, IMF Resident Representative Esther Perez stated, “I want to be categoric that there is absolutely no truth to this or any insinuated link between the past and the current IMF-supported programmes and decision by Pakistani government over its nuclear programme.”
The IMF’s country head stated that programme discussions had exclusively focused on economic policies to solve Pakistan’s economic and balance of payments problems, in line with the IMF’s mandate for promoting macroeconomic and financial stability.
Pakistan has been trying to seek the United States’ support to convince the IMF to relax its conditions. But the US too has asked Pakistan to fulfill the conditions instead of looking for any back-channel support, according to sources.
