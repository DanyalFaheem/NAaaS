3,"Naqvi announces JIT, letter to ECP about riots",Asserts police have free hand to maintain order,"Announcing the constitution of joint investigation team (JIT) to probe into alleged acts of terrorism against the Punjab Police, Caretaker Chief Minister Syed Mohsin Naqvi vowed on Monday to write a letter to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), enunciating details of activities beyond the domain of politics that had taken place during the past few days. 
Addressing a press conference, he asserted that the writ of the state and the government would be established at all cost. “If anyone challenges it and raises a hand against the police, they will be crushed,” he warned. 
""I stand with the state, the government and the police. If anyone engages in any activity against the police, they will receive a response that will make them remember it. Enough is enough; the state will enforce its order,” he added.
The caretaker chief minister announced that the police had been given a free hand to maintain law and order in the province and the inspector general had been given complete authority to take decisions after reviewing the situation. 
""The police and Rangers had arrived at the Zaman Park gate twice, but we were informed about the presence of weapons, so I sent both forces back. We do not want to disturb the situation, nor do we want any loss of life,"" he said. 
He regretted that policemen had been beaten up while leaving after duty at night. 
""I had been consoling the policemen for many days, exhorting them to be patient to avoid casualties. The Elite Force’s vehicle was stopped at 1:30 am, weapons were taken away and the van was smashed and pushed into the canal. There are fences on the sides of the canal and it is not an easy task to push a van into the canal. It cannot be done by ordinary people. Some people are involved in terrorism there, and their pictures have been collected. People from outside Punjab are involved in these activities,"" he added. 
Naqvi stated that political parties did not engage in such actions, nor was vandalism a political activity. “Ordinary political workers do not carry out such attacks. How long will the police endure, do their duty, be abused and even be thrashed? Imran Khan threatened the police even yesterday, and the IG and CCPO were named. The police cannot be allowed to be threatened openly,” he said. 
The caretaker chief minister said if someone did not trust the police, then the personnel providing security to him should be sent back. “It is not possible to provide security and then be abused. Security is not possible while beating the police every day. It will not happen that you abuse the police and they protect you.”
He asserted that the personnel had stated that they had search warrants and related messages, but they did not receive a response. He said the police had not entered the residence. 
“We are not ready to pick up dead bodies and we do not want the situation to worsen,” he said.

5,Child help with torture marks rescued,"CP&WB official says victim in trauma, receiving counselling","A 13-year-old female domestic help facing torture and illegal detention by a lady doctor has been rescued from the residential quarters of the Mayo Hospital. 
The victim told reporters that her name was Mehak and she had been employed at the house of the doctor, who reportedly worked in the eye department of the hospital, for the past several years. 
On Monday, she managed to leave the house and reached the quarters of another lady doctor while crying. 
People who had gathered at the spot contacted the Child Protection and Welfare Bureau (CP&WB) after listening to her ordeal.
A team from the bureau reached the spot and took her to its centre. 
The girl was also presented before a court and her custody obtained.
The victim had marks of torture on different parts of her body and she told the rescuers that her employer beat her up over petty issues. 
Child Protection Officer Waseem Abbass told The Express Tribune that the victim was in trauma and was unable to divulge the identify of her parents and their address. 
He said a psychologist had been engaged for counselling her. Permission was also sought from the court for her medical examination. 
Legal action against the employer would be taken on the basis of the medical report.
Over 30 cases of violence against minor workers were reported in the province during 2022 and at least five during the ongoing year.
The child protection official said such victims faced neglect by their parents who received advance money from their employers. 
He added that he had often observed that the employers were well educated, including women, but they consider the child domestic help as their property. 
“Torturing such helpless children is an expression of their dominance that provides them satisfaction,” he added. He added that the majority of the victims as well as perpetrators were female. 
“It is a particular mindset in which only the helpless child is targeted. Such people treat their own and influential people’s children nicely,” he added. 
A veteran child rights activist, Iftikhar Mubarik, said the Punjab Domestic Workers law did not allow children less than 15 years of age to be employed for labour. 
“People who often say that they engage children as domestic help for supporting them avoided employing their parents as they would find it hard to control them,” he said.

6,Rare animals die in Changa Manga fire,"Punjab Wildlife department denies knowledge of cause behind fre, orders investigation","Several rare valuable animals have reportedly died in a fire that broke out in the Changa Manga forest near Lahore.
Sources said hunters started a fire on Sunday in an attempt to flush out deer hiding in the forest, resulting in the death of at least five deer. The Punjab Wildlife department has denied any knowledge of the incident, while the office of the Punjab Forest and Wildlife secretary has ordered an inquiry under the PEDA Act.
Changa Manga forest is a protected area where hunting is strictly prohibited, and many species of animals and birds are kept in enclosures or released into the open environment. However, the lack of new appointments to important administrative posts in Punjab Wildlife has led to a decrease in wildlife care, and incidents of illegal hunting are on the rise. Currently, the positions of Deputy Director Lahore, Assistant Director Lahore, and Sheikhupura are vacant, with the Deputy Director’s seat having been vacant since March 10.

7,Officials told to redress complaints about flour distribution,"CM warns against delay in verification, issuance of bags","Several citizens seeking free flour under the Ramazan Relief Package complained to Caretaker Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Monday about non-verification of their CNICs, low speed of the system employed for the purpose and being asked to return to the distribution point on later days. 
During the caretaker CM’s visit to a free flour distribution centre in Samanabad, some recipients complained of having been told to collect then bags after one or two days.
The caretaker CM took strict notice of the complaints and directed the commissioner and deputy commissioner of Lahore to immediately resolve the issues. He also expressed indignation over giving the beneficiaries later dates to collect the flour.
He warned that such behaviour was not acceptable. 
He directed the officials concerned to provide flour to the eligible beneficiaries present in the centre during the same day.
The caretaker CM inspected the CNIC verification counters and assured the citizens of immediate solution to their problems. “I am personally monitoring the package and the whole provincial administration has been activated to serve the beneficiaries,” he said and added that there had been some problems in the beginning but he had issued orders to solve them.
The Punjab Information Technology Board and NADRA have been asked to improve the CNIC verification process, he said and added that the provincial ministers had also been directed to submit reports after visiting the distribution centres.
Addressing a news conference separately, the caretaker chief minister said the supply of free flour had begun throughout Punjab and thousands of centres had been set up for the purpose.
He said about 100 million people from 15.8 million families would be given 30 kilogrammes of wheat flour free of charge during Ramazan in the province. Around 474 million flour bags will be distributed under the scheme.
“I appeal to people to show patience in case of a rush. All efforts are being made to provide flour to all the eligible citizens who come to the centres and in the next few days the rush will reduce and everyone will get flour as this package will continue throughout the holy month,” he added.
