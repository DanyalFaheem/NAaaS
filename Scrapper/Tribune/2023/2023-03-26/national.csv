0,Russians embrace Chinese cars,"Chinese brands such as Haval, Chery and Geely now account for 40% of new car sales","As the exodus of Western carmakers narrows options for Russian consumers, Chinese automakers are filling the gap, forcing Russians to overcome their reluctance to embrace Chinese brands and stomach higher prices.
Chinese brands such as Haval, Chery and Geely now account for almost 40% of Russia’s new car sales, data from analytical agency Autostat and consulting company PPK showed, up from less than 10% in January-February of 2022, pouncing on the opportunity left by the exit of firms such as Renault, Nissan and Mercedes.
But there are teething problems. Reuters spoke to several Russian car buyers – individuals and dealerships – who perceived the quality of some Chinese cars to be lower than Western rivals and industry experts said Chinese manufacturers needed to enhance their reputation even as their market share soars.
Stepan, 28, who has increasingly driven Chinese cars when using car-sharing services, is among those that need convincing. Among his complaints was the smoothness of the drive.
“I managed to buy a Skoda in 2022. If you want my honest opinion, the difference (with Chinese cars) is massive,” he told Reuters at Moscow’s Favorit Motors dealership.

1,"Germany, EU reach deal on combustion engines",Greenpeace calls agreement a setback for climate protection,"The European Union and Germany have reached a deal on the future use of combustion engines, officials said on Saturday, an issue that has been closely followed by the auto industry.
The agreement will allow some combustion engines beyond 2035 and was quickly condemned by a prominent environmental group.
The bloc and its largest economy had been at odds over the planned 2035 phase-out of CO2-emitting cars, but leaders signalled in recent days that they were close to a resolution.
Germany had wanted assurances that new combustion engine cars can be sold beyond the deadline if they run on e-fuels – a request supported by parts of Germany’s powerful car industry. “We have found an agreement with Germany on the future use of e-fuels in cars,” Frans Timmermans, head of EU climate policy, said on Twitter.
German Transport Minister Volker Wissing said “the way is clear” with the agreement reached late Friday.
“Vehicles with internal combustion engines can still be newly registered after 2035 if they fill up exclusively with CO2-neutral fuels,” he said in a post on Twitter.
Sweden, which holds the EU’s rotating presidency, said EU diplomats will vote on Monday to formally approve the 2035 phaseout law, meaning energy ministers could then give the law the final sign-off needed for it to enter into force on Tuesday, at a scheduled meeting in Brussels.

2,"Banking woes, Fed keep US investors on edge",Banking sector concerns drive sharp moves in financial stocks after collapse of US lenders,"Investors are settling in for a long slog in the US stock market in coming months, braced for more tumult in the banking sector and worries over how the Federal Reserve’s tightening will ripple through the economy.
Banking sector concerns drove sharp moves in financial stocks in the United States throughout the week after the collapse of two US lenders and last weekend’s Swiss government-orchestrated takeover of troubled Credit Suisse by rival UBS.
Many worry that other nasty surprises are lurking as the rapid series of interest rate hikes the Fed has delivered over the past year dry up cheap money and widen fissures in the economy.
“The market is very nervous at this point and investors are acting first and looking into the nuances later,” said Wei Li, Global Chief Investment Strategist at fund giant BlackRock. “It’s understandable because it’s not super clear that this is definitely contained.”
In recent days, investors have focused on German giant Deutsche Bank. The company’s shares have lost around more than a quarter of their value this month, including Friday’s 8.5% fall, and the cost of protecting against a default on its bonds soared, even though few put it in a class with Credit Suisse.
“We are not concerned today about counterparty, liquidity issues” with Deutsche, JPMorgan analysts said in a Friday report.
For now, few investors see this year’s events as a repeat of the systemic crisis that swept through markets in 2008, taking down Lehman Brothers and prompting government bailouts of large financial institutions.
But investors are guarded, wary that another bank run could erupt if people believe US or European regulators won’t protect depositors.
“It’s almost like the prisoner’s dilemma where if everyone agrees that they won’t pull their deposits then everything should be okay, but if just one person decides they are getting out then the snowball keeps growing,” said Tim Murray, Capital Market Strategist in the Multi-Asset Division of T Rowe Price, who is underweight equities, focusing on money market accounts that offer yields comparable to Treasuries.
Uncertainty over the Fed’s intentions is amplifying investors’ hesitation in stocks and sparking huge swings in US government bond prices.
The Fed raised rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday but indicated it was on the verge of pausing further increases. Investors piled into the safe haven of US Treasuries, sending yields on the two-year note, which closely reflects Fed policy expectations, to 3.76% this week, the lowest since mid-September.

3,Court stays proceedings against TRG board,"An ex-employee of Afiniti, testified for an arbitration award against Chishti for sexual harassment and assault","The Sindh High Court (SHC) has stayed proceedings in a district and sessions court in Karachi against the board of directors of The Resource Group International Limited (TRG) in a defamation suit filed by former chief executive officer (CEO) Zia Chishti, the company said in a notice to the stock exchange on Friday.
Last month, a district and sessions judge had ordered the issuance of bailable warrants against various individuals associated with TRG following Chishti’s complaint. A few days later, the SHC ordered the suspension of warrants, followed by the staying of lower court proceedings at a hearing on March 20.
Chishti left TRG in November 2021 after an ex-employee of Afiniti, a TRG portfolio company, testified in a US Congressional hearing for an arbitration award against him for sexual harassment and assault.
The testimony was part of the proposed Congressional bill called “Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment”, which was subsequently signed into law by President Joe Biden in early 2022.
Later in 2022, the US Congress released the full text of the award, with damages of $5 million for the ex-employee and findings of non-consensual assault.
Market sources said that since his departure in late 2021, Chishti had unsuccessfully attempted to come back to TRG and the company’s management had blocked those attempts given the gravity of his actions and reputation.

4,"Balochistan sets wheat price at Rs4,000 per 40 kg",Fixes price at same level as in other provinces to encourage farmers,"Following the directive of Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Abdul Quddus Bizenjo on Saturday, the support price of wheat in the province has been set at the same level as in other provinces.
Now, the support price of wheat has been fixed at a minimum of Rs4,000 per 40 kg. “The objective of this initiative is to increase the production of wheat by encouraging and providing financial support to farmers in the province,” said a statement.
Earlier, Rs6 billion had been released for the food department for the purchase of wheat during the current fiscal year. The provincial finance department would release an additional Rs2 billion for the food department.
Last year, the provincial government had provided free wheat seeds worth more than Rs2 billion to the farmers. Meanwhile, preparations for the timely purchase of wheat by the food department have been completed, the statement added.
For the process, around 23 centres have been established in four zones, which will purchase wheat under the supervision of four deputy project directors and 23 in charges of centres.
According to the statement, a notification for the appointment of project director will be issued by Sunday. Moreover, Section 144 will be enforced from April 1 till the completion of wheat procurement.
Earlier, a news report said that Sindh and Punjab had forced the federal government to raise the wheat support price by setting their own rates, which raised serious concern for the latter.
The Sindh government notified the support/ procurement price of wheat crop 2023 at Rs4,000 per 40 kg on February 9. Later, the Punjab government announced the procurement price of wheat crop at Rs3,900 per 40 kg on Feb 25.
Taking notice of the two different prices, the federal government approved the wheat price of Rs4,000 per 40 kg.
Sources said that the federal government raised serious concern over the different wheat prices, stepping in to set a uniform price to remove hurdles in the way of wheat procurement by Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Services Corporation (Passco) in the two provinces.
In a recent meeting, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet discussed the matter threadbare, observing that there should be uniform price for the procurement of wheat in the country.

5,"Bears dominate, drag PSX below 40,000","KSE-100 index plunges 1,388 points, or 3.36%, at 39,942","Bears held their firm grip over Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) throughout the four-day trading week as investor interest remained weak amid mounting concerns over the economic and political situation in the country.
The week kicked off on a negative note over persistent delay in resumption of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme coupled with the political noise, which dented investor confidence and resultantly the KSE-100 index fell below the 41,000-point mark. The negative momentum continued on Tuesday in a mixed session where no development about reaching a staff-level agreement (SLA) with the IMF hurt investor sentiment.
The market maintained the bearish momentum for two more days and the index dived by over 500 points on Thursday ahead of the monetary policy announcement with investors adopting a wait-and-see approach and expecting a hike of approximately 2% in policy rate.
The index also remained in the red on Friday, the first session of Ramazan, when it dropped nearly 450 points as political chaos and delay in the revival of IMF programme triggered selling pressure in the absence of positive triggers. Resultantly, the bourse dipped below the 40,000 mark.
The KSE-100 index dropped by 1,388 points, or 3.36% week-on-week, and settled at 39,942. JS Global analyst Muhammad Waqas Ghani, in his report, noted that the KSE-100 closed the week in the red as the IMF’s ninth assessment continued to be delayed, which depended on assurances of assistance from friendly countries.
The index closed at 39,942 points, down 3.4% week-on-week, where cement, fertiliser and banking sectors were the major laggards. On the economic front, Pakistan’s balance of payments for February 2023 stood positive at $0.92 billion, as it received $700 million from China.
The positive balance of payments was further bolstered by the minuscule current account deficit (CAD), which contracted to a 24-month low at $74 million, bringing 8MFY23 CAD to $3.86 billion (-68% year-on-year), he said. As a major relief, the government announced a petroleum relief package of up to Rs100 per litre for the low-income citizens. Following that, the IMF sought details of the scheme.
During the week, the government in its T-bills auction saw the rate on short-term papers rise to 22%, signaling expectations of a rate hike in the upcoming monetary policy meeting. Meanwhile, China rolled over $2 billion of SAFE deposits for a year to help Pakistan meet its external financing needs, the JS analyst added.
Arif Habib Limited, in its report, said that in the outgoing week the stock market hovered in the red, mainly because of uncertainty about the resumption of IMF programme. “The government announced a subsidy scheme without consulting the IMF, which can potentially cause further delay in unlocking the next loan tranche,” it said.
As a result, Pakistani rupee depreciated against the US dollar by Rs1.41, 0.53% week-on-week, closing the week at 283.2/$.
Additionally, the Sensitive Price Indicator (SPI) saw a record increase of 45.64% due to a consistent increase in prices of essential commodities. On the political front, the Election Commission postponed the Punjab elections, originally scheduled for April 30, till October 8.
In terms of sectors, positive contribution to the market came from leather and tanneries (5 points) and modarabas (2 points).
Negative contribution came from miscellaneous (210 points), cement (191 points), E&P (186 points), fertiliser (180 points) and banks (173 points). In terms of individual stocks, positive contributors were Service Industries (5 points), Rafhan Maize Products (4 points) and Millat Tractors (3 points).
Negative contributors were Pakistan Services (211 points), Oil and Gas Development Company (87 points), Pakistan Petroleum (79 points), Engro Fertilisers (68 points) and Engro Corporation (61 points).
Foreigners’ buying continued during the week as they bought stocks worth $0.5 million as compared to net buying of $5 million last week, the AHL report added.

6,Exports fall as policymaking becomes rudderless,Businessmen say economic managers lack direction with no consultation with them,"Businessmen are complaining that exports are dwindling and national economic policymaking is rudderless at a time when the country needs to take drastic steps to spur economic growth and ease the sufferings of businessmen as well as ordinary people.
Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) Acting President Suleman Chawla remarked that the team of economic managers lacks direction and the consultative process between the business community and government is non-existent.
“There is an unprecedented long wait before the International Monetary Fund (IMF) deal is revived,” he added.
Reiterating the FPCCI’s stance, Chawla highlighted that compared to the most major economies of the world with a share of more than 70% in regional trade, Pakistan’s trade with regional countries has never taken off and it now seems to be in reverse.
“Despite a dire need, the government has not been able to effectively compress imports and is playing hide and seek with the IMF,” commented Riazuddin, President SITE Association of Industries (SAI), while speaking to The Express Tribune.
“Whereas 75% of our imports are inelastic and cannot be substituted, last year’s import numbers give a picture of how limited our ability to curb imports is without denting the economy,” he said.
According to data, import of mineral fuels including oil was worth $17.1 billion, which was 28.4% of total imports.
Apart from that, import of machinery including computers was worth $6.3 billion, ie 10.4%, and electrical machinery and equipment was valued at $4.3 billion, or 7.2%.
Other imports included iron and steel worth $3.7 billion, or 6.1%, organic chemicals $2.8 billion (4.6%), vehicles $2.6 billion (4.3%), plastics and plastic articles $2.5 billion (4.1%) and animal and vegetable fats, oils and waxes $2.1 billion (3.5%).
“Our exports are also inelastic,” he said. “Even a devaluation of Rs100 in a short span did not result in any growth in exports.”
The SAI president lamented “we do not have a quality exportable surplus” and underlined that with no value addition, high cost of capital, prohibitive cost of doing business, low productivity and efficiency, growth in exports is next to impossible.
“This has been exacerbated by curbs on imported raw material including cotton, which has become scarce after the floods of 2022.”
Chawla said that exports and remittances, which provide foreign exchange for the country, are falling and added that exports to nine regional trade partners have declined by 18.3% in the first eight months of current fiscal year.
“Overall textile exports have declined by 11% with contraction of 30% in February 2023 on a month-on-month basis.”
Chawla stressed that the FPCCI is deeply concerned about the continued decline in exports that is snowballing into a complete nosedive, as exports declined by 3.25% in October 2023, 17.6% in November, 16.3% in December and 15.4% in January 2023.
“This is a systemic decline and needs to be arrested through a broad but effective consultative process,” he said.
The acting FPCCI chief noted that remittances hit a 32-month low in January 2023 with inflows of a mere $1.89 billion.
He added that the country’s foreign exchange reserves would have been near $15 billion currently had the government managed just one aspect of the external inflows namely worker remittances well.
If they had not declined by 20% on a year-on-year basis, it would have been the decisive factor in ensuring the successful conclusion of the IMF’s ninth review.
Chawla maintained that Pakistan’s total reserves are just above $10 billion after accounting for the reserves with commercial banks and the SBP has only $4.6 billion. “SBP’s reserves are what counts,” he added.
Recession in the West and surging energy costs are making exports unviable, remarked Arif Habib Commodities CEO Ahsan Mehanti, adding that the recent floods impacted crop yields and value-added output for exports.
Imports are falling because of a slump in the rupee but falling exports due to the surging input costs are not yielding the net trade surplus, he said.
“The government should facilitate the opening of LCs that allow the import of raw material for value-added exports and control inflationary trend to raise exports.”
The FPCCI president demanded that the government bring transparency and clarity vis-à-vis management of the external account and questioned the reasons hampering the IMF staff-level agreement.
The government should also outline subsequent steps for stabilisation of the economy if the IMF deal is finally struck, he said.

7,Cash margin removal to lift industry,Businessmen welcome scrapping of 100% cash margin requirement,"The Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) on Saturday welcomed the removal of cash margin requirement on the import of goods, terming it a step in the right direction.
In a statement, LCCI President Kashif Anwar, Senior Vice President Zafar Mahmood Chaudhry and Vice President Adnan Khalid Butt said that due to the measures taken by the government and the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to minimise imports, the industry was facing shortage of raw material, machinery and other inputs, which was affecting all sectors.
They said that industries and businesses were also experiencing shortage of funds due to the condition of 100% cash margin but “now the situation will take a positive turn”.
“Removal of cash margin will support ease of doing business. The government should also eliminate regulatory duty, customs duty and additional customs duty on essential raw material,” they demanded.
The LCCI office-bearers stressed that the issues of pending tax refunds and multiple audits should also be resolved besides reducing the rate of withholding tax on businesses.
“Our industries are facing problems like high policy rate, which has reached 20%, and high energy costs, due to which business costs have increased a lot,” the statement said.
“We have always insisted on widening the tax base and suggested to the government to immediately announce a declaration scheme so that the undeclared foreign reserves can become part of our economy.”
Apart from that, they said, taxpayers had to undergo multiple audits of income and sales tax. “We appeal to the government that the number of audits should be reduced.”
Existing taxpayers have to bear the burden of all audits, penalties, surcharges, inquiries, statements, returns, penalty for late filing of statements/income tax returns and many other problems.
“The current situation demands that the rate of penalties and surcharges should be reduced for taxpayers,” the LCCI office-bearers stressed.
As income tax audit was conducted after every four years, sales tax audit should be undertaken as an income tax audit, they suggested and underlined the urgent need for simplifying the tax system.
The LCCI has formulated some important proposals to fix the current economic situation of the country. It has requested the political leaders to share their economic manifesto so that a charter of economy could be drawn up.

8,SBP allows foreign investment in REIT schemes,Amends foreign exchange manual that also permits withdrawal of investment,"Pakistan has allowed REIT management companies (RMC) to attract foreign investment in their projects which include real estate, agriculture, mobile towers and renewable energy through privately negotiated deals before the projects’ units are available for trade at the stock market.
Every Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) scheme is bound to get listed on a stock market like Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) within three years from the date of registration. The central bank has amended the foreign exchange manual to allow REIT companies to invite foreign investment and let investors withdraw investment even in the three years between the date of registration and going live at the PSX.
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said in a circular on Friday that the existing provisions allowed non-residents to invest in REIT schemes listed at the stock exchange and through new public offers.
“In order to further facilitate foreign investment in REIT schemes, in addition to the existing provisions, it has been decided to grant general permission to RMCs to issue their units through private placements and transfer such units in favour of non-residents.”
A couple of management firms have registered around a dozen real estate development and rental schemes worth over Rs600 billion since the authorities amended REIT regulations in June 2021. Besides, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) issued 16 licences for the establishment of RMCs during 2022.
Talking to The Express Tribune, Arif Habib Dolmen REIT Management Limited (AHDRML) CEO Muhammad Ejaz said there was an anomaly. “The latest amendment in the foreign exchange manual has removed the anomaly, allowed foreigners to investment in REIT schemes in those three years that fall between the schemes’ registration and listing at the stock exchange.”
Otherwise, foreign investors, like the local ones, were allowed to invest and divest in REITs while their units were made available for trading at a bourse, he said.
Ejaz stated that everyone was considering approaching foreigners to attract investment, but the anomaly was putting them at bay.
“We may not invite foreign investment immediately amid partial shutdown of the economy…as investors are waiting for the revival of International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme to consider investing in Pakistan.”
Moreover, overseas Pakistanis heavily invest in real estate through remittances, but that could not be repatriated to them earlier. “The latest amendment in the foreign exchange manual allows foreigners to withdraw the investment as well (as practiced through the Roshan Digital Account – RDA).”
Earlier, REIT schemes were limited to the real estate sector. New regulations, ie the Real Estate Investment Trust Regulations 2022, introduced in December 2022, also allowed RMCs to build projects and invite investment in agriculture, mobile towers and renewable energy.
Every REIT project is bound to be fully documented unlike the real estate projects established by non-REIT entities.
So far, only two REIT schemes have been listed at the PSX in the past eight years after the related regulations were announced years ago. The first listing took place in 2015 and the second in 2022.
Management companies say they will get around a dozen REIT schemes listed at a stock market in the next couple of years.
The SBP’s latest amended regulations say the companies issuing shares or REIT funds issuing units, out of new public offers, on a repatriable basis, as permitted, may open foreign currency collection accounts with banks abroad or in Pakistan for receiving subscription in foreign currency.
In this respect, they may also allow refunds from these accounts to the unsuccessful applicants. The amount subscribed by the successful applicants should be repatriated to Pakistan and foreign currency accounts closed within a week of the allotment of shares/ units.
In addition, the original Proceeds Realisation Certificate, as an evidence of subscription money having been repatriated to Pakistan, shall be obtained by the company from the concerned authorised dealer to be submitted to the designated authorised dealer.
In the case of remittance of subscription money directly sent to Pakistan and its payment to the fund’s rupee account (opened in the name of trustee), private funds/ REIT funds may issue units for the rupee equivalent paid by the concerned authorised dealer.
Similarly, in the case of transfer of listed shares and units of funds under the stock broker’s original memo and PRCs in respect of the cost of shares/ units and transfer stamp money may be issued. “Where the sale of shares/ units is negotiated privately, documents establishing the deal and the price of the share/ unit on stock exchange should be furnished on the date of the deal,” it said.
