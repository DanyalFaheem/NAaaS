1,SHO suspended for torturing Hindu shopkeepers,Action taken against officer for using excessive force against minority community's Ramazan Ordinance violation,"The SHO of Khanpur police station of Ghotki district was suspended on Friday following a report that he tortured, harassed, manhandled and arrested Hindu shopkeers for violating Ramazan Ordinance.
In a video that went viral on social media, the SHO Kabil Bhayo is seen roaming in the area with a stick in his hand torturing a few shoppers including Hindu men who were selling Biryani in the local market.
SHO publicly forced the Hindu restaurant owner to take oath under his (Hindus) sacred book. The Hindu man had no other option, but he went inside the restaurant and took an oath.
The SHO arrested more than one dozen people beating them in the market.
Soon after the video went viral, the Sindh Human Rights Commission took notice of it and wrote DIG Sukkur and SSP Ghotki to take action against the police officer. “The act is a violation of fundamental rights of citizens regardless of their religion and beliefs and goes against Article 20 of the Constitution of Pakistan, which guarantees the freedom to profess and manage religious institutions. 
It also runs counter to a landmark judgment by Chief Justice Tassaduq Hussain Jillani on Minority Rights, issued on June 19th, 2014,” the letter issued by Sindh Human Rights Commission Chairman Iqbal Detho said asking DIG Sukkur and SSP Ghotki to probe into the matter with action against the SHO.

2,Injury of man in police firing triggers protest,"Angry mob surrounds police station, vandalise patrol van","A man was injured in police firing in Mubina Town, triggering a protest by angry residents who surrounded the area police station and shouted slogans against cops on Saturday. A committee was formed by the police high-ups to investigate the incident. 
The SHO Mubina Town said that the incident happened when they were conducting snap checking on Abul Hasan Ispahani Road after receiving information about the presence of street criminals in their jurisdiction.
The policemen signaled a man, identified as Usman, to stop, but he tried to escape, on which the policemen opened fire, the SHO mentioned, adding, the suspect was arrested in an injured condition. Later a mob surrounded the police station and vandalised it. 
On the other hand, residents of the area contradicted the police version, claiming that Usman was not a street criminal. They were angry that instead of shifting the injured Usman to hospital the police put him in lockup.
The enraged protesters besieged the police station, broke windows of a police van and shouted slogans against police. Police resorted to aerial firing to disperse the protesters.
Later, SSP for District East Zubair Nazir reached the police station and negotiated with the protesters to end their protest. The protesters dispersed after SSP Nazir formed a committee to investigate the whole episode. ""If the policemen are found at fault, a case will be registered against them,"" he assured the protesters.
Injured Usman was later handed over to the protesting citizens to shift him to hospital for medical aid.

Speaking at a conference held at the JI headquarters on Saturday, the JI leader expressed disappointment on the ECP's role in facilitating the PPP government.
Rehman stated that instead of examining the Form 11 and 12 of the six union councils, the ECP ordered a recount under the supervision of Returning Officers (ROs) and District Returning Officers (DROs) who were responsible for post-poll rigging. 
The JI had informed the ECP that the results of polling at 66 stations were changed, and the commission had promised to summon all returning officers for the hearing, he said.
Rehman further added that the commission had also announced exemplary punishment for those ROs and DROs responsible for changing the results.

9,Encroachments: an unending nuisance,"KMC, DMCs, ACs, police, political figures allegedly patronise mafia","Encroachments are causing serious problems in the metropolitan city where lack of urban planning has already made it virtually unlivable. It is becoming nearly impossible for pedestrians and motorists to make their way through illegally set up stalls, cabins, pushcarts, and other obstructions on roads and sidewalks. 
The Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), District Municipal Corporations (DMCs), assistant commissioners, police, and traffic police are allegedly helping the mafia. Political figures are also allegedly involved in these unlawful activities.
The problem is widespread. The entire roadside from North Karachi's Nagan Chowrangi up till Surjani Town's 4K Chowrangi, including footpaths, are filled with pushcarts, stalls, cabins, and other structures, causing problems for residents. Sir Syed Town and Khwaja Ajmer Nagri are particularly affected, with local police allegedly collecting extortion on a daily basis from the owners of pushcarts, stalls, and cabins.
It is not limited to these areas. The area between Sector 11C and B Amma Park in North Karachi has been held hostage by pushcarts mafia which has taken over the entire stretch of road. They have put up piles along the road at such a point that the residents have to face severe difficulties while turning the vehicle. And if they are asked to remove the obstructions, they say very boldly that no one can remove us as we pay extortion money regularly to KMC, DMC and local police on a daily basis.
Residents in District Central North Karachi report that concerned institutions only take action when they want to, stating that crackdown is being undertaken on court orders. A few days ago, Assistant Commissioner North Nazimabad cleared boards and sheds from the shops. However, he could not see scores of other encroachments, such as pushcarts, cabins and stalls on roads, footpaths, and neighborhoods. These encroachments cause significant problems for citizens and disrupt the flow of traffic.
The residents of the area have demanded SSP Central that the connivance of the police in the establishment of encroachment should be traced, and a joint strategy should be adopted with the relevant authorities to eliminate encroachments on public spaces. They hope that a solution can be found so that they can get rid of the difficulties and hardships they are facing due to encroachments.
