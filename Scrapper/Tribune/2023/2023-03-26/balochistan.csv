The commissioner went on to say that policy guidelines given for these projects should be followed according to the law and timely completion should be ensured by using quality materials, he added.
“Timely completion is essential to make projects effective as delays cause hardship rather than convenience.”

During the briefing, it was informed that 640 schemes worth Rs273,482 million have been allocated for the division under the annual development programme. Of these, 405 are currently under way while 235 are new.

Officials said around 303 schemes were sanctioned for the Rawalpindi district, out of which 123 are new and 180 are under way.

However, in the last month of the previous year, the then Rawalpindi commissioner approved the inclusion of 558 public welfare projects under the Annual Development Programme 2022-23.
According to the spokesperson of the district administration, a review meeting of annual development schemes was held in December 2022 under the chair of the then commissioner Saqib Manan wherein he directed that the deputy commissioners concerned to monitor the progress of different development schemes and ensure quality construction work in their respective districts.
