0,Sana lampoons Imran for ‘paradoxical narrative',Interior minister asks PTI chief to first get ‘freedom from US lobbying firm’,"The ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz ministers have fired a broadside at Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan, saying that “traitorous patriots and agents working against Pakistan” should not be allowed to hold a rally at ""a revered place like Minar-e-Pakistan"" and be arrested.
Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah said in his statement that Imran should “first get real freedom from the American lobby firms … from ‘I am not afraid of America’ to ‘my life is in danger’ and from the lie that ‘America did not conspire’ new lies will emerge”.
He said that Imran wanted real freedom from the Constitution, law and truth. “Imran wants real freedom from Toshakhana, prohibited funding, and Tyrian White cases. Imran wants real freedom to make every institution and its head his slave,” the minister said, adding that the whole nation had already seen the scenes of his true freedom at D-Chowk.
The interior minister said that he looted the country and sought real freedom. “Visibly, Imran has a fight with America, but from within, they are brothers.”
Sanaullah said, “This traitorous person is using a revered place like Minar-e-Pakistan for his lies. Imran is the top liar of Pakistan and an agent working against Pakistan who should be arrested at Minar-e-Pakistan where the gathering should not have been allowed in the first place.”
He said, “The condition of the people would have improved if this person who spread sedition in Pakistan through foreign funding did not get a free pass.”
Separately, Minister for Information Marriyum Aurangzeb took a dig at the prime minister, saying Imran should tell the participants of the rally at Minar-e-Pakistan about his “forbidden foreign funding, Toshakhana gifts theft, and Tyrian White”.
Using her Twitter handle, the minister said Imran should tell the nation about his four years of misrule which plunged the country into unprecedented inflation, unemployment, and destruction.
The minister said that a person who looted the country and pushed it into the mire of destruction and division, cannot salvage it as “he is only a fraud and a terrorist”.
She said, “The real freedom narrative which started from the [taunts] of neutral animals, the indefinite extension offer to the then Army Chief General (retd) Bajwa came all the way to implicate Shehbaz Sharif and Mohsin Naqvi’s role in his [Imran’s] ouster, and finally concluded at seeking pardons from the United States.”
She said the narrative of real freedom “has been buried and its funeral is being held tonight”.
The time has come for the nation to get real freedom from the “instigator terrorist”, she maintained.

1,Russia to deploy tactical nukes in Belarus,ICAN warned of nuclear strike last month on first anniversary of Russia Ukraine war,"Russian President Vladimir Putin said Saturday he would deploy tactical nuclear weapons in neighbour and ally Belarus.
Putin has repeatedly issued thinly veiled threats he could use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, reviving Cold War-era fears.
He also said he would deploy depleted uranium ammunition if Kyiv received such munitions from the West following a British suggestion that it could supply Ukraine.
""There is nothing unusual here either: the United States has been doing this for decades. They have long placed their tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of their allies,"" Putin said.
Putin said he spoke to Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko and said ""we agreed that we to do the same.""
On the question of how Moscow would respond if the West supplied Ukraine with depleted uranium shells, following a suggestion by Britain it could supply Kyiv with the munitions, Putin said Russia had vast quantities of the weaponry.
""Russia of course has what it needs to answer. Without exaggeration, we have hundreds of thousands of such shells. We have not used them yet,"" Putin added in an interview on Russian television.
The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) has warned nuclear threats were creating a dangerous sense of uncertainty around their possible use.
The longer Russia's operation in Ukraine grinds on, the greater the nuclear strike risk, ICAN warned last month ahead of the offensive's first anniversary.
Putin announced last month that Moscow would suspend its participation in New START, the last remaining arms control treaty between the world's two main nuclear powers Russia and the United States.
NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg slammed Russia for suspending the nuclear weapons limitation treaty with the US, saying it marked the end of Europe's post-Cold War arms control architecture.
The announcement came after Moscow last August suspended US inspections of its military sites under New START.
Putin previously said at a Kremlin meeting that ""such a threat is rising"" on the use of nuclear weapons but has been evasive on Russia's policy.
US officials have voiced fears that Russia could use nuclear weapons if it feels routed on the battlefield and could plant a fictitious story to justify its actions.
Russia has already spoken of supposed Ukrainian attempts to detonate a ""dirty bomb,"" drawing strong denials from Ukraine and a sharp rebuke from the United States, which had rare direct communication with Moscow to warn against nuclear use.
Neither the United States nor Russia -- by far the largest nuclear weapons powers -- officially has a policy of no first use of the ultra-destructive arms.
A recent US posture review by President Joe Biden concluded only that nuclear weapons should only be used in ""extreme circumstances.”

2,PM Shehbaz terms Alvi's letter seeking polls 'PTI's press release',Shehbaz says president violating oath of his office," 
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday responded to President Dr Arif Alvi’s letter by saying that it not only exposed his blatant partisan nature but read like a press release of the PTI, the political party the latter was affiliated with.
President Alvi had written a letter to PM Shehbaz on Friday emphasising that he should direct all the executive authorities concerned with federal and provincial governments to assist the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in holding the elections in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa within the constitutional timeframe.
In his response to that letter, the premier accused the president of openly supporting PTI’s anti-government views in violation of his oath and office.
He added that Dr Alvi had also acted in a similar partisan manner on several occasions in the past in violation of his oath.
“I am constrained to express, at the outset, my disappointment at the blatantly partisan nature of your letter, which in parts reads like a Press Release of the Opposition political party, i.e. the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI),” the premier responded to the president's letter.
PM Shehbaz continued that Dr Alvi had continuously been espousing the PTI’s one-sided, anti-government views, notwithstanding his constitutional oath and the office of president.
The premier pointed out that these occasions included the president’s order for the dissolution of the National Assembly on April 3, 2022, on the “illegal” instructions of then premier Imran Khan – a decision that was later declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court on April 7, 2022.
Secondly, PM Shehbaz maintained that the president had failed to discharge his constitutional duty in terms of clause (5) of Article 91 to call upon him when he assumed the office of the prime minister and swear him in.
“The only reason I am responding to your letter is because I want to bring your partisan attitude and actions on record and to set the record of our government straight,” the premier wrote.
Writing on the issue of the elections, PM Shehbaz claimed that the president had given the dates for the polls in Punjab and K-P at the behest of the PTI, adding that the decision was set aside by the Supreme Court on March 1, 2023.
“You have not raised any concerns on the malafide dissolution of the Provincial Assemblies of the two provinces, that too at the behest of and to satisfy the ego of the Chairman, PTI,” PM Shehbaz continued.
The premier maintained that the two provincial assemblies had been dissolved not for any constitutional or legal objective but to blackmail the government in the Centre and the other two provinces.
He added that the sole objective of the PTI’s move was to force the government to dissolve the National and the other two provincial assemblies.
The PM wrote that the president had not taken note of the effect of conducting polls in Punjab and K-P prior to the general elections for the National Assembly in as much as conducting free and fair elections under clause (3) of Article 218 might not be possible with elected governments in the two provinces.
“This constitutional distortion has completely escaped your attention, which is quite saddening, given the role of the head of the state that the Constitution assigns to the president,” the premier added.
In addition, PM Shehbaz wrote that the ECP had announced October 8, 2023, to be the new date for the polls in Punjab after taking into account the ground realities, saying all federal and provincial governmental authorities furnished the relevant information to the electoral watchdog.
He added that being the constitutional body charged with the duty to organise and conduct elections, it was ultimately the ECP’s decision to assess whether the circumstances were conducive for conducting free and fair polls as required under clause (3) of Article 218.
“I do, however, wish to point out that you did not object to the use of language and the rather aggressive attitude of the federal ministers of the previous government, who actively attempted to undermine the authority and credibility of the ECP,” the PM added.
In his letter, the president had also highlighted human rights abuses by the authorities -- mainly against the PTI chairman and his party activists -- and asked PM Shehbaz to take notice of them and ensure remedial measures as well as preventive action.
In response, PM Shehbaz while simultaneously accusing the president of actively working towards undermining a constitutionally-elected government and objecting to the tone and language of the letter, wrote that Dr Alvi's reference to the alleged violations of fundamental and human rights of politicians as well as political activists was quite clearly in reference to those belonging to the PTI, a party he himself belonged to.
“I want to state in categorical terms that the substantive and procedural due process guaranteed under the Constitution, under Articles 4 and 10A, is being afforded to all,” PM Shehbaz claimed, adding that all actions taken by the law enforcement agencies were strictly in accordance with the law to maintain law and order as well as to establish the writ of the state.”
Moreover, the premier wrote that in nearly all instances, the people aggrieved by the legal action taken against them had approached the appropriate legal forums
“Regrettably and ostensibly due to your party allegiance, you [president] have failed to note the sheer violation of laws, contumacious disregard of court orders, attacking the law enforcement agencies, damaging public property, attempts to create chaos, civil and political unrest and in short, to bring the country to the brink of economic default and civil war, by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI),” PM Shehbaz continued.
“Mr President, what has really ‘tarnished the image of Pakistan in the international community and is casting negative repercussions on the future of democracy and state of human rights in the country’ is the complete disregard of the laws and the Constitution by the PTI,” the premier claimed.
PM Shehbaz further wrote that the president had not, on any occasion, “uttered even a single word regarding the conduct of Mr Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi, Chairman, PTI on his actions in response to lawfully issued court orders for appearance in criminal proceedings”.
The premier added that “never in our history have we ever witnessed such an aggressive, rather militant, attitude of a political order in complete defiance of court orders”.
He claimed that the PML-N-led government had ensured that there remained complete freedom of speech and expression, as enshrined under Article 19 of the Constitution, subject only to reasonable restrictions permissible under the provision.
“Regrettably again, you [president] never raised your voice or shared your concerns in the manner that you have in your letter in the past while the PTI was in power,” he added.
PM Shehbaz said he wished to draw the president’s attention to the Human Rights Watch's (HRW) annual World Report 2022, which covered the year 2021 when the PTI government was in office.
The premier, while quoting the HRW report, wrote that the PTI-led Pakistan government had “intensified its efforts to control the media and curtail dissent, authorities harassed and at times detained, journalists and other members of civil society for criticising government officials and politics. Violent attacks on members of the media also continue”.
PM further referred to a report by Aljazeera published on January 14, 2022, on the annual World Report 2022 issued by the HRW, with specific reference to the chapter on Pakistan.
He noted that the report had pointed out that the previous government kept the National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR) dysfunctional for the most part of its tenure.
Quoting the report, the premier noted that the PTI-led government had deliberately obstructed the appointment of the members and chairperson of the NCHR only because it had issued a damning report on the state of human rights under its regime.
PM Shehbaz continued that there were several reports of international human rights organisations that reflected poorly on the track record of the previous government on severe violations of human rights and the fundamental rights of the citizens of Pakistan.
“All of this, unfortunately, escaped your [president] attention,” the premier added.
Moreover, he maintained that the president did not raise any concerns when the previous government carried out a witch-hunt against the opposition, claiming that a fabricated and false narcotics case, entailing the death penalty, was registered against PML-N leader Rana Sanaullah, then an MNA.
He added that male and female members of parliament of other opposition parties were subjected to the worst kind of political victimisation by making false cases against them during the PTI tenure.
He claimed that even a female member of the family of a former premier was not spared, solely to politically eliminate them.
He added that the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) was used to tame the political opposition and dissent.
“Unfortunately,” he wrote, “you [president] never raised your voice.”
The premier further wrote that the Constitution did not vest any powers in or assign any functions to the president whereby they could seek an explanation from the government or the prime minister.
Responding to the president’s reference to Article 46 of the Constitution and Rule 15(5)(b) of the Rules of Business, 1973, through which he arrived at the conclusion that there ought to be meaningful consultation between the president and the prime minister, PM Shehbaz wrote that the “conclusion is, with great respect, out of place”.
“Mr President, in the exercise of your functions, you must act on and in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet or the PM under clause (1) of Article 48,” he noted.
In very limited instances, PM Shehbaz highlighted that the president acted at his discretion under the Constitution.
“Article 46 and Rule 15(5)(b) supra are what they ordain. That is, keep the president informed. Nothing more and nothing less,” he wrote.
The premier added that these provisions or for that matter nothing else in the Constitution required the prime minister to consult the president on the exercise of executive authority by the federal government.
“I am fully aware of my duties and the duties of the federal government under the Constitution,” PM Shehbaz finally told President Dr Alvi.
The premier assured the president that the government was fully committed to preserving, protecting and defending the Constitution and ensuring that the fundamental rights guaranteed to the citizens of Pakistan were not violated.
""However, our government is also determined to ensure that no one is allowed to violate the law, create unrest and attempt to cause irreparable harm to the state of Pakistan. I want to further assure you that our government will thwart any efforts to undermine the constitutionally elected government,” he concluded.

3,Maryam turns her guns on LHC,PML-N leader claims to have damning evidence against its judges,"PML-N Senior Vice President Maryam Nawaz on Sunday claimed that she had damning evidence with her about the Lahore High Court that would reveal how decisions were given in favour of PTI Chairman Imran Khan on the requests of sons-in-law and children of its judges.
The LHC had recently granted protective bail to the former premier in nine FIRs registered against him, including eight filed on terrorism charges.
He was granted bail relief in five of them lodged in Islamabad till March 24 and the remaining four in Lahore till March 27.
The LHC later extended the period of protective bail in the five FIRs registered in Islamabad till March 27 as well.
Maryam, while addressing a group of lawyers that was broadcast by the state-run TV channel, criticised the superior judiciary for allegedly according preferential treatment to the PTI chief.
Read Shehbaz blames Imran for nation's present challenges
She said the PML-N believed that elections were a way forward and was not scared of them as it was not “selected” like others, referring indirectly to the PTI.
However, she added that prior to elections, a fair judicial system and political stability was required in the country.
Maryam claimed that the reason why elections were postponed in Punjab was the decision of the Supreme Court wherein it had allegedly rewritten the Constitution.
She was referring to the decision of apex court where it had disregarded the votes of the MPAs cast against party policy, resulting in her cousin Hamza Shehbaz losing his post as the Punjab chief minister.
The PML-N leader, who is the daughter of party supremo Nawaz Sharif, further said the SC’s decision was a stain on the face of judiciary.
She, however, did not explain how that verdict had any impact on the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) decision to delay the elections in Punjab.
Maryam maintained that former National Assembly deputy speaker Qasim Suri was declared a violator of the Constitution.
However, she added that he was still allowed to go scot-free by the court.
“This puts a big question mark on our judiciary as people are imprisoned for decades for a petty crime but the violators of the Constitution are allowed to walk free,” she added.
The PML-N leader said her government not filing a petition against Suri was its weakness, demanding that it should proceed with the move.
Referring to the SC's suo motu notice over the delay in Punjab elections, Maryam described it as a controversial move.
She added that the notes of Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi on which the suo motu proceedings were initiated as well as the bench formed to hear the matter were controversial too.
She said whoever spoke about the shortcomings of courts was threatened with contempt proceedings.
“In reality, the contempt of court is committed when a corrupt judge is protected even when evidence emerges of him being compromised and yet action is not taken against him,” she added, referring to the recently surfaced audio leaks.
Maryam questioned what guarantee was there that Imran would have accepted the election results under the PML-N-led federal government and caretaker Punjab Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi’s tenure if they were held on their earlier scheduled date of April 24.
She pointed out that the PTI chief had accused the caretaker Punjab CM of having hatched a conspiracy to murder him.
Maryam further said how elections could be held on the whims of Imran, who was “always under influence of drugs”.
She said the claim that elections were to be held in 90 days was a selective reading of law, asking where in the Constitution was it allowed to conduct polls under elected governments.
The PML-N leader claimed there should be a caretaker set-up for the entire government for holding the elections.
She added that the PTI’s lecturing on the rule of law was nothing short of a joke as “it was the first party to be declared a violator of the Constitution”.
Maryam alleged that Imran was launched by foreign forces to spread anarchy in the country.
She asked the lawyers' community to name and shame Imran’s “facilitators”.
The PML-N leader maintained that Imran’s “facilitators” were still within the system.
She added that Imran’s politics revolved around crutches.
Referring to an alleged interview of Gen (retd) Qamar Javed Bajwa -- which he later denied giving -- Maryam maintained that the former army chief, who brought Imran to power, had revealed that the PTI chief was a dangerous man.
She claimed that the ex-army chief had also revealed how decisions were made on the instructions of judges’ family members.
Maryam said on the day of the Panamagate judgment, the family members of judges were present in the court.
She maintained that the family members of the judges had expressed their joy on their social media handles over the decision even before it was announced, proving that what Bajwa was allegedly saying was true.
Maryam claimed that Imran had repeatedly flouted the law by evading court hearings on one excuse or the other.
She added that when he finally decided to show up, he came with a mob, which attacked the court.
Despite all this Imran was given bail by the dozens, she continued.
Maryam said she and her father attended over a hundred hearings in frivolous cases but never showed their contempt.
Referring to the statement of Imran’s aide Sheikh Rashid, she maintained that the PTI’s politics revolved around appointments.
“Their [PTI] long march was to intercept the appointment of the army chief,” she claimed.
“Now they have shifted their focus towards October keeping in view another appointment,” she continued.
Maryam maintained that all the cases against Imran were genuine, be it Toshakhana, Tyrian White or prohibited funding.
She added that if Imran had nothing to hide, he should appear before the courts to answer for his deeds.
