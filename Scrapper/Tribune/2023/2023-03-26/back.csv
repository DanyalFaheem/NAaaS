8,Professionals struggle with higher costs,Analysts predict inflation to rise to at least 35% a month in March and April,"Naureen Ahsan earns more than twice the average wage in Pakistan, but the school administrator says she has no choice but to homeschool her daughters and delay their London-board certified final exams because she can't afford their education.
Like most people in the nation of 220 million, Ahsan and her husband, who owns a car servicing business, are struggling to cope with a surge in living costs triggered by the government's devaluing the currency and removing subsidies to pave the way for the latest tranche of an International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout needed to stave off economic collapse.
Pakistan is no stranger to economic crises - this is its fifth IMF bailout since 1997 - but economists say the latest measures, which include higher taxes and fuel costs, are hurting educated professionals. Many say they are cutting down on necessities to make ends meet.
""We don't eat out any more,"" Ahsan told Reuters. ""We no longer buy meat, fish. I've cut down on tissue paper and detergent. We don't see friends, we don't give gifts. Occasionally, we scream at each other.""
The government-mandated minimum wage is about 25,000 rupees, but with inflation at a record 31.5% in February, its highest rate in nearly 50 years, many people who earn much more than that say their salaries do not last the month.
Abhi Salary, one of Pakistan's biggest fintech firms, which allows its 200,000 or so subscribers to withdraw wages in advance, says transactions have increased by more than a fifth every month for the last three months. Most people spend two-thirds of the money on groceries as they rush to stock up before prices rise again, Abhi CEO Omair Ansari said.
""Unfortunately the poor in Pakistan are left with nothing to lose,"" said Abid Suleri, the Sustainable Development Policy Institute of Pakistan, an economic think tank. ""Educated professionals... find their purchasing power and savings eroded, and daily consumption either unaffordable or out of reach.""
Ramazan, which began this week, is likely to add to price pressures in Muslim-majority Pakistan. Analysts predict inflation to rise to at least 35% a month in March and April.
During the holy month, Muslims traditionally break their daylong fast with special foods and at large family gatherings, culminating in the Eid al-Fitr festivities. This year, for many people, Ramazan means more belt tightening.
""We're cutting down on the number of meals and the food,"" said Ahmed, a senior manager at a multinational company who declined to give his family name because he was worried about possible backlash from his employer. ""It will be more difficult to buy sweets and gifts for Eid, which is a break from our family tradition.""
The economic turmoil is driving some professionals out of the country. Khaliq, a doctor who also didn't want to be give his full name because he was embarrassed by his financial situation, said he and his wife, who is also a doctor, work as much as they can to save up for exams to qualify them to work in Britain.
""We think twice about eating out or using the car,"" he said, adding that the weakening rupee was making the cost of their exam, which is in British pounds, higher by the day. ""We plan to pass the exams and move out ASAP.""

9,Pakistan calls for trans-boundary water cooperation,UN report warns Pakistan faces critical levels of water security,"The UN 2023 Water Conference has wrapped after a breakthrough response to the global water crisis, with governments, businesses and civil society making almost 700 commitments to advance the water agenda, a dealmaker for accelerating sustainable development overall.
Pakistan on Thursday stressed the need for trans-boundary water cooperation, citing the 1960 Indus Water Treaty with India as an example of such successful cooperation that provided an effective mechanism to deal with issues related to the shared water resources.
Hasan Nisar Jamy, Water Resources Ministry Secretary and Pakistan’s chief delegate, told the UN Water Conference at the United Nations in New York that Pakistan shared surface and groundwater resources with two neighbouring countries.
“Within the South Asia region, population growth and increasing water demand, coupled with climate change impacts and ecosystem degradation, has made water cooperation even more imperative,” Jamy told the general debate.
“The Indus Waters Treaty, which governs sharing of the Indus basin’s waters, is one example of such successful cooperation, which provides an effective mechanism for cooperation and management on water issues,” Jamy added.
The conference, the first in almost five decades, aims at dealing with the water-related challenges. Speaking on the penultimate day of the three-day event, Jamy warned against unilateral actions, which could “spiral into threats to regional peace”.
Pakistan is among the top 10 water scarce countries in the world, and has also been among the top 10 climate vulnerable countries. Jamy stressed that Pakistan’s main water resource was highly sensitive to climate change.
On ‘Water Governance’, Jamy said that a policy was currently being implemented with focus on the construction of new reservoirs, improving water use efficiency, ensuring conservation and improving management.
“We have also started to formulate and promulgate ‘Ground Water Regulations’ and establish supportive authorities at the provincial and sub-national levels,” the chief Pakistani delegate added.
At the conference, The UN University Institute for Water, Environment and Health (UNU-IWEH) issued a new ‘Global Water Security 2023 Assessment’ report,  bracketing Pakistan in the list of 23 least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS) facing critical levels of water security and sanitation services.
The UNU-IWEH said in the report that these 16 LDCs and seven SIDs were also marked by high water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)-attributable mortality rates.
The 23 countries include Pakistan, Afghanistan, the Solomon Islands, Eritrea, Sudan, Ethiopia, Vanuatu, Djibouti, Haiti, Papua New Guinea, Somalia, Liberia, St Kitts & Nevis, Libya, Madagascar, South Sudan, Micronesia, Niger, Sierra Leone, Yemen, Chad, Comoros and Sri Lanka.
“These countries are severely impeded from achieving water security in seven of the 10 components; low levels of access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation services, health, measured by high WASH-attributed mortality, water quality, water value, water governance and water resource stability with high interannual variability and low storage capacity,” the report said.
The report assessed 57 countries in the Asia-Pacific – 11 SIDS and 10 LDCs – with a total population of over 4.67 billion, including Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Afghanistan, Vanuatu, Timor-Leste, Pakistan, Cambodia and Yemen.
The report recalled that in 2022, unprecedented rainfall and flooding in Pakistan affected approximately 33 million people, with estimates of total damages exceeding $14.9 billion and total economic losses reaching about $15.2 billion.
“Beyond losing human life, the safety of an economy from losses due to water-related disasters can have a major influence on all aspects of development and countries prosperity,” the report warned.
“Without water security, countries are simply incapable of supporting freshwater ecosystems, livelihoods and human well-being,” Dr Charlotte MacAlister, the report’s lead author and senior water security researcher at the UNU-INWEH, said.
“This global assessment highlights significant development challenges that policy discussions should centre on in the seven years left to fulfil SDG 6,” MacAlister said, according to a statement issued by the UN.
UNU-INWEH Director Prof Kaveh Madani noted the value of this first global outlook of water security as “a major contribution” to the UN 2023 Water Conference that took place from March 22-24 in New York.
“While not an easy undertaking, this research identifies where we should target policy, funding, and action to accelerate progress, meet the 2030 Agenda and ensure that the most vulnerable and insecure are not left behind.”
