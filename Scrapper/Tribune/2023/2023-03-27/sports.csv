2,Textbook distribution in govt schools delayed,Students left in limbo ahead of new academic year,"Thousands of government school students in the province are yet to receive free textbooks because of a delay in their distribution ahead of the new academic year.
According to sources, the Punjab Textbook Board had been asked to provide 50.1 million books before the start of the academic year. However, the board has so far provided only 30.2 million textbooks to the Programme and Implementation Unit of the Punjab School Education Department.
School education department officials told The Express Tribune that in addition to the remote areas, free textbooks have also not been given to thousands of students admitted to various grades.
Sources in the textbook board alleged that publishers awarded tenders to provide the books had failed to complete the task by the deadline.
The school education department is reportedly facing problems in planning to begin the teaching in the new academic year due to the unavailability of the books, causing anxiety among the parents of the students of government schools.
The sources said the department had received complaints from almost all districts of Punjab that the distribution of free textbooks among the students had not been completed. The process has not even been started in some remote districts because of the unavailability of the free books.
The academic year is scheduled to begin on April 1 across the province and the school education department is responsible to provide free text books to its 48,000 schools in all districts.
“According to the procedure, the Punjab Textbook Board hands over the free textbooks to the Programme Monitoring and Implementation Unit of the Punjab School Education Department, which then distributes the books among the chief executive officers (CEOs) of all district education authorities,” a senior official of the department said.
The officers are responsible to distribute the books among the schools in their districts as per requirement.
The CEOs form teams led by the district education officers and all deputy DEOs to distribute the free textbooks among the government schools.
The official said the department had advised that the textbooks should be handed over by April to all government school students enrolled this year. However, the books had not been provided and this was the reason that thousands of students had not yet received the books,” he added.
“The process of book distribution has started in Lahore and other big districts but the procedure is slow because we were not supplied the number of books as per our demand,” the education department official said.
“We have not received the completion report of the textbooks’ distribution from any district so far and maybe we will not be able to distribute the books by April 1 if the higher authorities in the Punjab government would not take action to resolve the issue as we have a shortage of millions of books,” he added.
The official said the department had also given the task of the officials in the districts to admit more students to the schools and a campaign had been launched to improve the literacy rate in Punjab, but the efforts in this regard would be affected if the students were not given free books.
Punjab Teachers Union secretary general Rana Liaqat Ali said the distribution of textbooks among the students in Lahore was under way but the process might have been slowed down by heavy rains during the past week.

3,"Standing crops damaged by hailstorms, rain","Wheat and cotton crops on 16,000 acres of land affected","Secretary Agriculture South Punjab Saqib Ali Ateel said that around 16,000 acres of standing crops were affected by poor weather in Layyah district. He expressed these views during a visit to Layyah, where he assessed the impact of recent rains, wind and hailstorms on various crops and vegetables, including wheat.
He directed the field staff to complete a survey of losses caused by rain and to submit a report as early as possible. He further added that the wheat crop has now entered an important stage in its growth and directed field formations to remain present in the field to guide farmers. The Secretary said that the sowing of other Kharif crops, including cotton and mango orchards, entered a key phase across South Punjab and added that field formations need to work diligently.
Ateel said that the next generation could be saved from the damage of climate change by planting trees, adding that growers suffer a great deal and their hard work is often wasted due to climate change. The Punjab government was providing financial protection to registered farmers under the insurance scheme.
Secretary Agriculture further added that serious steps were being taken to increase cotton cultivation and production, with a special insurance policy for cotton crops launched to ensure profit for farmers. He ordered field formations to convince farmers to increase cultivation of cotton crops and spread awareness about its importance so that cotton could be cultivated across the maximum possible area.
Meanwhile, Secretary Agriculture South Punjab Saqib Ali Ateel chaired a meeting reviewing the performance of the Agriculture department and inspected the bio lab.

5,Two Bahawalnagar men ‘commit suicide’,Unemployment lead victims to take extreme step,"Two young men committed suicide within the city on Sunday.
The first incident was reported in Anandpur, a suburb of Bahawalnagar, where 30-year-old Majeed reportedly hanged himself to death.
A resident of Anandpur, Majeed ended his life due to domestic poverty and unemployment, claimed police sources, who concluded that a poor financial situation motivated him to take his own life.
Meanwhile, another youth disillusioned with his domestic and financial situation committed suicide. According to sources, Abdul Aziz allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself.
In a similar manner to the first case, he reportedly committed the act due to unemployment and poor domestic conditions.
Police sources claimed that Aziz was mentally ill and under treatment for some time, while on the other hand, residents of the area stated that Aziz, a husband and father, was very worried about his finances due to unemployment, implying that he committed suicide due to the non-availability of labor and work. Local police began legal action into both cases.

A motorcycle and weapons were also recovered from the possession of the dead “robbers”, they said.
According to the police, the two robbers had already had eight cases registered against them.
Police shifted the bodies to the Allied Hospital mortuary for postmortem and mounted a search operation to arrest the absconders.
Police also filed a case under various provisions against the deceased robbers and their absconding accomplices.
The City Police Officer announced cash prizes and certificates for the SHO and other employees who participated in the encounter.
Police, while giving a detailed account of what transpired, said that five bandits erected a barricade near Chak No. 58 GB within the limits of Garh Police Station and robbed a person of his belongings and then tied him with a rope and dumped him in a wheat farm.
They said that the victim somehow managed to report the incident to Rescue 15.
After receiving the information, the SHO of Garh Police Station, Inspector Rana Mazharul Haq, along with ASI Amir Farman and other personnel, arrived at the spot.
When the alleged bandits saw the official vehicle, they opened fire on the police personnel indiscriminately.
As a result of bilateral firing, two alleged bandits, Lal alias Lalu, and Abid sustained injuries.

7,Unfulfilled obligations : Transgender community endeavours to perform Umrah and Hajj,Many still do not possess X category CNIC and passport,"While in most countries, the transgender community is being openly integrated into all realms of socio-political life, the one in Pakistan still struggles to perform fundamental religious obligations.
Despite the introduction of the Transgender Act of 2018, which attempted to integrate transgender persons into the society, a majority in the provincial capital is still unable to undertake religious pilgrimages to Saudi Arabia since obtaining an X category CNIC has turned out to be a heavily complicated affair, given the societal barriers and social stigma that non-binary citizens are faced with in the country’s overall ethos.
While a group of transgender persons did perform Umrah recently, a vast majority consider the prospect of travelling abroad for religious pilgrimage, utopian to say the least.
“How can we perform Hajj or Umrah when a majority of us cannot even obtain an X category CNIC, given the social stigma surrounding non-binary gender identities in our country,” informed Zanaya Chaudhry, a trans rights activist.
Such trans phobia which prevents transgender persons from obtaining X category CNIC and performing their religious duties, usually originates from the families of non-binary people, who refuse to accept the identification of an intersex or transgender child as anything other than male or female.
One such case is of Jannat Ali, a renowned trans woman from Lahore, associated with the performing arts, who resents experiencing the ostracization that transgender members of a family are subjected to. “If a child musters up the courage to reveal their true gender identity to their parents, either they convince him or her of falsely identifying as male or female or they simply banish the child from their house,” lamented Jannat.
Since a majority of the transgender persons have been abandoned by their families and are residing in communal arrangements with the guru as their household head, many activists have suggested allowing the guru to be officially registered as the father, thereby allowing trans persons with broken kinship ties to be issued an X category CNIC so that they may perform the religious pilgrimages.
However, the barriers that prevent transgender persons from fulfilling their religious obligations are not limited to their families. According to various members of the transgender community, traveling to the gulf countries including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), is extremely challenging for transgender persons, who anticipate either being declined a visa or being deported.
As Zanaya Chaudhry, a trans rights activist, who revealed her true gender identify on her passport, shared, “I was declined a UAE visa because my passport identifies me as a trans woman.”
Privy to such discriminatory treatment by visa issuing bodies, many trans persons have started registering themselves as male or female in order to sail through immigration. This, however, rarely helps much since many trans persons report deportation when airport security discovers their false gender identity on their passports.
Furthermore, many activists claim that one reason behind the discriminatory attitude towards Pakistan’s transgender community is their lack of representation in the census which is the direct by-product of very few coming out and revealing their true gender identity for registration by NADRA.
Where the trans rights activists continue their struggle for garnering greater representation and social accessibility for their fellows, various sources holding Islamic credentials, criticize the Transgender Act of 2018 for violating Islamic principles since it allows citizens to determine their own gender, and can lead to the normalization of homosexuality, which is prohibited by the Sharia.
“While we support welfare efforts aimed at improving the living condition of the transgender community, we reject the Transgender Act of 2018, which is un-Islamic and must be amended in accordance with Islamic injunctions,” said Qibla Ayaz, Chairman of the Islamic Ideological Council.
