0,PML-N’s ‘bench fixing narrative’ vindicated: Maryam,PML-N leader hails order of two SC judges that object to unfettered powers of CJP,"PML-N Senior Vice President and Chief Organiser Maryam Nawaz hailed on Monday the order of two judges of the Supreme Court who questioned the unbridled powers of the top judge of the country on constituting benches, among other things, saying it was a “victory” of PML-N’s narrative about “bench fixing”.
The Sharif family scion was referring to Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail’s order through which they not only raised objections on the unfettered powers of the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) on taking suo moto notice but also expressed that making benches by the CJP alone to hear cases was nothing but a “one-man show”.
“Justice Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Mandokhail’s decision today is a victory for our narrative about bench fixing,” the PML-N leader said while presiding over a meeting of party’s spokespersons, asking “if the bench-making is not fair, how the decision can be considered fair”.
The term bench-fixing has usually been viewed as match-fixing as often people are able to predict the outcome of cases even before the court rulings in the cases concerned.

Also, the phenomenon once again came under spotlight as people on social media started using the term “like-minded judges” for the judges who usually give decision in favour of a particular political party.
Maryam’s remarks have come after Justice Shah and Justice Mandokhail issued a 27-page order on Monday, stating that the suo motu case regarding the Punjab and K-P elections date announcement was dismissed by a majority of four judges out of seven.
The two judges aimed to “revisit the power of the one-man show enjoyed by the office of the Chief Justice of Pakistan” in order to “strengthen” the institution and “ensure public trust and confidence” in the apex court.
During the party spokespersons’ meeting, Maryam directed them to “expose Imran Khan’s facilitators in judiciary with full force,” saying that the alleged violation of the Constitution and the law applied in ex-premier Nawaz Sharif’s cases shall be fully exposed.
“If there is justice, all the evidences coming in favour of Nawaz Sharif should have been enough to level the scales of justice by now,” Maryam said.
During the past few weeks, Maryam and PML-N leaders have been objecting that the scale of justice was not equal for the PML-N and PTI, saying “two standards of justice in one country are not acceptable”.
Key decisions in spokespersons’ meeting
During the meeting of PML-N spokespersons, Maryam along with party leaders decided that they would bring “unfair and vindictive judgments” against former premier Nawaz Sharif and testimonies that later came in his favour to the public.
Among other decisions, a party statement said that a strategy had been prepared to bring the facts about former premier Imran and his alleged facilitators before the public.
The meeting decided to expose the alleged corruption by the PTI chief and his facilitators.
“Truth should be told to the nation without any pretension,” Maryam directed the party spokespersons, saying all the characters who facilitated Imran and his party should be exposed.
Maintaining that the PTI chief was now “past”, the PML-N chief organiser said that the party should now think about the future of the country.
The meeting decided to convey facts regarding the party policies to the people.
Referring to Imran’s tenure as premier, Maryam asked the party spokespersons to apprise the people how the country was destroyed during the last four years.

The PML-N senior vice president alleged that the PTI chairman wanted to divert public attention from his corruption cases, saying irrefutable evidence against him was available in different cases, including Tyrian White, foreign funding and Toshakhana cases.
“Economy was destroyed during the last four years. Not even a single job out of 10 million as promised [by the PTI] was offered and not a single house out of the five million committed was given to the public by the Imran-led government despite making a pledge before the 2018 general elections,” she said.
Lashing out at the PTI and its 10-point agenda given during the Minar-e-Pakistan rally, Maryam said the former ruling party had only “one-point agenda which is to loot [the country]”, further noting that Imran had “uttered 10 lies” at the Lahore public gathering.
The PML-N leader stated that a false agenda was being propagated by the PTI again recalling that the party had come to power with the slogan to root out corruption from Pakistan within 90 days but the country’s score had fallen by 14 points during the former ruling party’s rule.

1,Pakistan deliberates on SCO participation in India,"Barring one event, Pakistan has attended all other events via video-link","Pakistan has begun in-house consultations to decide whether to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meetings of the defence and foreign ministers in India.
New Delhi has already extended invitations to Defense Minister Khawaja Asif and Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari. The defence ministers’ meeting is scheduled in April in New Delhi while foreign ministers would meet in May in Goa.
India being the current president of eight-nation SCO is holding a series of events. Barring one event where Pakistan was denied entry over map controversy, Islamabad has attended all other events, including chief justices’ conference and meeting of energy ministers via video-link.
However, a three-member Pakistan military delegation headed by a brigadier attended the meeting of an expert working group under the Council of Defence Ministers in-person in New Delhi on Thursday.
The presence of Pakistani delegation in New Delhi has raised the possibility of defence and foreign ministers traveling to the neighbouring country.
While the Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson insisted that the final decision would be taken closer to the events, sources said that in-house consultations are already underway.
The authorities are currently divided over attending the high-profile meetings. One view is that given the current state of relationship Pakistan, if required, only junior officials could be sent to the SCO meetings. But the others do not agree with this. They believe that Pakistan must not leave such key regional forums unattended, and since SCO comprises powerful countries, including Russia and China, Pakistan must use this opportunity to advance its interests.
Sources said that a lot will depend on China. If China, being the founding member of SCO that played a key role in making Pakistan its full-time member, asks Islamabad to attend the meetings it would be difficult for the government to ignore the advice.
Pakistan and India were accepted as full members of the SCO after both sides committed not to undermine regional focus by bringing up their bilateral issues.
Given this in mind it would be extremely difficult for Pakistan to stay away from the SCO gatherings altogether.
Sources said that Foreign Minister Bilawal was keen to go to India for the SCO meeting. If Pakistan attends the defence and foreign ministers’ meetings. it is possible that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif may also go to India in July for the SCO summit.
The relationship between Pakistan and India remains at a standstill despite efforts in recent times to normalise ties. If Pakistan sends a high-powered delegation to India for SCO, it may break the ice though it may not bring any dramatic change in the bilateral ties.
Sources said the final decision about Pakistani participation in SCO ministerial meetings and a summit would be taken after due diligence. It would also depend on the political situation in Pakistan, they added.

2,MQM-P threatens to hold own census,Says its reservations over digital count coming true,"The MQM-P’s Rabita (Coordination) Committee on Sunday announced that if there were errors in the statistics of the ongoing 7th Population and Housing Census in the country, the party would conduct its own head count.
During a huddle of the MQM-P’s Rabita Committee, presided over by the party’s convener Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, sources said the participants discussed a range of issues including the country’s political situation, census and local government by-elections.
The party expressed its grave concerns over the process of the country’s first digital census, observing that its reservations over the exercise were coming true.
It was pointed out that the census staff had failed to reach several areas.
The participants of the meeting further maintained that in many areas, several people living in the same building had been counted as a single individual.
They added that in their meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, they were assured that this issue would be addressed.
Earlier this month, on the MQM-P's demand, the prime minister had ordered to extend the census from three to 10 days and to mark each flat instead of the main entrance of multi-storied buildings.
In February, the party had written a letter to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) chairman, saying that allocating only three days for conducting the census in the densely-populated Karachi was not enough.
The letter had read that at least 10 days should be set aside for household head counts.
It had added that the number of days should be increased for the three phases of national household and digital censuses.
The party had also warned that any count of Karachi population below 40 million would not be acceptable to it.
The sources said the MQM-P had conveyed its reservations over the census to the premier as well as the chief commissioner of the exercise, the PBS chairman.
They added that the party had given a clear message to the federation that it would not back down from its stance on the census and repeated that it was its red line.
According to the latest PBS figures, the census of 23.6 million houses had been completed by Sunday across the country.
It added that it had finished the counting of 140 million people.
The PBS said overall, 61% of the census had been completed.
It continued that the entire exercise in the country would be achieved by its scheduled time of April 4.
In the MQM-P meeting, most members of the committee supported the participation in the by-elections for local government seats, observing  that party's position in connection with the delimitation of constituencies had been proven to be correct.
They noted that the MQM-P had won its case with the addition of 53 union councils and it should participate in the polls now.
The sources said a decision in this connection would be made in the coming days.
Earlier this month, the Sindh local government and housing town planning department had announced the addition of 53 new union councils to the Karachi division -- meeting a longstanding demand of the MQM-P.
After the addition, the number of union councils in the city has increased from 246 to 299.
However, the new union councils would become functional after the next local government elections.
This means the next mayor of Karachi would be elected by the representatives of the 246 union councils in the city.

5,Imran gets interim bail in seven cases,IHC issues notice to govt over former premier's security concerns,"The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday granted Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief Imran Khan interim bail in seven cases, restraining authorities from arresting him.
Chief Justice Aamer Farooq heard the former prime minister’s plea seeking protective bail in cases pertaining to clashes between the PTI workers and police personnel during his appearance before Federal Judicial Complex on March 18.

Senior PTI leaders Fawad Chaudhary, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Asad Umar, Sabtain Khan and party lawyers were present in large numbers inside the courtroom.
The former premier sought interim bail in seven cases over security concerns. Imran was accompanied by his two senior lawyers, Naeem Panjotha and Salman Safdar.
During the hearing, Chief Justice Farooq questioned why the petitioner was trying to bypass the trial courts. Counsel Safdar stated that the former premier faced security threats.
Justice Farooq stated that law and order situation arose when thousands of people gathered outside courts, however, Imran's lawyer argued that people came to the court on their own accord and were not summoned by the PTI.

The lawyer continued that on March 18 they were at the judicial complex but were not allowed to enter. He added that Imran's counsel would assist the court on events outside the trial court.
The judge remarked that the events that conspired on March 18 were wrong, and the court was aware that Imran faced potential threats.
Islamabad Advocate General (AG) Jahangir Jadoon stated that the PTI must cooperate with security authorities. He said that on March 18, the former ruling party brought up to 5,000 people and the door of the judicial complex was broken.
AG Jadoon maintained that it was the PTI's responsibility to control their followers, to which the IHC CJ questioned what the party was to do when the authorities were not providing them with security.
""Imran Khan has genuine security concerns,"" the chief justice said, adding that the former premier had been attacked in the past.
Imran's lawyer stated that in all the cases against him, the police were the plaintiff. He continued that he had ""no objections"" to going to the judicial complex if proper security was provided.
The lawyer added that security personnel were removed from around Imran.
Justice Farooq told the AG that he had ""done wrong by removing the former premier's security"".
The chief justice stated that he would pass an order on the matter, granting Imran interim bail in seven cases. He sought answers for why a former prime minister's security was withdrawn.
The court also issued a notice to the incumbent government.
Earlier today, the IHC adjourned a hearing requesting the provision of details regarding cases registered against the PTI chief.
Chief Justice Farooq heard the case, and Imran’s lawyers complained about difficulty in reaching the court. The judge stated that he had to come through the same route and security was arranged for the PTI leaders.
During the hearing, the federal government requested extra time to provide information.
The court adjourned the hearing till Tuesday, ordering the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and the Islamabad police to inform it about the number of cases pending against Imran.

PTI leaders Umar, Murad Saeed, Aamir Kiyani, Shibli Faraz and Ali Amin Gandapur were some of the leaders that were summoned.
In a separate development, the Islamabad police reportedly attempted to arrest Ghulam Sarwar Khan. However, he managed to escape along with his caravan. The police reportedly picked up the official photographer of the deposed prime minister, Naumanji.

6,Imran not interested in polls: Marriyum,"Says PTI chairman does not have political issues, rather he was facing psychological problems","Minister for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb said on Sunday that PTI Chairamn Imran Khan was not interested in elections in the country but wanted his selection as premier again.
Addressing a news conference in Lahore, the information minister said that the PTI chief’s ‘foul plays’ of cypher, long march, elections, Zaman Park, attacks and threats to the courts had reached their conclusion.
She said people remember Imran’s tenure as a ‘black chapter’ in the history of the country as they were paying the price of his four-year ‘misrule’ which was marked by corruption, incompetence and inefficiency.
The PTI chairman does not have political issues, rather he was facing psychological problems, she said.
She said last year Imran had concocted the fake narrative of foreign conspiracy for toppling his government which was accepted by followers.

7,Pakistan stands vulnerable to a ‘severe’ locust attack,The aerial spray wing of the Plant Protection Department is completely inactive,"Pakistan is currently vulnerable to a severe locust attack, which could cause significant damage to the country's agricultural sector and threaten food security.
The Plant Protection Department of the federal government, which was responsible for controlling the spread of locusts, was facing a major setback as 18 aircraft that were previously used for aerial spraying to neutralise locust attacks were now inactive.
The Plant Protection Department had procured these aircraft for tens of millions of rupees, using them for aerial spraying in various regions.
However, in 2021, one of the aircraft crashed in Rahim Yar Khan, and since then, all the planes had been grounded. Currently, 10 of the aircraft were stranded in Karachi, while eight in Lahore, and it was feared that lack of proper maintenance had caused further damage to the planes.
The Plant Protection Department's air fleet consisted of Beaver, Cessna, and Fletcher aircraft. The Fletcher and Cessna aircraft fleet was grounded in 2004, and the Beaver aircraft fleet in 2021.
The aerial spray wing of the Plant Protection Department became completely inactive due to the grounding of the planes, leaving the country vulnerable to locust attacks.
Pakistan faced its worst locust outbreak in nearly three decades in 2020-21, which caused severe crop yield reduction or even total failure in many areas. The desert locusts affected 38% of Pakistan’s land area, leading to significant damage to food crops, including wheat, maize, and vegetables. The locusts damaged over three million hectares of crops, resulting in losses of around $3 billion, according to the Pakistan Agricultural Research Council data.
In response to the locust crisis, Pakistan collaborated with China to control the locust attack, but these latest revelations exposed the authorities’ preparedness to deal with the situation.
The looming threat of a severe locust attack in Pakistan's primary food-producing regions had the potential to inflict significant damage on the agriculture sector. The devastation of locust swarms could be profound, as they were equipped with an insatiable appetite that could sweep through green fields, leaving a trail of destruction in their wake.
In the absence of effective measures to control their spread, farmers were faced with the perilous prospect of an infestation that could potentially wipe out entire crops, thereby posing a severe threat to food security in the region.
Locusts, a species of grasshoppers, could inflict extensive damage to crops and vegetation when they swarm in large numbers. The challenge of controlling these pests was compounded by their ability to travel vast distances and reproduce rapidly.
While pesticides remained the most effective method of control, they had detrimental effects on the environment and human health. Consequently, there had been a surge in interest in biological control methods that involved introducing natural predators or pathogens to target locusts without causing collateral damage to other species.
Moreover, early warning systems and vigilant monitoring could detect locust outbreaks and allow for timely and targeted intervention. Therefore, a combination of different strategies and a coordinated effort among nations and organisations was vital to mitigate the impact of locusts on agriculture and food security.
