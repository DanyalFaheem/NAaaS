2,SIU nabs suspect for peddling fake notes,Says probe expanded to hunt gang operating from Peshawar,"Counterfeit currency notes have been in circulation in the metropolitan city which are hard to detect even with the help of ultraviolet (UV) light, revealed a suspect taken into custody by the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) in connection with fake currency smuggling.
The suspect was taken into custody during an operation for alleged involvement in inter-provincial smuggling of fake currency notes.

3,MQM-P deplores power outages in Ramazan,MNAs hold HESCO bosses responsible for incompetence of ground staff,"The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) has decried power supply cuts by Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (HESCO) in Ramazan.
Despite it being the fasting month, HESCO has shown no let up in the power outages, saidMQM-P MNAs from Hyderabad Sabir Hussain Qaimkhani and Salahuddin.
They said that the consumers run from pillar to post with the complaints of faults in the transmission system but their grievances remain never heard.
The utility takes weeks to replace burnt and damaged transformers, they deplored. They lamented that not only the unscheduled outages and long hours of scheduled load shedding traumatise the people, the unjustified bills and detection further add to their problems.
The MNAs blamed the higher officers of HESCO for being responsible for the disappointing performance of their staff. They said the officers sit in their air conditioned rooms all day and that they are least bothered about the troubles faced by the consumers.
The MNAs asked why a centralised one window service for correction of the bills is not being initiated despite repeated suggestions.
The MNAs also complained about gas load shedding and low pressure which is continuing even in Ramazan. According to them, they are receiving complaints from the citizens about low pressure or gas outage during Sehri and Iftar times. They asked the top officers Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) to take notice and address the problem. They blamed HESCO for making the people pay for the incompetence of its staff by causing outages and delivering unjust bills to their consumers.
The HESCO staff always invented excuses to justify the miseries being caused to the consumers, the MQM-P lawmakers said, adding, people are being forced to run from pillar to post though it is a matter of a fault in a transformer or the transmission system or the correction of wrong bills.
They deplored that neither a solution to the power theft was being found nor the problem of extended hours of scheduled load shedding, which was based on the line losses criteria, was being resolved. The MNAs said the summer season was on the horizon but no steps had been taken to upgrade the transmission system and demanded that the HESCO should drastically reduce the scheduled and unscheduled outages and the consumers’ complaints pertaining to wrong and detection bills should be addressed on priority.

5,Badin agriculturists decry corruption in irrigation dept,"Funds to repair watercourses, LBOD not properly utilised, farmers say","The political, social and farming circles of Badin have expressed deep concern over the alleged corruption of millions of rupees annually in the Sindh Irrigation and Drainage Authority (SIDA).
Pakistan Thereek-i-Insaf (PTI) Badin President Azizullah Dero and Advocate Ram Kohli have accused officials of the Sindh government and local officials of the water department of misappropriating funds meant for repair and maintenance of waterways.
Local famers including Lala Nawaz, Atta Chandio, Mian Shakeel Arain, and Badshah Jamali pointed out that SIDA gets billions of rupees annually but in spite of this there were no repairs made to the Left Bank Outfall Drain (LBOD), Paran River embankment and other small and large culverts in the coastal and flood-hit areas of Badin.
They say that broken and damaged watercourses were among the chief reasons why flood water could not be drained even seven months after the exponential rains and the flood.
Leading farmers of Badin, Mir Noor Ahmed Talpur and Malak Akhtar Awan, while talking to The Express Tribune said that encroachment on the natural passage of Paran River caused flood destruction in the area. Obstructing the flow of the river caused the river to break its banks and inundate the district, they said.
As always, this year also Sindh Minister for Irrigation Jam Khan Shoro had inaugurated the project for the construction and repair of LBOD and the restoration of Doro Paran, a natural passage of water, which will cost Rs5 billion, they said adding that billions worth of funds are dumped into LBOD and other sewerage schemes each year without any results.
They have demanded of the Sindh government to ensure desilting of waterways and removal of encroachment and squatters from river bed before the rains.
Prominent community leaders Piroz Shahani, Abdul Shakoor Nahriu, and Bashir Ahmad Notakani said that as per law no one can own the riverine land, the maximum limit of the river bank. Hence it is up for grabs for powerful people who even shelter robbers and criminal elements to secure their illegally acquired land, they said.
The urged the government to mobilise the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and the Sindh Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) to identify and prosecute people grabbing riverine lands, locally known as katcha areas.
Expressing doubts if the government will actually act against the people grabbing kutcha lands, they said the only hope was that the chief justice of Pakistan takes suo-moto notice on the issue.
Constructions in the way of water flow have led to devastating floods, they said accusing government officials of taking heavy commissions and bribes to turn a blind eye on encroachment on the river bed.
The chief justice should establish a commission and conduct an inquiry against those involved as well as those responsible for SIDA, they demanded.

6,Transportation troubles : KU students left drained as shuttle services fall short,Many forced to walk long distances during Ramazan,"With summer approaching and Ramazan already begun, the student body at the University of Karachi (KU) anticipates physical exhaustion due to limited shuttle services leaving many with no option but to walk long distances on campus.
Where intra-department strolls alone during the scorching summer heat are enough to dehydrate the average fasting student, those from KU are left drained. Students have to walk kilometres in order to reach their departments because of restrictions placed by the university on the operation of shuttles.
“Ever since the university announced the operation of limited shuttles on campus, hundreds of students, including myself, have to walk from one department to the other,” complained Aamna Ali, an Islamic Studies student.
According to sources, in recent times, KU has restricted the operation of shuttle services on campus and has only allowed their usage during fixed time slots of the day, citing the petrol hikes as an excuse.
This comes as a bombshell for the thousands of students, faculty and academic visitors, who frequent the campus during various times of the day and have to walk to reach their respective departments in case their detour falls outside the specified shuttle operating time.
“My department is located at the main road near Metroville Gate and the shuttle service stops working after 9:30am. It is not available during my class timings,” revealed a pharmacy student.
The students of Computer Science, Mass Communication, and Applied Economics face the same conundrum. They are unable to find shuttles near their departments after 10 in the morning - even though the official shuttle schedule clearly states the operation of vehicles during the morning hours up until 10:30am at various gates including Metroville, Maskan, Sheikh Zayed, and Silver Jubilee.
Some sources have blamed the university administration for purposefully creating a shortage of shuttles on campus claiming they were in cahoots with rickshaw drivers. Indeed, multiple rickshaw stands can be spotted on campus with each driver charging the fare that they fancy, further fueling the suspicion of the critics.
Apart from rickshaws, private shuttles also operate in KU but they are few and far in between while the prices are steep for students. “The private shuttle charges Rs 20 per student and has only eight buses. How can 45,000 students be accommodated in 8 buses,” questioned one irked student.
In his response to the outcry of students resenting the unavailability of ample shuttles, a grade-16 officer, Dildar Khan, had an amusing response: “Buses have to visit the workshop for regular maintenance checks, several times a day, and hence are unavailable for the students.”
Such controversy surrounding the functioning of the shuttle service is, however, not a novel occurrence. Last year, too, the university administration had come under public scrutiny for purchasing eight new shuttles but still depriving the student body of their services by choosing to keep them safely parked on campus premises. However, it is not just the new shuttles that are sitting idle. The Express Tribune learnt that out of the 41 buses parked on its premises, KU only has eight that are functional.
As the daily plight of students continues, Dildar Khan attributes increased fuel prices as a major reason behind the university not allowing most of the shuttles to fully operate. “Our fares are just Rs10 per student, and with petrol prices rising exponentially, we have no choice but to limit the operation of these shuttles in order to monitor our expenditures.”

7,A waft of attar in the holy month,"Stalls, kiosks pop up as demand for traditional fragrance surges","The cramped and narrow lanes that lead to the aptly-named Botal Gali (Bottle lane) in Karachi's downtown is home to a variety of smells, from perplexing to downright noxious, unless you enter one of the shops selling attar.
Attar is an oily perfume, therefore without alcohol, which has its origin in India and the Middle East, and known as the oldest perfume in the world. Of Arabic etymology, the term attar (also written atr, ittar or othr) could be translated by ""scent"". It is known to elevate the mood and have a therapeutic effect, with its first known concoctions used for medicinal purposes.
It is immensely popular among Muslims, particularly in the holy month of Ramazan. There are nighttime congregational prayers (Taraveeh), communal meals as well as other activities. Muslims prefer to put on new clothes and wear attar, a natural perfume extracted from flowers.
Pure attar, a fragrant essential oil extracted from flowers, is very expensive and hence a luxury for most. But now low-cost fragrances made by mixing various essential oils with chemical ingredients are within the reach of everyone.
Temporary kiosks and stalls selling perfumes pop up near attar shops in different markets of the metropolitan city as the sales shoot up in the holy month. Such stalls are also set up outside mosques to grab the attention of worshipers. The sales are particularly high after Zuhr and Asar as well as Taraweeh prayers.
Karachi has seen a rapid increase in the demand for alcohol-free perfumes over the past few years. The most popular among these attars are gulab, motia, henna, khas, shamama, oud, saffron, musk, and amber. Common alcohol-free perfumes are easily available in the range of Rs400 and Rs800, while top international attar brands are much more expensive.
Botal Galli, or Bottle Street, situated at Lighthouse, has become the biggest perfume and attar market not just in Karachi but in Pakistan. A huge variety of local and international fragrances, including attar and alcoholic perfumes, are manufactured using chemicals imported from China and India, and sold in retail and wholesale markets on the street.
Shopkeepers in this market, the most popular fragrances among customers include CK One, Havoc, One Man Show, Clement, Blue Lady, Marjan, Black X, Ambassador, Royal Marriage, Romance Super, Fantasy, Safari, Brute, etc. Most of these names are similar to popular international brands.
Other major perfume sales centres in Karachi are located in Bolton Market, Jama Cloth Market, and on MA Jinnah Road. Interestingly, some of these business pre-date Pakistan.
Among these are shops on the main road adjacent to Maulvi passenger station near Jama Cloth Market. ""Heads of state from other countries, including the king of Saudi Arabia, and important government and political figures of Pakistan used to be our customers,"" recalls the owner of Kanauj Attar House located in Jama Cloth Market.
Experts say that alcohol-free perfumes often contain dangerous chemicals, such as placebo oil, carbon monoxide, acetone, linalool, and benzene, which could cause diseases such as cough, cold, flu, allergy, headache, sore throat, and eye irritation.
However, those who practice Greek medicine (Tibb-e-Unani) say that natural fragrances, attar in particular, have been used for their remedial properties since ancient times. Gulab and kewra attar can relieve conditions such as heart palpitation, nervousness, and mental fatigue.
The price of attar, distilled from pure ingredients, has gone up exponentially and has become unaffordable for the average citizen. Therefore, chemical perfumes became widely popular due to their affordability. The price of 100ml pure attar is in the thousands, while chemical perfumes are available for a few hundred rupees. The recent inflation has made pure attar even more expensive while the prices of chemical fragrances have also registered an increase.
