0,Election delay case eclipsed by two judges’ surprise order,CJ Bandial observes ECP has ‘gone little off track’,"Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial on Monday said that “it [the Election Commission of Pakistan] may have gone a little off track, but it can be brought back”, ordering it to “come prepared to assist [the court] on the legal questions and the factual points raised in the [PTI] petition”.
The top judge’s remarks came amid fissures within the ranks of SC justices, as two judges called for revisiting the power of the “one-man show” enjoyed by the chief justice, saying that the country’s top court could not “be dependent on the solitary decision of one man”.
Moreover, the chief justice sought to enlist the help of political parties with a view to restore calm in the country, saying free and fair elections could not be possible without their cooperation.
“All political parties should give an assurance that they will cooperate in holding free and fair elections,” the chief justice said.
The remarks came as a five-member top court bench took up a politically explosive petition filed by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, seeking direction for the poll supervisor to stick to the already announced schedule for the Punjab election.
Headed by the chief justice, the bench comprised Justice Ijazul Ahsan, Justice Munib Akhtar, Justice Aminuddin Khan and Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail.

At the outset of the proceedings, the court, while issuing notices to the Federation of Pakistan, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and the governments of Punjab and K-P, ordered the ECP to explain the legal and factual questions raised in the PTI petition on Tuesday (today).
“We cannot interpret the Constitution in a vacuum,” remarked the top judge, adding that the court only “needs an assurance that the elections will be held in a transparent manner”.
The apex court chief justice said that the electoral watchdog “is just an institution”. “The elections are important for democracy but they can only be held in a conducive environment.”
He questioned the ECP’s authority to annul the date of elections given by the president. “Instead of amending the schedule, can it wipe out the schedule?” the chief justice asked.
He said, “Article 254 of the Constitution cannot condone the wrongdoing which is referred by the ECP.”
The chief justice noted that “there is a viewpoint that elections should be held in the country only when there is peace and order”, noting that elections should be free, transparent and fearless.
“What are our politicians doing to bring stability to the country? Justice Bandial remarked. “This is a very disturbing situation.”
Justice Munib Akhtar said that the ECP’s decisions had become an “obstruction” in the way of the apex court’s orders.
Justice Mandokhail raised questions on the maintainability of the petition. “Why the petitioner did not approach the high court for the implementation of the order,” Justice Mandokhail inquired.
He also asked, “Where is the order of the court in suo motu case regarding the announcement of the date to hold elections.”
However, Justice Akhtar said, “All five judges had signed the short order.”

Counsel for the PTI, Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, while presenting his arguments, said that the apex court in its March 1 orders had instructed the ECP to decide on a date for elections in Punjab and K-P.
“On March 8, the ECP issued the schedule for elections in Punjab, whereas the K-P governor did not announce a date for the polls,” the PTI lawyer said.
He contended that the electoral watchdog had thrice committed violations, explaining that the ECP had rejected the election schedule announced by the president.
Zafar said that the electoral body had now delayed the elections till Oct 8, arguing that “it did not have the authority to give a new date for the polls”.
“The Election Commission has violated the 90-day period [for announcing the date of elections]. As per the Constitution, the ECP did not have the right to change the date [for polls] or extend the 90-day deadline,” he said, stressing that the ECP “overlooked” the court’s orders.
Justice Mandokhail asked, “What do you want from the court?”
Barrister Zafar replied that the petitioner wanted the SC to ensure the implementation of the Constitution and its own orders.
“The execution of court orders is the responsibility of the high court,” Justice Mandokhail replied.
Meanwhile, the PTI lawyer said that if the reason for the delay in polls — as given by the ECP — was accepted, “elections will never take place”.
“The matter did not just concern the court’s orders. The matter of elections in the two provinces cannot be heard by one high court,” he reasoned, adding that the SC had earlier used its authority on the matter and still had jurisdiction over it.

Justice Akhtar said that the ECP’s decision had become “an obstruction in the orders of the SC”.
“Only the Supreme Court can decide better whether the orders are violated or not,” the judge observed.
The petition 
The petition, moved by PTI Secretary General Asad Umar, Punjab Assembly Speaker Mohammad Sibtain Khan, K-P Assembly Speaker Mushtaq Ahmad Ghani and former lawmakers of Punjab Abdul Rehman and Mian Mahmoodur Rashid, pleaded that the ECP’s decision was in violation of the Constitution and tantamount to amending and subverting it.
In the petition, the PTI sought directions for the federal government to ensure law and order, provisions of funds and security personnel as per the ECP’s need to hold the elections.
It also requested the court to direct the K-P governor to announce the date for elections of the provincial assembly. Last week, K-P Governor Ghulam Ali also proposed Oct 8 as the date for holding the elections in the province. Earlier, he had announced May 28 as the date for polls.
In the petition, the PTI questioned the ECP’s authority to “amend the Constitution”, asking how it could decide to delay elections of any assembly beyond the period of 90 days from the date of dissolution of the said assembly as mandated by the Constitution.
The petition argued that the ECP was bound to obey and implement the judgments of the Supreme Court and had no power or jurisdiction to overrule or review them.
The ECP could not act in defiance of the Supreme Court’s directions as it had done in this case which was illegal and liable to be set aside, the petition pleaded.

By announcing Oct 8 as the date, the ECP had delayed the elections for more than 183 days beyond the 90-day limit as prescribed in the Constitution.
The petition said that if the excuse of unavailability of security personnel was accepted this time, it would set a precedent to delay any future elections.
The petition added that there was no assurance that these factors — financial constraints, security situation, and non-availability of security personnel — would improve by Oct 8.
The “so-called excuse” would mean the Constitution could be held in abeyance every time elections were due, the petitioners feared, adding that in the past, similar situations had persisted, but elections were held in spite of them.
These situations could not be used as excuses to “subvert” the Constitution and deny people their right to elect representatives.
“Not holding elections in case of threats by terrorists will amount to giving in to the threats, which is in fact the aim of all terrorist activities,” the petition explained.

1,"Who is Humza Yousaf, the first Pakistani-origin leader of Scotland?","Yousaf’s tasks include formulation, development, presentation of Scottish govt policy","Pakistani origin Humza Yousaf on Monday was named the next leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP) following a controversial five-week leadership race.
Scotland’s health secretary will almost certainly become the country’s first minister on Tuesday following a vote in Holyrood.
Yousaf narrowly won the leadership race over finance secretary Kate Forbes, and former community safety minister Ash Regan and will replace Nicola Sturgeon, who announced her resignation in February 2023.
The first minister of Scotland is the leader of the Scottish government and the most senior elected politician in the devolved administration of Scotland.
The position is similar to that of a prime minister at the national level.
The first minister is appointed by the monarch after being nominated by the Scottish Parliament, typically from the majority or leading party.
The recent ascent of Yousaf within the SNP marks a significant milestone in the political landscape of the United Kingdom.
As a successor to Nicola Sturgeon, Yousaf's rise to prominence has captured national attention.
Born in Glasgow in 1985, Yousaf is the son of Pakistani immigrants who settled in Scotland in the 1960s.
Yousaf was raised with a strong sense of community and an appreciation for multiculturalism.
He attended the University of Glasgow, where he studied politics and graduated with honours.
Yousaf's political career began in 2011 when he was elected as a member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Glasgow at the age of 25, making him the youngest MSP at the time.
Over the past decade, Yousaf held several prominent positions within the SNP, including Minister for External Affairs and International Development, Minister for Transport and the Islands, and most recently, Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care.
Throughout his political career, Yousaf had been a strong advocate for social justice, equality, and human rights.
Yousaf championed numerous progressive policies and initiatives, such as increasing funding for mental health services, promoting renewable energy and public transportation, and supporting refugees and asylum seekers. In 2012, he played a critical role in the successful passage of the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Act, which legalised same-sex marriage in Scotland.
As a British Pakistani, Yousaf's rise in the SNP was not only a testament to his political acumen but also an example of the UK's growing diversity and inclusivity.
Yousaf had been open about the challenges he faced as a person of colour in politics, and his success serves as an inspiration to other minority communities in the UK.
Yousaf's parents emigrated from Pakistan to Scotland in the 1960s, seeking better opportunities and a brighter future. His father hailed from the city of Faisalabad, while his mother came from the bustling metropolis of Karachi.
Yousaf's family ties to Pakistan remained strong, as he often visited his extended family in the country and maintained a close connection with his heritage.
Yousaf consistently advocated for strong ties between Scotland and Pakistan, both economically and culturally. As a minister for external affairs and international development, he played a crucial role in fostering trade relations between the two countries.
Under his leadership, Scotland and Pakistan signed a memorandum of understanding to boost collaboration in the fields of education, health, and renewable energy.
Yousaf had also been an advocate for the rights of the Pakistani diaspora in the UK. He worked tirelessly to promote social cohesion and inclusivity, fighting against discrimination and prejudice faced by minority communities.
Yousaf's grandfather, Abdul Ghani, was a prominent freedom fighter during the Pakistan Movement, which ultimately led to the creation of Pakistan as an independent nation in 1947. Yousaf's political inclinations could be traced back to his grandfather's commitment to social justice and equality. Yousaf fluent in Urdu, the national language of Pakistan, regularly used the language to engage with the Pakistani community in Scotland, fostering a sense of unity and belonging.
Yousaf wife Nadia El-Nakla is of Scottish, Moroccan, and Palestinian descent, who works as an events and engagement manager for a charity. The couple got married in 2018, and have a daughter named Amal, who was born in 2019.
The family enjoyed a relatively private life, and Yousaf and his wife occasionally shared glimpses of their life together on social media.
In 2016, Yousaf received the prestigious Sitara-i-Quaid-i-Azam award from the president of Pakistan, in recognition of his efforts to strengthen relations between Scotland and Pakistan.
This award was one of the highest civilian honours in Pakistan, reflecting the significant impact Yousaf had on bilateral ties.
Yousaf was an avid cricket fan and a keen supporter of the Pakistani cricket team. He often shared his enthusiasm for the sport on social media and attended cricket matches between Pakistan and other countries, showcasing his love for the game and his ancestral homeland.
Yousaf’s succession of Nicola Sturgeon as the leader of the SNP could signal a new era of inclusivity and diversity within the party and the broader UK political landscape.
Yousaf's potential leadership could also lead to stronger ties with ethnic minority communities and further promote social justice and equality.
Yousaf's potential leadership could also impact the UK's foreign policy, especially regarding relations with Pakistan and other South Asian countries. As a British Pakistani, Yousaf might bring a unique perspective and understanding of the region, which could result in a more collaborative and nuanced approach to foreign relations.

2,K-P all set to have first woman chief justice,Two PHC senior judges are scheduled to retire this week,"The Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province is expected to have its first woman chief justice as two senior judges of the Peshawar High Court (PHC) are scheduled to retire this week.
PHC Chief Justice Qaiser Rashid, who is also a member of the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC), is retiring on March 30 and Senior Puisne Judge Roohul Amin Khan on March 31.
After their retirement, Justice Musarrat Hilali is the senior-most in the PHC judges’ seniority list. Therefore, she will be the first woman PHC chief justice until her retirement on August 7.
Interestingly, Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial has yet to summon a meeting of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) to consider the nomination of the new PHC CJ. It is expected that Justice Musarrat will be appointed as an acting CJ first. Later, she may be recommended as a permanent PHC CJ.
Former K-P advocate general Shumail Butt said, “Iit is a proud moment for the K-P province.”
A province otherwise portrayed as a hardliner archaic hub of patriarchal mindset was going to appoint the first lady chief justice of the high court.
“This is going to present a very soft image of Pashtuns to the world,"" Sarwar Muzaffar Shah Advocate, who is doing practice at the PHC, said.
“Justice Musarrat’s appointment as the first woman chief justice of K-P is a positive development in many aspects- she is a judge who demonstrates a lot of judicial courage on the bench which even some men judges lack it.""
Though she will be the chief justice of the PHC for a few months, symbolically it will have far-reaching effects especially for the women of the province.
Advocate Sarwar stated that many young girls, especially law students and lawyers, would be encouraged because a very high glass ceiling would be shattered by her appointment as the K-P chief justice.
""Her most celebrated characteristic as a judge is that she is an independent-minded judge who takes decisions without fear or favour,"" he added.
Another lawyer Umer Gilani said that as the first-ever woman chief justice of a high court, the elevation of Justice Musarrat would be a milestone in judicial history.
""In almost one decade of judicial service, Justice Musarrat has established herself as a judge of unimpeachable integrity. She carries out her court in a commanding yet courteous manner. Pakistan can rightfully be proud of the accomplishment of such a person,” he added.
Meanwhile, K-P lawyers were upset for not considering PHC judges’ elevation to the Supreme Court.
Pakistan Bar Council member Amjad Shah expressed disappointment for ignoring two senior-most PHC judges regarding their elevation to the SC and now they were retiring this week.
He wondered why the PHC judges were being subjected to discrimination. He said that after the merger of Federally Administered Tribal Areas, the population of the K-P province had increased. “At least the two PHC judges should be elevated to the SC,” he added.
Interestingly, CJP Bandial had recommended the elevation of incumbent PHC CJ Qaiser Rashid last year but majority of the JCP members were in favour to defer his nomination. Later, he was not recommended for elevation to the SC.
Strong voices were being raised from the bench and the bar over what was being seen as an “improper” representation in the superior court.
Last year, a delegation of four PHC judges met with CJP Bandial to convey their concerns over the non-nomination of a judge of the PHC for elevation to the apex court.

3,PTI raises spectre of ‘FATF grey listing’ over govt crackdown,Fawad warns human rights violations pushing country towards global sanctions," 
Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Senior Vice President Fawad Chaudhry said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has given an irrational response to President Dr Arif Alvi’s letter which drew his attention towards the constitutional provisions.
On Friday, Alvi wrote a letter to Shehbaz, asking him to direct the authorities concerned to assist the Election Commission of Pakistan with the holding of elections in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.
In the letter, the president mentioned the holding of elections in the two provinces as per the timeframe, in compliance with the Supreme Court’s order dated March 1, 2023 was essential to avoid further complications, including contempt of court.
Alvi’s letter came in response to the ECP’s decision of postponing the Punjab Assembly elections till Oct 8. The ECP had cited security threats and lack of funds behind delaying the elections.
Addressing a news conference along with PTI Secretary General Asad Umar, Azam Swati and others at the Lahore Press Club on Sunday, Fawad stressed that there was no other way to bring political stability in the country except by implementing the provisions laid out in the Constitution. He said, “The prime minister did not respond logically even to a single question raised by the president in his letter. It seems that some Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) spokesperson wrote the prime minister’s response.”
He said, “What is happening in Pakistan today was not possible even in the worst monarchies. It seems that the ‘Nazi’ government has been imposed in Pakistan. We have left behind atrocities faced by the people of Burma and North Korea.”
He underscored that all eyes were now on the Supreme Court (SC), adding that owing to gross violations of human rights and restrictions on freedom of expression, there was qualmishness in the international community about the state of human rights in Pakistan.
He claimed that over 2,000 leaders and workers of his party had been arrested ahead of the PTI’s Minar-i-Pakistan public rally on Saturday.
“People are being picked and rendered missing from Lahore. Azhar Mashwani went missing. It has been three days,” he highlighted.
He said the caretaker Punjab government had blocked all roads leading to Minar-i-Pakistan on the pre-text of security. All entry and exit points of the city were closed down by placing containers on roads, however, a large number of people showed up at the rally by crossing all obstacles and announced their verdict against these “imported rulers”.
Fawad warned that all these human rights violations were pushing the country towards international sanctions.
The Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government’s actions against the people of Pakistan would place Pakistan back on the grey list of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).
He asserted that there was no room for enforced disappearances in Pakistan otherwise the country could face devastating economic consequence in the shape of sanctions.
He accused for Federal Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah of operating a “gang”, questioning him about his politics.
He said the government was doing politics based on fear. “We are asking you to do your own politics and let us do ours too.”
Addressing the news conference, Umar said the way Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had responded to the president’s letter was enough to show that how lowly a man he was.
Criticising the government, he pointed out that so far six persons had lost their lives in the pursuit of obtaining subsidised wheat flour.
“The incumbent government will drag down the country on the Financial Action Task Force’s grey list again,” he warned.
He warned that there would be no democracy in Pakistan if the country was run the way it was being run. The coming week would be decisive in the history of Pakistan as everyone was looking towards the top court.
“The country has no longer a judiciary of the 1950s and everyone will see the judiciary defending the Constitution and the country,” he maintained.

4,Afghanistan beat Pakistan to win T20I series,Rashid and co beat Shadab-led Men in Green by seven wickets in the second T20I," 
Afghanistan on Sunday defeated Pakistan by seven wickets to bag an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match T20I series at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium in the United Arab Emirates.
It was a historic moment for the Afghans as this was the first time ever that they’d downed the Men in Green in any series across any format.
In an attempt to chase a 131-run target, Afghanistan played slowly but maturely to reach the target with just one ball to go.
Death-bowling specialist Zaman Khan was unable to save five runs off the last over as Afghanistan crossed the line courtesy to Najibullah Zadran’s winning four on the second last ball of the match.
Opener Rahamanullah Gurbaz set the tone for Afghanistan’s chase with 44 off 49 balls, courtesy of only one six and two fours.
Ibrahim Zadran then contributed an important 38 runs off 40 balls at the one-down position with three fours to his name.
When asked to finish the match, veteran all-rounder Mohammad Nabi produced 14 off just 9 balls to take the Afghans to the finish line and make sure they broke the tape before Pakistan.
For Pakistan, only Zaman Khan and Ihsanullah were able to bag one wicket apiece.
Earlier, Pakistan batted first and all thanks to Imad Wasim’s 64 off 57 balls, were able to post a reasonable 131-run target on the board. Captain Shadab was the second-best batter with his 32 off 25 balls.
Pakistan started their innings by losing two wickets for zero after Fazalhaq Farooqi bowled a double-wicket maiden.
Maverick opener Saim Ayub was caught behind brilliantly by keeper Rahmanullah Gurbaz on the second ball of the Pakistani innings.
Incoming batter Abdullah Shafique was once again caught LBW, after losing his wicket in the same fashion in the first T20I.
Farooqi brought the ball swinging back into the right-handed batter, who was unable to predict the movement while trying to play across the line.
Right-handed opener Mohammad Haris tried to give Pakistan the much-needed push with a six and two fours. However, his innings of intent came to a premature end when he edged one to the keeper for an easy catch off pacer Naveenul Haq.
Tayyab Tahir, another youngster in the Pakistan squad, tried to protect his wicket to give the Men in Green a dependable option in the middle-order, but he also couldn’t lengthen his stay after scoring 13 off 23 balls.
Big-hitter Azam Khan was dismissed by Afghan captain Rashid after facing four deliveries for only one run.
Farooqi was the hero for Afghanistan with the ball bagging two wickets off four overs, giving one maiden and 19 runs.
Naveen, Rashid, and Karim Jannat bagged one wicket each for Afghanistan.
The last T20I of the three-match series will be played at Sharjah again, on Monday, March 27.
