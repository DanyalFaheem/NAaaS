0,Flour distribution sparks stampede,Dozens left injured in Mardan; women protest unfair distribution in Tank,"The distribution of free wheat flour remains far from orderly across Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) despite the assignment of each district to a secretary as on Sunday dozens of people were injured as a result of a stampede during the distribution in Mardan district.
Local residents told The Express Tribune that the distribution of flour started in the morning in Mardan Sports Complex but soon the slow pace of distribution resulted in a stampede when police used baton to keep people in proper order.
“Dozen have been injured during the stampede when the authorities and police failed to control the crowd,” said a local resident, adding that the stampede started when police fired shots in the air to control the mob which surrounded the flour trucks.
As a result local residents blocked the main Nowshera-Mardan Road to protest the police high-handedness. They also attacked the main gate of the sports complex with stones.
On the other hand in Tank district of K-P, dozens of women staged a protest against what they called clear-cut favouritism on the part of district administration in the flour distribution.
Five people have been killed in the province in similar incidents since the start of Ramazn across K-P.
One person was killed and eight others were injured during a stampede for free flour in Charsadda on the first day of the holy month of Ramazan.
The prices of basic food items have rocketed in recent months, with inflation at a near 50-year high as the country grapples with a balance of payments crisis that has seen it forced back into negotiations with the International Monetary Fund.
“Nine people were trampled and were taken to hospital where one person died,” said Muhammad Arif, police chief for Charsadda.
Arif said that hundreds of people gathered at the local market for the handouts, one of hundreds of distribution points set up by the government during Ramazan.
Millions of low-income families across the country are registered under the scheme.
In a nearby district, a man died and four others were injured when a wall they were sitting on collapsed as crowds amassed for free flour.
The provincial government has assigned monitoring tasks of free flour distribution to all administrative secretaries and directed them to ensure the availability of food items on the notified public rates.
On the directives of caretaker Chief Minister Azam Khan the administrative secretaries will monitor rates and availability of flour and other edibles in local markets generally, during the holy month of Ramazan in their respective districts, said a notification issued here on Saturday.
The secretary of food department will monitor Peshawar, secretary C&W Mardan, secretary excise and taxation Kohat and Karak, secretary irrigation Nowshera and Charsadda, secretary auqaf Khyber and Mohmand.

1,Mountaineering reemerges as sport in Bajaur district,"A group of college professors and friends have formed a mountaineering group, exploring different peaks every week","In the mountainous Bajaur tribal district of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), a group of college professors and friends have formed a mountaineering group, exploring different peaks every week.
Professor Khalid Habib is a resident of Bajaur who, along with other teachers of his college and friends, has formed a hiking group. Each week they go on a hiking trip to different mountainous areas of the district to relax their minds and enjoy nature in its pristine form in these isolated craggy mountains. His group is not the only one in the tribal district as the people of Bajaur naturally love their mountain ranges and going out to mountains is a centuries-old tradition and hobby.
“Bajaur is well known for its green fertile valleys and snow-capped mountains and a brief pause in terrorism in 2014 onwards provided the local youth with a golden opportunity to materialize their passion for mountaineering,” said Khalid Habib while talking to The Express Tribune. Kohimor, also known as Kymore Mountain locally, is located in the Baran tehsil of Bajaur and is the highest peak in the district.
“You can take your vehicle to the nearby village in the foot of the hills known as Seri Sar which is located around 12 km from the main bazar of Khar,” he said, adding that after reaching the village you have to follow the trail to the top on foot. Kohimor has three peaks, which can be seen from all parts of the districts, and when visibility is good, it can even be seen from Peshawar and Nowshera.
According to a local elder, Malik Gul Zada, some thirty years ago, the whole mountain was covered in trees, but as the population increased in the area and need for the timber went up, people started cutting trees which led to complete deforestation.
“When I was a child it was a lush green forest rich in all kinds of local fauna and flora. The soil is really fertile even today making it possible to plant trees once again,” he added.
Mountaineering parties from across the district regularly come here and if trees are planted its climate would also improve further, he maintained.
Another local Mosali Khan noted that due to deforestation the biodiversity of the region has been badly damaged and can only be restored through government intervention.

2,Sikhs arrange iftar for fasting Muslims,Sikh families take turns to arrange iftari for Muslims throughout the month,"The Sikh community in Peshawar continues its tradition of arranging iftari for the needy and poor.
Feeding the poor is considered an obligation in the Sikh religion and the community living in Peshawar often distributes free food but during the holy month of Ramazan special arrangements are made for iftari.
Different Sikh families living in the Mohalla Jogan Shah area of the walled city take turns to arrange it as a result these ‘distarkhwans’ work round the month.
Sikh traders are also known for announcing special discounts in their shops during Ramazan besides donating money to the needy. For ordinary folks, gathering of Sikhs around long plastic mats spread to serve food to fasting locals in places like Bolton Block of Lady Reading Hospital (LRH) is strange yet pleasant experience.
“This year within four days of Ramazan, we have distributed food items among 100 deserving (Muslim) families,” informs Jatinder Singh, Chairman Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chapter of National Peace Council for Interfaith Harmony. We are now arranging iftari for which Sikh youth have volunteered in addition to providing food packets, Jatinder told APP.
Each of the ration pack consists of essential items including cooking oil, rice, pulses, chick pea, beans, sugar and tea, he added.
