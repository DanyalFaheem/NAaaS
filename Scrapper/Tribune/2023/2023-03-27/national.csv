0,Personal data – a big threat,"As technology continues to advance, concerns around privacy and data security grow","In today’s world, personal information is the biggest asset for any person. It can be used to harm financially, physically and emotionally. The trade of protecting personal information is called data protection and privacy.
Data privacy is a rapidly evolving area of concern in today’s digital world. With the rise of the internet and the increasing amount of personal information that is shared online, protecting this information has become more important than ever.
Data privacy is a concern for individuals, businesses, and governments, as it affects the way personal information is collected, used, and shared. It is important to ensure that personal information is collected, used, and processed in a responsible, transparent and lawful manner, that individuals have control over their own personal data.
In the digital age, the definition of personal data and sensitive data has expanded to include things like name, date of birth, mother’s maiden name, national ID number, passport number, social security number, phone number, home address, office address, IP addresses, biometrics, bank account number, credit card number, PIN, medical/ health record, criminal record, religious and race information, location and other online identifiers, making it more difficult to determine what information is protected by these laws.
The data protection legislation was initially established as the Swedish Data Act of 1973, followed by the United States’ Privacy Act in 1974, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (OECD) published guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Trans border Flows in 1980, European Union’s (EU) Data Protection Directive in 1995 and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2016.
Other countries including Canada, Singapore and Australia around the world have also developed their own data protection laws.
With the proliferation of digital economy, the amount of personal information that is collected, stored and processed by organisations has exploded, making it more important than ever to ensure that this information is protected from unauthorised access or disclosure.
At the same time, the rise of the internet and social media has made it easier for individuals to share personal information online, increasing the potential for this information to be accessed or misused by others.
One of the key challenges in protecting data privacy is the fact that the laws and regulations governing this area are constantly evolving. In the past, many of these laws were focused on protecting personal information from being accessed or disclosed without permission.
Additionally, the rise of big data and the increasing use of artificial intelligence have made it possible to collect and analyse vast amounts of personal information, further complicating the issue of data privacy.
Another major challenge in protecting data privacy is the fact that many individuals are not aware of their rights and responsibilities when it comes to their personal data.
However, there are several steps that can be implemented to protect personal data:
One, creating awareness among employees, customers, and stakeholders about the importance of personal data protection and the risks associated with data breaches.
Two, implementing security measures to protect personal data from unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. This could include encryption, masking, access controls, firewalls, anti-virus software, and regular software updates.
Three, conducting risk assessment to identify vulnerabilities and threats to personal data and to evaluate the effectiveness of security measures in place.
Four, establishing policies and procedures for the collection, use, storage, and disposal of personal data. This should include guidelines for data retention, data sharing, and data disposal.
Five, providing training to employees and other stakeholders on data protection policies, procedures, and best practices.
Six, monitoring and auditing data protection policies and procedures to ensure that personal data is being handled in accordance with relevant laws and regulations.
Seven, responding to incident of data breaches or other incidents involving personal data.
Eight, regularly reviewing and updating policies and procedures in response to changing legal requirements, technological advances, or new risks and threats.
By implementing these steps, organisations can take a proactive approach to personal data protection and minimise the risk of data breaches and other security incidents.
Pakistan has taken steps towards data protection in recent years. In 2016, the country passed the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA), which criminalises a range of cybercrimes, including unauthorised access to data and hacking.
The act also established the National Response Centre for Cyber Crimes (NR3C) to investigate and prosecute cybercrimes.
In 2018, the government of Pakistan introduced the Personal Data Protection Bill, which seeks to regulate the collection, processing, and storage of personal data. The bill is currently under review and has not yet been passed into law.
In addition to these legislative efforts, the government has also established the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) to oversee and regulate the telecommunications industry, including issues related to data protection and privacy.
The PTA has issued guidelines and regulations on data retention, encryption, and other aspects of data protection.
However, there are still concerns about the effectiveness of these measures in practice. There are also concerns about the government’s ability to protect personal data from unauthorised access, particularly in the absence of a comprehensive data protection framework.
The future scope of personal data protection is expected to expand as technology continues to advance, and as concerns around privacy and data security grow.
Some possible directions for future developments in personal data protection may include: strengthening regulations, increasing transparency, greater accountability, advancements in technology and greater consumer awareness.
Overall, the future scope of personal data protection is likely to expand as technology and society continue to evolve.
As individuals and organisations become more aware of the importance of data privacy and security, we can expect to see more efforts to protect personal data and to ensure that it is used ethically and responsibly.

1,Stagflation: a complicated situation for policymakers,Unemployment increasing along with acceleration in goods prices,"Political temperature in Pakistan is on the rise owing to the lingering situation. The cat and mouse game keeps on increasing political turbulence. A temporary pause in dialogue between Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is also aggravating the economic situation. Political turbulence and the dialogue standoff are enhancing economic uncertainty.
The dwindling foreign exchange reserves, which are hovering around $4.6 billion, are also posing a significant challenge to the government, which has already imposed import curbs to maintain a minimal level of reserves.
Import curbs have slowed down the economy a great deal. A significant number of large-scale manufacturing plants are bound to shut down due to the shortage of raw material and intermediate inputs.
Pakistan’s economy is experiencing shortages owing to import dependence. The journey of import dependence increased when critics came down hard on the import substitution strategy and pushed for export-led growth.
Proponents of export-led growth could not anticipate the current situation. They have been maintaining this position since the 1990s when a policy shift was taken to orient the economy towards the so-called export-led growth.
Every now and then, these analysts find faults in import substitution and recommend tariff reforms.
Some analysts consider the export-led growth an easy way out of the current impasse. They are oblivious of the fact that business firms have to face tough competition where price and quality play a pivotal role. Price and quality competitiveness comes through learning by doing.
Learning by doing is achieved through an enormous amount of effort where business firms act in small steps. Then these steps are combined to achieve a mastery, which requires a lot of time.
Many firms normally fail to achieve this mastery. Hence, a few firms become successful in this vein.
Business firms have to plough back to expand and remain competitive in the globalised world. This requires industrial capitalists to focus on their core business and stay away from the speculative business activities.
However, the country’s industrial capitalists engage in real estate and other speculative activities. Even they invest their profits in buying stocks. These quick capital gains divert their attention from the core business.
That is the reason why a mushroom growth in housing schemes is being witnessed.
Housing schemes are still hitting the deck when the industrial growth is negative. The unplanned growth of housing schemes will have environmental and ecological consequences, which have started to create havoc for the metropolitan cities.
The cities are experiencing water, noise and air pollution. Green land is being converted into brown one in haste. There is a need to properly assess the cultivated area as food grains are not meeting the domestic needs.
In addition, there is a shortage of food grains, which is making them dearer day by day.
For instance, the support price of wheat was fixed at Rs2,200 per 40 kg in 2022, which has been jacked up to Rs4,000 per 40 kg in 2023 as the impact of devaluation of the rupee played a major role in it.
The expensive food grains increase the money wage of the working class. In a labour-intensive industry, high money wages make products expensive. As a result, expensive products lose their competitiveness in a tough competitive environment.
In short, the economy is experiencing stagflation where unemployment increases along with acceleration in prices. This is a complicated situation for the policymakers to address. Let us see how the government deals with this situation in the coming months.

2,Pakistan fails to earn dollars through carbon credits,"Credits can be earned via reforestation, green covers, solar and wind power","Carbon trading offers emerging and innovative trade and business opportunities to the developing countries, which can earn dollars for controlling the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
A carbon credit or a carbon offset is a credit for the GHG emissions reduced or removed from the atmosphere by an emission-reducing activity pursued by a government, industry, or private individuals to compensate for the emissions generated elsewhere.
This Cap and Trade Model was adopted at the Glasgow COP26 climate change summit in November 2021, which agreed to create a global carbon credit offset trading market. Therefore, any intervention that can verify control, reduction, avoidance and destruction of one metric ton of GHG would mean the earning of one carbon credit.
Major emission-control tools and techniques eligible for carbon credit are avoidance of natural loss due to deforestation/ degradation, nature-based sequestration like reforestation, reduction of emissions (methane) from animal dung/landfills and removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and or its destruction using various techniques.
Carbon credits can be earned either in the compliance markets which are created and regulated by national, regional, or international carbon-reduction regimes, or in the voluntary markets which function outside of the compliance markets and enable companies and individuals to purchase carbon offsets.
In the voluntary carbon market, carbon credits are purchased, usually by organisations, for voluntary use. Voluntary carbon markets are growing, driven in part by demand from businesses looking to offset their emissions.
Carbon markets are regulated through international, regional and subnational carbon-reduction schemes, such as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the Kyoto Protocol, the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU-ETS) and the California Carbon Market.
Pakistan’s collaboration with China’s carbon emission trading scheme from 2021 to 2025 also offers great opportunities. Under the International Emissions Trading (IET), countries can trade in the international carbon credit market to cover their shortfall in the assigned amount of units.
Countries with surplus units can sell them to countries that are exceeding their emissions targets under Annex B of the Kyoto Protocol. Farmers and any landowners can sell carbon credits because land can store carbon. To enroll, you need to have land maps available that document your ownership of the land, as well as the legal description of the land.
Landowners can sell carbon offsets on the voluntary carbon markets. These carbon credit buyers are purchasing carbon credits as an investment or are businesses trying to meet internal standards for carbon footprint reduction.
Anyone owning and managing forestland may be able to sell carbon credits generated from management activities on your land. However, there are several questions to consider before pursuing detailed eligibility requirements.
Countries with surplus units can sell them to countries that are exceeding their emission targets under Annex B of the Kyoto Protocol. The concept of Carbon Credit Trading is set out in Article 17 of the Kyoto Protocol.
Currently, India and China are the biggest sellers of carbon credit whereas countries in Europe are the biggest buyers. If a project can quantifiably and repeatedly produce less GHG than the current alternative, it will be eligible to earn carbon credits.
For example, replacing a coal plant with a planned life of 30 years with a solar farm after five years would avoid 25 years of coal emissions. Personal carbon credits are a voluntary method for individuals to directly reduce energy consumption and the resulting GHG emissions.
Successful individual reductions are rewarded through lower utility costs and the value of the created personal carbon credits.
Pakistan can also earn carbon credits through plantation, reforestation, various green covers, solar and wind power, controlling methane emissions from livestock and paddy fields and such other activities that control GHG emissions.
Pakistan has successfully completed a carbon credit earning project and the government of Sindh has already earned carbon credits for the mangrove forests and they got the first tranche of $14.75 million in 2022, which may rise to $24-25 million in the next five years and this increase will continue for the 60-year pledge period.
Therefore, Pakistan is already enjoying the benefits of carbon credits from a forestry project and thus there is a great deal of scope and opportunities for earning carbon credits on a larger scale.
This great success story of earning carbon credits can now easily be replicated to other forestry and GHG-controlling projects but the lack of capacity, institutional arrangements and commitments are obstructing the process.
Pakistan not only lacks adequate capacity but also clarity and commitments amid the issue of ownership of carbon stock mostly owned by provinces after the 18th Amendment-led devolution.
The Ministry of Climate Change is the focal point for the UNFCCC and other such international instruments including the methane pledge and carbon trading progression but the lack of clear policy and mandate is jeopardising Pakistan’s ability to earn dollars from selling its carbon credits.
The ministry is stuck with establishing a registry, stopping the simultaneous parallel work on pursuing solar, hydel and methane-pledge projects, which can earn dollars.
As the ministry lacks the technical expertise in this highly innovative area, the decisions made by generalists, also called taboos, are compromising the ability to earn carbon credits on a fast track.
We missed earning dollars from CDM that operated from 2005 till recently (existed only for a couple of years in project mode), with the proposal submission ratio of only 0.6% and earning only 0.4% of the dollars compared to the Asia-Pacific (India and China). If the business continues as usual, we are missing a much greater opportunity again.
Pakistan can easily earn dollars as has already been done by the government of Sindh, which earned dollars from mangrove carbon credits. The irony in not limited to the capacity but the lack of clarity on voluntary markets.
There is complete silence from the corridors of focal ministry to guide, educate and create awareness about this booming business. Pakistan is embarking on solarisation to plug power shortage but solar energy also earns carbon credits at the individual and corporate scales that the ministry is silent about.
In addition, all the hydro, biogas, plantation and other such green businesses can bring dollars on a very fast track, provided the focal ministry is proactive and willing to facilitate and support such strategic initiatives.

3,US-Pakistan Green Alliance framework,"It is a pivotal partnership for sustainable development, improving lives of people","As the world grapples with the urgent need to address climate change, the United States and Pakistan are leading the charge with a ground-breaking collaboration: the US-Pakistan Green Alliance.
A dynamic partnership aimed at boosting bilateral cooperation on sustainable development, clean energy, and climate action, this is poised to not only enhance climate action efforts but also stimulate economic growth, improve the quality of life, and provide a model for other countries to follow.
During a meeting with senior journalists, US Ambassador Donald Bloom referred to the alliance as “a prime example of a strong and enduring partnership aimed at improving the lives of Pakistanis and Americans.”
Pakistan is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including water scarcity, extreme weather events, and declining crop yields. The country also faces significant challenges in meeting its growing energy demand, which have led to increased reliance on fossil fuels and worsened environmental degradation.
The alliance seeks to address these challenges by promoting renewable energy (RE), sustainable agriculture, and green transportation, among other areas. Additionally, it aims to create new opportunities for economic growth and development in Pakistan. By investing in sustainable infrastructure, innovation, and research and development, the alliance seeks to revolutionise Pakistan’s economy while promoting environmental sustainability.
The key objectives of the alliance include: One – Strengthening renewable energy capacity and efficiency: The US has a long history of supporting Pakistan in the energy sector. As part of the alliance, the US is helping Pakistan increase its RE capacity by investing in RE projects.
This includes supporting updates to the Mangla and Tarbela Dam power stations. Once finished, Mangla Dam’s capacity will increase by 30% and Tarbela Dam’s life will increase by 30 years.
Additionally, the US is supporting the solarisation initiative, under which 10,000MW of solar power will be installed, providing power to more than a third of Pakistani households.
These efforts will bolster Pakistan’s goal of generating 60% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030 from the current 34%.
The US will also provide technical assistance to improve Pakistan’s energy efficiency, particularly in the industrial and transport sectors, leading to reduced energy consumption, decreased greenhouse gas emissions, and mitigating the impacts of climate change.
This support includes a grant to further R&D of electric vehicles at LUMS and a $500,000 project to restore electricity infrastructure in the flood-hit areas in Sindh.
Two – Promoting sustainable agriculture and water management practices: The US famously supported Pakistan’s “Green Revolution” in the 1960s when US agronomist and Nobel laureate Dr Norman E Borlaug worked with Pakistani scientists to increase the productivity of wheat varieties by 25%.
Similarly, this alliance aims to promote sustainable agricultural practices to improve productivity and reduce the environmental footprint of agricultural sector.
Pakistan Agricultural Technology Transfer Activity has introduced innovative tools and technologies for nearly 150,000 farmers, while the Horticultural Advancement Activity in K-P and Balochistan has helped over 12,000 farmers to improve management practices and technologies on 2,000 hectares, increasing yield and reducing harvest and post-harvest losses.
Additionally, the US support has improved irrigation of 5,500 hectares in Gilgit-Baltistan, providing more than 4,000 jobs and helping 5,707 farmers increase production.
Under the alliance, the US will launch additional initiatives to support the sector, including a four-year $4.5 million fertiliser efficiency “Fertiliser Right” programme, a climate-smart agricultural programme to build the resilience of farming communities facing climate change and involving studies and capacity building to improve waste management practices, and methane abatement through changes in animal feed, reproductive health, and manure management.
On water management, the US government has helped provide more than 95% of Pakistan’s water storage capacity through the Mangla, Tarbela, and Gomal Zam dams. These dams help prevent potential flood damage for millions of Pakistanis.
Three – Enhancing climate resilience and adaptation measures: The US will support Pakistan in building climate-resilient infrastructure, such as real-time flood forecasting, protection of natural areas, environmentally conscious designs, and stormwater management systems.
It has given $1 billion to the GCF, part of which will go towards climate adaptation initiatives, such as climate-resilient agriculture and Indus Basin water management.
Moreover, the US Cotton Council advises Pakistani partners on cotton use, enhancing the effectiveness of $4.4 billion worth of textile exports to the US annually.
The US will launch an accelerator programme to mobilise domestic and international finance for clean energy and catalyse investment for climate mitigation and adaptation.
Additionally, a feasibility study grant will be funded to improve Karachi’s environmental conditions and waste management practices through advanced technology to convert cattle waste into biomethane and fertiliser.
Four – Supporting capacity building, education, and innovation in the green sector: The alliance strongly emphasises capacity building and innovation in the green sector. This includes establishing vocational training programmes for green jobs, fostering environmental awareness through educational initiatives, and supporting research and development in clean technologies.
The US-Pakistan Green Alliance promises to have the following impacts:
One, the alliance can drive economic growth by creating new opportunities in the RE, agriculture, and clean technology sectors, leading to new industries, job creation, and economic diversification.
Two, the alliance will enhance Pakistan’s energy security and reduce dependence on fossil fuels by increasing the share of RE in the energy mix. This will ensure stable energy supply and decrease Pakistan’s vulnerability to global price fluctuations.
Three, by promoting energy efficiency and sustainable practices, the alliance will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote sustainability, and support Pakistan in building resilience against climate change impacts.
Four, the alliance will reduce pollution by promoting sustainable practices, improving air quality, reducing water contamination, and creating healthier ecosystems. These improvements will benefit public health and reduce the prevalence of water and airborne diseases and other pollution-related health issues. Five, the alliance strengthens the strategic partnership between the US and Pakistan by fostering cooperation on climate change and environmental issues.
By working together to achieve common sustainability goals, the two countries can enhance mutual trust, promote regional stability, and create a platform for further cooperation in other areas of mutual interest. Amidst ongoing debates over the disproportionate impacts of climate change between the global south and north, the US-Pakistan Green Alliance is a significant step towards addressing this critical challenge and fostering sustainable development between nations.
By working together to enhance climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts, foster green economic growth, and promote research and innovation, the alliance has the potential to become a model of international cooperation in the fight against climate change, reaffirming the idea of ""one world, one goal"" in addressing the most pressing environmental challenges of our time.

4,Petro problems pile up,Govt’s inaction stalls solutions as it fears loss of political capital,"The government often chooses to defer the resolution of pressing issues, hoping that over time the problem will be resolved spontaneously or through unforeseen circumstances.
They shy away from taking bold decisions, fearing the loss of political capital and public disapproval. However, history has demonstrated that this approach is counterproductive, leading to the worsening of issues at hand and ultimately causing significant harm to the electorate.
For the last six months, representatives from the petroleum industry, analysts and experts have been warning of a looming crisis in the sector. The oil industry had already been facing difficulties due to the Letters of Credit (LC) opening and other issues.
Unfortunately, despite these warnings, no significant action was taken, and the situation has continued to deteriorate.
One of the key issues contributing to the crisis is the significant devaluation of Pakistani rupee. The exchange rate has plummeted in recent times, with the rupee falling from Rs260 against the US dollar at the end of February to almost Rs279 at present. The unofficial rate is believed to be even higher.
This stands in stark contrast to the same time last year when the rupee was trading at Rs179 against the US dollar. The currency’s sharp decline has resulted in substantial losses for the petroleum industry, encompassing both oil marketing companies (OMCs) and refineries. There exists a mechanism for the oil industry to recover losses by making adjustments in the in-land freight equalisation margin (IFEM), which is part of the final pump prices. However, reports suggest that the government is not implementing it fully. Rather, the authorities are adopting a phased approach, and even then, not all of the cost is being passed on to the consumer. The rationale behind this approach appears to be to avoid any further increase in fuel prices at petrol pumps. Despite the current challenges facing the petroleum industry, policymakers appear to be disengaged from finding a solution to the issue.
As Pakistani rupee continues to weaken, and with no viable solution in sight, the exchange losses incurred by the oil industry may grow. This would only exacerbate the already significant financial pressures facing the sector.
Apart from the issue of exchange rate, the petroleum industry is facing obstacles related to the procurement of petroleum products and crude oil due to the difficulties in opening LCs and obtaining their confirmation from foreign banks, as indicated earlier.
This challenge might intensify following Pakistan’s recent ratings downgrade.
On top of this, the petroleum sector is also grappling with declining sales, caused by both expensive prices at petrol pumps and a slow-down in economic activity.
A 19% drop in sales of petroleum products has been observed by the OMCs in the first eight months of current financial year, as compared to the same period of last year, as per data of the Oil Companies Advisory Council (OCAC).
Furthermore, the State Bank of Pakistan’s recent increase in interest rates is expected to have a negative impact on the industry’s bottom line as this is going to increase their finance costs.
The petroleum industry is facing an assortment of difficulties that have created a perfect storm. As a result, it is not surprising that some companies are reportedly abstaining from importing fuel to avert substantial exchange losses and LC-related complications. If this trend continues, it may potentially result in a fuel crisis.
It appears that the government is either unaware or indifferent to the potential repercussions of the petroleum industry’s collapse for the broader economy and the general population. If the industry experiences a downturn and the supply chain of refined petroleum products such as petrol and diesel is disrupted, the impact will reverberate across multiple sectors due to the central role fuel plays in the functioning of economy.
The smooth operation of nearly all industries, from transportation and logistics to FMCGs, relies on the uninterrupted supply of fuel.
This time around, the agriculture sector may be significantly affected if a fuel shortage happens in the coming weeks, as diesel demand typically increases during the wheat harvesting season that is quickly approaching.
A fuel shortage during a period of heightened demand can lead to hoarding and black marketing, causing an increase in the cost of doing business. Businesses may pass on these costs to consumers by raising prices, thereby contributing to inflation. Inevitably, it is the consumers who will bear the brunt of this situation.
If the government is truly dedicated to shielding consumers from the adverse effects of inflation, it must identify more effective solutions, rather than resorting to measures that may ultimately harm the economy and inflict hardship upon the population.
One potential approach could involve the creation of a transparent system that would allow for adjustments in future prices, safeguarding the industry from substantial foreign exchange losses.
It is imperative that the authorities take decisive action to address the issues plaguing the petroleum industry, such as LC complications, a mechanism for recovering foreign exchange losses, and other long-standing obstacles that have hindered the industry’s progress.
These include enhancing banking facilities to make up for the rupee’s devaluation and higher commodity prices in international markets, finding solution to the furnace oil issue, and introducing business-friendly policies to encourage investment.
