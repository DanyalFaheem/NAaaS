1,K-P to establish flour supply points at UC level,So far 22% of the targeted population has been provided with free flour in the province,"Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) caretaker Information Minister Barrister Feroz Jamal Shah Kaka Khel has said that free flour distribution points are being established in union councils so as to overcome the problem of overcrowding.
Addressing a press conference in Peshawar, Kaka Khel said that 1.27 million registered families have been provided with free flour so far and extending the distribution points to UCs would solve the problem of mismanagement and violent stampedes. 
“The provincial government is determined to serve and facilitate the general public as much as possible,” he said, adding that providing the deserving families with free flour was going on non-stop.
“So far 22 per cent of the targeted population has been provided with free flour in the province and to avoid the mismanagement the number of distribution points has been increased,” he maintained, adding that now each UC will have its own distribution point.
There is much space for improvement in the atta distribution system and steps have been taken to overcome the mismanagement issues. As a result for the past two days there was much improvement compared to the past, he noted.
“So far 7.78 million bags of free atta have been distributed. There were reports that the food deparment’s application about online complaints was down which is being fixed,” he shared, adding that a committee has been formed of administrative secretaries to monitor the atta distribution and improve the entire process.
“Each administrative secretary has been given two districts where they are responsible for the monitoring of the supply process,” explained the minister.
Furthermore, district administration has been directed to ensure its presence at the supply points.

2,Non-release of funds irks Balochistan,CM Bizenjo says every trick will be employed to get provincial share,"Balochistan government has expressed serious concern over the prolonged and unnecessary delay in the release of funds by the federal government under the Federal Public Sector Development Program (FPSDP) to the province.
In this regard, Chief Minister Balochistan, Mir Abdul Quddus Bizenjo chaired a high-level meeting, which reviewed the pace of development projects under the provincial and federal PSDPs. 
Additional Chief Secretary (Development), Hafiz Abdul Basit, Finance Secretary Qambar Dashti, Chief Minister’s Principal Secretary Imran Gichki, and other relevant officials also attended the meeting. 
The meeting was informed that the estimated cost of federal projects in the province this fiscal year is Rs103 billion. For these projects, Rs26 billion should be released every quarter and the federal government should have released Rs76 billion so far, but the province only received Rs31 billion as a result the pace of work on the development projects was painfully slow. 
In the meeting, it was decided to lodge a protest on the part of the Balochistan government against the negligence and step-motherly treatment with the federal government.
The chief minister said that the ministers of planning and development and finance held meetings with the federal ministers Ahsan Iqbal and Ishaq Dar in Islamabad where they were repeatedly assured that the federal government was working on the matter and the funds would soon be released but nothing practical came out of these assurances.
The chief minister said that every constitutional and legal procedure will be adopted to protect the constitutional rights of the province.
While giving a briefing on the progress of the development projects of the current financial year on behalf of ACS planning and development, the meeting was informed that according to the budget calendar, the preparations for the development program of the next financial year have been initiated. 
Finance secretary briefed the meeting on the financial situation and release of development funds in the province and on this occasion the chief minister directed speeding up the release of funds to ensure the timely completion of projects. He noted that the decisions made at the meeting should be implemented without delay.
Background
In January, Balochistan National Party (Awami) secretary general and provincial Minister for Agriculture Mir Asadullah Baloch said the federal government has not paid Rs40 billion for the current financial year to the province and Rs11 billion were outstanding for the last financial year.
He said that the flood-affected people were in desperate need of support but the province was always left alone in such natural disasters.
Talking to APP, he said the official matters were badly paralyzed because of the prevailing financial crisis in the province.
“Balochistan wants to get a suitable share of assistance for the rehabilitation of flood affectees pledged by global partners at the donors conference held in Geneva,” he added.
According to the constitution, Balochistan’s share in the national finance commission (NFC) award was protected, but the province received Rs11 billion less during the last financial year, while the payment for this quarter of the current financial year, which is close to Rs40 billion, was not provided.
