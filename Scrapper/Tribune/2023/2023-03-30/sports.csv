0,‘Teen shot by cops might never walk’,"Two policemen arrested, Rizvia police station SHO suspended","The family of an eighth-grader who was shot by police in the early hours of Wednesday said that he might not walk again while calling for strict action against the policemen involved in the shooting. 
Ayaan Imran, 16, was allegedly shot when he was returning home with a friend, each on separate motorcycle, at around sehri time. 
The friend told the family that they saw a police mobile van parked on the other side of the road near the Golimar underpass in the Rizvia area, while men in plainclothes pulled them over. One of them grabbed his hand due to which he along with his bike fell on the road. 
Ayaan was driving in the centre of the road, the friend told the family. By the time he stopped to check on him, the police had already shot him in the back. 
The family, quoting the friend, said that the men in plainclothes filmed the teen as he lay bleeding on the road. 
Ayyan was rushed to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, where doctors referred him to the Liaquat National Hospital due to his precarious condition. He was under critical care with the bullet still lodged in his body.
The family of the injured teen, relatives and area residents protested on Stadium Road, calling for action against the station house officer (SHO) of Rizvia police station and the police party responsible for the shooting. They demanded that a case be registered against them. 
They accused the police of targeting ordinary citizens and allowing street criminals and dacoits to roam free. 
Noman Saif, the boy's uncle told The Express Tribune that the victim's family had limited means. ""The father is a labourer and the boy is the eldest of three siblings. They can't afford treatment,"" he said. ""My nephew might never walk again.""
SSP Central Maroof Usman visited the hospital and spoke to the family. He told them that the Rizvia SHO had been suspended and the police constable responsible for the shooting, identified as Safdar, had been taken into custody. An investigation committee, headed by SSP West Investigation, had been formed and it includes the SP of Liaquatabad and the Nazimabad DSP, he said.
He told the parents that the SSP Central Office would bear the expenses of the boy's treatment. He assured them of complete support of the police force including in pursuing charges against police officials involved in the incident.

1,Hassan Niazi acquitted,The judicial magistrate ordered the police to release of him under Section 63,"A district and sessions court on Wednesday disposed of the cases of sedition, incitement and hate speech against PTI leader Hassan Niazi and ordered his release.
The Judicial Magistrate East reprimanded the police for producing Niazi in handcuffs and ordered the cops to remove the handcuffs.
The court inquired the police about the remand paper, to which the court was informed that it was with the investigation officer.
Police have sought two-week remand of Niazi, but the plea was opposed by defence lawyers, who argued that a false case has been registered against his client on political opposition. The investigation officer said that the accused has to be interrogated as there are very serious charges against him.
However, the court dismissed the case against Niazi and ordered his acquittal. The judicial magistrate ordered the police to release of him under Section 63.
Speaking to the media after the hearing, Sindh Assembly Opposition Leader Haleem Adil Sheikh said government was framing Imran Khan's supporters in false cases.
PTI activists were facing illegal arrests and detention, but today justice has prevailed. Sheikh urged the nation to come out for enforcement of the rule of the law.

3,Abbasi Shaheed Hospital doctors demand security,"On March 19, a group of drunken miscreants entered the hospital and harrassed women doctors","Doctors associated with the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital on Wednesday staged a protest outside the head office of Karachi Municipal Corporation (KMC) against poor security arrangements at their health facility.
On March 19, a group of drunken miscreants entered the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital at around 3 and hurled threats at women doctors and harassed them by filming them on their mobile phones without their permission.
The incident revealed that there are no closed circuit television cameras in the wards of the largest hospital managed by the KMC. In the Pediatric ICU, doctors have installed CCTV cameras on a self-help basis. Absence of CCTV cameras in the hospital has raised security concerns among the staff as miscreants misbehave with women doctors with impunity.
It is not the first time the doctors are protesting. They had earlier staged a protest and blocked the door of the KMC building. 
The protesting doctors who carried placards in favour of their demands moved to MA Jinnah Road which disrupted the flow of traffic and triggered a logjam. Several ambulances were also stuck in the snarl. After seeing people in distress, the doctors called off their protest.
They marched back to the KMC building's gate where officials held out an assurance that their demands would be met.
The doctors have been boycotting the OPDs at Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for the last 10 days. ""It is not just security there are many other problems at the hospital. There are no medicines, while water and gas supply is also erratic,"" said a protesting doctor. ""Patient only gets a doctor and a bed. All the remaining expenses have to be borne by their families.""
They said that the boycott of OPDs would continue till foolproof security was guaranteed at the hospital.

4,Foreign vets expected to visit Karachi zoo next week,Director says some improvement in elephant Noor Jehan's health,"The health of Noor Jahan, the sick African elephants, has not improved yet despite efforts taken by the administration of the Karachi zoo.
The administration said on Wednesday that the health of the elephant was improving after the medicine recommended by the foreign vets who carried out a tusk surgery on the animal in August last year.
""Yes, she is sick,"" confirmed Karachi Municipal Corporation (KMC) Senior Director Khalid Hashmi. But her health is improving slowly, he added.
The 17-year-old African-origin elephant appeared to be in pain as she stood and rubbed her head against the tree planted in the middle of the enclosure.
Visitors to the zoo expressed alarm at her gait. ""It seems all her weight is on her two legs,"" Shumaila Mehmood, a visitor, commented while making a video of the animal.
Foreign vets
The zoo administration says it has been in contact with a team of Four Paws, a Vienna-based animal welfare organization. The veterinarians associated with Four Paws will arrive in Karachi next week, they said.
Another team from Lahore is expected to visit the zoo as well. ""We are in contacts with all the best doctors in Pakistan and abroad,"" Hashmi said. He said that the medicine was being given to the elephants in line with prescriptions provided by foreign vets.
Interestingly, the syringes used in the elephant's treatment had to be acquired from Austria, sources at the zoo told The Express Tribune.
Relocation issue
The team of foreign vets had recommended last year that both African elephants - Noor Jehan and Madhubala - should immediately be relocated as the enclosure was not fit for their health.
It was also learnt that at least four letters have been written to the administration of Safari Park, some 18 km from Karachi Zoo, to set up an area for the elephants.
""Nothing has been done so far,"" a senior official disclosed. ""It is just correspondence and no one is concerned about the welfare of the poor animals,"" he added.
""The elephants are in this condition because of the tug of war among officials,"" he explained.
Food shortage
Sindh Local Government Minister Syed Nasir Hussain Shah, during his second visit to the zoo on Tuesday, denied claims that there was shortage of food for animals at the zoo. He said he was personally monitoring the situation. He also confirmed that the foreign vets were expected to visit the zoo.
""There is no shortage of food and funds,"" Hashmi said. He said that such issue had never happened. ""We have enough funds and the food supply has not even been stopped,"" he added.
Following videos of the sick elephants, there were reports that the contractor had stopped supplying food to the zoo as the in-charge was demanding bribes. 
On Saturday, Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori and Shah visited the zoo and directed the administration to ensure regular food supply to animals.
The photos shared with Tessori on daily basis confirmed the enough food for different animals and birds was being supplied.
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto junior
On Tuesday morning, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Jr visited the zoo and shared some videos and photos on his social media accounts.
On Wednesday, he writes on his twitter account that: ""Finally [I] was able to meet Noor Jehan and Madhu Bala at Karachi Zoo. The zoo is understaffed and under-funded - there is no malicious intent on the part of the staff. Rather the system is flawed: zoos are where animals die lonely deaths.""
In another tweet he said that: ""a Himalayan Brown Bear paces anxiously, bored out his/her mind. Unsure what to do in this tiny enclosure."" Fatima Bhutto, his sister, also twitted that: ""The Sindh government is so corrupt and incompetent they cannot even manage Karachi Zoo. It is an enclosure of suffering and death, no life no dignity.""
