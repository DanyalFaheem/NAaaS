0,Questionnaire sent to Imran in Toshakhana case,"NAB seeks answers to 12 questions, including sale receipts of gifts","The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has sent a questionnaire to former prime minister and PTI Chairman Imran Khan, seeking answers to 12 questions in the investigation of the Toshakhana case.
The anti-corruption watchdog has asked Imran for the sale receipts of the Toshakhana gifts. In the questionnaire, NAB asked: “How many times did you sell the gifts received from Toshakhana?”
It asked, “What items were sold, when and to whom did you sell the gifts? Were there any middlemen or women involved in these transactions? Provide details of everyone involved in the purchase and sale of the gifts.”
NAB also sought details of gifts allegedly sold at Islamabad’s F-7 shop.

It also sought details of the gifts were received by Imran when he was the prime minister.
“Were the proceeds from the sale of gifts deposited in a bank account or taken as cash?”
NAB also asked Imran for photos of gifts as evidence.
Warrants suspended
In the judge intimidation case, the district and sessions court in Islamabad suspended the non-bailable arrest warrant of Imran till Friday (today). Judicial Magistrate Malik Aman had issued warrants for Imran Khan for April 18.
Additional Sessions Judge Sikander heard the appeal of Imran. The court issued a notice to the parties, seeking their response till Friday.
During the hearing, Advocate Faisal Chaudhry said, “There are so many security concerns regarding Imran that the administration changed the court.”
He requested that Imran’s non-bailable arrest warrant be suspended.
Advocate Ali Bukhari said, “What happened a few days ago at the judicial complex should not be repeated anywhere.”
The decision of the sessions court on the bailable warrants was completely ignored and non-bailable warrants could not be issued at all.
He said, “Bailable arrest warrants are issued first, so the judicial magistrates should have issued bailable warrants first.”
Lawyer Bukhari read out the decision of suspending the ongoing warrant in Imran’s Toshakhana case.
Verdict reserved
The Islamabad High Court on Thursday reserved its verdict on the admissibility of a petition seeking the disqualification of Imran for concealing his alleged daughter, Tyrian White, in his election papers.

A three-member larger bench comprising Chief Justice Aamer Farooq, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and Justice Arbab Mohammad Tahir heard the case.
Advocate Hamid Ali Shah was present as the petitioner’s counsel while advocates Salman Akram Raja and Abuzar Salman as Imran representatives.
Advocates Saad Hasan and Zaigham Anees were present on behalf of the Election Commission of Pakistan.
Last year, petitioner Mohammad Sajid had filed a plea in the IHC claiming that although Imran made arrangements for Tyrian’s upkeep in the UK, he did not disclose it in his nomination papers filed for contesting the elections.
The former prime minister submitted his response to the IHC on Feb 1, requesting the court to dismiss the petition because it was “not maintainable” on legal grounds as he was no longer a lawmaker.
The IHC had decided to constitute a larger bench to hear the petition. On Feb 9, it had emphasised that arguments on the plea’s maintainability were of vital importance.
The IHC was to decide on the petition’s maintainability on March 21 but had adjourned the hearing till Thursday (March 30), directing Imran’s counsel to conclude his arguments on its maintainability.

2,Dissolution of bench makes no difference: Imran,PTI chief says Constitution is clear about holding elections within 90 days of dissolution of an assembly,"The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief Imran Khan has said it does not make any difference to his party whether a five-judge bench hears its plea against the polls supervisory authority’s decision to defer elections in Punjab till October or a full-court as the Constitution is clear about the matter.
“Whether it's a 5-member Supreme Court bench or full bench, it makes no difference to us because all we want to know is if elections will be held within the 90 days' constitutional provision,” the former premier said in a series of tweets on Wednesday.
Whether it's a 5 mbr SC bench or Full Bench, it makes no difference to us bec all we want to know is if elections will be held within the 90 days' constitutional provision. Before we dissolved our 2 Prov assemblies, I consulted our top constitutional lawyers, all of whom were
Imran took to micro-blogging site Twitter after a five-judge Supreme Court bench hearing the PTI’s plea against the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) decision to hold elections in Punjab in October instead of April was dissolved after recusal of a judge.
A day earlier—on Wednesday—the National Assembly unanimously passed the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure), Bill 2023, a piece of legislation that aimed at curbing the top judge’s suo motu powers.
On the same day, a three-judge SC bench had held that all all suo motu proceedings must be postponed until amendments are made in the Supreme Court Rules 1980 regarding the discretionary powers of the chief justice of Pakistan.
Imran said before dissolving the provincial assemblies of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P)–where the PTI was in power--in January this year, he had consulted with top constitutional lawyers, who were absolutely clear that the 90-day Constitutional provision about holding of elections was inviolable.
“Now [the] imported government of crooks, their handlers and a compromised ECP are making a complete mockery of the Constitution.
“By cherry picking which articles of the Constitution they will abide by, they are threatening the very foundation of Pakistan, which is the Constitution and rule of law.

“So petrified are they of elections and so desperate to whitewash their convicted leaders that they are prepared to destroy the Constitution and any semblance of the rule of law,” Imran wrote.
they are threatening the very foundation of Pakistan, which is the Constitution & Rule of Law. So petrified are they of elections & so desperate to whitewash their convicted ldrs that they are prepared to destroy the Constitution & any semblance of Rule of Law.
Meanwhile, former Punjab chief minister and PTI Central President Chaudhry Parvez Elahi said the government’s bill to clip the wings of the CJP is nothing but an uncouth attempt to give another NRO—reprieve— to former prime minister Nawaz Sharif.
“Nawaz Sharif is a fugitive criminal in the eyes of the Constitution and law. He will go straight to jail whenever he returns,” Elahi said while talking to a delegation at his residence.
An accountability court convicted Nawaz, the supreme leader of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), in December 2018 in Al Azizia reference and sentenced him to seven years in prison.
The former premier was, however, given a rare permission by the PTI led federal government in November 2019 to get treatment abroad in view of a debilitating medical condition. The PML-N leader has not returned to the country since despite repeated court orders.
Interestingly, the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure), Bill 2023, also allows Nawaz Sharif to file an appeal against the Supreme Court’s 2017 verdict that resulted in his lifetime disqualification.
Talking with reference to the new legislation, Elahi said the parliament is definitely the supreme but the government should know that the Supreme Court is also supreme and the parliament cannot dictate it.
“The entire Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, wants to stop the Supreme Court from following the Constitution. The PDM wants to shun elections in Punjab by entangling the Supreme Court in the debate of benches.”
He said according to the Constitution, only the Supreme Court of Pakistan has the authority to interpret the Constitution.
“The PDM government is playing with national security by delaying elections. The Supreme Court has repeatedly declared that malicious legislation has no constitutional status, even if it is passed by the parliament,” he added.

3,"Elections in K-P on Oct 8, announces ECP",Commission issues notification to convey its decision,"The Election Commission of Pakistan has notified October 8 as the date for elections in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.
The ECP conveyed its decision through a notification, dated March 27, available with The Express Tribune.
“In pursuance of [the] dissolution of [the] Provincial Assembly of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa on 18th January 2023, order dated 1st March 2023 passed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in Suo Motu Case No. [1] of 2023, Constitution[al] Petition No. [1] & 2 of 2023 and appointment of … date for the conduct of general elections to the Provincial Assembly of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa by the Governor Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa as 8th October, 2023, the Election Commission of Pakistan hereby notifies 8th October, 2023 as [the] poll[s] date for the General Elections to the Provincial Assembly of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa,” it read.
“The Election Programme for election[s] under Section 57(2) of the Elections Act, 2017 will be issued in due course of time,” it added.
On Friday, K-P Governor Haji Ghulam Ali had proposed the date of October 8 for elections in his province too.
He wrote a letter to Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja, fixing the date for the K-P Assembly election.
The governor also mentioned a deteriorating law and order situation in the province.
Last Wednesday, the ECP had delayed the election in Punjab until October 8 on the grounds that it could not conduct transparent and peaceful polls on the scheduled date of April 30.
In an eight-page order, the ECP said  it could not hold the elections in Punjab “honestly, justly and fairly in a peaceful manner due to security threats [and] in the absence of funds” and being unable to provide “level-playing field” to all political parties.
However, the PTI, which had dissolved its government in both the provinces in a bid to ratchet up pressures against the ruling coalition to announce early elections, moved the Supreme Court against the ECP’s move.
The party maintained that the ECP’s move “is in violation of the Constitution as well as the apex court order”.
The PTI petition added that the party has approached the SC as “the matter involved in the petition is of public importance with reference to enforcement of fundamental rights of the millions of people of Pakistan, particularly the people of Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa”.
A day earlier, Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial had observed that the ECP had no right to postpone the Punjab Assembly elections.
A five-member larger bench, headed by CJP Bandial, and comprising Justice Ijazul Ahsan, Justice Munib Akhtar, Justice Aminuddin Khan and Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail heard the case.
The PTI is likely to challenge the ECP’s decision to hold the elections in K-P in the SC as well.

4,Legal fraternity backs polls on time,Says ECP has no authority to go beyond constitutional time limits," 
The legal fraternity has passed a resolution backing the Supreme Court judgment to hold elections within 90 days while condemning those who violated the Constitution and “disobeyed” the apex court’s order.
The lawyers’ community passed the resolution at All Pakistan Lawyer’s Convention, which was held at the Lahore High Court.
The resolution consisting of eight points, added, “We fully support the interpretation of the Supreme Court regarding such provisions of the Constitution and demand ECP and other concerned constitutional authorities to implement the judgement of the Supreme Court in letter and spirit”.
“The ECP has no power and authority to postpone the elections beyond the time limits prescribed by the Constitution and its attempt to do so is clearly unconstitutional and highly condemnable,” the resolution stated.
The convention strongly condemned the attack on the Supreme Court judges for gaining political advantage and intending to violate the Constitution, it maintained.
The lawyers are deeply disturbed over the differences amongst the judges of the Supreme Court coming out so publicly because that can damage the sanctity and respect of the judiciary as a prime institution under the Constitution, the resolution mentioned.
The convention called upon the chief justice of Pakistan to exercise leadership by bringing all the judges of the Supreme Court on board to ensure that such differences are resolved amicably in the larger interest of the institution and that the dignity and integrity of the apex court is ensured.
According to the resolution, the convention called upon all the bar councils and bar associations throughout Pakistan to act independently without any pressure or under the influence of any political party or politician to ensure their independent stance and posture.
The lawyers vowed to stand united for the supremacy of the Constitution, rule of law and independence of judiciary.
Supreme Court Bar Association President Abid Zuberi, Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) President Ishtiaq A Khan and LHCBA Vice President Rabia Bajwa spoke on the occasion while Pakistan Bar Council member Shafqat Chohan and PTI leader Hamid Khan also addressed the lawyers.
