0,Banking lobby overpowers finance ministry,Decision to impose taxes on banks involved in currency manipulation still pending,"For over three months, the Ministry of Finance has been sitting on the central bank’s inspection report against commercial banks in a foreign currency manipulation case, delaying action against them despite clear incidences of charging ‘higher spreads.’
The action against at least eight commercial banks has been put on hold despite Finance Minister Ishaq Dar’s repeated vows to impose heavy taxes on the commercial banks for reportedly making exorbitant profits, taking Rs25 billion to Rs50 billion, by playing with the value of the rupee against the US dollar.
“The SBP has conducted a limited scope inspection of the matter and furnished its report to the Finance Division on December 27, 2022,” the central bank informed the Senate Standing Committee on Finance on Wednesday.
The date of submission of the report underscores that the federal government and central bank were deliberately delaying action against the banks. The federal government had an opportunity last month to slap additional taxes, through a mini-budget that it has been claiming to impose, in lieu of fines.
Nevertheless, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP)’s written reply to the committee gives the impression that the central bank was not in the mood to take any early decisive action against the commercial banks despite determining that they were over-charging.
“It was observed that the overall increase in foreign exchange (FX) income of the banks was mainly driven by higher spreads due to heightened volatility, however, in some cases, the banks charged higher spreads,” according to the SBP’s brief.
SBP’s Executive Director, Arshad Mahmood Bhatti, stated in the meeting that there was a shortage of dollars and importers were chasing the limited availability but “banks went beyond logical spread”.
Neither the SBP representative nor the Additional Secretary of Finance, Amjad Mehmood, gave a firm date for taking punitive action against the banks.
“SBP was in the process of imposing monetary penalties on the banks. However, the enforcement action was put on hold because of our understanding that the federal government was considering using a fiscal option with regard to high FX earnings of the banks,” according to the SBP’s written statement in the committee.
The central bank further stated that on March 21, the SBP sought clarity from the Ministry of Finance related to the government’s stance on the use of the fiscal option.
The finance ministry officials have been repeatedly saying that in order to recover around Rs37 billion in taxes, the government wanted to impose up to 41% additional income tax on the quantum of money that the banks made on FX income.
“If the government does not intend to proceed with the fiscal option, SBP will initiate enforcement action in accordance with its supervisory framework,” according to the SBP.
It added, however, that “Although the bank’s gross foreign exchange income increased significantly in the first half of 2022 as compared to the first half of 2021, allocation of the additional income to various components of foreign exchange business is quite difficult due to complexities involved in their calculations and record keeping.”
The SBP said that the banks record income from various components, like interbank transactions, transactions with customers, and FX derivative transactions under a single head of “FX Income” in their financial statements.
As such, it is difficult to ascertain the portion of FX income attributable to customer’s transactions alone, according to the central bank.
Further, the “FX income” is a gross income head, which does not include allied administrative, operating expenses and tax-related expenses, stated the SBP.
In September last year, the deputy governor of SBP had told the Senate Standing Committee on Finance that show-cause notices had been served to the National Bank of Pakistan, Allied Bank Limited, Bank Al Habib, Standard Chartered Bank, Meezan Bank, Habib Bank Limited, HabibMetro Bank and the United Bank Limited.
The allegation was that these banks quoted higher dollar rates to importers on some of the transactions and made substantial profits, according to the deputy governor. The banks quoted very high rates on some of the transactions, which created more volatility and uncertainty.
The hearing took place the day Pakistan’s rupee further shed its value to nearly Rs284 to a dollar on Wednesday.
The Additional Secretary of Finance, Amjad Mehmood said that the federal government was taking a cautious approach because any action will have an impact on the banking industry.
According to the SBP, the heightened volatility, uncertainty, short foreign exchange liquidity and short net open foreign exchange positions of the banks were the main reasons behind charging higher spreads during the May to August 2022 period.
To ensure that the banks follow a reasonable and transparent approach in pricing their transactions and to improve the market conduct in future, SBP held meetings with the banks and warned them about their practices and advised them to rationalise the spreads being charged to the customers, said SBP in a statement.

1,Currency dealers offer $24b in loans to govt,Believe financing will help country get rid of IMF programme,"Currency dealers in open market have offered loans of $24 billion to the government for the next two years to help it stay away from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, which has badly hit Pakistan’s economy.
Talking to The Express Tribune, Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP) President Malik Bostan said, “We have offered $1 billion a month in financing to the government for the next two years to get rid of the IMF.”
The government must pass an order to allow exchange companies to borrow US dollars directly from overseas Pakistanis, foreign firms and global exchange companies, he emphasised.
The loans will be free of cost and can be rolled over, if required. “We are in contact with millions of expatriate Pakistanis as they are our clients. They are ready to lend $1 billion a month to us (exchange companies) over the next 24 months, in addition to the usual inflows received by exchange companies.”
Bostan, along with other office-bearers of the association, floated the proposal in a meeting with Senate Standing Committee on Finance Chairman Saleem Mandviwala in Islamabad.
Central bank officers and other high officials were present in the huddle.
“Exchange companies are already supplying $300-400 million a month, totalling $4 billion a year, to the inter-bank market,” he revealed, adding that the IMF had continued to come up with new conditions one after another, making it tough for Pakistan to give a push to its economy.
He asked the government to further review its laws, rules and regulations for IT freelancers, who had deposits of billions of dollars in foreign banks. “If the regulations are softened, they will bring these deposits to Pakistan.”
In February 2023, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar gave the go-ahead to Saylani Welfare Trust to raise $2 billion from overseas Pakistanis.
On Wednesday, Pakistani rupee maintained its downtrend for the second consecutive day, dropping 0.13%, or Rs0.37, to a one-week low at Rs283.92 against the US dollar in inter-bank market. The rupee had closed at Rs283.55 to a dollar on Tuesday, according to the SBP.

2,China’s green loans exceed $3.2 trillion,"To reduce emissions, Beijing has lent 300b yuan via relending tool","China’s outstanding green loans currently exceed 22 trillion yuan ($3.2 trillion), accounting for about 10% of the country’s total loan balance, said Yi Gang, Governor of People’s Bank of China on Wednesday.
Separately, China’s green bonds have hit more than 2.5 trillion yuan, Yi said at the Boao Forum in southern China’s Hainan province.
“Achieving carbon neutrality requires ‘carrots and sticks’,” Yi said, adding that a central bank incentive mechanism, which provides commercial banks with loans with interest rates as low as 1.75%, could be equated to a “carrot”.
To support carbon emission reduction, the central bank has lent more than 300 billion yuan via a relending tool, which has helped banks to make 600 billion yuan in loans to green projects.
The central bank said in January it would keep the relending tool in place until the end of 2024.

3,Markets debate supply tightness,Oil edges slightly higher as a smaller-than-expected output cut in Russia offsets worries of tight supply,"Oil edged slightly higher on Wednesday as worries of tight supply after an unexpected draw in US oil stocks and a halt to some Iraqi Kurdistan oil exports were partially offset by a smaller-than-expected output cut in Russia.
Brent crude was up 27 cents, or 0.3%, to $78.91 a barrel at 1530 GMT, while West Texas Intermediate US crude rose 48 cents, or 0.7%, to $73.67.
US crude oil stockpiles fell unexpectedly last week, the EIA said on Wednesday, as refineries ramped up operations after maintenance season and US imports fell. 
The inventory data come as markets worry about supply tightness after exports of 450,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude from Iraq’s semi-autonomous northern Kurdistan region were halted on Saturday following an arbitration decision.
On Wednesday, Norwegian oil firm DNO said it had begun shutting down production at its fields in Kurdistan. The company’s Tawke and Peshkabir fields averaged output of 107,000 bpd in 2022, a quarter of total Kurdish exports.

4,China’s Alibaba to break empire,Splits into six units days after Jack Ma’s return to China,"Alibaba Group is planning to split into six units and explore fundraisings or listings for most of them, it said on Tuesday, in a major revamp as China vows to ease a sweeping regulatory crackdown and support its private enterprises.
The US-listed shares of the Chinese e-commerce conglomerate, which have lost nearly 70% of their value since the curbs were imposed in late 2020, rose more than 14%.
Alibaba said the biggest restructuring in its 24-year history will see it split into six units – Cloud Intelligence Group, Taobao Tmall Commerce Group, Local Services Group, Cainiao Smart Logistics Group, Global Digital Commerce Group and Digital Media and Entertainment Group.
The revamp comes a day after Alibaba founder Jack Ma returned home from a year-long stay abroad, a move that dovetailed with Beijing’s effort to spur growth in the private sector after two years of crackdown.
Analysts said the breakup could ease scrutiny over the tech giant whose sprawling business has been a target of regulators for years.
“The original intention and fundamental purpose of this reform is to make our organisation more agile, shorten decision making links and respond faster,” Chief Executive Daniel Zhang said in a letter to staff.
Each business group, he said, had to tackle the rapid changes in the market and each Alibaba employee had to “return to the mindset of an entrepreneur”.
Investors said the split signals the clearing of regulatory worries and allays concerns that Alibaba had lost the potential to grow.

5,Hinopak delivers profits amid era of downturn,Posts increase of 780 units compared to 663 units in previous year,"Despite a downturn in sales reported by every company in Pakistan’s auto sector, Hinopak has managed to sell more trucks and buses in the nine months of this year compared to the same period last year.
According to the company report to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) for the nine months ended December 31, 2022, the sale of Hinopak’s trucks and buses increased to 780 units from 663 units in the corresponding period of last year.
The total sale of commercial vehicles of all makes in the country during the period under review was 3,549 units – 11% lower than in the corresponding period of last year.
Sabir Shaikh, an expert in the automotive sector, noted that there is a significant demand for trucks and buses in Pakistan. “The country requires a large number of these vehicles, not only for general use but also for government projects that necessitate hundreds of trucks. In recent years, the government imposed a ban on imported vehicles, which has created an opportunity for domestic manufacturers like Hinopak,” he said.
“As a result, Hinopak has reported increased sales of trucks and buses, a trend that is expected to continue as the demand for these vehicles remains high,” added Shaikh.
The sales revenue for the nine months increased to Rs9.80 billion from Rs8.81 billion, the company earned gross profits of Rs815 million as compared to gross profit of Rs984 million in the corresponding period of last year.
However, the finance cost of the company stood at Rs158 million, including a net exchange loss of Rs143 million, in comparison with the finance cost of Rs119 million, including net exchange losses of Rs97 million in the corresponding period of the last year. The increase is mainly attributable to the devaluation of the rupee against the US dollar.
Despite the challenging business conditions resulting from high political unrest and economic crisis, the director of the company in the report mentioned that the management of Hinopak is committed to navigating this phase with grit and determination along with the support of stakeholders and business partners.
The company’s profit after tax stood at Rs10 million compared to profit after tax of Rs342 million in the corresponding period from last year, leading to earnings per share of Rs0.41. Last year, it stood at Rs13.77 earnings per share.
Hinopak’s ability to buck the trend and sell more trucks and buses amid a downturn in sales reported by the rest of the auto sector in Pakistan highlights the significance of the domestic market and the demand for commercial vehicles in the country. As the government continues to impose bans on imported vehicles, the opportunities for domestic manufacturers like Hinopak are expected to increase.

6,Legal lacunas stalling foreign investments,"Experts say Pakistan needs judicial reforms, consistent policies","The government needs to take urgent measures to stem declining foreign investment into the country and a key part of this should be judicial reforms, said experts on Wednesday, during a webinar titled ‘Pakistan’s Legal System and Challenges in Attracting Foreign Investment’.
“There has been a 40% decline, YoY, in foreign investment in the first eight months of the current fiscal year,” said TV journalist Talha Jatoi.
A recent example of a criminal case of defamation filed by former CEO of The Resource Group International Limited (TRG International) Zia Chishti, was cited by Jatoi, who pointed out that in a sexual harassment arbitration case in the US, Chisti was asked to pay over $5 million in damages. On the other hand, however, “in Pakistan he was able to get arrest warrants issued against the directors of a company that brings in millions of dollars in foreign exchange. Such cases send a very wrong signal to foreign investors.”
Karachi based journalist, Naimat Khan was of a view that the “Before looking to attract foreign investors, we need to encourage Pakistanis to invest locally rather than sending their funds overseas,” adding that, “Currently, Pakistan lacks both, security and an enabling environment.”
Lawyer Mirza Moiz Baig also spoke about the lack of arbitration and said much of the law followed in Pakistan dates back to the 1940s. “Consistent business policies are essential for sustained foreign investment,” he said. 
According to former intelligence officer and researcher Amir Mughal, “The country is run by a cabal of people and the policies being formulated by them are not very investment-friendly.” There was a general consensus that apart from much-needed judicial reform, it was imperative that there be political stability, and that policies needed to be consistent and long-term.

7,BRI is an opportunity for all countries: Iqbal,Federal minister says BRI provides developing countries with investment to fill economic gaps,"“The real beauty in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is the spirit of sharing, China shares its success with developing countries,” said Ahsan Iqbal, Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives, on Wednesday.
During the ongoing Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) Annual Conference 2023 in China, Iqbal said, “BRI welcomes everyone to jointly explore opportunities for shared growth and provides developing countries with the most critical investment to fill gaps in the economy.”
“For example, When Pakistan was only able to provide electricity for 16-18 hours a day, China-under the BRI-allowed its companies to invest in the energy sector when no other foreign investors were coming,” he said, adding that, “Over the years, China has actively shared its own successful development concepts, models, roads and plans, providing a broad cooperation platform for developing countries and helping promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.”
As for the future, Iqbal believes that the world is going through the process of Industry 4.0 and digitalisation.
If digitalisation is not caught up, the gap between rich and poor will widen. The high-tech companies and communication companies in BRI have boosted Pakistan’s digital development, enabling technology to enhance education and facilitate life.
Projects like this could provide lessons for other regions as they catch up on the digital wave, CEN reported.
“Among 100 people, 94 people can connect physically, but only 54 can connect to the Internet,” he said.
The federal minister hopes that BRI will help Pakistan introduce more high-tech and communication companies, providing more people with the possibility to gain digital connectivity.
The BFA Annual Conference 2023, held from March 28-31 in Boao, Hainan, is under the theme of “An Uncertain World: Solidarity and Cooperation for Development amid Challenges.”

8,Major relief in diesel price expected,Fuel cost may go down by Rs14.31 per litre for first fortnight of April,"A massive decline in the price of diesel in the global market may force the government to pass on a major relief to petroleum consumers for the first fortnight of April.
According to sources, the federal government may announce a substantial reduction of up to Rs14 per litre in ex-depot fuel prices based on the current petroleum levy and general sales tax, effective from April 1, 2023.
The price of high-speed diesel (HSD) is likely to go down by Rs14.31 per litre, a welcome relief for people in the current high inflationary environment.
Diesel is widely used in transport and agricultural sectors. Any reduction in its price will be particularly a good omen for farmers as the crop sowing season has kicked off.
If the government passes on full price relief to the consumers, diesel will cost Rs278.66 per litre compared to the existing price of Rs293 per litre.
Meanwhile, oil marketing companies are projecting a reduction of Rs3.51 per litre in the price of petrol.
Petrol is an alternative to the compressed natural gas (CNG), especially in Punjab where CNG outlets rely on imported gas. However, in the recent winter, LNG was not made available to them.
The government is currently working on a cross-subsidy programme worth Rs120 billion for petrol consumption. It is planning to charge owners of luxury cars a Rs50-per-litre higher price and provide price relief of an equivalent amount to the motorbikes and small cars.
Now, the government has an opportunity to slash the price of petrol to provide relief to the poor and lower middle-class consumers.
If the entire relief is passed on to the consumers, the price of petrol will drop to Rs268.49 per litre against the existing price of Rs272 per litre.
Similarly, the price of kerosene oil may fall by Rs13.46 per litre and light diesel oil (LDO) by Rs10.28 per litre.
Kerosene oil is an important household fuel because of its use for cooking and heating in remote areas. Its price may decrease from Rs190.29 per litre to Rs176.83 per litre. LDO price may decline to Rs174.40 per litre from Rs184.68 per litre.
The price calculation is based on the cost of supply borne by Pakistan State Oil (PSO). The government may allow exchange rate adjustment of Rs6 per litre on petrol and Rs15 per litre on HSD. In the past 13 days, the US dollar has appreciated by Rs4.66 against Pakistani rupee.
The government is required to increase petroleum levy on HSD by Rs5 to Rs50 per litre with effect from April 1 to meet a condition of the International Monetary Fund.
It has already been charging petroleum levy of Rs50 per litre on petrol since November 2022.

9,CPI may soar to 5-decade high,"Inflation likely to reach 35.8% in March , driven mainly by high food prices","Pakistan’s inflation reading is projected to hit over five-decade high at 35.8% in March 2023 mainly due to the surge in food prices at the start of Ramazan, setting the stage for another aggressive hike in the benchmark policy rate by two percentage points next week.
Ismail Iqbal Securities Head of Research Fahad Rauf said in a commentary that inflation would further spike to 38.3% in April.
“Inflationary pressures will persist in April as most of the impact of increase in Ramazan-related food prices and removal of wheat subsidy is yet to reflect in the (monthly) CPI inflation data.”
Domino-effect of increase in energy prices on businesses and households, massive rupee devaluation in the recent past and administrative control over imports have reduced the purchasing power of people in March as compared to the same month of previous year.
“Inflation is projected to reach 35.8% year-on-year in March compared to 31.5% in February,” the analyst said.
The 31.5% reading in February was a five-decade high. On a month-on-month basis, inflation is expected to be 4% higher in March following a 4.3% increase in February.
“The month-on-month surge came mainly in the wake of higher food prices and announcement of mini-budget (mainly increase in duty on cigarettes),” Rauf stated.
He noted that inflation in Pakistan had shot up to the highs where Sri Lanka nation defaulted on foreign debt repayment.
High inflation, coupled with the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) recommendation for rate hike, has set the stage for the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to increase its key policy rate by two percentage points to an all-time high of 22% early next month.
“Monetary policy committee (MPC) is scheduled to meet on April 4, where we expect the rate to further go up by 200 basis points to a new high of 22%, considering the inflation trend and the delay in IMF programme,” the analyst said.
Already the central bank had on March 2 jacked up the policy rate by 300 basis points to over 26-year high at 20%.
Another analyst said the other day the persistent increase in the policy rate had lately become ineffective in controlling inflation, which was soaring primarily due to high energy prices and rupee devaluation.
The central bank could control only demand-side inflation, but it could not restrict supply-side inflation like increase in energy prices, the analyst elaborated.
The rate hike has slowed down the economy, forced many businesses to temporarily shut production lines and rendered millions of workers jobless.
Rauf said that core inflation (non-food and non-energy) was expected to remain above 2% month-on-month, reflecting the impact of rupee devaluation, import restrictions and increase in goods prices.
“We estimate rural core inflation at 23.2% compared to 21.5% in February and urban core inflation at 17.9% compared to 17.1% in February.”
The research house’s inflation preview suggested that the food and non-alcoholic beverages inflation may have increased by 47.4% in March compared to the same month of previous year.
The largest increase of 155% was projected in the category of alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
In February, the government approved a significant increase in electricity prices in the range of Rs3.3 to Rs15.52 per unit for the residential consumers, farmers and exporters to collect an additional Rs237 billion over four months.
Besides, the rupee has depreciated by a massive 19%, or Rs54, in the past two months to around Rs284 against the US dollar compared to around Rs230/$ in late January 2023.
