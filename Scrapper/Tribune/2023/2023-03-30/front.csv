0,Senate approves SC bill amid protest,Top judge will be barred from suo motu notice in an individual capacity,"The Senate on Thursday passed the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure), Bill 2023 – aimed at curbing the top judge’s suo motu powers in an individual capacity amid protest by the opposition.
Sixty votes were cast in favour of the bill and 19 against it. Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar submitted a motion in the house to present the bill in the house, which met under the chairmanship of Sadiq Sanjrani.
The opposition’s motion to handover the bill to the standing committee was rejected whereas a motion to pass it immediately was approved.
Speaking in the house, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar -- who had moved the bill -- said that there were different attitudes towards running the institution.
""Under Article 191 of the Constitution, the parliament can amend the Constitution and the Constitution says not to interfere unnecessarily with each other's boundaries,"" he noted.
The law minister said that now “all supreme court judges are equal”. Observing that it was a long-standing demand, Tarar said, ""the voice came from the Supreme Court that an individual should not have the sole authority of the apex court"".
Moreover, the Lawyers Welfare and Protection Bill 2023 was also passed by a majority vote and the session was adjourned till 10:30am Friday (today).
PTI senators oppose bill
Senators of the PTI opposed the Supreme Court Practice and Procedure Bill 2023 and stood on their seats in protest.
The PTI senators raised slogans of ""attack on judiciary is unacceptable"" and surrounded the dais of the chairman. Moreover, a scuffle broke out between Senator Faisal Javed and Senator Bahramand Tangi.
Opposition senators from ex-Fata and Balochistan Awami Party also cast their votes in favour of the bill.
Opposition Leader in the Senate Shahzad Waseem of the PTI said that the scales of justice did not remain balanced after the passage of the bill.
Expressing his views in the Senate before voting, Tarar stressed that the system should be strengthened instead of empowering an individual.
He said a five-bench will be constituted where the interpretation of Constitution is required.
On Wednesday, the National Assembly had unanimously passed the bill that a committee comprising three senior-most judges of the apex court would decide on the suo motu notice, while there would be a right to file an appeal within 30 days on the suo motu decision.
The appeal has to be fixed for hearing within 14 days of filing and after the taking of a suo motu notice, the hearing will be conducted by a three-judge bench, the bill added.
It continued that the decision of the majority in the matter would be acceptable to all.
After the passage of the law, no decision of the apex court or high court, or any other legislation would be able to affect it.
Under the additional amendments, the right of appeal would be available in pending cases, while the bench formed on constitutional as well as legal matters would comprise at least five judges.
On March 28, the federal government had not only ruled that the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) can no longer constitute benches and initiate suo motu proceedings alone but had tabled the same bill curtailing unbridled powers of the top judge in the National Assembly for approval.
Things started unfolding quickly earlier this week as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif first addressed the National Assembly session, then the federal cabinet gave approval for the proposed bill – and finally the bill was tabled in lower house in the presence of the premier, who came back to attend the session after he chaired the cabinet meeting.

1,Riyadh signals readiness to provide more credit,Sources said IMF wanted $3b to be arranged from a combination of bilateral and commercial loans,"Pakistan claimed on Wednesday that it received an indication from Saudi Arabia for additional loans that may help to break gridlock with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and said that it was not planning to prematurely quit the $6.5 billion programme.
“We have received an indication from Saudi Arabia about getting something,” Dr Aisha Pasha, the Minister of State for Finance, said after attending a meeting of a parliamentary committee, without explaining the loan amount.
She also informed the Senate Standing Committee on Finance that some progress was made a day earlier on a friendly country deposit, saying, “we will soon reach the stage to sign the Staff-Level Agreement with the IMF”.
The IMF has asked Pakistan to arrange $6 billion in additional loans and at least half of those must be materialised before the board meeting. The funds are needed to avoid sovereign default and also increasing the foreign exchange reserves to a level sufficient to back 1.7 months of imports.
Pakistan had told the IMF that it would get $2 billion in additional loans from Saudi Arabia and $1 billion from the UAE to meet the additional financing requirements.
Hamad Obaid Ibrahim Salim Al-Zaabi, Ambassador of the UAE also called on Finance Minister Ishaq Dar. The finance minister highlighted various avenues in which both countries could enhance their existing trade and investment relations, according to the finance ministry handout.
Sources said the IMF wanted the $3 billion to be arranged from a combination of bilateral and commercial loans.
It is obvious that the foreign commercial banks will not lend until there is a staff-level agreement with the IMF, Dr Aisha said while responding to a question after the meeting.
The ninth review talks ended inconclusively on February 9 and since then Pakistani authorities had been claiming to close the deal with the IMF “in few days”.
Their relations soured after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif announced Rs50 per litre petrol subsidy on the advice of the Petroleum Division but without the endorsement of the finance ministry.
We are telling the IMF that Saudi Arabia and the UAE will come through for us and because of these two countries, Pakistan would soon reach the staff-level agreement stage, the state minister said. She said IMF was taking time to independently verify that from them.
People and the industry have suffered a lot because of increase in prices of electricity, gas, rupee devaluation and the mini-budget but still the government is not able to conclude a deal with the IMF, Senator Mohsin Aziz of the PTI said.
To a question whether there was a fallback option if the IMF deal does not materialise, Dr Aisha said, “government is not even contemplating without an IMF scenario”.
She once again reiterated that the business as usual approach will not work and the structural reforms will have to be introduced to win the trust of the IMF.
Pakistan’s credibility has become too low in the eyes of the IMF because of the past experiences, thus, the Fund is asking to take prior actions, Dr Aisha said.
She said Pakistan has met all the prior actions and the only remaining touch point is the external financing gap.
Malik Bostan, a representative of the foreign exchange companies, claimed before the committee that he could arrange foreign funds to address Pakistan’s external sector woes.
The exchange companies can provide $1 billion interest-free per month to the government for a two-year period with the help of the overseas Pakistanis, Bostan said. He also demanded a licence for doing Hawala business – which is currently an illegal activity.
Bostan, who was invited by the standing committee, also sought exemption from the condition of CNIC on selling up to $15,000 by the customers.
At a time when the finance ministry is already struggling to restore the IMF programme, an ill-prepared fuel subsidy scheme created more troubles for the Q Block.
Petrol subsidy is the idea of the Petroleum Division and the scheme is not designed yet, Dr Aisha said while responding to a question.
She said the IMF was only in favour of the targeted subsidy. If it is plausible, targeted and executable only then the IMF will not have an issue with the petrol subsidy, the state minister observed.
It seems the minister of state for petroleum prematurely announced the Rs50 per litre subsidy last week in a news conference.
Senator Farooq H Naek of the PPP also criticised the government’s untargeted and highly mismanaged wheat flour scheme, which he said had taken lives of people.
Dr Aisha said the Punjab government could not effectively implement the wheat flour subsidy scheme.

2,LHC strikes down ‘sedition' law,"Section 124-A of PPC that stops criticism of govt, other state institutions declared unconstitutional","Lahore High Court’s Justice Shahid Karim struck down Section 124-A of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), 1860 -– the “sedition” law -- declaring it as ultra vires of the Constitution.
The judge announced the decision which he had reserved after hearing detailed arguments on different petitions.
The petitioners had requested the court to strike down the law, arguing that it was not only contrary to the Constitution, but also against its “real essence”.
The lawyers representing the federation fiercely opposed the arguments of the petitioners lawyers, contending that this section was about “whoever by words, either spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise, brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards, the federal or provincial government established by law shall be punished”.
They added that Section 124-A of the PPC was used in accordance with the law to restrain any person from resorting to these offences.
However, the petitioners' lawyers argued that the use of this section was tantamount to depriving the people of their basic right of freedom of expression.
“The instant petition calls in question the constitutionality, validity, reasonability, relevance and legitimacy of Section 124-A of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 which criminalises 'Sedition’,” read one of the pleas.
“It is most respectfully submitted that Section 124-A [of the] Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 is an unconstitutional [law] and ultra vires [of the] the Constitution as [it] brazenly and patently contravenes Article 8, 9, 14, 16, 17, 19 & 19-A of the Constitution,” it continued.
The petition added that since 1947, Section 124-A of the PPC, otherwise known as the sedition law, had been recklessly used in Pakistan as a tool of exploitation to curb the right to free speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19 of the Constitution.
“Section 124-A of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 is an illegitimate limitation and restriction on the legitimate, legal and lawful exercise of constitutionally guaranteed right of free speech and expression (in particular) and various other constitutional freedoms (in general),” the plea read.
Over the past few years various politicians, journalists and activists have been booked under Section 124-A of the PPC.
With each passing day, the intensity of registration of FIRs under Section 124-A is increasing.
The citizens of Pakistan have suffered a lot as almost every criticism of the government or any state institution has been treated as an offence under Section 124-A by the law enforcement agencies.
The plea contended that in a nutshell, Section 124-A was serving as a notorious tool for the suppression of dissent, free speech and criticism in a “free and independent” Pakistan.
Petitioner Haroon Farooq mentioned some lawmakers presently facing cases under the sedition law including MNAs Mohsin Dawar and Ali Wazir from the tribal districts, PTI leader Shahbaz Gill as well as various prominent journalists and civil rights activists.
The petitioners contended that most of these cases were politically motivated and based on vague, ambiguous, and uncertain allegations as well as subjective understanding and interpretation of the sedition law by the law enforcement agencies.
They requested the court that Section 124-A should be declared as ultra-vires in terms of Article 8 of the Constitution.
They claimed that it was inconsistent with and in derogation of fundamental rights provided under Article 9, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 19, 19A of the Constitution.
“In the interim and during pendency of the instant petition, the respondents may kindly be restrained from registering any FIRs, or undertaking any coercive measure in sedition cases under Section 124-A [of the] PPC,” the plea concluded.

3,Bench hearing poll delay disbanded,Apex court to form new bench to hear PTI plea after Justice Aminuddin recuses himself,"In a significant development, an apex court bench hearing the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s (PTI) plea against postponement of provincial assembly elections in Punjab stands dissolved after a member of the bench recuses himself from hearing the case.
A five-judge bench of the Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial, was formed to hear the PTI’s petition against the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) March 22 notification, announcing postponement of elections in Punjab, earlier scheduled for April 30.
The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) led federal government had demanded formation of a full court to decide the matter while some key leaders of the ruling party had openly criticized some senior judges including the CJP for their alleged impartiality.
The government had also hurriedly drafted the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure), Bill 2023, a piece of proposed legislation that aimed at curbing the top judge’s suo motu powers. The bill sailed through both the National Assembly and the Senate respectively on March 29 and March 30.
On Wednesday—March 29—an SC bench held that all cases that various Supreme Court benches were hearing under Article 184 (3) of the Constitution be postponed until amendments are made in the Supreme Court Rules 1980 regarding the discretionary powers of the CJP.
The three-judge led by Justice Qazi Faez Isa and comprising Justice Aminuddin Khan and Justice Shahid Waheed issued the verdict with a vote of 2 to 1 with the dissenting note by Justice Waheed.
On Thursday, when the five-judge bench resumed hearing of the polls postponement case Justice Aminuddin Khan—who had endorsed Justice’s Isa’s ruling on Wednesday—announced that he wanted to recuse himself from hearing the case.
“I recuse myself from hearing this case in view of yesterday's verdict,” he said.
Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, another member of the bench, also wanted to say something but the other judges suddenly left the courtroom after Justice Khan's recusal. The bench also included Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Munib Akhtar.
At the last hearing—on Wednesday— CJP Bandial had asked the interior and defence ministries to give a timeframe for improving the security situation. While postponing the polls, the ECP had cited deteriorating security situation as well as lack of funds as reasons for its move.
In response to the claims made by the government regarding financial difficulties to hold timely elections, Justice Bandial on Tuesday also proposed that the salaried class, including judges, could take a five per cent pay cut to fund the polls.
The government does not have money to hold separate elections in provinces but it has the money to conduct joint elections, he had observed.
Justice Bandial had also noted that the ECP did not have any right or legal backing to extend the election date till Oct 8 and asked Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan to get instructions from the federal government in this regard.
During the hearing, Justice Mandokhail had, however, cast aspersions at the apex court’s March 1 order, stating that the case was dismissed by a majority of 4 to 3 and that the CJP had not issued an “order of the court”.
Justice Mandokhail said that according to him, the verdict of the four judges in the suo motu case was the “order of the court”. He had questioned how the president could give a date for the polls and the ECP issue an election schedule if an order had not been issued.
He noted that the four judges, who had issued dissenting notes in the suo motu case, were his “brothers”. The PPP’s counsel had demanded that a full court bench be formed to hear the case.
Justice Mandokhail had, however, asked why a full court should be summoned, adding that the same seven-judge bench should hear the case. The PPP’s lawyer had argued that the ongoing situation called for the formation of a full-court bench, adding that the nation was “confused”.
He added that clarification was required on the SC’s March 1 verdict. CJP Bandial had asked the counsel to submit a written request to the court.
Election on same day
Meanwhile, a petition has been filed in the Supreme Court for holding elections of the National Assembly and all provincial assemblies on one date.  The petition has been moved by Malik Faisal Mahmood through Advocate Malik Kabir.
The petitioner said the idea to hold general elections early should be discouraged as it would entail curtailing tenure of three assemblies.
