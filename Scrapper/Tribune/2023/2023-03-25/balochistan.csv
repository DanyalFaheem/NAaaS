5,Imran’s nephew handed over to Quetta police,"Vandalism, rioting case against PTI activists shifted to CTD","A district and sessions court in Islamabad on Friday approved a one-day transit remand of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan’s nephew and focal person Hassaan Khan Niazi to the Quetta police.
After the transit remand was approved, Quetta police took Niazi to Balochistan.
Sources said that a case had been registered against Hassan Niazi at the Airport police station in Quetta for inciting violence and interfering in government affairs.
Quetta police reached the district and session courts in Islamabad to arrest Hassan Niazi. Judicial Magistrate Abbas Shah issued a warrant for Hassan Niazi's arrest. Later, Hassan Niazi was presented in court. Quetta police requested a one-day physical remand of Hassan Niazi, which the judicial magistrate accepted. After which, he was handed over to Quetta police.
The court told the Quetta police's investigation officer to present Hassan Niazi in the relevant court on March 25.
On March 18, a case was filed against Hassan Niazi at the Quetta Airport police station on charges of inciting violence and interfering with police affairs on a complaint of Inspector Abdulllah of the Airport police station in Quetta.
The case stated that while on patrol, the sub-inspector got the information that 150 people had blocked Chaman Road in Quetta, including Inayatullah Kakar and others. 
The demonstrators blocked the road for one hour despite police’s attempt to disperse them. It should be noted that Hassan Niazi was not nominated in the FIR by the Quetta police.
Quetta police took custody of Hassan Khan Niazi and left for Balochistan after the judicial magistrate in Islamabad approved a one-day transit remand.
Niazi was taken into custody by police outside the Judicial Complex in Islamabad on Monday for his involvement in attacking law enforcement personnel and causing chaos in the federal capital. The arrest is part of an ongoing crackdown on PTI activists and supporters who police claim assaulted law enforcers while they were performing their duties in Islamabad.
On Thursday, the district and sessions court in Islamabad sent Hassan Niazi to jail on a 14-day judicial remand in a case related to clashes between PTI workers and Islamabad police outside the Federal Judicial Complex during the court appearance of the former prime minister in the Toshakhana case.
The local court had rejected the police’s plea seeking further physical remand of Hassan Niazi as the police failed to recover anything from the suspect during the investigation after taking him into custody.
Hassan Niazi was arrested in a separate case as he was leaving the Federal Judicial Complex after obtaining pre-arrest bail in three cases.
On Thursday, Hassan Niazi was produced in the court of Duty Magistrate Mureed Abbas in District and Sessions Court Islamabad after the expiry of his two-day physical remand.
The investigating officer pleaded to the court to grant a further five-day physical remand of Hassan Niazi. The investigating officer said that the co-accused has been identified while Hasan Niazi's arms and vehicle were to be recovered.
The PTI lawyers said that more than 72 hours had passed since his arrest but the police could not recover the (said) weapon.
The PTI counsel raised the question that if the arms and vehicle were not in possession of the police, then why have they detained Hassan Niazi?
Lawyer Faisal Chaudhry said that the police failed to trace the vehicle and its owner in the last 72 hours. He said that Hassan Niazi is a professional lawyer and he obtained three bails on the day of his arrest.
After hearing the arguments of the parties, Duty Magistrate Mureed Abbas reserved the verdict on the plea for the extension in the physical remand of Hassan Niazi. Later, the court announced the reserved verdict, rejecting the police plea for further physical remand of Hassan Niazi. The court issued an order to send him to jail on a 14-day judicial remand.

7,‘Culprits conspiring against army be brought to justice’,Senator Siddiqui said that PTI was targeting the army not only within the country but also at the international level,"Elements behind an organised conspiracy against the Pakistan army should be brought to justice, said Senator Irfan Siddiqui on Friday.
Talking to journalists at the Parliament House, the senator said that the army’s interference in political affairs, imposition of martial laws and those generals who abrogated the constitution have always been criticised.
“This has been a major cause of the current crisis, but now the PTI has targeted the Pakistani army as an institution,” he said.
“The incumbent army chief, who was targeted before his appointment, still remains the target of smear campaigns,” he said.
In response to a question, Senator Siddiqui said that the PTI was targeting the army not only within the country but also at the international level. The protest outside the British Prime Minister's residence and other places was part of the same plan.
He said letters are being sent to United Nations and other organizations and they have hired firms for propaganda.
Siddiqui said that PTI leaders are reaching out to diplomats in Islamabad to make them believe that the army is trampling on basic human rights through the government, and that the army is responsible for whatever is happening in the country.
Senator Siddiqui said that targeting the army as an institution and accusing its chief is equivalent to playing with national defense.

9,Pindi spring festival called off after police raid,"Police register FIR, arrest 18 for spreading ‘obscenity’ at ‘Maut ka kuwaan’","The Rawalpindi spring festival (Jashan-e-Baharan Mela) under the Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA) was called off after police raided the event, claiming that “nudity” was being spread in the name of entertainment at the “well of death” (Maut ka kuwan).
The cancellation of the event cost millions of rupees to the PHA, which had been making preparations for the public mela, being held after a hiatus of almost three years. The event could not be held after the outbreak of the coronavirus in 2020.
Sources confirmed that the festival was to be inaugurated on March 19 at 7 pm as per the schedule, but on March 18, the New Town Police Station Aizaz Azeem and his team raided the event on March 18, forcing the contractor to wrap up his belongings including equipment and the “well of death” and flee.
 Later, the PHA administration attempted to reopen the mela on March 21 but the contractor refused to come back with the entertainment equipment.
After the contractor’s refusal, the festival was cancelled and folk singers, who had been invited to the festival, were informed not to show up for the event. A Sufi night and a flower exhibition were also scheduled to be held but they had to be cancelled, the sources said.
According to the sources, the New Town police registered a case and arrested around 18 employees working at the “well of death” on charges of spreading nudity and obscenity.
Confirming the cancellation of the mela, PHA spokesperson Naina Asharq said that the termination was a sad thing that it would provide good entertainment to the citizens and the best arrangements had been made.
She said that the contractor had made a lot of investment for the festival. The spokesperson denied that any obscenity was being spread saying it was pure entertainment.
The spokesperson also said that the rain also spoiled the event. She said that they will try to arrange the festival after Eid-ul-Fitr.
She said that earlier the coronavirus stopped them from holding the event and last year, the political situation of the city affected the festival.
“This time around, the police raided and the rain did not allow the fair to take place. Preparations for this fair had been going on for a month-and-a-half,” the PHA spokesperson said.
Meanwhile, New Town SHO Aizaz Azeem said that the police duty officer was informed that gambling was under way at the well of death. He claimed that the gambling was going on despite a ban.
He said that Jashn-e-Baharan Mela should be held according to rules and a no-objection certificate should be obtained from all authorities concerned.
“How can transgenders’ dance and display of weapons be allowed in the name of Jashn-e-Baharan Mela,” he said.
With the abrupt end of the festival, the citizens of Rawalpindi were once again deprived of entertainment.
The PHA had organised the festival at the Allama Iqbal Park Rawalpindi, where private companies had installed stalls of food and drink items.
