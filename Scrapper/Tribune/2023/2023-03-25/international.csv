0,PML-N nearly extinct from Sindh,Thebo says party’s suppression during Musharraf era was to blame for its current lack of political clout in Sindh,"Despite it having hopes of forming an independent government at the centre, the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) has not made any effort to attract voters in provinces other than Punjab; even when its popularity has been dented by a resurgent Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). 
For the past decade, the PML-N’s laser focus on Punjab has resulted in it ceding valuable political space to other political parties in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), Balochistan, Sindh, Gilgit-Baltistan (G-B), and Azad Jammu Kashmir (AJK). While the party may still have a political presence in the other provinces, in Sindh it has next to no political clout left - evidenced by the fact that it has no national or provincial assembly representatives from the province and only managed to bag 7 Union Council seats from Karachi in the recently held local bodies elections. However, senior journalist and political analyst, Mazhar Abbas, feels that the PML-N’s focus on Punjab at the expense of becoming irrelevant in other provinces is a carefully thought out party policy. “Punjab is mini-Pakistan, so parties like the PML-N and now the PTI know they only have to carve out big wins in the province to form a government in the centre,” he opined. “As far as the PML-N is concerned, ever since Maryam Nawaz has been appointed Chief Organiser, she has not come out of Punjab, which means that the PML-N is content with being a provincial party.” 
Abbas feels that the strategy adopted by Maryam Nawaz, wherein she is fixated on one province, is against the spirit of politics. “There is a huge political vacuum in Sindh as a vast majority of the populace is not happy with the performance of the incumbent Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) government. Hence, the PML-N leadership should focus on re-organising their party in Sindh, so they can pick up valuable national or provincial assembly seats,” the veteran journalist suggested. 
However, the infighting in the PML-N’s Sindh chapter, which resulted in an attack by some party workers on the Muslim League House at Karsaz, makes it unlikely that the party will heed to the political analyst’s advice. “Karachi based party leaders are not happy with the appointment of Shah Mohammad Shah as the Sindh chapter’s President,” informed a senior PML-N leader, on the condition of anonymity. “Even though Shah was elected unopposed back in 2018; after his election it has been hard to convene the provincial chapter’s meetings and to evolve consensus on political activities,” the PML-N leader added. 
When asked about the infighting in the party’s Sindh chapter, Sorath Thebo, Additional Joint Secretary of PML-N Sindh, did not acknowledge that there were any differences. She was of the view that the party’s suppression during the General Musharraf era was to blame for its current lack of political clout in Sindh. “Our leadership has been dealing with politically motivated cases for years now. If our entire energy is invested in defending ourselves in court, how will we spare time for political activism in the province?” retorted Thebo, while talking to The Express Tribune.

2,Official assignee declines to re-conduct CCE 2020 exams,SHC refers judgment of nullifying the results to chief justice,"The official assignee of the Sindh government, Chaudhry Waseem Iqbal, has declined to supervise the re-conduct of the Combined Competitive Exams (CCE) 2020, as ordered by the Sindh High Court on February 23. 
In view of his reluctance, the SHC referred the said judgment, which nullified the results of CCE-2020 and directed Sindh Public Service Commission (SPSC) to conduct the exam again within two months, to the SHC chief justice.
""Learned official assignee has shown reservations, which itself is a creation of the Insolvency Act and being an employee of the Sindh government, is unable to perform the designated task entrusted to him,"" reads the order. ""... it would amount to reviewing the order whereby a number of tasks have been assigned to him.""
As per the February 23 order, and other similar orders dated November 9, 24, 25, 2020, as well as February 3 and 17, the official assignee and additional registrars of the SHC's benches in Hyderabad, Sukkur and Larkana were to supervise the exams. It was one of these officials, the additional registrar SHC Hyderabad, who unearthed tampering in the re-assessment of the answer sheets which led to cancellation of the results of that exam.
Keeping in view the urgency of the matter, the SHC directed the registrar to place the matter in question before the SHC chief justice within a week or at the earliest possible time. 
The SHC had also sought action against the officers found involved in tampering the CCE 2020 results following which the provincial government suspended five officers of SPSC and initiated inquiries.

3,Movement of wheat from Umarkot banned,"Sindh Food Department has set up wheat procurement centres at Kunri, Barani and Muhammad Khan Chandio areas of Umarkot","The administration has imposed a ban on the movement of wheat from Umarkot district as the fresh harvest reached the market and hoarders became active.
Wheat crop was cultivated on thousands of acres of land in Umarkot district this season, according to officials. Harvesting of the ripe crop has already begun and fresh wheat has started arriving in the market. 
The Sindh Food Department has set up wheat procurement centres at Kunri, Barani and Muhammad Khan Chandio areas of Umarkot. The department has set a target of procuring 50,000 wheat bags at Kunri, 10,000 bags at Barani, and 10,000 bags at Muhammad Khan centres. 
As soon as fresh wheat harvest started reaching the market, the hoarding mafia became active. Hoarders purchase wheat from growers in their fields and stock it up in their warehouses instead of bringing it into the market. 
Although fresh wheat harvest has started arriving in the market, there has been no drop in the price of flour which is still being sold for Rs4,800 to Rs5,000 per 40kg. 
In order to keep the prices in check and ensure its availability, the Mirpurkhas Division commissioner has placed a ban on the movement of wheat out of Umarkot district through a notification.

6,SHC tells cops to stop being rude on roads,Court also unhappy with security provided to judges,"The Sindh High Court (SHC) instructed the Sindh police chief to take action against police highhandedness with citizens while hearing a petition of Leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh.
A two-member bench headed by Justice Muhammad Iqbal Kalhoro heard the case related to the provision of security to Sheikh as opposition leader.
During the hearing, Justice Kalhoro observed that police and private guards misbehave with citizens on the roads. Is this a security state or a welfare state, the jurist remarked. 
Justice Kalhoro verbally instructed the IGP to conduct an awareness campaign and adopt measures to bring an end to this culture. Karachi is notorious for menacing guards or policemen sitting in the backseat of a vehicle flinging their weapons asking drivers to either make way or steer clear. 
Justice Kalhoro, in a conversation with SSP Security, said that the squad accompanying police officers also misbehaved with citizens. Civilians are rudely ordered to move aside, he remarked.
He then added that the security provided to judges was inadequate, remarking that some of those don't even know how to use a gun. The court remarked that the policemen provided to judges for security were often those nearing retirement. 
All the commandos are in the squad of police officers, Justice Kalhoro remarked. 
He observed that landlords (waderas) had private security, who also made gestures like policemen. Who will stop all these actions, he inquired. 
Opposition leader
While hearing about Sheikh's counsel about his concerns over security, the judge remarked that he could afford to hire guards.
The lawyer argued that security was the right of the opposition leader in law. He added that 31 cases were registered against his client. 
Justice Kalhoro told the lawyer not to waste the court's time with such details and tell it what the law states on the issue. 
The SSP told the court that there was shortage of police personnel and they could not provide security to Sheikh, who is a member of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf. 
The court told the two parties to find a solution while hiring private guards in the interim. Shaikh told the court that the rules of the Sindh Assembly have a provision on security. The court instructed Shaikh's lawyers to provide details while adjourning the hearing till March 30. 
The application states that opposition leader is the most important position after that of chief minister. It contends that Shaikh has not been provided adequate security. It adds that Shaikh's life in danger while seeking increasing security.

7,Action against FIA inspector after bribery complaint,"Hanif admitted to previously giving Mohmand Rs1 million, business class plane tickets and six bottles of whiskey","An inspector of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Karachi was sent to the administrative department following a complaint by a builder that he was demanding bribes.
Aziz Hanif, who runs a real estate and construction business, wrote to the head of the agency stating that Inspector Mansoor Mohmand had demanded a cut in each of his projects in lieu of his 'protection'. 
He said that Mohmand was his father's friend and would take money from his father, including airline tickets. He wanted to continue the same practice with him. Hanif said that the inspector had threatened to implicate him and his family in a slew of hawala-hundi and cybercrime case unless he was paid the 'protection money'.
When he refused, the inspector sent him a bullet in an envelope through his henchman Javed, the complaint states.
Hanif admitted to previously giving Mohmand Rs1 million, business class plane tickets and six bottles of whiskey.
However, the inspector continued with his excessive demands until he found an ex-director of the FIA who intervened on his behalf. But that didn't stop the Mohmand from harassing him, and he started calling him again with threats. The complaint adds that Mohmand's asset were beyond the means of a grade-16 officer. It said that he had multiple properties but he was not questioned as he had the support of high-ranking personnel.
FIA Karachi Director Abdul Salam Shaikh said that the inspector had been removed from the operational post and would be officer on special duty pending an inquiry.
