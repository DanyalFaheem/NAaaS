3,Banks to remain open on weekend for Hajj application,Religious affairs ministry spokesperson says decision taken in view of paucity of time and large number of applicants,"The religious affairs ministry on Friday announced that the 14 designated banks collecting Hajj applications across the country would remain open on the weekend – Saturday and Sunday (March 25 and 26).
Ministry spokesperson Muhammad Umar Butt told APP that the decision had been taken in view of the paucity of time and due to a large number of people, who intended to submit their Hajj applications and dues in the banks during the off days.
“It will also help the overseas Pakistanis apply under the Sponsorship Hajj Scheme, which takes almost two to three business days to transfer funds from abroad in the foreign currency account of the religious affairs ministry,” he said.
Butt said that in response to a ministry’s letter, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) had advised the designated financial institutions to remain open from 9am to 2pm on this particular weekend for smooth sailing of Hajj operation.
Informing about Hajj application receipts, Butt said the ministry had received more than 26,000 applications by March 22.
Under the sponsorship scheme, the number of applicants seeking foreign exchange from abroad had increased to more than 2,000, he added.
He said that the overseas Pakistanis could also submit a health certificate issued from abroad in the bank or they could furnish a medical fitness certificate before their Hajj flight. He added those who had not yet received the coronavirus vaccine, could also submit the application.
“However, they will have the full dose of the vaccine and submit the certificate to the banks before their departure to Saudi Arabia. Apart from NADRA [National Database and Registration Authority], a foreign vaccine certificate would also be acceptable,” he maintained.
Butt made it clear that it was not necessary for the person sending sponsorship to have a blood relation with the pilgrim. But, he added, it was essential to send the name, Computerised National Identity Card number, and contact number of the pilgrim along with the money, he added.
Butt said that overseas applicants under the regular scheme should submit their applications in the bank through their nominated persons here in Pakistan, adding that in order to receive the possible savings in the package, they needed to open a bank account after arriving in Pakistan.

4,Armed forces team attends SCO Delhi huddle,Development increases chances of defence minister travelling to India next month,"A Pakistani delegation, comprising officers from the three armed forces, attended a working group meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in New Delhi, the Foreign Office on Friday confirmed, raising the possibility of the defence minister travelling to the neighbouring country next month.
India, being the current president of the SCO, is holding a series of meetings this year.
It has invited Pakistani defence and foreign ministers for the SCO meetings scheduled in April and May, respectively.
The FO spokesperson told reporters  that no final decision had been made  on the invitations yet.
However, Mumtaz Zahra Baloch  confirmed that a Pakistani delegation  from the Joint Staff Headquarters attended a meeting of the expert working group under the Council of Ministers of Defence of the SCO.
“Pakistan is an active member of the SCO and will continue to engage with it. Regarding that unfortunate development last week, we have expressed our concerns with the SCO and our point has been well registered with the entire organisation,” she said while referring to the India cancelling the Pakistani invitation for a meeting of military experts on ‘healthcare and pandemics’.
“Regarding future meetings, I cannot predict how things would develop, but I can share with you that yesterday [Thursday] a delegation of Pakistan from the Joint Staff Headquarters attended the 16th meeting of the expert working group under the Council of the Ministers of Defence of SCO member states. It was a working level delegation that attended in-person,” she added.
This was the first SCO meeting, where Pakistan attended the huddle in person.
It earlier attended the chief justices conference as well as the energy ministers meeting via video link.
Although the final decision on the participation of Pakistan in the SCO defence and foreign ministers meetings has not been taken yet, Islamabad is actively considering the invitation.
As the SCO is a regional forum having China and Russia as its members too, one view within the Foreign Office is that Pakistan must not leave such key forums, allowing India an opportunity to score points.
India is also scheduled to host a summit meeting in June.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is likely to be invited.
It is believed some friendly countries are making fresh efforts to open a channel of communications between Pakistan and India.
However, because of the uncertain political situation in Pakistan, matters are not proceeding forward.
If Pakistan attends the defence and foreign ministers meetings and later a summit of the SCO, it  will be seen as major ice-breaking development although it may not have an immediate impact on the bilateral relationship.

“We will also continue to extend political, diplomatic, and moral support to our Kashmiri brothers and sisters for the just and peaceful settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with the UN Security Council Resolutions.""
""Last week in Srinagar in IIOJK, India's National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested senior journalist and human rights defender, Irfan Meraj. We are concerned about the safety and well being of Irfan Meraj and dozens of Kashmiri journalists and human rights defenders, including Khurrum Perviaz, who are under incarceration in prisons across IIOJK and India.""
""They are prisoners of conscience who are being victimized for shining a spotlight on the dire situation of human rights and fundamental freedom in IIOJK. We urge India to bring an end to the suppression of journalists and human rights defenders and to its policy of stifling freedom of expression and assembly in the occupied territory,"" she added.
