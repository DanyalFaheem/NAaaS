0,Islamia College on the brink of collapse,"Robberies, protests and other issues haunt the reputation of the institution","While most would expect classical educational institutions to act as torch bearers for the advancement of the nation, the deplorable state of affairs at the Islamia Colleges in the provincial capital, presents a gloomy picture.
Established in the 20th century in Peshawar, the Islamia College, had historically played a key role in advancing the Independence movement in the subcontinent and had also nurtured the political ethos of various ruling elites in the early years of Pakistan. Concurrently, its daughter institution, the Jamia Usmania, known popularly as the “mother of knowledge”, was also widely revered for having produced many accomplished alumni, who dutifully served the nation.
In recent times however, the two institutions have caught the public eye for all the wrong reasons. With regular student and faculty protests, frequent robberies and occasional murders, the colleges have lost their appeal to prospective students and have, in no time, turned into sites of widespread social chaos.
“The good reputation of the Islamia College has long gone”, resented Izhar Ullah, a senior alumni. “Given daily protests, student clashes and crime occurrences, regular classes no longer take place. If the current situation persists, soon enough no parent would want to send their child for studying here,” he added.
According to the President of the Peshawar University Teachers Association, Dr Muhammad Uzair, poor administrative structures and inadequate vigilance are paramount factors behind the worsening law and order atmosphere on the campuses. “The administration does not monitor the conduct of classes nor does it guarantee the availability of the 350 members of the teaching faculty,” said Uzair. “Nor does the vigilance invest in installing modern surveillance equipment, like security cameras, in order to keep check on student activity and curb the crime rate,” he added.
Apart from this, Uzair also cited meagre salaries of the teaching faculty as being a major factor behind regular faculty-led protests.
While some blame the administration for the deteriorating state of affairs, others cite nepotism in the government as being another major cause. As Shah Nawaz, a teacher at the Islamia College and member of the Islamia College Teachers Association, told The Express Tribune, “The government appoints the Vice Chancellor of the Islamia College based on its preferences and personal favorites and seldom takes into account the qualifying credentials of the appointee.”
Furthermore, Nawaz, revealed that majority of the appointed administration is from far flung areas and is ill-prepared for dealing with the local realities on campus. He also highlighted the recent murders on campus as being another factor contributing to the rising notoriety of the institution.
Indeed, the recent ironic murder of a professor by a security guard at the Islamia College and the murder of a security personnel at the Jamia Usmania, were moments of immense agitation among the student body and the alumni, who urged the government to take swift action against the perpetrators of the mayhem.
Speaking to The Express Tribune on the matter, Khan Zaman, the President of the Islamia College Senior Alumni Association, nostalgically recalled times which were much more peaceful and prosperous, and simultaneously urged the relevant stakeholders to play their part in reinstating order. “The government, administration, faculty and students, must collectively work towards restoring the prestige and repute of these historical institutions,” concluded Zaman.

1,"SCCI, UET to collaborate on research",MoU signed in a bid to further improve industry-academia linkages,"The Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) and the University of Engineering and Technology (UET) Peshawar have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) in a bid to further improve industry-academia linkages.
According to a statement issued here on Friday, a signing ceremony was held at the chamber’s house in which SCCI President Muhammad Ishaq and Director Office of Research, Innovation and Commercialisation (ORIC) UET Peshawar Dr Nasru Minallah inked the MoU.
Senior SCCI Advisory Committee member Dr Khalid Khan, Manager University Industry Linkage, UET Dr Tariq Khalil, Office Manager Dr Jawad Ali Shah and others were present.
Ishaq termed the signing of the MoU with UET a milestone step towards strengthening industry-academia linkages, saying the SCCI started a series of MoUs with public and private sector universities.
He elaborated that the MoU aimed at equipping graduates and young students with technical skills besides the completion of their academic pursuits so that it would enable them to get instant employment opportunities.
The SCCI president apprised the meeting that the chamber had recently inked a memorandum of corporation (MoC) with the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) Technical Education and Vocational Training Authority (Tevta) under German Organisation (GIZ) Tevta Support Programme.
Under the GIZ Tevta Support Programme, he said, the SCCI and Tevta would jointly conduct capacity building and job training sessions to bring improvement in youths/graduates skills and ensure their job placement in various trade organisations and industries.
Talking about the SCCI 2.0 programme, Ishaq informed that the chamber was going to launch this programme very shortly, which was the first-ever initiative taken by the SCCI in Pakistan under which the chamber would be developed on modern lines by equipping it with complete digitisation and bringing it up to modern standards.
The SCCI chief said there was a lack of entrepreneurship in the province, saying: “Our youth is highly skillful and capable to excel in every field.”
He, however, said there was a need to provide youth with a proper platform to utilise their abilities efficiently and continue playing a role in the country’s economic prosperity and progress.
On the current state of Pakistan’s economy, Ishaq said the industries and businesses were in severe crisis owing to multiple reasons and inconsistent policies.
The SCCI president informed that currently industries were working 10 to 20 per cent of their installed capacity under the prevailing circumstances.
Ishaq remarked immense natural and mineral reserves existed in K-P, in which gemstone, mining, and marble were at the top.
He added that the SCCI had taken initiatives for promotion of the gemstone sector. The SCCI chief called for tapping natural reserves and resources in an efficient manner to bring economic stability and improvement.
Earlier, ORIC UET Peshawar Director Minallah and Manager University Industry Linkage, UET Peshawar Khalil briefed the chamber president regarding various projects that were initiated by their department.

2,Dir’s Koto power plant nearing completion,Plant will help overcome electricity shortage in K-P,"The construction of the Koto Power Plant in Lower Dir district of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) has entered the final stages of completion.
After successful completion at the end of this year, the project will start producing 40.8 megawatts of cheap electricity, which will bring more than Rs2 billion to the provincial exchequer annually and create new employment opportunities in the province.
It will help overcome the energy crisis too in the province.
This was stated by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Pakhtunkhwa Energy Development Organization (PEDO) Engr Naeem Khan during his surprise visit to the project site on Friday.
He was accompanied by Deputy Commissioner Lower Dir Iftikhar Khan Marwat. He reviewed progress of work on the dam and various parts of the project.
About the ongoing construction work, Deputy Director Engineer Muqeemuddin said that due to security reasons, several workers of the team of Chinese engineers working on the project had left their work and went back to their home country, while during the Covid-19 emergency, it proved very difficult to bring machinery for the project as there was a global lockdown.
Due to these reasons, the project work was slightly delayed but they were trying their level best to catch up.
“After the security situation improved, now the Chinese staff is back and work has been once again in progress with full pace and the required heavy machinery had also been brought to the site,” he maintained, adding that there were some difficulties in acquiring land for the project and it was another cause of delay, on which Deputy Commissioner Iftikhar Khan assured the project officials that discussions were in progress with the local people regarding the purchase of land and payments to the landowners would be made soon.
Eng Naeem Khan, while expressing satisfaction over the pace of work on the project, directed the field staff that the pace of work on the project should be increased so that the people can benefit from the project soon.
It is worth mentioning here that Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government has decided to restart construction work on the Lawi Hydropower Project in Chitral district that had been stopped due to some security and financial issues.
A financial package has also been announced and security issues have been resolved to ensure speedy work on the project.
Similarly, the World Bank (WB) will fund two hydropower projects of 245 megawatts in Swat this year, the completion of which will bring an annual income of more than Rs13 billion to the province.
The WB will lend money to the K-P government for this purpose.
In October last year, a meeting was held under the chairmanship of Secretary Energy and Power Nisar Ahmad Khan, with the project directors of WB regarding progress on both the projects.
The WB will fund the projects as part of the development energy sector including the 157 MW Madyan Hydropower Project and 88 MW Gabral Kalam Hydropower Project.
In this regard, a $450 million agreement has been signed between the WB and the provincial government.

4,Balochistan to distribute free rice seeds from April 15,Move comes after last year’s floods destroyed crops,"Balochistan Minister for Agriculture Mir Asadullah Baloch on Friday said that free of charge rice seeds would be distributed among farmers from April 15 in five districts of Naseerabad Division.
“The Balochistan Agriculture Department distributed free wheat seeds throughout the province last year. Now, the supply of free seeds for rice, the main crop of autumn, will be ensured,” the minister said while addressing a meeting on Friday. The meeting was attended by Agriculture Secretary Umaid Ali Khokhar and other officials.

The Balochistan Agriculture Department has launched a campaign for free supply of wheat seeds in September and October to provide relief to the farmers and to get them back on their feet after the devastating flash floods.
The minister said that despite severe financial difficulties, the provincial government made arrangements for the free supply of wheat seeds, the most important crop in the entire province for the revival of agriculture. 
“Committees have been formed in each district under the leadership of the deputy commissioners (DCs) to ensure the distribution of wheat seeds in a transparent manner,” he added.
He shared that with the support of Asian Development Bank (ADB), a plan has been devised for free supply of rice seeds in five districts of Naseerabad Division.
The survey has been completed and the rice seeds will be distributed free of cost from April 15, he added.
Agriculture Secretary Khokhar informed the participants that with the efforts of the Agriculture Minister Asadullah and the provincial government, all available resources were being utilised for the development of agriculture.
