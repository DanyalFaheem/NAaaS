0,Govt allows full range of imports,SBP removes condition of 100% advance payment on import of hundreds of items,"Pakistan has reopened imports of the full range of goods by removing restrictions imposed on the import of 826 items from time to time between 2017 and 2022.
The major items freed from import restrictions include raw material for cement and steel, vehicle parts, confectioneries, chocolate, mineral water, cigarette paper, electrical and electronic goods and some machinery and parts.
According to a circular of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the bank has removed the condition of depositing up to 100% payment in advance for the import of hundreds of items.
The central bank said in a circular on Friday “it has been decided to withdraw existing cash margin requirement/ CMR (advance payment) on import of items with effect from March 31, 2023.”
A couple of months ago, the SBP instructed commercial banks to prioritise import financing for different goods including energy (petroleum products and LNG), pharmaceuticals and medical equipment, raw material and machinery for exporters and vehicles (including passenger cars).
Talking to The Express Tribune, Pak-Kuwait Investment Company Head of Research Samiullah Tariq said the government had removed the restrictions as it was a condition of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the resumption of its $6.5 billion loan programme.
Arif Habib Limited Head of Research Tahir Abbas said now importers were no more required to deposit any amount in advance.
Linking the central bank’s decision with a pre-requisite condition of the IMF, he said it was one more step in the direction of reviving the IMF’s Extended Fund Facility (EFF).
He recalled that the central bank had softened the condition of 100% cash margin in August 2022 and allowed traders to import goods on only 25% advance payment in case they were due to make payment within 90 to 180 days. Those who were to make import payment after 180 days were to submit zero margins, but those who were due to make import payment in less than 90 days were liable to pay 100% advance payment.
“But now all restrictions have been removed with regard to advance payment, according to the latest SBP circular.”
Ismail Iqbal Securities Head of Research Fahad Rauf said the removal of the condition of advance payment by importers “…will reduce the liquidity requirement of importers.”
Technically, the demand for US dollars should immediately go down in the inter-bank market. However, practically it may not be possible due to the limited foreign exchange reserves of $4.59 billion, which provided an import cover of just one month, he said.
On the contrary, the government has been able to push down the demand for import by almost half keeping in view the low foreign exchange resaves and mitigate the risk of default on foreign debt repayment.
Anyhow, the decision to remove restrictions on imports stands out positive for the country, experts said.
Earlier, the government imposed curbs on imports from time to time to slow down the outflow of foreign exchange.
Pakistan lifted the restrictions on imports after its current account deficit narrowed to a two-year low at $78 million in February 2023 in the wake of import control measures. However, the risk of default on foreign debt repayment continued to remain.
Pakistan completely opened imports after China, the second largest economy, provided $1.7 billion over the previous month and rolled over another $2 billion on Thursday.
Otherwise, other multilateral and bilateral creditors, who have made financial commitments worth around $9 billion in flood relief, are still awaiting the IMF’s nod before honouring their commitments.
On the positive side, there are 826 items from which restrictions have been removed.
Some items are in the confectionery category which include ice cream, butter, chocolate, cheese, fish, yogurt and natural honey.
Items in fruit and vegetable category include fresh dates, dry fruits, prickles, bulgur wheat, juices and mineral water.
Other items are smoking tobacco, non-alcoholic beer, perfumes, makeup articles like nail polish and lipstick.
Cigarette paper, raw material for steel (cold-rolled coil and hot-rolled coil), cement and clinker are also included.
Others are readymade garments, footwear, ceramics, electronic and electrical items, video games, wooden furniture, motorcycles, old used and reconditioned tyres, tubes and their raw material, bicycles, diapers, granite and other stones, SIM cards, other live animals, other rice in husk (paddy), other grain sorghum (jawar), microwave ovens, LCDs and colour television sets.

1,"Pakistan, China scientists to combat citrus diseases","Explore green solutions to enhance quality, quantity of citrus fruit","Chinese and Pakistani scientists are collaborating to develop biological control measures to enhance the quality and quantity of citrus fruit in Pakistan.
A research centre was launched by the two countries in 2018 to jointly explore green and sustainable solutions to the growing prevalence of citrus diseases across the South Asian nation.
Speaking to the China Economic Net, Professor Dr Qiu Baoli and Professor Dr Shaukat Ali, Director and Deputy Director of the China-Pakistan citrus pest management centre, said that while chemical measures could provide quick responses to citrus disease outbreaks, they also increased the resistance of pests against pesticides, posing grave environmental and health threats.
The researchers told CEN that the centre, initiated by South China Agricultural University and Sargodha University, had undertaken four strands of research work to produce environmentally friendly solutions.
The first line of research, Qiu and Ali noted, focused on the use of “lure and kill” technology to dispel pests. For example, researchers have investigated how different types of traps and lures will affect the efficacy of capturing pests in citrus orchards across six citrus-producing Pakistani cities.
Qiu said that the researchers had also been developing technologies to breed parasitic wasps and predatory insects, which were natural enemies of citrus pests.

2,Deutsche Bank shares plunge 14.9%,Germany’s largest bank sees $3b wiped off market value in just a week,"Deutsche Bank shares tumbled on Friday after the cost of insuring the bank’s debt against the risk of default shot to more than four-year highs, highlighting concerns among investors about the stability of Europe’s banks.
The region’s banking sector has had a rough ride in the last week, with a state-backed rescue of Credit Suisse and turmoil among regional US banks fuelling concerns about the health of the global banking sector.
Deutsche shares, which have lost more than a fifth of their value so far this month, fell by as much as 14.9% on Friday to their lowest in five months. The shares were last down 13% at 8.13 euros ($9.16).
Germany’s largest bank has seen $3 billion wiped off its market value in the space of just week.
Deutsche Bank’s credit default swaps (CDS), a form of insurance for bondholders, shot up above 220 basis points (bps) – the most since late 2018, from 142 bps just two days ago, based on data from S&P Market Intelligence.
On Thursday, Deutsche CDS had their largest one-day gain on record, based on Refinitiv data. But they remain well below highs of close to 300 bps logged during the euro zone debt crisis in 2011.
CDS for major European banks rose across the board on Friday, reflecting investors’ reluctance to carry any risk on their portfolios going into the weekend.
“Deutsche Bank has been in the spotlight for a while now, in a similar way to how Credit Suisse had been,” Stuart Cole, Head Macro Economist at Equiti Capital, said.
“It has gone through various restructurings and changes of leadership in attempts to get it back on a solid footing but so far none of these efforts appear to have really worked.”

3,Steps being taken to enhance exports: Iqbal,Minister reiterates commitment to implementing CPEC project,"Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Ahsan Iqbal on Friday reiterated the government’s firm commitment to the development of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and ensuring its successful implementation.
“We are taking all necessary steps to address the pressing issues and enhance the country’s exports, and we are grateful to China for its continued support in this regard,” the minister said while chairing a meeting to review progress on CPEC-related projects.
The meeting, according to a press statement, also discussed progress on Special Economic Zones (SEZs), ML-1, Karachi Circular Railway and various new development initiatives that would be discussed in the upcoming sittings of Joint Working Groups (JWG).
During the meeting, the planning minister underlined the importance of strengthening the country’s export sector, directing the quarters concerned to follow up on the prime minister’s proposal of seeking the help of Chinese professionals for the development of Pakistan’s export sector.
Iqbal said the top priority of the government’s 5Es agenda was to enhance exports and to ensure that Pakistan could benefit from China’s expertise.
He instructed officials to make SEZs a medium of enhancing exports, adding that the zones could foster collaboration and innovation, which could lead to the development of new products and services that were better suited to the demand of international markets.
The meeting also discussed proposals for the upcoming sittings of JWGs including the advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), solar projects and study on pumped storage hydropower projects.

4,MoU inked to empower flaxseed research,Flax a promising crop that can produce edible oil to meet Pakistan’s needs,"Recently, the Gansu Academy of Agricultural Sciences (GAAS) and Sindh Agricultural University (SAU) signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for the China-Pakistan flax research and innovation hub.
“Our new flax varieties, the Longya series, are all selected according to the dry climatic conditions with little rainfall in Northwest China. In the planting experiments, the yield is generally more than 10% higher than that of the local varieties, and the resistance to diseases and insect pests is stronger,” Zhao Wei, Researcher at the Crop Research Institute of GAAS, said in an interview with the China Economic Net (CEN).
Longya No 11, 14 and 15 have been planted in Pakistan preliminarily. The Longya series should be able to exert a good effect of drought resistance and increase yield under the climatic conditions of Pakistan, he stressed.
“It is a variety most Pakistani farmers are not familiar with but it can produce edible oil much needed in the country,” Project Leader Dr Abdul Ghaffar Shar, a doctoral candidate of Northwest A&F University who has been studying in China for nine years, told the CEN, adding that experiment had started at SAU, Tandojam.
“Flaxseed contains 35-44% oil. The seed oil, rich in unsaturated fatty acids mainly linolenic acid, serves as a nutritional supplement, in addition to its huge role in coatings, textiles and animal husbandry. Flax is a promising economic crop.”
According to Shar, the average production of flaxseed in Pakistan is as low as 692 kg per hectare because of less soil fertility, blind use of fertilisers, lack of high-yielding hybrid varieties and old cultivation practices.
Looking into the importance of edible oil and low yield of oil crops, it is vital to focus on short- and long-term studies on the imported hybrid flaxseed varieties suitable for cultivation under the soil and climatic conditions of Pakistan.
“Our experiment will be conducted in the greenhouse of the Department of Soil Science, SAU Tandojam to evaluate Chinese flaxseed hybrids for better growth, grain, and oil yield under different fertiliser doses,” Shar added.
Zhao emphasised that the current planting area of the Longya series accounts for about one-third of the flax area in China, and about 3.3 million hectares have been planted in the main flax producing areas of the country, with an increase of more than 300 million kg of flaxseeds and an increase of more than 1.5 billion yuan in output value. Up to now, Shar has proposed the saline-alkali land improvement technology of applying desulphurised gypsum, as well as the technology of precise application of organic fertiliser, which have obvious effects on local soil improvement
“In addition to the flax cultivation, our value-added products, such as a-linolenic acid capsules, eye care solution, as well as technical achievements such as flax seeds used as livestock feed to increase the content of a-linolenic acid in milk and meat, can be shared with Pakistani counterparts.”

5,Forex reserves increase to $4.59 billion,SBP attributes rise to $500m commercial loan disbursement,"The foreign exchange reserves held by the central bank rose by 6.4% on a week-on-week basis to $4.3 billion, according to data released by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Friday.
On March 17, 2023, the SBP’s foreign currency reserves stood at $4,598.7 million, up by $280 million compared to $4,319.1 million on March 10.
The central bank attributed the rise in foreign exchange reserves to the receipt of $500 million as government of Pakistan’s commercial loan disbursement.
“After accounting for external debt repayments, SBP reserves increased by $280 million to $4,598.7 million,” it said in a statement.
Overall, the liquid foreign currency reserves held by the country, including the net reserves held by banks other than the SBP, stood at $10,139.2 million. The net reserves held by banks amounted to $5,540.5 million.
Ismail Iqbal Securities Head of Research Fahad Rauf recently said that any significant improvement in Pakistan’s foreign currency reserves depended on the revival of IMF loan programme and the inflow of fresh financing from other multilateral and bilateral creditors. 
“They (FX reserves) are projected to rise to around $7-8 billion by the end of current fiscal year,” he said.

6,OGRA accused of flouting price mechanism,OMCs seek recovery of exchange rate losses on petroleum imports,"The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) and oil marketing companies (OMCs) are locked in a tug of war over the recovery of exchange rate losses on imports, which have put the latter on the verge of collapse.
Last month, OMCs had conveyed to the government that they had incurred losses of Rs32 billion in just one fortnight of February owing to sudden depreciation of Pakistani rupee against the US dollar.
According to sources, the issue was taken up in a meeting held by the regulator on Friday.
During the huddle, it was highlighted that the regulator was violating the oil pricing mechanism covering the exchange rate losses, which was approved by the federal government.
OMCs argued that Ogra was bound to settle the exchange rate losses within a month’s time in line with the oil pricing formula.
In recent months, the regulator had been settling the exchange rate losses after 90 days instead of 30 days. This has pushed the OMCs on the verge of collapse, according to sources.
Ogra was reluctant to follow the approved pricing mechanism. It insisted that the OMCs should retire Letters of Credit (LCs) for oil imports after selling petroleum products in market without settling the exchange rate losses.
OMCs, other than PSO, had also requested for allowing them not to follow the date of LCs opened by PSO. At present, oil prices are linked with the cost of imports made by PSO.
Meanwhile, Ogra in a statement said “it is committed to protecting consumer interest as well as providing a level playing environment for its stakeholders.”
Ogra convened a meeting on the request of OMCs to discuss the exchange rate adjustment mechanism. It was attended by industry representatives including the Oil Companies Advisory Council (OCAC), Oil Marketing Association of Pakistan (OMAP) as well as officials of the Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division) and Ogra.
Ogra’s finance department explained the exchange rate adjustment mechanism in depth so that the stakeholders may understand the process.
It was noted with deep concern that a counterproductive media campaign was being run against Ogra, which was rebutted. “Ogra is cognizant of its mandate and is fully committed to working in public interest,” the regulator emphasised.
Last month, oil companies claimed that they had suffered a huge loss of Rs35.88 billion in the wake of artificial control of the government over petroleum product prices.
Of the total loss, the currency exchange loss was calculated at around Rs32.6 billion for the second fortnight of February 2023.
Separately, the oil industry said that it was incurring a loss of Rs2.9 billion on account of customs duty and Rs305 million due to low margins. Industry players say the government is violating its approved oil pricing formula and artificial price adjustments are being made on verbal orders.
According to them, duties on high-speed diesel (HSD) and petrol imports have been reduced following verbal instructions of Ogra.
OCAC Chairman Waqar Siddiqui, in a letter to Minister of State for Petroleum Musadik Malik last month, warned that the government had been making artificial adjustment in oil prices without following the approved formula.
He pointed out that the practice had continued since last year during which the oil industry suffered a loss of Rs35 billion. “The oil industry will not be in a position to meet oil demand if such artificial price adjustment continues.”
Turning to industry margins, the OCAC chairman pointed to a long pending revision in margins of OMCs on motor fuels, which was approved by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) on October 31, 2022.
The revised margin of Rs6 per litre has not been fully incorporated into the HSD price to date.
The industry is enduring a severe financial crunch due to high global prices, depreciation of the rupee, increased LC confirmation charges, challenges in establishing and retiring LCs, high markup rates, high premiums on import, etc.

7,CDWP okays six projects of Rs21b,"Schemes are related to Ministry of Climate Change, aviation and provinces","The Central Development Working Party (CDWP) on Friday approved six development projects worth Rs21.28 billion in a meeting chaired by Federal Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Ahsan Iqbal.
The forum considered four projects related to the Ministry of Climate Change, Aviation Division and provincial schemes.
It approved the installation of a weather surveillance radar in Multan at a cost of Rs6,188.759 million, establishment of a 250-bed hospital in Skardu at a cost of Rs6,045 million, establishment of excellence hubs for renewable energy at a cost of Rs111.403 million, construction of a road from Naag to Gichak at a cost of Rs4,255.591 million, construction of two lanes for DI Khan (DI Khan development package) at a cost of Rs3,097.045 million and capacity building and institutional strengthening of Planning Commission at a cost of Rs2,086.299 million.
The Ministry of Finance, Revenue and Economic Affairs is the sponsoring agency of the project for installation of weather surveillance radar in Multan.
In another project, the 250-bed hospital in Skardu will be constructed on land measuring 500 kanals. After completion of the project, patients of all four districts of Baltistan region, tourists and army authorities will benefit and it will save a significant amount of public money being spent on travel for treatment of patients in far-off health facilities.
The hospital will provide state-of-the-art tertiary healthcare facilities at the doorsteps of patients. Currently, there is a 190-bed Regional Headquarter hospital in the Baltistan Division.
For the establishment of excellence hubs of renewable energy costing Rs111.403 million, the provincial government of Punjab is the sponsoring agency.
The project is aimed at introducing two excellence hubs of renewable energy for exploring new avenues keeping in view the demand and supply issues in the energy sector.
The primary function of an excellence hub is the availability of trained manpower in the market by imparting technical training along with the promotion of renewable energies, which includes the counselling of companies, testing of equipment and machinery, start-up support and information sharing.
CDWP also approved the construction of a road from Naag to Gichak at a cost of Rs4,255.591 million. The provincial government of Sindh is the sponsoring agency of the project.
It envisages construction of a 47.557km-long and two-lane-wide single-lane carriageway from Naag to Gichak, having width of six metres (three-metre-wide each lane) with 1.5-metre-wide shoulders on each side, in district Panjgur and Washuk in the southern region of Balochistan.
The proposed road will connect Gichak with the main stream of National Highway (N-85) as well as with Panjgur towards West and with Awaran city to the South.
Its connection with Awaran will provide an alternative route to Bela and then onwards to Karachi, the economic hub of Pakistan, through the National Highway (N-25).
Its scope of work includes earthwork, sub-base and base, pavement structures, construction of bridges and culverts, drainage and ancillary works, retaining/ breast walls, along with allied structure.
The meeting was attended by the secretary planning ministry, chief economist, members of the Planning Commission and representatives of various ministries and divisions.
