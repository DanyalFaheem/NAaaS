2,Teen gamers killed by train,"As the train zoomed ahead, it hurled the victims to their death","A passenger train had been chugging down the track en route to Karachi on Thursday night in what appeared to be a normal journey, and then an incident happened that one falls short of words to explain. 
The train hit two teenagers who had been sitting on the track at the Pathanwala Railway Gate in Quaidabad Colony of Lodhran, playing a game on their mobile phone sets.
The teenagers, who had been reportedly playing PUBG, were so engrossed in their activity that they didn’t see the train coming. 
It defies logic that the teenagers missed seeing the train. Besides, one wonders why did they choose the track to sit on it to play their favourite game?
Call it a folly or misfortune, Daniyal, 18, and his buddy, Rustam, 19, died as the train ran its course finding the teenagers in its path. 
One could only conjecture what could have happened, and the likely scenario that emerges suggests that the teenagers must have been sitting on the track across from each other and as the train zoomed ahead, it hurled the teenagers to either ends of the track. 
Arshad, a grief-stricken uncle of one of the teenagers, while talking to The Express Tribune, said that the friends had been addicted to PUBG, and they never missed a day without playing it.
He said that the other day they played the game while sitting in a rickshaw, but on the ill-fated day they decided to play it while sitting on the rail track.
Arshad said that it was not an unusual thing for the people of the area to sit on the track in the evening and enjoy the breeze especially when the weather was too hot to sit at home.
He said that there was a pair of tracks in their area and people sat carelessly on one of the tracks anticipating a train would be chugging down the other track.
Arshad said that the tracks were sort of a play area for the folks who mocked movie scenes in which a hero was shown crossing a rail track beating an oncoming train by mere seconds.
He said that his nephew had merely had his Iftar with his mother and went out telling her mother that he would spend the night out with his friend and would go to work at daybreak.
Arshad ruled out any foul play, saying that they didn’t have any enmity with anyone, and they were a happy family living with each other harmoniously.
Daniyal and Rustam also had a friend Amir who frequently joined them to play the game.
On the ill-fated day, the two friends went to Amir’s house to take him along. Amir told them that he would join them later.
When Amir didn’t turn up, Daniyal and Rustam telephoned him.
Amir told his friends that he didn’t feel like coming to the track to play the game. Instead, he asked his friends to come to his place where he had arranged two charpoys outside the house, and they could lounge on the charpoys and play the game.
Daniyal and Rustam refused their friend’s offer and continued with their game while sitting on the track.
“If only they had accepted Amir’s offer, things would have been different,” said Arshad with tears flowing down his cheeks.

3,"New SOPs in place to designate Ghazis, martyrs",Six-member committee in each district will determine which officer receives the distinction,"Punjab Police have issued new Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to designate police officers as Ghazis or martyrs.
Punjab Inspector General of Police (IGP) Dr Usman Anwar defined a ""Ghazi"" as any police officer or official who is injured in an explosion, firing, a clash with criminals or any other operation. Traffic wardens injured on duty will also be treated a ""Ghazi"" by Punjab Police.
A six member committee headed by district police officers (DPO) will conduct a monthly meeting to nominate Ghazis. The list prepared by the district committees will be forwarded to the regional committee, which will itself consist of six members including CCPO Lahore and RPOs. 
The regional committee will also consider the cases of officials from the Special Branch, CTD, PHP, Elite Force and Traffic Police will also be considered by the regional committee. The committee’s provisional head will be additional IG welfare and finance. 
The nominations of Ghazis will be reviewed every three months and they will be awarded an honorary certificate and an insignia to place on their uniform. A gazetted rank officer will be appointed a focal person. 
Meanwhile, the Punjab Police has followed a generous policy for their martyrs, known as the Shaheed Package. Separate packages are available for the families of officers martyred by terrorists, criminals or killed in road accidents. 
The package for officers martyred by terrorists includes the payment of a lumpsum amount of Rs10 million, Rs13.5 million for a house, a seven marla plot and a maintenance and transport allowance of Rs20,000 rupees. 
The Shaheed package for a constable or head constable martyred by criminals includes a lumpsum amount payment of Rs4 million and Rs13.5 million for a house. 
Similarly, the Shaheed package for a constable or head constable suffering accidental death or dying in a traffic accident while on duty included a lumpsum amount payment of Rs3 million and maintenance and transport allowance of Rs15,000.
Additionally, the family will receive full pay and allowances, as well as free education for the children of the martyred officers.

4,Complaints dismissed as ‘fallacious’,Fact-finding body ‘investigates matter thoroughly’,"The matter of issuing fake e-challans as well as unofficial challans across Punjab has come to the notice of the traffic police highups. 
A circular was issued to all the chief traffic officers, District Police Officers and District Traffic Officers by the SSP of Headquarters, Rafat Haider Bukhari, which said that the matter of issuing of fake traffic e-challans had come to light across Punjab. Questions were also being raised why field officers issued manual challans instead of automatic digital challans. 
Following the issuance of the circular, the Chief Traffic Officer of Lahore, Mustansar Feroze, formed a fact-finding committee. The team completed all its investigations in light of the circular.
Mustansar Feroze explained to The Express Tribune how the digital challaning system worked. He said that the e-challans were issued by the Punjab Safe City Authority which detected traffic rule violations with the help of the cameras. He said that challans were sent directly to the vehicle owners who violated the traffic rules. 
Mustansar Feroze said that vehicle owners could also check the challan by registering their vehicle’s number with the Punjab Safe City Authority website. The challan amount was deposited by the vehicle owner themselves at a bank branch, and the complaints of e-challan being fake were untrue.
Chief Traffic Officer Mustansar Feroze said about digital challaning that traffic police used the challan book rarely. A spokesman for the Traffic Police, Rana Arif, said that police had caught some rogue drivers who allegedly used fraudulent means to avoid paying the challan money. Rana Arif said that 17 cases of fraud against such drivers had been registered so far this month.
Traffic police also received some complaints alleging that the traffic wardens entered the PS ID Code on unofficial paper. When an enquiry was conducted in this matter, it emerged that messages from 8070 could not be sent to those drivers who did not have a mobile phone or an internet service. 
However, the PS ID Code was generated when challan was issued. In such a case, the warden wrote the code on a plain paper to those drivers so that the amount of the challan could be paid through an online cash payment service.

5,Inclement weather ruins grain crops,Oilseed crops are adversely affected by rainy spells,"Recent rain, hailstorms and strong winds in many parts of Punjab added to the miseries of growers, who were not only concerned about standing wheat and maize crops but say that damages would also impact future Kharif crops, as they have lost investment capacity.
Weather experts on Friday said strong winds and rain had already flattened the wheat crops in different areas of the province and they warned that the current patterns of rain and wind could continue for the next 24 hours. 
Zafar Awais, a farmer from central Punjab, said that maize and canola crops may suffer the most after wheat. The only area where the current spell would benefit wheat is barani, or rain-fed wheat, where the crop was facing a long dry spell. However, it was harmful for oil seed crops like canola and mustard, which were being harvested. Grams crop sown on the plains just below the area may also suffer, he added.
Agriculture experts said that country now has to develop wheat genetics, with a focus on developing seeds that produce stronger straw and grain and could withstand the current patterns of rain and wind, they added. The experts further said that crop agronomy also needed to be improved, as old practices may not yield desired results.

7,Free flour scheme fraught with problems,It has only been five days since the programme was launched,"Various free flour distribution points set up in city were rendered inactive due to poor strategy on the part of the district administration and food department. Friday’s distribution process could not be resumed at several flour distribution points. 
Additionally, flour was reportedly being embezzled in connivance with flour mill owners and staff by issuing fake slips. Only five days passed since the start of the flour distribution campaign and during that period, incidents of women and elderly citizens getting injured and fainting were also reported. Citizens additionally accused administrative staff of misbehaving with citizens and making them queue for hours despite being eligible.
Despite heavy rains forecast by the meteorological department, district administration and food department officials, including Deputy Commissioner Umer Jahangir, could not move the free flour distribution points to a suitable location. Friday’s rain disrupted flour distribution at points established in the open. The distribution was called off for the day, while citizens returned home greatly disappointed after having to wait for several hours.
On the other hand, it was reported that hundreds of bags of flour are being embezzled on a daily basis by issuing fake slips and bags of flour are being sold at exorbitant prices in the market. Due to the lack of effective checking by district administration and alleged involvement of staff, dozens of people are being deprived of free flour every day. 
The citizens demanded that the higher authorities, including the caretaker Chief Minister, Commissioner Multan and Additional Chief Secretary South Punjab take notice and strictly monitor the distribution process.
