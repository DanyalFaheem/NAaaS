0,"In a first, caretaker minister chairs cabinet meeting",Azam Khan couldn’t attend due to family tragedy,"In an unprecedented move, the governor of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) nominated Caretaker Minister for Establishment and Administration and Inter-Provincial Affairs Syed Masood Shah to preside over the cabinet meeting, which Caretaker Chief Minister Muhammad Azam Khan could not attend due to a family tragedy.
The third meeting of the caretaker cabinet in K-P was scheduled for Monday, but unfortunately, it coincided with a personal tragedy for Caretaker CM Khan as his nephew passed away.
The importance of the cabinet meeting cannot be overstated, as it serves as the central forum for government affairs. Approval is necessary for any matter to proceed, and the absence of the chief minister, who is traditionally responsible for chairing the meeting, would have resulted in postponement in most cases.
However, the governor's decision to nominate Shah marks a departure from the usual practice and demonstrates the significance of maintaining continuity and efficiency in government affairs, especially during times of crisis.

1,ANP gives Wali Khan credit for 1973 Constitution,Asfandyar Wali said democratic values would be weakened when the Constitution and parliament were not kept supreme,"Awami National Party (ANP) President Asfandyar Wali Khan here Monday said that the progress and prosperity of Pakistan was linked with the strict implementation of the 1973 constitution.
In a message on golden jubilee celebrations of the 1973 constitution here, the ANP President said that the great leader of the Awami National Party Abdul Wali Khan as opposition leader had played a key role in giving the country a unanimous constitution and his efforts in this regard would be written in golden words in the history of Pakistan.
He said that the era in which the 1973 Constitution was drafted and approved, it was a difficult period for the country and the unanimous constitution was achieved due to the positive role played by the opposition leadership including Mir Ghous Bizenjo and Ameerzada Khan at that time.
Asfandyar Wali said that democratic values would be weakened when the Constitution and parliament were not kept supreme.

2,PHC denies Imran’s nephew bail relief,Says Hassan will have to appear in court for pre-arrest bail,"The Peshawar High Court (PHC) has disposed of a writ petition seeking pre-arrest bail for Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief Imran Khan’s nephew Hassan Khan Niaza, noting that the petitioner will have to appear in the court if he wants to get the relief.
A division bench of the PHC took up the writ petition, filed by Hassan’s father Hafeez Ullah Khan Niazi.
The petitioner had requested the court to grant pre-arrest bail to Hassan while also directing the authorities to provide him details about the first information reports (FIRs) registered against Imran’s nephew in various police stations across the country.
The counsel for Hafeez Ullah Khan Niazi as well as provincial Advocate General Amir Javed and Assistant Advocate General Barrister Yaseen Raza appeared before the court.
The petition said the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) led federal government was trying to harass Hassan by registering FIRs against him in different police stations.
It said Hassan was first arrested on March 20 by the Islamabad police when he was going to Islamabad's judicial complex in a fake case.
When a court ordered police to release him, Hassan was handed over to the Balochistan Police on the pretext that an FIR had also been registered against him in the province as well.
The petition said Hassan was later handed over to the Punjab Police, which had also registered a case against him. It said Hassan has been booked under section 302, 324, 188, 427, 290, 291, 147, 149, 353, 184 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
It said Hassan is being victimized as he is an active member of the PTI and has been participating in the PTI’s protests against the “illegal and unconstitutional” acts of the government.
The petition claimed that the government is also harassing Hassan and therefore he cannot appear in the court in person. The petitioner requested the court to grant his son a pre-arrest bail in all cases while also providing him the details of the various FIRs registered against Hassan.
It said Hassan will appear before a court in Nowshera on April 19 and requested the court to direct the provincial government not to arrest him.
The advocate general, however, said relatives of an accused person who is alive and who has already been given relief in other cases cannot seek bail on behalf of that person. Such an accused has to appear in court in order to get a bail, he said.
“Section 498 is very clear in this regard. If the accused is given a bail in absentia, other accused will also seek similar relief,” he added. The bench later disposed of the petition stating that Hassan Khan Niazi will have to appear in the court in order to get a pre-arrest bail.

To discuss the steps required to implement this plan, a meeting was held, chaired by the Caretaker Provincial Minister for Excise, Taxation and Narcotics Control Haji Manzoor Khan Afridi. The meeting was attended by high-ranking officials and heads of departments, who reviewed the challenges and difficulties being faced currently and offered suggestions and recommendations for their permanent solutions.
At the same time, the meeting directed the authorities to raise awareness among the young generation about the dangers of drugs and to organise symposiums and walks in educational institutions. This will help protect the youth from falling victim to this scourge, they suggested.
During the meeting, Afridi emphasised the importance of discouraging drug trafficking to free society from this menace forever. 
Additionally, he stressed the need to integrate the treatment and rehabilitation of addicts to prevent recovered addicts from relapsing.
Furthermore, the provincial minister highlighted the need to promote universal number plates on an emergency basis, facilitate the issuance of general number plates, and make vehicle registration automatic and transparent. He directed the immediate implementation of the action plan prepared in this regard, with necessary modifications.
Afridi also clarified that the excise department needs to achieve significant increases in its goals and achievements. This will not only increase public facilities but also significantly boost the province's revenue and help manage the economy, he added.

5,Juvenile prisoners lodged in cramped barracks,PHC CJ finds out squalid conditions during surprise jail visit,"Peshawar High Court (PHC) Chief Justice Musarrat Hilali on Monday paid an unannounced visit to the Central Jail in Peshawar to assess the living conditions of the inmates, where she identified several issues and instructed the authorities concerned to address them urgently.
Justice Hilali found that the juvenile prisoners were being housed in cramped and unsanitary barracks, which exposed them to various skin diseases and the risk of infectious outbreaks. Consequently, she ordered the superintendent of the jail to relocate the prisoners to a place where all necessary facilities are available.
Furthermore, Justice Hilali directed the judicial magistrate to expedite the hearing of minor cases. The prisoners in the overcrowded barracks also complained of inadequate food and other related facilities.
The chief justice expressed her displeasure at the mismanagement of the prison and called for special measures to be taken to address the issues identified during the visit. She emphasised the need to identify areas for improvement and implement a strict follow-up mechanism to ensure the provision of basic amenities to all prisoners as per the law.
In addition to inspecting the juvenile barracks, Justice Hilali also visited the women's barracks, where she found the conditions to be satisfactory.
