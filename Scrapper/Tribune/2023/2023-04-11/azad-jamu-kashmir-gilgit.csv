0,Court extends stay in Losar landfill site case,LHC’s Pindi bench angry at CDA chief for failing to submit response,"The Lahore High Court (LHC)’s Rawalpindi bench on Monday extended its stay orders until May 3 in a case pertaining to the allocation of 1,200-kanal land on Chak Belli Road at Losar in the suburb of Rawalpindi to the Capital Development Authority (CDA) for dumping capital’s waste.
At the previous hearing of the case, the court had barred CDA from acquiring the landfill site. The court directives were issued on petitions challenging the Rawalpindi administration’s notification, allowing the CDA to acquire the land and dump the capital’s waste at Losar.
Earlier, the CDA had to postpone the public hearing seeking objections regarding the dumping of the capital’s waste at Losar after the Punjab Environment Protection Department objected to the hurriedly called public debate.
During Monday’s hearing, Justice Mirza Waqas Rauf expressed immense indignation at the CDA chairman for failing to submit a response and granted him the final opportunity to submit the response at the next hearing.
The court also ordered the Rawalpindi commissioner and deputy commissioner to refrain from acquiring the landfill site for CDA at Losar, Rawalpindi until the final adjudication of the case.
The court remarked: “This is a basic human rights issue. After receiving replies from all the parties, the respective counsels will be heard on merits and then an appropriate decision will be made according to the law.”
At the onset of the hearing, the Punjab Environment Protection Department submitted its response, adopting the stance that there was no negative impact of the garbage dumping site in Rawalpindi. “There is no bad smell either. The groundwater is also clean and no disease has spread. There will be no harm in making it a dumping site for Islamabad,” it argued.
On the other hand, Advocate Omar Hayat Gondal, attorney for the petitioner, and resident Haji Iqbal contend that cancer, TB, ear, nose, throat, and stomach diseases have spread due to the presence of the Pindi’s landfill site.

1,Work on Chahan Dam expedited,Punjab government approves Rs650 million for land acquisition,"The Punjab government has expedited the process of land acquisition to further speed up work on the Chahar Dam project with the help of the Asian Development Bank.
The Punjab government has provided Rs650 million for land acquisition, while the project cost 117 million US dollars will be provided by the Asian Development Bank.
Work on the project has been started under a fast-track policy and work on the project will be started by the end of the current year.
With the approval of a grant of 117 million dollars from the International Development Bank, 12 million gallons of water per day will be available from Chahan Dam, which will be supplied to six densely populated union councils — Lakhan, Girja-1, Girja-2, Chak Jalaldin, Mohri Ghazan and Dhamyal.
Under the revised project, a new line will be laid for the supply of an additional five million gallons of water per day from the Rawal Dam Treatment Plant to Rawalpindi. After which the daily supply of water from Rawal Dam to Rawalpindi city will increase to 28 million gallons and WASA will no longer need to operate its 80 to 90 tube wells. This will help save electricity cost.
In order to provide a round-the-clock water supply to the Khayaban-e-Sir Syed area a water loop will be constructed and water coming from the Rawal Dam and tube wells will be diverted to these areas.
According to WASA sources, the Punjab government has issued a formal guideline to start work on Chahan Dam without delay.
Instructions have also been issued to the finance department to start the land acquisition process soon.
The Punjab government approved the project worth Rs5.3 billion to bring six MGD water from Chahan Dam in Dec 2018. The dam near Chakri is being constructed on River Sill Kus. It is located 22 kilometres from the garrison city.
The design of the dam has been altered to ensure a full-pressure water supply to the targeted areas. Under the new design, the route of distribution lines has been changed to supply water at full pressure and prevent water theft.
Under the new design, the site of the pumping station has been changed and brought closer to the dam while the route of water pipelines from the pumping station and filtration plants has also been altered to prevent water theft along the way. Under the new design, water supply lines will pass along the main road so that water theft could be identified.
 The pipelines will supply water from underground and overhead tanks to union councils Lakhan, Girja-I, Girja-II, Chak Jalaluddin, Mohri Ghazni and Dhamyal.

4,Patients suffer as DHQ hospital’s CT scan machine malfunctions,Sources say critical cases being referred to BBH and HFH,"Patients arriving in the garrison city’s largest trauma centre are facing immense difficulties as the computed tomography (CT) scan machine of the hospital has been out of order for the past 12 days.
According to sources, the patients arriving at the District Head Quarters (DHQ) hospital with serious injuries are being referred to other hospitals, including Holy Family Hospital (HFH) and Benazir Bhutto General Hospital (BBH), for imaging purposes.
Sources said the CT scan machines installed in both of these hospitals are already overburdened due to the increasing number of patients arriving there for medical treatment. They added that due to this the treatment process for the patients was getting delayed, leaving them in a difficult situation.
“Due to this, the CT scans of the critically ill patients being brought from the DHQ hospital are getting delayed and as a result, they are facing a painful situation.”
When contacted, DHQ hospital Medical Superintendent Dr Farzana Zafar stated: “The CT scan machine had developed a technical fault regarding its functionality which was removed but the fault has occurred again, therefore, new spare parts are being procured from Lahore”.

5,Unusual spike in street crimes irks citizens,Data reveals 827 incidents in first 20 days of Ramazan,"During the first 20 days of Ramazan, citizens were deprived of cars, motorcycles, mobile phones and rickshaws worth millions of rupees in an extraordinarily large number of incidents of street crimes in the garrison city.
According to the street crimes data obtained by The Express Tribune, 827 incidents of street crimes have been reported so far in the holy month.
Street criminals snatched or stole valuable vehicles from 78 citizens while police remained unsuccessful in recovering even a single stolen vehicle in 20 days.
According to the data, 454 motorcycles were stolen or snatched during the same period. The minimum value of the stolen motorcycles is more than Rs13.6 million.
In the first 20 days of Ramazan, 345 citizens were robbed of their mobile phones at gunpoint while 10 rickshaws were stolen from different areas.
According to the crime statistics, a total of 82 incidents of street crimes are being reported in Rawalpindi every day. Most incidents of street crimes were reported in New Town, Sadiqabad, Pirwadhai, Bani and Waris Khan police stations of Rawal Division.
On the other hand, Potohar Division’s Cantt, Westridge, Airport, Morgah, Taxila, Naseerabad and Civil Lines police stations failed to protect citizens against street crimes.
In Rawalpindi Saddar Division, citizens faced street crime incidents in the jurisdictions of Saddar Baruni, Dhamiyal, Chakri, Rawat and Gujar Khan police stations.
Sources said Rawalpindi Police busted 12 highly active gangs and main suspects involved in street crime incidents in the first 20 days of Ramazan while efforts were being made to get maximum punishment awarded to them.
They said the biggest obstacle in getting the suspects sentenced is citizens avoiding the process of identifying the accused. “If the citizens cooperate with the police investigation, the suspects may be punished,” they added.
Police officials say that every effort is made to protect the life and property of the citizens, but the lack of resources and manpower is a big problem.
Last year, the crime data obtained from police sources had also shown a huge increase in street crime incidents in the garrison city while the year 2022 proved to be as difficult for the people of the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad as the preceding year as a significant increase in street crimes was witnessed in both cities despite tall claims of curbing the rate of crime by the police high-ups.
Rawalpindi recorded a 154% increase in street crimes last year. However, the police removed the top crime of mobile snatching from the crime data sheet to show its ‘improved efficiency’.
Similarly, more than 10,500 cases were registered in 2022 in which citizens lost goods and cash worth Rs4 billion in armed robbery, theft, street crime and other incidents.

6,Call for more leadership roles for women,Participants say women in health sector remain grossly underpaid,"Participants of a moot in the federal capital said women must break the invisible shackles and render services in various fields, especially in health, as the sector needed their participation the most.
They were speaking at a seminar titled “Women Leadership in Health”, organised by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute on World Health Day.
Former Surgeon General of Pakistan Army Lieutenant General (retd) Dr Nigar Johar Khan while addressing the participants said that women must free themselves of fears to break all barriers to work alongside men. She said the health sector needed the cooperation of all genders to perform smoothly.
Nigar Johar said women constitute two-third of the healthcare workforce yet female representation dwindles as ""we progress up the hierarchy"".
She urged for collective efforts and changing mindsets to break stereotypes and norms that hold back women. She stressed that empowered women must use their positions to empower other women. Parliamentary Secretary Dr Shazia Sobia Aslam Soomro emphasised the role of women legislators in increasing access of women to quality health services especially during disasters through female-centric policies and engaging with women at the grass-roots level.
SDPI Executive Director Dr Abid Suleri said that the SDGs' agenda of leaving no one behind was unattainable without a gendered analysis of policies. He further said that gender-blind policies fail to deliver to different segments of society particularly in climate disasters and reflect in PSDPs and macro-economic policies. He added women struggle to break the horizontal and vertical glass ceiling in Pakistan and despite having a female prime minister in the past, Pakistan had its first female Lieutenant General after 75 years of independence.
Women in Global Health Deputy Executive Director Dr Shabnam Sarfaraz said that women were clustered in lower status and low payment roles in the health sector. She highlighted that the global gender pay gap in health was -24%, making female professionals grossly underpaid.
She pointed out that female students take up 70% of medical college seats, outperforming male students, yet only 46% of them continue practicing after graduation while only 35% of female doctors opt for a post-graduate qualification.
She added that there was an alarming 21% exit rate among female doctors after marriage due to gender-insensitive career advancement practices. Dr Nabeela Ali, Country Representative, JSI Research and Training Institute, urged for abolishing unwritten gender norms hindering female healthcare professionals from excelling in their careers.
