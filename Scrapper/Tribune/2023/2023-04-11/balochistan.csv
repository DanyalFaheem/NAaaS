1,Food crisis feared as groundwater depletes,Phenomenon also damages ecological system that might result in vanishing of natural grass,"Amidst multiple economic challenges, the nation is also facing the enormous challenge of depleting surface and groundwater resource with per capita water availability level touching the stress levels.
Most challenging is the depleting groundwater level posing threat to soil's fertility, agriculture, food security and the ecological system as its depletion increases salt concentration in soil, leading to adverse effects on agriculture and human health. 
With the demand for water increasing by the day, there is a dire need for sagacious use of water as mounting pressure on our available resources would make the situation more crucial during the days ahead.
""In our country, the agriculture sector is pumping average 60% water for irrigation, depending on demand of various crops,"" said Professor Dr. Tanveer Ahmed, head of the Department of Soil and Environmental Sciences at the Muhammad Nawaz Sharif University of Agriculture in Multan. 
""Depleting groundwater is likely to create food insecurity in the coming years by affecting the soil's fertility. Concentration of salt is increasing due to continuous process of downing of the water-table,"" Dr. Ahmed warned. 
Salty soil affects production up to 70% and since there is already 45% salinity in some irrigation areas of the country, controlling this phenomenon had become imperative to avert its harmful effects, Dr. Ahmed said. 
""If we fail to cope with this challenge, the depleting phenomenon would continue to add to salinity level, also making drinkable water injurious to human health.""
About the groundwater table, he said that it varied at scattered places, ranging from 50 to 80 feet in different areas of South Punjab. Similarly, the depleting ground water was also damaging the ecological system that might result in vanishing of natural grass in the coming years. 
""With downing water table, it would become harder for the plant roots to get sufficient ground water naturally, and this phenomenon will lead to bad effects on the ecosystem.""
He pointed out different causes of groundwater depletion, like massive water seepage through muddy banks of canals and other water courses and water wastage in our daily use like vehicles washing, lack of drip irrigation, careless industrial usage of water and absence of a holistic rainwater harvesting mechanism in the country.
Similarly, he also drew attention towards insufficient water storages and reservoirs, saying that rainwater harvesting could be a valuable panacea to water scarcity issues. 
""If big dams cost much, we can avail the alterative of small dams and ponds, especially in the newly-built housing societies and settlements. 
According to a boring plumber, Muhammad Ayub, the water table went down about 15 feet during the last decade.

2,Inter-provincial sugar transport to require permit,Price in Lahore rises by Rs35 in a month to Rs125 per kg,"Amid an increase in the price of sugar, the Punjab government has formulated a mechanism to stop smuggling of the commodity. 
Under the policy, a permit from the district administration concerned will be mandatory for inter-provincial transportation of sugar.
The personnel deployed at checkpoints on the provincial borders will be instructed to prevent the smuggling of sugar. 
According to officials, a crackdown has been launched against hoarders and 50,000 sacks of sugar seized in the past three days.
The move comes after the price of sugar in the province increased by Rs15 per kg within a week and Rs35 in the past month.
The commodity is being sold at Rs120 to Rs125 per kg in the provincial capital, while the price in other areas of the province has exceeded Rs130. 
According to market sources, the main reason for the increase in the price is a hike increase demand during Ramazan and smuggling to Afghanistan. 
The Punjab government in collaboration with other provinces and local sugar mills is devising a mechanism to stop the smuggling. 
Punjab Food Secretary Muhammad Zaman Wattoo said while talking to The Express Tribune that a crackdown had been launched against hoarders. So far, more than 50,000 sacks of sugar have been seized. 
He said there had been reports of hoarding in various places in the province and teams had been formed to take action on the complaints.
He said seven cases had been registered against speculators and hoarders. 
The provincial secretary said the Punjab government was taking all possible measures to provide essential commodities to the people at affordable prices. 
He said most of the sugar seized from hoarders during the past three days by the Punjab Food Department had been found hidden sacks of flour in various mills.

4,City keeps expanding sans master plan,"LDA vows to protect farmland, develop green zones","The Master Plan 2050 for the provincial capital has not been finalised even after three years of work, apparently due to lack of interest from Lahore Development Authority (LDA) officers and poor coordination with provincial departments. 
According to urban development experts, the master plan envisaged by the authorities so far lacks a legal framework for crucial issues such as transportation, pollution control, health, education and conservation of agricultural land. They also expressed apprehension that the planning might be contrary to the ground realities of the city. 
However, LDA Director General Muhammad Ali Randhawa told The Express Tribune that the master plan had been prepared while keeping in view the current and future needs of the citizens. “All government departments, citizens, town planners and other sectors had been taken into confidence in preparing the master plan. The flaws that were identified in its preparation have been removed,” he added.
Randhawa said the agricultural area would be protected and green areas would be developed to curb pollution. He added that the LDA was informing the Lahore High Court about the situation.
Despite expenses of millions of rupees on its preparation, it is the third time that the master plan has failed to materialise since the previous plan’s tenure ended in 2020. 
The LDA started work on preparation of the Master Plan 2050 in 2018 and a foreign company was engaged against a payment of Rs510 million.
The second largest city of the country has been facing issues related to transport, pollution, municipal services, health, traffic and residential and commercial problems for many years due to unplanned urbanisation. 
The area of Lahore is 1,770 square kilometres and according to an estimate, its population has exceeded 20 million, which may reach 25 million by 2050. 
Most of the agricultural area of Lahore has been converted into residential schemes and construction has been completed on 872 square km. At the same rate of construction, the agricultural area of Lahore will be gone by 2050.
According to the experts, the Master Plan 2050 is necessary to meet the development needs of Lahore, Sheikhupura, Kasur and Nankana with better planning in the future. The plan should include facilities and municipal services for the residential, commercial and industrial zones, including transportation, health, education and parks. 
In the master plan prepared previously, the involvement of at least 26 provincial departments was shown in the documents, but without any meaningful input, a former official claimed. The most urgent issues faced by the metropolis are related to transport and employment.
A town planner said the initial plan had contained no major initiative in the transport sector except the Purple Line. The Sundar area was envisaged as an industrial zone, but there was no transport system planned to link it with localities across Lahore. 
Unchecked construction, felling of old trees for building highways, establishment of housing societies on agricultural land and heavy traffic have afflicted the city in recent years.
Private housing societies are being built on most of the city's agricultural land, which is a violation of the policies set to be included in the master plan. Currently, about 370 housing societies in Lahore are approved by the LDA, 140 are illegal and 60 are under process with the relevant departments. The cantonment board areas, DHA and cooperative housing societies are separate.
According to sources, the LDA has planned to convert existing sites in the city for residential and commercial use instead of building new housing societies in the new master plan. 
Former chief engineer Khushal Khan stressed the importance of reducing vehicular pollution and facilities for citizens to commute for employment. 
He also called for measures to check the pace of urbanisation.

7,"Buzdar skips ACE, court proceedings",Former CM gets 14-day extension in interim bail due to Covid,"Former chief minister Usman Buzdar skipped appearance before an Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) team investigating allegations of bribery in development work on Monday. 
He also sought exemption from appearance before an accountability court in a case of assets beyond means. 
According to the ACE, Buzdar's lawyer sought relaxation for a week because the leader had quarantined himself due to coronavirus. 
Buzdar is facing allegations of corruption in the construction of a 50km road from Bharathi to Khar Buzdar in Taunsa at a cost of Rs700 million with connivance of highway department officers and contractors. 
It was alleged that the road had fallen into disrepair because of the use of material of poor quality.
The former chief minister had approved schemes of millions of rupees for Bharathi, but material of poor quality had been used in tuff tiles. 
A multi-purpose hall was also allegedly constructed at the personal residence of Buzdar with government fund at the cost of millions of rupees. Another allegation pertains to corruption in a contract for the construction of the boundary wall of a cemetery. A relative of the former CM, Dr Ijaz Leghari, is also suspected of being involved in the scam.
Meanwhile, an accountability court granted an extension of 14 days in interim bail of Buzdar. His counsel had sought relief because the respondent was suffering from coronavirus. 
As he presented a Covid certificate, the court noted that it had been prepared by a hospital inaugurated by Buzdar. It also expressed annoyance over the absence of any senior counsel.
National Accountability Bureau officials said Buzdar had yet to satisfy them over queries regarding the case.

8,LHC seeks replies on transfers under caretaker setup,Court requested to restrain ECP from granting postings approval,"The Lahore High Court sought replies on Monday from authorities concerned regarding a plea filed by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) challenging the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) notification granting permission to the Punjab caretaker government to transfer officers without seeking prior approval.
The electoral watchdog had given unprecedented blanket permission to the Punjab government for transferring, posting and appointing provincial officers without requiring the ECP’s permission, which was mandatory under Section 230(1)(f) of the Elections Act 2017.
The petition requested that the court restrain the ECP from mechanically granting approval to unwarranted largescale requests of transfers and postings submitted by the caretaker government of Punjab, unless each case of transfer was examined by the ECP under the criteria laid down under the provisions of the Elections Act 2017.
The plea maintains that on January 12, 2022, the former Punjab chief advised the governor to dissolve the provincial assembly, and ultimately the Punjab assembly stood dissolved on January 14, 2023, whereafter the caretaker chief minister Punjab was appointed.
“The biased and controversial caretaker government in Punjab in order to materially affect the elections is not only taking major policy decisions but has also been issuing unwarranted large-scale blanket orders of transfers of officers of the provincial government, autonomous bodies, authorities, public companies and the local government without any expediency or valid justification violating the provisions of section 230 of the Election Act 2017 resulting in material affecting the forthcoming general elections by advancing the interests of the political interests of the petitioner’s political opponents, besides causing huge financial burden on the public exchequer as well,” the petition detailed.
It continued that the largescale transfers of the caretaker government were mechanically approved by the ECP without checking them with regard to the provisions of Section 230 of the Act. Whereas, in several cases, the transfer orders were issued “by the caretaker government without even bothering to obtain prior approval of the ECP”.
“The illegal exercise is going on, despite the fact that in several cases the high court has suspended such unwarranted transfer orders,” it contended.
According to the PTI lawyer, the respondents failed to redress the grievances of the petitioner.
The petition maintained that the “strong and reasonable apprehension of victimization at the hands of the aforementioned controversial officers, specifically expressed through the petitioner’s application to the ECP was proven correct”.
It furthered that the “controversial officers left no stone unturned to victimize the PTI, its leadership and workers in order to materially affect the election by causing every possible hindrance in the conduct of smooth election campaign of the petitioner, in order to give undue benefit to the PTI’s political opponents”.
In a separate case, the LHC reserved its decision on the maintainability of a petition seeking the removal of PTI chief Imran Khan as the party chairperson.
As proceedings commenced, the judge asked if the petitioner was the affected person to which his counsel argued that the petitioner is a voter and citizen of Pakistan.
When asked by the bench if this was the petitioner’s first plea, his counsel replied in affirmative. Muhammad Junaid had contended in his petition that the ECP had disqualified Imran Khan from NA-95, Mianwali in the Toshakhana case.
