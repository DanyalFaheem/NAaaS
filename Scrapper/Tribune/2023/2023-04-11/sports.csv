0,"DHA, CBC barred from charging extra for water",Police surgeon tells SHC toxic particles found in bodies of Keamari gas leak victims,"A two-member bench of the Sindh High Court headed by Justice Aqeel Ahmad Abbasi heard a petition related to non-supply of water to the residents of Defence Housing Authority (DHA) and Cantonment Board Clifton (CBC) and stopped the concerned authorities from charging extra money for water from the residents.
The counsel for the petitioner submitted that despite paying the tax, water is not supplied through the lines in the DHA and Cantonment Board areas. Water was being supplied by tanker and extra money is charged for it.
The court ordered to supply water in DHA, Clifton and Cantonment Board areas. The court remarked that five water tankers should be provided to the petitioner residents every month. 
Justice Abbasi also gave an earful to the representatives of the defendant, saying they make tall claims but have failed to provide water to those under their jurisdiction. When people pay taxes, it is the responsibility of DHA and the Cantonment Board to prove them water.
The court restrained the authorities concerned from collecting additional money from the residents and sought a detailed report from the parties on April 26. 
De-sealing 'toxic' factories
A two-member bench headed by Sindh High Court Chief Justice Ahmed Ali Shaikh heard the petition related to the deaths due to poisonous gas in Keamari and sought complete details from the deputy commissioner about factories in the area. 
At least 18 people died under mysterious circumstances in Keamari in January. The majority of the victims were women and children. 
Keamari Deputy Commissioner Mukhtiar Abro and other officers appeared before the court for the hearing in which the Sindh advocate general presented the report of the health department.
The court inquired how many factories were there in the area and what action had been taken against them. The advocate general responded that he would outline the areas where negligence took place. 
Meanwhile, the Sindh chief justice pointed out that the DC's report stated that the owners had voluntarily shut down their factories. He inquired why wasn't it stated that the factories had been sealed. Upon this, the DC responded that cases had been registered against four factory owners.
Justice Shaikh said there were inconsistencies between the statements of the assistant and deputy commissioners and expressed concern whether someone was taking instructions from factory owners.
The police surgeon told the court that post-mortem was performed on nine exhumed bodies and they showed presence of poisonous substances and plastic particles. The reports of the other five dead bodies would be available in eight to ten days.
The prosecutor general told the chief justice that following the post-mortem report, cases had been registered under the section for culpable homicide.
The court adjourned the hearing till May 15, seeking complete details from the Keamari DC regarding factories in the area.

2,"Girls abducted from Sindh married in Punjab, K-P: Raza","Minister for women development says police unwilling to register cases, pursue accused","Sindh Minister for Women Development Shehla Raza said on Monday that organised groups were involved in abducting young girls from Sindh and taking them to Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) to be married against their will. 
The minister said this while addressing a crowded press conference alongside the parents of two kidnapped girls.
Unlike Sindh, there are no laws against child marriage in Punjab and K-P, the minister said referring to minimum age laws against marriage. Sindh has tried to enforce 18 years as the age of marriage. In Punjab, the legal age is 16. However, in most of the country where the majority is conservative, girls are sometimes married as soon as they hit puberty. 
The case of a 15-year-old Karachi girl who was reported missing last year only to surface a few months later married in a town in Punjab brought renewed attention to child marriage laws in the country. Some claimed that the girl was abducted by a trafficking ring that coerced girls into staying in such forced relationship.
Raza made similar claims, saying the families were blackmailed, including from numbers registered in foreign countries. 
She claimed that a major trafficking ring was involved in luring girls, including online, with promises of love and then sell them off as property. 
She cited the case of the one of the missing girls whose parents were there. She said the abductors befriended the 12-year-old on a gaming application used on a cell phone. They enticed her with drugs and convinced her to steal jewelry and valuables from home. The girl went missing in January. 
Raza added that the family was receiving extortion calls, with the family even given in to the demands. ""However, the girl is yet to return.""
She said the laxity of laws in KP and Punjab meant teenage girls abducted from Sindh would be wedded in a ""staged marriage"". For this, all the preparations from the cleric who solemnizes the marriage to witnesses are already prepared in advance.
She also quoted the case of a 13-year-old who had a digital courtship with the person on the other end of the line asking to marry the underage teenager. Upon refusal, the person kept calling from different numbers. 
The girl went missing soon after and finally resurfaced in Lahore. In the meantime, the family was in constant contact with the man who had trapped the girl. 
Raza said that the family recently received a video in which the girl was ""tortured"". She said the girl, who was married to a Hafiz (memorizer) of the Holy Quran, was ""tortured"" on the pretext of excorcising a ghost.
She said the police in Punjab, KP and Sindh were exhibiting a lack of interest, adding that they were discouraging parents from registering cases. 
Raza added that she would meet the Sindh police chief in the next couple of days to find out the reason behind the inaction in such cases. She added that she was in communication with Punjab's interim chief minister, Mohsin Naqvi, as well.

3,Footfall on shoe shops not in step with Eid fever,"Price increase, affordable alternatives keep consumers at bay","The humdrum in markets and bazaars across the city continue to pick up as it gets closer to Eid ul Fitr, the annual celebration at the end of the holy month of Ramazan. It reaches fever pitch in the days leading to Eid but there is a clear surge in buys and footfall particularly during the second half.
It has been the case at the popular market for women's shoes and clothes in the past. But not this year as historic inflation cuts into purchasing power. Import curbs and increase in raw material prices have also had an impact, with an average of 40 per cent increase in prices compared to last year. 
Muhammad Hussam, who works at a popular shoe store in the area says its also because sellers are unable to provide discount deals and hard-pressed shoppers have an easier alternative in makeshift stalls that pop up during such festive periods and sell shoes and sandals at a discount.
He says women the love the colorful sandals with sophisticated designs that are available at their outlet. But this year, it hasn't translated into sales. 
There is one sale or another throughout the year, says Hussam, while an Eid-specific sale is also offered due to which shoes are available at a 30 per cent discount. 
However, last year they were selling two pairs of shoes for Rs1800 as part of a bundle offer. This year, there is no such sale and one pair is being sold for Rs1,150.
He said they didn't have a problem with supply with 70 per cent of their products manufactured at their own factory while the remaining 30 per cent is provided by their Lahore branch. 
The shoes range in style, from party to normal flats, bridal wear, heels, and stilettoes, but ""the most popular style at our store is sandals"", he added. ""Most women prefer simple sandals instead of more flashy and colorful shoes. Unique designs are available at reasonable prices through Eid offers,"" he added. 
A large number of markets offering a variety of shoes have been thriving in different parts of the city. The one in Hyderi is very popular, there are markets over Tariq Road in Saddar, at Jama Cloth Market, in Karimabad, and the Gulf Shopping Mall in Clifton among others. 
Mohammad Abdullah, who runs a popular shoe brand's branch in North Nazimabad, says women are mostly buying party wear sandals. They can range from anywhere between Rs1800 to Rs5000.

5,Govt accused of seizing wheat to meet procurement target,"'In a bid to meet procurement targets, officials are seizing wheat stocks of growers as smuggled, hoarded grain'","The farmers have blamed the provincial government for confiscating their wheat stocks kept for personal consumption and for seed for the next crop.
In the drive against hoarders and grain smugglers, the Sindh government officials, instead of conducting rids on the warehouses of big traders were picking of soft target - the grain stocks of small farmers, a representative body of growers said.
The Sindh Abadgar Ittehad (SAI), which lobbies for rights of the farmers, on Monday complained that the food authorities are raiding the storages of the growers instead of the traders who are involved in inter-district and inter-provincial smuggling of wheat. 
Moreover, the officials, in a bid to meet the procurement target, are seizing the wheat stocks of growers as 'smuggled' and 'hoarded' grain, said SAI President Nawab Zubair Talpur.
He said that this season the wheat growers have preferred to sell wheat in the open market instead of Sindh government due to better rates for the produce.
Traders are handed cheques at government procurement, whereas open market traders pay hard cash for the produce on the spot, Talpur said, adding, therefore farmers prefer to sell to the private sector. 
The Sindh government had set a target of procuring 1.4 million tons of wheat at the price of Rs4,000 per maund or 40kgs. However, the private sector buyers were paying Rs200 to Rs300 above the official procurement rates, he said.
According to him, the government is supposed to take action against traders who buy wheat from one district and sell it in another district or province against the law. Instead, in an apparent attempt to meet its target of procuring 1.4 million tons wheat, the government is confiscating legally owned and stored wheat from the agriculturists.

The resolution, moved by Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Member of Provincial Assembly (MPA) Ghanwer Ali Isran, stated that the recent controversy over the Supreme Court’s decision to take suo motu notice on the issue of elections in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). 
“The recently a controversy has arisen due to a decision regarding the holding of elections in Punjab and KP wherein four honorable judges have dismissed the suo motu while three honourable judges have issued directions to the Election Commission of Pakistan. It is a settled principle of law that decisions are taken by majority and minority cannot prevail over the view of the majority,” the resolution said adding that it is in the interest of the sanctity that the majority should prevail. 
Talking about the supremacy of the parliament, the resolution added that it was only the parliament which can amend the Constitution and the honourable judges through interpretation cannot insert words into the Constitution or rewrite the same.
“The spirit of the 18th Constitutional Amendment for the purposes of free and fair elections was to empower the Election Commission of Pakistan and have caretaker governments at the time of general elections. Therefore, to ensure the free and fair elections, it is imperative that elections for the national and provincial assemblies take place at the same time,” the resolution reads.
Earlier, as the resolution was moved in the house, the PTI MPAs stood up and protested. Leader of the Opposition Haleem Adil Shaikh and deputy parliamentary leader Khurrum Sher Zaman termed the resolution an attack on the judiciary and judges led by the chief justice of Pakistan.
They along with other party members chanted the slogans against the resolution in front of speaker’s podium and walked out of the session.
Khawaja Izharul Hassan of the MQM-P, while supporting the resolution, said that the party were neither against any judge nor were indulging in contempt of court. He added that elections must be held in the country in the same date. 
Information Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon opined that the judiciary had made controversial decisions in the past while citing the judicial order to execute PPP founder Zulfikar Ali Bhutto or the decision to oust PPP PM Yousaf Raza Gilani. “Such decisions are no longer acceptable to the people of Pakistan,” he added.

The resolution, moved by Health Minister Azra Pechuho, called upon all political parties, civil society organisations, and other stakeholders to join hands in upholding and defending the Constitution.
