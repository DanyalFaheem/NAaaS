3,Eagles creating nuisance in city,Meat meant for birds’ consumption is being sold openly,"A group of people who prey on animals and people, not literally but virtually, has emerged in the city, creating a nuisance for the flow of traffic and for pedestrians as well.
Their modus operandi is to exploit the people who want to be charitable towards the animals, eagles and other birds in this case.
There are two ways of doing so.
First is to feed the birds, and the second is to buy freedom for the ones who are in captivity.
So the miscreants need two things to run their business.
One is meat, and the other is to catch birds and cage them until some gentle soul comes to them and pay them the price of freeing the caged birds.
The other category of people buys meat and leaves it in the city’s thoroughfares for the eagles and other birds to swoop down on them and satiate their hunger.
Who do they buy the meat from? The meat meant for birds’ consumption is being sold openly in the areas of Canal Road, some areas along the Ravi, Thokar Niaz Baig and blocks of GT Road.
No wonder, then, that these areas become the hub where eagles and crows hover in large numbers in search of food, and when they spot it they land on it, leaving the motorcyclists threatened by their movement.
The more the meat is left in these areas the larger the number of eagles and crows that hover in these places and consequently greater the nuisance for the general public and, especially, the motorcyclists.
Ayeza Haider, a wildlife activist, said that the sellers of meat meant for eagles’ consumption put the stuff in red plastic bags.
The colour red is especially chosen so that eagles could easily spot these bags.
Ayeza Haider said that this practice not only endangered the birds' lives, but it also increased the number of eagles hovering in those areas.
A bloodthirsty eagle gliding towards the ground at full thrust could cause accidents involving human lives.
The focal person of The National Alliance of Animal Rights, Aneeza Khan Omer Zai, has sent photos and videos of bird sellers in different parts of the city to the district wildlife officer of Lahore.
Khan has demanded of the government to take serious action against those selling birds after captivating them.
Meanwhile, Punjab wildlife officials said that it was illegal to cage protected birds, and that action was being taken against those involved in this practice.

4,Carpet producers call for boosting exports,"PCMAEA calls for revisiting govt economic policies, taking stakeholders in confidence","The Pakistan Carpet Manufacturers and Exporters Association (PCMAEA) has stressed the need for re-formulation of the policies in the economic and other relevant fields in consultation with the stakeholders for effective and speedy measures to enhance the exports volume and revenue of the country.
Talking to the media on Sunday, the association's senior vice chairman Usman Ashraf said there was a dire need to remove unnecessary obstacles and reduce the cost of agricultural and industrial production to ensure an export-led economy.
He suggested that in order to increase the exports, a study of regional and other countries should be conducted and export promotion responsibilities should be assigned to Pakistani embassies by giving the commercial attachés export targets.
He said were pavilions of different countries at the superstores at the major airports of the world, where their products were displayed and Pakistan should also follow such business promotion strategies.
Usman Ashraf called for better use of social media tools to help increase exports.
“A system should be evolved under one roof for all exporters and fresh graduates can also market Pakistani products as well as conduct research studies to get aware of the trends in different countries,” he added.

5,Dozens of water plants in disrepair,Authorities fail to maintain facility launched due to decaying pipelines,"At least 45 of the 99 filtration plants installed in the city to supply clean drinking water to the citizens are non-functional because of shortage of funds and lack of adequate coordination and assignment of responsibilities between the government departments concerned.
According to officials concerned, the filters or a number of plants have also not been replaced in time, putting at risk the health of the people using water from the plants installed across the provincial capital.
In view of the situation, the authorities concerned have demanded Rs135 million from the provincial local government department to repair the filtration plants.
A large number of residents of the city depend on the filtration plants because the water supply lines in many areas have passed their viable lifetime without being replaced by the Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) due to lack of funds.
In view of complaints of contaminated water supply, the previous governments had installed the filtration plants in urban areas with the help of the municipal corporation, WASA, public health engineering and local government departments.
Sources in the Lahore Metropolitan Corporation told The Express Tribune that 99 water filtration plants had been installed in Lahore, out of which 54 were currently functioning and had now been handed over to the Punjab Aab-e-Pak Authority.
However, the 45 other plants are in disrepair.
The largest number of filtration plants are installed in the in Data Ganj Baksh zone, but only four of the 39 units are currently functioning and 35 are damaged.
It is estimated that Rs105 million would be required to repair them.
Of the seven filtration plants set up in Gulberg zone, four are functional and three are defective.
Four filtration plants have been installed in Allama Iqbal zone, out of which two are functional and as many are out of order.
On the other hand, all the 10 filtration plants installed in Ravi zone, 13 in Shalimar, 10 in Aziz Bhatti zone and four in Wagah are properly functioning.
Of the 12 plants installed in Samanabad zone, seven are functional and five non-functional.
However, the filters of a number of plants from where citizens are taking away water have not been replaced for a long time, causing concerns about the health of the users.
Local residents Muhammad Amir and Muhammad Farid said complaints of foul smell from the water collected from the filtration plants at Karim Park and Band Road were common.
They said WASA had not solved the problems despite complaints.
They said there was also confusion about the authority responsible for operating the plants.
The sources said the Aab-e-Pak Authority had taken the stance in a meeting presided over by the provincial local government secretary that the filtration plants should be repaired so that they could be operated after their handing over.
When contacted, WASA Managing Director Ghafran Ahmed said the organisation had been facing financial difficulties since long in maintain the filtration plants on a regular basis.
Local Government Secretary Dr Muhammad Irshad told The Express Tribune that it was the responsibility of the institutions concerned to provide clean water to the citizens and they tried to provide the best facilities by utilising the existing resources.
He said 54 filtration plants had been handed over to the Aab-e- Pak Authority, while WASA and the metropolitan corporation had been given the responsibility to make functional the remaining plants that required repair.
He said efforts were being made to ensure the repair of the filtration plants.
The provincial secretary said instructions had also been issued to the departments concerned to replace the filters of the plants and write the date of the replacement at each facility o that the officers and citizens would know the due date of the next replacement.
“This measure will help ensure the supply of clean water to the citizens,” he added.
He said it had been decided that all the filtration plants would be handed over to the Aab-e-Pak Authority so that only one organisation would be responsible for the service.
