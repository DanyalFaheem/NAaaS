“The students will be imparted photography and video-making skills under the newly conceived project titled, “Media Project for Conservation of Environment and Nature”, PMNH Director General Dr Saima Huma Tanveer said.
“These students will be trained on capturing different aspects of environment and nature including flowers, birds, mountains, rivers etc”, she said.
“The use of social media platforms among students of all ages is at its peak who seem to be interested to create their own Youtube channels, TikTok and Facebook accounts for the sake of fun and money making.

1,Experts call for national nutrition policy,"Say Pakistan faces triple burden of overnutrition, undernutrition and hidden hunger","Nutritionists and dietitians Sunday emphaised the need for formulation of a national nutrition policy (NNP) to raise awareness of the significance of nutrition and its impact on the health of present and future generations.
They were speaking at a seminar, organised by the National University of Medical Sciences (NUMS)’s Department of Nutrition and Dietetics (DND) to celebrate “March Nutrition Month” - being celebrated across the world with the theme “Fuel for the Future.”
Dr Abdul Momin Rizwan, Head of the Department of Nutrition and Dietetics at NUMS in his remarks said it was imperative to have National Nutrition Policy (NNP) for a country like Pakistan as it was facing a triple burden of malnutrition including overnutrition, undernutrition and hidden hunger (micronutrient deficiencies) which were extremely common in the country.
These issues can be addressed through NNP which will be executed at the national and provincial levels with clear guidelines and goals.
He said some good work in bits and pieces, was being done in the public and private sectors but that was not yielding desired results to root-out malnutrition.
Shahid Fazal, a nutrition expert and Regional Advisor at Nutritional International, an international Non-Governmental Organisation said that a consensus on NNP among the provinces was necessary for the formulation of such policy to ensure uniformity in its implementation at the provincial level to achieve the set goals.
Referring to a report launched by the Pakistan Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Secretariat at the Ministry of Planning Development & Reform, in collaboration with the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), Shahid Fazal said the consequences of malnutrition was costing Pakistan $7.6 billion per year.
Dr Umar Farooq of NUMS said if the available data was analysed, 50 per cent of the Pakistan population would be found to have some sort of nutrient deficiencies.
He said unstoppable urbanisation and reduction in the production areas in the country would increase food security issues and non-communicable diseases. The problem of malnutrition with its many facets needs to be tackled at the national level.
Senior policy advisor at Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition(GAIN) said that under the chairmanship of the planning commission, some policy work had started and GAIN was also helping them to chalk out NNP which was expected to be finalised this year.
Once formulated, NNP would be put up to the Council of Common Interest for approval which would give it acceptance and recognition at the national level, said Faiz Rasool.
He called for the inclusion of the youth as well as the implications of climate change in the Food Security Policy for ensuring its success. He said there was some work going on to include nutrition subjects at the grassroots level as some educational institutions had offered nutrition-related subjects.

7,"‘US, Pakistan have to work together to cope with climate crisis’",Top US official says both countries engaged to tackle plastic pollution in Pakistan,"US Assistant Secretary for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs Monica P Medina has said that the governments of the United States (US) and Pakistan have great room to work together on the Green Climate Fund (GCF) to cope with climate challenges caused by global warming and environmental degradation.
During an interaction with media persons about the outcomes of the ministerial dialogue on climate change, Medina said: “One thing that we really need to work on together is with respect to the GCF which is one of the largest fund donors of the projects to deal with climate change in the world. She said that both Pakistan and US governments were going to co-chair the board of directors at the key moment when the countries were looking to get more funding from the Fund for the communities that were being hit hardest by climate change.
She underlined that it was a tremendous opportunity for the US and Pakistan in particular to work together to help solve climate challenges. Medina said Pakistan is a very important partner and a friend of the US.
“We have very meaningful and deep relationships and lots of people-to-people ties, strong bilateral exchanges and we are working together on global climate and environmental challenges as these challenges we know hit close to home.""
The US official said the world countries were already facing horrible climate impacts but the devastating floods in Pakistan last year caught everyone's attention. ""We worked closely with the Pakistani government in the wake of the floodings. Since these terrible events, the US announced more than $200 million in flood relief, food security, disaster preparedness and other recovery efforts. We are very pleased to be able to do that as well as lending a lot of expertise too in trying to figure out ways to prevent and adapt to these sorts of climate stressors,” she said.
She said that the US administration had realised that both countries would have to move forward to mitigate the climate crisis by working together.
“US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry would have been here but his busy schedule did not permit him,” she added.

8,Newly appointed teachers await salaries,Dozens of female instructors suffer from mental agony owing to non-disbursement of salaries for seven months,"The newly appointed female primary teachers of the Ghazi region are awaiting to receive their salaries even after seven months of their postings.
Sources said since the transfer of SDEO Education Ghazi last month, no one has been assigned the powers of Drawing and Disbursement Officer (DDO), adding to the woes of the newly appointed female teaching staff.
According to sources, the secretary of education has been requested to provide relief to the affected teachers from the distressing situation while the Education Office (male) has assured provision of salaries soon.
The sources said that on September 3, 2022, female primary teachers were appointed in Ghazi and the DEO Office (female) Haripur had made it mandatory that the salaries of the newly appointed teachers will not be released until the verification of their educational documents. However, the verifications issued by some of the boards were sent to the Haripur office but they allegedly went missing from the office due to negligence and then they had to undergo the process again.
The sources have also said that a message was sent by the affected female teachers to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s director of education to resolve their problems, after which a clear instruction was issued to all the DEOs that the salaries of the affected teachers should be released soon and a report should be sent to the Directorate of Education, Peshawar, but the salaries were still not released.
According to the officials of the accounts office, the checks issued by the office on March 1, 2023, were sent to the SDOs. Providing the salaries of any department on time is the responsibility of the departmental accounts office.
The officials in charge of the education office (female) have said that the SDEO (female) of Ghazi was transferred on February 18. “Her post was still vacant and the temporary charge of handling the issues of salaries etc.
Has not been handed over to anyone yet due to which seven months’ salary cheques of the nine newly appointed primary teachers of Ghazi are still pending,” they explained. “As soon as an officer is appointed, the checks will be released with her signature,” they said.
Dozens of female teachers have been suffering from severe mental anguish due to the non-issuance of their salaries for the past seven months.
On being contacted about this situation, Mumtaz Khan, Budget and Accounts Officer of the Department of Education, said that male and female SDOs in Ghazi were appointed two days ago. “As per the rules and regulations, only an authorised officer is allowed to sign the released salary cheques. Due to non-placement, there has been a delay in releasing salaries, taking notice of which the required placement has been made in Ghazi. Now all teachers’ salaries will be released soon,” he claimed.
Meanwhile, political leader Imran Alizai said that due to undue political interference, male and female offices of the education department had become political arenas.
“Incompetent persons with political backing have been illegally appointed to higher positions which will plague this department like the TMA has been with political vendettas,” he said.
He alleged that it was unfortunate for the district that the appointment and transfer of school principals of grades 17 and 18 were being done by the class four secretary of a local politician who was himself a watchman or a driver.
“Due to this lawlessness, dozens of teachers cannot come forward for fear of reprisals. There are numerous instances where scores of male and female teachers have been targeted in the name of bogus inquiries,” he claimed.

9,Illegal transplant case: Physical remand of accused extended,"Police include murder provision against suspects after autopsy of man, who died during operation","Civil Judge Wajiha Khawaj on Sunday extended for four days the physical remand of nine accused including three doctors in the illegal organ trade and kidney transplant case.
The suspects were produced in the court after the expiry of their three-day physical remand.
Investigating Officer Ghulam Murtaza produced the suspects, Dr Zahid Mukhtar Bukhari, Dr Latif Abid, Israr Hussain Shah, Shahzad Altaf, Shahnawaz, Muhammad Asim, Muhammad Imran, Rashid Mehmood and Anas Rehman in the judicial complex and requested a seven-day physical remand.
The court while granting physical remand for four days ordered the investigation officer to produce the accused on March 22.
The body of the patient who died in the hospital was transferred to the district headquarters hospital for a post-mortem
The police said raids were under way to arrest three fugitives including Dr Athar, who have gone into hiding after police made the arrests. Provision of 302 (murder case) has also been included in the case filed after the autopsy of Iftikhar Ali’s body, police said.
The body of Iftikhar Ali, a resident of Jaranwala, was handed over to the heirs after a post-mortem on Sunday.
Earlier, the Punjab Human Organ Transplant Authority (PHOTA) and Rawalpindi police raided a private hospital involved in illegal organ transplants of patients and arrested nine suspects including three doctors for their alleged involvement in illegal transplants.
According to police, a 65-year-old man, Iftikhar Ali, died while being operated upon during the illegal transplant while one person was shifted to a hospital in critical condition.
The police said that Dr Zahid was arrested in the past for his involvement in illegal organ transplantation and kidney sale.
Police also seized Rs20 million in cash from the private hospital and rounded up 15 patients, including a foreigner.
PHOTA Assistant Director (technical) Faraz Ahmed earlier said that the private hospital was raided on a tip-off that illegal transplants were being carried out there.
He said that 15 patients were recovered from the hospital and of them, two were in critical condition. He said that all the patients were transferred to government hospitals.
The accused used to carry out kidney transplants illegally and earn millions of rupees. They used to buy kidneys from the poor for Rs0.1 million and sell them for up to Rs5 million.
Earlier, Rawalpindi police arrested three suspected traffickers including two nurses from the Jand area.
The Rawat police arrested a man and two nurses who were allegedly involved in the illegal organ trade and transplantation of kidneys.
Police had recovered surgical equipment and a vehicle during a raid on two houses in a private housing society located in the vicinity of Rawat.
The two houses in the housing society were being used for the illegal organ trade. Police said that the houses had been by rented the accused for carrying out the illegal organ trade.
Police earlier said that the suspected two women had escaped the location leaving behind surgical equipment and other belongings including a vehicle after the police arrested one of their accomplices.
Police said that raids were underway for the arrest of the doctor, identified as Imran, who is said to be the ringleader of illegal kidney transplantation. The doctor is said to have fled to Lahore after the police arrested his accomplices.
Pakistan has long been an international hub for the illegal kidney trade, but authorities have been unable to act against the practice due to ineffective enforcement policies and a lack of political will to crack down. In Pakistan, organ donation is legal so long as it is voluntary, given without duress or the exchange of money. The limited supply sees the wealthy routinely exploit thousands of poor with the help of an organ trade mafia.
