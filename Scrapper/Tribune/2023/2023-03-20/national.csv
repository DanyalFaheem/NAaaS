0,"As IMF shifts towards inclusive growth, is Pakistan ready?","Islamabad among nations that have lowest inclusive growth, low access to education, health","Pakistan’s decades-old policies that give preferential access to state resources to a select few sectors and ensure strong government footprints have placed it among nations that have the lowest inclusive growth and low access to education and healthcare, endangering the unparalleled demographic dividends.
A book of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), “Promoting Inclusive Growth in the Middle East and North Africa: Challenges and Opportunities in a Post-Pandemic World”, outlines the prevailing poor economic conditions in a part of the world to which Pakistan also belongs.
The countries that have the lowest inclusive growth scores are Yemen, Mauritania and Pakistan. They lag behind other countries in the private sector and financial inclusion the most.
In terms of access to education, Iran, Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Lebanon, and Pakistan rank below average for the rest of the world. Within the region, Mauritania, Pakistan and Yemen are the ones that most seem to struggle to provide basic health services to their residents.
So much so, less than 15% of the poorest population have bank accounts and less than 6% have bank loans in Mauritania, Pakistan and Yemen. Just across the border in Iran, about 92% of the poorest 40% of population have bank accounts, 21% borrowing from a financial institution and 84% of the population using internet.
These stark contrasts tell how exclusive economic growth has remained in the region, including Pakistan, which has faced many wars and insurgencies and the young unemployed population could become a fodder to these militant groups.
Besides, the discontent population has tried to oust governments through the Arab Spring, forcing the key stakeholders to review their policies. The IMF, which often faces criticism for causing high unemployment and low economic growth through its fiscal stabilisation policies, has now triggered a debate about the interplay between inclusive and sustainable growth.
The global lender is poised to formally unveil its new set of policies in Marrakesh, the economic centre and home to mosques and gardens – during the October 2023 World Bank-IMF Annual Meetings.
In 2018, the IMF had organised a regional conference at the same venue. The participants were of the strong opinion that MENA countries needed to change their economic models, and indeed build a new social contract to create more jobs, lift growth, and ensure that the benefits of economic development accrue more broadly to their citizens.
The elite capture is probably more pronounced in Pakistan than many countries in the region, thanks to the rich-centric policies, which have also lately come on the radar of the IMF.
“There is fundamentally great potential in Pakistan for raising economic growth and making it more inclusive,” said Nathan Porter, IMF Mission Chief, last week during a seminar organised at the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) to discuss the future economic agenda.
Over the past two decades, Pakistan’s labour force participation has been low, and investment rate has been around 15% of GDP, which is well below the best performers of the region.
There is continuing reliance on policies that promote subsidies and preferential treatment to some sectors, which are not the solutions to the low human capital development and low investments in Pakistan, said Porter. “We need to think about a new approach,” he added.
Making growth inclusive and tackling these challenges really comes about bridging Pakistan’s labour force participation and investment rates over the next 10 years, the IMF mission chief said.
Porter argued that reducing state footprints will create breathing room for the private sector and will also strengthen the business environment. The recent adoption of a new state-owned enterprises (SOE) law will improve governance and should help more efficient use of state resources, said the mission chief.
He also emphasised on reducing anti-export biases through tariff policies and export promotion schemes.
During the recent policy dialogue under the $6.5 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF), the IMF pushed Pakistan towards taking steps that are necessary to end the monopoly of a few businesses on the state’s resources.
It has minimised the difference between the policy rate and the export refinancing schemes’ rates that once used to be too large to the benefit of a few industrialists.
The few business-centric economic policies have led to low inclusive growth and as a result employment in the country is less than 50% of the working-age population.
Subsidies are not drivers of strong business development as these benefit a few and the limited resources are not going to the most productive sectors of the economy, said Porter. These subsidies are not helping in creating sustainable employment opportunities and sustainable exports, added the mission chief.
Pakistan should tap its female labour force, as there is only one woman and three men in the labour force. Many women are working in the agriculture sector without remuneration, he said.
Gender gap alone is costing Pakistan Rs500 billion annually and closing it can boost GDP by 30%, said Ayesha Javed, Deputy Secretary Budget of the Ministry of Finance. There is a young demographic dividend to be taken in the next couple of decades and the reforms done in the right way can help reduce poverty and inequality, advised the IMF mission chief.
In its book, the IMF stated that 10 years after the Arab Spring, the need to ensure more and fairer opportunities for all – and, in particular, opportunities for the young people, women, and entrepreneurs – remains a key priority for MENA countries.
Demographic changes, evolving climate conditions, the impact of automation and artificial intelligence in job markets all pose new challenges to the longstanding issues of high unemployment and deep inequalities in the region.
Inclusive growth is gaining focus in the region but it does not mean that macroeconomic stability is no longer on the agenda, rather the IMF is moving towards inclusive growth in a stable macroeconomic environment, said Dr Ashfaque Hasan Khan, Principal of Social Sciences School and Humanities, NUST.
Khan argued that there is a need for change in conventional policies of the IMF, as the policies that promote stabilisation today and growth later have to be changed to inclusive growth policies without compromising macroeconomic stability.
NUST Professor Dr Athar Maqsood sought more clarity in the IMF-World Bank policies, citing examples from the past where the policies increased inefficiencies in the power sector and taxation system of Pakistan.
“In a country where average growth rate is 3% and population growth is 2.5%, enough employment opportunities cannot be generated. We have the highest unemployment rate and the demographic dividend has turned into a demographic disaster,” said Maqsood.

1,The value-added tax conundrum,True potential of sales tax is at least double the amount collected last fiscal year,"As per the Bureau of Statistics, Pakistan’s nominal GDP in the year ending June 2022 was Rs67 trillion, in which consumption numbers were as high as Rs63 trillion. The figures must now have gone way north due to very high inflation in the last eight months but let’s stick to the published numbers of June 30, 2022.
The largest spinner of tax by the FBR and provinces is the consumption tax levied in the form of sales tax on goods and services.
The FBR collected Rs2,530 billion in sales tax on goods. Provinces collected about Rs350 billion in sales tax on services and even if we add the federal excise duty (FED) of Rs320 billion, (which can be considered as a type of additional sales tax in its current form), the total sales tax on goods and services was about Rs3,200 billion against consumption of Rs63,000 billion, yielding an effective rate of 5% as opposed to the general rate of 17% prevalent at that time.
Even if we ignore the 20% of consumption being related to unprocessed agricultural crops and slaughtered animals, and subtract another 10% on account of poor people consumption of informal services and goods, the effective rate still works out to be 7.25%, which is almost 10% less than the headline rate.
Even for the most lenient estimates (after accounting for the reluctance of federal government to levy sales tax on POL products last year), the true potential of sales tax is at least double the amount collected in the last financial year.
Actually, this tax has the potential to transform the tax-to-GDP ratio from the current 9.5% to about 15% in three years on its own.
Though one can argue that more and more taxes are bad for growth, yet one cannot deny that fetching a reasonable amount of taxes is now a question of state security because of the yawning fiscal deficit we are facing.
Traditionally, it was assumed that indirect taxes are inflationary in nature and are blamed for a larger drop in output levels. However, the consumption taxes, such as the value-added tax (VAT) or general sales tax (GST), remain one of the most important means of taxation throughout the world.
Cutting-edge research on taxes is now gravitating towards lesser and lesser discussion of classification of taxes into direct and indirect taxes.
Many of the researchers have shown that unlike their theoretical representation, the incidence of so-called direct taxes also travels beyond the payer of tax and can cause as much inflation and loss of output as any other broad-based indirect tax.
For example, if we increase the income tax rate of a large corporation with significant market power, it can always pass this tax on to its customers, employees, shareholders, suppliers or lenders by re-negotiating terms of contracts.
A tax on cigarettes of father can very well translate into cut-down on ice cream and candies of his son, rather than having an impact on the consumption of cigarettes. This blurriness between direct and indirect taxes is now forcing more and more tax experts to think about optimum taxation in terms of broad-based taxes with least number of exemptions.
Our current sales tax system, levied in VAT mode, is in theoretical terms progressive in its structure, where there is a large-scale exemption on home-cooked food, home-sewn clothing, shelter and medicine. Moreover, now the normal packaged goods are subjected to 18% tax and high-end luxury consumption (luxury vehicles, expensive phones, etc) is subjected to 25% taxation.
Our failure to collect reasonably good money from this most important revenue resource has its historical, political, procedural and operational causes.
Historically speaking, the GST, before its conversion into VAT in 1990, was mainly collected as a single-stage tax from importers and manufacturers. Even today, almost 90% of this tax is coming from this historical resource.
On the contrary, in Europe, the evolution of VAT was on the basis of working backwards from retail outlets to import, mining or agriculture. This traditional tax collection base of our VAT system has never been allowed to become a true raw material-to-retail VAT system.
Politically, we introduced sales tax on services in 1997, on the basis of provincial laws, with collection-operation awarded to the FBR. Pakistan is one the five or six unique jurisdictions in the world where the tax base of VAT system is fragmented between the federation and provinces on the basis of goods and services (India, Canada and Australia being notable others).
After the 18th Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan, the provinces started forming their own tax collection agencies (SRB, PRA, KPRA and BRA) one by one. These agencies then started growing in size and area of influence.
While other countries, including the EU, resolved the issue of fragmented tax base by the unification or integration of tax base, Pakistan opted for a unique mechanism of harmonisation of VAT.
Though a lot of effort has been put in by international agencies, the Ministry of Finance, FBR and provinces in the last decade, the cost of compliance with VAT is still on the rise.
Generally, a company doing business all over Pakistan is now required to file 60 VAT returns every year. In addition, there are legal issues in the definition of goods and services, different rates and procedures in every province, administrative issues in the adjustment of input taxes and inter-provincial dispute on the basis of taxation (origin vs destination debate).
Though for the time being, there is a broad consensus on these issues, reached in the National Tax Committee (NTC), yet in future the provincial governments can disrupt the consensus by unilateral actions, especially in new forms of goods and services. As a result, such harmonisation will always remain a temporary solution unless a constitutional amendment is made to resolve the issue permanently (India did it in 2017).
Administratively, the FBR is far away from having eyes on a complete value chain. The recent initiatives of Point of Sales (POS) monitoring, track and trace, and digital invoicing are steps in the right direction but at the moment remain pretty ineffective in enforcing reasonable compliance.
The EU and East Asian economies have developed far more robust and efficient systems and luckily such VAT systems are available even off the shelf and a little investment in these systems can bring significant dividends over a period of two to three years.
It appears that 80% of VAT collection is coming from some 40,000 manufacturers. A more disturbing number is the non-manufacturer/ non-importer VAT filers of 22,000 establishments.
It represents the wholesale and retail trade where the number of significant establishments in the country is not less than 2 million (almost 4 million commercial electricity connections).
Similarly, tax filing by 40,000 manufacturers in a country having almost 350,000 industrial connections also raises red flags.
The disappearance of importers by filing null (no further tax is payable) is not only disturbing but is a major source of flying invoices. The FBR with its limited workforce and resources cannot on its own revolutionise these numbers.
A robust IT system for VAT, with tracking of imports and manufacturing till the retail outlet, is the real solution which needs to be implemented on a fast-track basis, to pluck this low hanging fruit.

2,Savings in high interest rate environment,"In case of price rise, discretionary expenses should be cut, funds directed towards essentials","In the wake of current political and economic fiasco, Pakistanis are experiencing a period of life-time high interest rates.
The government has taken steps to curtail imports and reduced subsidies, alongside fiscal and quantitative tightening. Debate exists on the fallout of these steps with endless discussions on the right course to chart and the timing of the steps.
The current recessionary trend is global and has hit international demand substantially. The Covid period was a time of primarily supply shock/ shortages with potential exit from the situation as supply chain bottlenecks got hammered out.
The recent scenario is ‘demand-led’, resulting in overheating of various global economies. Consequently, retail prices are biting the pockets of the end-consumer, resulting in reduced sales and a supply glut.
Below is an attempt to chart a path that can be followed in these testing times.
Budgeting expenses
Starting point for any saving strategy to succeed is to plan and have a pre-decided list of expenses. In a high-inflation environment, it’s difficult to estimate the cost of groceries and utilities but listing them is the starting point.
Budgeting expenses helps ensure that financial obligations are met, desired lifestyle is achieved and overspending is avoided. Budgeting should cover all essential expenses like rent, utilities, transportation, groceries and loan repayments and also slice in discretionary expenses like dining out and entertainment.
Bifurcating between essentials and discretionary would ensure that in case of a price rise, discretionary expenses are reduced and funds are directed towards essentials.
Build an emergency fund
Alongside listing expenses or consumption that we plan to undertake, it’s important to plan for an “emergency fund”. Creation of this fund as part of the budgeting activity and considering this as current spending ensures that this is undertaken before we start gnawing on income flows for daily expenses.
To determine the size of the fund, the rule of thumb is to build a nest that covers at least three to six months’ worth of living expenses and some extras for emergency medical expenses. In the current period of high interest rates, return on the emergency fund will be higher, making it more lucrative to have this fund.
Saving goal
While targeting expenses, it is very important that we set various short- and long-term goals that we want to achieve in life and calculate the financial outlays for these.
Setting goals, working towards them, and achieving them would help us reach the pinnacle of success in life and potentially internal peace.
Saving money should become a habit, like brushing your teeth or exercising. It would be a good idea to discuss the goals with your partner, kids, and/or parents, ensuring that the entire family is aligned towards delivering the goal.
Set up auto-recurring transfers on your salary or income account to ensure that the targeted saving is taken off from the income account on day one. This would push us to cut down on discretionary expenses in case of any inflationary pressure rather than reducing savings.
Review your finances monthly or quarterly and make necessary adjustments as warranted by the broader economic situation. Adjustments to the saving speed may be required as we move ahead and get near or drift apart from the targeted funding.
Higher-yielding assets
The strategy is to ensure that your money works for you and one doesn’t get blinded by higher returns. Create a portfolio that attempts to beat inflation, resulting in a positive return on the consumption sacrificed.
Look for accounts offering competitive returns, low fees, and no minimum balance requirements.
It’s important to balance the risk while targeting to earn competitive returns. One should undertake research to understand the risks before investing.
Riskier and non-liquid assets should also be considered like term deposits, investments into T-bills/ PIBs/ Sukuks or into CDNS products, balanced or aggressive mutual funds, and direct equity. Consider consulting with a financial adviser to help identify investment opportunities aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.
Debt snowball or debt avalanche
Pay off high-interest debt, such as credit card debt or a personal loan, as quickly as possible. Consider using the debt snowball or debt avalanche method for repayment.
Debt snowball involves paying off the smallest debt first, then using the funds to pay off your next smallest debt, and so on. This method ensures we remain motivated as we knock debt off our list of payables.
Debt avalanche involves paying off your debt with the highest interest rate first, then using that payment to pay off your next highest interest rate debt, and so on. In a high interest rate environment, the debt avalanche method is preferred.
Two key guiding principles in the savings journey are i) Be disciplined ii) Be patient.
Saving money requires discipline and self-control. Stick to the budget and avoid unnecessary expenses.
Saving money takes time. Don’t get discouraged, keep saving and stay focused on the goals. Over time, savings will grow resulting in a better financial position.

3,Living with data breaches in unregulated cyberspace,It becomes critical to form and train cyber force to assist govt in tackling cyber conflict,"Data fusion, cloud computing and internet-enabled devices have brought us the greatest threat since the Cold War: the risk of cyber-attacks from proxy states.
With Pakistan’s public sector institutions frequently being attacked by the terrorist adversaries operating the anonymous TOR networks, it is becoming critical to train and organise a cyber force to assist the government in managing the escalation in case of a cyber conflict.
Recently, LeakBase accessed the consumer data of Paysys Labs, an intermediary that integrates SBP’s Raast services through its middleware, and published data of more than 50,000 users on the dark web.
Philippine Cyber Alliance has attempted to attack over a dozen government websites this month; not to mention some cyber terror group that has published personal details of the Punjab government employees.
Data of many private companies such as AM International and medIQ has reportedly been released on hacker forums.
It is crystal clear that individuals, businesses, and local governments can’t bear this additional burden of ensuring cyber security and this domain must be dealt by specialist organisations with niche technology to safeguard from these attacks. Not only short-term defensive measures are required urgently, but there is also a need to take a strategic approach to build resilience in IT systems.
What it means for policymakers is to isolate database systems from each other, wherever possible, and avoid funding programmes that lead to data fusion. For example, integrating NADRA, FBR and banking systems is too dangerous, though such an integrated system offers a dream dashboard for authorities.
Though their individual APIs are secure, the architecture inherently promises too much power for hackers.
Similarly, the fact that NTDC has online dashboard available, which could be manipulated by any malicious user, is prone to attack incidents in the entire electricity supply chain. Russia has been attacking Ukrainian infrastructure including power grids and banks for a decade now.
Tracking such an attack or locating the cyber terrorists is tricky. A Russian hacker, over a VPN running in the US, may be using phishing emails to install malicious software in computers connected to our government’s intranet for stealing data by uploading it on a Chinese cloud server.
Using the US as a proxy to launch attack while collecting data on another server in China makes it difficult to geolocate such individuals. Tracking people in cyberspace becomes a jurisdictional nightmare, making cyber warfare a weapon of choice for ransom groups.
With multiple elections due to be conducted this year, adequate cyber security measures need to be taken timely as many countries have cyber weapons to influence election results as well as public opinion.
By leveraging social media platforms run by Meta, it is very easy to use behavioural tools along with targeted ads to influence public sentiment on lines of Cambridge Analytica.
What we need to do is to create awareness for promoting data privacy and best practices to handle the online public data at large. Resilience of our critical infrastructure and essential services must be the top priority and strict SOPs need to be built into the system.
Cyber audits need to be conducted by the concerned regulatory authorities of critical assets including the banking system and security auditors need to thoroughly review protocol stacks and software components every quarter; building a list of every components’ license, patch releases, and dependencies.
So, in case a particular software component gets compromised, all organisations whose IT systems were built using that component could be timely alerted.
However, cyber security can also lead to less ease of doing business as a stringent SOP can slow down the clock speed of commercial operations.
For example, if NADRA stops issuing online ID cards and other certificates, fearing that fingerprints and signatures could be leaked and forged on illegally issued stamp papers to seal fake contracts, the inconvenience caused to an ordinary citizen will be enormous.
Similarly, the IoT devices that are penetrating quickly among the masses to control household appliances remotely are a great convenience but unfortunately all our data also get dumped into servers located overseas.
In a worst-case scenario, our electrical appliances could also be controlled by any foreign cyber terrorist or a ransomware group.
Overall, the future of cyber security will require continued investment in latest technologies and approaches to keep pace with the evolving threats.
However, surveillance of citizens on the pretext of cyber security must be discouraged and a policy shift towards cyber security that ensures minimal infringement on citizens’ rights of privacy is needed while taking holistic security measures.

4,Can Pakistan buy back its Eurobonds?,Borrowing at 9-11% to buy instruments at 20-30% returns is good profitable trade,"Efficient management of companies – as well as countries – demands eyeing every opportunity to make every single day and penny count. It is no wonder then, that global executives are constantly on the look-out to deploy assets, where financial jiggery-pottery is used, to structure ways to increase profits.
Perhaps, Pakistan’s policy makers should also comprise of similar wizards who can find innovative ways of creating wealth. One such option is possibly buying back the global debt and bonds issued.
To explain the concept: Pakistan raised US dollars (via a loan) in the international market. This was done by floating a few billion-dollar worth of instruments at a defined sovereign backed profit rate. Once the government raises the dollars, these instruments trade in a “secondary” market to provide ability to sell or buy (liquidity), to current and potential investors.
If the bond was issued at notional (face value) say $100, it may get priced higher at times when a country is doing well and demand is greater – conversely, it may be priced lower if the country is doing poorly.
As a direct result of political instability since regime change, delays over the International Monetary Funds (IMF) resuming its programme and tight global conditions, Pakistan’s dollar bonds issued at $100 are trading at a $35-$45 rate in the secondary markets. In other words, anyone buying at today’s rate would be getting an $8-9/per year profit on a purchase price of $35-$45, thereby getting 20-30% profits.
The fall in price is also a function of falling credit worthiness – seen as global credit watchdogs downgraded Pakistan’s ability to repay loans, increasing default profitability amid falling foreign exchange (FX) reserves.
This presents an opportunity. Even in the domestic bourse, Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), there are several examples of countries with financially sharp management buying back their shares (as they see long-term value) for example, Lucky Cement, Engro Corporation, Kohinoor Textile, JDW Sugar etc.
The reason why these corporates are actively engaging in such activities is an alignment of interest. Owners (seths) make money the right way while senior managers get rewarded with hefty bonuses. If only policy makers were to operate with such a fierce attitude towards finding timely windfall opportunities.
There also are a myriad example of countries buying back their debts; this year, Argentina – a country with a poorer economic record than Pakistan’s – sent across shockwaves as it announced the $1 billion bond buyback program despite being closely handheld by the IMF.
In 2022, El Salvador bought bonds worth $565M. In 2021, Indonesia announced a bond sale of $1.84 billion to buy back global bonds worth $1.16 billion.
Ecuador successfully bought back bonds in 2009 and issued another $1.125 billion in 2019 to buy back bonds. Even war-mired Russia announced a pre-emptive buyback of $2 billion last year to allay market concerns of financial distress.
Naturally, the next big question is: how do you finance these bonds? Well, instead of going into the global markets to issue new debt to buy old ones, Pakistan can try raising this capital using US dollars being kept by Pakistanis themselves in two ways:
1) A short term, time bound and amount bond scheme should be launched to attract dollars from overseas Pakistanis in Naya Pakistan Certificates (NPC) at 10-12% until the targeted $3-5 billion bonds are raised.
2) A similar window should be offered to US dollar account holders in Pakistan – individuals and corporates – at 9-11% to reduce hoarding under the carpet, bring dollars back in the banking system and enhance FX buggers.
While naysayers will find faults in offering such exorbitant profit rates on US dollar denominated debts, borrowing at 9-11% to buy instruments at 20-30% annual returns is a darn good profitable trade.
Messaging, however, is critical in this exercise. Policy makers should make firm commitments that savings of $0.5-2 billion – depending upon the risk appetite, courage and market conditions – will be categorically utilised for nation building, such as, country wide Information Technology (IT) training institutes, world class hospitals or even to finance Pakistan’s dilapidated Main Line (ML) Pakistan Railways. It is key to win the trust of the people back.
In Pakistan, we generally look at other countries or precedent instead of trying innovative or unchartered territories.
Perhaps, the fear of uncalled for investigations or no reward do not push brains to explore new ideas but, with plenty of successful examples cited earlier, there is a strong possibility of giving a sharp U-turn signal to the market worrying about Pakistan’s default and even nuclear program safety – and improve its credit worthiness.
When there is a will there’s a way. There is a silver (gold) lining amid murkier clouds as well. Don’t squander this opportunity the way we lost the opportunity to lock oil/LNG prices at lower rates post Covid-19.
