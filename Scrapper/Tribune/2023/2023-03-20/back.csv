0,Dammed thirsty: the cross-border fight for water,Huge dams being built by some countries while their neighbours go parched are a growing source of potential conflict,"With half the world experiencing water scarcity for at least part of the year, the huge dams being built by some countries to boost their power supplies while their neighbours go parched are a growing source of potential conflict.
Ahead of a UN conference in New York on global access to water, AFP looks at five mega-projects with very different consequences, depending on whether you live upstream or downstream.
The Indus River is one of the longest on the Asian continent, cutting through ultra-sensitive borders in the region, including the demarcation between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan in Kashmir.
The 1960 Indus Water Treaty theoretically shares out water between the two countries but has been fraught with disputes.
Pakistan has long feared that India, which sits upstream, could restrict its access, adversely affecting its agriculture. And India has threatened to do so on occasion.
In a sign of the tensions, the arch-rivals have built duelling power plants along the banks of the Kishanganga River, which flows into an Indus tributary.
The waters of Africa's longest river, the Nile, are at the centre of a decade-long dispute between Ethiopia — where the Nile's biggest tributary, the Blue Nile, rises — and its downstream neighbours Sudan and Egypt.
In 2011, Addis Ababa launched a $4.2 billion hydroelectric project on the river, which it sees as essential to lighting up rural Ethiopia.
Sudan and Egypt, however, see the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam as a threat to their water supplies — Egypt alone relies on the Nile for about 97 per cent of its irrigation and drinking water.
Ethiopia has insisted the dam will not disturb the flow of water and turned on the first turbine in February 2020.
Long used to drilling for oil, war-scarred Iraq is now digging ever deeper for water as a frenzy of dam-building, mainly in Turkey, sucks water out of the region's two great rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates.
Turkey launched the construction of a gigantic complex of dams and hydroelectric plants across the southeast in the 1980s.
In 1990 it completed the huge Ataturk Dam on the Euphrates River, just 80 kilometres (50 miles) from Syria's border.
More recently, in 2019, the ancient town of Hasankeyf on the Tigris was submerged to make way for the massive Ilisu Dam.
Iraq and Syria say Turkey's dam-building has resulted in a drastic reduction of the water flowing through their lands.
Baghdad regularly asks Ankara to release more water to counter drought, but Turkey's ambassador to Iraq, Ali Riza Guney, ruffled feathers last July when he said, ""water is largely wasted in Iraq"".
Syria's Kurds meanwhile have accused their arch-foe Turkey of weaponising the Euphrates, accusing it of deliberately holding back water to spark a drought, which Ankara denies.
China is a frenetic dam builder, constructing 50,000 dams in the Yangtze basin in the past 70 years — including the infamous Three Gorges.
But it is China's projects on the Mekong River, which rises in China and twists south through Thailand, Laos, Myanmar, Cambodia and Vietnam, that most alarm its neighbours.
The Mekong feeds more than 60 million people through its basin and tributaries.
Washington has blamed China's actions for causing severe droughts in Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.
In 2019, the US monitor Eyes on Earth published satellite imagery showing the dams in China holding ""above-average natural flow"".
Beijing insists its reservoirs help to maintain the stability of the river, by storing water in the rainy season and releasing it in the dry season.
The Itaipu hydroelectric plant, situated on the Parana River on the Brazil-Paraguay border, has often been the source of tensions between the two co-owner nations.
One of the two hydroelectricity plants that produce the most power in the world, alongside China's Three Gorges, had its energy shared out under a 1973 treaty.
But Paraguay demanded more and eventually got three times more money from Brazil, which uses 85 per cent of the electricity produced.
In 2019, a new deal on the sale of power from Itaipu nearly brought down Paraguay's government, with experts arguing it would reduce Paraguay's access to cheap power.
The two countries promptly cancelled the deal.

1,"Rumours of ‘rift’ between K-P governor, caretaker CM",CM House spokesperson terms the reports regarding Azam’s resignation rumours,"Reports regarding the resignation of caretaker Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mohammad Azam Khan over differences with Governor Haji Ghulam Ali were doing the rounds on Monday.
However, the K-P CM House spokesperson termed the reports regarding Azam’s resignation rumours, saying it’s just a propaganda being circulated on social media due to his differences with Governor Ali.
“The governor is biased. It is not possible to conduct a free and fair election with him [on the post],” the spokesperson said quoting caretaker CM Azam.
The reports circulating on social media quoted the chief minister saying: “When the governor has all the power, what is my need.”

The spokesperson said that there was no truth in the reports about the resignation of the caretaker chief minister, “it is just a rumour”.
Further, reports of differences between the caretaker CM and the chief secretary were also being circulated on social media.
PTI moves SC against K-P governor, ECP
Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader Mushtaq Ahmad Ghani on Monday filed a contempt petition against the K-P governor and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for not announcing the date of elections in the province, saying it is a violation the Supreme Court (SC) order.
The petition maintained that the governor “willfully chose to ignore the exalted status of his high constitutional office”, adding that he is “already in breach of his constitutional responsibilities and that he must appoint the date for holding the general election to the K-P Assembly”.
The PTI leader requested the court to initiate judicial proceedings against the governor and “punish him accordingly”.
Ghani also requested the apex court to get its order – announcing the election date – implemented.
“Respondent 1 [K-P governor] is not willing or ready to appoint such date, this Honorable Court may either direct that President or any other suitable functionary to appoint such date for poll or fix the date itself, as has been done in a previous election,” the petition concluded.

Sixty-two days have passed since the K-P Assembly was dissolved, but the date of the election has not yet been announced. The apex court had also ordered the governor to give the date for polls in the province.
Earlier this month, the Supreme Court announced its verdict after two-day-long proceedings in the case regarding the delay in the announcement of the date for provincial elections in Punjab and K-P.
The apex court ordered that elections in both assemblies should be held in the next 90 days, with the chief justice saying: ""Democracy cannot exist without assemblies.""

2,Qureshi demands of Dar to clarify nukes statement,PTI vice chairman also asks foreign ministry to give explanation,"Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi has demanded of Finance Minister Ishaq Dar to clarify his statement regarding ‘not compromising on the country’s nuclear programme’ given in the Senate.
Last week, finance minister Ishaq Dar, in his address to the Senate, had said that Pakistan would not compromise on its nuclear programme for reviving the stalled IMF loan facility. His comment came in response to Senator Raza Rabbani’s concerns that he raised during a Senate session, wherein he asked whether the IMF programme was being delayed to force the government into resorting to moves that were against state interests.
Addressing a news conference on Sunday, the former foreign minister asked Dar to clarify whether the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had asked Pakistan to give up its nuclear weapons for the revival of the bailout package.
Qureshi underscored that the finance minister was a close relative of the ruling PML-N and his statement of critical national assets on the Senate floor was significant and could not be ignored.
“Dar’s statement has created a new crisis in the country. The Foreign Office spokesperson should also give a clarification in her weekly briefing.
On Friday, the FO vehemently denied that Pakistan’s nuclear programme was on the agenda with any “government, financial institution, or any international organisation"".
The statement from spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch at a weekly news briefing came against the backdrop of speculations that Pakistan was under pressure to roll back its long-range nuclear missile programme.
Qureshi questioned why the spokesperson indicated that negotiations concerning nuclear power were not on the agenda of talks with any country or financial institution, asking why Dar had to give a statement on the Senate floor.
The PTI vice chairman asked the finance minister to tell the nation if the IMF had asked him for Pakistan’s nuclear programme. “What was need for giving such a big statement on the floor of the house? No one has the right to ask Pakistan about our nuclear programme. Our nuclear weapons are for our defence,” he underscored.
He highlighted that Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Senator Raza Rabbani also asked Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to give a policy statement on nuclear weapons.
He urged his successor at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari to also issue clarification.
On March 6, Rabbani said in a statement that the people of Pakistan had the right to know if the country’s strategic relationship with China or its nuclear assets were under strain.
“The people of Pakistan have a right to know if our strategic relationship with China or our nuclear assets are under threat or pressure … or if we are being called up to play a role in the region which will facilitate the military presence of an imperialist power.”
The statement came amid questions being raised in the media that due to the pressure on the country’s dwindling foreign exchange reserves, the IMF, other international financial institutions and the US were pressuring the government to make some commitments on the country’s nukes and its strategic partnership with China.

3,Ramazan likely to begin on March 23,"The moon is likely to be sighted on Wednesday, March 22, which corresponds to the 29th of Shaban","There are good chances of the moon being sighted for the holy month of Ramazan on Wednesday, March 22, which corresponds to the 29th of Shaban, hence the first day of fasting is likely to be on March 23.
Professor Dr Shahid Qureshi, a well-known astronomical scientist and former chairman of the Department of Astrophysics and Planetary Science of the University of Karachi, told Express News that this year the 'birth' of the Ramazan moon will take place on the night of March 21 at 11:13 pm and will be sighted on the evening of March 22, when the sunset in Karachi will be at 6:43 pm.
He said that at the same time, the crescent moon will remain on the horizon for 47 minutes and will set at 7:30 pm.
It should be remembered that at the time of sunset, the age of the crescent will be 19 hours and 30 minutes, during which the crescent will be 10 degrees above the horizon and about 0.9 percent of the moon will be illuminated, while the distance of the moon from the earth is only 382,000 kilometers.
According to Dr Qureshi, in the light of this data, it will be easy to see the crescent from the southern regions of the country, including Karachi and Gwadar, in the evening of March 22 with binoculars, but it will be a challenge to see such a crescent with the naked eye.
He also said that if the first fast is observed on March 23, then there is no possibility of seeing the Eid moon on the evening of 29th of Ramazan, but if the first fast is observed on March 24, then the Eid moon will be very visible on the evening of 29th of Ramadan.

4,PTI’s rally will go ahead ‘with or without permission’,Ex-CM believes caretaker setup mishandled the arrest warrant and turned it into a political battle,"PTI recently tried to take out a rally in Lahore but was stopped by the caretaker government twice, however, this time around, the party is determined to proceed with its massive public gathering at the Greater Iqbal Park without or without the authorities’ permission.
Former Punjab governor Omer Sarfraz Cheema, while speaking to The Express Tribune, said that the party had applied for permission in compliance with the court’s orders, however, instead of giving them the permission, the authorities prepared a list of hundreds of workers to arrest.
He said that mass arrests were aimed at instilling fear in the hearts of the public to dent the party’s popularity. He added that they were not aware of any other official communication between their party and the district administration.
Musarrat Jamshed Cheema, another senior party leader, said that they had applied to the Deputy Commissioner’s Office only and would press on with their programme even if permission is denied.
The former ruling party tried to take out a rally twice in recent days, but on both occasions, Section 144 was enforced, placing a blanket ban on any kind of public gathering.
Later, this matter was sent to the Lahore High Court (LHC), which instructed the party to inform the district administration before holding a rally.
Advocate Azhar Siddiqui said that the permission of the district administration is not required in this instance. He said that this is a public rally and could proceed with or without permission. He added that seeking permission was a mere formality..
Former caretaker chief minister Hassan Askari Rizvi said that the matter would bring forth the partiality of the caretaker setup. He said that the caretaker government mishandled the arrest warrant and turned it into a political battle.
He further said that the role of the caretaker setup should be confined to holding free and fair elections and running the affairs of the province.

5,"PTI to move SC against K-P governor, ECP",Jhagra says polls date hasn't been announced despite top court directives,"The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has announced it will file a contempt of court petition in the Supreme Court (SC) on Monday against the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) governor and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for not announcing the date of elections in the province.
Sixty-two days have passed since the K-P Assembly was dissolved, but the date of election has not been announced as yet. The apex court had also ordered the governor to give the date for polls in the province.
PTI's former provincial minister Taimur Saleem Jhagra said in his video message that 62 days have passed since the K-P Assembly was dissolved, but the governor has not yet given a date for the assembly elections.
He said that the election cannot be stopped by anyone's will.
Having an election and forming an elected government of the people is the foundation of the constitution, democracy and federalism, he noted.
The decision of the top court is there, but neither the governor is giving the date of election nor is the electoral body issuing the election schedule, he added.
The PTI leader said that elections cannot be stopped on the basis of census, economic situation, or under the notion of holding them together with the National Assembly (NA) polls.
It is dangerous for Pakistan to use delays to stop elections, he warned, adding that if the election date is not announced, the party will file a contempt of court petition against the governor and ECP in the apex court on Monday.

6,Crackdown against PTI intensifies,"Police arrest dozens of supporters of Imran Khan, carry out raids and register FIR for violating Section 144"," 
Police have arrested dozens of supporters and aides of former premier Imran Khan in raids in two cities as part of a crackdown on those involved in recent clashes with the security forces, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and police said on Monday.
Supporters of Imran-led PTI clashed with police in the city of Lahore last week as they attempted to arrest him at his home, and later with police in Islamabad as he arrived to appear appear before a court on Saturday.

""Around 285 PTI supporters have been arrested in Lahore and Islamabad. Houses of all major leaders were raided by police last night,"" Imran’s aide, Fawad Chaudhry, told Reuters.
The former premier is facing several legal cases, including one that prompted a failed attempt to arrest him on Tuesday after a court issued warrants for his arrest for not appearing before it. Clashes between his supporters and the security forces have brought a new round of political chaos to Pakistan, which is in the midst of a crippling economic crisis.
Police in both Lahore and Islamabad confirmed the raids and the arrest of PTI workers they said were involved in clashes with police and arson. ""Police are raiding the houses because seven cases on various charges, including terrorism, have been registered against the leaders and workers,"" Lahore police chief Bilal Kamiana said referring to the clashes with police.

7,Imran must appear today if he wants relief: LHC,PTI chief seeks bail in two terrorism cases filed against him," 
The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Monday made it clear that if PTI Chairman Imran Khan seeks relief in terrorism cases filed against him, he must appear in court on Tuesday (today).
A division bench, headed by Justice Syed Shahbaz Ali Rizvi, took up the former prime minister’s plea seeking protective bail in two terrorism cases registered against him in Islamabad following clashes at the Federal Judicial Complex (FJC) on Saturday.
The first information reports (FIRs) registered at the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) and the Golra Sharif police station stated that the PTI chief and party workers attacked the police and created unrest outside the FJC during the hearing of the Toshakhana case.
As proceedings commenced, Justice Rizvi asked Imran’s counsel, Barrister Salman Safdar, to confirm whether these were the petitioner’s signatures or scanned ones. The counsel argued that these signatures were scanned and of the petitioner.
The counsel argued that two recent FIRs were registered against Imran and others as they reached Islamabad to attend the proceedings in a separate case.
Justice Rizvi remarked, “Where is the petitioner?”
The counsel replied he was not present but would appear by March 21 (Tuesday) and the case proceedings be adjourned.
The counsel said Imran was currently residing at his Zaman Park residence which was “surrounded by police to effect the unlawful arrest”. It was the petitioner’s fundamental right that he be allowed to approach and personally appear before this court and a strict direction be issued to authorities to enable the petitioner to approach “without any mischief by the police”.
Justice Rizvi remarked that if the petitioner wanted relief from the court he must be here in time (2:15pm), adding that any argument about the petitioner’s coming or just reaching the court would not be entertained.
Meanwhile, the division bench granted protective bails to PTI leaders Shah Mahmood Qureshi in two FIRs and Azam Swati in one till March 27. The FIRs were registered against them under different charges, including Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act.
Separately, Islamabad District and Sessions Judge Zafar Iqbal has again summoned Imran on March 30 in the Toshakhana case. The court will hear arguments on the maintainability of the Election Commission of Pakistan complaint. However, the controversy regarding missing order sheet was resolved by the judge himself.
On Saturday, as it was impossible for Imran to enter the courtroom at the FJC due heavy tear-gas shelling, the judge had sent Islamabad Superintendent of Police Muhammad Sami Malik with Barrister Gohar to take  Imran's signature.
“I accompanied the counsel for taking Imran’s signature but when I reached near his vehicle, Barrister Gohar Khan went ahead for taking the signature. [There was] heavy shelling of tear gas and stone pelting and I do not know about the missing order sheet,” a statement submitted by the SP in court said.
However, Barrister Gohar said in a statement: “I got the signature of the accused on the gate of court premises when he was sitting in his vehicle and was unable to reach the courtroom due to heavy shelling of tear gas. There is no justification for concealing/missing of the order sheet by me and I handed it over to Dr Muhammad Sami Malik, SP Islamabad Police.”
An order signed by Judge Iqbal stated, “Muhammad Ashraf, APS, is stating that the missing page of the order sheet is saved in the computer of the court, hence, for resolution of controversy, the missing order sheet is reconstructed.”

8,Maryam terms PTI workers trained terrorists,Says they were recruited from banned organisations supported by Imran,"Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Senior Vice President Maryam Nawaz has termed the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf workers “trained terrorists who were recruited from banned organisations”, urging people to watch the pictures and videos of the Zaman Park operation, which she tweeted.
In several tweets, Maryam shared pictures and videos of the clash between the PTI workers and the police outside Zaman Park, saying: “Watch them carefully! The truth is hard to hide.”
She said that all these were not political activists, “they are trained terrorists who were recruited here from the banned organisations, which Imran Khan has always supported”.
Maryam said, “The evidence speaks for itself, the government must act on it before it is too late.”
Separately, addressing a news conference in Lahore, Federal Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb in an attempt to make the judiciary go against the former PM, said the courts inaction against Imran for challenging the writ of the government was putting the state in danger of anarchy and chaos.
The minister said the police were attacked by the PTI workers for merely executing the court orders, and if the writ of police was allowed by the courts to erode then even the judiciary will not be safe from gangsters and terrorists.
Warning the courts, she said if they think that by protecting their blue-eyed boy, this chaos would stop here, “they are badly mistaken” as others will follow suit.
Imran, she said, was dividing the country, as by pitting the provincial police against each other, he attacked the state with his terrorists and gangsters, he murdered the writ of the state and instead of taking any suo moto action against him, he got a relief package.
She said, “The courts where bails are cancelled for arriving a little late and the courts which gave titles to former prime minister Nawaz Sharif of being a godfather, Sicilian mafia and don, despite him honouring them by attending hearings, allowed Imran, whose workers attacked the police in Lahore with weapons, batons, and stone as well as burnt police vehicles, to get off scot-free.
Mentioning that Imran’s attendance was marked in his car by the registrar, Marriyum asked, “Do courts accord this kind of white-gloved treatment to a terrorist.”
She said judiciary, parliament and government combined make up a state, and it was binding on all to ensure the supremacy of law. “Not doing so will be akin to handing over the country to terrorist.”
