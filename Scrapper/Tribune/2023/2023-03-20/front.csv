0,Govt enhances petrol subsidy to Rs100 per litre,Dr Musadik Malik says small vehicles owners will get 21 litres petrol on low rate in a month,"The government enhanced the petrol subsidy for the low-income population to Rs100, while more measures would also be announced to protect the poor from impact of the soaring inflation, according to a senior government official on Monday.
Minister of State for Petroleum Dr Musadik Malik said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had ordered for the implementation of the petrol relief scheme within six weeks, adding that a mechanism to ensure transparency in the relief package would be finalised.
Dr Malik addressed a press conference a day after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, while chairing a high-level meeting in Lahore, announced the provision of petrol subsidy to the owners of the small vehicles.
The prime minister announced that the low-income individuals would receive a petrol subsidy of up to Rs50 per litre. He directed that the relief would be given to low-income consumers, who have motorcycles, rickshaws, 800 cc cars and other small vehicles.

“On the directions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, subsidy on petrol prices, under the petrol relief scheme, has been enhanced to Rs100 from [previously announced] Rs50 for the poor on every litre of petrol,” Malik told reproters.
“The prime minister has ordered for implementing the petrol relief scheme within six weeks,” the minister of state said, adding that no additional subsidy would be given from the government exchequer.
Explaining the salient features of the scheme, Malik said that a low-income person needed around 21 litters of petrol per month. With that in view, subsidy would be given to the vehicle owner on 21 litres of petrol in a month.
“For cheap petrol, a message will be sent. Motorcycles will not be given more than 2 or 3 litres of petrol in one go,” he said. “The poor will be given a relief of Rs100 on every litre of petrol,” he added.
According to the minister, those who could afford the petrol or those from the upper class would be charged higher prices of petrol and from that amount, subsidy would be provided to the poor.
He highlighted several other pro-poor measures announced by the government. “We have separated the gas tariff for the poor and for the rich. Today the poor pays one-fourth of the bill paid by the rich.
The minister also mentioned the scheme of free flour for the poor people in Punjab during the holy month of Ramazan. “After a few weeks, the government will also bring a third programme for the poor, he added.
“As long as we [the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)] are in the government, our policies will continue, which are to tax the rich and make life easier for the poor,” Dr Malik told the presser.
He criticised former prime minister and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan, who he alleged, considered himself above the law and the Constitution, resisted the court orders with the help of a violent mob and challenged the writ of the state.
The minister lamented that there existed two countries within the country, one for the rich and the other for the poor and “we stand with the country of the poor”. “There are 220 million people in this country out of which 210 million people are poor,” he said.
However, he added: “We also respect the rich, but they will have to give more money. The affluent households which could afford have the right to use luxury items, those who are rich, use luxury goods, use expensive cars, they will pay the real price.”
Responding to a question, the minister of state said that the gas circular debt of Rs1,700 billion had been eliminated. He also said that the government was working on the availability of the liquefied natural gas (LNG).
When asked about the import of oil from Russia, Malik said that he did not say that the oil import would begin in the month of March. “I had said that we will place the order in April,” he clarified. We are still negotiating for buying oil from Russia.”

Asked further about the purchase of Iranian oil, the minister of state replied that he had no objection to Iran oil or any other oil at lower price that came without threat of sanctions. He stressed that the government would take its own decisions.
Dr Malik said that it was for the first time that the government publicised the record of Toshakhana gifts, adding that the cabinet had also decided that full market value of the gifts would be paid if anyone wanted to take gifts from Toshakhana.
Responding to yet another question, he said the alleged audio leak of a former chief justice of Pakistan should be investigated and if found real, cases should be registered against the accused.

1,China touts Saudi-Iran deal as new hope for ME peace,Senior diplomat says pact likely to have trickle-down effect as most conflicts are intertwined,"The Chinese-brokered diplomatic deal between the two major Middle East powers — Iran and Saudi Arabia —has breathed new life into the hopes for the resolution of regional conflicts, while registering China as the leading conciliator on the global stage.
Wang Di, the director-general at the Department of West Asian and North African Affairs in the Chinese Foreign Ministry told a recent media briefing that the Saudi-Iranian rapprochement was “the major good news”.
“I have read that Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) once said that we need to seek the truth no matter how far it lies ... And now I think we can say that in pursuit of peace, we can look to China,” Wang said, sharing the details of the ‘seismic’ deal.
The Wang’s statement came as a number of countries in the region, including Pakistan, welcomed Iran and Saudi Arabia’s move to re-establish their diplomatic relations under Chinese auspices after a seven-year gap.
The two regional heavyweights announced the Chinese-brokered deal on March 10 to restore ties which were severed after Iranian protesters attacked Saudi diplomatic missions in 2016 following the Saudi execution of cleric Nimr al-Nimr.
Under the deal Iran and Saudi Arabia would reopen their embassies and missions within two months and implement security and economic cooperation deals signed more than 20 years ago.
Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said on Sunday that the two countries had agreed to hold a meeting between their top diplomats, while President Ebrahim Raisi also received an invitation from King Salman to visit the kingdom.
The deal is being seen as a historic strategic agreement, reflecting major changes on the world stage that could potentially change the face of regional politics – long considered to be the doing of the US, the architect of major geopolitical configurations.
Commenting on the reactions pouring in from around the world, Wang noted that “the major good news” had come as a sigh of relief for the people long bearing the brunt of regional chaos and tensions.
He added that the détente could only be realised due to the genuine willingness on the part of countries concerned. He acknowledged that all countries, regardless of their geopolitical locations, have hailed the development in unison.
“We saw a genuine smile on Pakistan’s foreign minister’s [Bilawal Bhutto Zardari] face while he was welcoming the agreement,” he added, referring to Pakistan’s positive reaction to the news.
‘No selfish interests’
The remedying of the long-festering rifts has laid out a pattern for other countries to follow the suit and also hammer out peace agreements through dialogue “because many hostilities in the region are intertwined”.
While highlighting China’s emergence as a reliable mediator, Wang dismissed the notion that selfish geopolitical interests underpinned Beijing’s ambitions. “We do not seek any selfish interests or aim to fulfil the so-called vacuum.”
However, in response to a question, Wang underscored an important caveat: although the resumption of diplomatic ties had opened up many doors and Beijing was willing to play a constructive role, it was not a skeleton key for all problems in a world.
“Make no mistake. One dialogue cannot solve all problems. We have noted that the sides have expressed their willingness to improve their relations through dialogue and consultation,” he reminded.
In the same breath, however, he reiterated that the success of the Beijing dialogue was a milestone as it sought to calm the turbulent waters of the region mired in conflicts. “Both sides are willing to work step by step as not all problems will see resolution overnight.”
“It fully illustrates that no matter how complex the problems and how acute the challenges are, as long as the dialogue is conducted on an equal footing, in the spirit of mutual respect, a mutually acceptable solution can surely be found,” he remarked.
“The dialogue sets an example for countries in the Middle East to resolve conflicts and differences and achieve good neighbourliness through dialogue and consultation. It also provides a major piece of good news for the current turbulent world,” he reiterated.
In response to another question, Wang explained that the dialogue was also a success due to China’s support for it and hoped that the agreement would sustain despite the fact that hostilities between the two nations were rooted in history.
“It is always based on the willingness of the countries, instead of lecturing others,” Wang clarified, emphasising that China was always willing to make efforts but did not interfere. “We have played our role, set a pattern for them.”
Asked whether the deal would have an impact on the global energy supply chain as well, Wang said that since both countries were resource-rich and were located at strategically important lands, the resumption of diplomatic would also help the global energy supply.
Explaining why the US was unable to end the hostility, Wang said that the question should be put to the US itself. However, he emphasised that China established itself as a reliable mediator. “Saudi Arabia should be asked as to why they trusted China.”
Since the deal brokered, a flurry of diplomatic activity took place between Iran – which is strongly at odds with Western governments over its nuclear activities – and the Arab countries on the other side of the Persian Gulf.
In Tehran, Mohammad Jamshidi, the Iranian president’s deputy chief of staff for political affairs said in a tweet that President Ebrahim Raisi “has favourably received an invitation” from Saudi Arabia’s King to visit the kingdom.
“In a letter to President Raisi... the King of Saudi Arabia welcomed the deal between the two brotherly countries (and) invited him to Riyadh,” he tweeted, adding that “Raisi welcomed the invitation”.
Foreign Minister Amir-Abdollahian told reporters that the two countries had agreed to hold a meeting between their top diplomats, adding that three locations for the talks had been suggested, without specifying which.
Also a top Iranian security official, Ali Shamkhani, held talks with United Arab Emirates (UAE) President Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Abu Dhabi on Thursday in yet another sign of the shifting relations in the region.

2,Imran tells ECP to de-notify him from NA-45,PTI chief earlier informed commission he participated in by-poll to demonstrate his party’s countrywide support,"To avert the question about his eligibility or for some other reason, PTI chairman and deposed prime minister Imran Khan has informed the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to de-notify him as the MNA from the NA-45 Kurram-I constituency wherein he was notified as the returned candidate in by-election held in the month of October last year.
“We reiterate that our client shall not be taking oath as a member of the National Assembly with respect to NA-45, Kurram-I,” read a letter sent by Imran's counsel Salman Akram Raja to the ECP.
The PTI chief's letter written to the commission also stated that it must de-notify him as the returned candidate from the tribal constituency forthwith.
Imran, in his earlier letter dated February 20, had written that he had participated in the by-poll to demonstrate that the PTI had an overwhelming support of the people in all parts of the country.
He added that the PTI was the only true federal political party.
“The term of the present National Assembly is to expire on 18.08.2023. The fact that the notification dated 19.01.2023 was issued with a delay of over three months after the conduct of [the] by-election in October 2022 reflects malice. The fact that fresh general elections for the National Assembly are necessary [has] been established by the success of the undersigned in the by-elections,” he continued.
Imran's legal team, led by Raja, has also submitted these letters to the Islamabad High Court, which is hearing a petition seeking the disqualification of the PTI chief over concealing his alleged daughter, Tyrian Jade White, in his nomination papers.
Likewise, Imran has also filed a reply with the IHC, wherein it was stated that an MNA-elect did not hold a public office and, therefore, no petition under Article 199 could be maintained against him.
“In any case, the answering respondent [Imran] is not even an MNA-elect after having intimated to the ECP of his intention not to make oath with respect to NA-45 (Kurram-I). The inaction on the part of the ECP is collusive and cannot be held against the answering respondent. The ECP is under an obligation to act forthwith and announce a date for the by-election for NA-45,” the reply read.

3,Imran accuses PDM of 'pitting PTI against army',Former premier claims ‘unknown men’ were stationed outside FJC to assassinate him; asks CJP to take notice,"PTI chief Imran Khan has accused the ruling Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) coalition of trying to drive a wedge between his party and the armed forces, saying that the government was attempting to turn military against the former ruling party.
The former premier’s remarks came during a press conference via video link in the wake of a country-wide crackdown on his party workers who recently clashed with the police during a heated stand-off and protests at the Federal Judicial Complex (FJC).
Imran also claimed that his court appearance in the Toshakhana case had been devised as a trap to bring him into the crosshairs of the same people who took an aim at his life in Wazirabad.
He alleged that ‘unknown’ people were stationed inside the complex who would have killed him had he not left the place on the advice of his companions, and questioned why the people in plain clothes were allowed inside the complex.
He called on Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial to take notice.
“It was a trap and their presence there only meant to assassinate me; on this occasion, our lawyers were also subjected to torture inside the judicial complex,” he said, adding that the manner in which police resorted to teargas shelling and throwing stones at his convoy, he feared that the ‘unknown’ people would have killed him.
He also pleaded with the CJP to hold hearings of all the cases against him through video link, saying there was a threat to his life and he was deliberately being lured to the courts to expose him in the open and subsequently assassinate him.
The PTI chief also asked the CJP if there was any surety for his security. ""Tell me who was there to protect me when I entered the judicial complex, as the three to four guards protecting me would have easily been pushed away”.
He also urged the top judge to take notice of what was happening in the country as democracy and the Constitution were being attacked and nobody seemed to care about it.
Continuing on the judicial complex incident, Imran said that they were collecting evidence and the proof would be sent to the United Nations Human Rights Council and the European Union. He also urged overseas Pakistanis to apprise the international community of how the human rights of his party workers were being violated by the incumbent government.
The PTI chief also took a dig at the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), saying that his opponents would not win elections at any cost, adding that seeing election results, their aim was to now kill him. He also accused them of creating polarisation in society by calling his party workers terrorists, saying such allegations will spread hatred and divide the nation.
He further accused the coalition rulers of making efforts to create a rift between PTI and the armed forces; they were trying their best to provoke the military against the PTI by highlighting campaigns on social media, but no one could control public reaction on social media. He added that “this country was mine and the armed forces were also mine”.
He further claimed that these people were not interested in holding elections; even if I was sent to jail, these people would assassinate me there as well. “They were resorting to brutality against him and his party to protect their interests. The country’s history did not witness such brutality as it did in the tenure of this government,” he added.
Referring to alleged difficulties in running election campaigns in Punjab, he accused the government of spoiling peace in the province and thus creating hurdles to delay the elections despite its date drawing near. “The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had already announced the schedule for polls in the province, which were to be held on April 30,” he said, adding that the authorities were reluctant to allow them to hold a public rally at Minar-e-Pakistan.
Turning his guns towards Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Senior Vice President Maryam Nawaz, Khan said the ‘queen of liars’ thinks as if Pakistan was her fiefdom. “She says that her father (former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif) was Nelson Mandela and he should be forgiven,” he added.
The former premier also castigated caretaker Punjab Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi, saying they came to power just to ruin the PTI and questioned how he became a millionaire in a short period.
He also castigated Finance Minister Ishaq Dar for saying that the country’s missile programme could not be harmed.
“I think the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was now talking about our nuclear programme. I had warned earlier that if our economy continues to deteriorate, it would compromise our national security and sovereignty since they all were interlinked. Hence, conduct free and transparent elections and the economy would revive automatically,” he added.
He urged his supporters not to take up arms, as the party did not want anarchy but elections in the country.

4,"'Separate elections unconstitutional': Govt trying for same-day vote, says Sana","Interior minister says govt is trying for same-day vote, but will follow decision of Supreme Court and ECP","Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah has claimed that the upcoming polls in two provinces – Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa – would be unconstitutional as they would lead to the next general elections not being held under caretaker setups in these provinces.
Addressing a press conference at his residence here on Sunday, the minister said that the government wanted general elections for the National Assembly as well as all the provincial assemblies to be held on the same day under their respective caretaker setups.
“[Constitutionally], caretaker setup is required for the provincial and the National Assembly elections. No one will accept the results of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa [if held under political governments later this year],” the interior minister said. 
“This will increase uncertainty in the country. Is that what you want?” he continued, referring to demands by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan calling for elections in the two provinces. 
""We want elections to be held across the country simultaneously,” the minister said, adding: “Whenever the elections are held, the nation will reject you [PTI] with the power of the vote.”
Rana Sanaullah, however, emphasised that the government would follow the decision of the Supreme Court and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) regarding the elections.
Referring to Saturday’s situation at the Judicial Complex in Islamabad during the hearing of cases against Imran, the interior minister accused the PTI chief of attacking the courts with his armed activists.

“This was hooliganism. If this tradition is allowed to continue, any person will go to the courts with armed groups and trample the law,” he said.
“If Imran’s attendance was to be marked outside the court, it could have easily been done on Canal Road or Toll Plaza,” he remarked.
In further criticism of the PTI chairman, Sana said that Imran was constantly trying to mislead the nation with his “lies”. He alleged that Imran was promoting a culture of incivility in politics, as he “does nothing but blame his political opponents”.
The minister regretted that Imran uttered foul remarks about Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Chief Organiser Maryam Nawaz, who, he claimed, was “boldly exposing his [Imran's] agenda and false allegations to mislead the masses”.
“She will continue to expose PTI's ugly face. Imran should tell the people where are those who incurred Rs50 billion loss to the national kitty. Tell the people where Farah Gogi is,” he said.
He said that that the signing of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreement by Imran Khan and then its violation by his government was a deep-rooted conspiracy to destabilise Pakistan, which would be foiled with the support of the people.
He clarified that, despite having valid search warrants, the police did not enter the family area of Imran's Lahore residence. He alo claimed that a senior police officer was manhandled as he was on official duty to comply with the court orders.
He added that illegal weapons and petrol bombs had been seized and miscreants arrested from Zaman Park. “Imran Khan would have to answer why he had kept 100 armed terrorists at his residence,” he said.
