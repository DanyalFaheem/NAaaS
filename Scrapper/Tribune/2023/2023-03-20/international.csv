0,Sindh set to become Georgia’s sister province,US state passes resolution moved by Pakistan-origin lawmaker,"The US State of Georgia and Pakistan's Sindh province are set to establish sister state-province relations under a resolution passed by Georgia's legislature.
The resolution, introduced by State Representative Farooq Mughal, a Democratic party leader of Pakistan origin, states that ""a sister-state relationship between the State of Georgia and the Province of Sindh would promote mutual trade and commerce and increase the potential for educational, environmental, and cultural relations between the Province of Sindh and the State of Georgia,"" according to a press release issued by the Pakistani embassy.
Pakistan's Ambassador to the US, Masood Khan, Saturday called Representative Mughal to felicitate him on introducing the resolution and said that his efforts have made the entire Pak-American community proud. Terming the resolution 'a historic step', he said that the it would be instrumental in forging strong and close relationships between the two sides and would help project soft power of Pakistan and the United States.
""The resolution provides a framework and a strong foundation for pursuing mutually-beneficial partnerships, both in public and private domains, in critical areas of trade, investment, education, environment, culture and people-to-people exchanges,"" the Pakistani envoy said.
During his telephonic conversation, he said that the sister-province relations resolution would open up vistas of opportunities of cooperation between Pakistan and the United States in diverse areas.
Mughal said that he was working closely with the business community, industry and academia to forge strong partnerships between the two sides.
He said that he would soon be extending an invitation to the political and business leadership of Georgia to visit Pakistan to gain first-hand knowledge and explore business opportunities in the country.
Georgia is the 24th-largest in area and 8th most populous of the 50 United States. Inhabited by a population of around 11 million with a GDP of $580 billion, Georgia's trailing five-year GDP growth is ranked as 14th in the United States. Sindh province, on the other hand, is the second largest economy of Pakistan with a strong industrial base, coastal access and a highly diversified economy.
Representative Mughal represents the citizens of District 105, which includes portions of Gwinnett County. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 2022 and currently serves on the Special Rules, Judiciary Non-Civil and State Planning & Community Affairs committees.

1,From cell phone photos to shooting Pasoori,Ahsan Raza’s journey has made him one of Pakistan’s most sought after cinematographers,"Ahsan Raza always had a fascination for dizzying visuals. But not even in his wildest dreams had he thought about shooting one of the world’s most popular music videos when he started as an amateur photographer while a teenager in Karachi.
It has been a long and challenging journey for Ahsan, who turns 29 this year. He already has major music videos and ads under his belt. His crowning glory remains the music video of Ali Sethi and Shae Gill’s Pasoori for Coke Studio, which has won a variety of accolades, including being the most searched song on Google last year. Over the years, he has worked on some of the biggest projects and with the biggest stars.
It all started with a Nokia 6300, a gift on his seventeenth birthday. Primitive by today’s standard, the phone offered several features and Ahsan experimented with depth of field, soft focus, contrast and other cinematic options.
While he dabbled in photography, including on his cousin’s DSLR, his first love remained music videos. “I would shoot random videos and upload them on my Facebook,” says Ahsan. “In that, I would experiment with camera angles and realized the impact of lighting.”
Alongside this, he also wrote to photographers and videographers he found on social media. One of those was Zain Haleem, one of Pakistan’s leading cinematographers. After months of effort and pleading, Haleem agreed to take him on as an assistant in 2015.
This was Ahsan’s first foray into the professional world, while still a student in the media sciences department at Iqra University. An unpaid hanger-on at the start, he quickly became the first to arrive at locations and the last to leave. He would spend days at the office during shoots - sometimes not going home for entire weeks.
A few months on, Ahsan became Zain’s go-to man. “I was responsible for nearly everything from managing the camera and light teams to preparing the shoot frames as required by the DOP.”
His first major shoot was the Pakistan Super League anthem by Ali Zafar in 2016. Then came the 45-day shoot of Teefa in Trouble, where Ahsan officially served as second DoP to Aleem.
“The film had a lot of fighting and shooting sequences. I realized the importance of body strength, reflexes in handling camera,” says Ahsan. “I saw a distinct improvement in my work over the 45-day stretch.”
It was not easy, notes Ahsan. While my friends were having a blast, I would be spending hours preparing for the shoot. “You need to do the homework, reconnaissance, followed by research, including how the camera angles and lights would appear on those visuals. It’s a painstaking process that involves trial and error.”
But it also has its benefits with Ahsan having more than 300 projects under his belt by now.
 
It included one of the most popular music projects in the country, including Coke Studio, with Ahsan working with some of the biggest names in the industry from Abida Parveen to Zeeshan Parwez.
“We have been in both tight budget and lavish setups and in all cases, Ahsan gets the best out of every shot that I would have in my head. Details matter to him so he takes into account composition, the whole movie as is in the director’s head and tries to decipher the output in the most beautiful way possible,” says Parwez, who has worked with Ahsan on multiple projects.
On the advertisement side, he has work with leading ad makers including Murtaza Chaudhry, with their ad on a fertilizer brand lauded for capturing the rustic beauty of the Punjab and its agricultural land.
Pasoori
Coke Studio remains Ahsan’s most memorable project to date. It took nearly six months of brainstorming and back and forth to get the visuals, the lighting and the photography right. The actual video was shot in an arduous 20-hour spell that ‘felt like a breeze because of the song’s vibe’, says Ahsan.
He says his Instagram was flooded with congratulatory messages from around the world, including a lot of love from India, over the music video.
“When you see someone putting so much of honest thought and energy into contributing to collaborative work, you somehow feel it’s going to make a difference,” says Zulfiqar “Xulfi” Jabbar Khan, who led the Coke Studio project last year. Ahsan has a simple mantra to whet his appetite for excellence: You need to step out of your comfort zone. There are no shortcuts.

2,Looming crisis : Groundwater extraction a threat to buildings,Water bores and tube-wells have become the norm since major supply projects have not been built,"Despite the port city having a water crisis for more than a decade now, the Sindh government has failed to complete major water supply projects, resulting in the city’s populace exploiting Karachi’s groundwater with impunity.
Since the two mega projects, K-IV and 65 MGD, have been delayed multiple times over one pretext or another, residents and industrialists of Karachi alike have resorted to digging bores or installing tube-wells for their daily water needs. Consequently, groundwater which was available at a depth of 50 to 100 feet a couple of decades ago, is now barely available even at a depth of 300 to 350 feet.
While Karachi’s rapidly depleting groundwater reserves might seem like a non-issue to most, geological experts think otherwise. “The way groundwater extraction works the world over is that when you increase your reliance on groundwater, you also invest in replenishing it by making storm drains, which store rain water,” explained Saeed Khawar, a geological expert based in the city. “However, what we are seeing in Karachi is that the city is becoming a concrete jungle, with no storm drains and an increasing dependence on groundwater.”
Khawar termed this dependence a recipe for disaster, adding that rampant groundwater extraction is creating underground voids, which in turn is causing the ground to settle. “This puts the foundations of the buildings in Karachi at risk, especially if there is an earthquake because the ground has settled and now buildings have weaker foundations.”
To avoid such a catastrophe, the expert suggested the city should invest in a rain harvesting system to store rainwater as it would not only increase groundwater levels but also strengthen the soil structure.
However, when asked about implementing Khawar’s suggestion, an official of the Karachi Water & Sewerage Board, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The Express Tribune, that it could not even monitor the groundwater reserves, let alone implement sustainable solutions. “There are major loopholes in our rules, which are exploited by anyone and everyone. Essentially, all the board does is issue no-objection certificates (NOCs) for installation of tube-wells,” the official regretted.
The NOCs that the official mentioned are mostly granted to private companies or industries, which have installed tube-wells along the Lyari River, from where water is supplied to the Sindh Industrial Trading Estates (SITE) by laying underground lines. As per the Water Board’s rules, it is only authorised to monitor these companies’ lines to ensure that no water is being stolen from its’ own supply line - meaning that it cannot take actions against illegal water bores.
Since the water board cannot do much to prevent groundwater extraction, Dr Erum Bashir, a professor at the Geology Department of the University of Karachi, feels that the Board is aiding a much bigger problem. “For instance, the rampant groundwater extraction along the Lyari River is risking damage to the foundations of Lyari Expressway. Similarly, the water bores in residential areas, apart from lowering the water table, are affecting the ecological system and cracking underground structures of buildings,” informed Dr Bashir.
Regional planner, Dr Syed Nawaz-ul-Huda, concurring with Dr Bashir, reiterated Khawar’s suggestions. “The government should build dams around the city; invest in a rain harvesting system within the city; and allow a certain amount of rainwater to move to the sea so that the mangrove forests can be maintained.”
A spokesperson of the Water Board, when asked about implementing the solutions and the department’s disinterest in curtailing groundwater extraction, said that the Sindh government was making a comprehensive policy in this regard. “As soon as they make the policy, the board will start implementing it,” remarked the spokesperson while speaking to The Express Tribune.

3,Terse exchange between leaders at PTI’s Karachi protest,PTI workers were protesting against police action on the Lahore residence of Imran Khan,"Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) senior leader Firdous Shamim Naqvi and its Karachi chapter head Aftab Siddiqui had a terse exchange during a protest by party workers near the Millennium Mall in Gulistane-Jauhar on Sunday.
PTI workers were protesting against police action on the Lahore residence of Imran Khan.
""Unfortunately, leaders of the PTI in Karachi did not bother to come out of their homes to protest,"" said Naqvi while addressing protesters. If anything happens to Imran Khan, you should not wait for the leadership's instructions and come out to protest, he continued.
During Firdous Shamim's speech, PTI's Karachi President, Aftab Siddiqui, seized his microphone, resulting in an angry exchange on stage after which Naqvi left the podium.

4,Rickshaw driver suspected of robbery ‘dies of police torture',Rasheed had taken as passengers men who robbed a cell phone shop,"A rickshaw driver, who spent several days in police custody over suspicion of involvement in a dacoity at a cell phone shop in Defence Phase VIII, died on Sunday, with the family claiming that it was due to the police torture.
They said that Abdul Rasheed was arrested last week, and the police tortured him for four days. The police handed him over on Friday, they said adding that the victim was badly injured.
A resident of Qayyumabad, Rasheed leaves behind a widow and three children. His family said that he had been driving a rickshaw for the last ten years. He hailed from Okara. Rasheed had taken as passengers the men who robbed the cell phone shop in Defence.
The superintendent of police for Investigation said that the rickshaw was seen in the CCTV footage of the incident. He said that he was taken into custody and released after questioning. He claimed that the driver was not tortured while adding that an autopsy would determine the cause of death. Four suspects took the security guard and staff of a cell phone shop in Defence Phase VII hostage at gunpoint on March 12, and looted mobile phones and other valuable items worth more than Rs12.5 million and escaped. The CCTV footage captured them leaving on a rickshaw. A day after the incident, the police traced the rickshaw, detained its driver and released him after questioning.
Rasheed's family said that they went to the Gizri police station to meet him and then to the Darakhshan police station, but the police told them that he wasn't in their custody. The family members said that on Friday night, they received a phone call from the police station to come and take Rasheed home. When they reached the station, they saw Rasheed was badly injured and showed clear signs of physical torture, they said. They took him to JPMC where he underwent a medical examination and tests. The deceased had internal injuries. Doctors prescribed some medicines to Abdul Rasheed and discharged him. Abdul Rasheed died at home on Sunday.
The family members of the deceased have demanded that the officials who tortured Abdul Rasheed be fired and strict legal action be taken against them.

5,Influx of beggars as Ramazan nears,"There are more than 130,000 beggars in Karachi and 300,000 beggars come from other cities every year before Ramazan","Beggars have started pouring in Karachi from the smaller towns and villages of Sindh, south Punjab and other parts of the country as the month of Ramazan is round the corner. They have set up their shanties in different areas of the city.
Charity witnesses a significant increase during Ramazan, including meals for the needy at sunset, the time of breaking the fast.
According to estimates, there are more than 130,000 local beggars in Karachi and 300,000 beggars come from other cities every year before Ramazan.
The numbers have increased further in the wake of inflation and unemployment. There are also criminals among the beggars who come from other cities. As a result, the crime rate goes up by more than 60 per cent during the month of Ramazan. The city already has alarmingly high rate of robberies and street crimes while arrival of beggars along with the criminals poses serious security threat to the Karachiites.
The Sindh government announces crackdown against beggars every year, but practically no action is taken against them. During the Karachi operation, some federal investigative agencies had sent a report that the local police did not have any record of beggars living in the slums and suburbs of Karachi, as well as coastal areas.

9,Tando Jam varsity gets equipment upgrade,"GIS, remote sensing lab set up at Sindh Agriculture University","A Geographical Information System (GIS) and remote sensing lab has been established at the Sindh Agriculture University (SAU), Tando Jam.
Faculty of Agricultural Engineering Dean Prof Dr Altaf Siyal told The Express Tribune that the lab is equipped with 20 workstations with dual monitors and the i7, 8th generation processors of 2.57Ghz.
He expressed hope that the GIS facility will help build the capacity of the faculty members, officials of the Sindh agriculture department, technical staff of different government organisations and other stakeholders.
He added that users will have access to the monitors to map the natural resources of Sindh like forests, water, crops, vegetation and wetlands, among other things.
Prof Siyal said the lab will provide technical assistance in the development of geo-spatial maps of cropping patterns, soil variability, temporal groundwater depth and quality variations in the province.
He said that the lab will also give technical assistance to the government on emergent natural hazards which severely affected the agriculture sector.
The lab, set up at a cost of Rs11.54 million, has been funded by Agriculture Supply and Prices Department of Sindh government. It is also equipped with a 5KV solar system.
According to the dean, he has planned to launch a one-year diploma course in application of GIS and remote sensing in the Faculty of Agricultural Engineering. Besides, the undergraduate and postgraduate, students of the SAU can also avail the facility.
It warrants mention that a smaller GIS lab with only four computers was first established at SAU by Prof Siyal in 2013. But it was closed in less than two years and the computers were distributed among different faculties as Prof Siyal had then joined Mehran University of Engineering and Technology.
At MUET, Prof Siyal set up a bigger lab with 20 dual monitor workstations. When he returned to SAU, he began working on the plan of setting up a similar lab in that agriculture university as well.
