1,University staff body threatens protest,FAPUASA asks UoP to solve genuine demands of protesting employees,"Federation of All Pakistan Universities Academic Staff Association (FAPUASA) has warned of a country-wide strike and protest against the attitude of University of Peshawar (UoP) management.
In a press statement issued on Sunday, FAPUSA said that employees and teachers of UoP have been on a strike against the attitude of university administration and vice chancellor without inviting any attention from the quarters concerned.
“This is for the third time in the past few months that the staffers are protesting but the attitude of the management is unfortunate,” says the statement, adding that all the genuine demands of the university employees and teachers should be accepted.
“Let us make it clear that we stand with the UoP employees and in the event of a prolonged protest and sit-in, FAPUASA will call a general body meeting to decide on province-wide or even country-wide protest,” added the statement.
Protest walk announced
On the other hand the joint action council (JAC) of UoP teachers and other staffers on Sunday announced a protest walk on University Road.
Talking to The Express Tribune officials of JAC said that teachers and staffers of all the universities located inside the UoP campus, known as greater campus, have been invited to participate. They made it clear that their protest will continue till the acceptance of all their demands.
“The protesters are going to march on the administration block of the UoP and the administration of the varsity will be responsible for any untoward incident,” said an official, adding that no pressure will be tolerated in this regard.
It may be mentioned here that teaching and non-teaching staff of the UoP started a protest on March 7 against the killing of a private security supervisor Saqlain Bangash. Bangash was killed inside the university campus when allegedly a guard dropped his gun and it fired hitting the supervisor.

2,Funds awaited: Dengue may surge as govt delays funding,Sources predict a provincial epidemic,"As the government grapples with burgeoning public expenditure amidst a deepening financial crisis, a delay in funding for dengue prevention risks instigating a health crisis.
According to the Dengue Control Manager, Dr. Qasim Afridi, the government has delayed transferring funds worth Rs350 million for the prevention and awareness campaign for dengue.
This comes as a bolt out of the blue for the health authorities who were expecting further assistance from the government following the recent rise in cases of dengue fever.
“Dengue cases usually peak during the months of April and May in K-P, however 10 have already been reported just at the beginning of March,” said a source from the Health Department.
While dengue fever poses a threat to the health and safety of all citizens, those residing in areas like Peshawar, Mardan, Haripur, Khyber and Nowshera face a doubled threat given the topography of the regions where standing bodies of glacial water act as breeding grounds for the larvae of the dengue mosquitos.
Therefore, in case preventative measures are not taken beforehand for eliminating the larvae in these regions, the virus risks spreading into other nearby areas.
As Ali Khan, a local from the Palosai area of Peshawar confirmed, “A majority of the dengue cases reported from K-P originated in our locality. Why does the government not take the matter seriously,” he questioned.
The direness of the situation is evident in the fact that up to 23,000 dengue cases including 18 deaths were reported in K-P last year.
While Dr. Afridi asserts that the healthcare system in K-P is equipped to deal with a dengue epidemic, he still stresses the importance of preventing an outbreak in the first place, since once the disease becomes endemic, it can trigger a crisis beyond the countering capabilities of the hospitals.
Therefore, in order to actualize the preventative goals, the Larva Surveillance campaign had been initiated across the province from January 2023 onwards, with weekly meetings being held involving the Deputy Commissioner and District Health Officer,” said Dr Afridi.
In these campaigns locals were educated on the ways in which dengue can be prevented, especially with regards to the usage of mosquito nets and repellants. On a similar note, fogging and spraying was carried out on a large scale to destroy the larva in stagnant water.
Following the government’s inability to deliver funds on time, the Larva Surveillance Campaign had to utilize last year’s funds worth Rs104 million.
“While our teams are educating the general public to the best of our abilities, the government must realize its duties towards the people and must invest in their well-being by transferring the allocated funds in a timely manner,” concluded Dr Afridi.

4,JI chief backs general elections on same day,Siraj says separate polls in each province is a waste of precious resources,"Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) Central Amir Sirajul Haq on Sunday joined hands with the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), at least on the issue of general elections, and demanded holding of polls on the same day across the country under an independent judiciary, election commission and an impartial establishment.
Addressing an aman jalsa, as part of the tribal rights movement, in the Bara area of Khyber tribal district, Siraj said that the PDM and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) governments were responsible for the prevailing economic crisis and the runaway inflation in the country.
“The establishment creates conflicts among politicians and then different factions begin to fight each other,” he said, adding that these brutal tactics could not be tolerated anymore.
The JI chief demanded that the elections should be held on a single day across the country but impartial establishment was also a must to hold transparent elections.
“There should be an independent judiciary and an independent election commission to make sure that the vote is held in a free and fair manner,” he stressed, adding if this is not the case then elections will be just a waste of time.
Siraj said that there is widespread destruction and despair in the tribal districts but the ruling elite have deviated from the promises made at the time of merger for the development of the tribal areas.
He maintained that the education and health sectors had been destroyed in militancy which needed to be rehabilitated on war footing.
“If we are voted to power, we will provide free education to the people like in the past,” he maintained.
The JI amir shared that if tribal people do not get justice, the courts should be locked.
He alleged that eighteen families of the ruling parties own assets worth Rs4,000 billion which they collected through corruption.
Criticizing Maulana Fazlur Rehman and other PDM leaders, Siraj said that they staged protest against inflation during the PTI government but after getting power, he could not see the current situation of inflation. The JI chief alleged that PTI was in power in the province for the last 9 years but did not develop the province.
He stated that the province had gone bankrupt as corruption increased by the day. He stressed that people should trust the responsible leadership of JI by voting for the party to get the country out of the current economic problems.
