0,High rates to stem outflow,Investors have pulled out of saving schemes to deposit funds in banks,"In search of much-needed financing, the government has increased the rate of profit on national saving schemes up to 4.13 percentage points to offer lucrative investment avenues and finance the widening fiscal deficit.
A research house reported on Friday that the Central Directorate of National Savings (CDNS) increased the rate of return (RoR) by 4.13 percentage points to 17.13% on Special Savings Certificates (SSC) compared to 13% earlier.
It revised the rate up by four percentage points to 18.50% on Savings Account, 3.86 percentage points to 19.82% on Short-term Savings Certificates (STSC), 2.64 percentage points to 16.56% on Behbood Savings Certificates (BSC) and Pensioners Benefit Account (PBA) each.
Besides, it raised the RoR by 2.61 percentage points to 14.87% on Defense Saving Certificates (DSC) and by 0.24 percentage point to 12.84% on Regular Income Certificates (RIC).
A CDNS official told The Express Tribune earlier this week that individual and institutional investors were pulling out investments from the government’s saving schemes.
Lack of revision in the RoR pushed investors to “prematurely” withdraw investments and invest in other lucrative instruments like fixed deposits at banks, he said.
That shift worried the government that had long relied on savings mobilised through the CDNS to finance its fiscal deficit. In turn, it led to an increase in reliance on expensive financing from commercial banks.
The government on Wednesday this week acquired a record high debt of Rs2.25 trillion by selling treasury bills to domestic commercial banks at a historically high return of 22%.
A leading analyst said that Pakistan’s fiscal deficit was projected to spike to Rs5.8 or Rs6 trillion (7% of GDP) in the current fiscal year compared to the initial target of Rs3.7 trillion (4.4% of GDP).
Interest payments on soaring debt constitute the largest government expenditure.
The day the government made the record borrowing from commercial banks, the SBP reported that investors withdrew Rs32.38 billion ($190 million) from saving schemes in February 2023 alone.

1,Baidu sues over fake Ernie bot apps,"Said it lodged lawsuits against Apple, app developers","Chinese search engine giant Baidu, has filed lawsuits against “relevant” app developers and Apple Inc over fake copies of its Ernie bot app available on Apple’s app store.
The company’s artificial intelligence powered Ernie bot, launched last month, has been touted as China’s closest answer to the US-developed chatbot ChatGPT.
Baidu said it had lodged lawsuits in Beijing Haidian People’s Court against the developers behind the counterfeit applications of its Ernie bot and the Apple company.
“At present, Ernie does not have any official app,” Baidu said in a statement late on Friday posted on its official “Baidu AI” WeChat account.
It also posted a photograph of its court filing.
“Until our company’s official announcement, any Ernie app you see from App Store or other stores are fake,” it said.
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A Reuters search on Saturday found there were still at least four apps bearing the Chinese-language name of the Ernie bot, all fake, in Apple’s App Store.
The Ernie bot is only available to users who apply for and receive access codes. In its statement, Baidu also warned against people selling access codes.

2,Industrialists seek early release of goods containers,"In a letter, FPCCI presses central bank to call emergency meeting to find solution","Pressure is mounting on the government to release the containers loaded with industrial raw material and other goods that have been stuck at ports for months and are awaiting clearance.
The Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), in a letter to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), pressed the central bank to convene an emergency meeting to dig out a solution to the lingering issue.
According to contents of the letter, the FPCCI expressed its anxiety over the stuck containers of raw material at ports. “We have never seen this sort of economic situation ever before,” the letter read.
FPCCI Vice President Shabbir Mansha said “the chamber is facing mounting pressure from different trade and industrial quarters. There is a need for taking immediate and effective steps to sort out the matter.”
Mansha mentioned “we informed the SBP about the unavailability of industrial raw material but no action has been taken yet.”
He demanded that foreign currency exchange companies should be allowed to purchase dollars for financing imports, which would enable importers to purchase the greenback from those exchange companies and get their imported goods released from ports.
Furthermore, all payment timeframes for imports should be extended from 180 days to 365 days. And there should be an open account facility for the imported raw material, the letter proposed.
FPCCI suggested that the condition of a banking financial instrument should not be applicable when importers were sourcing dollars for imports and urged the SBP to take urgent steps to address the challenges.

3,Anti-export policy cutting exports: LCCI,Says allegations of exporters hoarding money abroad are entirely false,"The State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) recent implementation of anti-export laws is threatening to cut the country’s exports by at least half of their potential level, warns the Lahore Chamber of Commerce & Industry (LCCI).
In a statement released on Saturday, LCCI President Kashif Anwar noted that the SBP’s allegations that exporters are hoarding money abroad are entirely false and are impacting the policies being formed. The LCCI has called for the withdrawal of the recently issued Circular No. 02 of 2023 on March 31, 2023, regarding the realisation of Export Proceeds.
Exporters from different sectors, including meat, carpet, auto, agriculture, leather, and textile, voiced their concerns over the notification issued by the SBP, led by former LCCI President Shahid Hassan Sheikh.
The LCCI president announced a committee consisting of representatives of different exporting sectors, which will form suggestions and budget proposals for the SBP and other departments related to exports. The LCCI will then take these suggestions to higher levels for expert opinions.
Anwar highlighted the importance of product diversification, shelf life, and other factors in determining the export proceed time. According to the circular, delays in bringing the export proceeds into the country will result in fines ranging from 3% to 9% on realised export proceeds, adversely affecting exporters who are already facing steep and multi-dimensional challenges due to the rise in the cost of doing business. Anwar noted that this measure is completely unjustified as there are often delays in export proceeds due to circumstances beyond exporters’ control, and it will ultimately impact the competitiveness of Pakistan’s exports in the international market. He added that with many of the sectors importing up to 50% raw material, how can they keep money out and still manage imports?
Exporting sectors have their own specific requirements, and it is unfair to have a single notification for value-added sectors, perishable items, and products with long shelf life, said Anwar. He further added that the interest rate of 21% and the businessmen’s confusion about bringing money to the market or keeping it in the bank to earn a profit is also causing challenges.

4,Increase local production of edible oil: experts,Country’s annual import of edible oil stands at a staggering $4 billion,"Pakistan’s agriculture sector is in urgent need of attention from the government to boost the local production of edible oil. The country’s annual import of edible oil stands at a staggering $4 billion, causing a significant drain on the country’s economy.
Experts suggest that the coastal areas of Sindh have high potential for the production of palm, sesame, and canola oils, but it is imperative that the government takes swift action to increase production and reduce reliance on imports.
Former Vice Chairman of Pakistan Vanaspati Manufacturers Association (PVMA), Sheikh Umer Rehan, called for urgent action to increase the production of edible oil and seeds in the country.
Due to the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) decision to curb Letters of Credit (LCs) and the shortage of foreign exchange, the price of edible oil in the country has been steadily rising, making it increasingly difficult for the people to procure the commodity, noted Rehan.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, President of Concave Agri Services Muhammad Ali Iqbal said, “The biggest challenge is the will of the government.”
Iqbal also emphasised the need for standardised approaches for the cultivation of different edible oil plant varieties.
Due to non-standardised approaches, locally cultivated different edible oil plant varieties have not been able to achieve desired results. For example, in Mianwali, Canola is being cultivated significantly now, but the non-approved Canola variety of UAF-11 used by the majority of farmers contains around 20% euric acid, exceeding the maximum limit of euric acid for edible oil, which is less than 5%. This lack of standardisation has resulted in a rise in smuggling due to the hike in prices of edible oil.
“The edible oil industry doesn’t want to a pay fair price to the local farmers, but seems to be willing to pay more to foreign growers,” lamented Iqbal.
President Sindh Chamber of Agriculture Miran Mohammed Shah highlighted that the Southern Divisions of Sindh, including the areas of Hyderabad, Mirpurkhas, and Shaheed Benazirabad, are already making advances in growing oilseed crops. However, local farmers are not getting any support from the government side in the development of these seeds, including incentives like subsidised rates and ensuring the availability and development of such seeds.
According to Senior Vice President of Sindh Abadghar Board (SAB) Mahmood Nawaz Shah, there is a huge opportunity in Pakistan to grow oil seeds with a sustained long-term policy. This policy will include the provision of quality seeds/plants, proper pricing, and extension work so that growers can attain proper yields and return on the crop.
Despite identifying the opportunity to grow oil seeds in Pakistan for more than a decade, there is still a lack of attention from the government in agriculture to develop a long-term sustainable policy, he said.
With the country’s reliance on imports and rising prices of edible oil, urgent action is necessary to boost the local production of edible oil in Pakistan. The potential for the production of palm, sesame, and canola oils in the coastal areas of Sindh can be harnessed with the government’s intervention and support for standardized approaches and the development of quality seeds/plants. A sustained long-term policy is needed to improve the agriculture sector’s production of edible oil in Pakistan.

5,Stocks flat as investors stay on sidelines,"KSE-100 index edges up by 49 points, or 0.12%, at 40,050","Pakistan Stock Exchange opened the week on a negative note and experienced turbulent sessions for most of the week. However, the benchmark KSE-100 index managed to recover partially and closed flat with gains of 49 points.
At the beginning of the week, the market lost ground as many investors preferred to remain on sidelines amid concerns over a further hike in policy rate. On Monday, the index fell below the 40,000 mark.
Cautious investors refrained from building fresh positions on Tuesday as well and awaited the monetary policy announcement and the Supreme Court’s verdict on a Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s (PTI) petition challenging the postponement of elections in Punjab. The KSE-100 index ticked up on Wednesday on clarity after the monetary policy announcement where the central bank jacked up the policy rate by a lower-than-expected 100 basis points (bps).
Positivity returned to the bourse on Thursday as Saudi Arabia committed a financial support of $2 billion, which would help Pakistan secure the much-awaited deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). However, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar cancelled his trip to the United States, where he was supposed to meet the IMF and World Bank officials, which turned things around on Friday.
The news was not well received and resultantly the index came under pressure, dropping over 300 points. The KSE-100 index gained 49 points, or 0.12% week-on-week, and settled at 40,050 at the end of the week.
JS Global analyst Wasil Zaman, in his report, noted that the market remained stable week-on-week closing at 40,050 points despite a prolonged delay in the IMF programme.
There was some clarity on the political front as the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), following orders from the Supreme Court, announced the holding of elections in Punjab on May 14, he said.
Oil and gas sector (+1.2% week-on-week) emerged as the top performer following news of crude production cuts by OPEC+ countries.
Tobacco sector (-11.6% week-on-week), on the other hand, was among the key under-performers.
On the news front, with administrative controls on imports intact, the trade deficit continued to narrow and reached $1.46 billion in March, down 21% month-on-month. Imports declined 5% month-on-month whereas exports improved 8%.
In a bid to control inflation, the State Bank went for further monetary tightening, increasing its policy rate by another 100 bps to 21%. Its foreign currency reserves remained largely stable at $4.24 billion, a marginal decline of $36 million week-on-week.
Oil marketing companies’ sales continued to slide during March 2023, hitting 1.1 million tons, down 9% month-on-month, and cement sales for March showed a similar trend, declining to 3.8 million tons, down 6% month-on-month as a result of economic slowdown, the JS analyst added.
Arif Habib Limited, in its report, said that the market commenced trading on a negative note as participants expected an interest rate hike in the monetary policy.
Furthermore, noise on the political front fuelled the negative momentum. However, the market witnessed a rally after a lower-than-expected jump in policy rate (100bps hike).
Meanwhile, the commitment of funds worth $2 billion from Saudi Arabia gave a boost to the bullish sentiment as bridging the external financing gap was one of the conditions for completing the ninth review of IMF programme.
In terms of sectors, positive contribution to the market came from oil and gas exploration companies (149 points), technology and communication (90 points), power generation and distribution (45 points), fertiliser (41 points) and cement (32 points).
Negative contribution came from auto assemblers (22 points), tobacco (17 points) and commercial banks (14 points).
Foreigners’ buying continued during the week as they bought stocks worth $4.7 million as compared to net buying of $0.15 million last week, the AHL report added.

6,Slow progress stokes worries,Oil refineries waiting for three years for approval of new policy,"Pakistan’s oil refineries have expressed disappointment over slow progress on finalising a new refinery policy, being designed to help execute plant upgrade projects to produce clean fuels and meet growing consumer demand.
“Refineries have been waiting for the past three years for approval of the new policy,” remarked a senior official of a local refinery.
Government officials revealed that the Petroleum Division had sent a draft of the refinery policy to the Cabinet Committee on Energy (CCOE) for review and approval.
However, certain quarters expressed reservations about the policy, which could delay its announcement.
The previous government had approved a new refinery policy but it hit a deadlock over the incremental revenue offered to the refineries investing in plant upgrading projects.
In that political dispensation, a group of politicians, led by Karachi-based ministers, were against approval of the draft refinery policy.
In the draft, the Petroleum Division pointed out that local refineries were meeting 55% of Pakistan’s annual demand for petroleum products, including supplies for defence needs and essential transportation.
According to recent calculations, they make annual foreign exchange savings of more than $1 billion and process about 70,000 barrels of local crude and condensate per day.
They also generate more than 100,000 direct and indirect employment opportunities and make a substantial contribution to the national exchequer and gross domestic product (GDP).
Refineries claim they have eased the burden on Port Qasim and Karachi Port as instead of importing refined petroleum products, they are processing crude oil to produce multiple energy and non-energy products such as petrol, diesel, JP-1, JP-8, kerosene oil, furnace oil, liquefied petroleum gas, lubes, bitumen, wax, etc.
Despite being integral to the growth of economy, no new refinery project has materialised in Pakistan over more than a decade and only two refineries have been established in the past 40 years.
Petroleum Division has proposed a tariff protection of 10% deemed duty on diesel and 2.5% on petrol to help refineries execute upgrading projects to enhance their production capacity for meeting the country’s demand.
It had already been approved in the budget but refineries were not allowed to utilise the duty collection for modernising their plants.
The locally produced and imported crude oil is refined by five refineries, which have been periodically upgraded to comply with latest fuel specifications.
Petroleum Division has been pressing refineries to undertake additional upgrades of their facilities by producing Euro-V standard fuels and curtailing the production of furnace oil.
This, however, entails a capital investment of approximately $4-4.5 billion. In order to procure financing, the refineries will have to improve their balance sheets and resort to commercial borrowing.
Five-year financial statements of the refineries indicate that the industry requires financial support from the government to improve its financial position to be able to carry out the necessary upgrades.
Pakistan is also looking for investment in the oil refining sector from different countries, particularly Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
Saudi Arabia has shown interest in reviving a stalled project and announced the setting up of a refinery during the tenure of previous Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government with an investment of $10 billion.
Industry insiders, however, were concerned that the current situation could potentially discourage investment in the exploration of oil and gas, and cause vulnerabilities in the strategic fuel supply chain. Furthermore, it can also put an additional burden on the balance of payments.
In October 1997, the government had introduced the Petroleum Policy 1997 (amended in 2002), which replaced the minimum 10% guaranteed rate of return for refineries with a tariff protection formula (10% deemed duty on high-speed diesel and 6% on kerosene oil, light diesel oil and JP-4).
However, in 2008, the tariff protection was reduced to 7.5% on high-speed diesel only, which discouraged investment in the establishment of new refineries or plant upgrades.
Subsequently, an energy sub-group of the Planning Commission’s advisory committee was formed, which made recommendations through a letter dated April 14, 2021 for investment in the refining industry with government support, including product pricing policies, tax structures and so on. In light of the situation, the Petroleum Division has prepared the draft of Pakistan Oil Refining Policy for both new and existing refineries.

7,RDA inflows surpass $6b in April,"Investment had dropped to $110m in Jan, but rose to $125m in Feb, $155m in March","Overseas Pakistanis investing through Roshan Digital Accounts (RDA) have surpassed the $6 billion mark in April, according to a local brokerage report.
The data revealed that the gross inflows have improved in recent days, totalling at $194 million in the past 38 days, after the government revised up rate of return on Naya Pakistan Certificates. However, the net inflows are estimated significantly low compared to the gross one as investors are allowed to invest and withdraw investment at any point of time.
Investments had dropped to around a two-year low at $110 million in January, but improved to $125 million in February and have now reached $155 million in March 2023.
The RDA was introduced by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf (PTI) government in September 2020 to help boost the country’s foreign exchange reserves. A large chunk of the RDA investment goes into Naya Pakistan Certificates, which were designed for overseas and resident Pakistanis having declared assets abroad. Out of the total $6 billion, the expatriates have invested a gross $3.65 billion in Naya Pakistan Certificates in the past 32 months.
However, the central government debt profile suggests net investment in Naya Pakistan Certificates stood at a meagre Rs46 billion ($160 million) in February 2023, which was significantly low compared to gross investment at $3.65 billion in 32 months.
The investment in the certificates stood at Rs50 billion ($174 million) in the prior month of January 2023 – showing a month-on-month drop of 7%, according to the data.
The net investment at $160 million in the certificates suggests that a large number of non-resident Pakistanis have withdrawn the investment or did not re-invest at maturity of the investment period.
Analysts said a large number of overseas Pakistanis have gone on sidelines, adopting a wait-and-see strategy since high political temperature has melted down the domestic economy. A large number of factories are lying closed completely or partially, and millions of people have lost jobs. The fast depletion in foreign currency reserves to critically low levels at $4.24 billion has increased the risk of default on foreign debt repayment.
Pakistan is set to repay a total of $4.5 billion in three months (April to June 2023), while foreign inflows have slowed down to next to nil in wait for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to resume its $6.5 billion loan programme.
Despite the challenges, the number of deposit holders in RDA has reached 536,000, with investors injecting $39 million in the first seven days of April and another $155 million in the prior month of March. They have also invested another gross $490 million in stocks of companies listed at the Pakistan Stock Exchange.
In conclusion, despite the current economic challenges, the RDA has proved to be an essential tool in attracting foreign investment from overseas Pakistanis. While there are concerns over net inflows, the gross inflows have surpassed the $6 billion mark, and investors have shown interest in the stock market. The government needs to work on restoring investor confidence and ensuring economic stability to encourage more foreign investment in the country.
