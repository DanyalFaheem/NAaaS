2,Two dams approved for garrison city,Funds have been released for construction of Mujahid and Mohata dams,"Given the acute shortage of water in the garrison city coupled with plummeting groundwater sources, the authorities have approved the construction of two new state-of-the-art dams in the garrison city.
Sources said the Punjab Small Dams Organisation approved the projects for construction of Mujahid and Mohata dams while funds have also been released for construction of these two dams under the Annual Development Programme (ADP).
The source said with the construction of these two dams 350,000 people residing in the suburbs of the Rawalpindi district will get access to clean drinking water while the supply of water from these dams will also help irrigate 13,000 acres of agricultural land.
Both these projects were conceived during the regime of former federal minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan and were later included in the ADP after approval.
Tenders have been issued to award contracts for the construction of both water storage projects.
According to sources, the estimated cost of the Mujahid Dam, which will be constructed in the Chontra region, is Rs937.73 million.
An irrigation system will also be laid along with this dam, which will irrigate 7,000 acres of land in the vast rural area of Chontra, the sources said. Around 150,000 people of Chontra and surrounding areas will get potable water for which water tanks will be built.
The construction of the Mujahid Dam will be finished in 30 months.
On the other hand, the Mohata Dam will be constructed in Raika, the densely populated union council of Rawalpindi District, at an estimated cost of Rs660.23 million and will help irrigate 6,000 acres of agricultural land in the area.
Sources said underwater tanks will be constructed and drinking water pipelines will also be laid in addition to the irrigation system alongside the dam.
The Mohata Dam will be constructed in a record-breaking period of 18 months, the sources claimed.
The two dams will be complemented by amusement parks with fruit and flower plants and thick forest trees grown in the Miyawaki forest style for the delight of the local inhabitants.
Additionally, these two dams will have motorboats for recreation while for the breeding of water birds, different types of fish will also be bred in these dams.
The dams will be built on government land, including their catchment areas. The contract for the construction of these dams will be awarded in the first week of May after the opening of bids on April 29.
Experts say the groundwater level in Rawalpindi has plummeted while the water supply from Rawal and Khanpur dams has been slashed amidst high consumption of the vital commodity. In addition to this, the rapidly growing population, rising temperatures in the summers, and incessant droughts have made the construction of these dams crucial.

3,‘Overburdened’ BBH to get 220 additional beds,"Pindi’s busiest hospital will also get higher budget, doctors, nursing and support staff","In view of an increasing number of patients and limited treatment facilities, the addition of 220 beds has been approved in the Benazir Bhutto General Hospital (BBH) under the upgradation plan.
With doctors, nursing staff, support staff, provision of necessary equipment and an additional budget, the BBH will provide treatment facilities with 968 instead of 748 beds.
After the physical verification of the hospital by a special committee of the Ministry of Health, its upgradation was approved.
According to sources, the upgradation and increase in the number of beds of BBH, the city's busiest and overburdened medical facility, had long been declared inevitable as there was a continuous rush of patients in the emergency, OPD and wards of the hospital.
The hospital was facing an acute shortage of doctors, nursing and support staff, the sources said. “It had become impossible for a patient to get a bed in any ward of the hospital,” they added.
“In addition to the orthopaedic, peads and general surgery departments, the urology department was also giving operation dates to patients with a delay of four to eight months due to which the patients were facing immense difficulties.”
According to the recommendations made for the upgradation and expansion of the hospital, a special team of the federal health ministry conducted physical verification of the hospital building in December 2018 and March 2023 and recommended the addition of 220 more beds to the hospital.
The health ministry’s recommendation was followed by the approval of the Specialised Healthcare and Medical Education Department to increase the number of working beds from 748 to 968 in the BBH.
After its upgradation, the hospital’s emergency department will have 114 beds, peads 295, 92 beds each in general medicine and surgery, 58 in gynaecology, 52 in orthopaedics, 50 in dialysis centre and urology, 32 in ophthalmology, 26 in ENT, 44 in psychiatry, 31 in cardiology, 20 in ICU, 40 in dengue ward, 10 in dermatology while 12 beds will be available to patients in the private ward.
Regarding the upgradation and expansion of BBH, Medical Superintendent Dr Tahir Rizvi told The Express Tribune that increasing the number of beds in the hospital and the number of doctors, nursing and support staff was a long-standing requirement. 
“To solve this problem, Secretary Health Ahmed Javed Qazi has taken a keen interest and practical steps,” he said.
The medical superintendent of BBH said: “Regular working has been started on the requirement of additional budget, doctors, nursing staff and support staff according to the additional 220 beds of the Benazir Bhutto General  Hospital has been started.”
“The case will soon be sent to the health department from where after its approval, it will go to the finance department and after approval, the process of acquiring additional human resources and equipment will be started,” he explained.
Dr Rizvi said the additional 220 beds for the hospital will greatly facilitate the treatment process. 
“The burden will be reduced and the patients will also be able to get convenience,” he said and added that provision of additional doctors, nursing and support staff, will also aid treatment facilities.

According to a spokesperson for the police, the maternal uncle of the victim while levelling the allegations against the squad members told the Pirwadhai police that he was standing in the street with his friends and nephews named Faisal Iqbal, Basit, and Muhammad Fayaz at around 10:30 pm on Friday when the police officials showed up on motorcycles and started conducting a random body search. 
Afzal Ahmed, the complainant, further said soon situation got tense after an exchange of harsh words and a policeman later identified as Muhammad Shamrez fired gunshots with his pistol which hit the victim on the right side of the chest and he fell to the ground. He also said they shifted the injured to the Holy Family Hospital with the help of other bystanders but he succumbed to his injuries there. 
The complainant claimed that more than four eyewitnesses present at the crime scene saw the accused opening straight gunfire at the deceased. 
The other accused were later identified as Salahuddin, Arshad, and Saif, members of the said force.
Moreover, the spokesperson said a case of murder has been registered against the accused by the Pirwadhai police and the quartet has been named in the FIR. 
On the other hand, the body of the deceased has been handed over to the heirs after completion of medico-legal formalities, he said and added that the deceased was laid to rest at a local cemetery.

7,No Eid bazaars for shoppers this year,Rawalpindi district administration cancels plans to set up Eid Subsidy Bazaars due to the ongoing economic crisis,"The Rawalpindi district administration has decided to give up on its plans to set up 20 Eid Subsidy Bazaars, 16 Eid Bazaars, and 24 Eid Pushcart Bazaars due to the ongoing economic crisis.
According to sources, these Eid bazaars were being set up from the 20th of the fasting month to Chand Raat for the last 40 years. 
This year, they said, subsidy funds have not been allocated for these markets against the expectations of citizens reeling under super inflation. 
Sources also said all these Eid bazaars have been temporarily replaced by automobile workshops, parking lots and children's play areas.
Previously, the district administration ditched Ramazan Sasta Bazaars citing similar reasons. 
The administration had allowed shopkeepers to set up Ramazan Sasta Bazaars on their own, but these bazaars soon disappeared. 
On the other hand, with no hopes of Eid bazaars, deserving families have started turning to various city markets for Eid shopping.
The Eid bazaars were to be set up at Committee Chowk, Allama Iqbal Park, Dhok Hasu, Haidari Chowk, Khayaban-e-Sir Syed, Morgah, Gulzar-e-Quaid, Adiala Road, Chongi 22 and Chohar Chowk.
