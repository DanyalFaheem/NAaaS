7,Police ready poll security plan,SC to be told about help from other provinces,"Following the Supreme Court's orders in this regard, the Punjab Police has finalised its plan to provide security for the upcoming elections of the provincial assembly.
However, sources say the force may not find it possible to provide adequate number of security personnel as per the requirements of the Election Commission.
The Supreme Court had sought a security plan for the elections by April 10. After the order, the Punjab Police prepared a security plan based on the Election Commission's requirements.
According to police sources, the Election Commission has designated more than 53,000 polling stations, of which 30 per cent have been identified as sensitive with respect to security requirements.
For the sensitive polling stations, the Election Commission has requested 11 security personnel each, followed by eight for less sensitive and five for the stations deemed peaceful.
Based on the formula, the Election Commission has estimated that around 400,000 security personnel will be required for the polls in Punjab.
Punjab Police officials, however, have stated that it will be difficult to provide the requested number of personnel as per the Election Commission's formula. They claim that, based on the requirements, they can provide around 100,000 security personnel for the elections across the province.
In Lahore, more than 35,000 security personnel will perform duty during the elections. 
In addition, 50,000 personnel will be deployed for security during rallies and processions leading up to the elections. 
The election security duties will be performed by the district police, Punjab Constabulary, SPU, highway patrol and under-training personnel.
In the light of a threat of terrorism, 7,000 security personnel will be deployed to protect sensitive installations. 
However, Punjab Police officials have noted that during the census, they were only able to provide 48,000 personnel for special security duties.
They have reportedly suggested seeking assistance from the federal government and other provinces to ensure peaceful and transparent conduct of the elections.
The officials said they had prepared a security plan keeping on view the existing resources of the department and would submit their report to the Supreme Court by April 10.
On April 4, the Supreme Court declared as “unconstitutional” the Election Commission of Pakistan’s decision to postpone election in Punjab, in a blow to the government that has been trying to delay the provincial election citing security issues and the economic crisis.
The three-member bench — headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial and comprising Justice Munib Akhtar and Justice Ijazul Ahsan — also fixed May 14 as the date for the poll in the province.
On March 22, the ECP delayed the provincial assembly election in the politically crucial Punjab province by more than five months, citing the deteriorating security situation in the cash-starved country, a move criticised by PTI Chairman Imran Khan.
Since his ouster last April in a no-confidence vote in parliament, Imran has been demanding early elections. Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif has dismissed the demand and kept to elections scheduled for later this year.
The PDM government wanted national elections and the voting for the two provincial assemblies held on the same day.
“The impugned order dated 22.03.2023 made by the Election Commission of Pakistan is declared to be unconstitutional, without lawful authority or jurisdiction, void ab-initio, of no legal effect and is hereby quashed,” the ruling said.
“Neither the Constitution nor the law empowers the commission to extend the date of elections beyond the 90 days period as provided in Article 224(2) of the Constitution.”
“Elections in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa should be transparent, impartial and as per the law,” read the verdict.

8,Attack on Masjid al-Aqsa condemned,PMML terms attack by Israeli forces 'an act of terrorism' and 'conspiracy against world peace',"The Pakistan Markazi Muslim League (PMML) strongly condemned the torture of worshippers and the disrespect of the Masjid al-Aqsa by Israeli security forces. 
In a joint statement issued on Saturday, PMML President Khalid Masood Sindhu and General Secretary Chaudhry Muhammad Azam denounced the attack on innocent unarmed Palestinians as an act of terrorism, further stating that the attack on the mosque during the holy month of Ramazan was a conspiracy against world peace. 
They further condemned the Israeli forces hurting the sentiments of Muslims by attacking the first Qibla of Islam. 
They declared Israel an illegal terrorist state, further stating that this was also declared by founder of Pakistan, Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah. 
“It is unfortunate that the United Nations and other international institutions have been unable to resolve the issue of Palestine after 75 years,” they said, adding that Palestinians were neither ethically nor politically supported like they deserve. 
The PMML leaders said that all Muslim states should form a common strategy against Israel and a case should be contested in the International Court of Justice.
