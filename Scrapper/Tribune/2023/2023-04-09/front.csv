0,ECP proposes tweaks in polls law to remove ‘ambiguity',Electoral watchdog recommends amending sections 57-1 and 58 of Elections Act,"The electoral watchdog has recommended making changes in sections 57-1 and 58 of the Elections Act, 2017 to empower it to change the date and schedule of the polls – in a bid to curtail the authority of the president in these matters.
The proposed draft for the parliamentary affairs ministry in connection with the amendments to the Elections Act has been prepared.
Section 57-1 currently reads: “The President shall announce the date or dates of the general elections after consultation with the [Election] Commission [of Pakistan].”
After amending this section, the power to announce the polls date will solely lie with the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), excluding the role of the president.

The objective of the amendment is to authorise the ECP as the sole body to announce the date for the general elections.
As for section 58, in its present form it states: “The Commission may, at any time after the issue of the notification under sub-section (1) of that section [57-1], make such alterations in the Election Programme announced in that notification for the different stages of the election or may issue a fresh Election Programme as may, in its opinion to be recorded in writing, be necessary for the purposes of this Act: Provided that the Commission shall inform the President about any alteration in the Election Programme made under this sub-section.”
If the proposed amendment to this section is introduced, it will strengthen the role of the commission and allow it to announce the schedule without anyone’s “interference”.
The amendment is aimed at removing the ambiguity in the change of election programme or the issuance of a new one.
The ECP will be able to change the polls programme at various stages and give a new elections date and new schedule with written reasons.
The commission has prepared an amendment draft to send to the parliamentary affairs secretary and also sent him a letter mentioning the reasons behind the changes.
According to the text of the letter written by the ECP secretary, the commission is an autonomous body and responsible for conducting fair and transparent elections.
It added that the mandate of the ECP to conduct elections should not be subordinated to anyone.
According to the Constitution, it pointed out that the commission had to decide whether the circumstances were fit to hold the elections or not.
It complained that the recent judgments of the Supreme Court had deprived the commission of exercising the powers enumerated in Article 218-3.

The letter added that according to Article 218-3, the ECP had to review the circumstances first and then decide to hold the elections.
The commission noted in the letter that the SC’s verdicts in the Worker Party and Al-Jihad Trust cases had defined the role of the ECP.
In the Worker Party's case, the top court had declared that it was the responsibility of the ECP to conduct the elections and to make all necessary arrangements before the polls.
The letter added that the SC had observed in the case that the Constitution gave the ECP full responsibility for pre-election and polling day arrangements.
According to the Al-Jihad Trust case, it could not be said that the chief election commissioner was subordinate to any authority in discharging his responsibilities.
The letter read that no provision of the Constitution supported the president announcing the elections date after the dissolution of the National Assembly or the end of its term.
It added that it was the reason for the announcement of the elections date by the president under the Election Act, 2017 was against the constitutional design.
Therefore, the letter continued, the amendments to 57(1) and 58 were recommended to remove this ambiguity.

1,Regime-change conspiracy hatched in Pakistan: Imran,PTI chief tells workers to take to streets if govt does not hold polls on time,"While claiming that the incumbent government has undone all the good work that his government had done in its four-year rule, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief Imran Khan has reiterated that his party will take to the streets if the government does not hold polls according to the apex court’s order.
“I ask the nation and the PTI supporters to stage nationwide protests if the incumbent rulers do not hold elections,” the former prime minister said while addressing the nation on Sunday via a video link to mark the completion of one year since the ouster of his government as a result of a no-trust motion.
“I sacrificed my two provincial governments after detailed deliberations with constitutional experts. As per the Constitution, it is very clear that elections will be held within 90 days after the dissolution of an assembly. But the incumbent rulers are trying to run away from elections,” he said.
The PTI, which still controlled two provinces—Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) despite ouster of its government in the Centre, dissolved the provincial assemblies in the two provinces in mid-January in a bid to force the federal government into announcing general elections.
The coalition government has, however, refused to hold snap polls while also making attempts to delay elections in Punjab and the K-P despite a Supreme Court verdict.
The PTI chief claimed that the conspiracy to topple his government was hatched in Pakistan and not in the United States. “Former army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa conspired against an elected government in collaboration with the PDM [Pakistan Democratic Movement] parties when all economic indicators were showing positive trends.
“General Bajwa hired former Pakistani Ambassador to the US Hussain Haqqani for lobbying against my government in the US. Bajwa also joined hands with Shehbaz Sharif, who was about to be indicted in a multi-billion-rupee corruption case. The latter was then imposed on the country,” he said.
Highlighting his government’s achievements, he said when the PTI came into power, the country was virtually bankrupt as the current account deficit stood at around $20 billion.
“We stabilised the economy during the first year of our government. Later, we had to fight the coronavirus pandemic while protecting the economy and lower income strata.
“All international organisations appreciated Pakistan’s strategy to handle the pandemic and safeguard the national economy.
“Despite the pandemic, Pakistan showed historic growth ranging between 5.7% and 6% though the country had to face supply chain problems and prices super cycle owing to shortages and lockdowns.”
Imran claimed that Pakistan showed remarkable growth during his government.
“The country witnessed the highest growth rates in 70 years without the influx of dollars which historically gave a boost to the economy during military dictatorships,” he added.
Imran said he transformed terrorism into tourism. However, the incumbent rulers had undone this too. They had all their focus on closing corruption cases filed against them and saving their looted wealth.
He said after the withdrawal of the US forces from Afghanistan, it was the right time to engage with the new Afghan government to address cross-border terrorism. “However, the present government has all its focus on amending accountability laws to save their skins.”
During the PTI rule, he said, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) had recovered Rs480 billion while incumbent rulers had given themselves a waiver of Rs1,100 billion by amending the NAB laws.
“They ruined all state institutions, like NAB, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), police and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), by using them against their opponents.
“Sanctions were imposed on mainstream media; journalists and social media activists were abducted to suppress the voices. Unidentified persons were making phone calls to media owners to silence their voices.
“Such oppressive tactics have not been employed even during dictatorships. Police are being used against unarmed political workers, even women and children.”
He said around 144 cases, including 40 terrorism cases, had been registered against him. His house was attacked for requesting the court to change the venue of his case hearing for security reasons.
“Over 3,100 workers of my party have been arrested. Party leaders and workers are facing the worst custodial torture,” he said, adding that his life is still under threat.
Highlighting the economic performance of his government, Imran said, large scale manufacturing (LSM) was growing at 10%, around 5.5 million new jobs were created; IT exports showed 75% increase for the first time and historic money was pumped into the agriculture economy.
“However, all the good work has been undone by the incumbent rulers. Just in a year, the country’s economic growth rate has fallen from 6% to 0.4%. Around four million people have been pushed below the poverty line. Inflation has risen from 12% to 35% while food inflation is touching 50%.
“Price of a 20-kg wheat flour sack has increased from Rs1,140 to Rs2,800 and over 20 precious lives have been lost in the struggle to get a flour bag,” he lamented.

2,Joint sitting to tackle poll controversy,Federal cabinet likely to place election summary before parliament today,"The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) led federal government is likely to place a summary about executing the apex court’s April 4 verdict with regard to elections for the Punjab Assembly before parliament whose joint session will be held at 4pm today (Monday).
However, before the parliament’s session, another federal cabinet meeting is likely to be held at 10am to review the government’s position on the issue and to approve the summary, according to some federal ministers.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met his cabinet in Punjab’s provincial capital to discuss the controversy with regard to the apex court’s March 1 order and to review whether the Supreme Court threw out the suo motu case with regard to delay in announcement of polls in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) by a vote of 4 to 3 or accepted it by a vote of 3 to 2, said a statement.
“[The cabinet also] discussed in detail the decision of the four honorable judges,” it added.
The cabinet deliberated on the resolution passed by the National Assembly on April 6 to assess its legal worth. In the resolution, the lower house of parliament had asked the prime minister and his cabinet not to implement the SC’s April 4 order for holding elections in Punjab on May 14.
According to the statement, Federal Minister for Law Senator Azam Nazir Tarar briefed the meeting on various constitutional and legal issues and answered the questions of the cabinet members.
After carefully reviewing all aspects and detailed consultation, the cabinet unanimously directed the Ministry of Finance to prepare a summary in consultation with the Ministry of Law in accordance with the procedure and regulations to get guidance from the parliament in this matter.
This summary will be presented before the cabinet today. The meeting will also decide the government’s future strategy.
Talking to The Express Tribune, Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said that the finance ministry will present the summary in order to brief the government on the execution of all the court orders, adding that since there is more than one order in the field, every order will have financial ramifications.
When asked if the government – in case the SC’s April 4 decision is not executed using the parliament as a shield – was prepared for contempt of court proceedings, the information minister asked how could the government commit contempt of court when there are two contradictory SC orders.
She said the summary being prepared by the law minister and the finance ministry will be first placed before the cabinet for approval and later presented in parliament.
When asked what approval the government wants to seek from the parliament as in the absence of any real opposition it can take any decision, she said that parliament’s collective wisdom will dictate their decisions.
Marriyum, however, clarified that no agenda had been issued for Monday’s cabinet meeting.
Talking to The Express Tribune, State Minister Hashim Notezai said the issue of releasing funds to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to hold elections in Punjab and the K-P provinces will be placed before the parliament for review.
“The parliament is the supreme institution and has the legal right to weigh in on the issue. The parliament will also be informed about the economic situation of the country; so that it may take an informed decision on the matter.”
When asked if the government had decided to deny funds to the ECP, he said: “It will be decided in parliament tomorrow.”
Talking with reference to the cabinet meeting, he said the cabinet also reviewed the discussions held at the recent National Security Committee (NSC) meeting.
The NSC on April 7 decided to launch a comprehensive operation against terrorists, as the country’s civil and military leadership virtually issued a charge-sheet against the previous government and the establishment for allowing militants to regroup.
Discussion with some federal ministers revealed that the government will present its case before parliament in order to delay elections in Punjab most likely by not releasing funds to the ECP as per the Supreme Court orders.
A federal minister, who belongs to an allied party, said it seemed that the government wanted to have the parliament’s stamp of approval on its decision to delay polls in Punjab and the K-P.
When asked if the government had decided to commit contempt of court, he said: “Not necessarily. The government will try to find a way out of contempt of court and to remain on the right side of law.”
Talking to media after the cabinet meeting, Special Assistant to the PM Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan referred to the SC’s March 1 order and said there are two verdicts of the SC on the same issue.
“So what is the actual court order as I am unable to understand this despite being a lawyer. Justice Athar Minallah’s note has further complicated the matter,” he said.
Reiterating the government position on the issue of elections, he said as far as elections are concerned, they think elections should be held simultaneously throughout the country under a caretaker setup.
“There are other articles of law besides holding elections in 90 days that should be adhered to.”
To a question about giving funds to the ECP, he said: “The position of parliament and the cabinet on the issue is that everything will be done in accordance with the law.”
Parliament’s joint session
At the parliament’s joint session today, Minister of Law and Justice Senator Azam Nazir Tarar will submit a motion to take into consideration the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Bill, 2023 to establish certain rules and procedures of the apex court.
The bill was sent back by President Arif Alvi under Clause 6 of Article 75 of the Constitution.
During the joint sitting, the parliamentary affairs minister is scheduled to present seven motions with regard to law and order, terrorism, economic policy, Jammu and Kashmir and foreign policy for creating awareness on national issues and achieving consensus.

4,"After wedge among judges, SCBA also split","10 of 17 members differ with association’s president, secy","After the differences seen among Supreme Court judges, a body representing lawyers is also split in the ongoing judicial politics.
The representatives of the Professional Group, which is known to be pro-PTI, are backing the SC judges led by Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial.
However, the Independent Group, which is known to be pro-Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), is supporting the other section of the SC judges, led by Justice Qazi Faez Isa.
It is being witnessed that judicial politics has already turned into a civil war, wherein both sides are taking every step to achieve supremacy.
Even rules, procedures, law, etc are not being followed.
The Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) – the apex regularity body of lawyers -- led by the Independent Group is demanding the constitution of a full court to hear the case pertaining to the elections. Interestingly, both groups were united against the PTI government when it moved a presidential reference for the removal of Justice Isa.
The Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) has again come to the surface, when 10 out of 17 members of its executive body expressed serious reservations over the statement issued by their president Abid Zuberi and secretary to express solidarity with the CJP's stance as well as against the National Assembly’s resolution against a top court three-judge bench’s decision to hold the elections in Punjab on May 14.
“We, the majority of executive committee members of SCBAP [Supreme Court Bar Association of Pakistan] (10 out of 17), regret, and express our serious reservations on a non-representative statement of [the] president and secretary, without taking into confidence the majority [of the members]. We express that they have not only tried to deepen the differences among SC judges but also tried to attack the supremacy of parliament, which can never be approved by the majority of executive [committee members],” read a statement issued by 10 SCBA members, disowning the views of the president and secretary of the bar.
These 10 members belong to the Independent Group.
They further demanded that CJP Bandial should immediately call a full court meeting to patch up all the differences between judges, being the head of the institution.
The 10 members added that the top judge should also constitute a full court bench to rectify all dissenting decisions to maintain the trust of the public at large as well as all the stakeholders.
They also warned the SCBA president and secretary that they should not act as spokespersons for a political party, and work for the welfare of the bar as well as for the supremacy of the Constitution instead.
Earlier, the SCBA president and secretary issued a statement, wherein they took serious exception to the “blatantly illegal resolution” passed by the NA on April 6 against the SC’s three-judge bench that ordered the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to hold polls in Punjab on May 14.
“It is unfortunate that the National Assembly which is bound to act in accordance with the Constitution, has blatantly disregarded Article 68…which prohibits any discussions in the parliament with respect to conduct of any judge of the Supreme Court or a high court in discharge of his duties,” the statement issued by the SCBA president and secretary read.
“Whereas members of parliament have made disparaging and extremely disrespectful comments against members of the judiciary which is not only violative of the Constitution but a direct challenge to the integrity of the judiciary,” it added.
It further stated that the resolution would lead to absolute chaos and anarchy when stability and a democratically elected government are the need of the hour.
The NA on April 6 adopted a resolution declaring that the parliament rejected the SC’s April 4 “minority” judgment in connection with holding polls in Punjab on May 14.
The resolution asked the prime minister and the federal cabinet not to implement the decision while urging the top court to form a full court to review the “rewriting” of the Constitution under Article 63-A.
It also expressed concern about the “undue judicial interference” in political matters.
It maintained that the recent judgment of the apex court was creating political instability in the country and paving the way for division of the federating units.
In another statement, the SCBA condemned the alleged smear campaign launched against some SC judges.
It also condemned the “derogatory” remarks and statements passed against these judges at public rallies, congregations and parliament.
“Without any stretch of imagination, it is obvious that the purpose of the said smear campaign is to pressure the judiciary so as to achieve an unconstitutional and undemocratic agenda,” the statement read.
“The SCBA will continue to lend its unwavering support towards upholding the rule of law, independence of institutions and supremacy of the Constitution of Pakistan,” it added.
The SCBA urged all stakeholders to amicably reach a consensus to safeguard the integrity of the judiciary and to restore the political as well as economic stability in the country.
In yet another press statement, the SCBA described a complaint filed to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) against CJP Bandial as “blatantly illegal” and “yet another attempt to subvert the Constitution.”
The complaint, filed by lawyer Raja Sibtain Khan, alleged that the CJP engaged in misconduct by dividing judges into groups and securing their support to influence the outcome of a case.
The complaint claims that the actions of the CJP, while hearing a suo motu case in connection with the postponement of the polls in Punjab, violated the Constitution and the fundamental rights of the people of Pakistan.
It added that the top judge’s actions amounted to unfaithfulness and disloyalty to the State.
The complainant called for an investigation into the matter while demanding the removal of the CJP from his post.
Commenting on the complaint, the SCBA said it was clear that the reference against the CJP was yet another attempt to delay the elections in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.
“[Any delay in elections will, however, be] in blatant violation of Article 224 (2) of the Constitution and the orders of the SC in SMC No 01/2023 and CP No 05/2023 dated March 1, 2023 and April 4, 2023 respectively,” it added.

5,Changes in contempt law on the cards,Amid worsening govt-judiciary standoff PM to chair cabinet meeting today,"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has called a meeting of the federal cabinet on Sunday (today) to contemplate on the ongoing political, economic, and constitutional crises amid a face-off between the government and the judiciary over the judgment of Punjab polls case.
The prime minister has called the federal cabinet’s meeting a day after the federal government demanded Chief Justice of Pakistan Justice Umar Ata Bandial’s resignation over the “controversial” choices he made while directing the electoral body to hold election in Punjab on May 14.
The cabinet meeting will be held at 2pm at Prime Minister House and the premier will chair it via video link from Lahore. Sources said that the government was also gearing up to bring amendments in contempt law as well as making it mandatory through legislation to table reports against judges submitted in the Supreme Judicial Council before parliament.
However, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb refrained from confirming if the cabinet would be considering the same in Sunday’s meeting when approached for a comment.
The minister said she would get back on it but could not till the filing of this news story.
The demand of CJP’s resignation came on April 7 when the information minister demanded that the chief justice should step down as his position had become controversial, especially, after Supreme Court’s Justice Athar Minallah’s note in the Punjab poll case.
The government spokesperson said that the decision given by Justice Minallah put a question mark on the judicial process, adding that a three-member bench led by the CJP was formed on the petition that was already dismissed by four judges of the apex court.
She said there was no point in taking the matter any further as it was dismissed by four judges out the seven-member bench.
The cabinet meeting has also been called at a time when President Dr Arif Alvi returned the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Bill, 2023, which targeted to curtail the CJP’s powers to take suo motu notice and constitute benches on his own, to parliament for reconsideration.
Sources in the government said that the coalition cabinet would deliberate on the president’s move and was likely to present the bill with allies’ consent in the joint session of parliament scheduled to be held on Monday.
The officials of the National Assembly said that the agenda of the joint session had not yet been issued but it would most likely include the bill clipping the CJP’s powers, adding that the bill would automatically become a law after 10 days once passed by the joint sitting under Article 75 of the Constitution.
Admitting that the calling cabinet meeting on Sunday was unusual, a cabinet member said that the cabinet would mull on the government’s strategy about the current political volatility, the role of the CJP and “like-minded judges or politicians in robes”, the schism in the apex court judges and how it gave birth to a constitutional crisis. The huddle would also deliberate on the future strategy of the government.
Additionally, the sources said that the PM would take the cabinet into confidence on the decisions taken in the meeting of the National Security Committee (NSC).
On Friday, the NSC decided to launch a comprehensive operation against terrorists, as the country’s civil and military leadership virtually issued a charge-sheet against the previous government and the establishment for allowing the banned TTP to regroup.
Against the backdrop of a host of developments both on the political and security fronts, the NSC linked the surge in terrorism with the previous dispensation’s policy of appeasement towards the TTP, which was completely contrary to public expectations and aspirations.
The assembly officials said that the NA would commemorate the Golden Jubilee of the Constitution on Monday, which would be followed by an assembly session and the joint session in the afternoon.
