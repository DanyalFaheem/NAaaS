0,49 BRT buses parked under open sky in Peshawar,Lack of protective sheds may lead to damage to the costly buses in bad weather conditions,"A total of 49 BRT buses are parked under the open sky at Chamkani depots and although protective sheds to protect the vehicles from extreme weather conditions were part of the project, they have not been constructed.
A visit to the depot at Chamkani reveals that the passenger buses are parked under the open sky and there are chances of damage to these costly buses due to bad weather conditions.
In the original BRT project, protective sheds for these buses were part of the design but these sheds have not been constructed due to unknown reasons.
A single BRT bus costs at least Rs50 million, the official, who wished not to be named, said, adding that the total cost of 49 buses parked there amounted to Rs2.70 billion.
Out of 220 BRT buses, 171 buses are being operated on different routes, he informed, while the rest are in open storage.
The minister in-charge has already imposed a ban on direct contact with media, so no one is ready to share his or her comment about any project in the pipeline regarding construction of protective sheds for the buses to preserve these expensive buses and save precious funds from going to waste.

1,K-P Bar Council asks CJ to step down,Says his decisions have stained judicial system of country,"Khyber-Pakthunkhwa Bar Council has demanded of the Chief Justice Umar Atta Bandial to step down over what it called his authoritative style.
“From the dissenting note of the Justice Athar Minallah, it is now clear that the suo moto was rejected by four to three verdict but due to his ego the chief justice went his way and earned the judiciary a bad name,” the bar council statement said.
In a press statement issued here on Saturday, Vice Chairman of the Bar Council Zar Badshah Khan Advocate said that the chief justice has adopted an authoritative style in Supreme Court, which has left the judicial system stained.
“The chief justice has violated his oath and the judicial code of conduct,” he observed, adding that the dissenting note by Justice Athar Minallah has showed that the case had been decided by the majority but chief justice told lies about the decision.
“The K-P Bar Council has filed a reference against Justice Mazahar Ali Naqvi in Supreme Judicial Council but still he is made part of the benches and senior judges are ignored in the benches,” he maintained, adding that it is the clear cut violation of the judicial code of conduct.
Zar Badshah said that the chief justice has failed completely in fulfilling his constitutional responsibilities as chairman judicial council because he didn’t nominate any judges from Peshawar High Court.
“The chief justice didn’t nominate any judge from PHC for judicial council and the meeting of the judicial council is not being called to make the chief justice PHC permanent and this injustice is being done intentionally,” he added.
He demanded of the federal government to file a reference against the chief justice so that to restore the trust of the general public on the Supreme Court.
