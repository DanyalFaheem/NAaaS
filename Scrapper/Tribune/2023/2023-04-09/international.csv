4,‘Full court bench only solution’,Murtaza Wahab says the Constitution of Pakistan came after great sacrifices,"The spokesperson and adviser on law for the Sindh government, Barrister Murtaza Wahab has suggested that the easiest solution to resolve the current dispute is for all the judges to sit together and decide under Article 167. 
According to him, the Supreme Court comprises all 15 judges, not just one, and forming a full court is the only way to resolve the conflict. Wahab emphasised that errors should be identified through consultation and nations that learn from their mistakes are called living nations. 
He added that the Constitution of Pakistan came after great sacrifices and the 18th constitutional amendment provided judicial independence. Under the 18th amendment, Parliament corrected past mistakes and Article 10A was introduced, which requires that no decision should be taken without hearing everyone. The judiciary is now evolving in the same way democracy has gone through, he said.

5,Karachi flour millers warn of price escalation in city,Ch Aamir claims government is procuring and dumping all private wheat,"The Sindh Food Department is said to have imposed an unannounced ban on the private purchase of wheat for the flour mills in the metropolitan city. 
Chaudhry Aamir, Chairman of the Sindh chapter of Pakistan Flour Mills Association, has blamed Food Department Director Imdad Ali Shah for obstructing delivery of private wheat to Karachi.
""Karachi's flour mills are not being allowed to procure wheat,"" he said while speaking to The Express Tribune. ""Due to the non-availability of private wheat, all flour mills of Karachi have virtually stopped,"" he added. 
""Food Department Director Imdad Ali Shah has taken the flour mills hostage,"" he alleged and warned that this situation would aggravate wheat flour crisis in the city.
Ch Aamir claimed that the government was procuring and dumping all private wheat, while some stockists have so far stacked up 10 million sacks of private wheat.
""The stockists arbitrarily increase the wheat rates on an almost daily basis,"" he claimed. ""It seems that the Food Department wants to extort money by dumping all private wheat of Sindh.""

6,SHC orders demolition of six-storey building,Ground-plus-five structure was illegally raised in Shanti Nagar,"The Sindh High Court (SHC) has ordered demolition of a six-story structure connected to unlawful constructions in Shanti Nagar, Gulshan-e-Iqbal. 
Appearing before the bench on Saturday, the petitioner's counsel stated that a ground plus five-storey structure was illegally raised on Plot No. A59 in Block-19 of Shanti Nagar, but the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) was reluctant to pursue legal action against the owner.
In their response, SBCA officials admitted before the court that the building was unlawful as construction of a ground plus five-storey structure was not permitted in Shanti Nagar.
""If the building is unlawful, then appropriate action should have been taken,"" the bench remarked. The court then ordered demolition of the building and sought a compliance report by April 28.
Meanwhile, another SHC bench disposed of a petition against inclusion of a candidate in the recent local bodies' election in wrong voters list by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP). The petition was filed by Muhammad Aslam, a candidate in the LB elections.
Appearing before the court, the lawyer for the petitioner Usman Farooq Advocate confirmed that his candidate's name has been included in the correct voters' list by the ECP. He requested the court for the withdrawal of his petition which the court granted.
In the earlier petition, Usman Farooq Advocate had contended that his client Muhammad Aslam's old residential address was entered in the new voters list. ""However, the election was postponed due to the death of a candidate; otherwise my client would have been out of the race,"" he further submitted.
For the by-elections, the ECP says that polling will now be conducted as per the new voters list, according to the petitioner. ""I was also barred from re-submitting my nomination papers for the by-election. In such a scenario, if the election is held, my vote will go to another ward,"" he stated.
He prayed the court ordered NADRA and ECP officials to rectify this mistake as soon as possible because ""if it is not rectified, I shall not be able to contest the election"". Meanwhile, an accountability court rejected Dr Asim Hussain's plea for acquittal in a corruption reference involving Rs17 billion. 
Dr Asim Hussain and other accused appeared in the court which ruled against acquittal of the accused. According to NAB, Dr Asim and others are accused of corruption worth Rs17 billion in connection with gas contracts.

7,Committee to examine SGH Liaquatabad affairs,"Lack of medicines, broken machines, and a shortage of staff have been causing difficulties for the patients","The Sindh Government Hospital Liaquatabad has come under scrutiny due to the poor state of medical facilities and indiscipline.
Lack of medicines, broken machines, and a shortage of staff have been causing difficulties for the patients. 
The news reported by The Express Tribune on April 5, 2023 revealed that many doctors and medical staff are absent from their duties in afternoon and night shifts, leaving wards without adequate care or supervision.
Sources have revealed that CBC and urea tests are currently being performed, with no biochemistry tests available for patients. 
The hospital has seen a significant decrease in patient admissions, with only seven patients currently admitted, down from an average of 60 to 70 patients in the past.
One of the most concerning issues raised in the report is the lack of an anti-rabies vaccine. The hospital has been ordered by the Supreme Court to provide the vaccine, but there are fears that the stock of medicines in the hospital will expire shortly. 
Moreover, patients from the gynaecology ward are reportedly being referred to private hospitals while CT scans, lithotripsy machines, doppler ultrasound, echo, and CTG machines are not in working condition.
The news has caught the attention of Sindh Health and Population Minister Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, who formed an inquiry committee to examine the situation at the hospital.
