0,WHO to help revive 150 healthcare centres,Sindh govt signs deal for programme in flood-hit districts,"The World Health Organization (WHO) will collaborate with the Sindh government to rehabilitate 150 primary healthcare facilities in 21 flood-affected districts.
Sindh Minister of Health and Population Welfare of Sindh Dr Azra Pechuho met WHO representative in Pakistan Dr Palitha Gunarathna Mahipala at the Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) to sign an MoU in this regard on Friday.
Dr Pechuho and WHO representative Dr. Mahipala discussed the solarization of various vaccine storage facilities in the province as well as the provision of vaccine for children who have not received any doses yet. They will be targeted with the help of WHO and the Expanded Programme on Immunizatio (EPI). 
The health minister suggested that there should be specific places for vaccination to reduce the distance traveled by the community. The people should be informed about these designated places so that they can easily bring children for vaccination.
The minister also thanked WHO for all the support it has provided in the province and the work it continues to do in partnership with the health department.
New Challenges 
Dr Mahipala has said that Covid-19 is no longer a pandemic. The spread of the virus was declining rapidly. However, new variants of the virus continue to emerge and functional genomic sequencing labs are indispensable to deal with such variants, he added. One of the five genomic sequencing labs in Pakistan is located at Dow University.
He expressed these views while addressing a ceremony held at Dow University of Health Sciences on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the World Health Organization and World Health Day. Dr Mahipala said that according to the Universal Health Coverage Index, about fifty percent of people in Pakistan have access to basic health facilities. 
He said that small pox emerged as a disease in 1806 and in 1980 the World Health Organization declared that small pox was eradicated from the world. The campaign to eradication polio started in 1988 but it has not been possible to eradicate polio from Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Professor Muhammad Saeed Qureshi, the university's vice chancellor, said that the university was tasked the Infectious Diseases Hospital during the coronavirus, and it continues to treat infectious diseases even after the pandemic. 
During the last three months, 36 children were admitted to the hospital with diphtheria although diphtheria had been eradicated. Another 13 children were admitted with measles during the same period, apparently due to lack of immunization, he added.

1,Stampede deaths: court rejects factory owner’s bail plea,Decision after submission of challan,"The additional district and sessions judge West dismissed on Friday the bail application of the factory owner and others in the case of a deadly stampede during Zakat distribution at a factory last week. Twelve people, mostly women and children, were killed and 10 were injured in the stampede.
Factory owner Abdul Khaliq's lawyer told the court that his client was giving cash to the relatives of employees of the factory who had died in the recent past. He said this was an annual practice. 
This time, however, people tried to force their way into the factory. 
He said the deaths were due to an accident and urged the court to dismiss the case against the factory owner. 
He said that the factory owner was not present at the time of stampede. 
Meanwhile, the public prosecutor argued that a case was registered against the accused under the provisions governing negligence and recklessness. The accused had not alerted the police or the civil administration about their plan. The incident took place due to the carelessness of the accused.
In its remarks, the court said that bail cannot be approved in the initial phase of the case. 
Illegal construction 
The Sindh High Court turned out several petitions pertaining to illegal construction and encroachment while noting that such concerns should be raised at the relevant fora. 
The court stated that complainant's first port of call should be the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) in matters of unauthorised buildings.

2,Zoo head Khalid Hashmi dismissed over negligence,Elephants to be moved to Safari Park,"Khalid Hashmi, the head of the zoo who has faced criticism over neglect that has led to the death of several animals, has been removed from his post over negligence. 
According to a notification, Karachi Municipal Corporation's (KMC) Senior Director Hashmi was removed from his post for negligence in the case of the elephant Noor Jehan. 
Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori had expressed his displeasure over Hashmi's absence during the elephant's operation earlier this week. Hashmi maintains that he had informed the KMC administrator regarding his mother's health due to which he had to stay away.
The zoo head has also faced criticism following allegations that food supplies to the zoo had been suspended after contractors claimed that officials were demanding kickbacks.
Relocation
The two African elephants, Noor Jehan and Madhubala, will soon be shifted to the Safari Park. A team of vets from Four Paws visited the park on Thursday to assess the enclosure and area dedicated for elephants. The team expressed their satisfaction and deemed it advisable to relocate the two elephants there. 
They also brought mounds of mud to the sick elephant's cramped enclosure at the zoo. Previously, the cage did not have any soil. 
The veterinarians also placed tires in the cage to allow the elephants to play and exercise. 
Water was arranged in the pool to help the partially disabled Noor Jahan to exercise. These improvements have resulted in a better condition for the ailing animal, as her swelling has reduced, and she is taking food while trying to walk, the vets added.

5,Varsities to mark ‘black day’ over PhD’s murder,"Police fail to make substantial arrests, say accused fled with their families","The killing of an assistant professor of Sukkur IBA University in Kashmore-Kandhkot district on April 6 has sparked protests and condemnation in the whole province but no immediate reaction can be seen from the policy makers with regard to rampant kidnappings and tribal feuds in upper Sindh. 
The Federation of All Pakistan Universities Academic Staff Association (FAPUASA) on Friday announced that the teachers in universities across Sindh will observe a black day on Monday, April 10, to condemn the killing of Sukkur IBA University’s Prof Assistant Prof Ajmal Sawand, 38, and to express solidarity.
The opposition leader in the Sindh Assembly, Haleem Adil Sheikh, as well as nationalist leaders condemned the killing and blamed the Pakistan Peoples Party’s government in Sindh for continuing to give a free hand to criminal feudal lords, tribal chiefs and dacoits. 
He bemoaned that a PhD in artificial intelligence who left his teaching career in Paris, France, to teach the youth in his own province was shot dead over no fault of his own. 
Dr Fahad Nazir Khoso, the president of FAPUASA Sindh chapter, expressed shock at the savage killing of Dr Sawand. He said the slain teacher was not involved in any tribal rift but still his life was taken to settle tribal scores. He demanded immediate action against the culprits while announcing a province wide protest for April 10. 
Meanwhile, Sindh Taraqi Pasand party has announced protests across the province for April 9. The party’s chairman Dr Qadir Magsi said the entire province was mourning Dr Sawand’s killing. “Tribal warfare needs to be stopped but the government doesn’t seem to bothered,” he observed. These clashes can end if the government arrests the tribal chiefs who are fuelling such disputes, he added.
The president of Jeay Sindh Mahaz, Riaz Ali Chandio, accused the provincial government for deliberately letting the tribal clashes and dacoits take the rural society hostage so that it can manipulate frightened and controlled people. The Sindh United Party’s President Syed Zain Shah said the government has made the feudal and tribal chiefs the makers and enforcers of law in their respective areas. 
Investigation
The Kashmore-Kandhkot police raided the village Sardar Khan Sundrani in Kankhkot on Thursday to arrest the suspects but the main accused had already escaped with their families. The police officials disclosed that six suspects had been picked up in connection with the incidents but none of them were among the persons nominated in the FIR.
The A-Section police in Kandhkot registered the FIR of the killing, nominating 10 persons with names besides two unidentified men. Although the district’s SSP Irfan Samo had told The Express Tribune that the cause of the murder was “honour killing”, the complainant in the FIR stated that the accused were seeking extortion.
“Around 15 days ago when my brother and I went to our agriculture field in Kankhkot, Aijan Ali Sundrani and his armed men approached us and demanded Rs2 million extortion from my brother,” stated victim’s brother Ashraf Sawand in the FIR. 
According to him, Sundrani had warned his brother that if his latest warning was ignored, then Sawand would be kidnapped for ransom.
The complainant stated that on April 6 when they were leaving in their vehicle for Sukkur, Sundranis intercepted them on the road and shot his brother dead.

6,MQM-P expresses concern on rising street crimes,Says out of control situation is a big question mark on efficiency of LEAs,"The Coordination Committee of Muttahida Qaumi Movement Pakistan (MQM-P) has expressed concern over the increasing incidents of street crimes in Karachi and said that the law enforcement agencies (LEAs) have failed to control the criminal elements involved in snatching, theft and robberies. 
The committee said that the citizens of Karachi are being deprived of their valuable goods worth millions of rupees every day. An alarmingly large number of street crimes have been reported in the city during the past three months. 
According to newspaper reports, more than 19,000 citizens have been deprived of their motorcycles, mobile phones, and vehicles. The committee said that these are the reported figures when citizens approached the police stations, while there are thousands of people who did not file any complaints. Robbers shot and killed 34 civilians during robbery incidents. 
The crime situation in the city is a big question mark on the efficiency of law enforcement agencies. 
The cmmittee said that handing over the metropolitan city to the police officers belonging to remote areas of Sindh is a criminal negligence. 
The incompetent and biased government of Sindh has made the largest city of Pakistan a favourite for professional bandits.
Meanwhile, the Coordination Committee of MQM-P has strongly condemned the killing of IBA Professor Dr. Ajmal Sawand in a tribal dispute in Kandhkot. The coordination committee said that due to tribal enmity in Sindh, many precious lives have been lost so far, but no steps are being taken by the Sindh government to prevent it, which is sad. 
The committee said that a messiah who got education from a top university in France and left a better life in Europe and came back to the home country to serve the people of Sindh, has been murdered. The MQM-P stands with the family of Ajmal Sawand in this hour of sorrow.
