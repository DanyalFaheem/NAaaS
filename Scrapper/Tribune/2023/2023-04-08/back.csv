1,Gandapur summoned for indictment in suicide attack case,Party fails to stop PTI leader from being handed over to Islamabad police,"An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Dera Ismail Khan has summoned Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader Ali Amin Khan Gandapur on April 11 to indict him in the suicide attack case.
Former Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) law minister Israrullah Khan Gandapur was killed in the attack.
The accused's brother, Sardar Umar Amin Khan Gandapur, the city mayor of DI Khan tehsil, is currently on bail in the same case.
The attack that killed Israrullah occurred on the first day of Eidul Azha in 2013 at the Gandapur Cottage in Kulachi. The case was registered at the Kulachi police station on the complaint of a close associate of the victim, Jehangir.
Ali Amin, a prominent PTI leader, was allegedly involved in the suicide attack, which resulted in the death of the K-P law minister.
On Saturday, Ali Amin was handed over to the Islamabad police after the Punjab police failed to complete the necessary paperwork, despite the court's orders.
According to reports, Ali Amin was not handed over to the Punjab police, who were supposed to take him, as they could not complete the required documents. Therefore, the Islamabad police, who were handling the cases filed against Ali Amin in Islamabad, reached DI Khan to take him into custody.

Upon learning about his extradition, PTI leaders Asad Qaiser, Pervez Khattak, and Azam Swati reached DI Khan and consulted legal experts at the judicial complex to prevent Ali Amin's extradition to Islamabad. However, despite their best efforts, they were unable to stop the transfer of Ali Amin to the capital police.
At the court's gate, the PTI workers protested against the handover of Ali Amin to the Islamabad police. Still, the police took him from another gate. The situation became tense, and DI Khan police arrested six focal persons, including Ali Amin's personal secretary Latif Niazi, for violating Section 144. It was previously reported that Niazi was being deported from Pakistan after being declared an Afghan citizen.
The PTI workers continued to protest against the handover of Ali Amin to the Islamabad police, as they blocked traffic by burning tyres between Town Hall Road and Jail Road in DI Khan.

3,"Rupee depreciation burdening MoFA, NA told",Ministry of Foreign Affairs official that the govt has to pay in dollars to meet expenses of foreign missions,"Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs Syed Hussain Tariq on Friday told the National Assembly that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) pays its diplomatic missions in dollars and that steep depreciation of the Pakistani Rupee has put more burden on the ministry's finances.
""The ministry is providing funds in US dollars at an official rate for conversion of grants prevailing before the budget,"" Tariq said while responding to a query of MNA Saira Bano, who belongs to the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA).
Bano had asked for clarification with regard to reports that the old Pakistan embassy building in Washington was being allegedly used by the ambassador. She had also asked when this  building was going to be sold as its auction bid had already been done.
Tariq said there was only one property being sold in Washington after approval of an inter ministerial committee comprising  MoFA and housing and finance ministries. ""No other property has been sold or bought in the past five years by the ministry.""
He said the previous embassy building was very old and its maintenance cost MoFA dearly.
""The bidding process was completed  through a realtor hired for the purpose and the highest bidder got the property. Bids from Washington were received by the cabinet,"" he said.
MNA Mir Ghulam Ali Talpur of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) asked as to what was  the ministry's plan to sell its high-end properties and establishments of missions to save precious national exchequer ""as the country's population and number of expatriates have  been rising, demanding more resources"".
The secretary told the assembly that MoFA is meeting  90% of the expenses of its diplomatic missions from its budget allocation. The official told the house that embassies also generate funds through visa service and other facilities to meet their needs.
MNA Wajiha Qamar of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) suggested that budgetary deductions should be made to improve performance of the Pakistani embassies. Moreover, she queried about the dollar exchange rate used to pay expenses of the diplomatic missions.
MNA Shagufta Jumani of the PPP also raised her concern over lack of an embassy building in  Iraq despite the fact that it was a significant place which thousands of Pakistani pilgrims visit every year. She asked whether the ministry intended to establish any formal embassy in Iraq as the Pakistani embassy right now operates from a hotel.
The MoFA official said due to disturbed situation in Iraq the embassy had been established in a hotel, where the embassy staff is positively available to ensure proper facilitation of the pilgrims. ""There is a plan to build an embassy in Iraq,"" he added.

6,"India's IWT letter a ploy, Senate told",Climate minister says Modi govt wants to use issue to get popular vote in next polls,"Lawmakers in the upper house of the parliament have urged the government to effectively respond to the Indian attempt to change the Indus Waters Treaty, a deal brokered by the World Bank between the two rival countries to share the water available in the Indus River and its tributaries.
A number of senators--including Leader of Opposition Senator Shahzad Waseem, Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed and Senator Kamran Murtaza--on Friday called attention to a notice send to Pakistan via the Permanent Indus Commission (PIC), a bilateral commission consisting of officials from India and Pakistan.
India  on January 25 sent the notice to Pakistan seeking renegotiation of the treaty, which governs water-sharing for six rivers – the Indus, Chenab, Jhelum, Beas, Ravi and Sutlej.
Taking the floor, Mushahid Hussain Sayed said Pakistan needs internal unity in order to effectively respond to India. He lamented that the army and judiciary are being targeted and political stakeholders are levelling serious allegations against each other.
Referring to the ongoing political turmoil, he said the coalition government will have to sit down across the table with the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in order to resolve the  crisis.
""When we can talk to the Taliban and [Indian Prime Minister Narendra] Modi then why can't we talk to the PTI?""
The senator, who belongs to the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), said the government will have to comply with the Constitution and hold elections within the stipulated time.
Senator Kamran Murtaza said the nation will have to first resolve its internal dispute over water sharing and then give a strong message to India.
""We need to protect our water; otherwise we will lose this precious resource,"" he said.
Murtaza said India violated the IWT earlier and built controversial dams but Pakistan could do nothing except lodging protests.
He said Pakistani officials have in the past shown criminal negligence at various international forums and damaged the interests of the country with regard to its water resources.
""We need to give a strong response to this move by India to renegotiate the IWT,"" he added.
Responding to the call attention notice on behalf of the minister for water resources, Federal Minister for Climate Change Senator Sherry Rehman informed the house about the contents of the Indian notice.
She said India has accused Pakistan of violating the agreement and committing material breaches while making vague demands for modifying the IWT.
""It seems that the Indian government has raised the issue in an aggressive manner in order to garner public support ahead of the Indian general election,"" she said.
""Responding to the letter in an aggressive manner will not be a proper strategy as the Modi government apparently wants to provoke Pakistan.""  She assured the Senate that the government is fully cognizant of the matter and is dealing with it on its merits.
""According to Article XII (4) of the IWT, the provisions of this treaty shall continue to remain in force until terminated by a duly ratified treaty concluded for that purpose between the two governments.
""The WT is the only ratified treaty between Pakistan and India and has not been replaced by a duly ratified treaty concluded between the two governments; therefore, the IWT is the instrument in force and will continue to be in force.""
She said it is imperative for India to ensure implementation of the treaty in its true letter and spirit. Rehman said in the past, Pakistan raised objections to the design of Baglihar Dam and challenged legality of diversion of the River Kishanganga into Wullar.
""Presently, Pakistan has disputed India’s Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric plants and moved the Court of Arbitration to interpret various provisions of the treaty for settlement of systemic issues concerning its interpretation and application.""
The minister said that the PIC as defined in the treaty is the appropriate forum to raise and discuss any concerns. Pakistan is, therefore,  happy to engage on any outstanding issue regarding the treaty.
""The government has made deliberations with all relevant stakeholders, and a response was sent to India on April 1, 2023, seeking clarification from the Indian side about the contents of their letter. The response has been made while considering the national interests of the country."" Rehman said Pakistan is not panicking and is vigilant about its water resources.
""The IWT has survived all kinds of tensions between the two countries and has played a vital role in managing the water resources between India and Pakistan. Pakistan is committed to the treaty and expects India to comply with it,"" she added.

9,US ‘arms left behind being used by terrorists’ against Pak,Report rejects Afghan claims TTP not using its soil against Pakistan,"After the United States pulled out its troops from Afghanistan, it left behind military equipment and weapons worth $7 billion which later boosted the military capabilities of the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and Baloch separatist groups.
According to a report by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFERL), the US left behind weapons and equipment, including firearms, communications gear, and even armored vehicles which gave the militants a “vast war chest”.
Pakistan always desired not to indulge in blame game with Afghanistan and had repeatedly urged the interim Afghan government to establish its writ in the country.
The RFERL report rejected Kabul’s claims that the TTP was not using the Afghan soil against Pakistan as the presence of the TTP, Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) and other terrorist groups in Afghanistan was an undeniable reality.
The report said that using the US weapons and equipment, both the TTP and Baloch separatist groups were waging insurgencies against the government in Pakistan, which witnessed a surge in violence over the past two years.
“These weapons have added to the lethality of such groups,” Asfandyar Mir, a senior analyst at the United States Institute of Peace, said.
Experts said armed groups had obtained advanced US weapons and equipment like M16 machine guns and M4 assault rifles, night-vision goggles, and military communication gear.
Abdul Sayed, a Sweden-based researcher who tracks the TTP, said the group’s access to sophisticated combat weapons had had a “terrifying” impact, especially on the lesser-equipped police force in Pakistan.
According to the Pakistan Institute of Peace Studies (PIPS), a think tank in Islamabad, the number of terrorist attacks in the country increased by 27 per cent last year compared to 2021. At least 419 people were killed, while 734 injured in 262 terrorist attacks last year.
The Taliban spokesperson however rejected claims that it had supplied the TTP fighters with US weapons and equipment.
“If some weapons are being smuggled, they are far fewer and not of much concern,” the report quoted Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesperson, as saying.
