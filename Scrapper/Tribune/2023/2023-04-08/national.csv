0,World food prices fall for 12th month in a row,"Ample supplies, subdued demand contribute to drop","The United Nations food agency’s world price index fell in March for a 12th consecutive month, and is now down 20.5% from a record high hit one year ago, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The Food and Agriculture Organisation’s (FAO) price index, which tracks the most globally traded food commodities, averaged 126.9 points last month against 129.7 for February, the agency said on Friday. It was the lowest reading since July 2021. 
A combination of ample supplies, subdued import demand and the extension of a deal allowing the safe export of Ukrainian grain via the Black Sea contributed to the drop, FAO said.
The Rome-based agency said the decline in the index reflected lower prices for cereals, vegetable oils and dairy products, which offset rises in sugar and meat prices.
“While prices dropped at the global level, they are still very high and continue to increase in domestic markets, posing additional challenges to food security,” Maximo Torero, FAO’s Chief Economist, said in a statement.
“This is particularly so in net food importing developing countries, with the situation aggravated by the depreciation of their currencies against the US dollar or the euro and a mounting debt burden,” he added.
The FAO cereal price index fell 5.6% month-on-month in March, with wheat registering a 7.1% drop, maize a 4.6% decline and rice easing 3.2%.

2,China’s Alibaba invites businesses to trial AI chatbot,Source confirmed that application was an LLM targeted at business users,"Tech giant Alibaba is seeking companies to test its Tongyi Qianwen AI chatbot, business publication STAR Market Daily reported on Friday, joining the rush to emulate the explosive success of ChatGPT.
The free-to-use ChatGPT, a large language model (LLM) application created by Microsoft-backed OpenAI, was released to the public last November and can generate articles and essays on demand in response to user prompts.
Alibaba has opened up registration for businesses to conduct testing for its AI application, STAR Market reported without specifying details.
A source close to the matter confirmed to Reuters that the application was an LLM targeted at business users.
Alibaba’s cloud computing division published a teaser on Friday, posting a message on social media simply stating: “Hello, my name is Tongyi Qianwen, this is our first time meeting, I welcome your feedback.”
The official website for the chatbot application merely has boxes to enter phone numbers and email addresses to request an invitation but provides no specific details about its exact use.
Alibaba Cloud did not respond immediately to an emailed request for comment.
A formal launch is expected at an Alibaba Cloud event on Tuesday. Daniel Zhang, CEO of Alibaba Group as well as the company’s cloud division, is scheduled to speak at the event.
Others to have joined the AI chatbot race include Baidu Inc, with its Ernie Bot application open only to trial users at the moment.
On Saturday network gear maker Huawei Technologies is due to stage an event unveiling Pangu, its natural language processing (NLP) AI model.
SenseTime is also holding an event next week to showcase “cutting-edge advancements in artificial intelligence software.”

3,Turkey seeks grain deal extension,Russia threatened to bypass UN-brokered deal unless obstacles to agri-exports removed,"Russia on Friday threatened to bypass the UN-brokered grain deal unless obstacles to its agricultural exports were removed, while talks in Turkey agreed removing barriers was a necessary condition to extending the agreement beyond next month.
The Black Sea grain deal, first signed last July and twice renewed, is an attempt by the United Nations to ease a food crisis that predated the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but has been made worse by the war.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov attending talks in Ankara said he and Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu discussed “a failure” to implement the terms of the deal.
He said Russia could work outside it if Western countries maintain what he said were obstacles to agricultural exports that were getting tougher.
The deal ensures safe passage of grains and other commodities from Ukrainian ports despite a Russian naval blockade.
Lavrov said that if the West did not want to be honest about what UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had sought to do with the deal, then Ukraine would have to use land and river routes to export.
“And we will work, if necessary, outside the framework of this initiative. We have the opportunity to do this with Turkey, with Qatar - the presidents discussed relevant plans,” Lavrov said.
Last month, Russia said it would extend the deal for another 60 days even though the UN, Ukraine and Turkey had pushed for a repeat 120-day rollover.
Alongside Lavrov, Cavusoglu told a news conference that Turkey was committed to extending the deal beyond mid-May.
“We attach importance to the continuation of the agreement...not only for Russia and Ukraine’s grain and fertiliser exports, but also for stopping the world food crisis,” Cavusoglu said.
“We also agree that the obstacles to the export of Russian grain and fertiliser should be removed. Issues need to be addressed for the grain deal to be extended further,” he said. 
Russia and Ukraine are two of the most important producers of agricultural commodities in the world.

4,Govt renews E&P licence to boost output,Also exempts Polish energy firm from relinquishing 10% licence area,"The government has renewed the exploration licence of a Polish energy firm for the second time in a bid to boost oil and gas production in the country.
It has also approved exemption from the condition of relinquishing 10% of licence area at the end of first licence renewal.
So far, the polish company has failed to kick off hydrocarbon exploration to meet the country’s growing energy demand. The government approved the renewal and granted exemption after the company approached it at the end of first renewal.
It is part of the government’s policy that oil and gas exploration and production (E&P) companies would have to relinquish 10% of licence area if they fail to begin exploration by the end of first renewal.
However, it exempted the Polish firm from the condition keeping in view the fact that the country was facing an oil and gas crisis and companies were even barred from opening Letters of Credit (LCs) for oil imports owing to the shortage of dollars.
Sources told The Express Tribune that the Petroleum Division had received an application from Polish Oil & Gas Company, seeking the second renewal for two years for Kirthar Exploration Licence Block 2,667-7 with the objective of boosting oil and gas production.
The division placed the request before the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet in a meeting held on March 30.
It told the ECC that the Directorate General of Petroleum Concessions (DGPC) had received a request from Polish Oil & Gas Company for entry into second two-year renewal of Kirthar exploration licence and exemption from the condition of Rule 21(4)c of Pakistan Petroleum (Exploration and Production) Rules 2001 to relinquish 10% of licence area at the end of first renewal.
Under the rules, discretionary powers for renewal rest with the government.
The company requested for the exemption as it wanted to further explore the area for potential prospects.
Petroleum Division told the ECC that the government, in accordance with Section 5 of the Regulation of Mines, Oilfields and Mineral Development (Government Control) Act 1948, may exempt the company from the applicability of Rule 21(4)c.
It pointed out that the case had been reviewed thoroughly taking into consideration geological complexities of the licence area, associated exploratory and operational risks, significance of geological and geophysical activities, security situation of the area, and payment of all government dues and guarantees.
A detailed evaluation of the request and recommendation of the regulator (DGPC) were shared with the cabinet body.
Petroleum Division requested the ECC to consider and approve the request of the company for entry into second two-year renewal of Kirthar exploration licence with effect from August 28, 2022 in accordance with Rule 21(2) of Pakistan Petroleum (Exploration and Production) Rules 2001, and grant exemption from the condition of Rule 21(4)c to relinquish 10% of licence area in accordance with Section 5 of the Regulation of Mines, Oilfields and Mineral Development (Government Control) Act 1948.
It would be “subject to the condition that the Polish energy company will drill an exploratory well up to the Pub Formation or up to the depth of 2,500 metres, whichever is shallower, during the second renewal period”.
The company will discharge/ clear all financial obligations like training, social welfare, rental for the extended period and any leftover obligations within a fortnight after the approval, the division said.
ECC considered a summary submitted by the Petroleum Division titled “Grant of Second Two Years’ Renewal over Kirthar Exploration Licence Block (2,667-7)” and approved the proposal.

5,"Despite increase in tariff, circular debt skyrockets to Rs2.6tr",Average per month increase during Jul-Feb FY22-23 was Rs52.4 billion,"The coalition government has added a net Rs419 billion to the power sector circular debt during the first eight months of this fiscal year, pushing the total circular debt to Rs2.67 trillion despite significantly increasing electricity prices last year.
The average per month increase in circular debt during the July-February period, of FY2022-23, was a colossal Rs52.4 billion, according to sources in the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Energy.
The stock of circular debt at the beginning of the fiscal year was Rs2.253 trillion, which mushroomed to Rs2.67 trillion, they added. As part of the condition set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, the coalition government increased electricity prices by Rs7.91 per unit in July last year. The move, however, failed to stem the growth of circular debt.
Sources said that the payables to power producers have jumped from Rs1.35 trillion in June last year to Rs1.8 trillion at the end of February –a surge of Rs456 billion or over one-third. But the stock of circular debt was reduced by Rs35 billion to Rs765 billion during the period under review. Another Rs99 billion was added on account of payables to fuel suppliers.
There have not been many efforts to reduce line losses and theft, which is also playing a significant role in increasing circular debt.
Of the Rs419 billion additions in circular debt, an increase of Rs232 billion, i.e., 55%, was because of inefficiency and losses by power distribution companies and lower recovery of bills. The government added Rs59 billion to circular debt on account of losses by power distribution companies. The low recovery of bills added Rs173 billion to circular debt during the July-February 2023 period.
Under the revised Circular Debt Management Plan, the Power Division had informed the IMF and World Bank that it would make monthly circular debt reports public aimed at ensuring transparency and tracking performance. However, the Power Division violated this commitment, apparently because of poor performance.
Last week, the Ministry of Finance gave subsidies worth Rs103 billion to partly lower the debt. The Rs103 billion unbudgeted subsidy is the first tranche of additional power subsidies worth Rs335 billion that Islamabad had agreed to pay under an understanding with the IMF in February, according to government sources.
For the current fiscal year, the government had budgeted Rs570 billion in power subsidies, which after a recent understanding with the IMF, will now surge to a minimum of Rs905 billion.
Power sector losses are on the rise despite a significant increase in prices. In February, the government approved increasing electricity prices again in the range of Rs3.3 to Rs15.52 per unit for residential consumers, farmers and exporters.
The revised circular debt management plan showed that despite a significant increase in prices, and an additional Rs335 billion subsidy, the circular debt stock will jump to Rs2.37 trillion by June this year. While comparing with end-February, the government has to reduce circular debt by Rs297 billion to achieve the upward revised target.
At the time of signing the $6 billion bailout package, the IMF had allowed Pakistan to add only Rs39 billion to circular debt during the July-December 2019 period, and from December onwards Pakistan was required to keep the flow zero – a goal that was not achieved by repeatedly increasing prices.
But the Ministry of Energy officials believed that the impact of increasing the electricity prices in the past eight months, including the fresh surge, would be fully reflected in the remaining period of the current fiscal year, which would help restrict the increase in debt.
Details showed that an amount of Rs105 billion was added to circular debt during the past eight months due to a delay in releasing the electricity subsidies.
A sum of Rs73 billion was added to circular debt due to payments of interest to power producers on delayed payments. The government now owes Rs1.8 trillion to these producers and its failure to make payments is adding more to the debt.
Another Rs35 billion was added to circular debt on account of payment of interest to banks on the Rs765 billion parked in a power holding company. The government has now imposed a Rs3.23 per unit debt servicing surcharge to address this issue –which is tantamount to passing on the cost of its inefficiency to power consumers.
Sources said that additions of Rs95 billion to circular debt were on account of delays in recovery of generation cost through quarterly and monthly fuel charges. The non-payment of K-Electric subsidies also added Rs119 billion to the debt stock. However, the accumulation of debt on these two counts might be partly addressed after a fresh increase in prices and the finance ministry’s commitment to providing Rs335 billion in additional subsidies.
Gross increase in circular debt was Rs659 billion in eight months but Rs240 billion were net-off through other means. This reduction was on account of partial payment of subsidies of Rs33 billion prior years’ recoveries of Rs140 billion, Rs65 billion principal repayments and Rs31 billion worth of stock payments, said the sources.

6,Survey shows -22% confidence score,90% of businesses surveyed believe country is headed in the wrong direction,"Pakistan’s business confidence has taken a significant hit due to the ongoing political and economic crises, according to the latest Gallup Business Confidence Index report. The report indicates that the situation has not improved in the first quarter of 2023, and 72% of the 520 businesses surveyed are worried about the country’s potential default. This has resulted in a lack of investment and growth, exacerbating economic challenges.
The survey is the ninth of a quarterly Business Confidence Survey by Gallup Pakistan, which is used by policymakers as a crucial barometer to capture the sentiments of the business community in any country. The report highlights that pessimism about the conditions and prospects of businesses has risen among owners, with last year’s political instability combining with various economic crises to exacerbate business insecurity.
Commenting on the survey, former member of the Prime Minister’s Economic Committee, Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri said, “The survey reveals that uncertainty breeds uncertainties. He adds that the current vicious cycle of uncertainties, which are mutually reinforcing and aggravating each other’s impact, is eroding business confidence. The political tug of war and the inconsistent approach to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program are leading to a trust deficit between the business community and the government and between the international community and the government.”
“The people of Pakistan are the direct victims of this situation,” he added.
The report shows that negative perceptions can change to positive with government policies that support business growth, such as rewarding innovation, investment, and business planning.
Speaking to the Express Tribune, Arif Habib Commodities CEO Ahsan Mehanti said, “Business confidence improves with the government’s will to help sustain.”
He added that the government’s policies that promote employment and productivity through incentives to businesses, including tax benefits, subsidies, and skill development, can help.
The report also highlights that inflation is the most cited problem that businesses would like the government to solve. Compared to the last quarter, 10% more businesses want the government to help with currency depreciation, but 7% fewer believe the government should provide relief on utility prices.
More than half of the surveyed businesses (57%) have not undergone layoffs in the last quarter, but 38% report a decrease in their workforce during this time. The report indicates that 66% of businesses perceive themselves as facing bad or worse conditions, with a 7% increase in businesses reporting very bad business conditions. Most business types reported the business being in a bad state, with a 50-50 split between good and bad conditions in the construction, cosmetics, and industrial machines and equipment sector.
Around 70% of businesses perceive bad conditions in Sindh and KPK, and 64% in Punjab. The report highlights that 61% of businesses in the first quarter of 2023 said future expectations are negative, while only 38% expect things to improve at all. The Net Future Business Confidence score has worsened by 11% since the previous quarter and is now at -22%.
Business community perceptions regarding the direction of the country remain consistent with the previous quarter, with 90% of businesses surveyed opining that the country is headed in the wrong direction.
President of United Business Group (UBG) Zubair Tufail said that, “In the current situation of the country, it is necessary to obtain a loan from the International Financial Institution, but depending on the IMF is not a permanent solution.”
He added that political chaos in the country is having a serious negative impact on business and the life of the general public. Due to the lack of political stability, investors and industrialists are facing an uncertain situation.
Gallup Pakistan, Executive Director, Bilal Ijaz Gilani says businesses in Pakistan are faced with multiple calamities, including decades-high inflation killing consumer purchasing power, an absolute lack of stability in the political system causing an environment of uncertainty and mistrust, and poor economic policies leading to a lack of investment and growth.
“In the past many decades of reading the pulse of the Pakistani business community, we have not seen such dire times being reported,” he said.
He emphasised the need for the government to take bold steps to improve the situation, including implementing policies that support business growth and addressing the concerns raised by the business community.
The Gallup Business Confidence Index report highlights the deepening economic and political crises in Pakistan and the resulting negative impact on business confidence. 
The report underscores the need for the government to take immediate steps to address the concerns of the business community, including implementing policies that support business growth, promoting employment and productivity through incentives, and addressing inflation and currency depreciation. Failure to do so will only exacerbate the country’s economic challenges and hinder its ability to attract investment and create jobs.
