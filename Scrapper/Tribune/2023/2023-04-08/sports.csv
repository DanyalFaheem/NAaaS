0,Youth back from India after 16-month incarceration,Mandi Bahauddin resident had crossed Narowal border,"A youth who had mistakenly crossed the border has returned home following his release after spending 16 months in an Indian jail.
Zulqarnain Zafar of Mandi Bahauddin had mistakenly crossed the Pakistan-India border from Narowal in November 2021.
The Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi strived for his release through communication with the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs.
Indian authorities handed over Zafar to Punjab Rangers at the Wagah border. 
His travel documents were provided by the Pakistan high commission. 
According to sources, Zafar thanked the authorities of both Pakistan and India, saying he was happy that he would be able to celebrate the coming Eid with his parents. 

There is an agreement between Pakistan and India to return within three days those people who cross the border by mistake, but the security agencies of both sides sometimes take years to release them due to verification of the citizenship and investigation. There are many prisoners in the jails of both countries who had crossed the border by mistake.
The two countries exchanged the details of the prisoners on January 1.
According to the Foreign Office, there were 705 Indian prisoners in Pakistan, including 654 fishermen, while the number of Pakistanis in Indian jails was 434, including 95 fishermen. 
Pakistan has repeatedly demanded that those Pakistani citizens whose sentences have been completed in India and citizenship confirmed should be released immediately.

1,ACE to amend investigation rules,Any accused or complainant to be able to move an application impacting the investigations at any stage of the process,"The Punjab Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) has started work to amend its rules regarding the investigation process.
ACE Director General Sohail Zaffar Chatha shared with journalists on Thursday that any accused or complainant could move an application having an impact on the investigations at any stage of the process. He added that in cases registered in the ACE, an amendment to an application could be requested anytime. 
The official said a standing order would soon be issued for updating the process. He lamented that the conviction rate in the ACE cases was less than one per cent.
Chatha said he had held a meeting with NAB about the cases of alleged corruption of up to Rs500 million. After a constitutional amendment, the scope of the NAB investigations has been slashed to cases of over Rs500 million.
He added that since the investigations into scams of up to Rs500 million had fallen into the ACE's purview, it had created a pressure of workload on the establishment.

2,PTI leader’s bail extended,Court directs all accused to appear before JIT,"An Anti-Terrorism Court judge on Friday extended the bail of several PTI leaders, including former federal minister Asad Umar in the Zaman Park law and order case until April 27.
The judge directed them to appear before the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) for further investigation.
The PTI leaders, including Asad Umar, Mian Aslam Iqbal, Dr Yasmeer Rashid, Zubair Niazi, Hassan Niazi, and others, were accused of attacking police officials, creating law and order problems, causing panic and setting state properties on fire at Zaman Park.
During the proceedings, the JIT head, SSP Imran Kishwar, informed the court that only Asad Umar had joined the investigation, while the other accused had not appeared before the JIT. The judge directed all the accused to join the investigation before the JIT, to which the JIT head suggested that the accused could visit their office.
The counsel for the accused contended that the accused could join the investigation on the court premises. The judge adjourned the proceedings until 10:00 am and directed the JIT head to record the statements of the accused persons in the court premises.
When the proceedings resumed, the JIT head informed the court that all accused appearing before the JIT had recorded their statements, and they needed to put some queries to the accused persons in the presence of witnesses. The ATC judge directed the accused persons to appear before the JIT at 2:30 pm on April 7, 2023.

3,Billboards evoke road safety concerns,"Excessive brightness, frequent image changes among other factors, distract drivers","As the country strives to match the developmental expectations of urbanisation, in a world increasingly hegemonized by consumer capitalism, a failure to regulate the placement and operation of digital billboards, unravels a new road hazard.
In its relentless efforts to generate much needed revenue, the provincial government has haphazardly undertaken the task of installing digital billboards at various green belt junctions in the city, without devising proper regulations and guidelines - which are indispensable in reducing distracted driving and subsequent accidents.
“The past few years have witnessed a sporadic rise in the number of digital billboards in Lahore with numerous big enterprises moving to computerised advertising,” informed Sharjeel Ahmed, an advertiser. “However, unlike developed countries, no specific regulations exist, which monitor the placement and operation of these billboards,” he added.
According to on-ground survey by The Express Tribune, multiple, kilometre long installations of countless digital billboards across the green belt have sprung up in areas like Allama Iqbal Town, Defence Housing Authority (DHA), Gulberg, Johar Town and Model Town, albeit without any regulations determining their level of brightness and image change frequency; which is crucial to prevent road mishaps.
Where most developed countries like the United Kingdom (UK) clearly specify the permitted level of luminance, rate of change of images and font and placement of the digital billboards, for the ones in Pakistan, such standards of advertisement regulation do not exist.
With a majority of the billboards excessively bright, drivers are posed with an increasing risk of distraction since the strong flashes of beaming light strains their eyes, thus diverting their attention from the road for far longer than would be considered safe.
Ehtisham Sadiq, a driver with an implanted eye, while talking to The Express Tribune expressed his annoyance with the billboards. “With my vision already compromised, the bright glare of the consecutive digital billboards, playing the same visuals over and over, puts immense tension on my eyes, making it extremely challenging for me to focus on my driving.”
Others similarly complained that the high frequency of changes in the advertisements and their small font size further contributes towards the degree of distraction that drivers are faced with since most struggle to read or watch the advertisements.
“Digital billboards, the world over, are meant to draw the attention of the drivers, however how much attention they draw, must be regulated by the authorities so that any possible road hazard could be minimised,” suggested Bushra Shahid, a driving school instructor.
Concurring with Bushra’s judgement, Khalid Majeed, a retired professor, shared his own experience of road accidents due to unregulated digital billboards. “I have had a fender bender many times just because the driver was visibly lost in the overly bright, quickly changing digital advertisements,” he said.
In his response to the complaints of the citizens posited by The Express Tribune, Director of Marketing at the Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA), Muhammad Usman conceded that the PHA had not devised proper technical rules and regulations for the operation of the billboards, in terms of their brightness, change frequency and font size. “However, certain standards have been set by the Outdoor Advertising Association Lahore,” he added quickly.
When asked about these standards, Adyan Sadiq Lone, Chairman of the Outdoor Advertising Association Lahore, replied that a maximum of eight advertisements can run continuously, whereas the hoardings are shut down every four hours. “Digital hoardings are a modern mode of marketing and are no more a risk to drivers than are mobile phones,” added Lone, matter-of-factly while talking to The Express Tribune.

Upon receiving the information, police reached the spot and shifted the body to the DHQ Hospital, where it was confirmed that the corpse was three days old. 
Police have registered a case and opened their investigation. In the month of July 2020, a decapitated body of a girl was found in Pul Dangro Canal.
Local people had informed the police after seeing the body of the girl aged about 25 floating in Pul Dangro Canal in Nishatabad. 
Police had pulled the body out of the canal and discovered that it did not have a head. The head had been chopped off by unidentified persons with a sharp tool, and the body had been thrown into the canal.
A number of cases of murders of unidentified men and women by unknown assailants and dumping of bodies in the canals have been reported in the past.
The bodies of 67 people were recovered from the canals in the period from 2014 to 2020.
Also in 2020, body of an unidentified woman was recovered from the canal in Jaranwala.
Rescuers took the body out of the canal and informed the police. Reportedly, the citizens were in a state of panic over the incidents of bodies being recovered from canals in Jaranwala and its environs.
