0,President returns bill limiting CJ's powers to parliament,Alvi says can be assailed as a ‘colourable legislation’,"President Dr Arif Alvi on Saturday returned the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Bill, 2023 – which aims to curtail the powers of the chief justice of Pakistan to take suo motu notice and constitute benches on his own – to the Parliament for reconsideration.
The federal cabinet had requested 
that the president immediately sign the bill, in an effort to resolve the country's constitutional and political crisis.
The bill, which has already been approved by the National Assembly and Senate, was passed in the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s decision to order elections in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa within 90 days of their dissolution, among other such decisions.
According to a statement issued from the president’s secretariat, President Alvi returned the bill “as per the provisions of Article 75 of the Constitution”, adding that “the bill prima facie travels beyond the competence of parliament and can be assailed as a colourable legislation”.
However, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the return of Supreme Court bill duly passed by the Parliament was most unfortunate.

In a tweet on social media platform Twitter, he said, “President Alvi returning the Supreme Court Bill duly passed by Parliament is most unfortunate. Through his conduct, he has belittled the august Office by acting as a worker of the PTI, one who is beholden to Imran Niazi more than the Constitution & demands of his Office.”
“The president said that he thought it fit and proper to return the bill, in accordance with the Constitution, with the request for reconsideration in order to meet the scrutiny about its validity (if assailed in the Court of Law)”.
The president, after “an in-depth consideration” of the bill, listed aspects that required consideration “to provide for the practice and procedure of the Supreme Court of Pakistan”.
He stated that “Article 191 of the Constitution empowers the Supreme Court ‘to make rules regulating the practice and procedure of the court’”, and that “under such enabling provisions of the Constitution, the Supreme Court Rules 1980 have been made and in force duly validated and adopted by the Constitution itself”.
He continued that “these time-tested Rules were being followed ever since the year 1980 – any tinkering with the same may tantamount to interference with the internal working of the Court, its autonomy and independence”.
The president’s second reasoning was that the Constitution was “founded on the concept of trichotomy of power – three pillars of the State whose domain of power, authority and functions are defined and delineated by the Constitution itself”.
“Parliament has also been given the power under Article 67 that states “subject to the Constitution, a House may make rules for regulating its procedure and the conduct of its business….”. Article 191 states that “subject to the Constitution and law, the Supreme Court may make rules regulating the practice and procedure of the Court”.”
He highlighted that Articles 67 and 191 were akin to each other and recognize the autonomy and independence of each other respectively – barring interference of one into the other’s domain.
Alvi furthered that the SC was “an independent institution as visualized by the founding fathers that in the State of Pakistan ‘independence of judiciary shall be fully secured’'.
He continued that with such an objective in view, “Article 191 was incorporated and the Supreme Court was kept out of the law-making authority of the Parliament”.
According to the president, “the competence of parliament to make laws stems from the Constitution itself. Article 70 relates to ‘introduction and passing of Bills’ with respect to any matter in the Federal Legislative List – enumerated in the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution”.
“Followed and further affirmed are the provisions of Article 142(a) that Parliament can make laws ‘with respect to any matter in the Federal Legislative List’. Entry 55 of Part I of the Fourth Schedule while empowering the Parliament to make laws in respect of ‘jurisdiction and powers of all courts except the Supreme Court’ especially excluded the Supreme Court.”
He emphasised that the bill, “prima-facie travels beyond the competence of the Parliament and can be assailed as a colourable legislation”.
The president maintained that “the idea may be laudable” but questioned if “such a purpose” could be achieved “without amending the provisions of relevant Articles of the Constitution”.
He added that the established law is that the provisions of the Constitution “cannot be amended by an ordinary law as the Constitution is a higher law – father of laws – a Constitution is not an ordinary law, but rather an embodiment of fundamental principles, higher law, and law above other laws”.

1,Dar blames ‘crises’ at home for skipping US trip,Minister says PM instructed him not go to Washington to attend WB-IMF meetings,"Finance Minister Ishaq Dar on Saturday said that Pakistan was waiting for the confirmation of $1 billion loan from a friendly country to meet a condition of the International Monetary Fund, as the government keeps dodging sovereign default through currency flow management.
Dar addressed the nation to give his stance on the decision to cancel a trip to the United States, which The Express Tribune had reported on Friday.

The minister said that he had to cancel his visit to Washington where he was scheduled to attend the World Bank-IMF spring meetings due to the prevailing “constitutional crisis” in the country.
“On the instructions of the prime minister, I have cancelled the US visit but will virtually attend the meetings where Pakistan’s participation is required,” he said. He termed the mandatory the WB-IMF meetings as “routine rituals” where long speeches are made.
Dar was scheduled to meet the deputy managing director of the IMF, Miss Antoinette Sayeh, the IMF’s director for Central Asia and Middle East, Jihad Azhor, and Mission Chief to Pakistan Nathan Porter. However, the government could not secure a meeting with the IMF managing director.
While commenting on the delay in reaching a staff level agreement with the IMF, the finance minister said that Pakistan had already done all that was required to conclude the ninth review.
The minister said that at the time of the seventh and eight reviews, two friendly countries (Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates) had informed the IMF in writing about providing $3 billion loans to Pakistan.
“The two-month delay from mid-February was due to this reason,” he said. “In the past two weeks, one of our friendly countries (Saudi Arabia) has given the confirmation to the IMF of the $2 billion loan.”

“We are now waiting for the confirmation of $1 billion loan from one friendly country” (the UAE),” said the finance minister. He said that that would help meet all the prior actions for the staff level agreement and it would take another two weeks to take the matter to the IMF board.
Pakistan and the IMF had agreed on a $6 billion external financing gap to be bridged through a combination of bilateral, commercial and programme loans. However, so far except for a commitment from Saudi Arabian, there is still a gap of $4 billion.
The country’s gross official reserves have slipped to $4.2 billion even after $1.7 billion Chinese injection. The government is avoiding the default by restricting outbound flow of the foreign currency to the extent of inward flows on account of exports, remittances and some loans.
But this is creating a huge backlog in the shape of nonpayment of dividends, in addition to causing a shortage of essential imported goods and raw materials that will require billions of dollars in future to make up for the shortfall.
Dar said that despite the worst of the liquidity crisis, the country did not delay its global sovereign payments of $11 billion.
Dar also acknowledged that the IMF had questioned the government’s decision to give petrol subsidy, saying that he has answers to all the questions. The minister added that the subsidy involved charging the affluent more and providing that amount to the underprivileged in shape of relief (subsidy), adding that it had nothing to do with the budget.
However, IMF Resident Representative Miss Esther Perez had told The Express Tribune that the IMF would encourage targeted subsidies and sought greater details from Pakistan “in terms of its operation, cost, targeting, protections against fraud and abuse and any offsetting measures”.
Dar once again blamed the IMF for the delay in starting the programme review talks. “When I went to the IMF with my delegation in October 2022, I invited them to Pakistan for the ninth review, which is technically the September 2022 review and for unknown reasons, they finally came to Pakistan in January 2023.”
Skipping US trip
The finance minister said that he canceled the US trip because of the “prevailing constitutional crisis” and the Supreme Court’s orders to the federal government to give Rs21 billion for the election in Punjab by April 10, implying that the money thus saved would contribute towards holding the polls to the two provincial assemblies.
“Due to these circumstances and on the prime minister’s directives, I have dropped my plan to visit Washington. The minister said that it was not unusual and he would virtually participate in meetings where his participation was needed.
“It is astonishing that some are saying that I was told not to go by the IMF. The IMF cannot tell me not to attend. Pakistan is a member of the World Bank and the IMF. It is not a beggar,” he said.
He accused some analysts of twisting the facts. “Someone is writing that I did not get the meetings I wanted. Someone else is suggesting that I should have ignored the domestic crisis and gone anyway,” he said.

2,SFD inks $240m accord for Mohmand dam,"Dam project aligns with sustainable development goals of ensuring food security, clean water, and clean energy","The Saudi Fund for Development (SFD) has signed a $240 million loan agreement to finance the Mohmand dam project, a major hydropower complex that will contribute to Pakistan’s energy security, increase sustainable water supply for agriculture and human consumption as well as improve resilience to floods.
The agreement was signed by the SFD CEO Sultan Abdulrahman Al-Marshad and the Federal Secretary for Ministry of Economic Affairs Dr Kazim Niaz.
Ambassador of Saudi Arabia Nawaf bin Said Al-Malki witnessed the signing ceremony.
This loan will help bridge the financing gap and contribute in promoting and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), according to the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
The Mohmand multipurpose dam project will enhance water and food security, and improve the standard of living for the people of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, where almost 80% of the population resides in rural areas, boosting the region's socioeconomic development by creating employment opportunities and reducing poverty levels.
The project aligns with sustainable development goals of ensuring food security, clean water, and clean energy.
The project, which is co-financed by the SFD, OPEC, Islamic Development Bank, and the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, is expected to have a significant impact on Pakistan's energy and water sectors.
By using renewable energy sources, the project will generate 800MW of electricity, contributing to Pakistan's energy security.
During the agreement signing ceremony, the SFD CEO emphasised the strong developmental ties between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.
The CEO also highlighted the significance of joint cooperation between development funds, as evidenced by this project. He further emphasised that this initiative was an extension of the SFD's continued support for development projects and programmes in Pakistan since its inception.
The SFD financed around 41 development projects and programmes in Pakistan, amounting to approximately $1.4 billion.
In addition, the SFD financed oil derivatives worth more than $5.4 billion between 2019 and 2023 to support Pakistan's economy. This came as a continuation of the support provided by the government of Saudi Arabia to the brotherly country Pakistan to build a sustainable economy, the ministry stated.
Niaz recognised the significant contribution made by the kingdom towards financing the vital project, emphasising its importance in bringing about positive developmental impacts on Pakistan and its people.
The use of renewable energy would enable sustainable energy as well as water sources, which would enhance water and food security.

3,"Judiciary, executive trying to cool frayed tempers",Govt willing to hold talks with PTI but it doesn’t trust Imran,"Despite harsh political statements, backchannel contacts are still open between the judiciary and executive to ease the tensions, which have arisen after the Supreme Court’s decision to hold the elections in Punjab on May 14.
The federal government is also seriously evaluating the PTI leaders' desire to initiate negotiations on national issues, especially the conducting of the general elections.
The government has no hesitation to talk with the PTI on every matter but the real issue is that it completely lacks trust in party chief Imran Khan with his past record of backtracking from his commitments.
“Who will give the guarantee for his [Imran’s] future conduct”? a cabinet member told The Express Tribune.
Another leader commenting on the prevailing political situation said there were serious apprehensions among all segments of the society including the judiciary, establishment, media, etc that whenever the PTI chief would come into power, he would target them.
“Therefore, Imran should come forward and end this impression,” he added.
Sources told The Express Tribune that despite the SC ruling, the superior judiciary, led by Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial, still wanted that a dialogue should be initiated between political parties on the issue of elections.
Earlier during the hearing of the case, the CJP had urged political stakeholders to sit together to reach a consensus.
CJP Bandial is among those judges, who have never initiated contempt proceedings against political leaders or media personnel during their careers.
Therefore, it is unlikely that he -- following in the footsteps of ex-CJP Saqib Nisar and other former top judges -- would issue contempt notices to PML-N leaders, who are accusing him of being biased and a pro-PTI judge.
However, legal experts agree that the elections issue was poorly mishandled and that is why SC judges themselves are raising their voice over the judicial proceedings in the matter.
Questions are being raised on the legitimacy of court rulings.
It is learnt that the government might announce starting a dialogue with the PTI in the next couple of days.
Another ruling party, the PPP, also wants talks to be initiated on the elections issue with the opposition.
Despite the constitutional requirement of holding elections within 90 days, there is a realisation among all stakeholders that the polls for the National and provincial assemblies should be held on one date.
It is learnt that the security establishment has turned down the request to provide armed personnel for the provision of security for elections for the provincial and National assemblies if they were held separately.
The apex court is also facing a serious crisis as judges are divided into two camps.
There is need for the CJP -- being the head of the institution -- to take practical steps to end the mistrust between fellow judges.
The sources said the temperature was high in both camps of the SC judges.
Political analysts say that a dialogue within a “divided” SC is more important than negotiations between political rivals.
However, they agree if the temperature ‘outside' cools down, the situation may also change inside the apex court.
A lawyer, who is well-connected with both camps, revealed that there was realisation among some members on the two sides that the SC’s moral authority was being eroded on account of differences between judges.
