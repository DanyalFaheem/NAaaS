1,Groundwater fast depleting in garrison city,Illegal hydrants continue to extract water as admin turns blind eye to illegality,"The groundwater level in Rawalpindi city and Cantonment has rapidly been depleting due to activities of illegal water hydrants.
The groundwater level has fallen to almost 700 feet from 600 feet a year ago.
The sale of water to residents through illegal hydrants hooked into dozens of illegal tube wells in various areas including on the banks of Swan River in Rawalpindi has been going on with impunity as the local administration has turned a blind eye to the blatant violation and illegality.
An official warned that millions of borings and wells were likely to be dried up in the summer as there was not enough water in reservoirs and dams supplying water to the twin cities.
The WASA senior officer said that the illegal business of water was growing with an alarming proportion in Rawalpindi. The administration and related institutions seemed to look helpless before the water mafia.
Private tankers continue to sell water from these hydrants to new housing societies in the city and Cantonment areas around the clock with per tanker costing up to Rs6,000, depending on the distance from the illegal hydrants to the intended area.
Surprisingly, dozens of transformers have also been installed near these hydrants to supply uninterrupted electricity to the illegal hydrants connected to tube wells.
Illegal hydrants have been installed in Cantonment areas, suburbs and on the bank of River Swan, from where water is being supplied further in tankers.
Citizens of the garrison city were compelled to purchase tanker water at exorbitant costs.
The official said that the illegal water business was ongoing with impunity in areas such as Chakri Road, Adiala Road, Girja Road, Misryal Road, Chakra, Sadiq Abad, Gulzar E Quaid, Dhamyal, Dhok Syeddan, Dhok Chauhdrian, People’s Colony, Tench, Harley Street, Lal Kurti, Tali Mohrri and other areas.
The WASA official further said that the launching of new water schemes was the only solution to get rid of the water mafia and illegal hydrants. He said that the government of Punjab should focus on the construction of small dams including the Dadocha Dam in Rawalpindi.
Although the government claims to own the underground water reserves, in reality, the tanker mafia makes a profitable business through these illegal hydrants.
Starting from the banks of the Swan River, the network of this illegal business extends to areas as far as Morgah, Gulraiz, Gulistan Colony, Lalazar and adjoining private housing societies in city and Cantonment areas.
Owing to the illegal extraction of water, underground water reserves are rapidly tumbling. Citizens are compelled to buy the commodity at an exorbitant price as the government has failed to ensure water supply through its networks.
All allied departments including the Water and Sanitation Agency seem to be helpless in front of the influential tanker mafia connected to the illegal business.
The citizens, who are already suffering from hyperinflation, have demanded of the authorities concerned that they should be supplied water through government networks to get rid of buying the basic commodity at an unaffordable and high price.
Residents of Gulistan Colony, Jahangir Shah, Malik Javed, Tanveer Shah, Khuram, Raja Basharat, Aijaz Shah and others said that there is a severe shortage of water in their area. They also said that the Chaklala Cantonment Board has also failed to ensure water supply to various areas in its jurisdiction, forcing residents to buy water from private tankers at a high cost.

6,Tailors reaping windfall profits ahead of Eid,"Inflation, high stitching rates open new windows for home-based seamstresses","With a handful of days left in Eidul Fitr, tailors in the garrison city have begun basking in profit’s sun due to an overwhelming demand for stitching Eid outfits on time.
Making hay over the customers’ quandaries, tailors of Rawalpindi have raised rates for stitching gents’, ladies’, and children's suits. On Friday, a majority of tailors announced that they have stopped taking new orders to deal with existing ones.
On the other hand, the tailors have hired more workers and begun stitching clothes around the clock to meet the demand. Separate teams for day and night shifts have also been formed while some tailors have started outsourcing new orders. The trend has created a golden opportunity for home-based tailors, especially women, to earn additional income.
Moreover, youngsters who have been employed for the job of buttoning clothes are making Rs100 per suit.
According to a survey, the charges for sewing men's suits have been increased from Rs1,000 to Rs1,300, while well-known tailors in major markets have raised their charges from Rs1,400 to Rs1,500. The cost to stitch ladies' suits has been fixed at Rs1,200 and the cost to stitch women's suits with a design on order has jumped to Rs1,500.
Similarly, the tailors are charging Rs1,100 to Rs1,200 for children’s suits.
The rise in demand for sewing clothes has created an opportunity for home-based seamstresses who are now generating money from the comfort of their homes.
Due to high rates and skyrocketing inflation, clients are increasingly relying on home-based seamstresses who get the job done at relatively low prices.
These housewives charge Rs1,200 per women's suit and Rs1,000 per men's suit.
Following the tailors' decision to stop taking additional orders, the sale of unstitched suits in the open market has begun to decline after the first 15 days of the holy month of Ramazan. The historic high inflation is also being blamed for the drop in sales.
Moreover, sources said tailors who are accepting new orders are now charging an additional Rs300 for custom-made suits.
Tailors have said that they will accept new orders till the 20th of Ramazan with an additional Rs300 and after that, the additional amount will be increased to Rs500.
According to the Rawalpindi Tailors Association Secretary General Wajid Ali, the total number of registered tailors in the city and Cantt of Rawalpindi is approximately 9,792.
Each tailor has received 200 to 350 suits as Eidul Fitr and Eidul Adha is the time when people associated with the profession earn extra money, he said.
“The cost of buckram has jumped by 300pc as have the expenses of labor and suit buttons”.
The cost of everything has gone up and it is now impossible to stitch a suit for Rs1,000, he added.
“We have issued strict instructions to all members to complete the orders and hand them over to the customers before Eid eve.
This year, a normal quality men's suit is being sold at Rs1,500, a medium quality suit between Rs2,000 and Rs2,500, and a good quality suit is being sold at Rs3,500 to Rs4,500.

9,Imran’s nephew handed over to Quetta police,"Vandalism, rioting case against PTI activists shifted to CTD","A district and sessions court in Islamabad on Friday approved a one-day transit remand of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan’s nephew and focal person Hassaan Khan Niazi to the Quetta police.
After the transit remand was approved, Quetta police took Niazi to Balochistan.
Sources said that a case had been registered against Hassan Niazi at the Airport police station in Quetta for inciting violence and interfering in government affairs.
Quetta police reached the district and session courts in Islamabad to arrest Hassan Niazi. Judicial Magistrate Abbas Shah issued a warrant for Hassan Niazi's arrest. Later, Hassan Niazi was presented in court. Quetta police requested a one-day physical remand of Hassan Niazi, which the judicial magistrate accepted. After which, he was handed over to Quetta police.
The court told the Quetta police's investigation officer to present Hassan Niazi in the relevant court on March 25.
On March 18, a case was filed against Hassan Niazi at the Quetta Airport police station on charges of inciting violence and interfering with police affairs on a complaint of Inspector Abdulllah of the Airport police station in Quetta.
The case stated that while on patrol, the sub-inspector got the information that 150 people had blocked Chaman Road in Quetta, including Inayatullah Kakar and others. 
The demonstrators blocked the road for one hour despite police’s attempt to disperse them. It should be noted that Hassan Niazi was not nominated in the FIR by the Quetta police.
Quetta police took custody of Hassan Khan Niazi and left for Balochistan after the judicial magistrate in Islamabad approved a one-day transit remand.
Niazi was taken into custody by police outside the Judicial Complex in Islamabad on Monday for his involvement in attacking law enforcement personnel and causing chaos in the federal capital. The arrest is part of an ongoing crackdown on PTI activists and supporters who police claim assaulted law enforcers while they were performing their duties in Islamabad.
On Thursday, the district and sessions court in Islamabad sent Hassan Niazi to jail on a 14-day judicial remand in a case related to clashes between PTI workers and Islamabad police outside the Federal Judicial Complex during the court appearance of the former prime minister in the Toshakhana case.
The local court had rejected the police’s plea seeking further physical remand of Hassan Niazi as the police failed to recover anything from the suspect during the investigation after taking him into custody.
Hassan Niazi was arrested in a separate case as he was leaving the Federal Judicial Complex after obtaining pre-arrest bail in three cases.
On Thursday, Hassan Niazi was produced in the court of Duty Magistrate Mureed Abbas in District and Sessions Court Islamabad after the expiry of his two-day physical remand.
The investigating officer pleaded to the court to grant a further five-day physical remand of Hassan Niazi. The investigating officer said that the co-accused has been identified while Hasan Niazi's arms and vehicle were to be recovered.
The PTI lawyers said that more than 72 hours had passed since his arrest but the police could not recover the (said) weapon.
The PTI counsel raised the question that if the arms and vehicle were not in possession of the police, then why have they detained Hassan Niazi?
Lawyer Faisal Chaudhry said that the police failed to trace the vehicle and its owner in the last 72 hours. He said that Hassan Niazi is a professional lawyer and he obtained three bails on the day of his arrest.
After hearing the arguments of the parties, Duty Magistrate Mureed Abbas reserved the verdict on the plea for the extension in the physical remand of Hassan Niazi. Later, the court announced the reserved verdict, rejecting the police plea for further physical remand of Hassan Niazi. The court issued an order to send him to jail on a 14-day judicial remand.
