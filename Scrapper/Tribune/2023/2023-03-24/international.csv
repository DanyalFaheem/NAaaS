2,"‘Almost 1,400 women die during childbirth each month’","'The population bulge if not taken seriously, will destroy us all'","The repeated pregnancies weaken the health of a mother and without proper family planning; her life is always at risk.
The health experts in a penal discussion titled ‘Maternal and Child Health issues in Pakistan: Challenges and opportunities’, urged the youth to be aware about the reproductive health and its impact on the future of Pakistan.
“About 1,400 women die during the pregnancies each month in Pakistan,” said Greenstar Social Marketing head Dr Syed Azizur Rab. He said that total 2.8 million miscarriages were reported yearly in the country. “Out of 10 million pregnancies reported at hospitals each year, four million are unwanted pregnancies,” he highlighted.
“The population bulge if not taken seriously, will destroy us all,” Dr Rab warned, saying there was a dire need of academic research on the issue.
Dr Talib Lashari of Sindh government’s population department said, “there is a law to prevent early child marriage and the provincial government is working hard to empower women.” He urged the newly married couples to have better family planning for prosperous future.
Gynecologist Dr Sadiah Ahsan Pal was of the view that Sindh is doing better than other provinces in terms of maternal care. “We have laws and that only can be implemented through the education.”
Dr Saba Shuja, another panelist, said that about 50 per cent girls were anemic in Pakistan, saying one of the major reasons of mortality was because of malnourishment. “Finding food for mothers is a challenge not the health [facilities],” she pointed out.
“We need to give them [girls and women] job opportunities,” said Sheena Hadi, the executive director of Aahung.

3,Airport gets facial recognition technology,System will be run on trial basis to screen suspected and wanted individuals,"Cameras installed at the Jinnah International Airport equipped with facial recognition technology have been made operational, with the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to manage it jointly. 
The surveillance system, equipped with Japanese technology, will help match criminals and suspects in its database using facial recognition. A control room has been set up to monitor passengers round the clock. 
Initially, the system will be run on a trial basis to screen suspected and wanted individuals. It includes high resolution cameras in the lounges of Jinnah Internation Airport to monitor the passenger traffic.
In the first phase, the FIA data will be added to it, said FIA Additional Director Abdul Salam Sheikh. After that, the data obtained from the police will be entered in the system along with images.
According to FIA Immigration Deputy Director Ali Murad, where the pictures of every person entering the terminal building will be captured and saved in the monitoring room. The system is also capable of making blurred images recognisable by up to 60 per cent. 
Murad said that image of the suspect or wanted person will be displayed in the monitoring room. “It will help in apprehending suspects and proclaimed offenders while reduce the turnaround time.”
He said that this technology would also ensure that people wanted here are unable to escape abroad.

4,Police arrest two over Thatta ‘honour killing’,Sahiba Chandio was 'strangled' and buried secretly,"Police have arrested two people for strangulating a woman on pretext of so called 'honour killing' in Thatta district.
Sahiba Chandio was killed and buried by her relatives in the Sakro area of Thatta recently. The village was abuzz with news that Sahiba did not die of natural causes. Instead, she was murdered due to 'karo kari' and buried in secrecy.
Thatta SSP Adeel Chandio taking notice of the news ordered Sakro police station SHO Gul Hasan Kachar to investigate the matter.
Subsequently, police claimed that Sahiba was killed by her two relatives Muhammad Chandio and Jan Muhammad Chandio. They had choked her to death and buried her at Shah Ismail Graveyard.
Police have arrested Muhamamd and Jan Muhammad under murder charges with the state as complainant. Despite efforts to root it out, the primitive practice of karo kari remains widespread in Sindh as well as other parts of the country. According to one study, at least 176 people were killed in Sindh in such killings in 2021. The majority of the victims are women.

5,Night routes of buses dwindle,Multiple issues plague Karachi’s public transport made worse by provincial government’s incompetence,"Over a decade ago, getting around in Karachi in the dead of the night was considerably easy as multiple bus services would ply the port city’s roads but not anymore.
During the last 15 years, owing to factors like the rise of illegal rickshaws, high cost of diesel, and an increase in street crime, around 380 public transport routes have been closed in the city, as per a survey conducted by The Express Tribune. Among the routes that were discontinued, a significant number were used by public transport vehicles which would operate until 3am. At that time, the vehicles on the popular W-11 route would run round the clock.
Presently, only one or two buses operate until 2am on the D-7 route. Vehicles on the popular W-11 route offer their services until 11pm.
Amir Raza, who drives a bus on the W-11 route, when asked about route closures and the lack of public transport at night, replied: “Some 280 vehicles used to ply the W-11 route round the clock until 2005. After that the public transport system went downhill.” 
When asked about the reasons for the decline, Raza said that sky-high diesel prices, illegal Qingqi (pronounced chinchi locally) rickshaws operating on the same route, and a string of robberies in the buses resulted in transporters of the route going out of business.
Consequently, the W-11 route’s reputation as a reliable night-time route was ruined and now only about 80 vehicles operate on it, Raza continued.
The lower number of vehicles and operations closing early means that night shift workers like Najma Ahmed struggle to find a ride home. “My shift ends at 3am. In the past, I would use the buses which operated on the W-11 route. But now, I either have to take an expensive cab or wait for other nurses to get free so we can carpool,” lamented Ahmed, who works as a nurse at the Civil Hospital in downtown Karachi.
It warrants mention that The Express Tribune’s survey implies that the closure of routes and subsequent decline in number of transporters impacts many more like Ahmed. The survey reveals that for a city, whose headcount is upward of 17 million, the number of public transport vehicles is incredibly low. 
Private transporters operate about 3,000 to 4,000 buses, minibuses, and coaches. The government owned People’s Bus Service operates 200 vehicles. Eighty buses operate under the Green Line Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and 20 buses are run on the Orange Line BRT.
Commenting on the dearth of public transport vehicles and routes for one of the most populated cities in the world, an emphatic Irshad Bukhari, the president of Karachi Transport Ittehad, held the Sindh government responsible. “This governance failure is evidenced by the traffic police’s failure to get illegal rickshaws off the roads. Moreover, the incompetence of the government in building infrastructure has also dented the public transport system,” remarked Bukhari.
Abdul Haleem Shaikh, the secretary at the transport department, does not agree with Bukhari’s assessment. “The government is currently running the cheapest bus service in the province,” he claimed.
When quizzed about the lack of night-time routes, Shaikh retorted that the number of passengers late in the night was minimal. “Hence operating the buses at that time is not feasible,” he justified. 
The Express Tribune also questioned the secretary about the dearth of buses for the city’s ever-increasing population. “The Red Line BRT project is under construction and will be a game changer for the city’s people,” he promised.

6,No injuries in pink bus accident,There were very few people on the bus and very few vehicles on the road.,"No major injury was reported as a vehicle of the provincial government’s Pink Bus Service fleet was in an accident on Sharae Faisal near the Tipu Sultan Road on Thursday. 
The traffic police officer at the Firozabad checkpost, Ashraf Jhat, said that the driver lost control of the bus while he was going up the flyover. The bus hit the wall of the Fauzia Wahab Bridge on the road made slippery by rain. 
The bus ended up on either side of the divider but there was no major injury or loss due to it being a public holiday. 
There were very few people on the bus and very few vehicles on the road. 
The bus service was inaugurated last month as a solution to the challenges faced by women commuters.

7,"Gas supply at sehri and iftar, says utility",The company said said that gas pressure would be low from 8am to 2:30pm as it was facing a shortfall,"The Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) said on Wednesday that gas would be supplied to domestic consumers for sehri and iftar  during Ramazan, resulting in a fierce backlash. 
The company said said that gas pressure would be low from 8am to 2:30pm as it was facing a shortfall of 250 million mmBtu.
For iftar, gas will be supplied to consumers in Karachi from 2:30pm to 07:00pm, while for Sehr it will be available from 2:30am to 05:00am. 
The utility said that consumers would face low pressure or complete suspension during the rest of the day.
Consumers say that gas supply is either intermittent or completely cut off, with complaints coming from North Nazimabad, New Karachi, Nagan Chowrangi, Gulshan-e-Iqbal and other areas. 
SSGC says it has not resorted to load-shedding during Ramazan while blaming the low pressure on the excessive usage at the times of sehri and iftar.
