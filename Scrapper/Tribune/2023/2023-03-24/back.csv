0,Wrong decision by SC to cause ‘political instability’,"On delay in Punjab polls, minister says govt wants to proceed according to Constitution","Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah on Thursday said that if the Supreme Court did not make a prudent decision regarding the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) postponing polls in Punjab, the economic and political stability of the country would be impacted.
In a series of tweets, the minister said that an unwise decision from the apex court would cause anarchy, chaos, and riots across the country.
He said that there were different opinions regarding the election and that parliament had the authority to guide the government and institutions. “The incumbent government wants to proceed according to the Constitution.”
The interior minister stated that on the orders of the SC, the electoral watchdog gave the election schedule, and the government had initiated the process under those directives.
Sanaullah maintained that the government could “not even think” of revoking the top court’s orders.
Sanaullah added that there would be no level-playing field in the National Assembly elections in the presence of the incumbent government after the provincial elections, adding that questions would be raised on the conduct of fair and transparent elections.
The interior minister said that it would be better for the country if the elections of all the assemblies were transparent, fair, and conducted at the same time in the presence of the caretaker governments.

1,Asif calls out Imran's 'hypocrisy' for seeking help from US,Says PTI chief first accused the US of conspiring against the party and is now seeking its help,"Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Friday called out Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman and former prime minister Imran Khan for his ""hypocrisy"" in seeking help from the US.
The PML-N leader made the remarks while addressing a foreign media news conference in Islamabad along with Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb.
Asif claimed that the series of events that have taken place after the vote of no-confidence last year “shows the total sum of Imran’s journey — his dismissal from the government and now his SOS to the US for help”.
“His political journey started with a cipher — in which he had accused the US of conspiring against the PTI government,"" said Asif.
“And today, Shireen Mazari has written a letter to the US for him […] the country he once accused of conspiracy … he is now seeking help from them,” he added.
The defence minister claimed that on one hand, Imran had accused former army chief General (retd) Qamar Javed Bajwa of conspiring against him while in office and on the other the then premier had offered Gen Bajwa an extension for life.
He further reiterated that Imran had accused the US of conspiring against him and is now ""flirting with the American government"" for some sort of aid due to the ""victimisation of PTI"" in Pakistan.
""He [Imran] will tell you one thing today and say the opposite tomorrow. His utterances are completely irrational,"" said Asif.
He added that Imran's followers may believe him but most people have lost track of all that the PTI chief has said over the past year.
Commenting on Imran's behaviour, Asif said ""nowhere in the world has an accused ever refused to appear in court"". He added that the deposed PM has been giving excuses related to his security for not appearing in court.
""His [Imran's] appearance in court is accepted while he sits in a car,"" said Asif.
He also accused Imran of attacking courts as they are ""mobbed by his supporters"" when he appears, adding that courts are intimidated and come under pressure as they face threats from PTI supports.
""When the police were sent to his residence to arrest him, they were also attacked,"" said the defence minister. He stated that at least 70-80 police officers, including senior officials, were injured trying to arrest the PTI chief.
Asif said that this has never happened in Pakistan in the past, adding that former leaders have ""surrendered in a dignified manner"" and ""never physically contested their arrest or abused and maligned the courts"".
He noted that when Imran was in power, ""almost all of PML-N’s top leadership was arrested, including Nawaz Sharif who came back from the UK to surrender,"" adding that there was never any resistance from their side.
Sharing a video of the clashes between PTI supporters and the police, Aurangzeb said that when police went to arrest Imran as per court orders, the PTI chief ""defied orders, violated the law, attacked policemen and used women and children as a human shield"".
""Imran Khan is a desperate man,"" said Asif, accusing the PTI chief of demonstrating a type of violence that ""has never happened in Pakistan"".
The defence minister noted that political governments have never resorted to violence against their opponents. ""Such organised violence against state machinery is unprecedented in our history despite the problems we’ve had over the past 75 years,"" he said.
Govt 'willing' to talk to Imran
When asked about the possibility of talks with Imran, the defence minister said that in the past year, the present government has been willing to talk on many occasions.
However, he added, Imran has only been interested in talks with the military but ""never the political leadership"". He said that the PTI chief met with Gen (retd) Bajwa many times when he was the army chief and made attempts to negotiate with him.
The minister said that the government is ""ready to talk for the sake of peace in our country,"" and that there must be a consensus on major issues Pakistan has faced for decades.
""We don’t want a transactional dialogue, we want something comprehensive,"" he added.
Answering a question regarding elections in the country, Asif said that general elections are due in October and will be held on time.
Regarding the Punjab Assembly elections, the PML-N leader said that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has made its decision and according to the constitution, the ECP is the body empowered to hold elections.
'Cult following'
Responding to a question regarding Imran's allegations against Punjab police for conspiring to murder him, Asif said that the PTI chief is making ""scandalous"" claims.
He added that Imran's followers are ""ready to believe anything he says,"" claiming that his following is like ""a cult"" where the ousted premier's supporters follow him blindly, believing everything the PTI chief says.
""Imran has a cult following but it will fizzle out,"" said the defence minister, adding that the alleged conspiracies to murder the ex-PM are ""fabricated lies"".
Asif said that the coalition government is governing the country under exceptionally difficult circumstances, administratively, financially and politically.
""Every day there is a crisis precipitated by Imran Khan and we are handling it,"" said Asif. He expressed hope that the situation will be settled and things will improve.

2,SJC seeks affidavit of complainant of SC judge,Secretary writes letter to Advocate Mian Dawood; affidavit expected to be submitted this week,"The Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) has sought an affidavit from a complainant who moved a complaint of misconduct against a Supreme Court judge on several charges.
SJC Secretary Ishrat Ali, who is also the Supreme Court registrar, has written a letter to complainant Advocate Mian Dawood wherein it is stated: ""Your complaint dated 23.2.2023 is referred. In compliance with requirements of Section 5 (3) of the SJC Procedure of Enquiry Rules 2005, I am directed to require you to file your affidavit in support of the allegations made in the complaint.""
It is learnt that the complainant will submit the affidavit in the current week.
Meanwhile, the SJC also sought a certified copy of the resolution from the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) wherein it was resolved that the complaint would be filed against the SC judge.
All provincial bars had also resolved to move a complaint of misconduct against the SC judge.
However, it was learnt that the bars, wherein Professional Lawyers Group was dominant, were reluctant to file complaints. The same group was also close to the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). On the other hand, the bars, wherein Independent Lawyers Group was in majority, were filing complaints against the SC judge. This group was supporting the incumbent PDM government since April last year.
One member of the SJC, Lahore High Court Chief Justice Qaiser Rashid, was retiring on March 30. The new LHC Chief Justice, Muhammad Ameer Bhatti, will replace him as member of the council.
According to Section 7 of the SJC Inquiry of SJC Procedure of Enquiry Rules 2005, “once any information in respect of enquiry into the conduct of a judge is received by any member or the council, it shall be presented to the chairman of the council, who; shall (a) refer the same to any member of the council to look into the said information; and to express his opinion in relation to sufficiency or otherwise of the information; (b) if the council is satisfied that the information prima facie discloses sufficient material for an enquiry, it shall proceed to consider the same”.
It added, “(2) The member, to whom the chairman has referred the information, will examine the same and ascertain if the information so received discloses specific particulars of misconduct, and provides factual details necessary to form prima facie opinion in respect of the guilt of the judge.
“(3) If the member forms an opinion that the information does reveal sufficient material to commence enquiry, he shall inform the council accordingly and the information shall be placed before the council.
“(4) If the member comes to a conclusion that the information is false, frivolous, concocted or untrue, he shall inform the council accordingly and may recommend action against the person who initiated the information.”
Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial being chairman of the SJC might seek an opinion from Justice Qazi Faez Isa or Justice Sardar Tariq Masood over these complaints against the SC judge. So far four complaints had been filed in the SJC against the SC judge. However, CJP Bandial expressed displeasure over the audio/video leaks related to judges.
The SJC initiated the process regarding verification of the complaint against the SC judge.
Section 5 (3) of SJC Procedure of Enquiry Rules 2005 says that the person providing the said information shall identify himself properly.

3,SCBA slams delay in Punjab elections,"Association says commission acting in blatant disregard of constitutional mandate, SC order ‘unfortunate'","The Supreme Court Bar Association on Thursday condemned the Election Commission of Pakistan's (ECP) move to postpone the elections in Punjab, describing it as “an absolute abrogation of the Constitution.”
A day earlier, the ECP delayed the election in Punjab until October 8 on the grounds that it could not conduct transparent and peaceful polls on the scheduled date of April 30.
In a statement, SCBA President Abid S Zuberi and Secretary Muqtedir Akthar Shabbir maintained that the commission could not change the date for elections “under any circumstances whatsoever”.
They pointed out that the apex court, through its order dated March 1, had made it “inexplicably clear that elections had to be held within the 90-day time period stipulated under Article 224 (2) of the Constitution”.
“However, it is unfortunate that the Election Commission has acted in such blatant disregard of its constitutional mandate and the order of the Supreme Court,” the statement added.
It further read that there was no provision in the Election Act or the Constitution that allowed the ECP to conduct polls beyond the 90-day time period stipulated under Article 224 (2).
“It is truly unfortunate to see that the Election Commission has grossly misinterpreted the Constitution, the law and order of the Supreme Court,” it stated.
The SCBA claimed that the commission had “acted in excess of jurisdiction and breached its constitutional mandate”.
The statement further read that it was also pertinent to highlight that the only constitutional function of the caretaker government was to ensure the conduct of fair and transparent elections.
It added that even the caretaker government was bound by the time period stipulated under Article 224 (2).
“Therefore, the caretaker government cannot function beyond the 90-day period stipulated under Article 224 (2),” it continued.
The SCBA argued that such violation of the Constitution could only lead to utter chaos and anarchy in the country.
“Given the current political and economic crises in the country, restoration of democracy and timely elections are the need of the hour,” the statement read.
The association contended that the ECP, by issuing the notification dated March 22, had now opened the door to “absolute chaos and uncertainty”.

4,Inflation-hit nation braces for toughest Ramazan,Retailers complain of supplies at higher prices whereas wholesalers give reason of shortage of commodities,"Citizens across the country are facing the toughest Ramazan this year as hyperinflation coupled with economic slowdown and reduced incomes is restricting their buying power, putting a bar on their daily expenses, especially the consumption of edible commodities, during the holy month.
With the arrival of the month of blessings where prices of commodities fall drastically elsewhere in the world, the rates of supplies in Pakistan multiply, causing misery for the already poverty-stricken nation.
The retailers complained that they received fruits and vegetables at higher rates whereas wholesalers made an excuse of shortage of supplies.
Meeting kitchen expenses, especially for the mediocre and low-income groups during the holy month, became a challenge due to skyrocketing inflation.
Start with pakoras – a Ramazan delight – without which the menu seems to be incomplete and is a favourite of every household.
The price of chickpea flour (besan) – the main ingredient in pakoras – has soared to an unprecedented level. It is being sold between Rs250-300 per kilo as against Rs150-200 last year. If bought readymade from market, pakoras are available at Rs400 per kilo.
The rates of Iranian dates have soared to Rs600 per kilo.
A major jump has been seen in the price of bananas – the main product of fruit chaat (salad). The fruit, which was sold at Rs200 a dozen just a month ago, is now being retailed at Rs500 per dozen.
Chicken meat – the price of which has already shot up several times during the past few months – is now being traded at Rs750-800 per kilo as compared to its earlier rate of Rs650 per kilo. It is expected to cross the price of beef.

Several households prefer buying loose flour because of affordability issues. Most of them buy the commodity on a daily basis.
The availability of loose flour is already scarce in several areas and is being sold at Rs160 per kilo, making it extremely difficult for the breadwinners to feed their families.
A tandoori naan is being sold at Rs30 in some cities whereas in others at Rs40.
Onions, a basic cooking ingredient, is being traded between Rs120-200 per kilo at the retail market as compared to Rs40-80 during last Ramazan.
The fine quality cooking oil is available at around Rs650 per litre against the price of Rs400 last year.
Loose milk rate has increased to Rs210 per litre as compared to Rs150 last year whereas yogurt is being sold between Rs280-300 per kilo against its price of Rs240 previous year.
High-quality basmati rice is being sold at Rs360 per kilo as compared to Rs250 last year.
Surge in the rates of electricity and gas has also added to the citizens’ misery.

5,Punjab to probe Imran’s ‘murder plot' claim,Caretaker govt forms judicial commission,"The caretaker Punjab government has formed a judicial commission to investigate the allegation of conspiracy to assassinate PTI chairman and former prime minister Imran Khan.
Speaking to the media on Thursday, Caretaker Punjab Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi maintained that the decision of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to postpone the provincial polls was its own.
He added that the commission must have made the decision after much deliberation following consultations with the provincial administration and other departments.
A day earlier, the ECP delayed the election in Punjab until October 8 on the grounds that it could not conduct transparent and peaceful polls on the scheduled date of April 30.
The caretaker chief minister told the media that the provincial government had taken notice of Imran’s statement of a plan to kill him and formed a judicial commission to probe into the matter.
On Wednesday, the PTI chief had once again sounded alarms that he was in the crosshairs as another plan was hatched to take aim at his life “either today or tomorrow” outside Zaman Park – his Lahore residence that remained a hotbed of the ongoing political drama.
The former prime minister claimed the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government was planning to assassinate him at his residence similar to what happened to former premier Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s elder son Murtaza Bhutto through a police operation.
Addressing his supporters through a video link from his Zaman Park residence, Imran named the Punjab and Islamabad police chiefs as well as the “handlers” for conceiving a plan to set the stage for a fake police encounter against him.

Naqvi told the media that if there was any truth in Imran’s claim, the culprits would be taken to task.
The caretaker chief minister noted that Imran was criticising the police but still seeking more security.
He maintained that the PTI chief using abusive language against the police and threatening them was against the norms of decency.
“I don’t have to participate in the elections or indulge in politics. I only have to serve the people for their betterment,” he added.
Naqvi said only the cost of setting up a Ramazan Bazaar this year was coming to Rs5 billion.
He further noted that earlier, even those who owned land cruisers bought flour at subsidised rates, but only the deserving people would receive it free of charge this time.
He added that the deserving people could have themselves registered for free flour through the Benazir Income Support Programme.
He informed reporters that those without a CNIC were being listed in registers and the process of providing them with free flour had already been kicked off.
The caretaker chief minister maintained that in the last few days, five million bags of free flour had been distributed among deserving people across Punjab.
