0,Oil steady on jobs data,Jobs report counters bearish signals from Fed chair,"Oil prices steadied on Thursday, having hit their lowest since late 2021 earlier this week, as strong US jobs data countered bearish signals from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, highlighting banking sector risks and swelling US crude stockpiles.
Brent crude futures were up 1 cent, or 0.01%, at $76.70 a barrel at 1324 GMT, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 4 cents, or 0.1%, to $70.94, making good on some deeper losses earlier in the session.
Powell said on Wednesday that banking industry stress could trigger a credit crunch, with “significant” implications for an economy that US central bank officials projected will slow even more this year than previously thought.
The Bank of England on Thursday followed the Federal Reserve and the Swiss National Bank in hiking interest rates.

1,China Evergrande’s EV unit may halt production,Aims to cut costs by reducing staff numbers and improving management efficiency,"China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd said on Thursday it may have to halt production of electric vehicles (EVs) if it could not obtain fresh funding, after delivering more than 900 units of its flagship Hengchi 5 model.
The EV manufacturing unit of the embattled developer China Evergrande Group said it was aiming to cut costs through measures such as reducing staff numbers and improving management efficiency.
“In the face of inability to obtain additional liquidity, the group is at risk of discontinuing production,” it said.
If, however, it could obtain financing of more than 29 billion yuan ($4.2 billion) “in the future”, it aimed to launch a number of flagship models and hoped to achieve mass production, the company said in a statement.
Under that plan, the cumulative unleveraged cash flow from 2023 to 2026 was expected to reach negative 7 billion yuan to a negative 5 billion yuan.
The news comes after its parent, China Evergrande Group, on Wednesday announced plans for the restructuring of its $22.7 billion in offshore debt, which could set a template for distressed rivals in the property sector.

2,Low horsepower tractors hurt agriculture,PBC report underlines need for using better machinery for sustainable growth,"A widespread issue across Pakistan’s agriculture sector is the locally built low-powered tractors, revealed a report titled State of Pakistan’s Agriculture, which was launched by the Pakistan Business Council (PBC).
Tractor industry had been given protection from imports a few decades ago in order to support the local manufacturers and promote the production of tractors.
“Despite decades of protection and the government’s direct support to farmers for the purchase of these tractors, Pakistan’s most common tractors operate in the range of 50 horsepower,” stated the report.
The low horsepower tractors can typically plough soil to a maximum of about 18 inches.
“This means that on most farms in Pakistan, soil compaction is usually found at a depth of 15 to 18 inches. This is called ‘hard pan’ which must be broken for the cotton plant to grow sustainably,” explained the report.
The cotton plant sets its roots far deeper reaching over four feet and is best watered through its roots by using the water retained by the soil it grows in.
Hard pan means that the roots of a typical cotton plant are found to turn at right angle at the depth of around 18 inches, sometimes even less.
“Natural need of the cotton plant is not being met because of the inadequate farm machinery being used through seasons. This means that, instead of watering the cotton plant through the soil, excessive surface watering is commonly practiced in Pakistan,” stated the report.
The inappropriate watering provides a home to insects and leads to a higher use of insecticides, resulting in lack of compliance with the global sustainability standards.
“If the correct farm machinery is used, less surface water will mean less insects, less insecticide sprays, and greater sustainability,” the report added.

3,Adani to expand aviation business,Plans to bid for more govt-run airports,"India’s Adani Group will focus on expanding its aviation business and plans to bid for more government-run airports when they come up for privatisation, Adani Airports’ chief executive said on Wednesday.
India is the world’s fastest-growing aviation market, with demand for air travel outstripping the supply of planes. Some major airports are already reaching full capacity even as airlines continue to order more planes.
“Our ambition is to do more airports in India,” said Arun Bansal, CEO of Adani Airports, adding that the government’s airport privatisation policy is publicly known, “and we intend to bid for that”.
Adani already owns and operates seven airports, including six that it won as part of the government’s first privatisation drive, and a new airport it is building in Navi Mumbai on the outskirts of India’s financial capital.
The government has plans to privatise 25 more airports under public-private partnership until 2025 and Bansal said the group would look at bidding “if the conditions are right”. The expansion plans come as billionaire Gautam Adani’s group tries to rebuild investor confidence after US short-seller Hindenburg Research accused it of stock manipulation and improper use of tax havens – charges the company has denied.
Hindenburg’s January 24 report eroded more than $100 billion in the value of the company’s shares.
Asked if the group’s challenges would affect airport expansion or investment plans, Bansal brushed aside concerns, saying it is pushing ahead and all its projects are on track. “Our strategy is simple - to create scale,” he said.

4,Toshiba accepts $15.2b buyout proposal,Deal will see scandal-ridden company taken in domestic hands,"Toshiba Corp’s board accepted a $15.2 billion buyout offer from a group led by private equity firm Japan Industrial Partners, the company said on Thursday, potentially drawing a line under years of upheaval at the conglomerate.
A successful deal, which would value Toshiba at 4,620 yen per share or 2 trillion yen in total, would see the scandal-ridden company taken private and firmly in domestic hands after much tension with overseas activist shareholders. It is, however, not yet clear whether activist funds will be satisfied with the terms. The offer price would give just a 9.7% premium over Thursday’s closing price of 4,213 yen.
Toshiba said in a filing that the board would not go as far as recommending shareholders to tender their shares, because the offer price is not high enough to give recommendations.
The price was lowered a few times from an initial offer of up to 5,500 yen per share, according to the filing.
It also said the board’s support may change before late July, when the JIP group plans to start the tender offer.
But the JIP bid is “the only complete proposal” that has been submitted during a one-year competitive auction process, and would give shareholders a chance to exit their investments, Toshiba said.
“This ends months of uncertainty regarding whether a deal was coming and years of uncertainty regarding board understanding of the right price,” said analyst Travis Lundy of Quiddity Advisers.

5,Luban Workshop empowering Pakistani youth,"Under this initiative, youth get technical knowhow, job opportunities","Luban Workshop, an initiative jointly advanced by the Punjab Technical Education and Vocational Training Authority (TEVTA), Pakistan and Tianjin Modern Vocational Technology College, China, is empowering the local youth by equipping them with technical knowhow.
“So far, 33 Pakistani graduates have received both Pakistani vocational training certificates and Chinese academic certificates,” Zhang Ying, Director of International Department, Tianjin Modern Vocational Technology College, told the China Economic Net (CEN).
Under this initiative, students first take a six-month course of Luban Workshop, then a 24-month study on electrical automation at Tianjin Modern Vocational Technology College, and six-month internship in enterprises in alliance with the workshop.
“Eight enterprises in Pakistan have entered into industry-education alliance with Luban Workshop, providing employment opportunities to the students,” Zhang added.
Unveiled at the Punjab TEVTA in 2018, the workshop primarily serves the industrial modernisation of Lahore and Multan to help in Pakistan’s industrial transformation and agricultural mechanisation.
To cultivate technical talents with necessary capabilities, 32 teachers from Pakistan and China have developed six textbooks, one set of simulation software, 160 pieces of courseware, and nearly 1,500 minutes of teaching videos.
The star course, Industrial Automation and Robotics which has been included in the technical education and vocational training system of Punjab, has completed 4,000 class hours of teaching in the local area, trained 13,572 technical youth in neighbouring provinces, and seen all the students find employment.
“In collaboration with MNS University of Agriculture, Multan, we carry out an agricultural machinery training programme. Following a two-month training last October and November, a Chinese company donated a self-propelled corn harvester to MNSUAM and more modern machinery are yet to be introduced to Pakistan,” Zhang told CEN.
Annually, an average of 512 local teachers, students, and users with bachelor’s degree or above receive agricultural training, promoting mechanisation and technological innovation in Pakistan’s agriculture sector.
In Pakistan, about three million young people enter the job market each year. But lack of access to technical training and the outdated training agenda are hindering them from landing a job and obstructing the agricultural and industrial modernisation.
Luban Workshop is an international vocational education project initiated by China. Up to now, colleges in Tianjin have set up dozens of such workshops in 19 countries in Asia, Africa, and Europe, empowering local youth to learn state-of-the-art technologies and contribute to their country’s development.

6,Pakistan’s cotton yield 50% lower than region,Shrinking crop planting area sparks concern among policymakers,"Pakistan is facing a sharp decline in cotton production as its per-acre yield has contracted to just half of the cotton productivity in regional countries.
Owing to thin profit margins for cotton planting, farmers have switched over to other crops like rice, maize and sugarcane. Economic policymakers have expressed serious concern over the constant decline in cotton production over the years.
In a recent meeting of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC), the policymakers and Finance Minister Ishaq Dar observed that the cotton sowing area was shrinking, which was a cause of concern for the government. Dar, who chairs the ECC meetings, pointed out that the per-acre cotton production in regional countries was double the per-acre harvest in Pakistan.
It was emphasised that the Ministry of National Food Security and Research would look into developing a support price mechanism in consultation with the Ministry of Industries and Production.
The ECC noted that for the cotton support price, the wheat and sugarcane model might be considered.
Commerce Division secretary underlined the need for adopting international principles as well as undertaking a study on the comparative advantages of crops.
The Ministry of National Food Security recalled that the production of cotton, being the key crop in Pakistan’s agricultural economy, reached the high of 14.1 million bales in the 2004-05 season. However, in later years, its harvest averaged around 12 million bales while in the last four years, the output dropped to 7 million bales in 2020-21 and about 9.45 million bales in 2021-22.
Moreover, the unprecedented floods in 2022 significantly damaged the standing cotton crop, slashing overall production to a mere 4.76 million bales (according to cotton arrivals till March 3, 2023) against the target of 9 million bales.
The ministry stated that cotton production was decreasing and at the same time planting area was also shrinking. To meet the demand of textile industry, Pakistan has the potential to ramp up cotton production to 15 million bales in a short time span.
It was stated that the cotton price intervention policy during 2021-22 had resulted in price stability in the domestic market and higher investment in crop management, increasing production by 2 million bales despite a 7% decline in the cultivated area.
Similarly, the policy adopted in 2022-23 also ensured price stability in the domestic market. However, the unprecedented floods significantly damaged the standing crop.
The Ministry of National Food Security informed the ECC that in order to draw up a cotton intervention price proposal, consultations were held with all stakeholders including the provincial governments, growers and cotton associations in January and February 2023.
Growers proposed an intervention price of Rs7,000-8,000 per 40 kg.
Since the last consultation on February 10, 2023, the cost of inputs had further increased. The revised average cost of production “is now approximately Rs7,000 per 40 kg”, the food ministry said.
Stakeholders, including the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association, called for pegging the cotton intervention price with the import parity price in line with the policy adopted over the past two years. In a meeting convened at the Prime Minister’s Office on March 13, 2023, the ministry said that it was decided to submit a summary, proposing cotton intervention price of Rs8,500 per 40 kg, for ECC’s consideration.
It was emphasised that the announcement of intervention price ahead of the main sowing season would help growers decide on the planting area and investment in crop management. The proposed price was expected to help enhance yield and sowing area by 10-15%. The Ministry of National Food Security submitted following proposals for the ECC’s consideration and approval.
Fix cotton (phutti) intervention price at Rs8,500 per 40 kg.
Constitute a cotton price review committee with the mandate to review market prices and propose intervention on a fortnightly basis.
Provinces or the Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) should procure cotton lint (base grade-III with staple length of 1-1/32”) from the pre-selected ginning factories.
ECC should advise TCP or provinces when to sell the procured cotton after assessing the local and international markets. Regularly monitor cotton prices in the main markets of Punjab and Sindh as well as in the international market and issue a brief price report at weekly intervals.
When domestic prices of cotton (phutti) drop below the threshold of Rs8,500 per 40 kg, trigger the intervention price at a 10% discount to the estimated import parity price.
The ECC considered the summary titled “Cotton Intervention Price for 2023-24 Crop”, submitted by the Ministry of National Food Security, and decided to set cotton (phutti) intervention price at Rs8,500 per 40 kg for the current crop.
It also constituted a cotton price review committee with the mandate to review market prices and propose intervention on a fortnightly basis.
The committee will regularly monitor cotton prices in the main markets of Punjab and Sindh as well as in the international market and issue a brief report at weekly intervals.
The ECC directed the Ministry of National Food Security to present a report on the deliberations held by the price review committee at the end of each month.

7,Bitcoin mining booms in Texas,"Bankruptcies, worries over power consumption fail to dent industry’s growth","Cryptocurrency bankruptcies and worries over electric power consumption have failed to dent the industry's growth in Texas, according to a top trade group, citing the rise in the miners’ power demands.
Bitcoin miners consume about 2,100 megawatts of the state’s power supplies, said Lee Bratcher, President of industry group Texas Blockchain Council.
That power usage rose 75% last year and was nearly triple that of the prior 12 months, Bratcher said.
Those demands amount to about 3.7% of the state’s lowest forecast peak load this year, according to data from grid operator Electric Reliability Council of Texas (Ercot).
“There’s been some challenges with the Bitcoin mining industry,” Bratcher said, noting his group recently saw two prominent bankruptcies and other miners scaling back expansions.
The industry also faces new federal regulations, including a proposed 30% tax on electricity usage for digital mining and calls by the US Treasury secretary and commodities regulator for a regulatory framework.
New York this year imposed a ban on some cryptocurrency mining that runs on fossil fuel-generated power. Other states are expected to follow suit.
But in Texas, some counties have offered tax incentives and miners continue to be drawn to its wind and solar power, which could supply about 39% of Ercot’s energy needs in 2023.
“Bitcoin mining is a very energy-intensive business, which is why we tend to find places like West Texas to be full of Bitcoin miners,” said Matt Prusak, Chief Commercial Officer at cryptocurrency miner US Bitcoin Corp, which has one of its mining operations in a 280-megawatt wind farm in Texas.
Its McCamey, Texas, site last month consumed 173,000 megawatt hours of power, about 60% provided by the grid and nearly 40% from the nearby wind farm.
The average American home uses about 10 MWh in a year, according to the Energy Information Administration.
In Texas, where about 250 people died during a winter storm blackout that exposed the fragility of the state’s grid, the prospect of higher crypto demand has raised alarms.
“There are a lot of Bitcoin mines that are trying to connect to the system,” said Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin.
“If all of them were to connect in the timelines that they are looking to connect, then it probably would present an issue to the grid because that load would be growing way faster than it ever has before.”

8,Banks jack up lending rate for govt to record high,Govt raised Rs1.14tr through sale of T-bills to meet its expenditures,"The cost of running the crisis-hit economy has spiked as commercial banks have jacked up the price of lending to the cash-strapped government by one percentage point to a new all-time high at 22%.
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reported that the government raised domestic debt worth Rs1.14 trillion through the sale of mostly three-month treasury bills (T-bills) to banks. It also raised some financing through the six-month and 12-month papers.
Financial institutions increased the cost of lending (cut-off yields on T-bills) to a new high on expectations the central bank would further hike its benchmark policy rate by one percentage point to 21% in the forthcoming monetary policy meeting on April 4, 2023.
The commercial banks’ financing rate had been around 15.71% for three-month bills in November 2022, suggested the available data.
The government had targeted to borrow Rs900 billion through the auction of sovereign debt securities to commercial banks. It would utilise the borrowed funds to return the maturing debt of Rs255 billion to the banks and use the remaining amount to meet growing expenditures including interest payment on the outstanding debt.
Interest payment has become the largest expenditure for the government and it is expected to eat up almost 50% of the total revenue collection this year. Each time the central bank increases its key policy rate, the size of interest payment by the government also rises.
Global ratings agency Moody’s Investors Service said in late February “Pakistan has very weak debt affordability (foreign debt in particular). Moody’s estimates that interest payments will increase to around 50% of the government revenue in fiscal 2023.”
Various experts estimate that a one-percentage-point increase in policy rate will push up interest payment in the range of Rs100-200 billion per year.
Market reports suggest the central bank is set to increase the benchmark lending rate by one percentage point on the recommendation of International Monetary Fund (IMF) for reviving its $6.5 billion loan programme.
The resumption of the programme will also unlock billions of dollars of financing by other multilateral and bilateral creditors.
Earlier, the donors had pledged over $9 billion in flood-relief for Pakistan.
Media reports suggest the central bank had increased its policy rate by an aggressive three percentage points to an all-time high at 20% on the IMF’s recommendation.
The central bank, however, dismissed the notion, saying that it jacked up the rate to control the soaring inflation.
Experts are of the view that a further policy rate hike will prove ineffective as the supply-side inflation (like increase in energy prices) is beyond the central bank’s control.
The government’s reliance on domestic debt has soared significantly in recent times in the absence of foreign debt.
According to the central bank data, the government has borrowed almost Rs19 trillion (83% of total deposits) from commercial banks over a period of time to finance its fiscal deficit.
The government’s other big expenditures include paying monthly pensions and salaries to state employees, defence spending, feeding the loss-making state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and social spending under the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP).

In addition to these, the rehabilitation and reconstruction of flood-hit areas has emerged as a big expenditure in the wake of 2022 floods that pushed one-third of the country under water and displaced 33 million people.
In recent weeks, the government has drawn up a plan to get direct financing from banks without holding competitive bidding to swiftly meet its ever-growing expenditures. The IMF, however, has barred the government from direct borrowing and called for raising debt in the traditional way of auctioning the papers.
T-bill auction results
The government on Thursday raised Rs949.46 billion through the sale of three-month T-bills at a cut-off yield of 21.99% compared to 20.99% in the previous auction held on March 8, 2023.
It borrowed another Rs15.50 billion against six-month T-bills at a cut-off yield of 21.99% compared to 20.84%, an increase of 114 basis points.
The government also acquired Rs151 billion against 12-month papers at a cut-off yield of 21.48% compared to 20.98% earlier, a rise of 50 basis points. It raised another Rs24.91 billion from banks through non-competitive bidding, the data suggested.
