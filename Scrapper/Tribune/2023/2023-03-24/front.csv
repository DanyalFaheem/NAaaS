1,K-P governor proposes election on Oct 8,"In letter to ECP, Ghulam Ali cites security situation as reason for delaying K-P polls earlier scheduled for May 28","Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) Governor Haji Ghulam Ali on Friday proposed elections of the provincial assembly on Oct 8, the same date the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) had set for the voting in Punjab.
Governor Ali wrote a letter to Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja, fixing the election date for the K-P Assembly election.
The governor also mentioned a deteriorating law and order situation in the province.
“Since the ECP has postponed the election date for the general elections of Punjab province to Oct 8, 2023, therefore, it is also suggested that same Oct 8, 2023 be proposed/appointed as election date for General Elections of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa in the best public interest as well as in the interest of the state,” the letter stated.
The announcement of the date came after a series of consultations held between the governor and the ECP on the order of the Supreme Court in its judgment in the suo motu case about the election date earlier this month.
The general elections of the Punjab and K-P assemblies were due after the two houses were dissolved by their respective chief ministers in January. However, in the absence of the announcement of the election date, the apex court took the suo motu notice.
The Supreme Court then ordered the president to appoint the date for election of the Punjab Assembly and the K-P governor for his province in consultation with the ECP. Subsequently, the president gave the date of April 30.
On Wednesday, however, the ECP postponed the election in Punjab until Oct 8, citing lack of funds and other security issues related to holding peaceful and transparent election.
In the letter to CEC Raja, the K-P governor also pointed out that the province was in the grip of a “fresh wave of terrorist activities” on a daily basis.
“Major terrorist activities include cross-border fire in North Waziristan, IED (improvised explosive device) blast on army vehicle in Kohat, [and] heavy exchange of fire with terrorists in South Waziristan on March 15,” he said.
“Unidentified terrorists [opened] fire at Bara police station in Khyber district on March 19 and terrorists attacked a police station in DI Khan[, which was] followed by a search operation by the army resulting in [the] martyrdom of three soldiers on [the] night of March 21-22, 2023,” he added.
“On March 21, 2023, a convoy was ambushed in South Waziristan, resulting in [the] martyrdom of Brigadier Mustafa Kamal Burki from ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence) and injuring seven other ranks wherein two are critically injured.”
On the governor’s decision, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Senator Waleed Iqbal said that the date of Oct 8 was a deviation from the Constitution, which stipulated elections within 90 days of the dissolution of the assembly.
“According to the Constitution, elections must be held within 90 days of the dissolution of the assembly,” the PTI senator told The Express Tribune. “Currently, the country is under a civilian martial law.”
On the other hand, Prime Minister’s Adviser Qamar Zaman Kaira said that though the Constitution mandated the election within 90 days of the dissolution of the assembly, ground realities must be taken into consideration.
“We must see what the ground realities are,” Kaira, who is also a senior leader of the Pakistan Peoples Party, said. “The process of census is also ongoing in the country. In such a situation, the holding of elections can be controversial.”

2,Govt in breach of Constitution: Alvi,"President asks PM to hold Punjab, K-P polls on time","President Dr Arif Alvi on Friday wrote a letter to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif emphasising that he should direct all the executive authorities concerned with federal and provincial governments to assist the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in holding the elections in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa within the constitutional timeframe.
Through the letter, the president conveyed to the premier that holding elections in the two provinces was necessary to comply with an order of the Supreme Court issued on March 1, saying the order should be abided by to avoid further complications, including contempt of court proceedings.
Without mincing any words, Dr Alvi underlined that in his opinion “flagrant violation of the Constitution had been committed by the executive authorities and government departments”.
He added that the ECP had not implemented the announcement of holding elections in Punjab on April 30, 2023, and also “blatantly violated the Supreme Court’s order dated March 1, 2023”.
Also, President Alvi alleged, “It appeared that federal and caretaker governments in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa advised the heads of departments concerned to indicate their inability to provide the necessary support for holding general elections.”
He referred to Article 220 of the Constitution which stated: “It shall be the duty of all executive authorities in the federation and in the provinces to assist the commissioner and the Election Commission in the discharge of his or their functions.”
The president’s letter came after the ECP on March 22 announced delay in the election in Punjab until Oct 8 on the grounds that it could not conduct transparent and peaceful polls on the scheduled date of April 30.
In an eight-page order, the ECP said that it could not hold the election “honestly, justly, and fairly in a peaceful manner due to security threats [and] in the absence of funds” and being unable to provide “level-playing field” to all political parties.
The ECP said that the elections could not be held in Punjab under the circumstances conveyed to it by the law enforcement agencies, finance, defence and interior ministries, Punjab chief secretary and others, who all opposed the polls on various grounds.
Meanwhile, President Alvi accused PM Shehbaz of holding “no meaningful consultation with the President on policy issues”, saying it was the responsibility of the prime minister to furnish information relating to the administration of affairs of the federation and proposals for legislation.
In the letter, President Alvi stated, “It was a matter of concern that no meaningful consultation with the President on policy issues had been undertaken by the Prime Minister in line with Article 46 of the Constitution.”
Alvi reminded Shehbaz that the article says that the prime minister shall keep the president informed on all matters of internal and foreign policy and on all legislative proposals the federal government intends to bring before parliament.
He added that Rule 15(5) of Rules of Business, 1973, also highlighted the responsibility of the prime minister, inter-alia, to furnish such information relating to the administration of affairs of the federation and proposals for legislation as the president may call for.
The president stated in the letter that elections of provincial assemblies, in case of their dissolution under Article 105 or Article 112, were required to be held within 90 days under Article 224 (2) of the Constitution.
He added that the Supreme Court had directed the ECP to propose date(s) to the president for holding the poll within 90 days or on a date that deviated to the barest minimum from the aforesaid deadline.
He said that the K-P governor was also directed by the Supreme Court to appoint a date for holding the general election for the provincial assembly of K-P as per above timeframe.
Subsequently, the ECP had proposed holding of general elections between April 30 and May 7, 2023, and general elections for the Punjab Assembly on April 30, 2023, and the same was notified by the ECP.
Human right violations
Additionally, the president drew the PM’s attention towards the human rights violation, saying events had taken place in the recent past that were highlighted by the print, electronic, and social media about glaring violations of fundamental and human rights that needed to be brought to the PM’s notice to ensure remedial measures and preventive action.
In his letter, the president also drew the attention of the premier towards “the seriousness of incidents of human rights violations, atrocities of police and law enforcement agencies, and grossly disproportionate use of force against the citizens of Pakistan”.
He said that multiple fake and frivolous cases had been registered against politicians, workers, journalists and media persons; houses of political workers had been raided, and citizens had been abducted without warrants and lawful justification.
The president termed the incidents of human rights violations and oppression by state machinery against innocent citizens as “clear breach and violations of fundamental rights” guaranteed by Article 4 of the Constitution, which provided for, and guaranteed citizens to enjoy the protection of law and to be treated in accordance with the law.
He also referred to Article 9 on ‘security of person’, Article 10 on ‘safeguards as to arrest and detention’, Article 10-A on ‘right to fair trial’, Article 14 on ‘inviolability of dignity of man etc’, Article 15 on ‘freedom of movement etc’, Article 16 on ‘freedom of assembly’, Article 17 on ‘freedom of association’ and Article 19 on ‘freedom of speech’, saying that the spirit and mandate of these articles were being clearly transgressed.
“This has tarnished the image of Pakistan in the international community and is casting negative repercussions on the future of democracy and state of human rights in Pakistan,” he said, highlighting that Pakistan’s ranking dropped 12 points downwards in the World Press Freedom Index, 2022.
Pakistan ranked 145 out of 180 countries, he said, which reflected the sorry state of affairs and this year’s actions and images would further exacerbate Pakistan’s already dismal ranking.
ECP apprises president
The Election Commission wrote a letter to President Alvi, in which he has taken into confidence over the postponement of the Punjab Assembly elections.
According to sources, the ECP informed the president about the reasons for postponing the elections in Punjab. In this regard, the president was taken into confidence through a letter.

3,Attorney general steps down,"Appointed on the recommendation of a section of superior judiciary, sources revealed Elahi was asked to resign","The country's top law officer, Barrister Shehzad Ata Elahi, on Friday resigned from his position of attorney general for Pakistan (AGP).
Sources revealed to The Express Tribune that Elahi was asked to resign. However, there was no official confirmation regarding his resignation.
It was learnt that the federal government had appointed him as the AGP on the recommendation of one section of the superior judiciary.
Now, the government had given a message to the section of judges who had halted the appointment of Mansoor Usman Awan as the AGP. Earlier, the government had no choice but to appoint their recommended lawyer on the same post.
Elahi, who enjoyed a good reputation in the legal fraternity became a victim of the ongoing clash between the judiciary and the executive.
Regarding the new appointment, the sources revealed to The Express Tribune that the government was considering various options and the appointment would be made in view of the composition of benches in high-profile cases.
Now, the government was again considering the name of Awan for the same slot. However, one section within the government believed that if the composition of benches would not be fair, Irfan Qadir would be the best option to raise objections on the benches.
Elahi had a good reputation for his hard work, integrity, and understanding of legal issues. He was also a young corporate lawyer with experience in commercial, tax and banking laws, civil, commercial, corporate, constitutional litigation etc.
Elahi belonged to the famous law firm, Cornelius, Lane and Mufti.
Interestingly, Supreme Court’s Justice Ijazul Ahsan also worked with the said firm before his elevation to the bench.
Hamid Khan and Salman Aslam Butt were senior members of that firm and former chief justice Jawad S Khawaja had also worked with it.
