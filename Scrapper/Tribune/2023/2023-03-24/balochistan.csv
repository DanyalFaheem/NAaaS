0,Overpricing in Ramzan bazaars irks citizens,Sources claim authorities concerned failed to enforce official rates,"Inflation-hit citizens visiting Sasta Ramazan bazaars set up in various areas of the garrison city to buy daily-use items at cheaper rates have complained about the exorbitant rates amid unprecedented inflation.
Although the district administration has established several Sasta Ramzan bazaars and Fair Price shops in the city and Cantt areas to ensure the supply of essential items including vegetables, gram flour, dates, fruit, and chicken at affordable prices during the fasting month, people said the relief was insignificant given the scale of current inflation.
Citizens said this Ramazan is like no other as they are finding it increasingly hard to put food on the table for iftar and sehri.
They dubbed the discount offered to them at these bazaars a joke and said a meager Rs30 to Rs40 difference in comparison with the open market is a farce, to say the least.
People visiting the market to buy fruit for Iftar on the first day of the holy month returned empty-handed as apples were available at Rs450 per kg, guavas at Rs300 per kg, melon at Rs200 per kg, bananas at Rs300 per dozen and dates at Rs500 to Rs700 per kg.
A citizen said that the administration failed to curb the hike in food prices a week before Ramazan and the new prices of essential commodities were implemented to rob the people.
Citizens Mohammad Ramzan, Bashir Ahmed, Gulshan Malik, and Yasir Shabbir said that the rates of various items are reduced for those observing the holy month all over the world but in our country, Ramazan is considered an occasion to gain maximum profit, they said.
They further said the inflation is so high that they can’t even buy the basic food items for Iftar.
The citizens said that the authorities concerned have failed to enforce official prices, due to which those who earn profit by creating artificial inflation keep fleecing the people.
Before the advent of the fasting month, the Rawalpindi district administration had fixed new prices of essential commodities besides making 16 Ramazan Sasta Bazaars, 34 Fair Price Shops, and 8 Sasta Saheri Bazaars functional to help mitigate the impacts of high inflation on the low-income strata.
Sources in the administration said that 10 Ramazan Sasta Bazaars have been set up in the Cantonment areas and one each in Murree, Kotli Sattian, Kallar Syedan, Kahutta, Gujar Khan, and Taxila.

1,PTI flayed for engaging US PR firm,Sherry takes jab at Imran's 'double standards and U-turns',"Federal Minister for Climate Change Senator Sherry Rehman on Thursday slammed Imran for another 'U-turn' made by his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) by signing a six-month agreement with a private US consulting firm, Praia Consultant, for using their services to promote the party's image and restore its lost credibility.
تحریک انصاف نے امریکہ میں اپنی کھوئی ہوئی ساکھ کو بحال کرنے کیلئے ایک اور لابنگ فرم کے ساتھ معاہدہ کیا ہے۔ پرائے کنسلٹنٹ کے ساتھ معاہدے کا مقصد تحریک انصاف کے امریکہ کے ساتھ تعلقات بہتر کرنا ہے۔ ""سازشی سائفر"" میں ناکامی کے بعد اب زور و شور سے ڈالرز میں اثر و رسوخ خریدہ جا رہا۔1/3 pic.twitter.com/jO8YxI0rXM
یہ فرم تحریک انصاف کے رہنماؤں کی امریکہ کے ""ڈسیشن میکرز"" کے ساتھ ملاقاتوں کا اہتمام کرے گی اور ان ملاقاتوں کے مواد کے حوالے سے بھی تحریک انصاف کو رہنمائی فراہم کرے گی۔ پاکستان کے امریکہ کے ساتھ تعلقات دائو پر لگا کر یہ اپنی تشہیر کیلئے مسلسل لابنگ کمپنیز کی خدمات لے رہے؟ 2/3
انہوں نے من گھڑت بیرونی سازش کا بیانیہ بنایا۔تاہم آڈیو لیکس میں ثابت ہوا یہ اپنی ذاتی سیاست کیلئے پاکستان کے مفادات کے ساتھ "" کھیلنے"" کا منصوبہ بنا رہے تھے۔ ان کا دوہرا معیار اور یو ٹرن کئی بار بے نقاب ہو چکے ہے۔ عمران خان کو ان معاہدوں کے حوالے سے قوم کو وضاحت پیش کرنی ہوگی۔3/3
In a flurry of tweets, the minister said the signing of the agreement exposed the PTI's ""double standards and hypocrisy"". The federal minister said that many countries appoint lobbyists, and so do political parties, but this case was particularly bizarre because it involved a party that attempted to pose itself as a [political] martyr of the ""US meddling"".

3,Imran’s focal person sent on judicial remand,Judicial magistrate says police fail to recover anything from suspect,"A district and sessions court in Islamabad on Thursday sent Hassan Niazi, the focal person and nephew of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan, to jail on a 14-day judicial remand in a case related to clashes between PTI workers and Islamabad police outside the Federal Judicial Complex during the court appearance of the former prime minister in the Toshakhana case.
The local court rejected the police’s plea seeking further physical remand of Hassan Niazi as the police failed to recover anything from the suspect during the investigation after taking him into custody.
Hassan Niazi was arrested on Monday in a separate case as he was leaving the Federal Judicial Complex after obtaining pre-arrest bail in three cases.
Hassan Niazi was produced in the court of Duty Magistrate Mureed Abbas in District and Sessions Court Islamabad after the expiry of his two-day physical remand.
PTI’s legal team also appeared in court after raising slogans on the court premises.
The investigating officer pleaded to the court to grant a further five-day physical remand of Hassan Niazi. The investigating officer said that the co-accused has been identified while Hasan Niazi’s arms and vehicle were to be recovered.
The PTI lawyers said that more than 72 hours have passed since his arrest but the police could not recover the (said) weapon.
The PTI counsel raised the question that if the arms and vehicle were not in possession of the police, then why have they detained Hassan Niazi?
Lawyer Faisal Chaudhry said that the police failed to trace the vehicle and its owner in the last 72 hours. He said that Hassan Niazi is a professional lawyer and he obtained three bails on the day of his arrest.
He said that cases were being registered against PTI leaders on political grounds. He said that a lawyer was detained for three days and given a message that he would be arrested and tortured. He said that Islamabad police were humiliating a professional lawyer.
PTI’s lawyer Ali Bukhari pleaded to discharge Hassan Niazi from the case, saying that his arrest was illegal.
Lawyer Qaiser Imam said that according to the police, the co-accused ran away while waving the weapon. He asked what kind of friendship is this.? “Being the president of the Islamabad Bar Association, I am very ashamed,” he added.
After hearing the arguments of the parties, Duty Magistrate Mureed Abbas reserved the verdict on the plea for the extension in the physical remand of Hassan Niazi.
Later, the court announced the reserved verdict, rejecting the police plea for further physical remand of Hassan Niazi. The court issued an order to send him to jail on a 14-day judicial remand.
The duty magistrate wrote in a two-page verdict that “according to the registered case, Hassan Niazi interfered in government affairs. According to the case, Hassan Niazi threatened the police and broke the barriers and the co-accused ran away from the crime scene.

6,QAU to start on-campus classes,"University campus, hostels still off-limits for students of BS programmes","While academic activities continue to remain suspended at the Quaid-e-Azam University (QAU) after two student groups clashed on the campus last month, the top-ranking higher education institution has announced it will start on-campus classes for MPhil and PhD programmes from Monday (March 27).
According to a notification issued by the QAU registrar, MPhil and PhD students should report to their respective departments immediately.
On the other hand, classes of BS programmes have been made online during Ramazan.
The QAU administration has asked BS students to get themselves registered for online classes during Ramazan.
The hostel allotment to the students could not be finalised yet, which continues to take a toll on the students including females who had been evicted from hostels.
According to a notification issued earlier by the QAU registrar, the rules of hostel allotments have been amended in the new policy. According to the new policy, all previous hostel allotments had been cancelled and students will have to apply for hostel rooms under the new policy.
Sources said that the university administration was facing many difficulties in starting on-campus classes and opening hostels, which are being renovated and repaired.
The sources claimed that the on-campus classes for BS programmes will be started after Eidul Fitr as the administration thinks a large number of students for BS programmes will have to come to the campus to use labs and other facilities.
The sources said that the hostels’ administrations will decide on seats keeping in mind the number of students in each department. The chairperson or director of the department will recommend the names of the students for these seats and will be bound to follow the merit list strictly. After the first merit list, a fresh merit list will be prepared after every two semesters.
The allotment for MPhil students will be made for four semesters and the allotment for PhD students will be made for the first four years and there will be no extension of allotment. First-semester students of BS programmes will be given priority in hostel allotments.
Under the new hostel policy, the merit list of the previous semester will be taken into consideration in the current situation or later when a seat becomes vacant in the hostel. It will be mandatory for the students to show their hostel cards while entering the hostels. 
The chairperson or director of any department will be responsible for the supervision of the students during their stay in the hostels. In case of violation of the rules, the allotment will be canceled immediately. The notification further states that no guest of the students will be allowed to stay in the hostels.
Similarly, no attachment of students will be allowed. Hostel timings will be strictly followed for undergraduate students; however, some flexibility will be extended to MPhil and PhD students. Gates of all hostels will be closed at 10 pm. According to the notification, the hostels’ administrations will also ensure that mess bills are paid every month and no exemption will be given without the permission of the administrations. A penalty will be imposed in case of non-payment of the mess bill for two months and allotment can also be cancelled.
There will be no hostel facility for the students studying in centres. If the centres provide funds to the university, their students can be accommodated in the future.
The committee members have also suggested that merit should be ensured for admissions to MPhil and PhD programmes as merit was ignored in the past while giving admissions to doctoral programmes.
The sources said that the committee has recommended strict legal action against those involved in creating law and order and harming peace on the campus.
A proposal has also been made that the university administration with the support of the Islamabad Capital Territory Administration and Islamabad police should form a committee to hold a monthly meeting to evaluate the already taken measures to maintain the law and order and further make it more sustainable.
Earlier, the QAU administration, with the help of police, dislodged hundreds of students including females from various hostels and closed down the campus for two weeks. The move came after two student groups clashed on the campus, which left several students injured.
The QAU administration also cancelled the allotment of rooms and formed a 21-member committee to review the criteria for the reallocation of rooms to the students.
On February 27, the university administration suspended and expelled 79 students for vandalism on the campus and their degrees had also been cancelled.
The sources said that the revised policy will also be applicable to girls' hostels in the autumn session for the year 2023.
Meanwhile, the QAU students have demanded that Vice-Chancellor Dr Niaz Ahmed Akhtar conduct an audit of the appointments made in the university in the last four years. 
They also said that the Higher Education Commission should thrash out a mechanism for monitoring the financial affairs of universities across the country, including the QAU.

7,Low gas pressure adds to people’s woes,Gas company ignores orders for uninterrupted supply during Ramazan,"The unannounced load-shedding and low pressure of the gas at the beginning of the holy month of Ramazan has added to the problems of the citizens of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, who are already suffering from unprecedented inflation.
On the first day of fasting, citizens faced severe difficulties in cooking food due to low gas pressure. On contacting the gas utility company’s helpline, the citizens were told that gas will be supplied from 2:30 am to 6:00 am and from 4:00 pm to 9:00 pm. But the gas pressure remained very low even during the Sehri timing.
The government had issued orders to ensure the uninterrupted supply of gas to domestic consumers during Ramazan, but complaints of low gas pressure were reported in several areas of the twin cities on the first day of the holy month.
These areas include private housing societies around Block-C, Block-D, Satellite Town, Sadiqabad, Imam Bara, Chaklala Scheme-1 and 3, Range Road and GT Road.
Qaiser Nadeem, a citizen, told The Express Tribune that when he called the gas company’s helpline to complain about the absence of gas supply and low pressure in the area, he was told that the gas supply timings were from 2:30 am to 6:00 am and 4:00 pm to 9:00 pm.
He said the government had announced that the uninterrupted supply of gas would continue during Ramazan. “Now the situation is that due to the absence of gas supply, several households with children and patients etc are facing severe difficulties in cooking food,” he lamented and added that even the gas pressure was very low at the time of sehri.
Another citizen Waqas, a resident of Block-C, Satellite Town, also expressed serious concerns over low gas pressure and demanded the government ensure proper gas supply so that people do not face any problems during the holy month.
On the other hand, the general manager of Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited was contacted to get his comment but he did not attend the call.
