0,Judiciary on Imran’s side unlike Nawaz: lawyers,Analysts believe next couple of weeks crucial for holding Punjab elections,"The successful return of PTI chief Imran Khan from the Judicial Complex in Islamabad where he appeared for a hearing in the Toshakhana reference has senior lawyers believing that he holds sway over judiciary unlike PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif.
Political analysts believe that the next couple of weeks will be crucial to decide whether the Punjab Assembly elections would be held on time or something would happen out of the box to curtail Imran’s pressure.
It is being witnessed that the PTI chief has given directions to his followers to question the authority of the security establishment as he blames it for his current troubles on the political front.
Reportedly, there is severe trust deficit between Imran and the 'powerful circles'. Imran was also among those who made controversies regarding the nominations of army chief before the process even started.

On the other hand, the major ruling political parties – PML-N, PPP and JUI-F) want to obtain advantage from the prevailing political situation. However, their big challenge is not the popularity of Imran but the worsening economic condition of the country.
Though Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar agreed for a political dialogue with the PTI, the PDM leadership has disassociated itself from the law minister’s offer.
Political analysts say that the major ruling parties are convinced that it is difficult for them to confront Imran in the political field at the present. These parties are more interested in getting him disqualified from the court of law.
However, political analysts did not see these ruling parties gain any advantage if Imran is disqualification before the elections.
A senior PTI leader is hopeful that their relationship with the establishment will improve and signs in this regard will begin to appear soon.
Debate has also started on available options for powerful circles in case they fail to curtail Imran.
One of the top legal minds of a ruling party expressed his apprehension that if the situation will get out of control then any step can be taken by powerful circles.
Therefore, the next two weeks are very curicial.
However, role of the superior judiciary will be significant in the prevailing political situation.

The PTI’s main objective is to linger the Toshakhana case till the general elections of the National Assembly. The role of Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial will be significant in this connection.
The chief justice is known as a ‘balancing judge’ who does not give a free hand to one side to suppress the other since April last year.
He is retiring in September this year. His legacy is dependent on holding of the general elections during his tenure. However, the Supreme Court itself is facing a crisis of polarisation wherein judges are questioning each other’s conduct in their judicial orders.
Likewise, powerful circles are also upset over the suo motu proceedings regarding the holding of general elections of Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa assemblies within 90 days. CJP Bandial is among those judges who did not pass coercive orders against the powerful circles.
The apex court is still facing a shortage of two judges. The senior judges could not evolve a consensus on the nominees for their elevation to the SC.
It is witnessed that after the happenings in the last couple of weeks, it is not just Imran but the judiciary is also facing a trial.
The PDM-led government wants Imran disqualified before the general elections.
It has been learnt that the PTI’s legal team has decided to approach the superior courts against the PDM leaders, who acquired gifts from the Toshakhana at lower prices.
Polirisation has increased in every segment of society. Judges as well as bars are also divided.
Senior lawyers say that if powerful circles take any step to tackle the PTI then the role of judiciary will be significant. Senior lawyers are criticising Imran for using party workers as protective shields in order to avert his possible arrest. They say that Imran is setting a bad precedent which may follow his rivals in case of their possible arrest.
Senior lawyers belonging to major political parties believe that unlike Nawaz, Imran has support of one section of judiciary.

1,Imran’s ‘fascist and militant tendencies’ laid bare: PM,"Sanaullah claims bombs were recovered from Zaman Park, hints at banning PTI","After days of boiling tensions and escalating violence, which culminated in the raid on Zaman Park on Saturday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that if anyone had any doubt, PTI Chairman Imran Khan’s “antics” of the last past few days had “laid bare his fascist and militant tendencies”.
On his Twitter handle, the premier said, “From using people as human shields to throwing petrol bombs at police to leading ‘jathas’ to intimidate judiciary, he (Imran) has taken a leaf out of the RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) book.”
Separately, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb, while addressing a press conference, said that all state institutions were responsible for the establishment of the writ of the government.
Allowing the accused to come to courts with crowds would give a message that the justice system and law in Pakistan were afraid of terrorists, thugs, goons, threats and abuses, she added.
The minister claimed that Imran was not afraid of playing with national interests, hatching conspiracies and blatantly violating the law and the Constitution of Pakistan.
The federal government also indicated initiating the legal procedure to ban the former ruling party.
Federal Minister for Interior Rana Sanaullah, while addressing a presser at the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz’s (PML-N) secretariat in Model Town, Lahore, said that enough things have come to light to file a reference against PTI, and PML-N’s legal team is now considering. He added that a party can only be banned through the courts.
He said that the Punjab Police acted in a no-go area with the help of other law enforcement agencies. “A so-called political leader had created an atmosphere of fear,” he said, taking a jibe at Imran, and added that he was running a movement to avoid jail “as a woman”.
He said that when there was “resistance” to the compliance of the court’s order, the impression was strengthened that there might be a terrorist organisation there. He added that 65 persons had been arrested from outside of the former prime minister’s house, most of whom do not belong to Punjab and their role is “suspicious”, while weapons, grenades, and petrol bomb-making equipment were also recovered from there.
Sanaullah claimed that Imran’s aim is to spread sedition and anarchy in the country, and he had been “pursuing his agenda for the last 10 years”. He added that the PTI chief was “willing to riot” even when he was in the government.
The PML-N leader claimed that Imran reached the court premises with a group of at least 300 to 400 armed men. He added that the police had to use force to remove the people.
He alleged that the former premier uses the notion of threat to life as an excuse.
“They know they are lying because they want to avoid legal action, so they talk about security threats,” he added.
Meanwhile, Maryam Nawaz, the chief organiser of PML-N, rejected the PTI chief’s claim that his wife Bushra Bibi was alone at his Zaman Park residence in Lahore when Punjab police conducted a ‘surprise search operation’ there earlier today.
Reacting to his statement, Maryam in a series of tweets, said that if there was only a woman present inside the house then who was “firing bullets and throwing petrol bombs at the police from inside?”
She also shared a purported video – which others claimed to be fake – on her Twitter timeline wherein a man can be seen throwing some explosive from the PTI chief’s Lahore residence.
“Didn't I say that this [PTI] is a terrorist group whose leader is housing miscreants and trained terrorists in his house to avoid the law and punishment? Previously, such scenes were seen only in matters related to terrorism. Shameful!,” she added.
In another tweet, Maryam said brave politicians do not fear arrest and accountability. “Only thieves, bandits, and terrorists fear arrest and accountability.”
Furthermore, Federal Minister for Law Azam Nazeer Tarar, while addressing a presser, said that after the former premier appeared outside the courtroom in the Toshalhana case and his arrest warrant was cancelled, the courts should remove the impression that justice is the same for all since “it is not the same”.
He said that the court opened in the evening and gave bail in nine cases.
“It is expected from the supreme judiciary that while giving such facilities, the behaviour of the petitioner must be seen,” he added.

2,PM moves to regain lost political capital,Shehbaz announces Rs50 per litre subsidy for low-income strata,"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif announced a relief package on Sunday, providing Rs50 per litre subsidy on petrol, a move seen as an attempt to regain the lost political capital just ahead of the elections in the country’s two provinces.
The move also draws similarities to Shehbaz’s predecessor, Imran Khan, who gave Rs200 billion subsidy in April 2022. However, he could not obtain the desired result and cost the country the International Monetary Fund (IMF) bail out.
Chairing a review meeting in Lahore, the prime minister announced that the low-income individuals would receive a petroleum subsidy of up to Rs50 per litre as part of the government’s petroleum relief package.
He directed that the petroleum relief would be given to low-income consumers, who have motorcycles, rickshaws, 800 cc cars and other small vehicles. He added the petroleum subsidy programme would be started soon.
He said that motorcycles, rickshaws and small cars were used by low-income people and the petroleum subsidy would give relief to the poor. The government was making effort for all possible help to the poor people, despite economic difficulties, he added.
“A comprehensive strategy will be devised with the cooperation of relevant departments for the effective implementation of the subsidy programme,” the prime minister told the participants.
The prime minister seems to be simultaneously playing a gamble with the voters as well as the IMF. According to political pundits, chances were that the global lender might not support such a proposal.
The government has long been trying to meet the IMF conditions for the release of a $1.1bn loan tranche, which was originally due in November 2022. These measures include the Rs170 billion mini-budget. However, the IMF deal is still awaited.
Besides, the government, much to the public resentment, jacked up prices of petroleum products, increased electricity and gas tariffs, devalued currency, raised interest rate at the same time failed to rein in the inflation.
A press release from the Prime Minister Office stated that Shehbaz reviewed the petroleum relief package for lower income petroleum consumers. He said that the low-income petroleum consumers would be given relief of up to Rs50 per litre on petrol.
The meeting was attended by Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, Prime Minister’s Adviser Ahad Cheema, Special Assistant Tariq Bajwa, finance secretary, petroleum secretary, and other high-ranking officials.
It was reported earlier that the government desired to give Rs150 billion subsidised petrol package to motorcyclists and other low-income individuals in order to avoid any objection from IMF.
The government was mulling over plans to raise the petrol price for car owners and reduce it for the motorcyclists, rickshaw drivers and others. However, reportedly, the mechanism plan had not been finalised but the options included provision of one-time password, giving pre-paid cards, giving cash or by increasing fuel rates for the car owners driving above 800cc.
However, experts feel, the government’s plan to simultaneously woo voters and avoid losing IMF support is a double-edged sword as neither people would be willing to pay for government’s political adventures nor the country can afford derailment of IMF programme, again.
Since coming to power, the incumbent rulers have been accusing the previous Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)-led government of laying “landmines” to push Pakistan towards economic destruction.
In June last year, Minister of State for Petroleum Division Senator Musadik Masood Malik had said that Imran’s decision meant that he decided to take out Rs1,500 billion to be divided equally between the rich and the poor through subsidy on fuel.
“This should help you understand that this was not a decision but a landmine that was laid down to push Pakistan towards economic destruction,” he had said, adding the coalition government was not power-hungry but wanted to address core issues.
The minister of state had explained that if the prices of petroleum products were not increased for just one month then the cost incurred would have amounted to Rs100 billion to Rs120 billion.
As the elections are coming nearer, the government is trying to win back public support and in this regard, it is not only mulling over to give subsidy on fuel but also trying to get fuel from Russia at cheap rate.

3,Imran promises mammoth rally on 22nd,PTI chief accuses police of violating privacy of his home,"Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan announced on Sunday a “mega power show” at Minar-e-Pakistan in Lahore on Wednesday, the eve of the Pakistan Day celebrations.
Addressing his supporters via video link from his Zaman Park residence, Imran vowed a “mammoth rally” at Minar-e-Pakistan, which he said would be like a referendum to prove which side the nation stood.
“We are holding a mammoth public rally on Wednesday. It will be more like a referendum,” he said. It will tell the nation where the public stands and where the cabal of crooks and their handlers stand,” he added.
Previously, the PTI had announced that it would hold a public rally at Minar-e-Pakistan on Sunday. However, the Lahore High Court (LHC) had instructed the party to reschedule the rally in consultation with the district administration.
Condemning Saturday’s police action at his residence, Imran lashed out at the inspector general (IG) of the Punjab police and the officers involved in the raid. He accused the police of breaking down the main gate and exterior wall of his house.
“At the time of attack”, Imran said, “only his wife, Bushra Bibi, and a few domestic help were present. I want to ask everyone, police, army, judges and citizens about the respect of ‘Chadar and Char Dewari’ [privacy of the home] in Islam.”
The PTI chief alleged that there was video evidence that officials looted whatever they could find at his residence. “Is the police supposed to loot homes. Do you have a little shame,” he questioned.
“Exactly what is my crime? The nation knows I always abide by the law,” Imran said. “But this fascist government has registered 96 cases against me. More cases are registered, whenever I leave my house,” he added.
Imran said when he returned to Lahore the other night he was angry at the police action at his residence, therefore, he decided not give his speech. “It was good that I did not address yesterday … a person should not speak, when angry,” he maintained.
The PTI chairman reiterated that the coalition government of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) was behind the attempt on his life in Wazirabad in November last year and added that they had the support of their handlers.
Giving a recap of the recent events, Imran said after announcement of the election schedule, his party decided to kick-start its election campaign by holding a rally in Lahore on March 8.
“On the night of March 7, we finalised every detail with the police as to how the rally would proceed. We got permission. The next day, as we were about to start, the interim government imposed Section 144 and police appeared clad in riot gear,” he said.
“How could Section 144 [ban on public gatherings] be imposed after the announcement of election schedule,” Imran asked. He added that when the rally started moving, the police used water cannons and tear gas against PTI workers.
“Subsequently, I had to cancel [the rally] because I knew that they are trying to make the situation worse to find an excuse to escape the elections,” he continued. He said that there were constant attacks at his home.
The police operation at Zaman Park, the former prime minister said, was the reason he asked for shifting of the hearing of the case against him to another place in Islamabad. The F-8 Kachehry was a death trap,” he added.
About the arrest warrants, Imran said, a posse of police officers raided his residence to “implement the warrants issued by a magistrate” but when warrants for Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah were issued, no action was taken”.
Speaking about the turn of events on Saturday during his court appearance, Imran asked if he just had to mark his attendance in a court in Islamabad, why his home was being attacked from three sides.
“Yesterday, when I left my house, I said goodbyes to my wife. I had in mind that I might either be arrested or killed. Then, Rangers arrived in armoured vehicles, jumping over the walls like some commando action was taking place,” he claimed.
He added that when he reached the Toll Plaza, police had closed the motorway and only one lane was open. “They had thought that once my car left, they would close it behind me so that rest of the cars could not follow,” he said.
By this, he alleged, the government had either planned to isolate and kill him on his way to the Judicial Complex, or they wanted to arrest him and shift him to Balochistan. However, the people came out to receive and protect him.
“When we got close to the Judicial Complex, police started firing tear gas shells relentlessly. We waited outside the Judicial Complex as the situation deteriorated,” the PTI chief continued.
“I knew they will try to kill me in the crossfire if I left my car,” he charged “They have long planned to assassinate me, and I have been exposing their plans for two months,” he maintained.
