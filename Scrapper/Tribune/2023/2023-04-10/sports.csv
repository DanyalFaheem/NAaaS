0,Ducking the law: Catching proclaimed offenders remains a pipe dream,"Punjab Police has failed to prevent culprits from escaping the country, shown little interest in bringing them back","Lahore Decades long inefficiency of the Punjab Police, which has either failed to close investigations immediately or shown reluctance in arresting seemingly powerful criminals, has resulted in notorious malefactors escaping the country; rarely to be heard of again.
The routine procedure for lawbreakers who flee the country is the police asking the courts to declare them as proclaimed offenders and issue warrants for their arrest.
While these two steps might work without a hitch, criminals who escape are hardly heard of again because the police lose interest in them.
The Punjab Police’s disinterest is backed by numbers as well. Police sources privy to the matter disclosed that the province’s courts await the return of 674 proclaimed offenders, so that they can be punished for the various crimes they have been accused of, such as terrorism, fraud, kidnapping for ransom, and murder-for-hire. When asked about the police’s lack of interest in bringing back the accused from foreign jurisdictions, Inspector General (IG) Punjab Police, Dr Usman Anwar, conceded that the department had been “moving slowly.” However, what the recently appointed provincial police chief is perhaps not aware of is that the department has been moving slowly intentionally.
“Since there is barely a budget for remote investigations, it is easier for us to get an accused declared as proclaimed offender, and then wait for their arrest,” a police official in the investigative unit told The Express Tribune, under the condition of anonymity.
While using the low budget excuse is not new for government departments, the Punjab Police has failed to follow procedures which do not even involve money. For instance, if there’s an apprehension that a particular malefactor will escape the country, the police can obtain approval from the Ministry of Interior to place them on the Exit Control List (ECL); however, this procedure is largely ignored, according to police sources. Dr Anwar, when asked about this lethargy of the police force, replied: “things are now picking up speed after our discussions with Interpol.” Expanding on the discussions held with the international organisation that facilitates worldwide police cooperation, the IG informed that red notices, colloquially referred to as red warrants, would be issued for 406 proclaimed offenders.
“Moreover, red warrants for 84 proclaimed offenders have already been issued and the affected families are encouraged to report their concerns to the police,” added Dr Anwar.
While it remains to be seen whether red warrants for the 406 malefactors will be issued anytime soon, The Express Tribune learnt from police sources that the Punjab Police had recently asked the Ministry of Interior to revoke the passports of some 470 proclaimed offenders, so that they could be arrested.
However, none of the police officials privy to this information commented on why a request to revoke passports of notorious criminals was only being made now.

1,Unique mosque draws throngs of visitors,Building was constructed two decades ago with purely traditional materials,"Located around 20 kilometers from Gujrat, Masjid Pak Wiggah Sharif stands as an example of unique and modern architecture, historical and religious significance and devotion and love of Islam.
The construction of the mosque was started around 22 years ago by Dr Hafiz Mohammad Farrukh Hafeez, a resident of Kadhar Sharif. Due to his immense attachment to religion, he himself laid the foundation stone in 2001.
The mosque, composed of highly-decorated white marble, was established on an area of four kanals. Lime, mud and brick powder were mixed and used as mortar in the mosque’s construction.
The 4.5 million bricks in the foundation were connected in an arched manner to provide protection against earthquakes and cracks caused by gas emissions.
Masjid Pak Wiggah Sharif has become an image of timeless art due to its unique architecture, calligraphy and white marble exterior, which has also been beautifully decorated with calligraphy. A large number of people visit the mosque on a daily basis.
Mosque caretaker Sahibzada Ahsan Hafeez told The Express Tribune that artisans and devotees took part in the construction out of religious fervor and artistic zeal. Neither iron rods nor cement were used in the construction of the mosque. So far, around Rs19 billion was spent on building this mosque.
In the premises adjacent to the mosque, a free eye camp is organized and a weekly langar (free food) is held for visitors and worshippers.
Abdul Rahman, the mosque administrator, said that the beauty of the mosque is exemplary in every respect and can also be observed at night.
Even after the passing of Hafiz Muhammad Farrukh Hafeez, work is being carried out to maintain the mosque’s beauty with the same spirit.

2,Farmers warned of attack by ‘Lashkari Sundi’,"According to a spokesman for the Agriculture Dept, farmers should conduct pest scouting of their crops twice-a-week","Agriculture experts have warned the farmers against fall worm (Lashkari Sundi) and said that the insect caused colossal loss to maize, rice, sugarcane, cotton, fodder and vegetable crops.
According to a spokesman for the Agriculture Department, the farmers should conduct pest scouting of their crops twice-a-week and use appropriate pesticides in addition to taking other measures for saving their crops from the Lashkari Sundi as it was the most dangerous insect, especially for new crops.
He said that the farmers should plough their fields deeply to eliminate remains of their harvested crops so that eggs and larvae of the Lashkari Sundi could be destroyed.
He advised the growers to use Emmactin Benzoate+Fepronal at the rate of 8-kgs per acre; or Flubendamide 480 SC 40 milliliter per acre; or Emmactin benzoate at 240 ml per acre; or Levfenoran at 240 ml per acre; or Spintoram 120 S-C at the rate of 100 ml per acre; or Chloranthraniprol 20% S-C at the rate of 100 ml per acre.
They should choose pesticides after consulting with the local agronomists for effective chemical control of the fall worm.
The farmers could use granular poisons to control the Lashkari Sundi after consulting with the agri experts.
For this purpose, field staff of the Agriculture Department was also available, and the growers could contact them during office hours for proper information and guidance, he added.

3,"Citizens to face Rs1,000 fine over littering",Warning notice to follow penalty after repeat violation,"The Multan Waste Management Company (MWMC) is set to adopt a new strategy of imposing fine on citizens found throwing garbage in the streets and markets.
Initially, warning notices will be served on the violators, while Rs1,000 fine will be imposed over violation of the rules again within three months.
According to sources in the MWMC, the local government department has directed the municipal corporations and waste management companies across the province to implement the orders at the earliest so that action against the violators can be initiated to maintain cleanliness in the cities.
The Multan Metropolitan Corporation has designated enforcement officials for the purpose, but the MWMC has not appointed the officials so far as their list has to be sent to the commissioner for approval.
The 15 sector in charges of the company would likely be given the powers to impose fine on the violators. The amount will be deposited into the metropolitan corporation’s account, the sources added. The company is providing cleanliness services in 68 urban union councils, but there have been persistent complaints of throwing waste at places not designated by the local government.

6,Operation begins in ‘katcha’ area,"Suspected dacoit killed, policeman injured in ambush of IG’s convoy","A grand police operation got underway in Rahim Yar Khan’s Katcha area on Sunday to cleanse the area of the criminals and anti-state elements.
During the first battle of the operation on its first day, an alleged dacoit was killed while a policeman sustained injuries.
The battle started when the convoy of the Punjab Inspector General of Police, Dr. Usman Anwar, who is heading the operation, came under attack, ensuing an exchange of fire between the police and the dacoits.
Police arrested six alleged dacoits during the encounter. The RPO of Bahawalpur, Rai Babar Saeed, and the DPO of Rahim Yar Khan, Rizwan Omar Gondal, were assisting the Punjab IGP in the operation.

Police checkpoints had been fully restored in the Katcha area, and advancement was being made to clear the interior of anti-social elements, the Punjab IGP said.
“The writ of the state and the rule of law will be restored by completely stamping out the hideouts of the criminals from the Katcha area,” said the police chief.
