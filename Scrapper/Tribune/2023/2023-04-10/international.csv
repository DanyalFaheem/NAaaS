0,Goods ‘worth Rs30m’ gutted in mysterious fire,"Empty sugar sacks, other material go up in flames at a warehouse","A fire broke out at a warehouse within the limits of Pinyari police station on Sunday, with goods believed to be worth Rs30 million going up in the flames. It includes sacks, including empty sugar sacks, cardboard bags, and other items. The warehouse, owned by Abdul Waheed Qureshi, is located near the Expo Center in Noorani Basti.
According to first responders, the fire quickly engulfed the entire warehouse. It was so intense that the flames could be seen from a distance. It also triggered a panic in nearby areas. The tin roof of the warehouse also collapsed during the fire and it spread to warehouses on either side. As a result of the fire, the paper and cardboard used in preparing the paper and cardboard bags were also burnt to ashes.
The Market Fire Brigade, which was the first at the scene, called reinforcement from other stations due to the severity of the fire. They included Shaheed Inayat Ali Fire Station, Central Fire Brigade Station Latifabad and Gulshan-e-Hali. It was brought under control after several hours. Upon receiving the information about the fire, Executive Engineer (ExEn) Amjad Sheikh, ExEn Phalili Arshad Sheikh, and Liaquat Colony Sub-Division Hydro Union Chairman Sajjad Qaim Khani along with their staff arrived.
They immediately switched off the power to the entire feeder as a safety measure. When the fire was put out, power was restored to the area. The concerned officers of HESCO have clarified that the fire was not caused by a short circuit because there was no electricity connection in the warehouse and no wires had been installed inside the warehouse.

3,Candidates decry ‘nepotism’ in SPSC hiring,"Hold protest outside press club against ‘corruption’ in appointment of
lecturers","The candidates who appeared in the recruitment exams conducted by Sindh Public Service Commission (SPSC) for appointment against the seats of lecturers in the government colleges have complained of nepotism and a lack of merit in the results.
The candidates, who gathered outside Hyderabad Press Club on Sunday to protest, alleged that the SPSC has also violated the orders of the supreme court and the Sindh high court with regard to fairness in the conduct of the exams. The protesters led by Advocate Khalid Saleh, Ram Odh, Hussain Bux Chandio, Yousuf Sindhi and Rasheed Azad chanted slogans like 'no to corruption and nepotism in SPSC' and 'we want merit, transparency and justice'.
Saleh informed that the SPSC conducted the interviews of the eligible candidates for recruitment of lecturers for the subjects including English, Sindhi, political science, economics and others subjects from January to March this year. He and other protesters blamed the commission for failing to ensure transparency in the exams. Saleh said the commission neither disclosed scores of the candidates on its website nor the SHC's order concerning the marking policy was implemented.
""In some interviews, instead of a team just one person conducted the interviews,"" he claimed. Chandio claimed that even some gold medalist and master of philosophy (MPhil) qualified candidates have not been selected by the SPSC for the lecturer jobs. He also alleged that many relatives of the employees of the SPSC have been named in the merit list of the qualified candidates.
The protesters said the interview results for the English subject were declared after many days' delay on March 31 even though the commission was supposed to declare the results on the next day. They warned the SPSC that if it did not conduct the interviews again purely on the basis of merit, they will take the issue to the Sindh High Court. The SHC has already annulled the Combined Competitive Examination (CCE), 2020, results of the exams which were conducted by the SPSC through its February 23 order.
The court has directed the commission to conduct those CCE-2020 exams again.

4,Artificial jewellery shines on Eid,It is affordable and available in various designs,"With ever-increasing gold prices, gold jewellery has gone out of the reach of most people. In such situation, artificial jewellery is one of the must-buy items when women go shopping for Eid. Since it is cheap, women can afford artificial jewellery despite the neck-breaking inflation in the country.
The most popular areas for artificial jewellery shopping include Hyderi Market, Tariq Road, Bahadurabad, Jama Market, Liaquatabad, PIB, Saddar, Bohri Bazaar, Bolton Market, Gulistan-e-Johar, Shaheed-e-Millat Road, Metro Mall, Gulf Centre, Karimabad, Dolmen Mall and Hyper Star. Women say that changing the design of gold jewellery is difficult. ""Nowadays, more than 90 per cent women wear artificial jewellery on Eid, weddings, and other events,"" one woman told The Express Tribune.
""The best thing about artificial jewellery is that we can have it matching with dresses for different events,"" she added. Shopkeepers and traders say that artificial jewellery is 20-30 per cent dearer than last year. This year the variety of artificial jewellery is limited because the government has banned imports of several items due to the dollars shortage in the country. Last year earrings from China and India were popular among women, but they have simply disappeared from the market this year. In summer, women prefer light tops, pendants, bracelets, and rings instead of heavy jewellery because they have to prepare meals for their families even on Eid day. On the other hand young girls try to buy the jewellery designs they find on social media.
The outbreak of the novel coronavirus pandemic in 2020 had triggered a trend among women to shop for artificial jewellery online. This also led to more and more middle-class women entrepreneurs joining this online business and now we see a large number of ecommerce websites doing roaring business, getting orders not only from Pakistan but also from abroad. Such women are not only financially independent but also employ other women. ""Quality artificial jewellery made in modern designs is becoming expensive day by day,"" said Sana, a woman shopper on Tariq Road.
""In such a situation, it is unimaginable to buy even artificial jewellery manufactured by top brands,"" she added. Working women prefer to buy foreign artificial jewellery. ""There is no point in buying heavy and expensive artificial jewellery on occasions like Eid because these ornaments cannot be worn afterwards,"" Aliya, a working woman, told The Express Tribune. ""Light and sophisticated artificial jewellery, such as pendants and rings, can be also worn in daily life,"" she added.
According to shopkeepers, women from middle and lower middle classes prefer to buy light jewellery in the range of Rs1,500-2,000 due to the rising inflation. Such jewellery is not only attractive but also affordable. President of Bolton Market Artificial Jewellery Association, Anwar Mamo, said that there is an increasing trend among women to buy jewellery matching with their dresses. ""Because of this, jewellery with zircon gemstones has become popular,"" he said. ""Zircon jewellery can cost you from a few hundreds to thousands. The imported zircon jewellery is very expensive,"" he added. ""The best thing about zircon jewellery is that the gems never come off and if it becomes dirty or dusty, it could easily be polished again,"" he said.
Apart from main market, temporary stalls of artificial jewellery have been set up in different bazaars and markets of the city. Prices of jewellery at these stalls are reasonable compared to shops.

6,‘PTI narrative unstoppable on social media’,"'Though the rulers have gagged us on mainstream media, they cannot mute our voices on digital platforms,' says Umar","Pakistan Tehreeke-Insaaf (PTI) Secretary General Asad Umar on Sunday said the activists should be ready for elections. PTI’s narrative on social media is unstoppable, he said addressing the party workers and while talking to the media at an Iftar Party hosted by the PTI Karachi chapter head Aftab Siddiqui.
“Though the rulers have gagged us on mainstream media, they cannot mute our voices on digital platforms,” he said. “One year ago, the people of the city gathered at the Millennium Mall to recite National Anthem as a protest against the ouster of PTI government, that spirit continues to haunt the rulers,” he said addressing the party workers at an iftar party hosted by the PTI Karachi chapter head Aftab Siddiqui.
Last year, a conspiracy was hatched in the drawing rooms to topple a popularly elected government, though the clique succeeded in regime change they could not win the hearts of the people, Umar said. “No one distributed sweets on the ouster of the PTI government, rather people came out in millions to protest against the move,” he said Umar said , “The political crisis led to economic crisis. Now the engineers of the regime change are frightened and have realised that their experiment has failed,” he said.

7,Shoppers head to ‘Bachat Bazaars’ for new clothes,Families resort to belt-tightening measures for Eid preparations,"Bachat Bazaars, or markets where products are available at a discount, have made Eid shopping possible for many people from lowincome groups who would otherwise be hard pressed to afford new clothes in time of record-breaking inflation.
The bazaars have been set up by district administrations and various philanthropic organisations, offering goods at a minimum profit. One reason behind such bazaars is to allow people to continue the custom of buying new outfits and shoes for Eid.
At one such Bachat Bazaar in Gulshan-e-Iqbal area of Karachi, there are a variety of stalls offering women's unstitched clothes, children's ready-to-wear clothes, sandals and slippers, bangles, henna, and jewelry. A person selling ready-towear dresses for girls says that the price of pret has increased by 30 to 40 per cent compared to last year.
The effects of inflation have not spared Bachat Bazaars, he said, adding that sales were down 50 percent compared to last year. For the shoppers, such markets are ideal for bargain deals. One shopper told The Express Tribune that she had brought her family to the market save money. ""Some items are available at a discount while others are available at the same rate as elsewhere,"" she said. Some buyers were unhappy with the quality of the product.
""But children want new clothes and this is what I can afford,"" said another shopper with three children in tow. The shopper said he worked as a daily-wage earner and was facing difficult in finding regular work. ""I am using some of my savings, too, because it's for Eid after all."" Muhammad Shah, who runs a stall, says he has been selling slippers and sandals worth Rs200 to Rs250 at his stall. ""But many customers are not ready to buy even at this price."" Shah added that even though they had cut down on their profit margins, the buyers are still facing challenges of affordability and lack buying power.

8,Recently removed employees take varsity to task,University’s new VC has sought the approval of Sindh CM on her decision to dismiss contractual staff,"As protests by the disgruntled recently removed employees increase, Dawood Engineering University’s new leadership has thrown the ball in the Chief Minister’s (CM) court by sending a summary to his office, asking if it was justified in removing them.
The removal of employees, which was initiated by the newly appointed Vice Chancellor (VC) Professor Dr Samreen Husssain, is drawing serious flak given the prevalent double-digit inflation, which is taking no prisoners. The summary, a copy of which is available with the Express Tribune, has sought the CM’s stamp of approval on the removal of 67 non-teaching employees, 15 researchers, and 6 teachers, whose salaries apparently set the university back some Rs 3.688 million per month.
In an interview with the Express Tribune, Dr Hussain defended her decision, stating: “The contracts of these employees were already up and since there is a ban by the government on hiring, how can the university give the now removed employees a fresh contract?” The VC further said that since the only way to circumvent the ban was to ask for the CM Sindh’s approval prior to employing new people, the administration had done just that by sending a summary to his office.
However, the protesting employees do not agree with Dr Hussain’s assessment of the situation. Many who spoke to the Express Tribune pointed out that there was no government sanctioned hiring freeze in place when they were supposed to be recruited; whereas others told the Express Tribune that the former VC Dr Faizullah Abbasi had made budgetary allocations for their salaries, hence they were not a financial burden for the university.
“We have been pushed to the brink at a time when there is massive inflation and it is hard to afford a meal a day,” they regretted in unison. Apart from being removed at a time when the economy is in dire straits, part of the reason why the protestors are charged and taking the university administration to task is that Dr Hussain, the VC has sought an increase in her salary from the CM. A move, which the protesting employees have labelled as hypocrisy, given the fact that they were removed so that the university could curtail its expenses. When asked about her desire for an increase in salary especially when the university was cutting costs, Dr Hussain told the Express Tribune that this was her right under the pay protection rules.
The pay protection rules serve to provide cover to government employees, who were making a higher amount in their previous role and are thus entitled to the same salary in a new role - a point that Dr Hussain raised with the Sindh government prior to her appointment as VC. Subsequently, the provincial government approved a salary of Rs 1,250,000 for Dr Hussain. When asked why the seven figure salary was not enough for her now, the VC replied: “there are other VCs who are taking much more. I also have to pay upwards of Rs 300,000 in taxes on the current salary.”
While it remains to be seen whether the VC will get the CM’s approval for removing the employees or an increase in pay, government sources privy to the matter told the Express Tribune that accepting or rejecting the summary regarding the employees was no easy task for the CM. If the CM were to approve the removals then it was unlikely that the VC’s request for an increase in salary would be granted, a source close to the CM disclosed to The Express Tribune.

9,Man kills daughter to ‘appease’ new wife,Tells police she was jealous of the child's beauty,"A man allegedly killed his eight-year-old daughter because his second wife was jealous of the child's beauty. Police said that Naveed Khuhawar confessed during interrogation that he killed the child, who had blue eyes and a fair complexion, because his second wife was 'sick of her beauty and wanted him to get rid of her'.
Khuhawar's told police that he had a son and daughter with his first wife who he had divorced. His son was living with Khuhawar's sister. Investigators added that Khuhawar had asked his relatives to adopt the girl. But when everyone refused and his wife threatened to leave him, he threw the girl in the Indus River and faked her disappearance, Khuhawar told investigators.
The girl had been missing since October and the family had been protesting for greater efforts to the find the missing girl. Last month, the chief justice of the Sindh High Court took notice of the case and sought a detailed report. The court summoned the Larkana senior superintendent of police along with investigation officer of the case and instructed them to submit a report to the court in person. It resulted in an accelerated investigation for which the girl's father and some other relatives were detained and interrogated.
It was during this interrogation that Khuhawar confessed to the crime, police said. The accused said his second wife had threatened to leave me if his ""blue-eyed"" daughter was not taken care. Finding no other way out, he told police, he threw the innocent girl into the river and remained silent.
