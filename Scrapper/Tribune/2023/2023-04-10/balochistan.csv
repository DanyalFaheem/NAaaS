0,Students of FDE-run schools await textbooks,Official says schools to open today instead of April 1 due to delayed delivery,"The students of Federal Directorate of Education (FDE) run institutes in the federal capital have not yet received free compulsory textbooks even though the authorities concerned have announced the opening of schools from Monday (today).
According to sources, the current situation has created hurdles for students to begin their academic activities.
They said the FDE provides free textbooks to the students of all the institutes from Class I-10 every year but this time, it has failed to provide the school books, causing difficulties for the teachers to complete the course in reduced sessions.
Sources said students have been instructed to come to school from Monday although they were supposed to join their classes on April 1.
Rifat Jabeen who looks after the affairs of the distribution of free textbooks at FDE said the institutes do not have books to distribute among the students due to which their academic activities are at risk of suffering.
Moreover, the authorities concerned have not yet given a final date for the delivery of the books, she added.
On the other hand, the annual results of class V have been delayed due to a new experiment. Sources said previously, the directorate itself used to conduct exams of the said class by appointing teachers for the examinations. However, a new experiment was made this year whereby examinations were conducted under area education officers. Even during these examinations, too many complaints were received and now there is a continuous delay in the results, they said.
This is not the first time that the students are being delayed books.
In 2021, a similar situation arose after authorities concerned failed to meet the deadline for the distribution of the books.
At the time, all the eighth graders of schools being run under the FDE were not provided textbooks although the academic session had started after a delay.

1,Junior officer appointed to key post at RMC,Move comes only three days after a senior officer was appointed to the same post,"A junior officer has been appointed to a key post at the Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation just three days after the appointment of a senior officer to the same post.
Sources said that earlier Zahid Abbas was appointed to the most important post of Superintendent Regulations on April 3, but four days later, the said appointment was withdrawn. In his place, Masood Mughal, a most junior officer, was appointed to the position on April 7.
According to the sources, Abbas was on the seniority list after the retirement of former superintendent regulations Javed Ahmed. The sources said that Abbas performed duty as the Superintendent Regulations for two days and received greetings. The promotion letter was also issued with the signature of the chief officer.
The sources said that Mughal, who was fourth on the seniority list, was appointed the Superintendent Regulations in gross violation of the seniority list. The seniority was violated after the alleged intervention of a political figure in Rawalpindi.
According to the sources, Masood Mughal's letter was also issued with a backdate of 03.4.2023 vide letter No. 202 and issued hastily on the political recommendation.

He said the people are bearing the brunt of the politicians' mistakes.

7,PIMS embroiled in fresh waste handling controversy,Hazardous medical refuse from the hospital ends up in front of girls’ school,"The Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) – the federal capital’s largest government hospitala - is faced with a fresh round of controversy over the unsafe handling of its medical waste weeks after a similar controversy that resulted in the suspension of three employees.
Sources have revealed that a large amount of medical waste from the hospital is being dumped in a hazardous manner outside a government girls' school in Sector G-7.
A video of a trolley loaded with medical waste being unloaded outside the school first surfaced on social media in which the waste could be seen originating from the PIMS Hospital, ending up at an unauthorised place.
Sources said that the illegal activity is taking place with the connivance of higher authorities.
The sources expressed concern over the potential hazard caused by the open dumping of medical waste. The waste is reportedly being transported to other locations for recycling.
This is not the first time PIMS has been embroiled in controversy over the handling of its medical waste.
Just a few weeks ago, three employees of the PIMS Hospital were suspended for selling medical waste, and the head of administration was given a clean chit in the case.
Experts say that medical waste should be disposed of properly so that it does not become a source of infection.
Unsafe handling of medical waste poses extreme hazards to human health and spreads diseases among humans, they said.
On the other hand, sources alleged that authorities concerned have done little to curb the practice.
