0,"Finance secretary to attend WB, IMF spring meetings",Ministry denies reports Hamed Sheikh goes on leave,"A high-level Pakistani delegation led by Finance Secretary Hamed Yaqoob Sheikh has arrived in Washington to attend the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings as concerns mount that a combination of sticky high interest rates and lacklustre global growth could push a number of economies that are facing soaring refinancing needs into debt difficulties next year.
The secretary would represent Pakistan in the absence of Finance Minister Ishaq Dar as delegation head after the former cancelled his trip to Washington on the prime minister’s orders, citing political turmoil in the country.
However, the minister assured the nation that the IMF deal was on track and the government had already done all that was required from it to conclude the ninth review of the loan programme. “These are routine rituals. However, a constitutional crisis has been created in Pakistan,” Dar had said in a televised address.
Moreover, the finance ministry on Monday rebutted claims that Sheikh went on leave. “It is clarified that the finance secretary has gone to the US to attend spring meetings of the IMF and the World Bank and to represent the finance minister,” according to the ministry.
EAD Secretary Dr Kazim Niaz is also attending the spring meetings.
The global lenders’ spring meetings kick off this week with an ambitious reform and fundraising agenda. ""Despite the remarkable resilience of consumer spending in the US, in Europe, despite the uplift from China’s reopening, global growth would remain below three percent"" in 2023, IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva told a news conference on Monday.

The fund now expects global growth to remain at close to three percent for the next half decade -- its lowest medium-term prediction since the 1990s.
Many weaker economies navigated the fallout from the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine with financing aid from multilateral and bilateral lenders.
But repayments on emerging markets' high-yield international bonds will total $30 billion in 2024, a steep increase compared to the $8.4 billion left for the remainder of this year.
Tapping international debt markets hasn't been a problem across the board for emerging economies. Sovereign issuance has hit a record high so far this year, although that bond sale bonanza has been driven by higher rated sovereigns.
Meanwhile countries such as Tunisia, Kenya and Pakistan ""would need to find alternative sources of financing if the market doesn't re-open for them,"" said Thys Louw, portfolio manager for the emerging markets hard currency debt strategy at Ninety One, in London.
""In Tunisia and Pakistan, the finalisation of the IMF programme will be an important step to avoiding a default as that would unlock bilateral and multilateral financing,"" added Louw.
Ahead of the spring meetings, the IMF and World Bank also called on wealthier countries to help plug a $1.6-billion hole in a concessional lending facility for low-income countries that was heavily used during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Many low-income countries are now facing mounting debt burdens due in part to the higher interest-rate environment, which is also leading to capital outflows from many of the countries most in need of investment.
""For many of the developing countries it looks like they're in a phase of decapitalization rather than recapitalization,"" World Bank president David Malpass said on Monday. ""That's gravely concerning.""
Malpass and Georgieva will use this year's spring meetings to try and make progress on stalled debt restructuring reforms.

2,Marriyum calls PTI white paper ‘pack of lies’,Minister says this couldn’t cover his ‘corruption and incompetence’,"Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb on Sunday said that PTI Chairman Imran Khan could not justify his “evil deeds”, including “corruption and incompetence”, by simply issuing a white paper.
“Whether he issues white, red or yellow paper, nothing can help Imran Khan cover up his corruption and incompetency besides violation of the constitution he committed during his government’s tenure,” the minister said in a news statement while reacting to the PTI’s chief remarks.
She said that it was the ruling alliance that had made concerted efforts to steer the country out of economic crises created by the previous government.
“How can Imran Khan, who himself plunged the country into an economic quagmire which ushered in sheer poverty, extreme inflation, and massive unemployment, question the performance of a government which came into power just one year ago?” the minister wondered.
She said that a person who brought the country to the brink of default issued a white paper that ironically had no mention of the circular debt in the power sector, which jumped to Rs2,400 billion from Rs1,100 billion during his own government’s tenure.
There was also no mention of circular debt in the energy sector which soared to Rs1,400 billion during the PTI’s government tenure, she added.
Marriyum said Imran had not also dared to mention the “wrong policies” of his government which resulted in a whooping increase in the prices of wheat and sugar that went up to Rs100 from Rs35 per kg and Rs120 from Rs52 per kg, respectively.
The minister said that the PTI government had taken record loans of Rs20,000 billion which was also not mentioned in the white paper. It was the coalition government that had returned $11 billion in one year, she added, mentioning that budget deficit was also absent from the white paper.
Marriyum further said that the former prime minister had angered almost every friendly country by pursuing “wrong policies” during his four years rule.
She also termed the white paper as a “pack of lies”.

3,Imran’s ‘wish for default’ won’t come true: Abbasi,Participants of PML-N huddle in Rawalpindi say economic situation will improve soon,"PML-N stalwart Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and other party leaders on Sunday maintained that PTI Chairman Imran Khan's desire to bankrupt the country or push it towards default would never be fulfilled.
“Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has saved the country from bankruptcy. [PM Shehbaz took over] the government [when it was] caught in the vortex of economic and social conditions in a constitutional manner [and handled the matters],” the former premier said while addressing the guests at an iftar dinner hosted by a former MPA of the PP-16 constituency of Rawalpindi.
He added that free flour was being distributed among the deserving people of the country by reducing government expenditure.
Abbasi further claimed that the PML-N was the only party engaged in serving the people by bringing facilities to their doorsteps.
He pointed out that 100 million deserving people would be provided with free flour through one of the biggest schemes launched in the country.
“This scheme has been launched, setting aside political point scoring, only with the spirit of humanitarian service to provide relief to the people during the holy month of Ramazan,” he maintained.
“The poor Pakistanis, who will receive the free flour, will pray for the integrity of Pakistan,” he added.
The PML-N leader claimed that had the PTI still remained in power, the country would have defaulted on its external repayments by now.
He continued that the PML-N was closely monitoring the country’s economy.
Abbasi maintained that the current rulers were forced to make tough decisions because the Imran-led government had destroyed the economy.
He added that the country was in the midst of financial difficulties, but he could claim that the country would never default.
The former premier noted that creating an atmosphere of uncertainty was enmity with the country, adding that the economic situation would improve soon.
Speaking on the occasion, former PML-N MNA Hanif Abbasi said the era of conspiracies had passed and party supremo Nawaz Sharif would return to the country soon.
He added that the PML-N was like a family.
Hanif noted that the country’s economy was under pressure, but claimed that the situation would improve soon.
“We have to face these problems together,” he added.
Hanif claimed that the PML-N would sweep the polls across the country, especially in Rawalpindi.
Former PML-N senator Chaudhry Tanveer Khan said difficulties could be overcome by implementing the Constitution as well as laws and development was possible.
However, he added that the country could not develop in a state of uncertainty.
He said the Almighty had granted his special grace to Pakistan and despite difficulties, the country would never default.
He pointed out that political stability could lead to improvement in the economic situation.
“Instead of going after each other, the country ‘s interest should be considered first,” the ex-senator said, while advising political rivals.
He continued that criticising and ridiculing each other could only make matters worse, and not improve them.
“Pakistan is not the country of one person or group, it is the country of all of us,” he added.
The former senator maintained that the PML-N would not rest easy even if Nawaz became the premier for the fourth time.
Addressing the ceremony, Begum Tahira Aurangzeb said Nawaz was the heartbeat of millions of people of this country.
She added that the PML-N supremo could not be removed from the hearts of the people unjustly.
Former mayor Sardar Naseem, Barrister Daniyal Tanveer Chaudhry, Haji Parvez Khan, Raja Haneef Advocate, Rahat Quddusi, Sheikh Arsalan Hafeez, and Zaibun Nisa Awan also spoke on the occasion.
They maintained that the present government was in strong hands and those who pushed the country to the brink of default had to face defeat.
They added that because of the joint efforts of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), the country had overcome its crises.

4,Two TTP terrorists arrested from Karachi,"Rangers spokesperson says they were involved in extortion, target killings","The Sindh Rangers and police, in a joint operation conducted on the basis of intelligence, claimed to have arrested two terrorists of the proscribed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
According to the Rangers' spokesperson, the terrorists were identified as Muhammad Kamal Khan and Abdul Qadir.
They were involved in extortion and cases of target killings of traders in different areas of Karachi including Sadr, Mangopir and Banaras. Kamal Khan is the leader of the group.
According to the spokesperson, a businessman from Karachi had lodged a complaint that he was being called from different numbers in Afghanistan and Pakistan and the callers were demanding extortion money from him.
The terrorists, who were involved in extortion and target killings, used to get instructions from a TTP terrorist, Afsar Khan alias Arshad, who is in Afghanistan.
The arrested terrorists would share the mobile numbers of local businessmen of Karachi with Afsar Khan in Afghanistan.
The spokesperson further revealed that when the terrorists would receive extortion money from the traders, they sent the money to Afghanistan. If a trader refused to give money, they would either injure him or kill him, he added.
During the initial investigation, the terrorists confessed to sharing the mobile numbers of Karachi's five businessmen with their boss in Afghanistan. They also confessed to giving extortion slips and killing two businessmen for non-payment of extortion money.
The spokesperson said that the terrorists have been handed over to police which would take further action against them.

5,PM’s aide slams PTI’s ‘false propaganda’ on economy,Bilal Kayani says it’s because of PTI that Pakistan stands on the brink of bankruptcy,"Prime Minister's Coordinator for Economy and Energy Bilal Kayani on Sunday that the PTI is spreading “false propaganda” about the economy, but people should not forget the economic destruction done during their era and because of them, the country is close to bankruptcy.
Addressing a news conference in Islamabad, the coordinator alleged that PTI chief Imran Khan weakened the country's economy in four years.
He said that the previous government pushed 20 million people into poverty.
When Imran Khan got the government, the inflation rate was three percent, he added.
He also said that 6 million people became unemployed during Imran’s tenure, while the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) brought 12,000 megawatts of electricity to the system in its previous term and only Nawaz Sharif ended the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) programme.
Kayani said that those who talked about loans used to say that they would create a debt commission, but Imran took record loans which are up to 78 percent in the country's history.
Imran destroyed the country's economy with his “incompetence and theft”, he alleged, adding that PTI brought the country to the brink of bankruptcy.
He said that the credit for the end of load shedding in the country goes to the government of Nawaz, while the increase in circular debt in the electricity and gas sectors occurred during the government of Imran.
“For his chair, Imran Khan sank the raft of the economy,” the coordinator claimed, adding that along with the destruction of the economy, theft was also a “privilege” of the Imran government.
He said that Imran damaged the economy during his tenure to please the furnace oil lobby. He allowed exports during his tenure to please the flour and sugar mafia, he claimed.

These activities have been meticulously laid out by a Parliamentary Advisory Committee, constituted by the Speaker, drawing Members from both Houses of Parliament and headed by senator Main Raza Rabbani.
The Speaker said that this day reminds us of the historic occasion when, 50 years ago, our forefathers unanimously adopted the 1973 Constitution.
This was the result of the tremendous efforts and wisdom of Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, who brought all political parties together on one platform to sign this historic document. He added that the entire nation pays tribute to the framers and signatories of the 1973 Constitution.
The Speaker will inaugurate the celebrations by laying the foundation stone of the Constitution Monument at the site approved by the Advisory Committee, opposite Parliamentary Lodges, D-Chowk, in Islamabad.

7,Khunjerab reopening to further bolster cross-border trade: official,Pass connecting officially resumed the entry and exit of passengers this week,"The reopening of Khunjerab Pass, a major land port on the Pakistan-China border in northwest China’s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, would further bolster bilateral trade between the two brotherly countries, besides strengthening people-to-people contacts, a senior official said.
The pass connecting officially resumed the entry and exit of passengers this week after a closure of three years in wake of Covid-19 restrictions.
The port authorities on the Chinese side were instructed to take all necessary measures regarding Covid-19 pandemic before the start of the arrival of goods from Pakistan.
Similarly, Pakistani border authorities were also instructed to take all measures regarding Covid-19, ensuring the containment of the disease.
At present, in wake of cold weather and lack of oxygen in the high altitude, Khunjerab Pass generally opens from April 1 to November 30 every year and remains closed from December 1 to March 31 of the following year.
However, Pakistan Ambassador to China, Moinul Haque in a statement said that the resumption of operations via Khunjerab Pass would serve to further bolster trade and people-to-people linkage between Pakistan and China.
He also informed that the two sides were now working to keep the border crossing open all year round.
“It was also another good omen that the two sides were now working to keep the border crossing open round the year,” Coordinator to Federal Tax Ombudsman Mehr Kashif Younis said while talking to a delegation of industrialists and traders.
The reopening was expected to witness a huge growth of cross-border trade and transportation this year. A major turnaround for Pakistani producers was expected in the wake of the relaxation of COVID-19-related restrictions.
He said that cherry had been allowed to be exported to China and this would open up a market of up to USD 2 billion. Similarly, sesame seed export to China had also increased, he added.
The textiles, rice, cherry, mangoes and other food items could be exported to Beijing, which would be another effective way of increasing foreign reserves, he added.
Talking to APP during his recent visit to Beijing, Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiative, Ahsan Iqbal termed the reopening of pass a very positive development after three years and expressed confidence that the trade between Pakistan and China would resume through land route.
He hoped that the Khunjerab border facility would be upgraded by both sides so that it could remain open for 12 months and it becomes an all-weather facility.
He said that particularly people in Gilgit-Baltistan would greatly benefit from local trade through this border post.
Iqbal said that efforts were being made to resume bus service between Pakistan and China through Khunjerab Pass to provide economical means of transportation to Pakistani students studying in China.
As per official data, the import and export cargo volume at the Khunjerab Pass topped 200,000 tonnes from 2016 to 2020.

8,House resolutions demand same day polls,Nation-wide elections under caretaker set-ups stressed,"In a concerted move, resolutions calling for general elections across the country on the same day were rushed though the joint session of parliament, the Senate and Sindh and Balochistan assemblies.
The resolutions rejected the Supreme Court verdict ordering early polls in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa to comply with the constitutional provision of 90 days.
The caretaker cabinet of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa demanded simultaneous elections of the National and provincial assemblies in the country.

The cabinet also expressed its reservations over the Supreme Court’s order for holding the elections of the Punjab Assembly in May as the same would impact the National Assembly election in that province.
It asked the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to hold the elections of both National and provincial assemblies under the Election Act on the same day.
In Quetta, the Balochistan Assembly passed a resolution regarding holding the elections of the National and Provincial Assemblies on the same day.
The session was held under the chairmanship of Speaker Mir Jan Muhammad Jamali. Provincial Minister of Home and Tribal Affairs, Mir Ziaullah Langu presented a resolution to hold the elections of National and Provincial Assemblies simultaneously in the whole country.
The Sindh Assembly adopted a resolution to hold the elections of the national and provincial assemblies at the same time across the country under caretaker governments.
""Under Article 176 of the Constitution, the Supreme Court comprises of chief justice and other judges and power under Article 184 vests with the honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan not with only a particular judge,” stated the resolution.
The resolution, moved by PPP MPA Ghanwer Ali Isran, stated that the recent controversy over the Supreme Court’s decision to take suo motu notice on the issue of elections in Punjab and K-P.

The resolutions came as Finance Minister Ishaq Dar tabled the Money Bill 2023 before the National Assembly (NA) to decide and discuss funds allocation for the provincial assemblies of Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) elections.
The two identical resolutions were moved by Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Murtaza Javed Abbasi and Senator Kamran Murtaza, aimed to promote political stability and foster unity among the provinces.
The resolutions – expressing the will of the parliamentarians – emphasized the significance of neutral caretaker set-ups under Article 224 to ensure impartiality and fairness during the elections.
The parliamentarians were of the view that organizing general elections of all the assemblies simultaneously, in accordance with Article 218, was crucial to attain genuine political and economic stability.
The resolutions also argued that holding separate elections in Punjab would inevitably impact the outcome of more than 50 per cent of the National Assembly seats in general elections. Therefore, it could potentially marginalize the smaller provinces’ role in the federation.

9,SC reserves verdict on govt’s appeal,AGP Awan says 'no room for curative review' in Constitution," 
Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial on Monday reserved his decision on the government's appeal through which it sought the withdrawal of the curative review reference filed against Justice Qazi Faez Isa by the ousted Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government.
The appeal seeks to withdraw its curative review petition against a court order that accepted the review petitions challenging the court’s June 19, 2020, judgment on the presidential reference presidential reference against Justice Qazi Faez Isa in which the court had empowered the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to conduct an inquiry into the assets of the judge’s family.
Earlier, the registrar’s office (RO) had returned a set of nine curative review petitions on May 25, 2021 filed by the PTI-led government on the grounds that the petitions contained “scandalous language”. The SC office also observed that a second review petition could not be filed against a decision already given on a review petition. The RO had highlighted that the curative appeals contained many other deficiencies.
Subsequently, the federal government had lodged an appeal before the SC against the refusal by the RO to entertain unheard of legal remedy — curative review petition — in the Justice Isa case.
However, on March 30, the PDM government led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif ordered the withdrawal of the curative review reference as the government decided to not pursue the matter further.

Speaking to journalists after CJ Bandial completed the in-chamber hearing, Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Awan revealed that the government has submitted that ""in our Constitution, there is no room for a second review or curative review"".
""In India, a second review was filed after a court judgment which was decided in 2002 following which the Supreme Court of India amended its rules and created a provision for curative review, pursuant to that judgment"" he explained.
""That amendment was followed by judicial proceedings,"" he said, ""whereas in this case there was an objection on the administrative side by the RO, against which there exists a remedy in the rules"".
""At that time (when the reference was filled) the government did not avail that remedy, [but] this government is no longer interested in availing the remedy, it seeks to withdraw that appeal,"" said AGP Awan.
""If the withdrawal order goes through then the consequence will be that the office order will be sustained, and that will be the end of it.""
He did not reveal further details about the proceedings, however.

The AGP also declined to comment on a journalist's question about the maintainability of a reference against a CJ according to the constitution.
It may be noted here that earlier this month, the country’s top security czar had said the incumbent coalition government may file references against the three SC judges including CJP Bandial who heard and decided on the plea against the postponement of polls in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P).
“The possibility of filing references against the judges cannot be ruled out,” Federal Minister for Interior Rana Sanaullah had said while talking to Express News’ anchor Rehman Azhar.
