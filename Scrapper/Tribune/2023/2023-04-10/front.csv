0,River Indus delta shrinking: UN,Global convention will help achieve UN SDGs by 2030,"The shrinking delta of River Indus has emerged on the United Nations’ radar after it accepted to create a global convention on all deltas of the world to ensure its protection against rising climate change impacts casting serious impact on its nature and habitat.
The development occurred after a strong international civil society nexus of experts, academicians, policymakers and stakeholders unanimously raised their voices for an international UN Convention for the Conservation River Delta (UN-CCRD) on the sequel of its UN Human Rights Declaration, UN Geneva Pact and many others to ensure that all the major deltas of the world were dying due to adverse impacts of climate change and environmental degradation namely sea intrusion, sea level rise, droughts, depleting water flows, shrinking creeks and others.
The African Centre for Climate Actions and Rural Development Initiative (ACCARD), in collaboration with Nigeria's Bayelsa State Government, the Institute for Environmental Diplomacy and Security at the University of Vermont, the Consortium for Capacity Building at the University of Colorado, Transboundary Water In-Cooperation Network (TWIN), Water Environment Forum-Pakistan, Center for the Advancement of Public Action (CAPA) Bennington College; Vietnam National University, Hanoi, Vietnam and Center for Environment and Sustainable Livelihood Projects (CESLP) and others, hosted a side event at the UN Water conference titled ""Integrative Highland to Ocean (H2O) Action for Disappearing Deltas: Towards a UN Convention on Conserving River Deltas.
Former senator and federal minister for information and broadcasting and World Environment Forum (WEF) chairman, participated virtually to represent Pakistan in the sideline event whereas Freeman Elohor Oluowo of ACCARD and Prof Dr Asim Zia, the director of Institute for Environmental Diplomacy, Vermont physically participated in the session.
The global convention would help in achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved by 2030 namely SDG-6 demanding ""Clean Water"", SDG-13 ""Climate Action"", and SDG-14 ""Conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas and marine resources"".
The announcement comes after a successful campaign of the above-mentioned coalition of non-governmental and civil society organisations who started the drive for a global convention of the UN to protect deltas.
The speakers and experts discussed deltas starting from the Nigerian Niger Delta, Indus Delta of Pakistan, Mekong River, Colorado, Nile, and St Lawrence transboundary river basins.
Each of these deltas possessed varying risks owing to spiking sea levels and saltwater intrusion from the oceans and rapidly melting glaciers, increasing dams, and shifting rainfall patterns in the highlands.
The UN had accepted that all the world deltas were under threat and sea level rise and intrusion were causing damage to soil and water ecosystems. It is not only nature but rather the communities, the livelihood opportunities, and human lives that were diminishing and demanded the world to respond for their protection.
There will be various activities in Delta countries towards achieving the UN Convention for the Conservation River Delta.
As per the UN SDGs website, the United Nations Convention for the Conservation River Deltas (UN-CCRD) objectives are to strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity among delta communities and water stakeholders to climate-related hazards and natural disasters through increased knowledge sharing, partnerships, global attention, UN recognition, and community participation.
It also aims to build a regional to global stakeholders’ dialogue not only to identify but to also proffer integrative Highlands to Oceans (H2O) solutions to growing water-related challenges particularly those potentiated by climate change.
Moreover, it also aims to enhance the local capacity of countries through training and capacity building, including community data gathering and community-based context-sensitive solutions to these complex problems.

1,Bilawal vows to fight off threat to Constitution,Zardari says parliament is ‘biggest court of country’ as it belongs to people,"The PPP on Sunday pledged to defeat the mindset that considered the Constitution as “just a piece of paper”, saying the document has been under attack ever since it was framed but the party would not hesitate from rendering any sacrifice necessary to protect it.
Amid the political volatility and a face-off between the government and the judiciary, the PPP leadership has made it clear that parliament was the “biggest court of the country” as it belonged to the people and everyone would have to surrender before its will.
The top PPP leadership said those who treated the document, which guaranteed rights to people as a piece of paper, believed that they were beyond the law and the Constitution was their enemy.
It added that the country was facing several difficulties today as some elements had deviated from the Constitution.
“The PPP stands by the Constitution and the democratic system as always,” party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, who is also the country’s foreign minister, said in a statement.
He added that his party was determined to finally defeat the mindset that considered the Constitution as “just a piece of paper”.
The PPP chairman’s statement was apparently in response to the remarks of the late former military ruler, Gen (retd) Pervez Musharraf, who had once said: “I think the Constitution is just a piece of paper to be thrown in the dustbin.”
Bilawal said the Constitution had been under attack ever since it was framed, saying some elements did not tolerate the fact that the people received their due rights, the provinces owned their resources, and all were equal before the law.
“The approach that considers itself beyond the law considers the 1973 Constitution as its enemy,” the PPP chairman said.
He added that the history of the PPP in terms of framing and safeguarding the Constitution was unparalleled.
Bilawal said his mother, former premier Benazir Bhutto, and father, ex-president Asif Ali Zardari, had restored the 1973 Constitution to its original form by successfully removing the “dictatorial pollution” enacted into the document by military dictators Gen Ziaul Haq and Musharraf.
Zardari, who is also the PPP co-chairperson, said the restoration of the 1973 Constitution to its original form was the mission of Benazir's life.
He added that the task was achieved through the 18th Constitutional Amendment.
The father and son congratulated the nation in their messages on the occasion of the golden jubilee of the 1973 Constitution.
They both expressed their determination to render any sacrifice necessary for the protection of the Constitution.
Amid the ongoing tussle between the government and judiciary, the former president said the elected parliament of Pakistan was the “biggest court of the country” as it belonged to the people.
“All would have to surrender before this court,” he added.
Zardari said the country was facing difficulties today as some elements had deviated from the Constitution.
He added that therefore, now was the time that the Constitution was followed for the sake of the nation and country.
“The power to make future decisions for the country should be left to parliament,” he continued.
In his message on the golden jubilee of the 1973 Constitution, Bilawal said the document was the country's national agenda and bond of the federation.
He added that the Constitution was a gift of his maternal grandfather, PPP founder and former premier Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, to the nation.
The PPP chairman saluted all the political leaders, who played their role in creating a unanimous Constitution for the nation, adding that after August 14, 1947, the second most important day in the country's history was April 10, 1973 -- the date when it was framed.
Bilawal said the Constitution of 1973 was a true reflection of Pakistan.
“As Pakistan is a federal state, our Constitution is a federal Constitution; our country is an Islamic country, so the spirit of our Constitution [lies in] Islamic teachings,” he continued.
“We are a country of democrats, so ours is a democratic Constitution and is the guarantee of our national solidarity and unity,” the PPP chairman added.
Zardari also termed the 1973 Constitution a gift to the people by the PPP founder, saying it was a document formed by consensus and carried the signatures of all the members of the National Assembly.
The former president said the importance of the 1973 Constitution could be gauged by how all the members in the NA with different political and religious affiliations had signed the document, agreeing to the document.
He paid tribute to all the politicians, who had signed the 1973 Constitution.

2,SC stands with Constitution: Justice Isa,Senior SC judge taking his seat among PM Shehbaz and Zardari surprises many,"Justice Qazi Faez Isa—the senior most judge of the apex court after the chief justice—has said he stands with the Constitution at a time when the federal government and the judiciary are at loggerheads and the schism between two groups of the Supreme Court judges is no longer a secret.
The presence of the senior puisne judge in the National Assembly’s hall at the golden jubilee of the 1973 Constitution triggered a controversy as some critics said the judge shouldn’t have attended the ceremony where he sat among the lawmakers whose cases he once heard in his courtroom.
Justice Isa, who walked to the Parliament House from the Supreme Court building, was the only top court judge to attend the National Constitution Convention (NCC).
It is learnt that National Assembly Speaker Raja Pervez Ashraf had invited all Supreme Court judges. However, no one opted to attend the event except Justice Isa.
As he went back to the Supreme Court from the Parliament House after making a speech, several people, including YouTubers, intercepted the judge and asked him various questions but he remained silent, conveying that he had said whatever he wanted to say at the assembly hall.
It surprised many when Justice Isa sat in the front row on the treasury benches along with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, former president Asif Ali Zardari and Finance Minister Ishaq Dar.
Though members of the legal fraternity considered Justice Isa’s presence in the parliament as a historical development, they said the senior puisne judge should have avoided attending the convention in view of the current polarization arising out of the Punjab polls’ case.
Despite the government’s reservations, incumbent Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial had recently ordered elections in Punjab. Subsequently, the National Assembly had passed a resolution against the SC verdict while the government had asked the top judge to step down.
Former Sindh High Court Bar Association president Salahuddin Ahmed, who was a member of Justice Isa’s legal team once, said Justice Isa should not have attended the convention at a time of political turmoil. “Perceptions matter. Even if he went there, he should have sat separately,” he added.
However, he said, those calling it a misconduct or unprecedented are uninformed. Even former chief justice Awnar Zaheer Jamali had addressed the Senate during his tenure. Interestingly, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) did not give an official response to Justice Isa participation in the event.
Read Judiciary, executive trying to cool frayed tempers
However, pro-PTI lawyers and media persons criticized Justice Isa for sitting with the lawmakers who got relief from his court in the past. For instance, Ishaq Dar, who was sitting on his left side, is a beneficiary of his ruling in the Hudabiya Paper Mills reference case. Also, Zardari, who was sitting on the right side, was exonerated by the Memogate Commission led by Justice Isa.
The commission, whose report was authored by Justice Isa, had conceded in its final report, presented before a larger bench of the Supreme Court that “no evidence was produced before us that would indicate that President Asif Ali Zardari had either authorised the preparation of the memorandum or directed that it be sent to the American administration…”
Justice Isa started his speech by saying that he came to the parliament to convey that he along with his institution stands with the Constitution. In his speech, Justice Isa said the judiciary, the parliament and the executive’s purpose is one and that is to serve the people.
 In his non-political speech, Justice Isa said the Supreme Court’s job is to swiftly decide cases as per the law and the Constitution; the parliament’s job is to enact legislation which is better for the people; and the executive and the government’s job is to implement the laws and the policies for the betterment of the people.
Addressing the speaker, Justice Isa said he had asked him before coming to the parliament if the speeches and discussion would only be limited to the Constitution and they would not wade into politics, saying that wasn’t the case.
“A lot of political speeches have been made,” Justice Isa said, smiling. “It’s their [politicians'] right guaranteed by the Constitution; I don’t say anything to them but it doesn’t mean that I agree with them.”
Justice Isa said he wanted to clarify things as cases involving lawmakers might come up before him; decisions might come against them and they might speak against him in the same assembly hall. “I came here because it was the Constitution's golden jubilee today; its celebration day,” he said.

During his speech, Justice Isa recalled that his father was the only member from Balochistan in Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s 19-member central working committee of the All India Muslim League, saying his father had established the Muslim League in Balochistan.
At one point, Justice Isa said the Englishmen, who ruled the subcontinent, could have provided better administration but we wanted to move ahead by learning from our mistakes.
Justice Isa also spoke about division in the judicial corridors since independence.
He said he didn’t like the use of the word minority as those referred to as minority, are equal citizens and have contributed in the making of the country and afterwards.
 “We [judges] write judgments and do not give speeches,” Justice Isa said.
In his speech, he also discussed the impact of the dissolution of the constituent assembly by Governor General Ghulam Muhammad in 1954.
Justice Isa also fondly remembered a former jurist of Parsi descent, Justice Dorab Patel, saying Justice Patel had refused to take oath of allegiance when former military ruler Gen Ziaul Haq issued a Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO).
Lauding Justice Patel’s stance, Justice Isa questioned: “If we had stood by Maulvi Tamizuddin at the time when the courts had stood by him — and rejected Ghulam Mohammad’s decree — do you think we would have seen the divide we see today?”
""The Constitution is 50-year-old now; we should keep it close to our heart now,” Justice Isa said. ""The Constitution should be cherished because it guarantees peoples’ rights, which is the most important thing.""
Endorsing a resolution calling for teaching the Constitution in schools, Justice Isa said it is essential for the people to understand the kind of power the Constitution gives them.
He said his wife used to teach at an American school and she told him that the school taught the children about the Constitution, right to vote, among other things, from an early stage.
He said Pakistan’s Constitution guarantees several rights that were not part of several other countries’ constitutions. He gave an example of giving right to information under Article 19-A of the Constitution.
Justice Isa said anybody could criticize him if he fails to defend the Constitution. Before concluding his roughly 15-minute speech, Justice Isa said he as well as the politicians have taken an oath to protect the Constitution.
He reiterated that he has nothing to do with the political speeches made before his speech. “It may be possible that tomorrow your case is presented before me. Do not then say that I ruled against you despite being invited here today,” he quipped.
He appreciated Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for declaring April 10 as the Constitution Day. The Constitution was passed by the National Assembly on April 10, 1973, authenticated by the president on the same date and was promulgated on August 14, 1973.

3,Imran demands probe into SHO’s ‘sudden’ death,PTI chief says Shehzad was critical witness in unearthing conspirators behind Wazirabad assassination plot,"Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan has demanded a “proper investigation” into the “sudden”  death of SHO Amir Shehzad Bhadar – the complainant of the FIR registered against the Wazirabad assassination attempt on the former premier in November last year.
According to the officer’s family members, Shahzad was at his native village Bhadar near Kharian Town of Gujrat when his condition deteriorated. He was driven to the Kharian Combined Military Hospital where doctors pronounced him dead on arrival, they added.
In a tweet on Monday, Imran said: “We demand a proper inquiry into the sudden death of SHO Amir Shehzad, of a heart attack. He had registered the FIR of Wazirabad assassination attempt on me and was a critical witness in unearthing the conspirators behind this assassination plot being inquired into by the JIT (joint investigation team).”
We demand a proper inquiry into the sudden death of SHO Amir Shehzad, of a heart attack. He had registered the FIR of Wazirabad assassination attempt on me & was a critical witness in unearthing the conspirators behind this assassination plot being inquired into by the JIT.
The former prime minister wrote, “The JIT record has also been tampered with. It is equally important to recall the mysterious circumstances surrounding the death of FIA investigator Dr Rizwan as well as the deaths of Maqsood Chaprasi and all other witnesses in Shahbaz Sharif's money laundering case.”

Meanwhile, criticising the incumbent rulers, Imran underscored that they came to power just to close their corruption case.
Nearly 60% of the federal cabinet was on bails when they were imposed in the country.

They had given themselves a clean chit in the corruption cases of over Rs1,100 billion by amending the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) law and appointing their own persons at the anti-graft body, while the PTI government recovered looted money of Rs480 billion during its tenure, he highlighted.
Imran
said the imported government had ruined all state institutions. The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and the police were being used to register fake cases and torturing the PTI leaders and workers.
The sanctions which were imposed on the PTI during the current regime had no example in the democratic history of the country.
The police and the law enforcement agencies had trampled the sanctity of “chadar and chardewari” by trespassing into the houses of the PTI leaders and workers, he said, adding that an attempt was made on his life while hundreds of his party workers had been arrested.
He said his party leaders and workers, including Azam Swati, Shahbaz Gill and others, journalists as well as social media activists had undergone custodial torture.
“A conspiracy was hatched to assassinate me in Murtaza Bhutto-style murder in the court compound in Islamabad. My chief of Staff, Shibli Faraz, was tortured in the Islamabad court compound. The main objective of the incumbent rulers was to weaken the state institutions to protect their looted wealth. Instead of focusing on the national economy, the government had all its focus on tightening the noose around its opponents by registering fake cases.”
On the Toshakhana (gifts’ repository) case, the PTI chief said the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had made a false case against him which would conclude soon.
“However, they hit an axe on their own foot by making a fake Toshakhana case against me. Now, both Nawaz Sharif and Zardari will face music when the PTI will unveil their thefts in Toshakhana. Both had illegally acquired expensive cars from the gift repository,” he pointed out.
Imran said the imported rulers had also compromised the role of the opposition by appointing Raja Riaz as the opposition leader in the National Assembly.
Further, Imran continued interviewing candidates to award party tickets for the upcoming Punjab Assembly elections. He also addressed party workers before Iftar at his Zaman Park residence.
