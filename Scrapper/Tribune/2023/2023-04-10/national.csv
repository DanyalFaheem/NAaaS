0,Is banking system at risk?,Govt’s borrowing from banks has increased significantly in recent years,"International markets have been shaken by the recent bank failures in the United States, Switzerland, and Lebanon. The economic situation in Pakistan is also uncertain, which raises concerns about the stability of its banking system.
However, the answer to whether we should be worried about our banking system is not a straightforward one – it’s both yes and no.
To start with, it is important to acknowledge that there are certain structural problems with Pakistani banks that have played a part in the difficulties experienced by the banking industry.
One of the structural issues with Pakistani banks is their high concentration risk. This is due to the fact that a few large banks hold a significant percentage of assets in the banking system.
This poses a concentration risk as the failure of one or more of these banks could have a severe impact on the entire financial system.
The second structural issue is the high rate of non-performing loans (NPLs). This is a significant problem as it means that a large proportion of loans given out by banks are not being repaid, resulting in a liquidity crisis in the banking sector. Furthermore, many of these NPLs are questionable and may appear to have been used to benefit certain individuals through collusion.
It is imperative to increase transparency in the banking system by making financial reports more accessible to the public and by encouraging whistle-blowers to come forward with information about corruption and fraud, particularly in relation to loan write-offs.
The third challenge is the lack of transparency and accountability in the banking system, which has resulted in widespread corruption, money laundering, and fraudulent activities. This has led to a loss of public trust in the banking sector and contributed to the lack of confidence from both domestic and foreign investors.
As for the fourth challenge, the legal and regulatory frameworks governing the banking system are inadequate, and enforcement is often weak, despite recent efforts to improve through the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)-oriented reforms. Fifth, Pakistan’s banking system suffers from a limited level of financial inclusion. A significant portion of the country’s population remains unbanked or underbanked, with limited access to formal financial services.
This has resulted in a lower level of financial literacy and restricted availability of credit to smaller businesses, which contribute significantly to the country’s economic activity. As a result, the full potential of deposits remains unutilised, leading to a scarcity of funds available for lending to businesses and individuals, ultimately hampering economic growth and job creation.
To build a strong and stable banking system, it is essential to tackle these underlying challenges. This requires implementing policies and reforms aimed at establishing a transparent, accountable, and competitive financial sector.
This may include increasing the independence and bolstering regulatory authorities, improving financial inclusion, and establishing appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks. Shifting the focus to why the Pakistani baking sector is not at risk, the primary reason is its relatively secure lending portfolio, which mainly consists of public debt and high-yield consumer lending.
The government is one of the biggest borrowers from the banking system. It obtains funds by issuing Treasury Bills, Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs), and other short and long-term instruments, which are utilised to finance budget deficits and other government expenses.
The State Bank of Pakistan’s most recent data as of February 2023 shows that the government borrowed Rs21.74 trillion out of the total credits or loans.
Meanwhile, public sector enterprises that are not part of the government borrowed Rs11.24 trillion, and the private sector borrowed a comparatively smaller amount of Rs8.6 trillion. Within the private sector loans, personal loans accounted for Rs1.2 trillion.
Looking at this credit portfolio from an economic policy perspective, it could be considered highly inefficient. However, from a banking perspective, it is quite secure since the risk of default by the state is much lower than that of the private sector. It’s worth noting that the government’s borrowing from the banking system has increased significantly in recent years. This is mainly due to higher budget deficits and increased expenditures, such as Covid-19 relief measures.
While borrowing can help finance vital public services and infrastructure, excessive borrowing may lead to higher inflation, put upward pressure on interest rates, and cause macroeconomic instability. Hence, it’s crucial for the government to manage its borrowing carefully and maintain fiscal discipline to ensure macroeconomic stability.
In recent years, there hasn’t been any significant bank failure in Pakistan, with the exception of one odd case attributed to mismanagement. This can be attributed to the secure lending portfolio mentioned earlier, along with a high lending-deposit spread and relatively lax regulatory oversight that has allowed some banks to cross certain red lines. However, this does not necessarily guarantee that all is good.
The concentration and composition of the lending portfolio, along with structural issues, an economic slowdown, and external shocks, are all cause for concern. It’s important to remain alert and cautious. Banking and financial meltdowns spread quicker than fire.

1,"Understanding bank run, consequences for economy","It sparks industry-wide panic that can lead to financial crisis, deepen recession","As the world tries to limp onwards from the Covid-induced supply chain challenges, economies are going into overdrive and heating up to a recession.
We are still grabbling to understand the cool-down impact on the economy of quantitative tightening, and waiting to witness any positive outcome of inducing recession via higher interest rates.
The zillion-dollar question that remains to be answered is whether the crisis has deepened, how far are we from the bottom and how long would the crisis linger on. The banking industry is bursting at the seams, as banks in the US, Switzerland, Germany, and South Africa have started to collapse. On the face of it, this looks counter-intuitive.
Textbook finance teaches us that as rates rise, banks tend to make higher spread as their NII (net interest income) rises. This is attributed to the fact that banks have more room to play with and charge a larger spread between the borrowing and lending rates. While this is true, there exists a difference in the sensitivity of assets and liabilities. Sensitivity is termed as the speed with which the rates on assets (loans made by a bank) and liabilities (deposits taken by the bank) align to the current market rates.
Generally, liabilities (deposits) have a higher sensitivity to interest rates while assets (loans) are repriced with a lag. Resultantly, in the immediate period of rate adjustments, interest spreads for the bank would be lower but as the market settles down the bank’s assets would be repriced and consequently, the spread would increase above the pre-rate rise times.
What we see currently happening in the banking industry can be termed a bank run. Simply stated, when a large number of depositors try to withdraw their money from a bank simultaneously, either as cash or as a transfer to other banks, the institution becomes unable to meet the demand for withdrawals and potentially becomes insolvent.
The banking system currently operates on what is referred to as the “fractional reserve banking system” under which institutions retain a small portion of their customer’s deposits in cash and liquid assets while the remaining amount is held in productive assets such as government bonds, corporate loans, mortgage-backed security, etc. Bank runs can have serious consequences for the affected bank, its customers, and the wider economy as a whole.
An uncontrolled bank run can wipe out shareholders, bondholders, and depositors (beyond the insured amount). As multiple banks get involved, it sparks a cascading industry-wide panic that can lead to a financial crisis and deepen the current economic recession.
There are several factors that can trigger a bank run such as a sudden loss of confidence in the bank’s ability to repay its obligations or rumours spreading about the bank’s financial health.
Issues that can cause ripples in the industry are potential or actual insolvency, the discovery of fraudulent activity, or as in the current situation concerns about capital adequacy due to huge mark-to-market losses in the bond portfolio. In some cases, the general unease about the economy can cause people to withdraw their money from banks and shift to other hard assets or cash, even if there is no evidence to suggest that their particular bank is in trouble.
The issue is that bank runs are a self-fulfilling prophecy, as the withdrawals of large sums of money by depositors would cause even a sufficiently strong bank to temporarily run out of cash and eventually collapse.
Bank runs have been a common occurrence throughout history, and have been known to lead to financial crises. Most famous example of a bank run was the Great Depression of the 1930s when millions of Americans lost their savings due to bank failures.
In 2008, the failure of Lehman Brothers triggered a series of bank runs and financial crises around the world and highlighted the need for better regulation and oversight of the banking industry, and saw the implementation of a series of new rules and regulations aimed at preventing future crises.
Not to mention just a few days back, comments from a senior representative of a group, holding minority shares in Credit Suisse, resulted in its share value going into a tailspin and culminating in its merger into UBS.
Proactive management from banks and regulators is required to ensure that the financial system remains stable and robust enough to absorb such shocks.
Insuring deposits, especially for small depositors, would create a sense of security such that they are less likely to withdraw funds in panic. Central banks can provide liquidity support to banks that are experiencing a liquidity crunch, by lending money to them or buying their assets, thus averting a potential crisis. Nevertheless, bank runs are bound to happen, and monitoring the health of financial institutions, improving risk management practices, and transparent communication by banks and regulators would be pivotal to maintaining a sense of calm during times of stress.

2,"Client, their prosperity big motivators for microfinance bank","Khushhali Bank looks forward to continuing to positively impact clients’ lives, their communities","Realising the growing need to cater to financing requirements of underserved individuals and small businesses at micro levels, the first microfinance bank was established in Pakistan in 2000 and since then it has improved the lives of hundreds of thousands of people nationwide.
Khushhali Microfinance Bank Limited (KMBL) President and CEO Aameer Karachiwalla, in an interview, told The Express Tribune that microfinance banks in Pakistan are primarily focused on providing financial services to individuals and small businesses.
They “cater to people with low-income levels, who do not have access to traditional banking services within agriculture, livestock and micro and small enterprises’ sectors with special focus on women entrepreneurs and low-income households.”
He emphasised that partnerships are crucial in this regard, especially during tough times. They are building partnerships with local NGOs, government agencies, and investors to access new markets, funding sources, and technical assistance.
“These partnerships have enabled us to serve the underserved communities and expand our operations,” he said.
The CEO elaborated that microfinance banks require a more personalised and community-oriented approach, which involves building relationships with customers, understanding their unique needs and circumstances, and offering customised financial solutions to meet those needs.
Additionally, microfinance institutions like KMBL “typically operate on smaller scales, with lower transaction volumes and smaller loan sizes, which require a different cost structure and risk management strategy.”
KMBL was the first microfinance bank established in Pakistan in 2000. It is managing one of the largest client bases amongst microfinance banks, with well over 700,000 active borrowers and over 3.1 million active savers.
“Our clients and their prosperity are the biggest motivators for Khushhali Bank, and we look forward to continuing to positively impact their lives and their communities.”
UBL is a founding shareholder and investor in Khushhali Microfinance Bank. It increased the shareholding to 30% in 2012, while the remaining 70% stake rests with foreign investors.
To provide financial services in remote and underdeveloped areas, the microfinance bank is using various channels such as its retail network, mobile banking, agent banking, and community-based approaches.
Providing financial services in such areas, however, pose unique challenges, including inadequate infrastructure, low levels of financial literacy, security concerns, and the lack of collaterals. “Inadequate infrastructure such as lack of roads, electricity, and internet connectivity makes it difficult for microfinance banks to provide services, and low levels of financial literacy among clients pose challenges of understanding financial products and services.
“Security concerns can also affect the operation of microfinance banks, and the lack of collateral can make it challenging for clients to access loans.”
Karachiwalla said that the Prime Minister’s Kissan Package, which provides interest-free loans to farmers who were hit by last year’s floods, is an initiative that KMBL is particularly proud of. This package is subsidised by the State Bank of Pakistan and has been well received by clients in the adversely affected farming community.
“We have also introduced robust salaries and pensions loan facility, where low-income households can borrow from us against deposits in their salary or pension accounts,” the CEO said.
“Additionally, in partnership with reputable insurance companies in Pakistan such as Adamjee, Jubilee, and Pak Qatar, we are offering insurance or bancassurance products. These solutions enable our clients to not only invest some of their savings but also receive life protection.” The Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent floods have had a significant impact on the microfinance industry, especially on the KMBL customer base that primarily operates in the agricultural and livestock business. “The two factors have certainly affected the profitability of our bank and the overall microfinance industry.”
Karachiwalla pointed out that lockdowns and slowdown in economic activity have caused delays in loan repayments from borrowers who were already struggling due to the pandemic. As a result, the bank had to defer payments for some borrowers, in line with the State Bank’s policy. “This gave them some relief in the short term, but it has also affected their repayment behaviour.”
Despite the challenges of 2022, “we’re confident in our ability to not only recover and grow, but achieve long-term sustainability,” he said. Financial services are critical to empowering individuals and small businesses who can contribute to the country’s economic growth.
“We are committed to promoting financial inclusion by reaching out to marginalised and underserved communities such as women, rural populations, and small businesses.
“To drive economic growth in Pakistan, we focus on supporting sectors such as agriculture, livestock, and micro and small enterprises. These sectors have the potential to create significant employment opportunities and contribute to the country’s sustainable economic growth.”
Sharing success stories, Karachiwalla said that KMBL has provided loan to a woman named Farzana to help her start a home-based embroidery business. With the loan, she was able to purchase a new embroidery machine and expand her business, which has now become a source of income for her family.
“Our focus on providing financial services to women has helped to promote gender equality and empower women economically.”

3,The power of compounding,A guide for beginners to initiate investments through Systematic Investment Plans,"Pakistan is a country with a young population as almost two-thirds of the population is under the age of 30. This young population has the potential to become a driving force in the country’s economic growth.
For young adults, starting early with investments such as SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) can be a wise decision. The earlier you start investing, the more time you have for your investments to grow and compound.
Starting early with small investments can help young investors build a diversified portfolio over time. The power of compounding can make a significant difference over the long term, and starting early gives investors a head start.
With the right approach and investment strategy, young investors can create a solid foundation for their financial future.
During times of high inflation, the cost of goods and services tends to rise, which reduces the purchasing power of money. This means that your money can buy less today than it could in the past.
Inflation can erode the value of your savings and impact your ability to meet future financial goals.
A majority of the investment cannot match the existing short-term inflation in Pakistan, however, by starting early and consistently investing, individuals can build a portfolio that can provide a cushion against inflation and help achieve their long-term financial goals.
SIP is a disciplined investment approach where an investor invests a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, typically monthly. To invest wisely, after setting financial goals, investors should determine their risk tolerance.
Know your risk-return profile
Different investment schemes carry varying risk levels, so it is essential to understand your risk appetite. Choosing a scheme that exceeds your tolerance may lead to portfolio losses.
For risk-averse investors, fixed interest rate schemes are an option, but they may not help reach goals in an extreme inflationary environment. A combination of fixed-income and equity-linked schemes are a better choice for those seeking capital appreciation and an aggressive approach to their portfolio.
However, if you have decided to invest in stock market, keep a long-term investment horizon: in hyperinflation, the stock market can be extremely volatile, and short-term market movements may not reflect the long-term potential of an investment.
Therefore, it is important to keep a long-term investment horizon when investing with an aggressive approach through SIP.
Patience pays off in long-term investing, so it is important to exercise patience when investing for the long term, rather than seeking quick returns.
Moreover, invest in mutual funds that offer multiple asset classes such as equity, debt, hybrid, ETFs and gold because it can provide diversification and help manage risk.
Here are some tips on how to use SIP in the current hyperinflation scenario:
Investing in inflation-resistant assets
In hyperinflation, the value of the currency decreases rapidly, which means that the value of investments in traditional assets such as stocks and bonds can also decrease rapidly.
It may be beneficial to invest in liquid and short-duration money market or in assets that are resistant to inflation, such as gold and real estate investment trusts (REITs).
In current scenario, Shariah-compliant money market funds are offering attractive returns of 16.75-17.25% while Shariah-compliant fixed term plans are offering a return 100 to 200 basis points (18.5-19%) above these money market mutual funds.
Power of compounding
Compound profit has a remarkable ability to increase wealth, especially when compounded frequently. To help readers understand the power of compounding in SIPs, let’s take a look at a hypothetical example.
Assuming the use of monthly cash funds for investment purposes, retirement age of 60 years and a historical 32-year weighted average policy rate of 11.5% (using a conservative approach, the assumed rate is much lower than the existing money market return of 17%), we can see how regular monthly investments can lead to substantial returns over time.
There are many SIP calculators online that will help you design a SIP for your desired maturity amount.
Mr A, a 35-year-old investor, has decided to invest Rs25,000 per month in a low-risk money market fund for a 25-year investment horizon. At maturity, his investment would grow to Rs43.41 million on a principal investment of Rs7.5 million.
Similarly, Mr B, a 25-year-old investor, has also invested the same amount on a monthly basis in a money market fund. However, he has a longer investment horizon of 35 years, which allows for more time for compounding to work its magic.
At maturity, his investment would grow to Rs142 million on a principal investment of Rs10.5 million.
In conclusion, we can see that Mr B’s investment has grown substantially more than Mr A’s due to the longer investment horizon and the power of compounding. This example illustrates the importance of starting to invest early and allowing time for investments to grow through the magic of compounding.
Monitor your investments
Even though SIP helps manage risk, it is important to monitor your investments regularly to ensure that your investments are performing as expected. If required, rebalance your portfolio or switch to a different investment option or asset class, if it is not performing well.
It is always recommended to consult with a financial adviser who can guide you in selecting the appropriate investment options based on your risk appetite, financial goals, and investment horizon. They can help you understand the risks and benefits of investing through SIP.
It’s also important to note that actual returns on investments can vary and depend on market conditions, fund performance, and investment strategy. However, the concept of compounding remains a powerful tool for achieving financial goals.

4,CPEC Authority: a game changer for Pakistan’s future?,"Merely making big statements, staging photo-ops will not suffice anymore","China is currently focused on revitalising the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which was expected following the relaxation of Covid-19 policies.
Since the recent two sessions, efforts to do so have been accelerated. It is anticipated that China will offer new opportunities for investment, with Chinese companies likely to invest in countries along the BRI. However, this new momentum of investment will be accompanied by a new philosophy of development, centred around the principles of high-quality development and green recovery.
China has made it clear that in order to achieve prosperity for both China and the world, development must adhere to the principles of ecological civilisation and sustainable development. It is crucial for Pakistan to contemplate the pace of implementation and status of projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
Pakistan must also explore how to adjust its policy framework to benefit from the new philosophy and principles of high-quality development. This is especially important for Pakistan, as the country is highly susceptible to the effects of climate change and requires a development model that is compatible with the climate.
Furthermore, China has identified Pakistan as a high-priority country and intends to give a boost to the CPEC initiative. During Ahsan Iqbal’s visit, the Chinese leadership expressed strong desire to increase investment under CPEC.
In order to capitalise on the new opportunities, Pakistan must refine its existing policy and implementation framework. Merely making big statements and staging photo-ops will not suffice. Pakistan must take concrete steps and introduce a series of reforms in order to fully benefit from the new opportunities. These steps should be innovative and forward-thinking, as they have the potential to help in economic recovery.
To achieve this goal, Pakistan must move beyond relying on the euphoria of its strategic location. While it is true that Pakistan occupies a strategic location, it alone will not help.
Furthermore, the notion of strategic location is relative and not absolute. For instance, if Pakistan wishes to access Central Asia, it must first pass through Afghanistan. In such a scenario, Afghanistan would be deemed to hold the strategic location.
Additionally, Pakistan must consolidate the progress made under CPEC. However, the current institutional framework and business environment are not conducive to fast-tracking implementation. In fact, they are likely to create hurdles.
Despite Pakistan’s improvement in the ease of doing business ranking, ground-level issues still persist. The business community has to deal with numerous organisations, institutes, and departments to pay taxes, obtain licences, or register a company.
For instance, there are 35 different tax agencies in Pakistan, resulting in wastage of time and resources. Moreover, the institutional system is inefficient and displays signs of rent-seeking.
In a nutshell, the process is cumbersome and discourages potential investors and industrialists from investing in Pakistan. In this backdrop, it is imperative for Pakistan to move beyond rhetoric and adopt measures that can give a fresh impetus to CPEC implementation.
One plausible solution could be to revive the CPEC Authority, which was an excellent initiative of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government. Although the CPEC Authority was primarily created as a monitoring body, it played a crucial role in facilitating stakeholders to implement CPEC projects.
Even during the pandemic, the CPEC Authority continued to function and deliver results, demonstrating the resilience and determination of Pakistan and China to keep CPEC moving forward.
However, the previous structure and setup of the CPEC Authority may not be adequate to meet the demands of the second phase of CPEC. The authority was previously responsible for overseeing and monitoring ongoing projects.
To fulfil the requirements of the second phase, a more robust and dynamic authority is required. Therefore, it is necessary to reform the authority, and the following suggestions are proposed for discussion and consideration:
Firstly, it is necessary to elevate the status of CPEC Authority. The head of CPEC Authority should hold the rank of a federal minister. Furthermore, the CPEC Authority should be granted the power to make and execute decisions in close collaboration with relevant ministries and departments.
Secondly, it is important to centralise services and work related to CPEC, particularly for industrialisation and agriculture, under the CPEC Authority.
Currently, these activities are scattered and time-consuming. Therefore, they should be consolidated under the CPEC Authority, which should also be authorised to issue licences, provide access to services such as electricity and gas, and manage taxation.
Thirdly, the CPEC Authority should have a diversified structure with two distinct departments: governance and research. The governance department would be responsible for programme execution, ensuring transparency and accountability. The research department would be tasked with devising innovative ways to attract investment, analysing international markets and global investment policies, and helping the government understand the philosophy of green BRI.
Fourthly, the CPEC Authority should be an apolitical body, immune to changes in government. As all political parties and stakeholders have consensus on CPEC, it should not be difficult to ensure that the authority remains apolitical. It is imperative that all political parties and stakeholders work together to ensure the authority’s continuity and stability.
Fifth, to ensure inclusiveness, the government could establish a National CPEC Committee (NCC), chaired by the prime minister of Pakistan.
The committee should include representatives from the five leading political parties, the leader of the opposition, the chief ministers of provinces, the prime minister of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, the services chiefs, and the Chief Justice of Pakistan.
This committee could help address challenges that have arisen since the 18th Amendment and provide vision and direction for strengthening cooperation. To ensure higher standards of work and transparency, a strong monitoring and accountability mechanism would be necessary. To achieve this, a sub-committee could be created by the NCC to oversee and enforce transparency and accountability measures.
This sub-committee would be the most suitable forum, as it has representation from all major stakeholders.
In conclusion, the CPEC Authority should be staffed with genuine economic experts and political economists with a background and understanding of China. These experts should have comprehensive knowledge of the Chinese model of economy and development, governance, community with a shared future, GSI, GDI, and ecological civilisation.
This is necessary because western experts do not fully understand China and try to compare apples to oranges.
