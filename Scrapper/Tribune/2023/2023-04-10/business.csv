1,Businessmen want barriers to Kabul trade dismantled,"Pakistan, Afghan traders propose ways to boost mutual business","A group of Pakistani and Afghan traders have expressed their concerns regarding the obstacles hindering the increase of bilateral trade between the two neighboring countries. In a meeting held at Torkham crossing, the participants engaged in a detailed discussion on the performance of various public sector institutions and the problems faced by the business community on both sides of the Pak-Afghan border.
The meeting was chaired by the recently appointed Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Collector Customs, Fayyaz Anwar.
Along with other senior officials, including representatives from customs, NLC, FC, police, and other security departments, the attendees suggested a number of proposals to solve the obstacles in the way of Pak-Afghan mutual trade. The meeting also discussed other pertinent issues.
Ziaul Haq Sarhadi, Coordinator and Director of PAJCCI, emphasized the need for steps to remove hindrances in the way of Pak-Afghan mutual trade and transit trade.
He explained that while there was no issue from the customs department at Torkham, Ghulam Khan, Kharlachi border, other institutions took a significant amount of time on checking. This slow processing has caused great difficulties for the business community, Sarhadi added.
Sarhadi further stated that despite official orders of cross-stuffing, the directives have not been implemented, and detention charges were also levied on each container.
The FCCA president suggested that Afghan transit trade goods should be carried out from Karachi to Torkham through Pakistan Railways along with a bonded carrier service. He urged the authorities concerned to allow filing of GD (Goods Documents) at Azakhel Dry Port, so that the customs clearing agents of K-P could also continue their business.

2,Policing failure: Unregistered bikes plying roads,Bike owners deliberately avoid getting number plates citing high registration costs,"Although not really known for actively enforcing traffic laws, the city of flowers’ police can now add another feather to its cap for failing to curb the relentless rise of unregistered motorbikes in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) capital.
Either due to a disregard for their duty or just sheer helplessness in trying to enforce the writ of the state, Peshawar’s traffic police has consistently failed to get unregistered motorbikes, which are often used in the commission of street crime and terrorism, off the city’s roads.
As per information obtained by The Express Tribune by the provincial Excise Department, Peshawar is home to more than 150,000 unregistered bikes. The Express Tribune also learnt that out of the 150,000 number, about 100,000 motorbikes’ registration has already been processed but their respective owners have failed to show up at the excise office to pick up the number plates for the past 6 months — which officials believe is a deliberate act.
Farooq Khan, who has been running a motorcycle dealership in Peshawar for the past decade, has no doubt that bike owners deliberately avoid getting number plates. “Whenever someone purchases a bike, we provide them with a company receipt and ask them to take it to the Excise Department for registration,” explained Khan, “however, they skip going to the excise office and instead drive around with impunity, using the company receipt as proof of ownership.”
Khan further said that motorcycle owners who claim that they do not get their bike registered because of the high costs are lying “because it only costs Rs 4,000 for the entire process.” However, it is perhaps unfair to put the blame entirely on motorcyclists as the traffic police does not care much for catching unregistered motorbikes, according to Khan. “They [traffic police] run a campaign against unregistered bikes once in a blue moon and then call it a day.”
This apparent disregard for enforcing traffic laws means that unregistered bikes can easily be used to commit crimes. Evidence of which is the cold-blooded murder of Muhammad Amir, a resident of the Chamkani area, who was shot by robbers riding an unregistered motorcycle and thus have not been identified yet.
In this regard, Riaz Khan, the Spokesperson for K-P Police, while talking to The Express Tribune, conceded that in Peshawar unregistered motorbikes are relied upon heavily by criminals involved in mobile phone snatching and robberies. “However, we have taken action against 32,913 unregistered motorcyclists in the past 13 months,” he hastened to add.
The Express Tribune also spoke to Peshawar’s SSP Traffic, Qamar Hayat, regarding the department’s failure to get unregistered motorbikes off the city’s roads, who informed that the sale of unregistered motorbikes has now been outlawed. “Now, motorcycle dealerships and dealers will make sure that the registration process is completed before they allow a bike to leave their shop,” said Hayat, adding that dealerships across the city had already agreed to such stringent measures. “If anyone is found aiding the sale of unregistered motorcycles, they will face harsh legal consequences,” cautioned Hayat while talking to The Express Tribune.

4,Cleric gunned down in Bajaur ambush,Police say vehicle of Maulana Naseeb waylaid while he was heading home; friend critically injured,"Yet another cleric has been gunned down in Bajaur tribal district of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P).
Police told The Express Tribune that in the Mamond area of Bajaur, unidentified miscreants opened fire. As a result, Maulana Naseeb Gul was killed on the spot while his friend Mufti Shafiullah critically injured.
“Both of them were on their way back home in a motorcar after shopping in the Lagharai Bazaar when unidentified men ambushed them,” a police official said, adding that the attackers managed to flee after committing the crime.
The injured was rushed to the Khar Hospital for treatment from where he was referred to the Lady Reading Hospital (LRH).
Police reached the site of the attack and cordoned off the entire area and conducted a door-to-door search operation. Local residents said that the slain cleric was a member of the Panjpiri group which is also known as Wahabi sect.
Attacks on clerics
Many Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) clerics and senior party members have been killed in Bajaur district in recent years.
In March 2021, JUI leader Maulana Abdul Salam was seriously injured in a remote-controlled bomb blast in the Dama Dola area of Mamund tehsil in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur tribal district.
Police officials told The Express Tribune that Maulana Salam was going to his madrassah early in the morning when he was hit by a roadside bomb. Police believed that a remote-controlled explosive device had been planted by the roadside and he was precisely the target.
He was later shifted to Peshawar for treatment where he succumbed to his injuries days later.
The attack was claimed by Islamic State-Khorasan.
In April 2022, Mufti Shafiullah, a JUI activist and an Arabic teacher at Government High School Badan, was targeted in a roadside bomb attack as he was on his way to school as per his daily routine.
“Mufti Shafiullah was going to school. As per his habit he walked to school and during his walk, an IED device exploded near him. He was seriously injured in the explosion and rushed to a hospital where he succumbed to his wounds,” the district police officer said.
“The deceased was an active member of Jamiat,” he said.
In November 2022, another ardent activist of JUI-F, Qari Ilyas, was shot dead in the tribal district and for the first time in the history of the tribal district, women staged a sit-in against the brutal murder.
Widespread protests erupted against the murder which continued for two days. The women of the Qari Ilyas family, including his widow and mother, also participated in the sit-in. They blamed that Qari Ilays repeatedly demanded of the authorities that there were threats to his life but it was denied each time so the district administration was responsible for his death.
All the markets in Bajaur district also remained closed in protest.
Lawyers also didn’t attend the courts as a mark of solidarity with the strike.
