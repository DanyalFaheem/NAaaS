0,PM calls allies’ meeting amid govt-CJP face-off,Govt likely to persist with its full-court demand,"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday invited all the allied parties in the federal government for a meeting on April 1 (today) at the PM House to discuss the deepening judicial crisis compounding challenges for a government already faced by political and economic crises.
The government was likely to persist with its full-court demand even after Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial did not budge from his earlier stance, turning down the attorney general for Pakistan’s (AGP) request to form a full court to hear the matter of holding elections in Punjab within the constitutional limit of 90 days.
The prime minister, who would attend the meeting via Zoom from Lahore, called the huddle of allies at a time when the top court’s bench was being disbanded and reconstituted on a regular basis in connection with the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s (PTI) petition against the postponement of elections in Punjab.
A key Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) minister said that the government would deliberate on the current political situation, the upcoming elections in line with the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) decision and the SC proceedings, as well as the role of the CJP and the top court, saying the meeting had been called as the government believed in moving ahead with its allies’ consent.
The coalition government had allegedly been accusing the judiciary of “bench-fixing” in crucial cases, continuously giving “discriminatory” judgments and handing out one interpretation of the Constitution to PTI chief Imran Khan, and another to the ruling alliance.
The PML-N led federal government had been demanding the formation of a full court to decide the matter while some key leaders of the ruling party had openly criticised some senior judges, including the CJP, for their alleged impartiality.

Even PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif held a news conference in London on Friday to demand a full court to decide the matter of elections, saying that whatever the full court decided, would be acceptable to all. He wondered that when the incumbent three-member bench was not acceptable then how could its decision be accepted.
Recently, a five-member bench of the Supreme Court (SC) led by CJP Bandial was formed to hear the PTI’s petition against the ECP’s March 22 notification, announcing the postponement of elections in Punjab, earlier scheduled for April 30, 2023.
However, the federal government and the CJP came face to face after the government passed a bill – The Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Bill, 2023 – from the National Assembly (NA) and the Senate clipping CJP Bandial’s powers to initiate suo motu proceedings and to constitute benches on his own, proposing that a three-member committee should decide such matters.
Soon after the bills sailed through from both houses, an SC bench held that all cases that various benches were hearing under Article 184 (3) of the Constitution be postponed until amendments were made in the Supreme Court Rules 1980 regarding the discretionary powers of the CJP.
The three-judge led by Justice Qazi Faez Isa and comprising Justice Aminuddin Khan and Justice Shahid Waheed issued the verdict with a vote of two to one with the dissenting note by Justice Waheed.
Next, the CJP through the SC registrar issued a circular and “disregarded” the judgment issued by Justice Isa and Justice Aminuddin, in which they had called for the postponement of suo motu matters until amendments were made to the SC Rules 1980 regarding the country’s top judge’s discretionary powers to form benches.

The government had been calling the CJP to put his house in order, arguing that the nine-member bench had come down to three and it was time that the CJP constituted a full court so that collective wisdom of the top court decided the election matter once and for all.
The CJP, however, so far refused to constitute a full court and was all set to take up the matter on coming Monday. CJP Bandial said that neither law nor rules talked about the composition of a full court and the court would not “go back” to the start as the matter was being heard for days now.
On the one hand, PM Shehbaz had called a meeting while, on the other, Justice Bandial said in the courtroom on Friday that he would conduct some meetings after the hearing, hoping: “Monday’s sun would rise with good news.”

1,Govt threatens SC judges with references,Sana says they respect bench members but have reservations about their verdicts," 
The country’s top security czar has said the incumbent coalition government may file references against the three Supreme Court judges including Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial who are hearing a plea against postponement of polls in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P).
“The possibility of filing references against the judges cannot be ruled out,” said Federal Minister for Interior Rana Sanaullah on Saturday while talking to Express News’ anchor Rehman Azhar.
“We respect the three judges [who are part of the bench] in their individual capacity but have serious reservations about their verdicts. We may file references [against them],” Sanaullah added.
CJP Umar Ata Bandial is leading the bench that is hearing the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s (PTI) plea against the Election Commission of Pakistan’s March 22 notification, announcing postponement of elections in Punjab, earlier scheduled for April 30.
Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Munib Akhtar are also part of the bench.
The bench, originally comprising 5 members, was reduced to a three-judge bench after two members of the bench – Justice Aminuddin Khan and Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail--recused themselves from hearing the case respectively on March 30 and March 31.
The CJP, however, rejected the coalition government’s plea to form a full bench to hear the plea, prompting a strong reaction from ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supreme leader Nawaz Sharif, who on Friday said his party would not accept the decision of the existing bench.
The parties of the ruling coalition on Saturday held a conference in which they reiterated their demand to form a full bench, warning that they would not accept the decision of the incumbent bench.
Talking with reference to the coalition parties’ conference, Sanaullah said heads of all coalition parties including Pakistan Peoples Party Co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari attended the meeting--the latter via video link--and agreed that proceeding of the case by the three judge bench was illegal and unconstitutional.
“There is a complete agreement among the coalition parties and not a single person raised any objection. The entire leadership of the PPP is on board with the PML-N. We are not going to become part of the proceedings.”
The interior minister claimed that the case at hand did not invite suo motu jurisdictions. “We will request the court to quash the proceedings as the matter has been resolved [by an earlier SC bench] by a vote of 4 to 3.”
Sanaullah was referring to the 9-judge bench that CJP Bandial formed in February to hear the petitions filed under Article 184 (3) of the Constitution against delay in announcement of polls in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) provinces.
Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi had recused themselves when the ruling party raised questions about their integrity while Justice Yahya Afridi and Justice Athar Minallah had disassociated themselves from the proceedings after questioning maintainability of the petitions.
Later on March 1, a five-judge larger bench by a vote of 3 to 2 ruled that the president and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) should announce polls in Punjab after mutual consultation.
The federal government had, however, claimed that the PTI’s election delay petition was actually rejected by a vote of 4-3, a view also shared  by some SC judges.

2,Social media platforms to be asked to ‘register’ in Pakistan,"Ministers’ absence irks both govt, opposition senators","The absence of ministers from the Senate sessions has become so consistent that the treasury senators, along with those belonging to the opposition, on Friday demanded that the chairman should take notice of this matter.
Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani, who was presiding over the proceedings of the upper house of parliament, assured the lawmakers that he would take up this issue with the prime minister.
During Question Hour, PPP Senator Rubina Khalid said that the government appeared to be helpless on the issue of blasphemous and derogatory content on the internet.
She added that the matter had been taken up several times during the meetings of the Senate Standing Committee on Information Technology and it was the responsibility of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to take action against such content.
Minister of State for Law and Justice Shahadat Awan replied that online hate speech against any religion would be blocked immediately.
Elaborating further, Awan maintained that around 35,000 pages on Facebook and over 5,000 Twitter handles had been blocked.
He added that 5,800 accounts on YouTube had been blocked as well.
He further informed the House that the incumbent government was working on legislation to compel the social media platforms to register themselves in Pakistan.
He added that the prime minister had formed a National Social Working Committee in August last year to suggest proper legislation for this purpose.
Awan told the House that the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) had processed 59,253 URLs related to sectarian or hate speech complaints on social media so far.
Of the total complaints, 47,674 URLs had been blocked over hate speech till February, he added.
The state minister pointed out that the PTA had also blocked Wikipedia  on the directives of the high court for 48 hours.
Awan explained that under Section 37 (1) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) 2016, the PTA had been empowered to remove or block access to information through any  system if it considered it necessary in the interest of the integrity, security or defence of Pakistan.
He continued that under Section 37 (2) of Peca, the federal government had approved the Removal and Blocking of Unlawful Online Content (Procedure, Oversight and Safeguard), Rules, 2021.
PML-N Senator Dr Asif Kimani drew the attention of the chairman to the empty front row, regretting that the absence of ministers indicated their lack of interest in Senate proceedings.
Awan told him that a few ministers were busy and were unable to attend the Senate session.
An enraged Kirmani asked him that the senators had no other business to attend to that they were participating in the proceedings.
The Petroleum Act 1934 Amendment Bill 2022 and Trade Disputes Resolution Bill 2023 were presented in the House.
Both the bills were sent to their respective standing committees.
Climate Change Minister Sherry Rehman informed the Senate that  electrical vehicles were very expensive and any ordinary person could not import them.
She noted that India's Tata company was locally manufacturing electrical vehicles.
However, she added that unfortunately in Pakistan, there existed no such facility to manufacture electrical vehicles or  batteries.
She informed the House that in Pakistan, a policy for electrical two and three-wheelers had been framed.
The minister said around 3.3 million tons of plastic waste was generated in Pakistan but its recycling facility was available in a few European countries only.
To another question, she said the prime minister had launched the “Protected Areas Initiative” to improve flora and fauna of 15 places extending over 7,500 square kilometres.
The Senate session was adjourned till 11am on Monday.
After the conclusion of the sitting, Sanjrani called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to inform him about the absence of ministers from the Senate proceedings and ensure their presence.

3,"Rice crop in surplus despite floods, NA told",Parliamentary secretary says production stands at 5.4MMT against 3.8MMT consumption,"Parliamentary Secretary for National Food Security and Research Ahmad Raza Maneka on Friday said the rice crop production was in surplus despite flood devastation.
Responding to a query of Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) MNA, Ghous Bux Khan Maher during the Question Hour of the 51st session of the National Assembly, he said the wheat stocks were properly stored and preserved from damages during the 2022 floods.
However, the rice production was 5.4 million metric tonnes (MMT) against the local consumption of 3.8MMT last year, he added.
Maher posed the question that what measures the government had taken to enhance rice crop yield as the production had declined to one-third?
MNA Wajiha Qamar of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) also queried that what measures were being taken to ensure climate-resistant crops adaptable to shifting weather patterns amid prevailing growing environmental degradation and climate change?
Maneka responded that innovative methods of farming, hybrid seeds and farmers' training could only ensure increase in crop yield. He said the latest methods and techniques of crop cultivation were the only remedy that was being imparted to the farmers.
MNA Salahuddin demanded of the housing ministry to provide details related to plots allotted to 16 employees of Grade-16 and above of the ministry. He added that the ministry should also clarify that either any of these officials were awarded more than one plot.
Parliamentary Secretary for Housing and Works Syed Mehmood Shah said the 16 employees of the ministry were not yet allotted plots but rather it was announced, whereas none of them availed dual plots in this case and the possession of these plots would be given after June.

4,PBC demands full court to hear all political cases,Legal fraternity offers to mediate between opposing political parties," 
Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) Vice Chairman Haroonur Rashid and Executive Committee Chairman Hassan Raza Pasha have expressed their concerns over the current situation, saying that differences among the judiciary are not good for the Supreme Court (SC).
They desired that a full court meeting of the SC be called, and all internal issues should be resolved in that meeting.
They said that the PBC had time and again requested that in all political issues and cases, a full court should be constituted to avoid any criticism of the top court and its judges, and that would also uphold the image of the top judiciary in public.
They reiterated their earlier stance that in the present situation, the PBC was ready to call/arrange an all-party conference (APC) to reconcile differences/disputes, including the election issue, through dialogue.
They requested all the political parties to step down to create harmony and consensus on all the issues and to reduce the hype going on for the sake of the country and the public because Pakistan could not afford to further linger on the prevailing tensions among political parties.

6,15% of GDP be allocated for water: minister,"New wave of Covid-19 not alarming, NA told","Federal Minister for Water Resources Khursheed Shah has proposed that the government allocate an amount equivalent to 15% of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the annual budget for developing water resources in the country.
 “We have a huge population. We need to allocate more funds for developing water resources,” Shah said on Friday on the floor of the lower house. He was responding to a point of order with regard to the Indian demand to renegotiate the 1960’s Indus Waters Treaty (IWT).
Shah told the house that the government immediately responded to the Indian notice with regard to the IWT, a water-distribution treaty between India and Pakistan, arranged and negotiated by the World Bank, to use the water available in the Indus River and its tributaries.
“We have a meeting in this regard today. What we need to do is to allocate more funds for developing water resources. I suggest that the house also pass a resolution in this regard,” the minister added.
National Assembly Speaker Raja Pervez Ashraf expressed displeasure over absence of grade-20 officers of various ministries in the house during the question hour. He referred the matter to the privilege committee while noting that strict action be taken against these officers.
Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Murtaza Javed Abbassi raised the matter regarding the absence of senior officers of relevant ministries.
He said only one senior officer was present during the proceedings while officers of almost eight other ministries were absent. He said the speaker had earlier directed all ministries to ensure the presence of their senior officials during the question hour and the prime minister had also ordered the same.
Despite these instructions, he said, senior officers did not bother to come to the house.
Taking notice of the issue, Speaker Ashraf referred the matter to the privilege committee while noting that the National Assembly Secretariat would also initiate action against the officers.
Parliamentary Secretary Dr Shazia Soomro told the house that the new wave of coronavirus was not deadly and that the situation was under control. “The government is planning to vaccinate schoolchildren against the virus,” he said.

7,SC disregards 2-judge verdict deferring suo motu cases,Registrar says Justice Isa-led bench violated rules laid down by majority judgement,"The Supreme Court (SC) on Friday “disregarded” a judgment authored by Justice Qazi Faez Isa ordering the postponement of suo motu cases till amendments were made in the SC Rules 1980 regarding the discretionary powers of the chief justice to form benches.
In its circular, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial noted that the observations made by the majority judgment in paras 11 to 22 and 26 to 28 were beyond the matter fixed before the court and “invokes its suo motu jurisdiction”.
Interestingly, the apex court issued the circular hours before a four-member bench was to start hearing the Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) elections’ delay case.
The circular noted that the “unilateral assumption of judicial power” in such a manner violated the rule laid down by a five-member judgment.
“Such power is to be invoked by the Chief Justice on the recommendation of an Honourable Judge or a learned Bench of the Court on the basis of criteria laid down in Article 184(3) of the Constitution. The said majority judgment therefore disregards binding law laid down by a larger bench of the Court,” the circular read.
“Any observation made in the said judgment, inter alia, for the fixation or otherwise of cases is to be disregarded. Accordingly, a circular be issued by the Registrar stating the foregoing legal position for the information of all concerned,” the circular concluded.
What was the judgment?
On Wednesday, a special SC bench, with a two-to-one majority, ordered suspending all suo motu cases — under Article 184(3) of the Constitution — until amendments were made to the SC rules governing the chief justice's discretionary powers.
The special bench order came on the suo motu case related to examining the award of additional 20 marks to Hafiz-e-Quran candidates applying for enrolment to an MBBS/BDS degree. Justice Isa headed the bench comprising Justice Aminuddin Khan and Justice Shahid Waheed.
CJP Bandial had formed the three-member special bench to hear the case, but Justice Isa objected to the constitution of the bench.
Justice Waheed — who also wrote a dissenting note against the order — raised objections, saying: ""The points raised and discussed in the order were not subject to the case.""
The order, penned by Justice Isa, mentioned: ""The Supreme Court Rules, 1980 (the Rules) neither permit nor envisage special benches. However, a Special Bench comprising of three Judges was constituted to hear this case.""
The majority order said the top court comprises the CJP and all judges.
""The Constitution did not grant the Chief Justice unilateral and arbitrary power to decide the above matters. With respect, the Chief Justice cannot substitute his personal wisdom with that of the Constitution,"" the order stated.
Collective determination by the chief justice and the judges of the apex court could also not be assumed by an individual, albeit the chief justice, the order said.
The SC registrar said that the order violated the rules laid down by a five-member judgement.

8,‘March 30 order dictated in my absence’,Justice Miankhail says there is need to first resolve controversy surrounding SC’s March 1 order,"Citing reasons for his recusal from a bench that was hearing the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) plea against postponement of polls in Punjab, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail has said the order issued after Thursday’s hearing was dictated in his absence and without consulting him.
Justice Mainkhail on Friday recused himself from hearing the case, a day after the recusal of Justice Aminuddin Khan who was also a member of the five-judge bench formed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial to hear the PTI’s petition.
According to a two-page note issued by Justice Miankhail, he wanted to express his views when Justice Aminuddin decided to recuse himself from the case in view of the March 29 verdict of an SC bench which held that hearing of all suo motu cases be postponed till amendment is SC rules.
“However, the Hon’ble Chief Justice and other members of the bench rose, therefore, I was unable to do so. Subsequently, I remained in my chamber for a reasonable time, but received no information from the Hon’ble Chief Justice regarding further proceedings into the matter.
“When I reached home later the same day, I received an order dated 30.03.2023 from the Chief Justice for my signatures as a member of the bench,” he noted.
Reproducing the brief order which said that Justice Umar Ata Bandial, Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Munib Akhtar disagreed with the March 29 order of the SC bench, Justice Miankhail added that the order was dictated in his absence.
“Admittedly, the order was not dictated in open court, instead it was dictated in my absence and without contacting me for participation in the deliberations. I felt that the three learned members of the bench, for reasons best known to them, opted not to involve me in the consultation.”
He said the PTI’s petition was the outcome of the previous proceedings “which were dismissed by two honourable members of the bench –Justice Yahya Afridi and Justice Athar Minallah—through their respective short orders, followed by myself and Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah”.
“In this behalf, we issued our detailed reasons on 27.03.2023. Right from the first date of hearing of the present matter, I wanted this bench to resolve the controversy of the order dated 01.03.2023 and its Order of the Court, which has still not been issued till date, as it is of great significance to the present matter.
“No heed was paid to this issue, despite my raising it repeatedly. The learned Attorney-General, members of the legal fraternity, and learned counsel for the political parties also requested for resolution of this issue, but received no response from the other members of the bench.”
Justice Yahya Afridi on Friday also issued a 7-page detailed order citing reasons for dismissing three proceedings with regard to delay in announcement of polls in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“Firstly, the Intra-Court Appeals filed by the Governor of Punjab and the Election Commission of Pakistan against the judgment of the single bench [of the Lahore High Court] dated 10.02.2023 were pending before the Lahore High Court…“The Peshawar High Court was also hearing a Constitutional Petition seeking similar relief for appointment of the date of election to the Provincial Assembly of the K-P;
“Secondly, the judgments of the pending proceedings before both the high courts could be challenged before this court under its appellate jurisdiction envisaged under Article 185 of the Constitution,” he added.
