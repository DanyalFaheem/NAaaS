1,Bahawalnagar crops face destruction,Heavy rains and stormy winds sound alarm bells for farmers,"High quality of wheat has been sown on a million acres of land in Bahawalnagar district of South Punjab this year. The district keeps its standard intact, and it is on top of the list of the districts which completed their purchasing targets and providing wheat to the other districts.
Crops like mustard, canola, corn and others are also being sent to national and international markets. Rice and cotton from Bahawalnagar are also being supplied to the biggest trade centres of Asia. 
The farmers are restless today and have appealed to the government to bail them out since they borrowed money from the landowners to buy fertilizers and also bought petrol on credit. Moreover, they also had to pay to the bank. 
The farmers said they were also facing shortage of canal water and were being fleeced by a mafia who, they alleged, was selling fake chemicals for crops.
In current weather conditions, rains will be very damaging to the wheat crop. Heavy rains and stormy winds have sounded alarm bells for the farmers. 
The time for harvesting of crops has almost arrived, while the harvesting process has already started in the rain-fed Cholistan areas. The situation is very critical due to climate change. According to the Department of Agriculture, 12% of the losses have been reported. According to the farmers, 25% of additional wheat crops have faced heavy losses, but more rains would prove to be a disaster for the wheat crop. 
Agricultural experts say that more rains would cause record losses to the farmers.
The district has been hit by a thunderstorm since last night. There are apprehensions that 30% of the wheat crop would be destroyed due to rains, and further bad weather would prove to be fatal for the wheat crops.

2,Poachers make most of wildlife staff shortage,No step in sight to fill over 500 vacant posts in dept,"The provincial government's disinterest in filling more than 500 vacant posts in the wildlife department is reportedly severely affecting its functions related to maintaining the zoos and curbing illegal hunting.
According to sources in the department, the vacant posts include those of director, deputy directors, assistant directors and wild life inspectors. 
Due to shortage of the staff, problems in the government zoos and safari parks are increasing in addition to an alarming rise reported in illegal hunting in the province.
The sources told The Express Tribune that the post of the director of the Punjab Wildlife Department had been vacant for the past several months. 
Similarly, eight posts of deputy director, including that of the Lahore region are also vacant. 
Another 20 posts of assistant director of the department are vacant in different districts, including Lahore and Sheikhupura.
In addition, more than 100 posts of wildlife inspector have been vacant for a considerable period without any initiative for recruitment.
More than 400 vacant posts of wildlife watchers and many other positions are also awaiting recruitment.
The sources said the posts of the director and deputy directors who had retired during the past couple of years had not been filled so far.
Some officials in the department are fulfilling responsibilities on the basis of additional charge. 
An official told The Express Tribune that the department had forwarded a regarding the shortage of manpower to the Punjab secretary for forests and wildlife but the problem was yet o be solved.
He said the shortage of administrative officers and field staff had contributed to problems in reducing the incidents of illegal hunting of rare wild animals and birds.
The department was trying to curb illegal hunting with its available resources but the efforts were having a limited effect and the violation of laws was n the rise, the official said.
He added that some important decisions related to the department were also pending due to the absence of the director and deputy directors authorised in this regard.
The official said a former provincial secretary of forests and wildlife had decided to merge the staff of the wildlife and fisheries departments but there had been no progress in this regard.
The officials have informed that DG WildLife has immediately appointed Deputy Director Bahawalpur Tanveer Ahmad Jangooa as Lahore deputy director.
While speaking to Express Tribune, Tanveer Ahmed Jangooa stated that there has been a shortage of manpower in the department for a long time, which is why the existing officers and staff are being overburdened with work. He said that it is true that in some districts, funds are not being released and other issues are arising due to the vacancy of the Deputy Director's position.
Several steps had been taken in the past to check illegal hunting but none of them proved fruitful.
In February last year, the Punjab Wildlife Department had imposed a ban on the hunting of wild birds and water birds across the province.
The ban was to remain in force for eight months and cases registered against poachers for violating the ban.
The ban was imposed with the start of the breeding season of wild animals to increase the breeding of wild birds and water birds - for which a formal notification has also been issued by the government of Punjab.
