0,Oil ticks up as US inflation cools,On course for weakest performance since Nov 2022,"Oil prices nudged higher on Friday with US inflation data showing some signs of slowing price rises, but for the month, oil was on course for its weakest performance since November.
Brent futures, which have risen nearly 6% this week, were up 26 cents, or 0.3%, at $79.53 a barrel by 1456 GMT. The US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 37 cents, or 0.5%, to $74.74, having gained about 8% so far this week.
If those levels hold, oil prices will record their second straight week of gains, but Brent and WTI were also set for losses of about 5% and 3%, respectively.
The benchmarks hit their lowest since 2021 on March 20 in the wake of large bank failures. “The prolonged economic scarring of the last month will likely slow the economy, if not cause a recession, and lower interest rate expectations are not enough to support oil prices in the short term,” said Craig Erlam, senior markets analyst at Oanda.
Providing support to prices on Friday, the US Personal Consumption Expenditure index rose 0.3% in February on a monthly basis.

1,Honda Atlas extends shutdown,Says supply chain disruptions have forced company to extend shutdown until April 15,"Honda Atlas Cars Pakistan has extended its plant shutdown by 15 days, the longest to date, due to the ongoing economic crisis in Pakistan, which has made it difficult to open letters of credit (LCs) for imports and halt foreign payments.
The company had initially planned to end its shutdown on March 31 but due to supply chain disruptions caused by the country’s economic challenges, it has had to extend the shutdown until April 15. Other automakers, including Indus Motor Company Limited and Pak Suzuki Motor Company, have also been forced to halt production intermittently for the past three quarters due to economic difficulties.
According to the Finance Division Economic Adviser’s Wing Monthly report of March 2023, the performance of the auto-industry remained subdued due to massive increases in input prices, tightening auto finance, and import restrictions. During the July to February period of fiscal year 2023, car production and sales decreased by 43.14% and 47.5%, respectively, while trucks and buses production and sales decreased by 31.2% and 29.9%.
Auto sector analyst at JS Global, Wasil Zaman said, “Automakers are facing supply and demand-side issues resulting in low volumes due to limited forex reserves and administrative controls to curb imports. The local auto parts industry is also affected, with Agriauto Industries Ltd (AGIL) closing plants as demand for original equipment makers (OEMs) is staggered. Even if import controls are relaxed, automakers are expected to continue facing challenges such as high prices caused by the sharp devaluation of the rupee and higher interest rates.”
In response, automakers have already increased prices 3-4 times in 2023 by up to 29%. The industry is expected to suffer a cumulative volume decline of over 50% year-on-year in FY2023, extending into the first half of FY2024.
Auto expert Mashood Ali Khan suggested that cost-cutting measures, such as reducing manpower, overheads, and inventories, not purchasing heavy materials, and shutting down plants, must be implemented to stay afloat in the industry. The future plans in the industry are on hold, and unfortunately, many industries may collapse, so it’s essential to develop strategies together, lend support, and maintain the industry to avoid collapse.
Meanwhile, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has removed the condition of Cash Margin Restriction (CMR) on imported goods to improve the import conditions – a move welcomed by Korangi Association of Trade and Industry (KATI) President Faraz-ur-Rehman. He said that with this initiative, the shortage of raw material and essential items will be removed in the country. The government was losing revenue massively due to the ban, and the removal of the condition of CMR will restore the supply of scarce raw material and essential commodities in the country.
Speaking to the Express Tribune, president KATI said that the SBP should impose third-party payment for the import of luxury and non-essential goods and all import duties should be collected through bank accounts. He said that the government should provide more facilities by abolishing the duty on the import of machinery required for the IT sector and technology transfer.

2,Rupee stabilises around current levels,"Pakistani rupee inched down 0.05%, or Rs0.13, and closed at Rs283.79 against the US dollar","Pakistani rupee stabilised around current levels on Friday as it inched down 0.05%, or Rs0.13, and closed at Rs283.79 against the US dollar in inter-bank market.
The latest downtick came after the central bank reported that Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves had dropped by $354 million to $4.24 billion in the week ended March 24, 2023.
The reserves fell after consistent improvement for six consecutive weeks. Previously, the reserves rose partly as a result of increase in workers’ remittances, export earnings and debt inflows from China amid reduced import payments.
Market talk suggests that Friday’s drop in the rupee’s value was insignificant considering that the currency had continued to move around current levels for the past one month.
The currency registered a significant drop of 19%, or Rs54, in late January and early February 2023, reaching an all-time low of Rs285.09/$.

3,China rolls over $2b loan to Pakistan,Announcement comes as nation struggles with external liquidity,"Pakistani Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said on Friday that China had rolled over a $2 billion loan that matured last week, providing relief during the nation’s acute balance of payment crisis.
Locking in a rollover had been critical for Pakistan, where reserves have dipped to just four weeks’ worth of imports and talks over an International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout tranche of $1.1 billion have hit a stalemate.
“I am happy to confirm that this had been rolled over on March 23,” Dar told parliament, referring to the maturity date. He said all concerned documentation had been completed.
Neither the government in Beijing nor the Chinese central bank responded to requests for comment on the rollover.
Dar’s comments were the first official announcement of the rollover after the loan matured. However, the finance minister did not give the new maturity date or other terms of the arrangement.
A top finance ministry official told Reuters on Wednesday that a formal confirmation of the refinancing would be made after the process was completed.
One of the IMF’s conditions for the release of the next tranche is assurance of external financing to fund Pakistan’s balance of payments.
Long-time ally Beijing has provided the only help Islamabad has got so far, with refinancing of $1.8 billion credited last month to Pakistan’s central bank.
In its monthly Economic Update and Outlook, the Finance Division of the government noted that Pakistan was currently confronted with shortage in external liquidity.
Islamabad has been negotiating with the IMF since early February for the release of $1.1 billion from a $6.5 billion bailout package agreed in 2019. To unlock the funding, the government has cut back on subsidies, removed an artificial cap on the exchange rate, added taxes and raised fuel prices.
“Through demand management policies, the government is trying to limit the current account deficit, which will not transfer further pressure on dwindling reserves,” read the report.
It added that inflation, which is already running above 30%, a near 50-year high, is expected to stay elevated.
The report cited market frictions caused by relative demand and supply gaps of essential items, exchange rate depreciation, and the recent upward adjustment in prices of fuel as reasons behind higher inflation expectations.

4,New rules unveiled for sales tax on electricity,FBR will collect tax from DISCOs on actual amount received from consumers,"The federal government has recently met another condition of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the reduction of circular debt as it has introduced new rules for the collection and payment of tax on electricity.
According to a document available with The Express Tribune, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has issued Special Procedure Rules 2023, which outlines changes to the tax collection procedure.
Under the new rules, the FBR will collect sales tax from the electricity distribution companies (DISCOs) on the actual amount received from consumers instead of the amount accrued on electricity bills.
For this purpose, DISCOs will gradually link electricity meters across the country with the Computerised National Identity Card (CNIC) numbers of consumers instead of the reference number or meter number.
Subsequently, electricity bills will be issued to consumers on their CNIC number. In case of tenants, their computerised numbers will also be recorded on the electricity bills.
If a tenant defaults on bill payment, a bill will be issued on their identity card and the tenant will be considered as a defaulter.
DISCOs will submit details of delinquencies of electricity bills to the FBR on a monthly basis. The FBR and related institutions, including PTV, will then take action to recover the dues on their own from the defaulters.
After implementation of the rules, sales tax will be collected from the electricity distribution companies on the amount recovered from the consumers instead of the amount billed. The new rules are aimed at reducing the circular debt and revenue loss suffered by DISCOs.
According to a senior FBR officer, these amendments have been made on a condition of the IMF to reduce the circular debt. Previously, a large number of consumers of DISCOs did not pay their electricity bills, resulting in a double loss of revenue to DISCOs.

5,Further extension in SSGC board’s term likely,Tenure of directors has already been extended a couple of times,"The Petroleum Division is planning to seek another extension in the tenure of Sui Southern Gas Company’s (SSGC) board of directors.
The tenure of SSGC board expired on October 28, 2022. Though five months have passed, the ministry has failed to nominate new directors.
However, the ministry requested the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) for a three-month extension in the board’s term, which was granted as a one-time exception under the prevailing SECP rules.
The Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division) could not nominate new directors by January 26, 2023 and approached the SECP again for an extension of 90 days.
Although there was no provision for such an extension in the SECP rules, it was “illegally” granted after repeated requests by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources.
The second extension in the board’s tenure will expire on April 26, 2023. However, SSGC needs to publish the names of contesting/nominated directors by April 5 to comply with the SECP rules.
Sources said that the list of new directors had not been finalised yet and the Ministry of Petroleum was planning to seek yet another extension in the board’s term.
It may be noted that SSGC’s performance during the tenure of the current technically defunct board had been worse in terms of line losses, which stood at 18.5% as of February 2023. The state-owned gas utility also has a negative equity of Rs28 billion, turning it into a sick unit.
The company, which was once known as the best public utility in the region, is now unable to provide uninterrupted gas supply to its consumers and is continuously incurring losses on account of unaccounted for gas (UFG) – a term used for gas theft and leakages – for the past three years.
It has been learnt that the two government-nominated directors and the company secretary have resigned from the board/ company because of illegal directives and irregularities in the board’s affairs, such as failure to record board proceedings, changing of minutes and interference in management’s affairs, rendering the management paralysed.
Sources revealed that the harsh and unfair policies of the company board had caused frustration among employees and officers equally, resulting in sit-ins and court cases.
Stakeholders associated with SSGC are now looking towards the coalition government, expecting it to take the right steps and appoint professionally competent directors to steer the company out of the quagmire.
When contacted, State Minister for Petroleum Musadik Malik and secretary petroleum did not respond to the request for comment.
An SECP spokesperson told The Express Tribune “Section 158(2) of the Companies Act 2017 empowers the registrar to grant extension for holding a general meeting in which elections are to be held by a company.”
In terms of Section 158(3) of the Act, the registrar may, upon expiry of the extended time period, may direct the company to hold the meeting for the election of directors, either upon its own motion or upon representation of the members holding not less than one-tenth of the total voting powers or one-tenth of the total members of the company, the spokesperson added.

6,Tax revenues short by Rs276b,May compel IMF to demand a cut in expenses or the imposition of new taxes,"During the first nine months of this fiscal year, Pakistan sustained a tax shortfall of Rs276 billion that sharply widened in March despite a mini-budget, which may compel the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to demand for either a further cut in expenses or the imposition of new taxes.
According to officials from the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), against a target of Rs5.433 trillion, the bureau provisionally collected nearly Rs5.16 trillion during the July-March period of this fiscal year. The collection remained short of the target by Rs276 billion despite the government introducing a mini-budget in mid-February. The government had increased the standard General Sales Tax (GST) rate to 18% apart from increasing the rate to 25% on dozens of goods.
Against the Rs727 billion monthly target, the FBR only collected a mere Rs663 billion in March –sustaining a Rs64 billion shortfall in the month. Almost all field formations failed to achieve their respective targets, with the monthly growth in tax collection at only 16% in March.
Pakistan had assured the IMF that currency devaluation would help collect an additional Rs180 billion in the current fiscal year, but the February and March collection numbers will put the country under some additional pressure from the lender. According to an understanding with the IMF, in case of a shortfall in tax revenues, the government will make adjustments in expenses or levy more taxes to cover the gap.
The slowdown in imports and economic growth has hurt the FBR’s revenues, which for years has blindly relied on imports to boost revenues. The Ministry of Finance on Friday hinted at almost a flat gross domestic product (GDP) growth during the current fiscal year.
The nearly Rs5.16 trillion collection during this fiscal year was Rs766 billion more than the same period of the last fiscal year, showing a growth rate of 17.4%. The nominal economic growth rate stood at around 36% in March on the back of a near 50-year high inflation rate, indicating that the FBR is not able to fully take advantage of higher prices.
So far, the government has imposed nearly Rs800 billion in additional taxes, including measures worth Rs170 billion implemented from February. The widening gap between the collection and target indicates that it may now be difficult for the FBR to hit the annual goalpost of Rs7.640 trillion.
The overall collection of customs duty remained below target for all nine months of the current fiscal year. The FBR collected slightly over Rs700 billion in custom duties, which was Rs134 billion lower than the target. The nine-month custom duty collection also fell below last year’s level by nearly Rs15 billion.
The tax targets had been set on the assumption that monthly imports would be around $5.1 billion but, in March, imports may remain below $4 billion. In March alone, the custom duty collection remained below the target by Rs35 billion.
Income tax collection in nine months amounted to Rs2.3 trillion, up by Rs724 billion, or 46%. The collection exceeded the target by Rs109 billion. In March, the FBR collected Rs287 billion in income tax, exceeding the target by Rs62 billion, helped by the higher value of the dollar and increased taxes on the salaried class.
Sales tax remained another weak area, as the collection amounted to Rs1.9 trillion in nine months – Rs205 billion less than the target, showing that the FBR was unable to reap the benefit of the a 32% inflation rate.
The sales tax collection at the import stage constituted nearly 64% of the total collection under this head. The nine-month GST collection was a mere Rs33 billion more than the last fiscal year, putting a serious question mark over the efficiency of the revenue board.
In March, the FBR pooled Rs276 billion in sales taxes, missing the target by Rs67 billion despite an increase in the GST rate.
Federal excise duty collection stood at Rs245 billion, missing the target by Rs50 billion despite an increase in the FED rate on cigarettes and beverages.

7,Late export proceeds to be fined up to 9%,SBP tightens rules to discourage traders from creating artificial shortage of dollars,"Pakistan’s central bank has issued new regulations to tighten the process of repatriating export earnings into the country. Under the new rules, exporters who delay bringing their export earnings into the country will face fines of up to 9% of their realised export proceeds. The fines will be imposed if export proceeds are realised fully or partially after the prescribed period of up to 180 days, or earlier in some cases.
Exporters often delay receipt of payments from their global buyers in anticipation of a better rupee-dollar exchange rate, creating an artificial shortage of US dollars in the domestic economy and triggering depreciation in the local currency. Such delays also reduce the supply of US dollars in the economy, causing unnecessary rupee depreciation against the greenback. Pakistan, which is already managing with critically low foreign exchange reserves and a high risk of default on foreign debt repayments, cannot afford such delays.
According to a notification released by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Friday, in the case where export proceeds are realised (fully or partially) after the prescribed period (a maximum 180 days in majority cases or earlier), authorised dealers (mostly commercial banks) will convert the export proceeds at the prevailing market exchange rate and credit the same into the exporters’ account. They will also mark a 3% lien on the amount of export proceeds delayed by up to 30 days, 6% on realisation of export proceeds delayed by more than 30 days to a maximum of 60 days, and 9% on export payment received with a delay of more than 60 days.
The instructions will be applicable with immediate effect, and the fines will be deposited with the SBP. However, the instructions will not be applicable in case of export bills/export receivables discounted by the exporters to the authorised dealers.
“(Moreover), in view of the representation received from various stakeholders, it has been decided that exporter who are able to bring their delayed export proceeds to Pakistan by April 30, 2023, will not face any deductions and their export proceeds will be converted into rupees and released to them in a normal fashion,” reads the notification.
The central bank also instructed the authorised dealers to release to exporters the amount withheld, deducted early under the previous regulations made on February 13, 2023. “The amounts withheld by the ADS in pursuance of… (previous) instructions will also be released to the exporters,” read the central bank’s notification.
The notification further added that the Foreign Exchange Operations Department (FEOD) shall file a complaint to Foreign Exchange Adjudication Department (FEAD) of the SBP with respect to a delay in the realisation of export proceeds for all reported cases.

“Subsequently, AD shall deposit the fine as ordered by FEAD with the SBP out of the amount marked under lien… and release the remaining amount to the exporter. In case the FEAD does not impose any fine on the exporter, the entire amount under lien will be released to the exporter.”
The Foreign Exchange Manual 2002 and a concerned circular elaborated that “exporters are now required to repatriate the export proceeds on the due date for payment or within six months from the date of shipment, whichever is earlier.”
In some cases, however, like the export of carpets or exports to South American countries, the proceeds may be received within 285 days.
Speaking to the Express Tribune Pak-Kuwait Investment Company, Head of Research Samiullah Tariq said that the aim of the latest amendments in the Foreign Exchange Manual is to bring in the export proceeds to the country in a timely manner and better manage the foreign exchange reserves.
“Sometimes, exporters take a view that the rupee may be depreciated further and hence delay receipt of export proceeds,” he said. The rupee’s depreciation always suits exporters, as this fetches them a higher amount in rupee value.
In the past two months, the rupee has devalued by 19% or Rs54 to around Rs284 against the greenback in the interbank market.
Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves have dropped by $354 million to $2.24 billion in the week ended on March 24, 2023. The reserves are barely enough to finance exports for around a month. Low reserves have resulted in cutting imports by almost half at $4 billion a month and partially shutting down the domestic economy.
The country is in talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to resume its $6.5 billion loan program, which has been stalled since November 2022. The last condition for reviving the program is acquiring guarantees of financial commitment worth around $6-7 billion from friendly countries.
The central bank has fully reopened imports on the recommendation of the IMF last week. These new regulations are expected to ensure the timely receipt of export proceeds into the country and better management of foreign exchange reserves, crucial for the country’s economic stability.

8,"NTDC, KE blamed for Jan blackout",Regulator releases inquiry report on power breakdown after two-month delay,"The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has released its inquiry report on the countrywide blackout in January 2023, after a delay of two months.
It held National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC), K-Electric (KE), Port Qasim Power Company Limited and Central Power Generation Company Limited (CPGCL) responsible for the power breakdown across the country on January 23, 2023.
The report said that the contributing factors for cascaded tripping were the injection of wind power in the South and curtailment of hydel generation at Ghazi Barotha Power Station in the North by the National Power Control Centre (NPCC).
The running back of Port Qasim Power Plant, instead of shutting down, at over-frequency setting was another contributing factor.
The national grid system and KE system were completely restored at 03:22 am and 05:08 am, respectively, on January 24.
The factors for delayed restoration were frequent tripping of Tarbela units, late synchronisation of Tarbela and Mangla Power Stations by system operator and delayed availability of power plants despite Notice to Sync (NTS) by the system operator.
Causes and faults, which resulted in cascaded tripping and system collapse, included the induction of power in the South and reduction of generation in the North, which caused oscillation in the system and gave rise to “power swing”.
Power swing could not be controlled due to the non-operation of protection devices. Hence, in the South initially over-frequency and later under-frequency whereas only under-frequency in the North caused the cascaded tripping of lines and power houses, which resulted in total blackout in the country.
The report held NTDC, CPGCL, Port Qasim Power Company Limited and KE jointly responsible for the incident. NTDC was held responsible for issuing dispatch instructions without due consideration of the prevailing network conditions, inconsistent protection settings and non-activation of out-of-step splitting system.
CPGCL was held responsible for unavailability of its 747MW Guddu station in the system on account of non-insurance.
Port Qasim Power Company failed to trip at the set over-frequency values while KE failed to remain in island mode due to the tripping of Bin Qasim Power Station-II (BQPS-II).
According to the inquiry report, the delay in restoration of NTDC system was mainly due to the failed attempts at black start facilities of Wapda hydel power stations and Kot Addu Power Company (Kapco).
Other factors included delay in synchronisation of various power plants and unavailability of Scada system at NPCC. KE system restoration was also delayed due to the repeated failed attempts at their black start facilities.
The report recommended carrying out a compensation study and taking required measures in light of the study to avoid power swing.
“Stability of high-voltage, direct-current (HVDC) system needs to be ensured through a proper study to avoid frequent signals of ‘commutation failure’,” it said.
“NTDC staff needs to be trained for thorough understanding of HVDC transmission system.”
It stressed that a fully functional Scada facility was essentially required for the system operator in order to ensure on-line monitoring of system parameters for the sake of system security, stability and analysis of events.
It called for ensuring the implementation of protection settings, issued by the NTDC for power plants. “NTDC shall ensure the healthiness and operation of recently installed out-of-step devices, as the same did not operate during the event,” it said.
According to the report, the quantum of load to be rejected through the under-frequency schemes needs to be increased, especially in the southern region, where it is considerably less. And simultaneous tripping of K2/K3 units on over-frequency should be made stage-wise.
SECL, Thal Nova and Thar Energy plants, which are not included in the over-frequency tripping scheme, shall be considered, it said.
