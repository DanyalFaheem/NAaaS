0,Inflation soars to 50-year high,Country at the doors of hyperinflation,"The annual inflation rate accelerated to 35.4% in March -- the highest in nearly five decades – as erosion in the people’s purchasing power has resulted in a surge in street crimes and stampedes as people rush to get free food.
The Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) on Saturday reported that the Consumer Price Index rose to 35.4% — a worrisome reading that the central bank may now use as a base to further hike the interest rates on Tuesday.
The 35.4% inflation rate was the highest in the past 50 years but still slightly lower than the 37.8% reading recorded in December 1973.
The data suggested that the country was at the doors of hyperinflation. The food inflation was over 50% in rural areas. There were six consumer price groups that saw the inflation rate over 40%, including alcoholic beverages and tobacco that witnessed the highest ever inflation rate of 140%.

Pakistanis have been bitten by record price hikes caused by a shortage of commodities due to floods, unchecked hoarding, currency devaluation, hike in tax rates and increase in fuel prices and electricity and gas tariffs to meet the conditions set by the International Monetary Fund.
So far, around 21 people have died, including children, across the country to get free wheat flour or receive donations, underscoring the fact that the people have lost everything to make their ends meet and the situation has reached such a critical level where people are risking their lives to get food.
Street crimes have seen a dramatic rise as robbers have been making daring attempts by snatching mobiles and looting shops in areas that were earlier considered safe in a direct challenge to the state writ.
There was hardly any consumable good that had not seen its price shot up in recent months. The PBS announced its readings just a day before the Monetary Policy Committee has scheduled its meeting. In the last huddle called on the IMF direction, the central bank had increased the interest rate to the highest ever level of 20%.
The factors that are contributing to the hike in inflation cannot be addressed by merely increasing the interest rates. In its monthly economic outlook, the finance ministry had stated on Friday that the contractionary monetary policies could not contain inflation.
Pakistan’s inflation rate was now the 15th highest in the world and it was likely to remain elevated because of the currency devaluation; hike in electricity and gas tariffs; and imposition of more taxes to meet the conditions agreed with the IMF.
The core inflation, which was calculated after excluding the volatile energy and food prices, increased in March to 18.6% in urban areas and 23.1% in rural areas.
Despite constantly increasing the interest rates, the core inflation has not receded that should be a matter of concern for the monetary policy committee members. The core inflation was still higher than the central bank’s upward revised policy rate of 20%, indicating the underlying inflationary pressures.
The inflation rate remained elevated in rural areas where it was recorded at 38.9% while it jumped to 33% in the cities, according to the PBS.
There was a huge increase in the food inflation rate, mostly because of disruption of supply chains and weak checks. The food inflation rose steeply to 50.2% in rural areas and 47.1% in cities last month, the PBS data showed.
The federal and the provincial governments are unable to ensure even the essential food supplies for the majority of the people. The prices are soaring at a time when the economy has significantly slowed down and poverty as well as unemployment surged exponentially.
The inflation rate for the transport consumer price group was 55%, recreation and culture (51%), beverages and tobacco groups (140%), and for perishable food group, it was 52%.
The price of onion increased by 258% in cities and 303% in villages in March against the same month a year ago followed by 177% increase in the rates of cigarettes, tea 105%, wheat 94%, eggs 83%, ice 82% and wheat flour 70%.

Wheat -- an essential staple food of an overwhelming majority of Pakistanis -- has exceeded their reach after the coalition government took a political decision of increasing the staple food prices by 77% to Rs3,900 per 40kg.
The prices of pulses jumped up by over 60% while vegetable ghee and cooking oil prices surged around 42% last month compared to a year ago, according to the PBS.
The non-food inflation rate increased to 24% in cities and 28.5% in rural areas.
For the July-March period of the current fiscal year, the data showed that the average inflation rate stood at 27.3%, which was more than double the official target of 11.5% for the current fiscal year set before the floods.

1,Seven SC benches formed amid govt's no-trust,Justice Ahsan and Justice Akhtar hearing PTI's plea against polls delay,"Despite the coalition government expressing its lack of confidence in the Supreme Court bench hearing the polls delay case, Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial has formed seven of them to hear cases in Islamabad next week.
On April 3, a top court special bench, comprising CJP Bandial, Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Muneeb Akhtar, will hear the petition filed by the PTI against the delay in the elections in Punjab.
According to the cause list issued by the SC Registrar’s Office, seven benches will hear the cases at the Islamabad principal seat.
The first bench will comprise the CJP himself and Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar; Justice Isa and Justice Yahya Afridi in the second one; the third bench will comprise Justice Sardar Tariq Masood, Justice Aminuddin Khan and Justice Athar Minallah; Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Hasan Azhar Rizvi on the fourth one; the fifth bench will comprise Justice Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Jamal Mandokhail; Justice Muneeb Akhtar and Justice Mazahar Akbar Naqvi in the sixth one; and the seventh bench will comprise Justice Ayesha Malik and Justice Shahid Waheed.

On April 4, a three-member special bench, headed by Justice Akhtar, will hear the petitions filed in connection with the Federal Government Employees Housing Authority (FGEHA) and the policy about the allotment of plots to bureaucrats and judges in Sector F-14 and F-15 of Islamabad.
On February 3, 2021, the Islamabad High Court declared the allotment of plots to judges, bureaucrats and government employees in the special sectors of the federal capital as “unconstitutional”.
The IHC verdict had affected six sitting judges and many retired ones.
In March, the SC expressed its surprise over the IHC initiating suo motu proceedings in an FGEHA scheme case.

On April 5, important cases will be heard in the apex court including that of the bail cancellation of former Balochistan health minister Rehmat Saleh Baloch in a National Accountability Bureau (NAB) reference against him.
The former provincial minister faces charges of opening bank accounts in the name of his brothers, relatives and low-ranking employees to transfer embezzled money into them.
A two-member bench, headed by Justice Ahsan, will also hear the petitions filed against the dismissal of the law officers sacked by the Punjab caretaker government.

2,MNAs seek probe into alleged corrupt Hajj practices,Ministry extends deadline for submission of Hajj apps,"The members of the National Assembly on Friday sought a probe into alleged corrupt practices for including applicants, who had not qualified for balloting, among successful Hajj pilgrims after taking bribes from them.
MNAs Dr Mahreen Razzaq Bhutto and Sheikh Fayyazuddin during the Question Hour session made queries pertaining to the criteria of posting staff on Hajj duties, alleging that corruption was committed by the Ministry of Religious Affairs in including names in the list of successful pilgrims.
Mahreen of the Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarians (PPPP) asked the religious affairs minister to apprise the house that the staff who already performed three Hajj was sent again or not to avoid discrimination among other employees to render official duties during Hajj operations in Saudi Arabia.
She also asked him to clear the policy details in this regard.
MNA Fayyazuddin of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) alleged that the ministry officials took Rs30,000 from Hujjaj to add their names in the successful ballot list, saying: ""Will this continue this year as well or the ministry will take any action?""
Minister for Religious Affairs Mufti Abdul Shakoor said the federal cabinet used to sanction approval to the Hajj and after that, the minister used to assign duties to its staff.
He added that there was no limitation in that policy after the principle decision that one official who performed three Hajj should not be sent again. However, he said the experienced staff was sent after a discussion with senior officials.
The minister underlined that the ministry had proper committees to ensure monitoring in Makkah and Madina whereas a medical mission headed by a senior doctor, a core committee and Hajj committees were present there to ensure proper management of the staff.
The minister urged the members to identify the officials involved in the alleged corrupt practices and the ministry would ensure disciplinary action with full cooperation.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Religious Affairs on Friday extended the deadline for the submission of applications under the Regular Hajj Scheme till Sunday, April 2.
According to the spokesperson, the designated banks would be open to receive Hajj applications on weekends – Saturdays and Sundays.
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) was approached by the designated banks for permission to remain open.
The spokesperson said the last date to submit applications for the Sponsorship Hajj Scheme had been extended till next Sunday, April 9.
The decision to extend the deadlines was made due to the difficulties in receiving remittances from overseas Pakistanis.
Last week, the Ministry of Religious Affairs had ruled out the possibility of extending the last date to submit Hajj applications.

3,‘United’ PDM piles pressure on ‘divided’ SC,Calls impending Punjab election verdict ‘unacceptable’,"Anticipating an adverse decision from a Supreme Court bench in the Punjab elections’ delay case, the coalition government on Saturday held an important meeting, wherein it was decided that any decision of the three judges on the matter would be “unacceptable”.
Expressing their lack of confidence in the three-member bench comprising Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial, Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Muneeb Akhtar, the ruling parties observed that the majority of judges had ruled against intervening in the matter.
They added that the majority of judges had demanded that the SC should cease the hearing of the case as well as alleged that the purpose of taking it up seemed to accord a special preference to a certain party.
To discuss the issue of the SC bench hearing the PTI petition’s against holding the elections in Punjab in October, the meeting, presided over by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, was attended via video link by PPP Co-chairperson Asif Ali Zardari; his son Foreign Minister and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari; Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) President and JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman; and PML-N Senior Vice President Maryam Nawaz.

The participants of the meeting demanded that elections should be held simultaneously throughout the country. They emphasised that ignoring the constitutional prerequisite of holding transparent, free, and fair elections would push Pakistan towards catastrophic political instability as well as was tantamount to launching a suicide attack on the financial interests of the country.
It was decided that they would not allow any state institution to push the country towards anarchy under the pressure of one political party.
The participants of the meeting agreed that an administrative matter was turned into a full-blown constitutional and political crisis.
They observed that ignoring security, legal, and political realities would be tantamount to remaining aloof from the interests of the country.

It was said that the petition was being heard with a special purpose of giving relief to a party.
The participants noted that Article 218(3) of the Constitution and other provisions gave the sole prerogative to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to decide the matters related to polls.
They added that any decision coming from some other institution would be tantamount to intervening in the domain of the ECP.
The participants of the meeting expressed no confidence in the three-member bench led by the CJP.
They demanded that in light of the suo motu case 1/2023, the ongoing hearing of the case should be ceased.
The participants of the huddle alleged that the SC was trying to convert a minority decision to a majority one.
They were of the view that this matter was only creating a legal and constitutional impasse.
The ruling coalition believed that the decision of the five-member bench wherein the ECP was instructed to hold elections in Punjab and K-P at the earliest, was announced three to two even though it was actually four to three.
It added that the dissenting notes of two judges were not part of the order issued by the five-member bench.
The participants of the meeting emphasised that the decision of SC’s Senior Pusine Judge Justice Qazi Faez Isa to stop all hearings under 148(3) should also be respected.
They added that contradictory decisions had complicated the situation.
The participants of the meeting demanded that the Pakistan Bar Council and other lawyer bodies' reference 209 should be heard at the earliest.

The participants of the huddle also expressed their dismay over the inclusion of Justice Ahsan even after he had voluntarily recused himself from the bench.
They demanded that Justice Ahsan should be excluded from the bench.
The meeting demanded that the CJP should take stock of the dissenting voices of fellow judges, requesting him to call a full-court hearing to undo the impression of a “one-man show”.
The huddle declared that the decision on Article 63 (A) of a three-judge bench of the SC had created political instability in the country and rewrote the Constitution.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar briefed the participants on the developing situation in the SC benches after the exchange of dissenting notes between its judges.
Finance Minister Ishaq Dar briefed the participants on the economic situation of the country.
The courts had already ruled in favour of holding the elections at the earliest, but the ECP delayed elections till October, citing security and financial reasons.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Federal Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said the decision of the current bench would be unacceptable to the government.
She added that when the ruling coalition had rejected the bench, how it could accept its decision.
The minister continued that the purpose of the huddle was to consult with all the allied parties.

4,Imran urges SC to stand firm against ‘sinister’ coalition,Says PTI will take to streets if elections not held within 90 days,"Sensing sinister motives behind the Pakistan Democratic Movement’s (PDM) demand to delay elections in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and reconstitution of the Supreme Court bench, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan on Saturday said their (PDM leaders) only aim was to crush his party in an effort to pave way for easy victory.
“It suits the PDM to delay the elections so that they gain time to crush the PTI,” the former prime minister said while addressing the nation through video link.
Comparing the time when a five-member bench overturned his decision of dissolving the National Assembly and calling early elections, Imran said, “We accepted the Supreme Court’s last year verdict even though it was against us and I stopped my party leaders and supports from criticising the judiciary”.
“Now, the PDM says that it will not accept the Supreme Court’s verdict if it goes against them,” the PTI chairman said citing the ruling coalition meeting in Lahore.
He said that after 90 days, the interim set-up would lose its legitimacy and went on to castigate the caretaker Punjab government for exceeding the powers that were given to them. He said that the non-representative interim government was only focused on crushing the PTI and abusing its financial powers.

He accused the interim government in Punjab of harassing the PTI leaders and workers; “3100 party workers have been arrested for no reason”.
The PTI chairman warned the coalition government of launching nationwide protests if elections were not held in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa within 90 days.
“If elections are not held within 90 days the country will be without a Constitution,” former premier maintained while speaking to journalists at his Lahore Zaman Park residence.
Imran negated the impression that President Arif Alvi was playing the role of a bridge between the PTI and the establishment.
“Under what law Punjab and K-P assemblies can be restored [if elections are not held within the stipulated time],” he questioned.
Imran said they would take to the streets if polls are not held within 90 days.
Taking a dig at former army chief, Imran said General (retd) Qamar Javed Bajwa wanted “friendship with India” for which he had “pressurised” him, and, therefore, the relationship between “us deteriorated”.
“The former army chief should be held accountable by the army.”
Commenting on the current political situation, the former premier said PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi and President Chaudhry Pervez Elahi had been given the task of re-establishing contacts with other political parties.
He said there was no restriction on any PTI member to meet other parties and political figures.
Imran flayed caretaker Punjab Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi and CCPO Lahore Bilal Siddique Kamyana for carrying out police raid at his Zaman Park residence on March 18, saying both of them were “criminals”.
“There was no reason for attack on my house in my absence. A case has been prepared in this connection and will be filed soon,” he said.
Meanwhile, on the directives of party chairman, PTI Central President Chaudhry Parvez Elahi contacted via phone Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s (MQM-P) convener Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, senior leader Mustafa Kamal, Dr Waseem Akhtar, Pakistan Awami Tahreek (PAT) chief Dr Tahirul Qadri’s son Dr Hasan Mohiuddin, secretary general Khurram Nawaz Gandapur and Jamiat Ahle Hadith Pakistan’s emir Allama Zubair Ahmad Zaheer and discussed the current political situation, including the supremacy of the Constitution.
Several political leaders, including former provincial ministers Mian Mehmoodur Rasheed, Muhammad Basharat Raja and former MPA Abdullah Yousuf, also called on Elahi at his residence to deliberate on the current political crisis.
Terming the coalition government’s demand of full court to hear the PTI’s plea challenging the postponement of elections, Elahi termed it “drum beating”, saying it was meant to avoid polls.
“The demand of full court on part of fugitive Nawaz Sharif is ridiculous.  He escaped jail by lying and is now instructing the judiciary.”
The former Punjab chief minister said Nawaz’s demand had proved that “strings of conspiracy” against the apex court were being “pulled from London”.
Elahi further said that the IMF and the international community had come to know that Premier Shehbaz Sharif’s government was on “crutches with no future”.
“Coalition government can fall anytime. That is why Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates are not ready to give guarantee for Shehbaz and Ishaq Dar [to extend loans],” he said.
He said the global community was seeing PTI as a party that would come to power in the next few months.
“There is a positive and pleasant change in the attitude of United States. Even in American think tanks, there are discussions about Imran Khan’s extraordinary popularity and becoming the prime minister again.”
Separately, PTI senior leader Fawad Chaudhry said that meetings of “fascist criminals” who are “guilty of violating the Constitution” had no value.
He was referring to the coalition government’s Saturday moot which was held to discuss the Supreme Court’s bench hearing the PTI’s plea against the postponement of Punjab polls.

5,Four soldiers martyred in Pak-Iran border attack,"According to the ISPR, contact is being established with the Iranian side for effective action against terrorists","Four Pakistan Army soldiers embraced martyrdom on Saturday after a group of terrorists operating from the Iranian side attacked a routine border patrol of security forces operating along the Pakistan-Iran border in the Jalgai Sector of Kech district.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the martyred soldiers were identified as Naik Shair Ahmed, Lance Naik Muhammad Asghar Ali, Sepoy Muhammad Irfanullah and Sepoy Abdur Rasheed who were critically injured and later embraced martyrdom.
Naik Ahmed, 37, who stopped the terrorists by sacrificing his life on the soil of the country, belonged to Kohlu district, while his martyrdom left his widow, three sons and two daughters bereaved.

Lance Naik Ali, 34, hailed from Kot Addu, Muzaffargarh district and is survived by his widow and five sons.
Sepoy Irfanullah, 22, hailed from Dera Ghazi Khan district and his bereaved family includes a widow and a daughter.
Sepoy Rasheed, 24, from Sohbatpur district left behind a bereaved father in tears.
“Necessary contact is being made with Iran for effective action against terrorists, so that such incidents of terrorism can be prevented in the future,” the military media wing stated.
Pakistan expressed a strong reaction to this heinous act of terrorism, the ISPR added.

6,Tremors kill three children in Balochistan,"Five people, including three women, injured in mishap","Three children were killed and five others injured after a 3.5-magnitude earthquake struck Chaman, Pakistan’s bordering city with Afghanistan in the wee hours of Saturday.
Babar Yousafzai, the Balochistan chief minister’s spokesperson, told The Express Tribune that two houses collapsed in the tremors.
Three children – 12-year-old Palwasha, eight-year-old Sajawal and 10-year-old Amina – were killed when the roof of their mud-walled house collapsed in the Killi Bilalzai area of Chaman district.
Meanwhile, five people, including three women, were also injured in the mishap in the same house.
The injured were shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital Chaman where an emergency was declared.
Yousafzai said that the quake measured 3.5 on the Richter scale.

He said no one was harmed in the other house.
The Levies Force personnel and the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) staff reached the damaged house to help the injured.
Last month, 10 people died, including two women and two children, after a quake struck various parts of the country.
All the deaths occurred in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P). However, the PDMA gave a lower tally of 62 injured from earlier reports of nearly 180.
It said 10 houses were destroyed, while 55 were partially damaged.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said the 6.8-magnitude earthquake had its epicentre in Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan at a depth of 180 kilometres. The United States Geological Survey said that the 6.5 tremor centred near Jurm in Badakhshan.
K-P had, so far, been the worst-affected by the strong earthquake that rattled the region, including Afghanistan, some parts of Central Asia and India.
Tremors were also felt in several cities of Punjab and Balochistan but there were no reports of casualties. However, cracks appeared in several high-rise buildings in Rawalpindi and elsewhere.
Large parts of South Asia were seismically active because a tectonic plate known as the Indian plate was pushing north into the Eurasian plate.
A 6.3-magnitude earthquake jolted parts of the federal capital on January 29 while another 5.6-magnitude quake shook several K-P districts on January 19.

7,Crisis deepens as another judge recuses himself,"CJP Bandial gave clear message that elections of provincial assemblies 'will be held, come what may'","Crisis within the Supreme Court has further deepened as another judge, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, recused himself from the larger bench hearing the case regarding the delay in provincial assemblies’ elections.
The lawyers were questioning what would be the legitimacy of the judicial proceedings wherein voices were being raised within the SC on the matter related to the postponement of elections of provincial assemblies.
Next week would be very crucial in the prevailing situation wherein there was also clash within the SC.
An unpleasant happening was witnessed, when the SC registrar on Friday issued a circular disregarding the two judges’ judicial order wherein it was held that hearing of all cases under Article 184 (3) of the Constitution be postponed until amendments were made in the SC Rules 1980 regarding CJP's discretionary powers to form special benches.
Now, the question arose whether a judicial order could be disregarded through an administrative order passed by the CJP.
The debate continued on what would be the consequences of issuance of the circular. It was expected that a section of the SC judges would give a strong reaction over the move in the next couple of days.
A lawyer opined that instead of disregarding the administrative side, the “bench should have suspended the order for the time being”.
He said that contempt might be issued to the SC registrar over issuance of the circular. However, next week would be further crucial about the present state of affairs within the SC.
Following the circular as well as recusal of Justice Mandokhail, Pakistan Bar Council Executive Committee Chairman Hasan Raza Pasha urged the CJP to summon a full court meeting to discuss the prevailing situation.
Read Dissolution of bench makes no difference: Imran
The chief justice, however, said that they were working to call a full court meeting in the next couple of days.
However, it was learnt that the temperature was so high within the SC that there were less chances that the judges of both the sides would sit to discuss certain issues.
A lawyer said, “The CJP should have consulted the judges before issuance of the circular.”
The most alarming thing was that Justice Mandokhail in his judicial note regarding his recusal said that three judges – namely CJP Bandial, Justice Ijaz ul Ahsan, and Justice Munib Akhtar – dictated the order in his absence and without contacting him for participation in the deliberations.
“I felt that the three learned members of the bench, for reasons best known to them, opted not to involve me in the consultation,” the note said.
The order also reflected how the SC judges were divided.
CJP Bandial’s clear message
It was witnessed during Friday’s hearing that CJP Bandial had given a clear message to the executive authorities as well as the establishment that elections of provincial assemblies “will be held, come what may”.
Likewise, he was standing with Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi who was facing a tough time by them on the charges of misconduct.
Giving reason for including Justice Naqvi in the nine-member larger bench, CJP Bandial said that there was a silent way of communication with the world.
Justice Bandial also stated that he was the only superior court judge left who was ousted on account of not taking oath under November 3, 2007 Provisional Constitutional Order.
He said that later a miracle happened as he was again reinstated on his post as a judge of the Lahore High Court.

For the first time, Justice Bandial addressed the establishment during the hearing.
He wondered that security was not being provided by the armed forces on account of terrorism, which existed in the country for the last 20 years.
CJP Bandial also made it clear that they would ask directly for the reason behind not providing security in the elections.
At the end, the CJP asked the AGP to come along with the defence secretary before the bench on Monday.
He said that if the SC order regarding the holding of general elections was not implemented then executive authorities would face consequences.
It was debatable whether a divided SC could compel the military to provide security in the elections.
A PML-N lawyer, however, said that the CJP’s remarks reflected his frustration that he was being isolated within the court.
Though all segments of society, fellow judges, lawyers and political parties, including the petitioner party PTI, had no objection to the constitution of a full court, the bench was reluctant without giving any valid reason.
CJP Bandial also admitted that the SC was divided after filing of the presidential reference against Justice Qazi Faez Isa.
He said that both Justice Isa and the SC suffered for two years.
The CJP believed that the complaint against Justice Naqvi was a tax issue which should be dealt by the tax authorities. However, a lawyer said, “If charges against Justice Naqvi are false, the CJP should place his matter before Supreme Judicial Council for his exoneration.”
It was interesting that a three-judge bench led by CJP Bandial did not examine whether the petitioner – PTI – came before the SC without ill intention.
It was being said that the constitutional institutions could be ineffective after passing of the resolution of no confidence against former prime minister Imran Khan. The PTI left the National Assembly after Imran’s ouster. Later, they dissolved both the provincial assemblies without any valid reason.

8,Govt paints gloomy outlook of economy,"Ministry says political instability, delay in IMF deal causing distress","The government, while projecting further hike in inflation coupled with a slowdown of the economy, on Friday said that delay in finalising a deal with the International Monetary Fund was causing economic distress in the country.
In its monthly outlook report, the economic adviser wing of the finance ministry also said that political instability has started feeding strong inflationary expectations.
While holding back its inflation forecast figure for the outgoing month, the finance ministry painted a gloomy outlook of the economy. It said that the Monthly Economic Indicator -- a tool to predict the economic growth rate based on the past and current indicators -- has further slowed.
The report also revealed that the total cost of the PM’s free wheat flour subsidy was nearly Rs100 billion, including Rs15.6 billion that the government of Sindh was disbursing through a preferred targeted mechanism under the Benazir Income Support Programme. Punjab will give Rs64 billion wheat flour subsidy and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Rs19.7 billion in an untargeted manner.
“Inflation in March may remain in the upper bound as observed in February when it was 31.5%,” the finance ministry stated. Although the ministry did not give a figure this time, the market is expecting inflation shooting up to 36% due to a host of negative measures.
A conservative internal assessment of the finance ministry suggested around 34% inflation rate in March. The finance ministry said that a “potential reason of rising price level is political and economic uncertainty”.
The ministry also noted that delay in finalising the IMF programme was causing more pains. “The economic distress resulting from delay of the stabilisation programme has exacerbated the economic uncertainty due to which inflationary expectations have remained strong,” the report said.
Pakistan has been struggling hard to revive the $6.5 billion derailed IMF programme, although its own missteps like the petrol subsidy and attempts to directly borrow from commercial banks have further complicated the matters for the country.
The finance ministry said that even the contractionary monetary policies were not helping to contain inflation.
“Despite the SBP's contractionary monetary policy, the inflationary expectations are not settling down,” said the finance ministry in a remark that shows its dissatisfaction with the central bank’s tight monetary policy.
The SBP increased the policy rate by 3% to 20% in the last Monetary Policy decision held this month.
The monthly outlook stated that the bulk buying during Ramadan may cause demand supply gap and result in the prices of essential items to escalate. Due to the lagged effect of floods, production losses, especially of major agriculture crops, have not yet been fully recovered. Consequently, the shortage of essential items has emerged and persisted.
As a result, “inflation is expected to stay at elevated levels owing to market frictions caused by relative demand and supply gap of essential items, exchange rate depreciation and recent upward adjustment of administered prices of petrol and diesel”, it added.
The report stated that the prime minister has announced a Ramzan package under which providing free wheat flour will be provided to the inflation-hit people.
It added that the government of Punjab has allocated Rs64 billion whereby 15.8 million households falling in poverty would be provided three free flour bags of 10kg each. Earlier, Punjab's subsidy estimate was Rs53 billion.
Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa has announced Rs19.7 billion to provide three wheat flour bags of 10kg amongst its 5.8 million households. The government of Balochistan will distribute 0.5 million flour bags of 20kg. However, the government of Sindh has announced Rs15.6 billion to provide Rs2,000 to purchase wheat flour by its 7.8 million families registered with BISP, according to the finance ministry.
Another inflationary factor was the decision to increase the wheat support price by 77% to Rs39,000 per 40kg for the next crop. For Rabi season 2022-23, the harvest of wheat crop has been started in Sindh while it is going to be harvested in Punjab by the end of March.
Economic Outlook
The finance ministry stated that the average Monthly Economic Indicator (MEI) during the first eight months of the current fiscal year is indicating a further slowdown in domestic economic activities. This seems to be driven by lack of industrial dynamism, accelerating inflation, which erodes the purchasing power of consumers and investors, and is also illustrated by negative growth in exports and imports.
The indicator was already in the negative territory since the start of the fiscal year. The finance ministry’s latest assessment indicates that there may not be any growth during the current fiscal year, if no improvement is witnessed in the remainder period.
The MEI is developed as a tool to distribute the past annual GDP numbers, as reported by the PBS, on a monthly and quarterly basis and to forecast on that same frequency GDP growth for the fiscal year in which the national accounts are not yet available.
There was also depressing news on large scale manufacturing, as the report stated that “year-on-year growth of LSM is expected to remain negative in February while monthly LSM is expected to remain positive”.
LSM performance remained under pressure and witnessed a contraction of 4.4% during July-January period owing to increasingly synchronised policy stance to correct the imbalances, supply chain disruptions and recessionary global pressure. The performance of the auto industry also remains subdued due to massive increases in input prices, tightening auto finance, and import restrictions.
Fiscal performance
Fiscal deficit during the first seven month of the current fiscal year has been contained to 2.3% of the GDP against 2.8% of GDP last year. Total expenditures grew by 10%, largely driven by the expenditures on mark-up payments which grew 73% due to higher servicing on domestic and foreign debt as a result of higher interest rates, according to the report.
On the other hand, non-mark-up expenditures reduced by 26% owing to a significant decline in the subsidies and grants.
For the month of March, it is expected that the exports and the imports will remain at current levels due to slow growth in the major trading partners and contained domestic economic activities. However, remittances will probably further improve due to a positive seasonal and Ramadan factor. Taking these factors into account, the current account deficit is likely to remain on lower side.
Through demand management policies, the government is trying to limit the current account deficit, which will not transfer further pressure on dwindling reserves, it added.
