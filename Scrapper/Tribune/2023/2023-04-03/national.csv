0,Tax reforms: swimming in a quagmire,Progressive taxation a humungous problem for political leaders just ahead of polls,"A number of governments, including both military and civilian dispensations, in Pakistan have initiated a host of tax reforms in the past. However, none of them have been matured enough to optimise the state’s fiscal space and mobilisation of resources for the needy sections of society.
Many of such reforms were virtually found biased against the poor and failed to install a system of progressive taxation that is the mainstay for a majority of the developed and non-developed nations, which typically creates fiscal space through direct taxation.
A modern nation-state, which has squarely based its legitimacy on popular support, justifies its existence through dispensing multifaceted functions ranging from providing security to the people and care for the welfare of the needy, which is on the subsistence level and unable to sustain independently.
During the 20th century, a majority of statesmen among democracies agreed on the rationale of a progressive taxation mechanism to facilitate the underdogs of society, who otherwise have not enough space to ensure their financial solvency, but are a stakeholder in the general economic growth.
Those poor, popularly called by the leftists as have-nots, have very little potential to compete in the competitive-cum-capitalistic market. The financial strains they face in such a preordained structural distribution of economic power cannot be surpassed instantly with any structural intervention.
In such a situation, the poor sections of society are inclined towards the right, particularly at the time of elections, keeping in view its political and economic optimisation that would brought them at par with the privileged and powerful sections, where they would not feel being exploited and humiliated.
Such a consciousness produces a responsible, vigilant and dedicated leadership, always conscious of being accountable to the people. They always look forward to devising such policies and implementing such mechanisms that provide relief, welfare and reward to cater for the demand of the majority.
Initially, such a public good model was loathsome when political leaders used to act like bosses. The electorate was only obliged to keep a noticeable presence before their political bosses, who were supposed to provide them all benefits individually ranging from jobs, security from the system, and settlement in cities at the cost of welfare for the majority.
It was a practice that was in vogue in the United States in the last decades of the 19th century. However, those political bosses and political machines could not prove effective in the face of popular demand for progressive reforms, which triggered a popular political movement from 1890 to 1917, hailed by the reformer who is known in the annals of American history as Muckraker.
That marked a watershed in American history where a new polity with collective responsibility to the majority emerged and a new set of reforms revolving around the welfare of the majority were introduced. It was only made possible by generating fiscal space by taxing the rich stratum of society.
Incremental taxation, progressive taxation, social security and pensions were made part of the governance model.
It is the progressive taxation that has helped societies to progress effectively while leaving no section of society behind – the regime of virtual equality, though psychologically, which has got effectively placed in the democratic governance models.
A politician, who was traditionally a person with charismatic aura, has remained a story of the past. Now, he is judged while keeping in view the promises he makes and the policies he pursues and whether he abides by the commitments made at the time of elections.
However, the nation, which has just got freedom from the colonial yoke, has its own set of problems where people expect to be delivered advanced facilities without being taxed in equal proportion.
The absence of egalitarian sensibility poses a lot of challenges to the politics of such nations where politicians are obliged to act like bosses who are supposed to deliver everything to their electorate. Therefore, the direct and progressive taxation regime is a nemesis for the politicians.
Pakistan is among those nations intermittently facing a fiscal crisis, which requires aid from friendly nations, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other international financial institutions.
Currently, Pakistan is in the middle of such a crisis and things have taken a turn towards the worst in the backdrop of ongoing dialogue with the IMF which is intent on imposing such conditions that will place a heavy cost on the government.
The lender wants to push Pakistani leadership to the path of progressive taxation by imposing more taxes on the wealthy while providing protection and relief to the poor.
IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has said, “What we are asking for are steps Pakistan needs to take to be able to function as a country and not to get into a dangerous place where its debt needs to be restructured.”
She stressed that in the case of Pakistan, the public and private sectors should come forward and contribute to the economy. Subsidies must be disbursed on a need basis and not to everyone. Such subsidies must help alleviate the problems of poor sections. She acknowledged that Pakistan is facing an acute economic crisis.
However, such tax suggestions may pose a humongous problem to most of the political leaders that have to face the masses in the coming elections.

1,ICT exports to help in redemption from crisis,It is essential govt encourages investment by facilitating ICT entrepreneurs,"Pakistan is facing its worst economic challenges in recent memory. The foreign exchange reserves held by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) are hovering around the $4 billion mark as some impetus has been provided in recent weeks with the inflow of funds from China.
As reported by the SBP, the current account deficit was at $17.4 billion in FY22 and at $500 million in February 2022. This has decreased to $74 million in February 2023.
Correspondingly, the current account deficit in the first eight months of FY23 is almost at 1/3rd of the value reported during the same time period of the previous fiscal year. Export receipts and import payments have both reported a decline, with the latter declining at a faster rate.
The decline in imports is not only likely due to the several measures taken by the government to limit imports, such as the delay in opening of letters of credit (LCs) of the importers, but also likely due to the decrease in economic activities.
Similarly, exporters too, have reported constraints due to shortages of imported inputs and the fall in the capacity utilisation of the manufacturing sector. The uncertainty in economic conditions and the inability of the government to solve the issues as it delays its agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has created several challenges, especially on the balance of payment (BoP) front.
According to data of the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), exports of goods in the first eight months of FY23 is 9% lower than the value reported in the same period of the previous fiscal year. The lack of exports has exacerbated economic conditions as Pakistan finds itself in the midst of another BoP crisis. One silver lining in recent years was the trend of the exports of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) services.
According to the data extracted from ITC’s Trademap.org, exports of ICT services was at $2.45 billion in 2021. It had never crossed the $2 billion mark previously. It breached the $1 billion mark in 2017.
The exports had more than doubled in the last five years, which was due to significant investments in the sector.
The total exports of services from Pakistan stood at $6.5 billion in 2021. Imports of services were reported at $9.8 billion in 2021, creating a deficit of approximately $3.3 billion in the trade of services.
Interestingly, the deficit was more than $5.4 billion in 2017 and 2018, largely driven by transport and travel services.
The ICT services reported a surplus of more than $600 million in 2021, which makes its contribution as important as the contribution made by leather goods exporters. The recent years have proven the importance of the ICT sector in generating the needed dollar revenues for Pakistan. This sector can aid its escape from the vicious cycle involving a recurring BoP crisis.
Developing a viable ICT sector not only requires massive investment in communication infrastructure and in appropriate educational and training facilities, but also easier access to technologies such as computer hardware, software and mobile phones. According to the Digital Development Dashboard published by the International Telecommunication Union in 2022, 33% of the population in Pakistan has access to internet at home, while 12% of the households own a computer at home. Around 46% of the population owns a mobile phone with 82 of 100 inhabitants subscribed to a mobile network.
There are almost three million fixed broadband subscribers, a majority of them accessing the internet between the speeds of 2 to 10 Mbit per second.
In comparison, 24% of the population in India has access to internet at home and 11% of the households own a computer.
However, India has about 27.5 million fixed broadband subscribers, with more than 90% accessing it at speed greater than 10Mbit per second. Considering India’s success as an ICT export powerhouse, Pakistan must improve the quality of fixed broadband infrastructure. Although, the price to access internet through various medium in the US dollar terms in Pakistan is one of the cheapest, the price of the fixed broadband basket of 5GB is one of the highest relative to GNI per capita.
A 5GB fixed broadband basket is about 15.7% of GNI in Pakistan, compared to 3.3% in India. The cost of fixed broadband in Pakistan is much above the affordability target of 2%, making the provision of high-speed internet to households relatively expensive. The Digital Trade Restrictiveness Index published by the European Centre for International Political Economy (ECIPE) in 2018 ranks Pakistan as one of the most restrictive economies in terms of the applied tariffs on the imports of ICT goods.
Pakistan is also not a signatory to the World Trade Organisation’s (WTO) Information Technology Agreement. Accession to it would require elimination of customs duties on MFN basis for specified electronic goods.
Interestingly, Pakistan is ranked one of the most liberal countries in terms of the restrictions of foreign investment in the ICT sector. However, the protectionist policies on the imports of electronic goods, is unlikely to encourage foreign efficiency-seeking investment in this sector.
In addition, Pakistan has imposed measures involving content moderation regulations, data protection regulations and localisation requirements which can be overburdening for potential investors such that it deters new investments in the sector. For instance, a popular platform was repeatedly blocked by regulators in recent years, which suggests lack of clear and transparent policies to investors.
In essence, there is significant benefit to attain from the development of the ICT sector. The rise in exports in recent years highlights its importance to the economy, particularly as Pakistan faces severe challenges on its external economic front.
It is essential that the government encourages investment by facilitating ICT entrepreneurs to realise their potential.

2,Pakistan’s oily disposition,It’s real reason of potential default as govt needs dollars for oil imports,"Only last year when everyone was worried about the current account deficit, the Policy Research Institute of Market Economy noted that the root of the problem lay within the fiscal deficit and not the import of luxury items as usually blamed.
Hardly 10% of Pakistan’s imports can be considered non-essential from a public perspective.
At present, several scholars have come to agree that the fiscal deficit is exerting pressure on the current account. It was never the entire economy of the country, which was running out of dollars, it was just the government. And why would the government of Pakistan need dollars, you may ask?
Everyone likes to blame the economic pressure on the government on military spending or high interest payments on external debt. But the real answer is Pakistan State Oil (PSO). PSO is going bankrupt. It does not have money to import oil.
On March 21, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet approved a grant of $100 million to help PSO through its financial crunch. This was in response to a formal “SOS call” after a technical default.
The grant is meant to abate the repercussions, but for how long? A few days prior to this, PSO had asked the Finance Division to introduce a new petroleum levy of Rs10 per litre to help it through the financial mess.
In addition, in order to enable PSO to remain afloat in its payment obligations to LNG suppliers and to continue the LNG supply chain, the ECC has allowed a sovereign guarantee in favour of SNGPL for commercial borrowing of Rs50 billion on an immediate basis.
PSO’s receivables have now reached the level of Rs762 billion since June 30, 2022. Receivables from SNGPL currently stand at Rs494 billion.
SNGPL is another state-owned enterprise which has failed to function sustainably despite timely payments by its residential, commercial and industrial consumers. This is despite the fact that when the government must prioritise the opening of LCs, PSO comes first and then everyone else. It all falls upon the consumer, as usual.
PSO had a monopoly over oil imports all the way from 1974 till 2000. Since then, from a share of 100% of imports, PSO now imports approximately 65% of the total.
Its share in consumer markets has been constantly falling despite having the largest marketing and distribution network in the industry.
So what happens when I want to buy oil? I go to someone who has it. Where do they get their oil from? They buy it in the international oil market using their own dollar reserves.
So what happens when I want to buy oil in Pakistan? I go to someone who has it 65% of the time, that someone will be PSO.
PSO imports oil using dollars from the government of Pakistan. And then we are surprised when the government runs out of dollars. Despite reducing the current account deficit by banning or discouraging most types of imports, the country is still at risk of default.
There is more to it. Oil is the government’s leading source of indigenous revenue. This is basically how the government converts a portion of its foreign exchange reserves into tax revenues in PKR. What happens here?
While this may not be corruption in the traditional sense, it signals that the rules governing this industry have become corrupted. The state and state-run corporations are running a mutually rewarding scheme at the cost of general welfare.
The public sector is a bottomless pit, as it can consume all resources put into it. We must understand that organisations without a profit motive will never be geared towards efficiency, and they will always waste their money.
If there is excess cash, the government will hire temporary employees that the court will never allow to become redundant. If there is a large amount of time to perform a simple task, the government will increase the complexity of the task to fill the time.
Governments with so much involvement in economics would go bankrupt from sustainability issues.
You see, Pakistan’s biggest threat from default has nothing to do with us running out of food. We grow basic food crops which can help us sustain ourselves on our own.
But if we can’t import oil, we won’t be able to run our transportation, industrial, energy or household sectors. The whole economy will come to a grinding halt. And we would have to say goodbye to our modern way of living.
We would still survive, but the point is, is this any way to live? And more importantly, is this any way to run a government?

3,Who cares about the economy in this political tug of war?,Perhaps average age of policymakers needs to come down from 70s to 40s,"The dollar rate is now a religious hymn, with everyone from rags to riches quoting it. A country’s currency is one of the key reflections of its economic strength or lack thereof. Chatters and doomsday predictions of Pakistan’s economic default or bankruptcy have invariably put pressure on the Pak rupee.
However, the depreciation – euphemistically, “market determined adjustments” – hasn’t solved problems either. Ironically, without having to declare default of global bond payments, why did the rupee fall more than Sri Lanka’s currency? One that has already defaulted.
As any market determined by buyers and sellers, the more people want your currency the stronger it is and vice versa. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist nowadays to understand that as a functioning economy, you want dollar inflows to be greater than dollar outflows.
Minor outflows are liveable, provided they are for productive uses only. Pakistan’s predicament of low exports to feed population needs of 240m is common knowledge with obvious solutions. In the last five years, Sri Lanka’s rupee has depreciated 106% against the US dollar to 321/$ while Pakistan’s currency has fallen by 164% to Rs283/$. Even on a 15-year comparison, Sri Lanka’s rupee has fallen 204% against the dollar compared to Pakistan’s dismal plunge of 356%. The more our depreciation, the deeper our quagmire. Senior economist and academics still advocate such currency adjustments in their blue prints as it is probably a one-way easy bet.
They are not, however, prescribing the right medicines. It’s time to embrace the fact that currency adjustments have compounded problems instead of solving them. We must acknowledge that our imports as a % of GDP at 15-17% are not the problem. In fact, the ratio of imports per capita is one of the lowest in the world, even in comparison with Bangladesh, India, Egypt, Philippine etc.
Nigeria is the only similar sized country with nearly equal imports per capita. Their oil-heavy export revenues, however, keep their economy afloat while Pakistan is a beneficiary of brain drain (remittances). The Egyptian pound and Turkish Lira are other currencies depreciating more than the Pak Rupee but haven’t defaulted. Nevertheless, as tourist hubs with exportable surplus, their dollar revenues have increased. Double digit annual currency depreciation has socio-economic costs. Businesses find it impossible to forecast and expand production while repeated monetary tightening cycles to arrest dollar outflows reduce industrial profits and competitiveness.
While other countries subsidise exports and import reducing manufacturing, we are forced to reverse good and bad subsidies both to ensure fiscal discipline. The only result is rising unemployment amidst perpetual despair and stagflation. Talented people are hired by global markets while industrialists park money in defensive fixed income products and less productive real-estate assets.
The boom-and-bust cycle is repeated after a few years due to external favourable factors and marginal increase in remittances as labour gets exported. For the next few years, Pakistan needs a steady currency with marginal depreciation of 3-4% per year but the focus of policy makers is only and only on growing exports with fewer dollar inputs, such as technology exports.
In fiscal year 2017, when the currency was stable near 105/$, the annual export of goods clocked in $22 billion. Six years later, with the rupee at 280/$ the exports are likely to marginally increase to $27-28 billion only. So, what exactly was the point of such adjustments as advocated by our esteemed policy makers, especially if we failed to grow the very exports we aimed to address.
Imports could have been curtailed by keeping interest rates at 13-14% throughout the cycle. The lives of hundreds of millions have become so miserable that hatred for policy makers and hopelessness has increased. There is a growing class of youth now becoming fed up with the political tug of war. Constant bickering between politicians, the establishment and judiciary has rendered the country without guardianship.
Those calling the shots have seen their net worth increase over decades – though they wouldn’t deserve white collar jobs abroad – while scores of bright, talented and full-of-potential brains are finding odd jobs, remaining unemployed, being underpaid and captaining Careems/Ubers.
The system may not change. Whether the elections take place this month or in August, the faces are likely to be the same with the same mundane, old fashioned and copycat policies. These people living in posh houses with multi-million-dollars’ worth of wealth cannot possibly feel the problems of 220 million people. Optimists willing to change the system either become part of the system or die trying. Systematic disfranchising of people under the democratic set up where votes are casted on tribal, ethnic, linguistic and religious grounds can never bring a grass root leader to the top.
No wonder many people leave the country behind to seek – and get – meritorious placements abroad. Economists and policy makers should stop the myopic focus on currency depreciation to lift exports. A lot more is needed and is possible.
Scotland is being led by a 37-year-old second-generation Pakistani. Perhaps the average age of policy makers needs to come down from 70s to 40s. Suo moto anyone?

4,Why don’t people pay taxes?,Pakistan is a country where ratio of taxes to size of economy remains quite low,"Taxes are levied through law and every citizen of the country is supposed to be a law-abiding citizen. However, Pakistan is one of the countries where the ratio of taxes to the size of economy remains quite low.
In fact, it is far lower than the spending ambitions and obligations of its federal and provincial governments.
One can always come up with an array of popular but evasive arguments, like lack of trust in the government; corruption and misuse in expenditure of public money; and tax agencies’ connivance with tax evaders. Yet, so many countries with a worse track record, on all these counts, are able to collect much more taxes.
In an ideal world, citizens expect an honest government and tax institutions, but in the real world, governments and their tax authorities are seldom likeable entities.
The problem is that compliance with tax laws and payment of taxes is quite counter-intuitive in essence. The human brain is trained to make trade-offs, that is, giving away something only on getting something of equal or greater utility in return.
Taxes on the other hand are not linked with any exchange or reward, in the short, medium or long term. As often, the beneficiaries of tax payments are sets of people, different and remote from those paying the taxes.
So, in a rational world, nobody would like to pay taxes, unless forced to. Let’s for a minute assume that an individual is patriotic and understands the national importance of paying taxes, and wants to be completely honest with the government in tax returns. If such a person is a salaried individual or is receiving passive incomes such as rents, dividends or interest incomes, such honesty is possible.
But in case of traders or manufacturers of non-branded goods, such honesty can grievously harm their business, if their competitors are not paying their taxes honestly.
The objective of the argument is not to condone non-payment of due taxes, but one needs to understand the rationality and logic behind non-declaration or under-declaration of revenues by the otherwise honest persons.
Let’s say in a tyre trading market, there are 50 shops selling car tyres. Two of these shops are registered as sales tax filers. If the cost of one tyre to all shopkeepers is Rs8,500 and each of them wants to earn a profit of Rs1,500, the sale price of tyre will be Rs10,000.
The sales tax-registered shopkeeper will have to sell it at Rs11,800 because of 18% sales tax whereas the non-registered ones can sell it at Rs10,500 (if the cost of evading registration and filing is assumed at Rs500).
As a result, the ones registered with sales tax authorities will be forced to close down, unless they start under-reporting by suppressing sales or by buying flying input invoices, to the point where their selling price becomes at par with that of the tax-evading shopkeepers.
That is precisely the reason why the deepening of tax base is not possible without sufficient broadening, so as to establish horizontal equity, without which no tax enforcement can work.
The other dilemma in tax compliance is that a rational person would always like to minimise his tax payments, as the utility of money in possession is far greater than giving it to the government for a largely undetermined purpose (at least not determined by the taxpayer directly).
This paradox was elaborated by two economists namely Michael G Allingham and Agnar Sandmo in their 1972 seminal paper titled “Income tax evasion: a theoretical analysis.”
In this paper, they discuss the choice of a taxpayer who rationally trades off the benefits from evading taxes and the risk of costs from detection and incurring fines. It was argued that by increasing the perception of an increased probability of being caught (for evading taxes) and the magnitude and certainty of suffering penalties, tax authorities can deter evasion.
If we accept the robustness of this famous A-S Model of tax compliance, we can safely say that the tax authorities in Pakistan have not been successful in creating a perception in the minds of potential and actual taxpayers that paying taxes correctly now is far cheaper and painless than paying later, when their tax evasion stands detected.
The authorities have also not been able to create the perception that the probability of being caught, if one is not honest in compliance, is close to certainty.
According to available data, there are, in Pakistan, 160 million mobile phone users, 85 million bank accounts (67 million active bank accounts), at least 5 million private vehicles on roads, 350,000 industrial electricity connections and 4 million commercial electricity consumers, while the income tax filing population is 3.5 million (one-third filing zero income returns) and sales tax payers/ depositors are 60,000.
This is the perfect picture of an extreme horizontal inequity, which forces the people, who are filers/ payers, not to declare their revenues and incomes, correctly. The horizontal equity can be restored only if their competitors also comply.
This leads us to another interesting point. If the tax administration is not so effective, then why and how is it expected to collect almost Rs7.5 trillion in this financial year?
This is so because, luckily, an elaborate system of withholding taxes and tax collection on formal imports (customs duty, sales tax and income tax) is going to contribute about Rs5.5 trillion this year and most of the balance amount will be contributed by large corporates in the form of advance income tax and domestic sales tax.
This system has evolved as a result of our peculiar political economy and reluctance of allocating reasonable resources to the FBR. The system, though partially effective, is not encouraging tax base broadening or deepening because of the lack of horizontal equity and deterrence.
Moreover, compliance has become dependent on ad hoc tax deductions at various points of value chain, and the documented large-scale manufacturing sector.
The ineffectiveness of voluntary compliance by individuals and firms, on the other hand, is obvious from the fact that only Rs75 billion, out of this year’s annual target of Rs7,500 billion, that is, only 1%, represents the return payment.
So unless the tax authorities bring most of the liable persons within the folds of tax-paying population (horizontal equity) and successfully create a perception of a very high probability of being caught if not reporting correctly, with almost certain punitive consequences (effective deterrence), the potential and existing taxpayers are not going to pay their correct due taxes.
The matter of making procedures taxpayer-friendly and facilitation of taxpayers can come later, only after the fulfilment of these two primary and more important pre-requisites of horizontal equity and effective deterrence.
