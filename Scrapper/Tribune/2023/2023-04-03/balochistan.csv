0,Stone-crushing plants openly defy court orders,Locals say plants causing respiratory diseases and pollution,"Locals of Suraj Gali and adjacent areas said that stone-crushing plants in the area continue to operate in violation of the Supreme Court’s order.
They said that the court orders for the closure of the crushing plant have been ignored by owners, who continue to operate with the alleged backing of local district officials.
Earlier, a three-member commission appointed by the Supreme Court for the prevention of illegal stone crushing visited a plant set up in the suburbs of Suraj Gali. The commission issued instructions to reduce the blasting to a minimum level, it keeping in mind the sufferings of the local population caused by heavy blasting and dust.
Local sources said that during the visit, the commission members said that the Suraj Gully area was where dozens of crush plants existed. It has been proposed to change the one-kilometer rules around the crushing plant. The commission said that the first lease of the land has been asked to be limited to the allotment so that no more crushing plants can be built in the area. The commission issued a warning to the crushing plant owners for heavy blasting. A few days ago, due to the heavy blasting at the crushing plant, stones fell in the fields and houses, the locals said.
The commission has issued strict instructions to completely desist from life-threatening heavy blasting.
A local farmer complained to the commission members that for the past several years, the poisonous water of a crushing plant has been seeping into his field, which was damaging his crop.
Meanwhile, a large number of locals of several areas including Dera Khanpur, Pind Gujran, Rani Wah and other areas staged a protest and blocked the road and as a result, the commission members remained stuck in the middle of the road for hours.
The protesters were carrying placards and banners in their hands. They raised slogans against the crushing plant mafia.
Sources said that the crushing plats openly violate the orders of the Supreme Court and carry out heavy blasting, which results in large flying stones falling on houses of adjoining communities.
According to sources, the heavy stones flying from the blasting also hit the pole of the main transmission line of 11000kv, causing a pole to fall and the main heavy wires to break. The electricity in the area could not be restored for 12 hours due and the citizens faced difficulties.
The sources said that the district administration and related departments were helpless in influential crushing plant owners. The sources said that no department can dare to implement the court orders and the commission.

3,Hordes of beggars descend on markets,Alms seekers turn city’s busiest locations into begging dens,"With the arrival of the holy month of Ramazan, a large number of professional beggars and alms seekers have appeared in the busiest commercial centres and bazaars of private housing societies in the federal capital, causing an undue nuisance for the residents.
As being witnessed, an unusual number of beggars including women, children, labourers and eunuchs of all ages have completely taken over the pedestrian paths and roads in housing societies like PWD, Police Foundation, CBR and Pakistan Town, hampering and disturbing the usual flow of traffic and business activities.
Thanks to the lukewarm response of the relevant authorities, the residents said, these alms seekers and labourers have turned these areas into begging dens.
In every nook and cranny of the main commercial centres of PWD and Police Foundation, you have to face different begging figures of all shades with stretched hands and weeping grimaces, Anwar Sheikh, a cloth merchant said.
“This is unprecedented as we have been living in the area for the last fifteen years but had never witnessed such unpleasant sights as hordes of beggars swarm every part. You can’t go with peace of mind to purchase Iftari or Sehri items from different eateries located in PWD and Police Foundation,” Zarminay Gul Pasha, an apparent jittery woman at a famous bakery opined.
“It is now difficult to discern between a professional and deserving alms seeker,” she added hastily.
Muhammad Farooq, a photojournalist working with a foreign news wire and resident of Media Town, shared that besides, these professional beggars, a considerable number of labourers who could not find work, resort to begging, turning the main entrance and intersections of roads in these societies into their ideal dens and constantly perturbing the residents.
The main U-turn near the National Bank and Tandoori restaurant in Police Foundation had turned into a no-go area for the residents and visitors due to the presence of a huge number of beggars and labourers, he added.
Muhammad Akbar, another resident of CBR Town, said that a shanty settlement has propped up in the society in which a large number of families, particularly from southern Punjab, had been accommodated on a rental basis by some individuals on their private land.
“Children and females regularly beg while the males sit near roundabouts and U-turns on the main roads to fetch meals and foods from the alms distributors,” he added.
Other residents complained that authorities have been turning a blind eye to such an unchecked and illegal settlement which could give rise to different crimes imperilling the lives of the residents.
The residents have demanded of the authorities concerned immediately launch a continuous and relentless drive in different sectors of Islamabad to rid the areas of beggary.

4,Closure of road: HIA threatens to take to streets,Locals hail district admin’s decision of closing artery for heavy vehicles,"Industrialists of Hattar have announced to take to the streets in protest against the closure of Khanpur Taxila road for heavy traffic during the day timing.
After an emergency meeting of Hattar Industrialists Association (HIA) Haripur under the chair of Malik Ashiq Awan, the industrialists unanimously agreed to take to the streets in protest against the closure of the Khanpur-Taxila main road.
They said that currently there were around 400 industrial establishments in Hattar Industrial Estate where not only thousands of people were employed but also billions of rupees of revenues were collected from them annually.
They said that the industry in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) was suffering from severe difficulties and many units had already been closed and the government was losing billions of rupees in taxes. They said that the closure of the industry was rendering thousands of people jobless.
They said that in such a difficult situation, the assistant commissioner of Taxila has issued an order to close down the main road from 5 am to 10 pm, which is completely unfair. The industrialists said that due to the closure of the road, it was increasingly becoming difficult to deliver manufactured goods from factories to various parts of K-P, Taxila, Rawalpindi, Islamabad and Punjab, which was causing further losses to the industries.
They said that if one of the two roads was not opened, Hattar industrial owners and thousands of factory workers will stage a strong protest against the road closure in Khanpur and Taxila.
A well-known manufacturer of Hattar Tayyab Khan Swati said that the assistant commissioner issued the notification two days ago to stop heavy traffic, due to which hundreds of vehicles had to move out of Taxila city.
He said that owners and drivers of heavy vehicles were also facing difficulties. “There is also a risk of theft and looting from vehicles.”
He said that this action on the part of the assistant commissioner was equivalent to the economic killing of workers. “When the raw material does not reach the factories on time, how will the labourer work and how will the production be prepared and supplied on time? Several such problems are emerging which can have disastrous consequences.
The industry is already suffering from an economic crisis. The industrialists are burdened by heavy taxes. With complete opposition to this move, we will decide the future course of action soon,” he said.
HIA President Malik Ashiq Awan said that such an order was issued last year as well but it was suspended after their strong protest
He said that the biggest plants of the country and many other big factories were located in Hattar and if the production could not be ready on time, the products will disappear from the market across Pakistan. He asked the prime minister and Punjab chief secretary to take notice of the issue.
Meanwhile, according to the Taxila district administration, the notification has been issued to prevent problems arising from heavy traffic.
“The time allowed for heavy traffic is from 10 pm to 6 am. Heavy traffic timings have been fixed in consultation with others,” the administration said adding that citizens, patients and shopkeepers were also facing difficulties due to traffic jams jam for hours.
The administration said that several complaints were being received from the citizens of Taxila regarding the problems caused by heavy traffic. Keeping in view the public interest, the entry of heavy traffic has been prohibited during working hours, the administration said.
Taxila's well-known social worker Syed Hyder Ali Shah said that the people of Taxila appreciate the Taxila administration for the move and a long-standing demand of the people has been fulfilled.
He said that people had been suffering from various diseases due to the acrid dust and pollution caused by heavy vehicles. He said that work on the alternate road has resumed and the heavy vehicles will have a separate road.
Provincial Assembly candidate of Jamaat-e-Islami Taxila Atiqur Rehman Kashmiri also led a delegation and held a meeting with the Taxila assistant commissioner.

8,Integrated immunisation drive kicks off,Children under two years of age to be inoculated against 12 diseases,"A month-long immunisation drive kicked off in the Rawalpindi district to inoculate children under two years of age against 12 different diseases.
According to official sources, the drive that began on April 1 will conclude on April 30.
They said children who were unavailable during the last anti-polio campaign will also be administered polio vaccines.
Moreover, expecting mothers will also be vaccinated against various diseases.
Sources said altogether, around 188 teams have been formed for the same number of union councils across the district to protect children from diseases including tuberculosis, diphtheria, measles, whooping cough, cholera, malaria, and TB.
A team will consist of a vaccinator and a social mobiliser who will go door-to-door to execute the plan.
World Health Organisation and the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund have extended support to the district health authority to carry out the Integrated Outreach Activity at the town and district levels.
According to vaccination supervisor Chaudhry Muhammad Hussain, the duration of the drive has been stretched to a month keeping the importance of the Integrated Outreach Activity in mind.
During this campaign, children who have not been given vaccines as per the schedule will also be immunised by checking their cards.
Meanwhile, health experts have said that due to the lack of timely immunisation of children under the age of two years, a large number of young children are landing in various hospitals with diseases that can easily be defeated through vaccines. They also said expecting mothers are giving birth to emaciated and sick children due to the lack of proper vaccinations and nutritious food.
