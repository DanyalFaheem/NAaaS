0,Animal rights activists seek camel-ride ban,Reports of Deachi Express camel being abused surface,"Animal rights NGOs have called for a ban on the use of camels for rides on Mall Road after footage obtained by Express News allegedly showed a camel used in the Deachi Express service being kept in a dirty environment and not being provided with proper food.
The Deachi Express service was introduced as part of the Dilkash Lahore program in 2013 to provide entertainment for citizens.
The video reportedly shows the camel being kept in a dirty environment with garbage strewn around and appearing thin and weak. The NGOs argue that using camels, which are desert animals, in front of a buggy-like vehicle on a paved road is cruel to the animal.
However, Punjab wildlife authorities have claimed that as camels are not classified as wildlife, they cannot take any action.

Meanwhile, the Anti-Cruelty to Animals Department has been urged to shut down Deachi Express, which was initiated by the then DCO in 2013.
The contract for the Deachi Express service was awarded to a private contractor who offers rides to children and families from Town Hall to Chairing Cross.

1,"Two young girls sold, gang raped",Multiple incidents of sexual assault have been reported in Dijkot,"Several women were allegedly subjected to sexual assault, while one young girl managed to thwart an attempted rape by raising an alarm.
A resident of Sumandri Road in the Bansan area of Police Station D-type Colony, reported to the police that six years ago, eight men including Shehanshah, Dilawar Shah, Dilbar Shah, Muhammad Ilyas, and Muhammad Saeed abducted her and her family, taking them to Toba Tek Singh where they were forced to work in a buffalo shed. Nine months ago, two of her daughters were sold to Dilawar Shah and Dilbar Shah for Rs550,000, where they were sexually assaulted by Ilyas and Muhammad Saeed.
In a separate incident, a 22-year-old resident of Medina Town was raped by the accused Danish Masih and Jinio Daniyal.
Another woman was sexually assaulted by Adnan when he found her alone in her house in New Green Town on Sargodha Road.
Additionally, a resident of 108 GB, managed to fend off a rape attempt by making noise when Azhar and others tried to assault her.
Police have registered separate cases against each of the accused and launched raids to bring them to justice.
A couple of days ago in Dijkot, a woman had been gang-raped by two men in her home, while the rape attempts were foiled by two young girls who raised the alarm.
The incident occurred when the victim was alone at home, and the attackers, identified as Muneer Ahmed and an accomplice, forcibly entered the house and committed the heinous crime.
In separate incidents, several individuals attempted to sexually assault two young girls, who live in different parts of the city.
In both cases, the girls managed to foil the attempts by making noise and alerting others.
The police have registered cases for all three incidents and have launched a manhunt to apprehend the perpetrators.
On March 22, a young girl was gang-raped in Abdullahpur by five people who abducted her and threatened to release a video of her on social media.
The victim’s mother, a resident of Abdullahpur, registered a case with the police after her daughter was abducted while on her way to purchase groceries.

3,Missing law enforcement : Unregulated drug sales imperil lives,"Illegal pharmacies, uncertified dispensers working with impunity","As the meagerness of the public healthcare system continues, the citywide operation of unlicensed drug stores in the heart of Punjab places the lives of citizens on thin ice.
While the paucity of basic health services has already reduced the quality of life of the average citizen, the unregulated sale of drugs by unregistered pharmacies and poorly trained chemists, who disregard both the qualifying credentials and standard preservation requirements necessary for the storage and sale of medications, has brought the treatment prospects of patients down in flames.
“I regularly require fixed doses of blood thinners and beta blockers. However, most of the pharmacies that I frequent either make errors in determining the correct dosage of my medicines or store the medicines in unsuitable conditions, thereby reducing the efficacy of my treatment,” complained Zaman Khan, who suffers from a cardiac ailment.
As per sources privy to the matter, despite the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) clearly mandating the maintenance of optimal environmental conditions for the proper storage of medications, a large number of pharmacies keep drugs at substandard temperatures which denatures their molecules, thereby diminishing their potency.
Apart from the wide unavailability of temperature-controlled medicine storage cabinets, many drug stores also have unqualified personnel selling medications to patients, despite the law requiring the possession of a five-year degree by a pharmacist, and a two-year degree by medical store staff.
Similar to their differing qualifying credentials, medical stores and pharmacies also hold different licences which specify the category of drugs that each may sell. Where medical stores are expected to limit their products to over the counter (OTC) drugs like analgesics and antipyretics, pharmacies have the rights to sell specific ailment targeting drugs, which are only to be made available if the patient holds a prescription from a verified physician.
However, sources reveal various medical stores illegally supply 145 different kinds of pharmacy reserved drugs, including steroids, cancer pills, high-potency antibiotics, antivirals and narcotics, to patients who do not even present a doctor’s prescription.
As Fazal Mehmood, a local, confirmed, “I have seen substance users purchasing prescription medications like morphine and narcotic shots easily from pharmacies. Nobody from the staff even bothers asking them for a doctor’s prescription.”
In addition to selling medicines without prescription, multiple drug stores are also reportedly running their businesses by selling counterfeit medications which are of a highly inferior quality and are rarely effective. To curb a similar prevalence of counterfeit medications during the late 2000s, the Punjab Health Department had introduced the licensing system, which mandated all drug stores to officially register while penalising those who continued functioning without a licence.
Unfortunately, the licensing system has been largely unsuccessful in regulating the sale of medication in the province, believed to be home to the highest number of pharmacies in the country. Despite the designation of 154 drug inspectors and 6 drug courts specifically for the regulation of pharmacy laws, corruption in the ranks prevents serious action being taken against the lawbreakers.
In his response to the criticism pitted against the drug control officers, Director General of the Provincial Drug Control Unit Punjab, Muhammad Sohail highlighted the progress made by the drug inspectors in terms of the reasonable number of unlicensed drug stores that were caught and reported.
“While I agree that the pervasive problem of illegal drug sales is alarming, I also believe that the Drug Control Unit is working to the best of its abilities to curb the operation of unlicensed stores in a province as big as Punjab,” remarked Sohail while talking to The Express Tribune.

5,School year begins sans textbooks,Distribution of free books set to take weeks,"The new academic year has begun in the government schools of Punjab amid uncertainty about the provision of free textbooks to a large number of students.
According to sources in the provincial school education department, the production department of the Punjab Curriculum and Textbook Board was responsible to print the books by March 30 but now the process is unlikely to be competed in the coming two weeks.
The textbooks of Islamiyat, mathematics and general science had not been provided to thousands of students by the first day of the academic year on Saturday. The sources said the textbooks of grade seven and eight had not yet been delivered to the schools in the remote districts of the province.
They said delay in payment to some publishers was among the reasons of the current situation.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, a senior official of the Punjab School Education Department said, “Around 12 million students of the public sector schools had to be provided the textbooks free of charge. The department had advised the CEOs of all district education authorities to establish warehouses in collaboration with the district education officers.”
The warehouses had been set up and teachers assigned duties in all districts to distribute the free textbooks in the government schools. However, a large number of books have not been delivered to the warehouses so far.
“In some districts, the books of some subjects are not available. A shortage of the textbooks of general science, English and Islamiyat has been reported from several districts.
Any effort to streamline the process and look into the mismanagement has also not been observed ahead of the beginning of classes,” the official said.
An official of the textbook board said the tenders for publishing the books had been awarded but the authorities of the board had not come up with an explanation regarding the delay in their printing. He said the board was not in a position to provide the books to the schools in the coming two weeks.
“The books for the 7th and 8th class were sent last week for printing and their production will be delayed for around a month,” the official said and added that the students and teachers would have to spend the period without textbooks.
