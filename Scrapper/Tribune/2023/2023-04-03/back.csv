0,SC resumes election case hearing today,"Ruling coalition likely to raise objections to the bench, demand a full court","The Supreme Court will resume today [Monday] hearing of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s (PTI) petition against the postponement of polls in Punjab.
A three-judge bench led by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial will take up the case at 11:30 am.
Lawyers of the ruling coalition are expected to raise objections to the bench and reiterate their demand for the formation of a full court to decide the matter. In case the bench once again turns down the request, the ruling coalition will boycott the proceedings.
On Saturday, the ruling alliance held a meeting in which it expressed its lack of confidence in the three-judge bench comprising CJP Bandial, Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Muneeb Akhtar and decided not to accept any verdict issued by the bench.
After the meeting, the country’s top security czar said the incumbent coalition government might file references against the three Supreme Court judges.
“The possibility of filing references against the judges cannot be ruled out,” said Federal Minister for Interior Rana Sanaullah on Saturday while talking to Express News’ anchor Rehman Azhar.

1,"Abductors said ‘following Sana’s orders’, Mashwani tells LHC",PTI leader went missing ahead of party’s Minar-i-Pakistan rally on March 25,"The Lahore High Court was apprised by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf social media head Azhar Qazi Mashwani that the persons who abducted him said that they were carrying out the orders of Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah.
However, Justice Aalia Neelum disposed of two petitions wherein recovery of Azhar Mashwani and details of the FIRs had been sought.
As the proceedings commenced, Justice Neelum asked the law officer when the petitioner was released.
The police high-ups apprised the court that the petitioner did not visit the police station, adding that when they received information that he was released, they sent officials to meet him to know what had actually happened.
“Submit the police file,” Justice Neelum remarked.
The police high-ups apprised the court that the Investigation Officer of the case along with the police file was present in the magisterial court where the statement of the petitioner had yet to be recorded.
“How we can proceed further without the police file, Justice Neelum remarked.
Mashwani’s counsel Azhar Siddique apprised the court that it was the result of kind intervention of the court that today Mashwani was present in the courtroom.
Mashwani said, “The abductors introduced themselves as FIA officials and told him that all this is being done on the directions of PML-N’s Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah.”
Justice Neelum remarked, “You can record your version before the judicial magistrate.”
The court then disposed of the matter.
During the proceedings of another petition filed seeking details of the FIRs, the Punjab police high-ups and the FIA officials apprised the court that neither an FIR nor any inquiry was pending against Mashwani. The court disposed of the petition.
The PTI leaders had raised their voice against the abduction of Mashwani ahead of the party’s Minar-i-Pakistan rally on March 25. They had said that there was no trace of him at any police stations.

2,SJC asked to review SC judge’s ‘misconduct’,Two judges urge council to call meeting on matter of financial corruption,"Two senior judges of the Supreme Court and members of the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC), Justice Qazi Faiz Isa and Justice Sardar Tariq Masood, have written a judicial letter to the head and members of the Supreme Judicial Council to call a meeting to review the allegations of misconduct and financial corruption levelled against Justice Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi.
The letter was written to Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial, Chief Justice of Sindh High Court Justice Ahmed Ali M Sheikh and Chief Justice of Lahore High Court Justice Muhammad Ameer Bhatti.
The text of the letter stated that written complaints had been received from the Pakistan Bar Council and other petitioners against Justice Naqvi, alleging misconduct and financial corruption.
In the letter, it is said that by calling a meeting of the SJC, the allegations levelled against the judge should be reviewed if they were false or true. The Pakistan Bar Council sent a complaint against Justice Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi.
“Article 209 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan establishes the Supreme Judicial Council of Pakistan (‘the Constitution and ‘the Council respectively) and it is the duty of the Council to inquire into the capacity and misconduct of a judge.”
The letter stated, “Hon’ble Chief Justice, we are waiting for you to convene a meeting of the Council to consider the complaints and to ascertain whether there is substance in the stated allegations; we must exonerate the respondent Judge and fully restore his honour or else submit our report in terms of the Constitution. To leave the respondent Judge under a cloud of uncertainty undermines both his and Judiciary’s repute.”
The two judges said that a meeting should be called to determine whether the allegations against Justice Naqvi were true or false, if the allegations were false, the honour of the judge should be restored, if the allegations were true, action should be taken according to the Constitution.
According to the text of the letter, keeping the judge under the shadow of the accusations was affecting the honour of the judge and the judiciary. It was necessary to call a meeting of the SJC immediately to restore the independence of the judiciary and the public's trust in it.
The bar councils of the country had announced that they would file a complaint in the SJC against Justice Naqvi on the audio leak of former Punjab chief minister Pervaiz Elahi.
The Balochistan Bar Council and others had filed references against Justice Naqvi.

3,Shehbaz rules out change in Israel policy,PM says he had not imagined severity of country’s situation,"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday, rubbishing the social media propaganda, categorically ruled out any possibility of the relationship between Pakistan and Israel until the people of Palestine get their due right of a separate homeland.
Addressing the parliamentary party meeting of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), he resolved that Pakistan would not deviate from its principled position of having no ties with Israel until the Palestinians get their legitimate right.
He was referring to the social media posts mentioning any trade activity by a Pakistani Jew with Israel. ""There is not even mention of that. This is just baseless. An individual Jew has traded some goods. The government has nothing to do with that,"" he commented.
Behind such propaganda were the people who opposed a Muslim candidate of London Mayorship and instead supported the Jewish candidate, he added.
The prime minister told the PML-N parliamentarians that before assuming the government, he had not imagined the severity of the situation in form of a destroyed economy and strained foreign relations with brotherly countries, including China and Saudi Arabia.
He said under PML-N Quaid Muhammad Nawaz Sharif and with the cooperation of the allied parties, the government was making all-out efforts to cope with the challenges.
He said the government had fulfilled all the conditions imposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as the previous regime had violated the commitments with the global financial institution.
He said recently Pakistan was hit by the worst flood and the Federal Government alone had spent Rs100 billion to support the suffering people.
The prime minister recalled that during the tenure of Nawaz Sharif till 2017, the country was progressing with the sugar price at Rs 52 and the dollar rate at Rs 100.He said during its four-year tenure, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government took loans even more than those taken during the 70-year history.
The previous government not only violated the IMF agreement but also questioned the transparency in the CPEC (China-Pakistan Economic Corridor) projects which impacted the Pak-China bilateral relations. It was alleged that the CPEC projects involved 45 percent corruption and such allegations were repeated not only in the cabinet but also in the Parliament and private meetings, he added.

Prime Minister Shehbaz said the leadership of the PML-N and other allied parties rendered immense sacrifices and also put their politics at stake to protect the state which was in no way a bad deal.
""Though the situation is tough now, the time will come when it will change… Pakistan is genuinely at a crossroads. Today, we have to live within the ambit of the Constitution and law,"" he remarked.
The prime minister told the meeting that during the PTI government, there was no shortage of wheat in the country rather it was a scandal. However, the incumbent government timely imported the commodity to avert any shortage.
He said the government had launched the history's biggest project of distributing three wheat flour bags to needy families during Holy Ramazan which would benefit around 100 million people.
He said the government was striving to improve the situation but political stability was a must to achieve the desired goal.
Drawing a stark comparison, the prime minister said Nawaz Sharif's daughter was implicated in corruption cases but contrary to that the PTI wanted to save Imran Khan's wife claiming that she was not a public office-holder.

4,IHC seeks govt reply on Imran’s plea for security,LHC moved for removal of Imran as PTI chairman after disqualification,"The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday issued a notice to the interior ministry and the federal government, seeking a reply to a plea filed by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan for provision of security by April 6.
IHC Chief Justice Aamir Farooq heard Imran's plea which was filed following the “threatening” remarks made by Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah.
During the hearing, Justice Farooq inquired whether Imran was being provided security as a former prime minister. The PTI chief's lawyer, Advocate Faisal Farid, replied that Imran's security had been withdrawn.
Justice Farooq asked what the standard operating procedures (SOPs) were for provision of security in case someone received death threats.
He said former chief justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar had withdrawn many security details.
However, he added that the former CJP had also said that security could be provided if someone's life was in danger. ""Check if those SOPs are still in the field or not,"" Justice Farooq said.
Later, the court adjourned the hearing till April 6.
Toshakhana case
Separately, the IHC issued notices to the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), seeking replies over its investigation into the Toshakhana (gift depository) case while the matter remains sub judice.
The high court announced its reserved verdict over the maintainability of an application filed by Imran’s wife and former first lady Bushra Bibi challenging the summons notices issued by NAB.
Justice Farooq and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz presided over the hearing.

During the hearing, the petitioner's lawyer Khwaja Haris argued that the NAB notices contained incomplete information.
""The questionnaire seeks answers but the charges are yet to be detailed,"" he added, stressing that summons could only be issued once it had been clarified whether the concerned party was being ordered to appear as the accused or a witness.
He also said that the orders were issued just a day after former NAB chief Aftab Sultan resigned from his post who ""had revealed that there was pressure on him"".
Plea filed against Imran
An application has been filed in the Lahore High Court for the removal of Imran from the post of PTI chairman.
The application was filed by Muhammad Junaid, a citizen, through Advocate Afaq Ahmed.
The petitioner adopted the stance that the Election Commission of Pakistan had disqualified Imran from NA-95 Mianwali and after disqualification, no one could remain the head of a party.
“We approached the Election Commission but no action was taken on the request for Imran’s removal from the post of PTI chief.”
It was requested that an order be given for the removal Imran Khan from the post of PTI chairman..

7,Chinese debt trap ‘just a meme’: Ex-WB chief,"Lauds China for economic development, poverty alleviation","Dismissing the western allegations about China’s “debt-trap diplomacy”, former World Bank President Jim Yong Kim has said that the claims about Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) tricking nations into debt made no sense.
He made the remarks during the 2023 Boao Forum for Asia held last week under the theme “An Uncertain World: Solidarity and Cooperation for Development amid Challenges”.
The former WB president said studies have shown the term “debt-trap diplomacy” is ""nothing more than a meme"" and called on Asian Americans to stand up to the blind hate.
Citing American political scientist and professor of political economy at Johns Hopkins University Deborah Bräutigam, Kim said that the most effective and well-known researcher has not found any evidence to substantiate the claims made about the Chinese debt.
In fact, the term came about because of human negativity bias based on anxiety about the rise of China, he noted while quoting from the study.
""If there is one message we give to the Chinese people, it is please don't reduce your ambition to help other countries develop their economies and reduce poverty as you have over the last 30 years,"" he added.
Using the Gen-Z slang the acronym G.O.A.T (greatest of all time), the former WB bank president said that it was simply a historical fact that in terms of economic development and poverty alleviation, “China is the G.O.A.T, the greatest of all time… don’t let the rest of the world make you the scapegoat”.
Earlier, in another session themed ""Belt and Road: Sharing the Opportunities of Development,"" Jim Yong Kim, who is also the partner and vice chairman of Global Infrastructure Partners, called the BRI the most ambitious development project in human history and added that the essence of the initiative is to have a way of shoring up infrastructure foundation to let everyone aspire to enjoy a good life.
It may be noted that Kim’s comments came against the backdrop of western claims that Beijing was “inveigling” poorer countries into taking out loans to build expensive infrastructure only to eventually seize control of assets from borrowing nations.
However, despite the Asian giant’s recent measures to forgive interest-free loans, the experts noted that the US-led western block has claimed that the BRI is in fact a geopolitical strategy to establish Sinocentric world order.
According to Debt Justice, a UK-based campaigning organisation, just 12% of African governments’ external debt is owed to Chinese lenders compared to 35% owed to Western private lenders, according to the calculations based on World Bank data.
Furthermore, interest rates on private loans are almost double those on Chinese loans, while the most indebted countries are less likely to have their debt dominated by China.
Earlier, speaking during the session, the chairman of the Boao Forum for Asia and former secretary-general of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, said China's commitment to the multilateral approach and global partnership is reassuring and encouraging.
Emphasising peace and security as prerequisites for achieving sustainable development, Ban noted that “there is no decoupling of the two in any way”.
Zhao Fengtao, vice-chairman of the China International Development Cooperation Agency, said China has done an excellent job balancing development and security, achieving long-term stability and economic growth and setting an example for the rest of the world.
""It is a must to work harder to revitalize multilateralism and come together to tackle common challenges,"" he added, noting global crises require greater cooperation and partnership.
Andy Tsang Wai-hung, deputy director of China National Narcotics Control Commission, said the world must understand profound changes in the international arena can only be adapted to by working together.
""Only through a win-win approach can we rise to the challenges of the increasingly complicated global security landscape,"" he said.

8,"Landslides suspend traffic between Balochistan, K-P",Seven injured people have been shifted to nearby hospital,"Heavy landslides at the Koh-e-Sulaiman range due to the recent rains have suspended traffic between Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. However, no loss of life was reported.
A large part of N-50 National Highway (DI Khan to Kuchlak and Quetta) has been affected by the landslide at Balochistan’s Dhana Sar.
According to the Levies Force, seven people were injured in the incident and had been shifted to a nearby hospital. Moreover, four vehicles were also damaged in the incident.
On the instructions of Communications Minister Asad Mehmood, the National Highway Authority (NHA) field staff and machinery have been mobilised to remove the landslide debris from the road.
Communications Secretary and NHA Chairman Captain (retd) Muhammad Khurram Agha is in constant contact with NHA field officers in Balochistan and K-P.
Member of Balochistan Assembly Shahid Ehsanullah himself is supervising the restoration work, expressing hope that traffic will soon be restored.
At present, the NHA staff and machinery are active in removing the landslide debris from the road while more heavy machinery has been called from Zhob and Quetta.
The NHA staff has opened the road for light traffic while the affected road will be completely restored for all types of traffic within 24 to 30 hours.
NHA Balochistan North General Manager Agha Inayatullah has requested the commissioner and deputy commissioner to stop the traffic in Zhob and Saifullah, while the passengers travelling to K-P have been advised to take the alternative route N-70 National Highway (Qilla Saifullah-Multan) via Loralai and DG Khan.
The NHA has appealed to the travellers heading towards that direction to keep themselves informed about the weather conditions before travelling.
“The NHA is always ready to deal with all kinds of emergencies and is committed to providing the best road services to the nation.”
Meanwhile, the rescue officials said that the stormy weather was intensifying at the Sulaiman Mountains.
Flood alert
The Provincial Disaster Management Authority has issued a flood alert at the Koh-e-Sulaiman range.
Punjab PDMA Director General Imran Qureshi has asked the DG Khan, Rajanpur and Taunsa deputy commissioners to ensure timely reporting of the situation.
The PDMA spokesperson said a report on the damage caused by the recent rains was also sought.
“The deputy commissioners of the districts concerned should immediately activate the District Control Room for flood reporting and rescue operations,” the PDMA DG said. “Keep the relevant district rescue teams on alert. Timely rescue operations should be started in emergency situations.”
The district emergency operation centres of the respective districts, including the provincial control room, were fully operational 24/7, he added.
“The whole situation is being monitored from the provincial control room of the PDMA,” Qureshi added.
The PDMA spokesperson said citizens could seek assistance by calling PDMA's helpline 1129.

9,PML-N to craft response after face-off with CJP,PM calls party lawmakers’ huddle today; information minister says meeting will devise future strategy,"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has summoned an important meeting of parliamentary party of the PML-N on Monday (today) at the Parliament House to discuss the country’s political situation amid an ongoing tussle between the government and Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial.
The prime minister, who is also the PML-N president, has summoned the parliamentary party's meeting at 1pm to take its members into confidence on the decisions taken in the past few days and the current political volatility, which has been compounded by a severe financial crunch and constitutional breakdown.
Federal Information and Broadcasting Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said PM Shehbaz would preside over and address the meeting.
She added that the party members would consult and gauge the situation arising after the CJP turned down the government’s request to form a full court to hear the PTI’s plea against the delay in holding elections in Punjab within the constitutional limit of 90 days.
The information minister said the premier had called the huddle to learn about the party lawmakers’ opinion on the ongoing situation.
She continued that the participants of the meeting would also devise the future strategy of the party.
Aurangzeb said PM Shehbaz would attend the National Assembly session after the party meeting.
Although the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has delayed the elections in Punjab till October citing lack of funds and security, the government also wants polls after its constitutional term is completed in August this year.
However, the Supreme Court, while urging the political parties to lower the ‘toxic’ rhetoric, has been pushing the ECP to hold polls within the stipulated period of 90 days or a date closer to that.
The PTI has also been demanding polls in 90 days.
The PML-N’s parliamentary party meeting would be held just a day after PM Shehbaz consulted with the leaders of the ruling coalition.
Following the meeting, the coalition government expressed its lack of  confidence in the bench comprising the CJP, Justice Ijazul Ahsan, and Justice Muneeb Akhtar, hearing the case of the ECP’s delay in conducting elections in Punjab till October this year after initially announcing that it would hold the polls on April 30.
The ruling alliance demanded that the three-member bench should morally recuse itself from hearing the case and the CJP should hold a full court meeting to shun the impression of a “one-man show” in the apex court.
The meeting with the allied parties took place after the government attempted to clip the CJP’s powers to initiate suo motu proceedings and form benches on his own through a bill, which is now pending with President Arif Alvi for his approval to become law.
The meeting with PML-N lawmakers is taking place at a time when the top court’s bench is being disbanded and reconstituted on a regular basis in connection with the PTI’s petition against the postponement of the elections in Punjab province.
The nine-member bench has reduced to three and the government has also expressed no-trust in the current one, yet the CJP is adamant to hear the matter with the remaining two judges.
A key PML-N minister said the government would deliberate on the current political situation, upcoming elections in line with the ECP’s decision and SC proceedings as well as the role of the CJP and top court.
The minister added that the PML-N lawmakers would be informed about the party’s future strategy.
The coalition government has been accusing the superior judiciary of “bench-fixing” in crucial cases,; continuously giving “discriminatory” judgments; and handing out one interpretation of the Constitution to PTI chief Imran Khan, and another to the ruling alliance.
The PML-N-led federal government had been demanding the formation of a full court to decide the matter.
Some key leaders of the ruling party have openly criticised some senior judges, including the CJP, for their alleged impartiality.
