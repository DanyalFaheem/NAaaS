0,Politicians advised to mend fences to prevent economic meltdown,Business leaders urge both govt and opposition to mend bridges for sake of economy,"Pakistan's economy has partially shut down and millions of people have lost jobs due to continuous political instability. The nation is destined to encounter hyperinflation with the domestic currency likely plunging to Rs500 against the US dollar if the situation persists.
Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif also anticipated late last week that the local currency could slump to Rs500 against the greenback, if the political situation worsens.
Against this backdrop, business leaders demand that all stakeholders end the political deadlock, mend bridges and work towards political unity and stability in a bid to rescue, rehabilitate and revive the economy.
They said the coalition government should choose the path of reconciliation instead of a collision course and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) should also soften its tone in the greater national interest.
Ehsan Malik, the CEO of the Pakistan Business Council (PBC), a business advocacy forum of leading corporates and business groups, said the political instability has created a huge trust deficit between the world—including the International Monetary Fund (IMF)—and the country's political leadership, including both the government and the opposition, resulting in shutting down of the economy.
""The trust deficit is the main cause of all deficits like current account deficit and fiscal deficit,"" he said.
He said the situation has worsened to a level that people are dying in stampedes at wheat distribution outlets and charity handouts. ""This is a very serious situation. Forget about reviving the economy unless we have political unity in the country,"" he added.
He asked as to who will trust and fund a nation that stands divided. ""Pakistan is witnessing deep partisan political divisions. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court also seems divided. The divide must turn into unity.""
Malik said if the political situation continues to worsen, the economy will shut down completely. ""Fortunately or unfortunately, elections are a must to achieve political stability and let the economy stage a comeback. Politics is the art of compromise,"" he said
He advised the country's political leaders to tone down rhetoric; adopt reconciliatory politics and let the economy revive. He said PTI chief Imran Khan believes that the real stakeholders are in Rawalpindi. “That's why Khan says talking to the people in the government is meaningless.”
Malik said the political leadership should build a consensus for a charter of economy. The stakeholders must build consensus for increasing the number of taxpayers and addressing circular debt. The National Finance Commission (NFC) award also should be renegotiated.
Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) President Mohammad Tariq Yousuf asked politicians to return to the negotiation table in the greater national interest. ""The economy should lead politics instead of politics leading the economy,"" he said.
He warned that the economy may receive a serious setback at the end of the holy month of Ramazan and Eid Ul Adha if political instability continues.
""The little financing available in the economy due to people’s charity would vanish after Ramazan and the economy will face the worst crisis. It is high time for politicians to think about the economy and people and resolve issues through talks,"" he said.
""We need investment to fix the economy. Investors would not come back until political stability is ensured,"" he added.
Others said the full focus on politics and no time for economy has already resulted in inflation rising to 35.4% in March and the local currency depreciating by 54% to Rs284 against the US dollar.
If the political situation worsens and the IMF programme is not revived soon, the nation may encounter hyperinflation at above 50% in the months to come, they added.

1,Nation on tenterhooks as SC announces poll verdict today,Court rejects govt’s request for formation of full court to hear case,"The Supreme Court on Monday reserved its verdict on the PTI’s petition challenging the Election Commission of Pakistan’s order postponing the election in Punjab to be announced today (Tuesday).
A three-member bench headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial, and comprising Justices Munib Akhtar and Justice Ijazul Ahsan was hearing the petition.
The chief justice observed that the apex court did not wish to put people in a difficult situation. The hearings in the case, which lasted over a week, witnessed high drama after two judges of the original five-member bench — Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Aminuddin Khan — recused themselves from hearing the case. Thereafter, the chief justice constituted a bench comprising himself, Justice Ahsan and Justice Akhtar to proceed with the PTI petition.
Earlier, the government submitted a statement through Attorney General for Pakistan Mansoor Awan, requesting the formation of a full court to hear the case. It also sought dismissal of the PTI petition in the light of what it interpreted as a “4-3” order issued by the apex court on March 1.
During the course of hearing, the chief justice observed that ""the court will be blamed if anything would go wrong during the elections"", adding that it was because of this fear that political parties were given the option of resolving the matter through political dialogue. “None of the parties responded to the offer,”
""The Constitution is clear about when elections should be held,"" the chief justice maintained. The chief justice said that people believed they were above the Constitution and wanted their cases to be decided by judges of their preference. To this, the AGP said that no one had done so.
Irked by the government declaring ‘no-confidence’ in the three-member bench, the top court refused to listen to the arguments of the ruling parties’ lawyers.
Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) lawyer Akram Sheikh stated that he had appeared before the Supreme Court to assist it. He contended that he could make his own decisions if a party asked him to support something illegal. The lawyer added that he had the utmost respect for the apex court.
The chief justice stated that had respect for Sheikh, Farooq H Naek and Kamran Murtaza. However, the ruling parties had expressed no-confidence in the three-member bench hearing the case.
He added that Sheikh was not present before the court in a personal capacity, rather was there to represent a political party.
Adding to this, Justice Akhtar said that the lawyer’s power of attorney was also not filed in a personal capacity, adding that the government’s stance was relayed to the court by its staff through a statement shared from the PML-N’s Twitter account.
At one point during the hearing, the CJP noted that harmony among judges was crucial for the Supreme Court. He observed that while judicial proceedings were made public, consultations among judges were considered internal matters.
On the other hand, Justice Akhtar stated that if the “logic behind the 4-3 verdict” were accepted, the matter would be referred to the same nine-member bench that was first constituted to hear the elections suo motu proceedings.
He added that the decision then would either be of the five-member bench or the nine-member bench.
Justice Bandial pointed out that the detailed dissenting notes of the judges did not include any points about the reconstitution of the bench.
Earlier during the hearing, the court directed the defence secretary to submit a classified report to explain reasons why the armed forces are not available to perform security duties in general elections of provincial assemblies.
The chief justice also asked Defence Secretary Lieutenant General Rahmood-ul-Zaman to consider other forces like Pakistan Air Force, Pakistan Navy and Rangers if the armed forces were not available. ""These have the same respect as Pakistan Army,"" the chief justice said. He also asked whether reserved army officials could be called for elections duty.
Earlier, the defence secretary requested the court to allow in-camera briefing on the election issue. The bench, however, asked him to submit a written answer in a sealed envelope first.
Full court request
The chief justice said that the court always took caution when it came to taking suo motu notice, recalling that the first such notice this year was taken when the SC received requests from the speakers of two assemblies.
The CJP disagreed with the argument that this case was different from other cases under Article 184(3) of the Constitution. He inquired how the court could stop action on cases whose rules had already been established.
The chief justice emphasised that the procedure for jurisdiction under Article 184(3) was very strict. He highlighted that the judge who signed Justice Isa’s order had recused himself from the bench. And questioned how it was possible for Justice Isa, who authored the order, to hear the case.
He suggested that the government could request the formation of a larger bench, not a full court. He also said that he met senior judges in the past three days.
Meanwhile, the federal government told the court that organising and conducting free and fair elections in the presence of elected provincial governments in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa may not be possible.
Submitting its written response, the attorney general for Pakistan also urged the apex court to include the remaining six Supreme Court judges in the bench presiding over the case probing into the Election Commission of Pakistan's (ECP) decision to delay provincial assembly polls.
The concise statement stressed the need for a full bench to end the controversy regarding the 4 to 3 order.

2,CJ’s remarks draw flak from PM,"PM questions top judge on constitution of benches, corruption allegations against member of superior judiciary","Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday strongly criticised the remarks about lawmakers made by Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial during a recent Supreme Court hearing on the postponement of polls.
During the hearing of the PTI’s petition against the ECP’s decision to postpone polls to the Punjab Assembly till October 8, conducted on March 31, the chief justice had made the following remarks: “Today, when you go to parliament, you find people addressing the parliament who were till yesterday in captivity, imprisoned, declared traitors. They are now talking over there, and being respected because they are representatives of the people.”
The remarks had come a day after a bill aimed at clipping powers of the chief justice and giving the right to appeal in all suo motu cases with retrospective effect sailed through the Senate without being sent to the relevant standing committee. The bill, titled the ‘Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Bill 2023’, seeks to take away the discretionary powers of the CJP to take suo motu notice, form benches and allocate cases in an individual capacity.
Addressing the National Assembly session, the prime minister said that the Honourable Chief Justice had remarked that some people who have previously gone to jail are making speeches in the National Assembly today.
Shehbaz accused former prime minister Imran Khan and his collaborators of framing false cases against him and attempting to implicate him in those fabricated cases.
“Imran [Khan] Niazi had nothing else to do [during his time as prime minister]. He had only one objective, and he spent all his energy on trying to put the opposition leaders in jail. I was one of them. Imran Niazi sent me to jail not once, but twice. And he was prepared to send me to jail for a third time,” he said.
He said that the high court had granted him bail on merit the first time he was jailed. “This was during Imran Niazi’s tenure [as PM], and he had it challenged in the Supreme Court.”
He said that Imran’s friend, lawyer Naeem Bokhari, filed a petition in the apex court to dismiss his bail. “But then, after the court’s remarks [asking for justification to dismiss bail], Naeem Bokhari withdrew the petition and ran away.”
The second time, he said that a full bench of the LHC granted him bail again when Imran sent him to jail through “his nexus with the National Accountability Bureau”.
“It was four to one. That was also during Imran Niazi’s tenure, but he and his lackeys did not even try to challenge it in the Supreme Court like the first time.”
He said that each time he was released on merit and was now standing in the parliament by the grace of Allah. “My crime was that, [I was following] my party leader Nawaz Sharif and as leader of the then-opposition, we were countering the ill-devised policies of the PTI government and voiced our opposition. But Imran Niazi did not accept it. He considered us as a thorn in his way. He wanted to send us all to jail and continue playing the flute like Nero while Rome is set afire,” he said.
Questioning the chief justice’s remarks, the prime minister asked if it was a crime to be vindicated by the courts in false and baseless cases.
“Mr Speaker, the honourable chief justice said these words. So, is it a crime that after having fought my case in the high courts, they absolve me with a decision on merit? Is it a matter of pride and respect or of shame? Is it a mater of shame or of respect that today I am present in this House today with my head held high?” he asked.
“I want to ask the chief justice about the remarks that he made. Have we come here after being vindicated by the courts, or have we come here with dishonour and disrespect?”He stressed that, as elected members of Parliament, it was their right under the Constitution to express their views in Parliament.
The prime minister also noted serious allegations of corruption against certain members of the bench and questioned the message being sent to the whole country by including them on the bench.
“I want to ask the chief justice, that a judge facing serious corruption allegations, what kind of message do you want to give the nation and the world by sitting alongside him?”He emphasised that the law of equality must be applied to all and that double standards would not work.
The prime minister also said that the entire government coalition had expressed their lack of confidence on the current bench of the Supreme Court hearing the cases on the delay of elections in two provinces.
PM Shehbaz clarified that a meeting had taken place under his chairmanship in which leaders of coalition parties and their legal experts had decided to express their lack of confidence in the current bench. However, he emphasised that the word ""boycott"" was never used.
He said that the “complicated, contentious decision” by a bench of three judges was “contrary to all requirements of justice”. PM Shehbaz highlighted that Justice Ijazul Ahsan, another member of the bench, had recused himself from the case. He requested the Chief Justice of Pakistan, Justice Umar Ata Bandial, to constitute a full court without the two judges, as it would be more acceptable to the nation.
“I hope the chief justice will realise that if he convenes the full court, minus the two judges who have already recused themselves, then their decision would be acceptable to the entire nation,” he said.
The prime minister also noted that the decision to remove judges from the bench would be against the norms of justice.
Prior to the prime minister's address, the law minister briefed the house about the proceedings in the apex court and reiterated that the coalition parties had already conveyed to the court to constitute a full court to hear the instant case.

3,Govt wants SC to clear air on 4-3 or 3-2 verdict,AGP likely to submit statement to top court today to resolve controversy surrounding polls date order,"The federal government wants the Supreme Court to resolve the controversy surrounding the 4-3 decision on the dismissal of suo motu case about the announcement of the date to hold elections for the provincial assemblies first.
It is learnt that Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Awan would file a written statement in the top court on Monday (today), requesting it to clear the air on whether the verdict in the case was 4-3 or 3-2.
Two SC judges, Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, in their detailed order observed that the suo motu case in connection with the announcement of the elections date was dismissed by 4 to 3.
Later during the hearing, Justice Mandokhail noted that the order of the court in the case was not issued by Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial.
The government wants that the issue be settled by judges, who were not part of the initial nine-member larger bench.
“We think the six remaining judges in the SC should resolve the controversy as whether the suo motu case was dismissed by 4 to 3 or by 3 to 2 in the order wherein it was held that the president would announce the date of elections,” said a government official.
The official wondered how the judges, who were part of nine-member larger bench, could resolve this controversy.
The government also wants to raise another issue in the written submission as whether or not a judicial order could be discarded through a circular issued by the SC’s registrar.
However, one section of lawyers said  three members of bench had passed their opinions on a two-judge order, wherein it was held that hearing of all cases under Article 184 (3) should be postponed until amendments to the SC Rules, 1980 about the discretionary power of the CJP to form special benches were introduced.
Similarly, the government would also repeat the question whether or not a judge who had recused himself from the bench could hear the same case again.
However, it is learnt that the government functionaries, including the AGP, would not boycott court proceedings.
The lawyers for political parties might express strong reservations before the three-judge bench led by the CJP.
Sources told The Express Tribune that CJP Bandial had consulted with the SC judges to cool down the temperature, which was being felt after some happenings within top court.
The sources added that the CJP had met some senior SC judges but the outcome of these parleys was unclear yet.
However, no full court meeting was held so far.
The sources said it was for the first time that senior judges were invited by the CJP for talks to end the differences, which were being discussed in the public.
A senior lawyer said there was a complete mistrust between the judges and that was why the chief justice should take some confidence-building measures first.
He added that otherwise, the question would continue to be raised on the legitimacy of judgments.
The senior lawyer said the CJP should dispel the impression that the benches were being formed on the basis of personal liking and disliking.
He added that a full court, instead of a larger bench, was the only solution to this crisis.
Former additional attorney general Tariq Mahmood Khokhar said not all judges accepted the “absolutist” ways of the CJP.
“Adamancy has led to serious differences of opinion that have now culminated into a factious and fractious schism among brother judges,” he observed.
He added that “extraneous” influences had made matters worse.
Khokhar said there was evidence of a fit of pique and the constitutional institution was mired in shambles.
“Judges need to rise above the circumstances that they have created, overcome their sense of pique and attend to the constitutional trust they have sworn to protect, uphold and discharge,” he added.
Khokhar said the CJP should promptly countenance a full court and all others should accept it with grace.
“That should herald the beginning of the end of judicial discord,” he concluded.
However, the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) has disapproved any call for showing solidarity with any section of the SC.
PBC Executive Committee Chairman Hasan Raza Pasha said such a move would make the CJP controversial.
