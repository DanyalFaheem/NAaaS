2,Women’s tailors in a fix as demand dwindles,Buyers move towards ready-to-wear option as cost of stitching goes up,"The effects of inflation have become prominent on women's tailors, with businesses saying they have seen as much as 30 per cent decline in work as compared to last year.
One of the major reasons driving down demand for stitched clothes among women is the increase in prices of the cost of stitching as well the raw materials. This is at a time when the country is dealing with record inflation and households are already struggling to maintain their way of life.
The dressmakers have increased the cost of stitching a women's dress for Eid by up to Rs200 this year. The industry is struggling in acquiring raw materials and managing demand and delivery due to the increase prices and disruptions in power supply. One tailor said that they aren't getting enough orders, a stark contrast from previous years when they were inundated and didn't have enough hours in the day.
""We don't think we are taking out the 'not taking orders' board this year,"" said one tailor who specialises in sequined dresses. The buyers are also facing the same challenges. One woman said that she was getting only one dress stitched for herself while two each for the children this year as she was struggling to manage expenditure. Meanwhile, small time tailors who work out of their home are getting more work. These seasonal workers charge less than businesses that operate all year round.
The Express News conducted a survey which revealed that tailors who had been visiting the city in the past, including from rural Sindh, no longer had work. Their customers were switching to pret or ready-to-wear clothes. A plain dress which was stitched at Rs800 has now increased to Rs1,000 in Ramazan, while for a decorative hemline, it increases to Rs.1,200. Tailors in upscale areas have increased prices further.
Tanveer Ahmed, a tailor in Nazimabad, said that the price of elastic, which was Rs250 was now upto Rs350, Rs60 chalk became Rs150, and Rs.40 bukram was sold at Rs.70. The prices of buttons, thread, lace, needle, silk have also doubled. However, the numbers of customers are not increasing at the same pace, they said. Last year, Tanveer's junior workers had to work up to 14 hours a day to meet the target.
This year, he has the same number of people but fewer orders. Amjad Abbasi, who works in the Scheme 33, said that they try to take as many orders as much as they can deliver on time during Ramazan. He said that the increase in demand for pret was due to the price increase. Amjad expects that the customers would grow during the second half of Ramazan. However, he added, then there would be less time to get them ready. ""Then, when something goes wrong, the customers get angry,"" he added. Amjad acknowledged that the option to order ready-to-wear clothes online had also played in the decline in demand for stitched clothes. ""Some people like the convenience and want to avoid the hassle of the market,"" he said.
Atiya Nawab, a resident of Safora, said that she got her Eid dress stitched from a tailor in her area. ""In Ramazan, tailors increase prices and do not even pay proper attention due to the volume of orders,"" she said. She said that her tailor was a self-styled 'fashion designer' who didn't get the size right in her dress. ""When I pointed it out, the tailor made an excuse saying there wasn't enough fabric,"" she said. Atiya said she had to get it altered from a different tailor. Sanam, a resident of Scheme 33, complained that during Ramazan, tailors would often forget instructions during the month of Ramazan.
""Last year, the lace was attached at the wrong place and the sleeves were long,"" she said. She said that she prefers her old tailor who would make sure he noted down everything.
Carving a niche
Even as women's tailors struggle, those who are sewing at home and have cultivated a reputation continue to be flooded with orders. Faria Khan says her tailors would often tell her that they didn't have time or cite power outages, especially during Ramazan.
She now gets her dresses stitched from a woman who works out of her home. ""Her prices are also reasonable and she delivers the suit on time,"" she said. Zeenat, a woman who stitches at home, said that she stitches in Ramazan every year and earns up to Rs10,000 per day. She delivers orders till the eve of Eid (chand raat) and then stitches clothes for her family.

3,"Protests continue against refugees, maritime zone bills",Chandio said the maritime bill is a renewed attempt to occupy the islands of Sindh,"Progressive and nationalist parties of Sindh continued to protest against the proposed of National Refugee Bill, 2023, and Pakistan Maritime Zones Bill 2021 waiting approvals in the National Assembly and the Senate.
The workers of Awami Tehreek staged a protest outside Hyderabad Press Club on Sunday, opposing the tabling of National Refugee Bill, 2023, and Pakistan Maritime Zones Bill, 2021, in the upper and the lower house of the parliament. The AT leader Advocate Ismail Khaskheli contended that the refugee bill is an effort to pave the way for giving nationality to the illegal immigrants whose majority is living in Sindh.
He said the digital population census in which the condition of showing the national identity card was waived for the headcount and the bill are parts of the same conspiracy against the province's native population. ""We consider both these bills as attacks on Sindh."" Khaskheli said the center wanted to occupy the islands of Sindh in the garb of the maritime bill.
He vowed to resist both the bills by leading protest movements in the province. Meanwhile, the Jeay Sindh Mahaz has rejected National Refugee Bill, 2023, and Pakistan Maritime Zones Bill, 2021, as detrimental to the rights and interests of Sindh province and its people. The party's chairman Riaz Ali Chandio said the maritime bill is a renewed attempt to occupy the islands of Sindh and to create more artificial islands controlled by the center near the coastline. He considered the refugee bill as an attempt to legalize the illegal stay of foreign nationals particularly of Afghan origin in Pakistan, mainly in Sindh.
He said as per the United Nations, the declared refugees are restricted to stay only in the refugee camps unlike in Sindh where they have been allowed to live, trade and work.

4,Mismanagement blamed for deadly factory stampede,Burial of victims continue as bereaved families collect bodies from mortuaries,"Survivors of the deadly SITE Area factory stampede blame mismanagement for the tragedy as relatives mourned the death of their loved ones. Twelve people, mostly women and children, were killed and 10 were injured in the stampede for Zakat cash handouts at the factory on Friday.
Among the victims was Muhafiya, mother of five and resident of Orangi Town. She was laid to rest at a local graveyard after her last rites. Muhafiya was dropped off at the factory gate by her husband, who is an auto-rickshaw driver.
Some women from the neighbourhood were already there to collect cash handouts and food rations. ""When we reached the factory, 2,000 to 2,500 women were already present there in a long queue to collect Rs2,000 cash handout each,"" Muhafiya's husband recalled while speaking to media persons at the funeral. ""Seeing the rush, I advised my wife against going inside,"" he added. But she would not listen. He waited outside the factory as some women came out emptyhanded due to rush.
""Suddenly, when the management opened the factory gate, there was commotion which was followed by shouting and crying as a stampede happened,"" he recalled. When his wife did not return, he rushed inside to search for his wife but found her lying dead on the ground. He said that his wife lost her life in the hope of receiving Rs2,000 cash handout thinking that it would help the mitigate the family's financial problems.
The distraught husband blamed mismanagement at the Zakat distribution for the tragedy. ""They should have not allowed so many people to gather at the factory if they did not know how to control them,"" he said. ""When so many people gather and there is no arrangement to manage the crowd, then chaos is bound to happen."" A large number of family members, relatives, and neighbours were present at the deceased's residence to offer condolences. They were angry at the factory management as they blamed so many deaths on mismanagement.
Meanwhile the funeral prayer for a teenager, Saad, who also died in the stampede, was also offered in Nazimabad. The bereaved father said that nothing was dearer than children. ""This tragic incident occurred due to mismanagement by the factory management,"" he said. The body of another young victim, Umm Haniya, was also shifted to her residence in Ghazigoth, Orangi Town, for funeral from the Chippa mortuary. She was later buried in a local cemetery.

7,‘Babus’ enjoy joyride on taxpayers’ money,"Departments say vehicles are seldom returned, have no hope of their return","As corruption continues to offset the stable functioning of the country, the misappropriation of state issued vehicles by former officials and their acquaintances leaves the concerned provincial departments in dire straits.
Despite legal rules binding office holders to return state assigned automobiles back to the issuing departments upon successful completion of their term, many officials continue to hold on to these cars. According to data provided by the Excise and Taxation Department, the Sindh government owns roughly 12,000 automobiles in departments including education, health, police, revenue collection, law and the legislative assembly. “Once the elected terms of the ministers, advisors, and other politicians ends, they rarely return the state vehicles to the respective departments, keeping them instead for their personal use,” claimed a source from the provincial excise department.
Such is the case of the Sindh Assembly, which holds the registration of 113 automobiles, mostly Toyota Corolla XLI’s. Of these, 24 were designated for use by several chairmen of the parliamentary committees of various state departments following the parliamentary elections of 2013. While the Sindh Assembly Secretariat had expected to receive the automobiles back in 2018 upon the end of the fiveyear term, neither were the vehicles returned nor were their whereabouts reported.
“More than four years have passed since, and it appears as if the cars vanished into thin air,” said Muhammad Khan Rind, a senior secretary at the Sindh Assembly. Rind added that the provincial administration had alerted the inspector general (IG) of the Sindh Police last year, but no solid evidence about the fate of these cars could be obtained.
While state officials misappropriating government owned automobiles is a strong case of corruption, reports from other departments show that it is only the tip of the iceberg. Multiple sources from the Sindh Archives Department claim that the state cars are also seen in the use of individuals who are acquaintances of ministers, advisors, and special assistants and are not in any way associated with the issuing department. Where some vehicles are missing, others remain parked in the premises of state departments, seemingly without any use.
“Almost 100 automobiles in immaculate condition, including Suzuki Cultus and Mehran, have been parked outside the Law Department sinceforever,” revealed a source from the Law Department, which owns a total of 900 automobiles. Reportedly, the automobiles were presented to the judicial officers of Sindh, who upon their upgradation to bigger cars, abandoned these vehicles. “The Sindh High Court (SHC) has retrieved all of the automobiles that were parked outside the Law Department, and will announce a decision soon,” informed the source from the Law Department.
When quizzed about this misappropriation of public assets, the Local Governments Minister, Syed Nasir Hussain Shah said that he was not aware that the vehicles had not been returned. “We will look into the matter and take action against those found violating public trust,” informed Shah, while talking to The Express Tribune.
