0,‘Pakistan at risk amid critically low reserves’,"Forecasts highest inflation, 2nd lowest GDP growth in 46 Asian nations","The Asian Development Bank (ADB) warned on Tuesday that Pakistan is at dire risk because of low foreign exchange reserves, foreseeing the country will have the highest inflation and the second lowest economic growth among 46 Asian nations.
“A return to political stability with the formation of a new government after scheduled general elections will improve business sentiment,” said the Asian Development Outlook, the flagship publication of the Manila-based lending agency which was released on Tuesday.
“Macroeconomic conditions have deteriorated seriously in the current fiscal year and Pakistan is at dire risk because international reserves have reached critically lows.”
The official reserves remain around $4.2 billion, not enough to finance one month of imports.
The report added that the economic outlook appears weak with substantial risks from slower global growth or any further increases in world energy and food prices, caused by the Russia-Ukraine war.
The lender projected a mere 0.6% gross domestic product (GDP) growth for the current fiscal year, the second worst among developing Asia, after Sri Lanka that would see a 3% contraction.
Worryingly, average inflation in Pakistan is projected at 27.5%, the highest in developing Asia, but still lower than what the actual figure can be by June 2023.
Average inflation has already peaked at 27.3% in the first nine months of current fiscal year. The annual inflation rate was 35.4% in March.
The ADB saw difficulties for Pakistan in arranging foreign loans and described the current situation “as dire”.
Bilateral and multilateral sources of affordable external financing would be hampered by higher international interest rates, weaker market sentiment, or tighter global financing conditions, it added.
The ADB stated that investors’ confidence will be restored only after a new government is in place after the next scheduled general elections.
“The stalled IMF programme must be resumed to buttress falling reserves and ease the balance of payments crisis, in part by catalysing financing from other sources,” it said.
The World Bank on Tuesday also expressed similar views on Pakistan’s economic outlook.
“Weighing on economic activity are the difficult political situation, economic losses, devastation from flooding, ongoing foreign exchange crisis, tighter macroeconomic policies, and challenging external environment,” said the ADB report.
It added that high inflation will affect the purchasing power and thus restrain domestic demand.
The economic growth is forecast to improve only to 2% in the next fiscal year, that too by assuming sustained macroeconomic policies, reform implementation, recovery from supply shocks caused by flooding, and improving external conditions.
The Asian Development Outlook has clubbed Pakistan and Sri Lanka in many ways as the two countries, among 46, are presumably facing the worst conditions.
“Pakistan and Sri Lanka face a challenging outlook,” said the report.
But Sri Lanka’s growth prospects are expected to improve next year on the back of IMF’s $2.9 billion financing and associated reforms approved on March 20.
In South Asia, inflation is expected to remain high, driven by Pakistan and Sri Lanka, according to the ADB.
South Asia’s inflation rate is expected to decline to only 8.1% this year from 8.2% in 2022. India will account for most of the decrease where headline inflation is expected to slow to 5% this year and 4.5% in 2024.
Inflation in Sri Lanka is forecast at 24.6%, the second worst after Pakistan. For the next fiscal year, the ADB projected 15% inflation for Pakistan and 5.5% for Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka’s rupee, the worst-performing currency in 2022, has appreciated since the fourth quarter on improved inflows. Pakistan’s rupee plunged to the lowest level of nearly Rs288 to a dollar on Tuesday.
The ADB said that the IMF programme is critical but “risks to the outlook and (IMF) programme implementation are high, tilting to the downside because of challenges both domestic and external.”
Timely and decisive implementation of IMF policies is critical for Pakistan to regain macroeconomic stability, as is securing financial support from other development partners, according to the ADB.
It stated that Pakistan’s agriculture sector will likely contract in this fiscal year – for the first time in two decades. This follows massive losses to cotton, wheat and rice crops caused by flooding, as well as the loss of livestock.
A flood-induced supply shock severely affects industry and services. The production of textiles, which are normally 25% of industrial output and about 60% of export goods, is expected to plunge because prices for imported cotton to replace domestic supply are driven up by the foreign exchange crisis.
The decline in food and livestock production will reduce slaughtering and food processing. The industry faces additional pressures as higher inflation and an expected tightening of fiscal and monetary policies curb domestic demand.
Moreover, liquidity shortages caused by depleted foreign currency reserves are disrupting supply chains and making it harder to import essential raw materials, intermediate goods, and machinery for industry. Consequently, many factories have either closed temporarily or operate below capacity.
The growth in services is projected to slow as a contraction in agriculture and industry drags down wholesale and transportation services, which are half of the sector. Further weakening of economic activity overall is expected from continued supply disruption caused by the loss of flooding of critical transportation infrastructure.

1,Oil stable on demand woes,Investors weigh OPEC+ plans to cut more production,"Oil prices were little changed in choppy trading on Tuesday as investors debated OPEC+ plans to cut more production and weak economic data from the US and China that could hurt oil demand.
Brent crude futures were down 30 cents to $84.63 a barrel by 1505 GMT. US WTI crude futures traded at $80.19 a barrel, down 23 cents. Both benchmarks jumped by more than 6% on Monday after OPEC+ rocked markets with an announcement of voluntary production cuts of 1.66 million barrels per day (bpd) from May.
Goldman Sachs lifted its forecast for Brent to $95 a barrel by the end of this year, and to $100 for 2024.
However, a slump in US manufacturing activity in March to its lowest level in nearly three years, and weak manufacturing activity in China last month raised demand concerns.

2,"SBP expects IMF revival, $10b reserves by June",Projected CAD to be below $6b for FY2023 – had earlier projected CAD at $9b,"Pakistan is on the brink of a financial breakthrough, as the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) anticipates the International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme worth $6.5 billion will soon be revived. The bank has projected that the foreign exchange reserves will be above $10 billion by the end of June 2023, according to SBP Governor Jameel Ahmad.
Speaking at an analyst briefing on the latest monetary policy statement, Ahmad stated that the bank had revised down its projection for the current account deficit (CAD) to below $6 billion for the current fiscal year.
In January 2023, the bank had projected the deficit (CAD) at around $9 billion for the year, it was learnt.
Experts believe that the revival of the IMF programme will lead to the removal of all restrictions on imports.
Topline Research’ analyst Yousuf M Farooq said in a note after attending the briefing that Ahmad said discussions are ongoing with IMF and that the last hurdle was financing commitments (from friendly countries), which he expected to come in soon.
According to Ismail Iqbal Securities Head of Research Fahd Rauf, Ahmad believes that “inflows are conditioned on the IMF programme, and once the staff-level agreement (SLA) is finalised with the IMF, the SBP is hopeful that foreign exchange reserves will exceed $10 billion by June 2023.”
The country’s foreign exchange reserves currently stand at $4.24 billion.
Ahmad held the briefing after announcing that the bank had increased its key policy rate by 100 basis points to 21%. Experts believe that this policy rate is at an all-time high.
Now, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar is scheduled to visit the US from April 10 to 16 to attend the annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank. He, along with a high official team, will talk to the IMF team for the revival of its loan programme.
Ahmad also stated that Pakistan is to repay foreign debt worth only $2.2 billion in three months, while the size of commercial loans stands at a meagre $100 million. Besides, the government remains hopeful that it will get foreign debt of another $2.3 billion rolled over until the end of June.
Ahmad’s briefing suggests that the government will manage with the critically low foreign exchange reserves, until the IMF programme is revived, and mitigate the risk of default on foreign debt repayment, going forward.
“Nonetheless, the overall balance of payments position continues to remain under stress, with foreign exchange reserves still at low levels,” according to SBP’s latest monetary policy statement. The statement emphasises that “the early conclusion of the 9th review under the IMF programme is critical to rebuild the FX reserve buffers.”
The statement says that economic activities have continued to slow down for multiple reasons, including the continuous monetary policy tightening itself. “Growth in FY23 will be significantly lower than the post-floods assessment of November 2022. Growth in tax revenues has remained below target, amidst a slowdown in economic activity, reduction in imports, and inadequate policy focus on expanding the tax net, while debt servicing has increased,” it said.

3,Rupee plumbs new low at 287.29 vs dollar,Delay in inflow of foreign financing sparks some panic in currency market,"Pakistani rupee on Tuesday slumped to a new all-time low close at Rs287.29 against the US dollar following persistent delay in revival of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme and the looming risk of default on foreign debt repayment.
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reported that the rupee shed 0.78% of its value, or Rs2.25, and closed at Rs287.29 against the greenback in inter-bank market. It had closed at Rs285.04/$ on Monday. Earlier, the domestic currency had hit the record low at Rs285.09/$ a month ago on March 3, 2023.
In brief comments to The Express Tribune, Topline Securities CEO Mohammad Sohail said “delay in the IMF loan programme and inflows from friendly countries created some panic in the currency market.”
Market talk suggests that importers were buying US dollars in panic while their supply had slowed down.
It comes despite the government’s announcement that Finance Minister Ishaq Dar will visit the US from April 10-16 to attend annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank, where he will also try to persuade the IMF to resume its $6.5 billion loan programme.
Pakistan has been locked in talks with the IMF since late January as the delay in revival of the loan programme, which has been on hold since November 2022, has choked inflows of foreign financing. Consequently, the country’s foreign exchange reserves have depleted to the critically low level of $4.24 billion.
Analysts are foreseeing a serious threat of default by Pakistan on foreign debt repayment in the near future. It has to repay $4.5 billion in three months (April-June) but half of the amount is expected to be rolled over.
Gold shines
With the rupee’s fresh depreciation, gold price shot up to a new record high at Rs214,500 per tola (11.66 grams) on Tuesday, also aided by the rise in global commodity prices.
The bullion price rose by 2.38%, or Rs5,000, to Rs214,500 per tola, according to the All Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association. The previous record of Rs210,500 per tola had been reached a few months ago.
In the international market, the precious metal rose by $12 to $1,982 per ounce (31.10 grams).

4,PSO’s receivables surge to all-time high of Rs742.3b,Claims Rs6.7 billion in losses against SNGPL for the supply of LNG,"Pakistan State Oil (PSO) is facing a financial crisis amidst the ongoing freefall of the Pakistani rupee against the US dollar. The company has booked claims of Rs6.7 billion against gas Utility-Sui Northern Gas Pipeline Limited (SNGPL) for the supply of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). PSO had entered the LNG business during the tenure of the previous government in 2015, which led to financial difficulties as the company struggled to receive multibillion rupees against its supplies.
The government’s use of expensive LNG in domestic sectors during the winter season to overcome gas crises, and the provision of subsidised LNG to five export-oriented sectors, including textiles, have put government companies on the brink of financial collapse.
The fertiliser sector has also been utilising subsidised gas, despite the substantial growth shown by the textile sector. However, textile sectors and ginning factories have added to the woes of farmers as they have been reluctant to buy cotton. With the cotton sowing season underway, farmers are still waiting for buyers to sell their previous crop. SNGPL has been unable to receive bills for LNG supplies to domestic sectors and cannot pay the bills of LNG supplied by PSO. Currently, PSO’s receivables have surged to an all-time high of Rs742.3 billion, with SNGPL being the largest defaulter to pay Rs464 billion for receiving LNG.
PSO imports LNG from Qatar and supplies it to SNGPL for onward distribution to customers. However, due to the speedy variation in the exchange rate during imports of LNG, PSO has suffered a loss of Rs6.75 billion against SNGPL. The receivables against customers continue to rise and pose a serious threat to oil and gas supply. PSO also supplies oil to different clients across the country and provides LNG for a public gas utility. However, circular debt has emerged in the supply of imported LNG, contributing Rs464 billion to the debt.
Of the total receivables, PSO has to receive Rs178 billion from the power sector on account of oil supply for electricity generation. Generation companies are the major defaulters who have to pay Rs147.6 billion, with Hubco owing Rs25.3 billion and Kapco owing Rs5 billion.
During the PTI government’s tenure, a bill was passed to introduce the weighted average cost of gas, which is the average price of imported LNG and locally produced natural gas, to curtail circular debt in the gas sector. Earlier, there was no legal framework for recovering LNG prices from domestic consumers, leading to the piling up of receivables.
However, the weighted average gas bill was challenged in the Sindh high court, and even the PPP had announced its intention to become a party in it. Due to the lack of a legal framework, domestic consumers have not paid their LNG bills, leading to the failure of SNGPL to pay bills to PSO. Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) is another major defaulter as PSO supplies jet fuel to the airline for running its operations. PIA has to pay Rs25.7 billion to PSO.
The state-run oil marketing company is also due to receive Rs8.93 billion from the government on account of price differential claims. On the other hand, PSO has to pay Rs88 billion to oil refineries for fuel supply. It owes Rs52.9 billion to the Pak-Arab Refinery Company, Rs12 billion to Pakistan Refinery Limited, Rs3.2 billion to National Refinery Limited, Rs16.3 billion to Attock Refinery Limited, and Rs2.6 million to Enar. It has to pay Rs 228 billion to retire letters of credit, standby letter of credits (SBLC) and Kuwait Petroleum Corporation for LNG payments.

5,‘Loans needed to avert debt crisis’,World Bank says economic shocks pushed 3.9 million into poverty in FY2023,"The World Bank, on Tuesday, said that various economic shocks pushed nearly four million Pakistanis into poverty this fiscal year. The lender also urged Islamabad to immediately arrange fresh foreign loans to avert a “public debt crisis”.
The Pakistan Development Update – a flagship report from the lender, has warned Pakistan about serious dangers to its economic and debt viability while projecting almost flat economic growth, with an average inflation rate of 29.5% for the current fiscal year.
The future also remains “highly uncertain”, with only 0.4% economic growth projected this year and 2% for the next fiscal year. The average inflation rate for FY2023 is projected at 29.5% and at 18.5% for next year – indicating that the annual inflation rate will be much higher.
In the absence of public transfers that cover income losses or mitigate the impact of higher prices, “poverty is projected to increase to 37.2% in FY23, pushing an additional 3.9 million people into poverty as compared to last fiscal year,” according to the World Bank.
Poverty is measured at the lower middle-income poverty line, $3.65 per day based on 2017 PPPs per capita. The depth and severity of poverty has also increased, reflecting the overlapping impacts of multiple shocks and households’ lack of savings to mitigate short-term impacts.
The WB said that the inflation outlook suggested that real interest rates will remain in the negative, possibly warranting further policy tightening in the near-term.
Debt crisis
The World Bank emphasised that implementing macroeconomic and structural reforms agreed under the IMF programme and securing the much-needed external refinancing is critical to restoring macro-stability, confidence and “averting a public debt crisis”.
The WB language indicates growing discomfort among international creditors due to Pakistan’s dilly-dallying approach with the IMF.
The report stated that Pakistan’s external financing needs are projected to be, on average, $28.9 billion per year, or 8% of GDP, during FY23-FY25, including IMF repayments, maturing Eurobonds, and repayments against Chinese commercial loans. But the reserves position is projected to gradually improve.
In the current situation, the IMF programme is an anchor to staying on course for reforms, said Najy Benhassine, the Country Director of the WB. He added that this was not an easy time to write the Pakistan Development Update report.
“The outlook is highly uncertain and hinges on strong political ownership and effective implementation of critical reforms,” according to the report. It added that non-completion of the IMF programme and failure to secure expected rollovers, refinancing, and new financing from key bilateral partners presents major risks.
Currently, Pakistan has minimal economic buffers to withstand any additional domestic or external shocks, according to the report. Even with the IMF programme on-track, reserves are expected to remain precariously low. Maintaining stability will require that (IMF) programme reforms are sustained and deepened, with additional new external financing flows required over the medium-term.
“Downside risks to the outlook remain very high,” said Adnan Ghumman, author of the report. These include politically-driven slippages in fiscal policy in the context of upcoming elections, constraints on foreign exchange liquidity and uncertainties around external funding inflows, rising levels of public debt, growing exposure of banks to the public sector, and political instability, he added.
Ghumman said that the outflow of dollars has decreased by 80% during the first half of FY2023, which has impacted investor confidence.
Pakistan has effectively lost access to international capital markets, which is now making it difficult to arrange even $6 billion in additional loans to revive the IMF programme.
Any substantial departure from the current macroeconomic framework would exacerbate external and domestic financing risks, and potentially place debt on an unsustainable path, said Benhassine.
“The resolution of Pakistan’s economic crisis requires commitment to sustained macro-fiscal and structural reforms,” he said, adding that, “This is needed both to unlock fresh financing and avoid a balance of payments crisis and lay the foundation for a recovery of private investor confidence and higher growth over the medium term.”

6,Industries face shutdown on prolonged gas suspension,Senior official at SSGC claims there was no curtailment of gas to industries,"Karachi’s business community is in crisis due to the prolonged suspension of gas supply to industries in the city. Businessmen are calling on the government to restore gas supply to industries with ample pressure, or they will have no choice but to shut down their production units themselves. The President of Karachi Chamber of Commerce & Industry (KCCI), Mohammed Tariq Yousuf, expressed deep concerns about the situation and appealed to the government to take immediate action.
“It was highly unfair to have such an attitude towards Karachi’s business community which, despite facing so many odds and challenges, contributes around 54% in terms of exports and more than 68% in terms of revenue,” said Yousuf.
Speaking to the Express Tribune, Energy sector analyst at Insight Securities, Asad Ali explained that the decline in gas production due to diminishing reserves has resulted in a downward trend, and importing gas seems to be the only viable option. “To achieve this, the government must implement the Weighted Average Cost of Gas (WACOG) bill, which will unify gas prices of both domestic and imported gas. This approach will not only alleviate the shortage of gas but also address the issue of escalating circular debt.”
According to Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC), gas supply has gone down to 772 mmcfd from 810 mmcfd, which was originally 1000 mmcfd. As a result, the industries have to go through severe gas load shedding.
The President of Lasbela Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Ismail Suttar told the Express Tribune that he believes that Pakistan needs to immediately stop supplying piped gas to domestic consumers and instead increase gas prices by supplying them LNG through cylinders. He explained that this is the normal practice in every country worldwide, and Pakistan needs to adopt this approach.
The KCCI president stated that the industries cannot function without gas, and the suspension of gas supply leads to a rise in the cost of production, making finished goods uncompetitive.
While vehemently condemning SSGC for suspending gas supply to Captive Power Plants (CPPs) of General Industries, Yousuf said that this was a highly deplorable move as it has intensified the problems for the industries who simply cannot depend on unreliable electricity being supplied by KE.
“CPPs provide reliable electricity to general industries which helps in keeping the high-tech machineries involved in the entire production line operational. It is a well-known fact that even minor electricity fluctuation for a few microseconds disrupts the entire production line terribly, damaging the pricey machinery and causes heavy monetary losses during production,” he said.
Speaking to the Express Tribune, Head of Corporate Communication of SSGC, Salman A Siddiqui claimed that there was no curtailment of gas to industries by SSGC. Gas supplies have been discontinued only for their power generation to all non-exporting industries to facilitate domestic customers in augmenting their gas pressures for preparation of Sehri and Iftaar.

7,Cement sales decline by 24.19% in March 2023,"APCMA blames political noise, economic uncertainty for situation","The cement industry in Pakistan is facing challenging times as it witnessed a sharp decline in despatches in March 2023. According to data released by the All-Pakistan Cement Manufacturers Association (APCMA), total cement despatches during the month were 3.795 million tonnes, down by 24.19% from 5.006 million tonnes despatched during the same month of the previous year.
The decline in local cement despatches was even more significant, with a drop of 28.75% from 4.710 million tonnes in March 2022 to 3.356 million tonnes in March 2023. However, there was a silver lining in the form of increased export despatches, which rose by 48.46% from 295,321 tonnes to 438,433 tonnes during the same period.
The northern region of Pakistan witnessed a decline of 28.22% in cement despatches, while the southern region witnessed a drop of 9.48%. Domestic despatches by north-based cement mills were down by 29.33%, while those by south-based mills dropped by 26.14%.
Exports from north-based mills increased by 24.63% to 100,431 tonnes, and those from south-based mills rose by 57.40% to 338,002 tonnes.
During the first nine months of the current fiscal year, total cement despatches were 17.59% lower than the corresponding period of the previous year. Domestic despatches were down by 15.40%, while export despatches fell by 34.62%.
The APCMA spokesperson blamed the decline on a decrease in construction activities in both the northern and southern regions of the country, which is also affecting employment opportunities for skilled and unskilled labour. He added that continued political instability, currency devaluation, and poor economic conditions are adversely affecting all industrial sectors, including cement.

8,China’s reopening uplifts Asia growth outlook,"Turmoil in global banking sector, war in Ukraine pose challenges","Developing Asia will grow faster than previously thought this year, underpinned by a stronger-than-projected rebound in China, but risks from global banking turmoil could weigh on the outlook, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said on Tuesday.
Developing Asia, which groups together 46 economies in the Asia-Pacific, is forecast to grow 4.8% in 2023, the ADB said in its Asian Development Outlook report, more than its previous estimate of 4.6% in December, and following 4.2% growth in 2022.
Driving the region’s growth this year is China’s recovery after it ended its zero-Covid policy in December, with the world’s second-biggest economy seen expanding 5% this year, the ADB said, above its earlier estimate of 4.3%.
China’s reopening “is really going to create the strongest kind of support for growth in the region this year,” said ADB Chief Economist Albert Park.
While China’s embattled property sector “remains a point of concern”, Park said the upside risks to China’s growth outlook outweigh downside risks. “If life returns to normal quickly and confidence comes back, growth could even be higher than 5% which would be even better for the region,” he said.
Excluding China, the region is expected to grow 4.6% this year, slower than last year’s 5.4% pace. Even as growth in developing Asia gathers pace, the ADB warned challenges remain, including turbulence in the global banking sector and an escalation in the Ukraine war, which could cause a surge in commodity prices.
But for now, turmoil in the global banking sector, will not turn into “a bigger crisis of the financial system in the US”, Park said even as he urged policymakers to stay vigilant. From 4.4% in 2022, inflation is forecast to decelerate to 4.2% this year and 3.3% next year, the ADB said, but warned that core inflation remained high in some economies and required close monitoring.
