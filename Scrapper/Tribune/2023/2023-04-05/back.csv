0,Fire breaks out at Dasu dam camp,Police said blaze ruined a warehouse complex for the Dasu hydropower project in the Kohistan district,"A fire ripped through the camp of a Chinese company managing the construction of a remote hydropower dam in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa on Tuesday, officials said.
Since 2015, Beijing has poured billions of dollars into Pakistan under an investment scheme known as the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
Private firms have also flooded over the border to service contracts on ambitious infrastructure projects, despite persistent threats from terrorist attacks.
Police said on Tuesday’s pre-dawn blaze ruined a warehouse complex for the Dasu hydropower project in the Kohistan district.
""It was a huge fire,"" a Rescue 1122 official at the site told AFP. ""Initially, the flames were very high and we had to call for fire brigade vehicles from two other districts.""
""It was quite a big storehouse, and apart from oil drums, stationery and machinery were also stockpiled there. That's all been destroyed in the fire,"" he added.
In 2017, the water ministry awarded the construction contract for the Dasu dam to the China Gezhouba Group Company.
The camp housed Chinese engineers, surveyors and mechanics, but both police and Rescue 1122 said none were injured or killed.
One police official said an electrical fault was the suspected cause of the fire.
In July 2021, 12 people -- including nine Chinese workers -- were killed aboard a bus carrying staff to the Dasu site, with Beijing insisting it was a bomb attack.

1,"2022 by-elections cost over Rs1.59b, Senate told","Amid protests, chairman assures senators he will ensure presence of ministers","The Senate chairman has assured the senators that he will ensure the presence of ministers during the sessions of the upper house of parliament amid protests against their absence.

2,Karakoram Highway to get facelift with Rs16b,Senate informed about the proposed funds allocation for rehabilitation of N-35,"Minister of State for Law and Justice Shahadat Awan on Tuesday informed the Senate that an amount of Rs16.239 billion had been proposed for widening and rehabilitation of the existing N-35 (Karakoram Highway), passing through Abbottabad in the forthcoming Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) for the year 2023-24.
Replying to a calling attention notice raised by Kamran Murtaza about severe traffic jams in Abbottabad city due to non-construction of flyovers and underpasses, the minister said the project had been included in the PSDP for 2023-24 in order to address the longstanding issue of traffic jams in the city.
The project has been divided into three packages, he added.
He said package one included the road from Muslim Abad to Bus Stand, package two from Allah-Hu Chowk to Allah-Hu Chowk and package-3 from Allah-hu Chowk to APS School.
He admitted that it was a longstanding issue, adding that it was already under consideration by the government.
Earlier, Kamran Murtaza had raised concerns about the problems faced by the people, particularly tourists, due to traffic jams in the Abbottabad city.

3,Pakistan sees India creating hurdles in SCO participation,"Islamabad mulls Delhi invitation for SCO defence, foreign ministers’ meetings","Pakistan may be considering to attend the key ministerial meetings of Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in India but initial internal assessment suggests the Modi government may create a situation to make it difficult for the country to send its delegates.
Official sources familiar with the development told The Express Tribune on Tuesday that Pakistan was considering the invitation India extended as the president of SCO for the upcoming meetings of defence and foreign ministers.
The SCO defence ministers meeting is scheduled to be held later this month in Delhi while the foreign ministers’ huddle will take place in May in Goa. India extended the invitations for both the meetings.
However, there is a sense within the Foreign Office that India may not be interested in Pakistan attending those high-profile meetings because of the Modi government’s policy.
“We haven’t yet arrived at a final decision. However, there is a feeling that even if Pakistan intends to send its ministers, the Modi government may create a situation where it will become difficult for us to attend the SCO ministerial meetings,” a source with knowledge of the closed-door consultations said.
The source claimed that under the current circumstances, it did not suit Prime Minister Modi that Pakistan attends the SCO meetings in India. The general elections are due in the neighbouring country next year and Prime Minister Modi always cashed in on his anti-Pakistan campaign.
The reason sources made such an assessment were certain recent events. For example, they referred to one such expert-level meeting where Pakistan’s invitation was virtually withdrawn by India over objecting the map Pakistani delegation used during the preparatory meeting.
The map showed the whole of Jammu and Kashmir as a disputed territory, something India objected to.
Similarly, India has refused to send its cricket team to Pakistan for the Asia Cup later this year. Instead, India wants to move the Asian Cup out of Pakistan or intends to play at a neutral venue. This may create a situation where it would make it difficult for the Pakistan government to permit the Green Shirts to travel to India later this year for the 50-over World Cup.
There is already a proposal under consideration where Pakistan may play all its world cup matches in Bangladesh.
All this, according to the sources, reflected that the Indian government was not keen even to revive sporting ties let alone engaging with Pakistan on regional forums.
Nevertheless, the decision to attend the SCO ministerial meetings would be taken closer to the events. China will also have a say in Pakistan’s decision.

4,Digital census date extended to April 10,This is the first ever digital census to be held in the country," 
The Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) has extended the end date of the ongoing 7th Population and Housing Census to April 10, 2023 in order to ensure 100% coverage. This is the first ever digital census to be held in the country.
According to a press release issued on Tuesday, the chief census commissioner extended the date on the request of provincial census commissioners who wanted more time to complete the leftover work.
It said the PBS has successfully collected data of 95% listed households within the stipulated time frame through tablets across the country with only 5% census fieldwork left either in big-blocks, blocks where census work started with some delay due to logistic arrangements or where the work was suspended for a couple of days due to some technical glitches.
“In case enumerators have not visited, all citizens of Pakistan are being requested to inform the PBS using the toll free number [0800-57574] which will be functional 24/7.
“Citizens can also send their complete address through SMS on 9727 for lodging complaints of non-coverage. They can also visit or contact the PBS Regional Offices or the 495 Census Support Center established at the tehsil level for registering their complaints regarding non-coverage,” it said.

5,PTI to move SC for holding K-P polls today,Says will raise governor’s decision of not holding polls in 90 days despite court orders,"The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf has decided to file a petition in the Supreme Court for conducting elections of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Assembly.
The PTI K-P spokesperson said that an application will be filed in the Supreme Court on Wednesday (today), regarding the holding of elections in the province.
The decision of K-P Governor Haji Ghulam Ali regarding not holding the elections within 90 days of the dissolution of the provincial assembly despite the court orders will be raised.
According to the PTI, the Supreme Court ordered to hold the election in Punjab within 90 days as per the Constitution, while issuing a decision to look at the issue of K-P separately.
PTI sources said that a separate writ petition was being filed in the Supreme Court regarding the date of election in K-P. On behalf of the lawyers, they said, the application will be submitted to the court on Thursday.
Former provincial minister Taimur Jhagra said that an application would be filed in the Supreme Court for the K-P Assembly election.
“No one needs to worry about the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa elections. Those who have not given the date [for elections] have violated Article 6.”
Like the Pakistan Democratic Movement, he said, the lawyer of K-P governor had also fled the court.
“The elections in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa should also be held within 90 days as per the Constitution.”

6,FIR in prohibited funding case silent on Imran’s role,Court in written order says ‘no evidence’ found that remitted amount sent by Arif Naqvi was from black money,"The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday issued a written order regarding the termination of FIA’s appeal against the bail of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan in the prohibited funding case, stating that the allegations made in it had nothing to do with the former premier or Tariq Shafi.
A division bench comprising Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri issued a detailed decision rejecting the petition for the cancellation of Imran’s bail.
The court said no proof was provided that the funds sent by Arif Naqvi from abroad were from black money. The allegations levelled in the first information report (FIR) by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) had no connection with Imran Khan or Tariq Shafi.
The order said Imran Khan had not signed any bank document. As per the FIR, either Arif Naqvi had given a false affidavit or the bank officials had not given a transaction report. Moreover, the State Bank of Pakistan had neither inquired into the matter nor it had declared any transaction as unlawful.
The court said one allegation was to convert the PTI’s account into the title of ‘Nia Pakistan’ but it was not an illegal act. The investigation officer of the case had also not recorded the statement of SBP officials.
The FIA could not satisfy the bench to cancel the bail of Imran Khan, it said.
The banking court had stated that the arrest was not compulsory in the case as all evidence was based on documents, the court added.
The FIA had registered an FIR against Imran Khan under Foreign Exchange Act after the decision of ECP in the prohibited funding case.

7,SC's Punjab polls ruling: Harbinger of judicial war?,CJP could not evolve a strategy to end the perception that only some judges are interested to hold elections in Punjab,"Despite facing legal impediments put by one section of the Supreme Court judges, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial and two “like-minded” judges have emerged “victorious” by announcing the date for elections in Punjab Assembly.
The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) is as jubilant over the SC's decision as the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) parties were in April last year when the court had quashed a ruling of National Assembly’s deputy speaker and directed then NA speaker to complete the process of no confidence against former prime minister Imran Khan as per a schedule given by the court itself.
Even the PTI had severally criticized these judges at that time.
Commenting on Tuesday's verdict, PTI’s Lawyer Maleeka Bukhari said the order is a ray of hope during the rule of “an autocratic regime mired in illegalities and worst human rights violations”.
""I want to pay tribute to the honorable judges of the Supreme Court, in particular the honorable CJP. Despite personal attacks, humiliating propaganda and threats the honorable judges showed immense strength and integrity.
“They have emerged as the true defenders of the Constitution.
“The honorable judges defended the Constitution of Pakistan and the fundamental right of Pakistanis to cast their vote without fear or coercion. Today’s order is a win for the people of Pakistan and an important step in strengthening democracy,"" she said.
However, CJP Bandial could not evolve a strategy to end the perception that only some particular judges are interested to hold elections in Punjab.
""When a judicial history is written, today's judgment will be seen as the beginning of a judicial civil war in the Supreme Court,” said renowned lawyer Faisal Siddiqi.
Two SC judges—Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi—on February 16 requested CJP Bandial to take suo motu notice of delay in announcement of polls in Punjab while hearing a service matter.
Subsequently, the CJP had started suo motu proceedings by forming a nine-judge bench to hear the matter despite the fact that the same matter had been pending in the Lahore High Court (LHC).
Interestingly, the CJP did not include two senior most judges—Justice Qazi Faez Isa and Justice Sardar Tariq Masood—in the bench that he was himself leading.
After judicial notes of some judges, CJP Bandial reconstituted a five judge larger bench to hear the matter. According to Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Naqvi had recused themselves from hearing the matter.
Two more judges, who held that the suo motu case was unjustified, were also excluded from the bench.
Now questions are being raised as to how Justice Ahsan could hear the matter which he had earlier decided not to hear. However, CJP Bandial says there is nothing on record that Justice Ahsan had recused himself.
It is said that one group of judges has consistently adjudicated political cases during CJP Bandial's tenure. Some judges have even raised their voices in their judicial orders, calling for regulating the CJP’s powers to form benches and fix cases.
Though the Supreme Court is being appreciated for compelling the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and other executive authorities to hold elections in Punjab within 90 days, serious legal issues have not been resolved due to lack of due process.
Firstly, the SC invoked suo motu jurisdiction in a matter which was already pending in the LHC. Even four judges declared that suo motu notice was unjustified as the same issue was being heard by the LHC.
Instead of issuing an order of the court to end the controversy about the judgment, CJP Bandial and two like-minded judges held that the opinion of Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail was “erroneous”.
Questions have also arisen over whether these three judges can resolve the controversy about non issuance of the order of the court by holding in a fresh case that the two judges’ opinion is in minority.
In the present circumstances, Justice Athar Minallah's detailed opinion will be crucial to ascertain as to whether the suo motu case was dismissed by a vote of 4 to 3 or was upheld by a vote of 3 to 2.
The division in the apex court may further widen after a six-judge larger bench on Tuesday held that the judicial order of Justice Qazi Faez Isa and Justice Aminuddin Khan was ineffective.
Both the judges held that hearing of all cases under Article 184 (3) of Constitution be postponed until amendments in the SC Rules 1980 about discretionary powers of the CJP to form special benches.
Whether a sub judice matter can be transferred from one bench to another for getting favourable results?  This precedent will undermine the independence of judges and will strengthen the unfettered powers of the CJP to manipulate benches.
Now the question is: whether a larger bench can review a judicial order without including the author judge and signatory judge? Questions are being raised about the composition of the larger bench in which judges belonging to a particular section were included.
Some legal minds ask as to what will be the legitimacy of the court proceeding if the CJP includes only like-minded judges in a bench. It is learnt that the federal government is waiting for the president to sign on a new piece of legislation regarding the CJP discretionary powers.
 The government will move an appeal against Tuesday's judgment once this proposed legislation becomes an act. A senior government official said it seems the bench has passed the order keeping in mind the time needed to make the legislation effective.
Legal expert Reema Omer said the CJP’s “arbitrary, dictatorial management of the SC and mockery of his dissenting peers” show that independence and impartiality of the judiciary are being compromised.
""If we are truly standing with the Constitution then we cannot turn a blind eye to such blatant abuse of power,"" she added.
Former Sindh High Court Bar Association president Salahuddin Ahmed said the SC judgment is to be viewed on two levels: the merits of its findings and the process of reaching those findings.
""As far as the merits are concerned; the only thing surprising about the judgment is the fact that no directions were given in relation to elections in the K-P on the pretext that the advocate for the KP governor had withdrawn representation.
“Surely, withdrawal of vakalatnama by an advocate could not be grounds to delay the right to vote for a province of 35 million people. After all, the Constitution is equally applicable to the K-P as it is to Punjab.
“If it was necessary to hear the K-P governor, the skies would not have fallen if a joint decision regarding both provinces was rendered a day or two later.
“Instead, the part of the judgment that holds – as far as funds are concerned – that they will be utilized for Punjab first and thereafter any leftover shall be used for elections in the K-P is likely to create severe resentments besides being discriminatory and constitutionally suspect,"" he said.
""This brings us to the process of reaching the judgment. The haste in which the case was heard; the refusal to hold a full court hearing despite pleas by various parties and no objection by the petitioners and the manner in which a bench of nine was whittled down to three  naturally gives rise to suspicions
“It creates the impression that the existing bench was unwilling to countenance a contrary view from any quarter. Had this matter been decided by a full court no matter with what division, it would have finally laid the matter to rest.
“Instead, the manner in which the case was heard will give the government an excuse to avoid elections. It will prolong the present uncertainty,"" he added.

8,Lawmakers demand justice for Bhutto; slam SC verdict,Term April 4 ‘darkest day’ of country’s judiciary,"The National Assembly on Tuesday echoed with tributes to PPP founder and former premier Zulfikar Ali Bhutto on the occasion of his anniversary of his “judicial murder” as well as the lawmakers condemning the bench of the Supreme Court judges that earlier in the day “killed” the Constitution by fixing May 14 as the date for the elections in Punjab after rejecting the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) decision to hold them in October.
They termed April 4 as the “darkest day” in the history of the country’s judiciary on which both the PPP founder and the Constitution were “murdered”.
Climate Change Minister Sherry Rehman, while taking the floor of the House, maintained that another judicial murder had been committed on April 4 -- first that of Bhutto and now the Constitution.
She demanded that action should be taken against the judicial murder of Bhutto through a presidential reference.
Sherry continued that they did not wish a clash with another institution but the court should have realised that it was the date when Bhutto had embraced martyrdom.
She alleged that the SC judges, who announced the verdict earlier in the day, were looking after the interests of their “favourite”, an indirect reference to PTI chief Imran Khan.
The PPP lawmaker claimed that the decision of the minority had been imposed on the majority and there was a price to pay for such verdicts.
Railways Minister Khawaja Saad Rafique, who belongs the PML-N, pointing out that Bhutto had been subjected to judicial murder, claimed that later two premiers, Yousuf Raza Gilani of the PPP and Nawaz Sharif, his party's supremo, were “unjustly” punished by the courts.
He noted that his party had stepped out for the restoration of the judiciary during former military dictator Gen (retd) Pervez Musharraf’s time.
“Nawaz Sharif stepped out even though he was receiving threatening phone calls. It was only because we believed what Musharraf was doing was wrong,” he added.
“Now that the courts are delivering verdicts based on the doctrine of necessity, our heads hang in shame,” the PML-N leader continued.
Rafique pointed out that senior politician Javed Hashmi had predicted that generals and judges would eventually be on one side.
“Today, we see his prediction coming true,” he added.
He reiterated his demand for the formation of a full court to hear the matter.
He maintained that if elections were held earlier in Punjab than the rest of the country, it would affect the polls in the rest of the provinces.
 “They [PTI] are insisting that the polls in Punjab be held on the basis of the previous census. What guarantees are there that the results of these elections would be acceptable to all?” he raised the question.
Opposition leader in the NA Raja Riaz, while echoing the sentiments of the treasury members, declared the verdict of the SC as a”dark” one.
He added that SC judges had appeased their “favourite”, who had destroyed the country for four years, instead of listening to the people of Pakistan.
He maintained that the SC judgment was based on ego instead of a full court that was being demanded.
Riaz added that Bhutto was “murdered” on April 4 and now the Constitution he had delivered was subjected to the same fate.
The SC bench has delivered a judgment that is neither acceptable to other top court judges, nor the people or political parties.
PPP MNAs Nawabzada Iftikhar Ahmed Khan Babar, Ramesh Kumar, Syed Agha Rafiullah as well as others lawmakers of the party paid rich tributes to Bhutto in the House, describing him as the voice for the common man and demanding justice for his “judicial killing”.
PML-N's Sheikh Rohale Asghar and JUI-F’s Shahida Akhtar were also the MNAs, who acknowledged Bhutto’s mission to unite the Muslims around the world.
JUI-F’s Maulana Asad Mahmood, son of Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), while addressing the three SC judges, who handed down the verdict, said they had held the “funeral of justice and the Constitution” and they would never achieve peace.
He pledged to not allow the implementation of the judgment and fight till the very end.
The son of the JUI-F chief also vowed to stand by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the Constitution, and parliament.
PTI MNA Ahmed Hussain Deharr conceded that Bhutto was subjected to injustice as well as stressed upon the need for the ruling coalition and his party to sign a charter of economy that would last for 10 years.
He added that elections could not be held in the prevailing situation.
However, PTI MNA Muhammad Mohsin Khan Leghari disagreed with the other members, insisting that the SC verdict was in line with the Constitution.
He maintained that the SC judgment had “buried” the doctrine of necessity.
Leghari also regretted the attitude of the other lawmakers in the lower house of parliament.
He added that the lawmakers had turned the NA into a “fish market” through their “double-meaning” statements.

9,UK minister’s remarks ‘misleading’: FO,"Spokesperson says home secretary fails to take note of systemic racism, ghettoisation of communities"," 
Pakistan on Wednesday took exception to the remarks made by a British minister, singling out British-Pakistani men that their cultural values were at odds with the British values.
Speaking at the weekly news briefing, Foreign Office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch termed Suella Braverman’s remarks as a “misleading picture signalling the intent to target and treat British-Pakistanis differently”.
Braverman came under fire for comments regarding British-Pakistani men. The home secretary during an interview with Sky News had said that British-Pakistani men “hold cultural values at odds with British values”.
The UK minister was talking about plans to tackle child abuse when she singled out British-Pakistani men and said: “White English girls, sometimes in care, sometimes who are in challenging circumstances, being pursued and raped and drugged and harmed by gangs of British-Pakistani men who’ve worked in child abuse rings or networks.”
But the spokesperson, the British home secretary had “erroneously branded criminal behaviour of some individuals as a representation of the entire community”.
""We find these remarks as dangerous, discriminatory, and xenophobic,"" she said.
""Her statement paints a highly misleading picture, signalling the intent to target and treat British Pakistanis differently. In making these uncalled-for remarks, the home secretary has erroneously branded the criminal behaviour of some individuals as a representation of the entire community.""
“She fails to take note of the systemic racism and ghettoisation of communities and omits to recognise the tremendous cultural, economic and political contributions that British-Pakistanis continue to make in British society,” Baloch added.
Violence against Muslims in India
Meanwhile, the spokesperson expressed deep concerns over the rising incidents of violence against Muslims in India.
“On this Ram Navami, anti-Muslim violence was reported in at least eight states of India as extremist outfits organised public rallies to celebrate the festival. A number of mosques and other Muslim-owned buildings were attacked. A seminary was burned down in Nalanda district of Bihar, resulting, inter alia, in the burning of around 4500 books, including Holy the Quran,” she told reporters.
“The terrifying rise in Islamophobic and hateful acts against Muslims in India is a consequence of the pursuit of a majoritarian Hindutva agenda and anti-Islam and anti-Muslim rhetoric rife in Indian politics,” the spokesperson added.
She welcomed the statement of OIC expressing its concern on rising anti-Muslim incidents in India and urge India to take firm action against the extremists for fomenting communal violence and hatred against Muslims.
India must take demonstrable steps to curb the rising tide of Islamophobia, to provide protection to Muslims for practising their faith and account for those responsible for such hateful acts.
“We reiterate our concerns about the safety and wellbeing of Kashmiri leaders and human rights defenders who are under incarceration in prisons across IIOJK and India.”
