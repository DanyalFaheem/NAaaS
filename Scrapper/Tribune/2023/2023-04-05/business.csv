0,Legislation demanded for tobacco retailing,Tobacco retailer licensing has been recommended as an effective tobacco control strategy worldwide,"Provincial Alliance for Sustainable Tobacco Control on Tuesday demanded legislative actions around tobacco retail licensing for effective compliance with other tobacco control measures in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.
Addressing a press conference in Peshawar Press Club, the speakers called for the adoption of provincial legislation to regulate the sale of tobacco products in the province.
Earlier, the West Pakistan Tobacco Vend Act, 1958 was repealed in K-P under the influence of the tobacco industry in 2010. The re-enactment and well enforcement of tobacco vendor licensing policies can encourage vendors to comply with existing tobacco control regulations.
The speakers said that tobacco use is a leading cause of preventable deaths worldwide, with more than eight million people dying each year due to tobacco-related illnesses. In Pakistan, tobacco use is responsible for a significant number of deaths, with an estimated 160,000 deaths per year attributed to tobacco-related illnesses.
According to civil society organizations, tobacco retailer licensing has been recommended as an effective tobacco control strategy worldwide.
Adopting tobacco retailer licensing laws can be contributing way to ensure compliance with tobacco laws and to combat public health problems.

1,Traffic warden dies in Dir Lower ambush,Terrorist killed in Dera Ismail Khan IBO,"A traffic warden was gunned down by unidentified miscreants in a crowded marketplace in Dir Lower district of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) on Tuesday afternoon.
Separately, a terrorist was killed in a raid in DI Khan.
Police told The Express Tribune that Bakhat Zameen was posted in traffic police for a long time and he was currently deployed in Talash Bazaar.
“He was on duty in the crowded marketplace in the afternoon when unidentified terrorists opened fire at him, killing him on the spot,” said a police official, adding that the attackers managed to escape.
Local residents rushed him to hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival. As per the initial information, the attackers were riding a motorcycle. 
“Police reached the site of the attack and started a door-to-door search operation but there was no sign of any suspect involved in the attack,” he said.
Soon after the incident, highly enraged family members and local residents staged a protest against the attack in Talash Bazaar by blocking the GT Road for all kind of vehicular traffic. As a result long lines of vehicles could be seen on both sides of the key artery.
They demanded an end to terrorism in the area and urged police to arrest those responsible for the deadly attack in a marketplace in broad daylight.
The protesters, however, dispersed peacefully after district administration and police officials held negotiations with them. The traffic jam continued even after the end of the protest and sit-in in the market.
The last rites of the slain traffic warden were offered in Dir Police Lines with full guard of honour following which the dead body was sent to the deceased’s ancestral town for burial.
It may be mentioned here that two policemen, who had been deployed outside a mosque in Kohat, were shot dead last night.
Police said they were guarding the mosque during Taraveeh prayers when attacked.
The deadly attack caused widespread panic among the local residents in Kohat.
In DI Khan district, a terrorist was killed and two others were injured in an intelligence based operation (IBO). A policeman was also injured in the raid.
In the Kot Easa area of Daraban police station in DI Khan, police and security forces raided a house where terrorists were holed up.
They were asked to surrender but the terrorists opened fire at the raiding party.
In the ensuing exchange of fire, a terrorist was killed who has been identified as Ansar, resident of Kot Easa. Two others were injured who managed to escape.
A police constable Ilyas Khan was also injured in the firefight who has been hospitalized where his condition is stated to be critical.
Militancy has been on the rise since the fall of Kabul to Taliban after the withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan.

2,Right to information eludes Balochistan,This delay is a violation of the law and undermines the purpose of the Balochistan Right to Information Act,"The Centre for Peace and Development Initiatives (CPDI) has called upon the Chief Minister of Balochistan to appoint members of the Balochistan Information Commission, as required by the Balochistan Right to Information Act, 2021.
In a statement issued here, the CPDI emphasized that the establishment of the Information Commission is critical for promoting transparency and accountability in the government.
The Balochistan Right to Information Act was passed by the provincial assembly on February 1, 2021, and received the assent of the governor of Balochistan on February 15, 2021.
The Act mandates the Balochistan government to appoint members of the Information Commission within 180 days of the commencement of the Act under Section 18(1).
However, despite this legal obligation, it has been more than two years since the passage of this Act, and members of the Commission have not been appointed. This delay is a violation of the law and undermines the purpose of the Balochistan Right to Information Act.

3,Dog-bites on the wane in Peshawar,Canine neutering drive helps decrease dog attack cases,"The initiative of neutering stray dogs with the objective of controlling their population and containing the deadly zoonotic disease of rabies has shown encouraging results.
The project has resulted in the reduction of canine bites by more than 50 percent in the provincial metropolis.
Now castration of stray dogs will start in Mardan, Swat, Kohat, Bannu, Abbotabad and DI Khan, a senior official said.
The three-year record of Lady Reading Hospital (LRH), the largest healthcare facility of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), has shown that since the inception of dog neutering campaign in Peshawar, the dog-bite cases have been drastically reduced to a figure of 3,459 in 2021 from a high of 8,732 in 2019.
In 2020, 5,394 dog-bite cases were reported to the hospital.
“Decrease in dog-bite cases is an indication of a reduction in the population of stray dogs and achievement of the objective for which the project was launched in Peshawar in the year 2019,” said Project Director Dr Masoom Ali Shah.
The drive was introduced in Peshawar as a replication of WHO recommended programme of trap-neuter-vaccinate-return (TNVR) to control rabies and overpopulation of street dogs, Dr Mosoom explained.
The initiative was a pilot project and after evaluation of its encouraging results, the livestock and dairy development department of K-P has decided its extension to all the divisional headquarters of the province, he observed.
The project helped in reducing infection of deadly rabies disease from 8,000 cases to 3,000 during that period at LRH, he claimed. 
Apart from achieving positive results with regard to public health, the TNVR drive also helped in transition of rabies control policy from cruel practice of dog culling to neutering the animal, he added.
During the TNVR initiative, livestock department established a state-of-the-art operation theater in Peshawar having the capacity of operating upon several dogs on a daily basis.
Before releasing the dog in the open after operation, a collar fitted with reflectors is fixed around its neck and a tattoo is printed on ear as a mark of identity that the dog is already operated upon, he told APP.
During the neutering procedure, the dog is also vaccinated against rabies. In case a dog is found to be rabid, the animal is euthanized in the interest of public safety.
The project to increase the availability of dog neutering services in K-P is estimated to cost approximately Rs40.7 million, but funding approval is still pending before work can commence, he added
Meanwhile, Pakistan Animal Rights Advocacy Group (PARAG), an association of civil and animal right activists, has appreciated transition of anti-rabies control programme from dog culling to neutering.
“That is indeed the right direction for containing rabies and population of stray dogs as recommended by WHO,” observed Dr Ayeza Haider, Chairman PARAG.
Talking to APP, Dr Ayeza said that Punjab province has also formulated a new policy in line with the WHO recommended TNVR approach.
The implementation of the policy in the whole country is needed to ensure prevention of cruelty against animals, she stressed.

4,"UoP VC, PUTA asked to submit replies",Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim questioned the reason behind teachers’ protest and boycott of classes,"Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim of Peshawar High Court (PHC) has said that unnecessary strikes of lawyers have been banned by the court and there was no reason for university teachers to go on strike.
PHC on Tuesday issued notices to the Vice Chancellor (VC) University of Peshawar (UoP) and the Peshawar University Teachers’ Association (PUTA) over the boycott of classes. The two-member bench, comprising Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Justice SM Attiq Shah, while hearing the case filed by Jamiat Talba Islami against teachers’ protest at UoP expressed shock over the suspension of classes for a month.
The petitioners’ lawyer, Advocate Farooq Malik, informed the court that more than a month had passed since the teachers of the biggest university in the province were on a protest and had boycotted the classes. He said precious time of the students was being wasted due to the prolonged strike and their future was at stake as no party was showing flexibility to resolve the issue. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim questioned the reason behind teachers’ protest and boycott of classes.
Advocate Farooq informed the bench that the teachers were demanding the resignation of the VC in the wake of the killing of a security supervisor by a security guard on the university campus.
