1,‘Murderer’ killed in ‘encounter’,"The suspect, Afzal, was accused of slaughtering two persons","A man, Afzal, was killed in an alleged police encounter. 
The suspect was accused of killing a man and a boy by slitting their throats.
However, no further details about how and where the police encounter took police in which the suspect died could be known.
Meanwhile, Burewala was in the grip of a shock when the people of the district learnt about the double murder that took place the other night and which was said to be the doing of Afzal.
Afzal allegedly killed two people, one of them being only 14-years-old, in a tailor’s shop by slitting their throats. 
Nazir Ahmed, 65, owned an embroidery shop adjacent to an old factory near Mana Mor in Gaggoo Mandi. 
Inundated by customers’ orders and the compulsion to meet the deadlines, Nazir got so exhausted that he decided to sleep in the shop last night along with his 14-year-old trainee, Faheem. 
They never woke up.
When the shop didn’t open at its usual time people in the market became curious. As time went by, their curiosity turned into fright.
Ultimately the shutter of the shop was broken and the bodies of Nazir and Faheem were found soaked in blood. 
The horrified people informed the police who reached the spot and shifted the bodies to the THQ Hospital for postmortem. 
They collected evidence from the crime scene.
A son of late Nazir had told the police that Muhammad Afzal owed his father Rs60,000. Afzal was a resident of the same village. However, Afzal had not been returning the loan, and the matter had come to a pass. 
Nazir’s son surmised that Afzal had been behind the murder of his father and the boy.
Deaths of accused in police custody is not uncommon in Punjab. In December last year, a young man died allegedly after being subjected to torture by police, prompting his relatives to stage a protest demonstration and move an application for registration of a case against police officials in Vehari.
Taking notice of the incident, the DPO of Vehari ordered SP investigations Rubina Abbas to take the body of the deceased, identified as Imran Baloch, into custody.

4,Waste compost plan launched,Fertiliser production started from garbage of four union councils,"Work has been started on a waste compost plan for the city by separating the garbage of different kinds and using it for producing fertiliser and other gainful purposes.
According to Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC) officials, the organisation collects about 5,500 tonnes of garbage daily from more than 6,000 containers lying in the streets. The garbage is take to 17 temporary and five big waste centres set up in different areas of the city.
Garbage is then transfered to the Lakhodair dumping side.
All the items in the garbage are dumped without segregation and due to lack of proper planning, gases emanating from the garbage threaten the environment and public health, the officials said.
The LWMC has now started work on the project of sorting the garbage. 
Initially, the Moon Market in Gulshan Ravi has been included in the project along with some union councils covering the GOR area.
It is estimated that 300 tonnes of garbage is collected daily from the area.
The LWMC has signed an agreement with a private organisation that will separate iron, plastic, paper, including tree leaves and grass from the garbage and sell them.
A process of producing natural fertiliser has also been started under the Green Line Waste Compost Plan.
Initially, production of 70 tonnes of fertiliser from the garbage has been started.
A 5kg pack of the fertiliser is being sold for Rs230.
The LWMC has applied for a certificate from the agriculture department for the sale of fertiliser so that it may be better marketed.
As the project succeeds, the garbage collected from other parts of the city would be included in it, LWMC Chief Executive Officer Sahib Deen told The Express Tribune.
Initial reports indicate that about 75 per cent of the 300 tonnes of garbage collected from four Union councils daily is being utilised for various purposes, while the remaining 25% reaches the dumping point. 
It is estimated that if work on the project starts across the city, more than 4,000 tonnes of garbage will be useful, while only 1,500 tonnes will be deposited at the dumping point.
The LWMC officials said about 1,200 vehicles are working in Lahore to carry the garbage to the dumping point, on which billions of rupees are spent annually. 
Starting fertiliser production from garbage will not only help meet the waste disposal expenses expenses on the one hand, the expenses but also become a source of income.
Under the LWMC Green Line Waste Compost Plan, work is also under way in Gawala Colony in Harbanspura, where there are thousands of buffaloes, to utilise about 1,000 tonnes of dung produced by them daily that was previously dumped into sewers, canals and roads.
Negotiations have been started with private companies to collect the animal waste from the Gawala Colony to produce fertiliser
The LWMC CEO said if the waste collected from the city is used to produce fertiliser and as fuel in cement industries, the garbage will be removed from the city and revenue will also be earned.
He said work had initially been started on the project to collect and separate the garbage from four union councils to make is usable, which is showing good results. 
Other areas of the city will also be included in the project, while animal waste from the Gawala Colony will also be utilised from profitable purposes, he added.
