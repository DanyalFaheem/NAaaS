0,‘Historic verdict' puts PTI into celebratory mode,Imran's party says SC has upheld supremacy of the Constitution,"The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has hailed the Supreme Court of Pakistan’s “historic” verdict which has “buried"" the Doctrine of Necessity for good.
The party swung into celebratory mode after a three-judge apex court bench on Tuesday accepted its constitutional petition and ordered the country’s polls supervisory authority – the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) – to hold elections in Punjab on May 14.
Talking to the media, the party’s vice chairman, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, described the day as momentous.
 “Today, the country’s top court has buried the Doctrine of Necessity for good. We are proud that the nation still has people who can deliver verdicts based on the Constitution and conscience,” he said.
He said the apex court has thwarted an attempt by the ruling coalition to trample the Constitution under its feet. “Today, the verdict has drawn a line between the constitutional and democratic forces and unconstitutional and undemocratic forces in the country.”
The PTI senior leader also congratulated the legal fraternity for standing by the Constitution.
Also congratulating the chief election commissioner (CEC), Qureshi said now the ECP is unshackled from the restriction imposed by the government.
He asked the PTI workers and supporters to prepare for elections and to get PTI Chairman Imran Khan elected as the prime minister once again.
Commenting on the verdict, PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry said the entire nation stood by the apex court. “Elections will bring stability to the country,” he said.

He said state institutions are bound to conduct elections within 90 days of the dissolution of an assembly. However, the government is trying to run away from elections.
Chaudhry said all judges of the country agree that elections can be deferred only in case of imposition of martial law. “Today, the armed forces of the country stand behind the SC verdict,” he said.
Taking a dig at Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, who also serves as the foreign minister in the cabinet of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, he said the grandson of PPP founder Zulfikar Ali Bhutto is now siding with people who violate the Constitution. Bhutto, who was executed on April 4, 1979, is regarded as the architect of the country’s 1973 Constitution.
Chaudhry urged Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supreme leader Nawaz Sharif and PPP Co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari to accept the SC’s decision and hold elections in the country “as only fresh elections can bring stability.”
PTI leader Hammad Azhar said the Supreme Court had upheld the Constitution.
“No other verdict was possible under the law and the Constitution,” he said, adding that political parties do not run away from elections.
Faisal Javed Khan also hailed the “historic” verdict. He said the government is trapped in a blind alley and has no option but to hold elections. He urged the government to dissolve the National Assembly as well within 24 hours.

1,Govt hardens position on SC election verdict,Announces it will bring resolution in NA against top court’s decision," 
A day after the Supreme Court ruled that election in Punjab be held on May 14, the ruling coalition on Wednesday took a hardening stance, saying “people should know the way the Constitution and law was being mocked”, and announced it will bring a resolution against the verdict in the National Assembly on Thursday (today).
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif chaired a huddle of the allied parties in the federal capital to mull over the constitutional and legal aspects in the wake of the apex court’s decision and craft a strategy in this regard.
The Supreme Court on Tuesday declared as “unconstitutional” the Election Commission of Pakistan’s decision to postpone polls in Punjab, citing security concerns and the economic crisis.
The three-member bench — headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial and comprising Justice Munib Akhtar and Justice Ijazul Ahsan —fixed May 14 as the date for the poll in the province.
Regarding elections in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, the top court ordered that the relevant forum be approached.
On March 22, the election supervisor had delayed the provincial assembly election in the politically crucial Punjab province by more than five months, citing the deteriorating security situation in the cash-starved country.

PTI chief Imran Khan had dissolved the Punjab and K-P assemblies in January this year in a bid to force the government to hold snap elections.
During the meeting, the PM Shehbaz welcomed all the parties’ leaders including PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif, PPP Co-Chairperson Asif Zardari and JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman.
He said with the recent decisions of the apex court, a “mockery was being made with the Constitution and laws of the country”.
“Fate of the nation is being decided with strange decisions,” the premier said.
The premier noted that such “treatment” with the Constitution and law was never witnessed before, adding that ""such a terrible scene has never met eyes"".
The huddle mulled over tabling a resolution against the top court’s verdict in the National Assembly on Thursday (today).
The prime minister regretted that the SC bench had not made the political parties respondent in the case.
He said the three-member bench had rejected the appeal for the constitution of a full bench and similarly, political parties' requests were also rejected.
The premier elaborated that last week they held a detailed meeting, which was followed by two cabinet meetings and parliamentary sessions over the evolving situation.
“How a decision of another bench was neglected while members of the three-judge bench who had earlier recused themselves again joined it,” he questioned while referring to the inclusion of Justice Ijazul Ahsan in the bench.

Two apex court judges—Justice Ahsan and Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi—on February 16 had requested Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial to take suo motu notice of delay in announcement of polls in Punjab while hearing a service matter.
Subsequently, the CJP had started suo motu proceedings by forming a nine-judge bench to hear the matter despite the fact that the same matter had been pending in the Lahore High Court.
After judicial notes of some judges, CJP Bandial reconstituted a five judge larger bench to hear the matter. According to Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Ahsan and Justice Naqvi had recused themselves from hearing the matter.
Two more judges, who held that the suo motu case was unjustified, were also excluded from the bench.
Now questions were being raised as to how Justice Ahsan could hear the matter which he had earlier decided not to hear. However, CJP said there was nothing on record that Justice Ahsan had recused himself.
During the allied parties meeting, PM Shehbaz said that the “4-3” order of the apex court was not accepted.
Earlier, two SC judges, Justice Mansoor and Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, in their detailed order had observed that the suo motu case in connection with the announcement of the election date was dismissed by 4-3.
Later during the hearing, Justice Mandokhail noted that the order of the court in the case was not issued by the CJP.
The premier lamented that a six-member Supreme Court bench had recalled the interim order authored by Justice Qazi Faez Isa, wherein postponement of suo motu cases was ordered till amendments were made in the SC Rules, 1980 regarding the discretionary powers of the chief justice to form benches.
A circular was issued over Justice Isa's directive, followed by the formation of a six-member bench that took up the issue and decided it, PM Shehbaz said.
On Tuesday, PM Shehbaz, while speaking in the lower house of parliament, did not hesitate in equating the top court verdict with the “judicial murder” of the late premier Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, pointing out that both had happened on April 4 – the day the PPP founder was hanged.

2,ECP sets Punjab poll process in motion,Commission notifies schedule for provincial assembly in line with SC ruling,"The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has set the election process in motion to the Punjab Assembly that was put off on March 22 after the poll supervisor postponed it on the pretext of security issues and the economic crisis.
A day earlier, the Supreme Court had not only declared as “unconstitutional” the ECP decision but also set May 14 as the new date for the poll in the province, in a blow to the government that was seen dragging it feet from the provincial election.
The verdict was announced by a three-member bench headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial and comprising Justice Munib Akhtar and Justice Ijazul Ahsan.
On Wednesday, the ECP notified the schedule for the election to the Punjab Assembly in line with the Supreme Court order.

The revised schedule was announced during an emergency meeting chaired by Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja to take stock of the situation following the top court order in a petition filed by the PTI against the ECP’s decision to delay the Punjab Assembly elections from the originally decided date of April 30 to October 8.
As per the notification, polling for the election in Punjab will be held on May 14. The last date for filing appeal against the decision of the returning officer regarding the nomination papers will be April 10.
“The ECP hereby recalls its notification of even number dated March 22 2023 and in partial modification to this commission’s notification of March 8 2023 hereby revises following stages of election programme for the conduct of general elections to the provincial assembly of Punjab,” stated the revised notification.
As per the revised schedule, the election tribunal will decide on the appeals by April 17, and the last date for publishing the new list of candidates will be April 18.

The last date for withdrawal of nomination papers will be April 19 and election symbols will be allotted to the candidates on April 20.
The election schedule by the ECP comes just a day after the apex court declared as “unconstitutional” the ECP’s earlier decision to postpone elections in Punjab, in a blow to the government that has been trying to delay the provincial election citing security issues and the economic crisis.
The three-member bench — headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial and comprising Justice Munib Akhtar and Justice Ijazul Ahsan — also fixed May 14 as the date for the poll in the province.
On March 22, the ECP had delayed the provincial assembly election in the politically crucial Punjab province by more than five months, citing the deteriorating security situation in the cash-starved country, a move criticised by Imran.
Following the ECP’s announcement, the PTI on March 25 approached the SC against the electoral watchdog’s decision to delay elections in Punjab.
The hearings in the case, which lasted over a week, witnessed high drama after two judges of the original five-member bench — Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Aminuddin Khan — recused themselves from hearing the case. Thereafter, the chief justice constituted a bench comprising himself, Justice Ahsan and Justice Akhtar to proceed with the PTI petition.
