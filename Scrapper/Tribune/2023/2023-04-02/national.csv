0,Debt sustainability indicators worsen,Finance Ministry report reveals external public debt rose significantly in the past six months,"Pakistan’s major debt sustainability indicators have witnessed marked deterioration during the first half of this fiscal year in the middle of steep currency devaluation and interest rates hikes, revealed a semi-annual debt bulletin of the finance ministry.
The July-December 2022 report showed that the share of external public debt rose in the past six months, while the average time of maturity and period of resetting the interest rates have further shortened.
This is synchronous with interest rates at historic highs and the currency devaluing by 56% since the incumbent government came into power a year ago.
The report showed that the share of external debt in the total public debt rose from 37% in June to 37.2% by December, heightening the currency risks simultaneously with the rupee sinking and foreign countries shying away from extending loans. The debt office publishes semi-annual debt bulletin containing information about debt stocks, debt operations and the sources of change in the debt stocks on semi-annual basis.
According to the report, “Large external payments in the wake of low foreign exchange reserves can pose liquidity problems and even destabilise the exchange rate which in turn, can increase the burden of external loans measured in local currency.”
Although the government is not inclined towards debt restructuring, worsening indicators coupled with a lack of adequate foreign funding suggest that Pakistan will soon have to embrace this path.
According to the debt bulletin, in dollar terms, Pakistan’s total public debt stood at $233 billion by December, including $86.6 billion external public debt. The country needs to service 28% of its debt in just one year, which is quite a big chunk and will expose the nation to all types of debt related risks.
The floating rate domestic debt is now Rs22.5 trillion or 68% of domestic debt, which is poisonous due to interest rates at a record 20%.
In rupee terms, public debt jumped to Rs52.7 trillion – an addition of Rs3.6 trillion during the first half of the fiscal year. The rupee depreciation added Rs2.3 trillion to public debt in six months, contributing a rise of 63% to debt during this period. The interest expenses amounted to Rs2.27 trillion during the first half of the fiscal year, equal to 72% of the surge in public debt during this period.
Some of the increases were offset by the withdrawing the cash balances with the banks and primary surplus.
The finance ministry stated that containing exposure to external debt is important to manage the exchange rate risk. “The depreciation of the rupee over the last four years against international currencies has resulted in a higher value of external debt when translated into local currency.”
The report also showed that average time of maturity of the domestic loan reduced from four years to three and half years in one year. This, too, was riskier and would keep the country dependent on commercial banks out to exploit the situation.
“Given the prevailing interest rate environment, the demand for domestic debt remained mostly skewed towards short to medium-term government securities,” said the report.
The average time of maturity of the external debt also dipped from an already low level of six years and seven months to just six years and three months. It is even lower than the minimum threshold, causing refinancing risks that has kept the country at the mercy of foreign creditors. 
Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said on Friday that the country should learn to live with or without the IMF – a remark that has created confusion about the government’s intentions towards reviving the derailed $6.5 billion bailout package.
The finance ministry said that due to the short tenure of foreign commercial bank loans and deposits from friendly countries, there was reduction in the average-time-to-maturity of external debt.
The Average Time to Refix (ATR) domestic debt also reduced to one year and seven months at the end of December 2022 as compared to one year and nine months a year earlier, according to the report. This reduction in ATR was due to a strong market appetite for floating rate debt instruments owing to the prevailing interest rate environment, it added.
A drop in the ATR means that the finance ministry has to rest the interest rate for the debt stock, which makes the government vulnerable to interest rate hikes.
Besides, the ATR of external debt also shrank to five years and three months by end-December 2022 from five years and seven months a year ago due to higher proportions of floating rate external debt inflows, running off of the existing fixed rate external debt portfolio; and higher proportion of fixed rate external debt maturing within short to medium term, it added.
In yet another significant deterioration, the fixed rate debt reduced from 26% to just 22.6% of the domestic debt, increasing the interest rate risks. This is coming at a time when the central bank is going to significantly raise interest rates.
A total Rs17.1 trillion or 52% of government debt is held by commercial banks, now a source of exploitation and, despite exchange rate manipulation, the government seems unable to impose penalties on some of these banks. Roughly, Rs15 trillion or 28% of the total debt will mature in one year, which has to be refinanced. This includes a portion of external debt.
The share of floating interest rate domestic debt increased from 62% to 68%. Of the Rs33.1 trillion domestic debt as of December 2022, a sum of Rs22.6 trillion had been borrowed on floating interest rates.
In March, inflation soared to 35.6% and the share of the floating rate debt will also substantially increase the already overflowing cost of debt servicing.
The only positive indicator was the share of Shariah compliant debt in the government securities which increased from 6.4% to 9.2% in the last calendar year.

2,US unveils stricter EV tax credit rules,Aims to reduce US dependence on China for EV battery supply chains starting April 18,"The US Treasury Department unveiled stricter electric vehicle tax rules on Friday, that will reduce or remove tax credits on some zero-emission models but grant buyers another two weeks before the new requirements take effect.
The rules are aimed at weaning the US off dependence on China for EV battery supply chains and are part of President Joe Biden’s effort to make 50% of US new vehicle sales by 2030 EVs or plug-in hybrids.
The EV battery sourcing guidance issued triggers new requirements for critical minerals and battery components and takes effect for vehicle purchases starting April 18.
US officials acknowledged some vehicles will see credits cut or eliminated. Tesla said on Wednesday the Model 3 rear-wheel drive credit will be reduced as a result of the guidance. The government will publish by April 18 a revised list of qualifying models and tax credit amounts.
The $430 billion Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) signed by Biden in August eliminated manufacturers’ EV sales caps but imposed new conditions on EV credits. They included a North American assembly requirement from August, price and buyer income eligibility caps from January 1, and now the battery and critical minerals sourcing rules, effective April 18.
Alliance for Automotive Innovation CEO John Bozzella said in a statement his best guess is “few” EVs on the market will qualify for the full $7,500 credit after April 17.
The IRA requires 50% of the value of battery components to be produced or assembled in North America to qualify for a $3,750 credit and 40% of the value of critical minerals sourced from the US or a free trade partner also for a $3,750 credit.
Treasury proposes a three-step process for determining the value percentage of critical minerals and a four-step process for determining battery component value.

3,India regulator probing Adani offshore deals,Investigation ongoing into possible violation of ‘related party’ transaction rules in the Adani Group’s dealings,"India’s market regulator is investigating possible violation of ‘related party’ transaction rules in the Adani Group’s dealings with at least three offshore entities that have links to the brother of the conglomerate’s founder, two people said.
The three entities allegedly entered into several investment transactions with unlisted units of the ports-to-power conglomerate founded by billionaire Gautam Adani over the last 13 years, said the sources with direct knowledge of the matter.
Vinod Adani, Gautam Adani’s brother, is either a beneficial owner, director or has links with those three offshore entities, said the two sources, adding the regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), is probing if lack of that disclosure violated ‘related party transaction’ rules.
Under Indian laws, direct relatives, promoter groups and subsidiaries of listed companies are considered related parties.
A promoter group is defined as an entity that has a large shareholding in a listed company and can influence company policy.
Transactions between such entities have to be disclosed in regulatory and public filings and require shareholder approval above a specified threshold. Violations typically attract monetary fines. An e-mail to SEBI requesting comment was not answered. SEBI chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch declined to comment on the Adani investigations at a news conference on Wednesday.
An Adani Group spokesperson said Vinod Adani is a member of the Adani family and is part of the promoter group, but he does not hold any managerial position in any of the listed Adani entities or their subsidiaries. “This fact, like all other material information required to be reported, has been disclosed to the regulatory authorities in the past and also as and when required,” the spokesperson added, without commenting on the regulatory probe into offshore entities.

4,AIIB says it won’t become ‘disoriented’ by geopolitics,Plans to stick to its mandate as an apolitical multilateral lender,"The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) will stick to its mandate as an apolitical multilateral lender and won’t get dragged into political disputes, even as multilateralism is severely tested, its President, Jin Liqun, said on Friday.
The lender is not going to become “disorientated” by geopolitical crises, he told Reuters on the sidelines of the Boao Forum in southern China’s Hainan province, whether that’s the war in Ukraine or disagreement between the US and China over debt restructuring in developing markets such as Sri Lanka.
“The more multilateralism comes under pressure, the more we need to work together to safeguard it,” Liqun said, adding the bank needed to “overcome all these headwinds to continue to support its clients in accordance with the basic mandate of this institution.”
Development financing has become the latest fault-line between Washington and Beijing.
Washington has accused the world’s largest bilateral lender of “dragging its feet” in debt relief talks for cash-strapped countries such as Sri Lanka and Zambia, while Beijing argues multilateral lenders like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) should also take losses.
The AIIB is “duty bound” to offer help to its members, such as Sri Lanka, which is seeking to secure loans from the IMF to rework its bilateral debts, Liqun said, “particularly when they are in distress.”
“But on the other hand, we need to protect the bank in terms of its credit-worthiness. We must protect our Triple A rating, so that our funding costs would not go up so much so that other borrowers would be suffering.”
As of November, the AIIB financed 194 projects totalling $37 billion, up from $29 billion in October 2021, according to S&P Global Ratings.
The banking sector was a hot topic at the forum following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and rescue of Credit Suisse.

5,OGRA starts developing loss recovery mechanism,Oil marketing firms claim losses of billions owing to rupee’s slump,"The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) has finally started developing a mechanism for the recovery of exchange rate losses, caused by Pakistani rupee’s free fall against the US dollar and borne by the oil marketing companies (OMCs).
Ogra, the oil and gas industry’s regulator, held a meeting with the representatives of OMCs on March 21, where it requested them to help establish a mechanism for the exchange rate adjustment.
During the huddle, the oil industry representatives complained that the regulator had been flouting the approved oil pricing mechanism and did not allow the OMCs to timely recover the exchange rate losses.
OMCs have already conveyed to the government that they had suffered losses of Rs32 billion in just one fortnight of February owing to the sudden depreciation of Pakistani rupee.
In the meeting, the OMCs argued that Ogra was bound to settle the exchange rate losses within a month’s time in line with the oil pricing formula.
In recent months, the regulator has been settling the exchange rate losses after 90 days instead of 30 days. This has pushed the OMCs to the verge of collapse.
Ogra insisted that the OMCs should retire Letters of Credit (LCs) for oil imports after selling petroleum products in the market without incorporating the exchange rate losses.
OMCs, other than Pakistan State Oil (PSO), had also requested for allowing them not to follow the date of LCs opened by PSO. At present, oil prices are linked with the cost of imports made by PSO.
Now, in a letter to the OMCs, Ogra has asked them to submit the exchange rate adjustment they had worked out for imports made over the past six months.
The regulator referred to a meeting held last month on the exchange rate loss adjustment, which was attended by the representatives of Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division), Oil Companies Advisory Council (OCAC), Oil Marketing Association of Pakistan (OMAP) and CEOs/ CFOs of OMCs.
In that connection, Ogra gave a brief presentation to the federal government/ Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet on developing a relevant policy.
According to the policy, exchange rate is to be used as provisionally available by PSO but to be converted to actual upon retirement of LC (not later than 60 days from the date of Bill of Lading). Any adjustment is to be made as prior period adjustment as per present practice, already approved by the ECC on April 9, 2020.
Other cost components (cost and freight (c&f) price of PSO, incidentals, and customs duty) may also be adjusted on an actual basis in the next fortnight.
Accordingly, in order to manage the foreign exchange impact on the import of petroleum products by the industry, it was advised by Ogra and the energy ministry that the exchange rate adjustment mechanism is linked with PSO’s payment cycle.
Therefore, in order to avoid any potential loss, the industry must align its procurement mechanism with the federal government’s prevailing policy.
Secondly, it was advised that the OMCs’ import price (c&f) should be competitive in relation with the benchmark Platts, since the federal government’s policy has benchmarked its price with the Arab Gulf Platts daily average for the number of days in the pricing period.
In order to critically review the matter, Ogra advised the OMCs to submit the working of their exchange rate adjustment for imports over the last six months within two weeks.
The working shall include the import cost recoverable under the exchange rate mechanism as per the federal government’s policy.
Secondly, the working will also include the unrecovered import cost due to being over and above the benchmarked parameters of the government’s policy.

6,Startup funding shows signs of revival in Q1-2023,"Raised $23.1m in 1Q23, marking a big 55% surge from the previous quarter","Pakistan’s startup funding has seen a slight increase after a downward trajectory for the last four quarters, with $23.1 million raised in Q1-2023, marking a 55% increase from the previous quarter, according to a report by ICT analyst at Alpha Beta Core, Sarwat Khan. The startup ecosystem is showing signs of revival, with six new deals in the following months after a slow start with only one deal in January.
Speaking to the Express Tribune, ICT analyst Waqas Ghani Kukaswadia said, “Although global economic activity has visibly stalled, investors remain cautiously optimistic in Pakistan. Businesses may see lower valuations, smaller round sizes, and fewer transactions. Entrepreneurs will now clearly have to demonstrate to investors that their company is worth investing in.”
Investor confidence on the rise
According to Sarwat Khan, despite the economic challenges, investors continue to show interest in the country’s startups, with all the deals in Seed and Pre-Seed levels. There has also been a surge in investor confidence, with 23 venture capitals (VCs) participating in the funding rounds, of which 74% are foreign VCs.
There was also an uptick in deal sizes as both the average and median levels posted some recovery and reached $3.85 million and $3.25 million, according to Data Darbar, respectively. This is one of the lowest gaps between average and median, which had widened significantly during the period of capital frenzy.
Early-stage startups flourish
During Q1-2022, Pakistan’s startup funding was skewed towards later-stage startups, with high-value deals in the business-to-business (B2B) segments such as Bazaar, Retailo and Jugnu. However, this year shows growing interest from investors in funding early-stage startups, indicating their willingness to take risks associated with investing in new startups.
Most of the money in 1Q23 went towards transport and logistics startups, which raised $10.1 million across 2 deals, according to Data Darba. The sector’s share in overall funding had declined from the highs of 2019, when it made up almost three-fourths of the total.
Top deals
Fintech remains the most favourite sector, sharing the stage with logistics, e-commerce, edtech, and hospitality following closely behind, according to the Alpha Beta Core report. The top two deals were AdalFi at $7.5 million and Trukkr at $6.4 million. Transport and logistics startups received the most funding, with $10.1 million across 2 deals.
According to Data Darbar, six of the eight deals in Q1-2023 were at seed stage and accounted for the entirety of disclosed funding, with the pre-seed and accelerator rounds never disclosed and thus not reflected in the amount.
“Despite the external challenges faced by the startup ecosystem in Pakistan, there remains a strong sense of perseverance and resilience,” said Khan, adding that, “Going forward, founders must adapt to the changing landscape, manage their cash burn carefully, and focus on profitability to attract investors.”
Looking ahead, experts expect the startup ecosystem in Pakistan to continue to progress and pick up pace as the global economy stabilises in the latter half of 2023 and begins to recover in 2024. According to Khan, Pakistan is considered a frontier market that is heading towards the emerging market, owing to its young population, growing middle class, and rate of urbanization and population growth.
However, as compared to global quantum, Pakistan’s quantum is always small funding size-wise, said ICT analyst at Topline Securities, Nasheed Malik Textile. Pakistani companies have witnessed downsized valuations, even listed companies. Investors have given them investment on cheap valuations, which is a good thing in the long run, he added.
Pakistan’s emerging market status presents a long-term opportunity for investors in the startup and venture capital sector. According to experts, this sector regards long-term opportunities more than any other sector.

7,Stocks end flat in roller-coaster week,"KSE-100 index inches up by 58 points, or 0.15%, and settles at 40,001","Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) endured a roller-coaster ride with several ups and downs in the outgoing week as trading remained volatile due to the prevailing economic and political tensions, which kept the benchmark KSE-100 index on a leash. The index closed flat at 40,001 points at the end of the week.
The week started on a positive note when the index managed to recover slightly following Finance Minister Ishaq Dar’s announcement that matters with the IMF would be settled soon.
Another flat session was witnessed on Tuesday during which investors remained cautious due to delay in revival of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme and political chaos, which impacted the buying momentum.
Bears took complete control of the market on Wednesday owing to the rising political temperature after a local court in Islamabad issued non-bailable arrest warrants against Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief Imran Khan in the case of threatening a female judge.
Negative momentum prevailed on Thursday as well when the index inched down in the absence of positive triggers coupled with uncertainty on the political front with calls of early elections and delay in resumption of the IMF programme.
The market staged a rebound in the final session of the week and the index crept up after finance minister’s revelation that “all technical discussions have been completed and an agreement is nearing with the IMF.” The index closed above the 40,000 mark on the back of buying in selective stocks ahead of the quarter’s end.
At close of the week, the KSE-100 index recorded gains of 58 points, or 0.15% week-on-week, and settled at 40,001.
JS Global analyst Muhammad Waqas Ghani, in his report, noted that the KSE-100 index ended the week flat as the IMF’s ninth review remained on hold due to the pending assurances from friendly countries. Political noise rose during the week in the backdrop of a Supreme Court hearing on the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) decision to postpone the provincial assembly elections, he said.
The index closed at 40,000 points, up 0.1% week-on-week, where cement and fertiliser sectors were the prominent performers. On the economic front, the IMF programme remained stalled as the lender awaited guarantees of $3 billion assistance from the UAE and Saudi Arabia.
As per the latest State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) numbers, the foreign currency reserves held by the central bank decreased by $354 million to $4.2 billion owing to the external debt repayment.
“The decline came after six consecutive weeks of increases, which were mainly on the back of commercial loans given by China,” the JS analyst said.
Pakistan again requested China to roll over a $2 billion loan to help prop up the dwindling reserves and according to the finance ministry, documentation process for the loan had been completed, he added.
Arif Habib Limited, in its report, said that the market witnessed a lacklustre activity during the week, mainly because of uncertainty about the resumption of IMF programme.
In order to unlock the next loan tranche, the IMF sought confirmation of financing from friendly countries including Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
As a result, it said, Pakistani rupee depreciated against the US dollar by Rs0.59, or 0.21% week-on-week, closing at 283.79/$. Moreover, the SBP’s reserves shrank $345 million week-on-week and reached $4.2 billion. In terms of sectors, positive contribution to the market came from automobile assemblers (61 points), fertiliser (34 points), cement (10 points), insurance (4 points), and glass and ceramics (3 points).
Negative contribution came from miscellaneous (112 points), commercial banks (20 points), and power generation and distribution (17 points). Foreigners’ buying continued during the week as they bought stocks worth $0.3 million as compared to net buying of $0.5 million last week, the AHL report added.

8,Banks battle rising non-performing loans,"NPLs have increased by almost 3% to Rs938.67 billion in the quarter ended December 31, 2022","The cost of living and cost of doing business in Pakistan have risen significantly in recent times, leading to a surge in non-performing loans (NPLs) and causing banks to suffer losses.
According to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), all banks and development finance institutions’ (DFIs) NPLs have increased by almost 3%, or Rs25.53 billion, to Rs938.67 billion in the quarter ended December 31, 2022, compared to Rs913.14 billion in the previous quarter ended September 30, 2022.
More importantly, the net NPLs have also recorded a significant rise of 32%, or Rs23.90 billion, to Rs98.69 billion in the December quarter, compared to Rs74.79 billion in the previous quarter. Banks begin recording NPLs after borrowers fail to repay loans for at least three consecutive months.
Another set of data suggests that banks have lent Rs12.65 trillion to the corporate and households in the quarter ended December 2022, while NPLs rose to Rs924 billion, showing the infection ratio stood at 7.3 in the quarter.

The corporate sector is reported to be the single largest defaulter of loans at Rs717.29 billion in the quarter, followed by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) at Rs74.85 billion. The agriculture sector’s NPLs stood at Rs55.80 billion, while the consumer sector’s (credit cards, auto loans, consumer durable, mortgage loans and others) NPLs stood at Rs32.16 billion. Commodity financing (for cotton, rice, surge, wheat and others) NPLs stood at Rs7.25 billion, while NPLs coming from banks and DFIs’ own staff were recorded at Rs2.65 billion in the quarter ended December 31, 2022.
Speaking to the Express Tribune, Arif Habib Limited Economist Sana Tawfik highlighted the textile sector as one of the largest banks’ defaulters in recent times. The textile sector alone attracts around 60% of the total export proceeds and remains the single largest export earning sector of Pakistan. “NPLs have become a significant concern for banks in the current fiscal year amid the high economic crisis in the country,” she said, adding that, the capacity of households and corporates to repay loans has been badly weakened due to inflation being recorded at historical highs of 35.4% in March, coupled with an all-time high markup rate (the benchmark six-month Karachi inter-bank offered rate/Kibor) at 22%. Such numbers were also alarming in the quarters under review.
The size of interest money on the borrowed money has increased significantly with Kibor hovering at 22% compared to almost half of it about a couple of years ago during Covid-19 times.
She said the high inflation reading and high interest rate have multiplied the cost of living and the cost of doing business. Accordingly, millions of people have lost jobs, while a large number of factories are lying partially or completely closed. Tawfik said that many households and businesses are failing to repay their loans to banks. Quoting a leading bank, she said, it was almost impossible for a large number of clients to return personal loans like car financing at this time when the Kibor has shot to a record high of 22%.
Some banks have offered their clients the option to defer payment of the principal amount of the loan for a couple of months but continue to pay interest money to survive in the crisis. They are also offering clients the option to restructure the debt, meaning setting a new schedule for the repayment of the loan and the interest money.
This way, the banks are not only saving themselves from heavy losses and a likely collapse of weaker financial institutions, but they are also saving their clients who remain a source of income in the long run. The SBP data suggests that all banks and DFIs have recovered Rs33.39 billion in the December-end quarter compared to Rs18.23 billion recovered in the previous September-end quarter.
She said, the banks had estimated non-performing loans worth billions of rupees on their balance-sheet during the testing times of Covid-19 to efficiently manage the NPLs crisis. They are now reversing the NPLs on the balance-sheet after the NPSs were recorded less in actual than their estimates. Sometimes, some of the borrowers manage to repay the loans through negotiated deals later on. This also help banks recover some of the NPLs.
