0,FO flatly denies ‘Israel trade rumours’,Says there is no change in country's policy towards Jewish state,"Pakistan has denied it permitted any trade with Israel, saying there is no change in the country's policy towards the Jewish state.
The denial was issued after a recent statement by the American Jewish Congress (AJC) was shared on social media on the purported offloading of a shipment carrying Pakistani-originated food products in Israel.
""Pakistan does not have diplomatic or trade relations with Israel. There is no change in the policy,"" foreign office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said in a brief statement.
In a separate statement, the Ministry of Commerce said the rumours about the commencement of Pakistan-Israel trade are sheer propaganda and the press release of American Jewish Congress was misrepresented.
 “Even in their press release, they nowhere mentioned official trade between Pakistan and Israel,” read the statement. Pakistan has neither any trade relations with Israel nor it intends to develop any, it added.
A Jewish Pakistani, Fishel Benkhald, sent food samples to three businessmen in Jerusalem and Haifa through the UAE in personal capacity. Benkhald had met these businessmen in foreign countries during food exhibitions.
Nevertheless, it was not supported by the Government of Pakistan and no banking or official channel was involved either in such activity.
“Moreover, in our talks with the UAE, the issue of origin will be strictly implemented. The UAE has curtailed tariffs on 96 per cent goods traded with Israel which has benefited traders from the UAE to Israel,” it said.
The story first surfaced when Benkhald claimed on Twitter that he had become the first exporter of Pakistani food edible products to Israel. The post had triggered a strong reaction online from certain quarters, under the presumption that the trade was connected to a shift in relations with Israel.
A controversy over Pakistan's ties with Israel was also stirred up last year over a reported visit of a ""Pakistani delegation"" to Israel.
The FO spokesperson in a statement had clarified that the “reported visit in question was organised by a foreign NGO which is not based in Pakistan"" and that Pakistan’s position on the Palestinian issue was clear and unambiguous.
“There is no change whatsoever in our policy on which there is a complete national consensus. Pakistan steadfastly supports the Palestinian people’s inalienable right to self-determination,” the spokesperson had remarked.
The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and critics of the current government cashed in on the controversy and accused the PDM of implementing the ""regime change"" promises.
The government supporters hit back at the PTI by reminding it that the Pakistani Jewish national was first granted permission to travel to Israel by the Imran Khan government.
