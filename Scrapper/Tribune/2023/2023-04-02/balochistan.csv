As part of the crackdown on defaulters, the excise department has arrested 13 major defaulters and has successfully recovered a sum of Rs30.07 million from them.
Building upon this momentum, the department has made it mandatory for all major VVIP housing societies within the city to obtain a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the department for the sale and transfer of property titles.
Any properties that are transferred without this NOC will be considered a bookable offence, and violators will be subjected to heavy fines.
On contact, sources in the department confirmed that the rule of NOC will provide the department with additional revenue of millions of rupees annually.
They said that the property registrar has already been informed about this through a notice.
According to the notice, houses and plots in big housing societies can no longer be transferred without NOC from the department.

1,230 Adiala inmates test positive for hepatitis,Blood screening raises alarm over inmates' health,"Blood screening of prisoners in the Adiala Central Prison has revealed that at least 230 inmates are suffering from Hepatitis C and a single prisoner is living with Hepatitis B.
The results have raised serious questions about the quality of food and drinking water being provided to the prisoners.
According to official sources, the screening was conducted by the Rawalpindi District Health Authority (DHA).
They said no inmate tested positive for HIV AIDS, against the expectations of many.
As per the jail manual, it is necessary to provide food to prisoners per the hygiene rules.
The health authority conducted the screening from March 13 to March 27 during which, a blood screening of 5,830 prisoners was conducted.
Of these, 5,660 were male prisoners and 170 were female, the sources said.
A special team of the DHA carried out the sampling process for Hepatitis B, C, HIV AIDS along with other diseases.
As per the results of the tests, several inmates were also living with anaemia.
Sources also said a huge number of cases have shed light on the negligence and carelessness of the jail administration in ensuring the supply of quality food to the inmates as per hygiene rules.
Meanwhile, the DHA has taken responsibility for the treatment of the 230 prisoners who have been confirmed to have Hepatitis C.
Prisoners with these diseases will be given a course of medicine for four months.

2,Fruit sales plunge as boycott campaign digs in,Social media played key role in making the boycott a success,"With a successful boycott campaign against ‘ridiculously inflated’ fruit prices, the residents of the twin cities have managed to bring profiteers and hoarders to their knees and reduce the prices of various fruits by 100 per cent.
Hit hard by the skyrocketing inflation, the public extended support to the ‘Fruit Boycott’ call that first appeared on social media and urged people not to purchase fruits as a protest against the exorbitant prices of the commodities during the holy month of Ramazan.
On Friday, the prices of bananas, watermelons, strawberries, apples, guavas, and oranges recorded a sharp downward trend.
The citizens breathed a sigh of relief and urged others to follow their lead and continue the boycott.
At the beginning of the fasting month, melons were being sold at Rs250 per kg in the twin cities, while following the boycott drive, their prices tumbled to Rs120 and Rs150 per kg.
Earlier, the Sindhi watermelon was being sold at Rs150 per kg, however, after the boycott, the price of watermelon has reduced to Rs50 per kg.
According to sources privy to the development, these prices are likely to decline further.
At the onset of the holy month, the best quality bananas were being sold at Rs500 per dozen.
After the boycott, they are being sold at Rs250 to Rs200 per dozen.
Similarly, the price of watermelon has been brought from Rs200 to Rs80 per kg.
The prices of various types of apples have fallen from Rs450 to Rs200.
Meanwhile, strawberries were being sold at Rs350 per kg before the campaign.
Now they are being sold at Rs150 per kg.
The price of guava has also been brought down to Rs250 from Rs350 per kg.
In the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad, the price of a kg of oranges was jacked up to Rs450 per kg with the onset of the spring.
Now, fruit sellers have been compelled to fix the new price of oranges at Rs300 per dozen.
Commenting on the significant reduction in the prices of fruits due to the boycott, a customer named Tabsum Bibi said that she lives near Stadium Road and buys fruits from a relatively cheap makeshift bazaar near the Allama Iqbal Park.
According to the Price Control Committee officials, the most positive impact of the citizens' boycott has been on fruit prices.
He said that the prices are still higher than the purchasing power of the citizens, but if the citizens of the twin cities continue such a boycott, the prices may decrease further, which will benefit the trader less and the buyer more.
