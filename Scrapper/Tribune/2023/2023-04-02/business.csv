0,"Varsity imposes ban on wearing jeans, tights","Girls directed to wear knee-length kurtas, shalwars as well as white dupattas","The Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Women University (SBBWU), Peshawar has introduced a new “modest” dress code for its students by banning the use of jeans and tights on the campus.
The university’s registrar office issued a formal notification in this regard in which students have been asked to strictly adhere to the new dress code.
“Students have to wear knee-length kurtas, shalwars, and white dupattas, which has been made compulsory for them as per the new dress code,” the notification read.
The university directed the students to wear their student cards on the university premises, warning them that the new code had been introduced after approval from the registrar office and violators would be imposed a fine of Rs1,000.
The issue of introducing a new dress code was not new as the former governor Shah Farman directed all the public universities to change its open dress code policy after he received complaints that the incidents of sexual harassment were on the rise in the varsities across K-P.
It seemed that K-P Governor Haji Ghulam Ali had been following in the footsteps of his predecessor as he himself hailed from the highly conservative JUI-F.
Earlier, the Hazara University Abbotabad, the Bacha Khan University Charsadda, and the University of Peshawar introduced these dress codes which invited widespread criticism.
In March 2021, the Kohat University of Science and Technology (KUST) also introduced a dress code, asking girl students to wear abaya.
In a notification issued on March 9, the KUST administration directed its boy students to either wear white shalwar kameez or grey dress pants with black shoes.
The girl students had been asked to wear white shalwar with any kameez of full sleeves, scarf, dupata, chaddar, black abaya and black shoes. In the winters, they had to wear black sweaters, coats or plain jackets with black abayas.
Furthermore, the faculty members were also directed to wear a formal dress with black gown in the classes.
This policy was implemented from the spring semester (March 15, 2021).
Earlier, the University of Hazara banned skin tight jeans, shorts, earrings and make-up which invited widespread criticism on social media. Similarly, the BKU Charsadda even asked its staffers not to wear jeans. After the criticism, the UoP issued a clever notification regarding the dress code. It simply asked the girl students to wear shalwar kameez instead of mentioning jeans, tights or shorts. This pattern was also followed by KUST in order to avoid criticism.
The KUST official said that the governor wanted a conservative dress code for the university students and universities were just obeying the instruction.

2,Enraged mob clashes with police over distribution of free wheat flour,Protesters complain of waiting in long queues all day only to return home empty-handed and demand fair distribution,"Saturday was yet another day of protests and brawls between police and general public as mismanagement and stampedes once again marked the day during the distribution of free wheat flour in Peshawar.
Protests broke out in Hayatabad area of the city during the distribution of free wheat flour after a mob tried to forcefully enter the Hayatabad Sports Complex and the police tried to stop them. The police used tear-gas shelling to disperse the violent mob which in return pelted stones at the police vehicles and personnel. They blocked the road in protest, demanding fair distribution.
The protesters complained that they had to wait in long queues for the entire day and still returned home empty-handed.
They claimed that wheat flour was being distributed on the basis of nepotism, with political affiliation taken into account.
Complaints of not receiving the free government wheat flour were increasing with each passing day.
The police had advised the provincial government to use the Frontier Constabulary (FC) to keep the law and order situation under control during the process of free wheat flour distribution. 
The district administration told The Express Tribune that they had to stop the process of wheat flour distribution after stone-pelting and stampedes damaged the vehicles at the sports complex.
The police officials said they had hardly come up with the manpower for the ongoing census in the city.
Apart from that, they also had to deploy police personnel for the security of bazaars and mosques during the holy month of Ramazan.
They said across the province, its southern districts in particular, a large number of women gathered at the distribution points to collect free wheat flour, making it difficult for the police to manage the situation.
