0,‘Only male members of Mohajir population are counted in census’,Sattar emphasises that MQM is united and organised among its people in this difficult time,"The Muttahida Qaumi Movement Pakistan (MQM-P) leader Dr Farooq Sattar expressed his concerns on undercounting of the Mohajir population in the census. Speaking at the Iftar dinner, Sattar warned that the people of Karachi are being counted less in the census, and that it feels like only men are being counted, while women are not.
He emphasised that MQM is united and organised among its people in this difficult time, and that the party will not tolerate any attempts to capture Karachi by underestimating the Mohajir population. “We have been halved every time and this time too there is a conspiracy to count us less. The feudal lords are trying to make their constituencies at 15,000 and Muhajir constituencies at 90,000. We are warning that if anyone is thinking that they will capture Karachi by undercounting the Muhajir population, then they are all mistaken”, said Sattar.
Meahwhile, MQM leader and Member of the National Assembly, Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, speaking at an Iftar party, said that MQM has begun its journey afresh. Mustafa Kamal has been given huge responsibilities of party and so he cannot be nominated for governorship. He said, Kamran Tessori is party’s nominated governor and no one can replace him.

2,"JI wants SC full court to decide Punjab, K-P poll delay case","Baloch notes political tensions and economic crisis are exacerbating tendency towards vengeance, extremism in society","The Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) has called for a full court bench to hear the case on holding elections for the provincial assemblies of K-P and Punjab. Speaking to the media in Hyderabad during a ration distribution event on Saturday, JI Ameer Liaquat Baloch said, ""The chief justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial should not act with willfulness like the politicians do. Rather, he [CJP] should give decisions on the controversial political and constitutional matters so that the country can be pulled out of crises.""
Baloch noted that political tensions and the economic crisis are exacerbating the tendency towards vengeance and extremism in society. Commenting on the recusal of two judges from the bench hearing Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's (PTI) petition for holding elections in Punjab, Baloch expressed concern over the apparent rifts among the superior judiciary, stating that the country could be plunged into further chaos if burning political matters are handled with ego and stubbornness. Baloch went on to criticise the coalition government in the centre, accusing them of being incapable and indifferent to the plight of the people affected by unprecedented inflation.
He considered all the relief measures of the government as cosmetic and argued that a government that cannot even properly distribute subsidised flour can never efficiently run the country. The JI leader called on the leaders of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) to acknowledge their failure in the centre, Sindh, and Balochistan. On the occasion, he reiterated his party's demand that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) should be made a completely autonomous and financially independent entity.
He said that only free, fair, and transparent general elections can offer a solution to the crisis the country is facing. He warned that any controversial decision by the apex court could push the country into further trouble.

4,DHA prepares for future monsoon rains,Advance drainage system is designed for the next 100 years,"The Defence Housing Authority (DHA) is set to complete the first phase of its monsoon rain drainage project, the 49km-long storm water drainage system, by June 2023.
The drainage system is designed with forecasted rainfall data for the next 100 years in view, and six additional outfalls equipped with power pumps are being constructed to channel rainwater into the Mahmoodabad drain and the sea. The decision to construct a storm water drainage system was made in response to the emergency situation arising from the abnormal rains of the monsoon seasons in 2020 and 2022.
According to the DHA administration reports that the project is fast to approach its completion and was launched in September 2022. A 1.5-meter-deep and 2.5-meter-wide storm drain in the 74-km-long project will pass under the paved road of Tar Coal, and the project is expected to take a year and a half to complete.
The project is four times larger than the previous drainage system, which considered the 100 years of rainfall data in their design. The completion of the project is expected to bring relief from previous experiences for the residents who have suffered from flooding during monsoon season.
The project is divided into two phases and the areas that were heavily affected during the monsoon rains of 2020 and 2022 were given priority in the first phase. Shattering of the main drain is still ongoing at the drainage project while roofs of link and interceptors are being prepared at the batching plant.
A laboratory has also been set up by the consultant to check the raw material and its quality. DHA reports that there have been many challenges faced during the completion of this project, including landslides during excavation, relocation of clean drinking water lines, and transfer of underground services lines to another place by K-Electric and Sui Southern Company.
The process of replacing old sewage lines and clean drinking water lines with new ones is also ongoing. Meanwhile, there was a negative impact on the ongoing works due to the recent increase in the prices of iron and cement, the issue was largely overcome.

7,"PPP will sweep UC by-polls in Karachi, claims Ghani",Says labour leader Liaquat Shahi and others would strengthen PPP,"Sindh Minister for labour and manpower Saeed Ghani on Saturday said that the previous chief justices of Pakistan were doing everything to weaken the national institutions. Speaking at a press conference at his Camp Office he said that labour leader Liaquat Shahi and others would strengthen the PPP.
""We will win the by-elections in 11 union councils with a big margin,"" he claimed. The PPP has allotted ticket to Liaquat Shahi for UC 3 Shah Faisal Colony by-polls where the PPP and PML-N are contesting the elections jointly. Speaking on the occasion, Liaquat Shahi thanked the PPP chairman for reposing trust in him.
""It is high time all progressive forces came out in support of the PPP and vote for it in the by-election."" Responding questions from reporters, Ghani said that unfortunately the previous chief justices of the Supreme Court, especially Iftikhar Chaudhry and Saqib Nisar had undermined the respect for the judiciary by indulging in unnecessary judicial activism.
""The (current) chief justice should give up his ego. A disputed bench should not rule on issues of national politics,"" he said while referring to the ongoing election delay case in the Supreme Court.

9,"‘Mom, we don’t want new dresses, please get up’",12 people were killed in a stampede during the distribution of Zakat in Karachi's SITE area,"The tragedy of Friday's deadly stampede for Zakat handouts at a factory continues to unfold as heart-rending stories of victims come to light. Naseem Begum had gone to the factory to receive a cash handout in Zakat, so that she could buy new dresses for her children on Eid. Little did she know that she would not be with her family on Eid.
Naseem's body was shifted to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, where her husband, Shahid Ali, and 10-year-old son came to collect it. Nobody could hold back tears when the 10-year-old begged his mom's body to get up. ""Mom! Get up, let's go home. Why are you not getting up? Mom, we don't want new dresses. Get up and we go home."" Shahid Ali, who is an auto-rickshaw driver, recalled his last conversation with his wife.
""She said that the factory is distributing charity money. With this money, we can buy new Eid dresses for our children,"" Shahid said while quoting his wife. He said that he had asked his wife to stay home and stop worrying about new Eid dresses. Allah will make arrangements, but she would not listen. ""She asked me for Rs100 for fare and said that other women from the neighbourhood are also going there. I will be back with them soon,"" Shahid recalled his wife telling him.
Shahid said that he gave in when his wife insisted. ""She took along our son and daughter to collect a Zakat cash handout,"" he said, adding that his wife got electrocuted during the stampede. ""My daughter sustained minor injuries, while my son remained unharmed,"" he said. Wailing, crying, sobbing and mourning made the hospital environment somber.
A man collapsed after seeing the body of his 10-yearold daughter. Survivors of the tragedy, who were taken to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, alleged that the factory management beat the handoutseekers with iron rods and sticks which triggered the deadly stampede.
