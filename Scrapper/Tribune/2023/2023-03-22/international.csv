0,"Free, quality healthcare cornerstone of PPP manifesto: Aseefa","Advancements in healthcare in Sindh, where PPP is in government, bear testament to this commitment, she said","Providing free and quality public healthcare has been a cornerstone of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) manifesto, said Aseefa Bhutto Zardari in a statement issued on Tuesday.
She pointed out that under the PPP-led Sindh government, the National Institute of Cardiovascular Disease (NICVD) has been strengthened into one of the strongest cardiac networks spread across 22 districts of Sindh with 10 hospitals and 24 chest pain units.
The advancements in healthcare in Sindh, where PPP is in government, bear testament to this commitment and its success has been unparalleled, she said.
Be it cardiac care, liver and kidney transplants, or bringing down infant mortality through pre and neo natal care, PPP remains at the forefront of providing free quality healthcare for all, Assefa said.
The statement added that along with the 10 hospitals across Sindh in Karachi, Tando Muhammad Khan, Hyderabad, Sehwan, Larkana, Sukkur, Nawabshah, Mithi, and Khairpur, the Pakistan Peoples Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari laid the foundation stone of another hospital in Landhi, Karachi. The Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Institute of Cardiovascular Disease is set to be the world’s largest cardiac hospital with a 1,200-bed facility.
Aseefa said that treatments that cost thousands of dollars abroad have been made free and accessible due to the hard work of PPP and under the leadership of Bilawal Bhutto.
She reminded that in the past five years, approximately over 100,000 primary angioplasties and over 25,000 cardiac surgeries have been conducted in NICVDs across Sindh. Taking exception to the criticism of distractors, Aseefa said, despite the malicious allegations being circulated against the PPP and its leadership, the reality of the situation is that the PPP is the only party to have established such revolutionary treatment centers in Pakistan. 
Whether it is Gambat Institute of Medical Science in Khairpur, providing free liver, kidney, bone marrow and cancer treatment, or the Child Life Hospitals across Sindh, or JPMC CyberKnife robotic radio-surgery targeting cancer ranging from; brain, head, neck and spine, that could cost $60,000-$90,000 abroad is available for free in Karachi.

1,Stalemate persists in postal officers housing society land dispute,"Notice to NADRA, home secretary over Afghan woman's citizenship plea","The status of the houses of the Pakistan Post officials is in limbo as the housing society where it is located remains locked in a dispute over ownership, with the Sindh Board of Revenue (SBR) department contending that the area is protected under the Sindh Goth-Abad (Housing Scheme) Act 1987. 
Officers of the postal department have plots in the Pakistan Post Office Employees Cooperative Housing Society, which the revenue department says is rural village land of Abdullah Shah Ghazi Goth and protected under the village development scheme.
The housing society counsel argued before the Sindh High Court that the scheme designed to protect ancient villages within the Karachi division from builder mafia was being misused by unscrupulous elements for land grabbing. 
The SBR counsel submitted a report stating that 1000-yard bungalows have been built on the land belonging to the goth. The counsel contended that housing society members have neither the ownership rights nor any legal documents, hence their title is questionable.
The housing society's lawyer said that the Supreme Court had ordered that no village could be established in urban areas, but 65 acres of land belonging to the Post Office Society had been encroached upon on pretext of Goth Abad scheme.
The lawyer for the East district assistant commissioner said the society had purchased land which was adjacent to the rural area.
The court adjourned the case till April 18 due to lack of time.
Afghan woman's citizenship plea 
The SHC issued notices to the Home secretary and National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) officials regarding the petition of an Afghan woman seeking Pakistani citizenship. 
The counsel stated Zainab Bibi married a Pakistani citizen in 2008. She and her spouse have been residing in the Defence Housing Authority area of Karachi since 2008. 
The authorities concerned are not processing Zainab's application for domicile although she has been living at her current address for the several years, the counsel said.
The Sindh chief justice remarked whether all immigrants living in Pakistan for a long time were liable to get citizenship.

2,217 killed ‘in the name of honour’ in 2022: report,"Says 36 killings took place in Jacobabad alone, followed by 27 in Kashmore and 23 in Ghotki","At least 217 people, including 152 women, have been killed in the so called honour-related crimes across Sindh in 2022, as per the data compiled by Sindh Suhai Organisation (SSO), a nongovernmental organisation (NGO).
""As many as 36 people were targeted in Jacobabad district alone, while 27 people were killed in Kashmore district,"" disclosed SOS Chairperson Dr Aisha Hassan Dharejo on Tuesday.
According to the breakdown, 23 people were killed in Ghotki, 16 in Shikarpur, 14 in Larkana, 10 in Khairpur, five in Sukkur, and 86 in other districts during the period between January and December 2022.
""Landlords have their own laws in the rural areas,"" Dr Dharejo said. ""They are so powerful that even police avoid registering FIRs against killers [in honur-related crimes],"" she added.
Women's rights activist Anees Haroon urged the government to register murder cases since the bereaved families in most cases submit to jirgas and do not pursue court cases.
Justice (retd) Majida Rizvi also questioned the state for not becoming party in such murder cases. ""There should not be any compromise in such killings,"" she added.
Dr Badar, a senior member of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, said that cases of honour killing go up during the harvesting season. ""It is like a 'business' in the rural areas,"" he said.

4,Industrialist gets bail in Rs2b coal scam,"In November 2022, a NAB court sentenced Gohar to seven years imprisonment and a fine of Rs50m for illegal sale of coal","The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Tuesday suspended the sentence of a business tycoon of Hyderabad, Gohar Ullah, in a coal corruption reference of over Rs2 billion and granted him bail.
An SHC bench heard the bail petition of Gohar Ullah, the former president of Hyderabad Chamber of Commerce (HCCI). The court granted Gohar bail against surety of Rs1 million.
In November 2022, a National Accountability Bureau (NAB) court had sentenced Gohar to seven years imprisonment and a fine of Rs50 million for illegal sale of coal.
The Fateh Group was awarded a contract to build a 200 megawatt power plant powered by coal.
Although the plant was never established, the company allegedly began to mine between 800 and 1,000 tons of coal every day and sold it in the market. The mines and minerals department efforts to rectify the situation were stalled by Gohar, allegedly through political influence.
Subsequently last November, Gohar and five others were convicted for selling coal meant for use as fuel for the power generation in the open market for more than a decade. However, the SHC bench accepting Gohar's plea suspended the sentence and granted him bail.

5,"Gas woes a spanner in sehri, iftar prep","As Ramazan approaches, many consider alternative fuel options","With the arrival of the holy month of Ramazan, the inflation-battered people of Karachi are now anticipating a cooking crisis with gas shortage expected to continue.
Where most would expect the arrival of Ramazan to be a source of peace for the practising majority, the concurrent shortage of gas has triggered immense worry among the people, who are now frantically searching for alternative options.
“Ramazan holds great significance for us Muslims. How can we observe the holy month when we cannot cook food to keep our fasts and break them,” complained Nishat Farooqui, a family head. Farooqui said that she had instructed her sons to look for alternative cooking fuel options to prevent a possible crisis at the times of sunrise and sunset meals of suhoor and iftar.
Agreeing with Farooqui, a local, Faisal Ali revealed that he had already purchased a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinder to mitigate gas shortage and to have a peaceful Ramazan.
It seems that Ali might not be the only one as, according to Athar, a shopkeeper selling LPG cylinders and stoves. The demand for cylinders has increased manifold in the past couple of weeks since families prefer stocking up on the paraphernalia, in case shops run out by the time Ramazan begins, he said. “Our cylinders are selling fast nowadays,” said Athar, with cylinder cost ranging from Rs2000 to Rs3000.
While some like Farooqui and Ali can afford to invest in expensive cooking gas alternatives, others like Razia Bano, a homemaker, shudder at the possibility of an added expenditure.
“Inflation has already left many of us broke,” said Bano. “With food in itself becoming increasingly unaffordable, we cannot even imagine spending extra money on cooking fuel,” she retorted.
Many shared strategic cooking tips and dining plans to avoid a food crisis due to shortage of gas during the holy month.nts 
Homemaker Mehak Tariq advised those involved in meal preparation to work in the kitchen during the earlier hours of the day so that cooked food is available for iftar and sehri. “In case this is not possible, people could try eating out,” she suggested.
While the prospect of dining might seem appealing to affluent families, the reality on-ground is that it is elusive, to say the least, for the average salaried citizen.
“Many people turn to tea stalls after Iftar, when gas is not available. But in the past one year, inflation has caused a cup of tea to cost twice as much,” said Sufyan, another local. “If the gas crisis continues, it is highly unlikely that we would be able to rejuvenate ourselves by consuming tea after breaking our fast,” he said.
While citizens resent the need to turn to costly restaurants for basic beverages, the owners of such establishments see this as an opportunity to capitalise on the inability of people to prepare these items in their own homes. Many hotels have already started investing heavily in LPG cylinders. 
“Despite LPG raising our total costs drastically, we have made the compromise since demand for our items would increase in case a gas shortage happens,” said Khalid, a shopkeeper.
According to sources privy to information, gas load-shedding has been taking place since the preceding winter months from 10 PM to 6 PM in Karachi, despite the arrival of the summer season.
“Since summer is here and the demand for gas has gone down, why do we still have a gas shortage is hard for me to fathom,” protested Farzana Bibi.
As the outcry of the citizens continues, officials from the Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) however, report that no updates about the availability of gas during Ramazan have been conveyed to them from the higher authorities.

6,Naeem urges ECP to decide pending results,JI leader accuses PPP of ‘buying votes’ for mayor slot,"Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) Karachi head Hafiz Naeemur Rehman urged the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to decide the cases, “particularly the open and shut case of six union councils”, pending before it for over two months. 
He also criticised Pakistan People Party (PPP) chief Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari over his recent statement that the party should challenge the local body election schedule issued by the ECP.
The ECP recently announced the schedule for polls on 93 seats across Sindh. It includes 11 seats in Karachi. The PPP and JI are locked in battle over the seat of Karachi’s mayor. 
Naeem urged the ECP to complete the electoral process within the month of April “so Karachiites could exercise their right to have an elected local government”. He also accused the PPP of trying to ‘buy the votes’ of PTI councilors in order to get the mayor’s seat.

9,Rs15b Ramazan package approved,"Cabinet okays Rs2,000 each for 7.8m families for subsidised atta","The Sindh cabinet on Tuesday approved a multibillion-rupee Ramazan package for the low-income families for the purchase of subsidised wheat flour. 
Under the whopping Rs15.6 billion package, Rs2,000 each will be transferred to more than 7.8 million families for the purchase of 30kg wheat flour at the rate of Rs65 per kg. 
The provincial cabinet, which met with Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah in the chair, also amended a law to increase the penalty on retailers who fail to display the official rate list of commodities and charge exorbitant prices. 
“The cash transfer to the targeted low-income families would be made through Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) for which eligible families would receive a message on their cell phones and those who do not receive such a message and their average income is less than Rs50,000 per month can send a message/CNIC number on Toll-Free 8171 Facility for inquiring about eligibility for the subsidy,” CM Shah said and added that approximately 7,810,482 families with BISP’s Proxy Means Test (PMT) score in the range of 1 to 60, for cash transfer of Rs2,000/family under the relief scheme.
According to Shah, the total outlay of subsidy, taking 30kg wheat flour per family at Rs130/kg as a base, would translate to Rs15.62 billion.

The fine for failure to display price list has been increased from Rs50,000 to Rs100,000 for producers or dealers, Rs20,000 for retailers other than pushcart vendors, and Rs10,000 to Rs20,000 for pushcart vendors. 
Similarly, the fine for retailers’ failure to declare stocks of essential commodities has been increased from Rs50,000 to Rs100,000 and the fine for sale of commodities at a higher than officially notified price has been increased from 50,000 to Rs100,000.
Bachat Bazaars
The chief minister directed the chief secretary to ensure the establishment of Bachat Bazaars, one in each taluka, where provision of wheat flour, sugar, ghee, and other essential edible items at subsidised rates would be ensured. The cabinet decided to launch a drive against profiteering and hoarding. 
The Industries Department was directed to ensure availability of stocks of sugar, vegetable oil, and other items, and the district administration, Bureau of Supply and Prices to ensure availability at the notified rates. The Utility Stores Corporation (USC) has 113 outlets in the division, and they will provide 19 items at subsidised rates.
Rescue 1122
The Sindh cabinet decided to establish Sindh Emergency Service Rescue 1122 for which a draft bill was presented.
