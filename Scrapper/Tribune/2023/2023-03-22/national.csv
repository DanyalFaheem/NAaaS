0,HBFC barred from risky borrowing,PC picks two investors for privatisation of housing finance company,"The Privatisation Commission (PC) board on Tuesday barred the management of House Building Finance Company (HBFC) from taking expensive but risky commercial loans for their re-lending and investment in government debt, and picked two parties for privatisation of the entity.
The PC board met under the chairmanship of Abid Hussain Bhayo, PC Chairman, and considered the privatisation of HBFC, an entity that had been on the active privatisation list for the past five years with little progress.
At a time when the PC was putting in all its energies to sell the company, the HBFC management tried to borrow more to finance new mortgage loans, finance investment in government securities and finance the development of land blocks on its balance sheet.
The expensive loans at around 23% interest rate would have eroded the chances of privatising the entity.
“The board, while appreciating the proposal, suggested that the HBFC privatisation transaction was at an advanced stage and that any initiative having financial implications may be avoided at this stage,” said a statement issued by the privatisation ministry after the board meeting.
HBFC CEO apprised the PC board of the performance of the corporation, highlighted the future action plan, elaborated the envisioned initiatives and sought approval, as required under the PC Ordinance 2000, for those initiatives, it added.
The board was of the view that “the potential buyer may be given the choice to introduce reforms as per its business plan and requirements”.
The managements of state-owned enterprises are one of the hurdles in the way of privatisation of loss-making entities.
This week, the federal cabinet finally decided to close SME Bank after all attempts to privatise it failed. It agreed to pay back Rs5.5 billion to the bank’s depositors and also cleared a plan for laying off employees in the second phase.
The HBFC management told the board that it had planned to expand advances to Rs10 billion, by taking expensive loans from the market. The board did not endorse the plan.
The company sought permission for bilateral credit arrangements with the commercial and specialised institutions. HBFC has borrowed money since 2019 from Pakistan Mortgage Refinance Company (PMRC), which is now interested in buying HBFC.
The HBFC management informed the government that it wanted to continue to make investment in technology platforms and related initiatives to enable the company to automate and digitise its processes.
In the middle of privatisation process, HBFC also wanted to hire resources to ensure the induction of new skillsets and the implementation of new and strategic investments.
It wanted to take highly expensive loans for the development of land blocks owned by the company into residential and commercial properties.
The privatisation ministry was of the view that the transaction had reached a sensitive stage now, where potential investors were being considered for pre-qualification prior to the due diligence process.
The company’s proposed actions might have an impact on the balance sheet as well as the enterprise valuation post-due diligence, which might as well affect investor confidence at this critical juncture, it said.
Pre-qualified bidders
The Cabinet Committee on Privatisation (CCOP) conditionally approved the pre-qualification of PMRC and Pakistan Housing Finance Company (PHFC) for participation in the sale of HBFC.
“The board agreed to the recommendation to pre-qualify both the firms to take the process to due diligence stage and meanwhile any further clarification, if required, be sought from the bidders,” said the privatisation ministry.
HBFC has been part of the active privatisation list since 2018. In January 2020, a financial advisory consortium (FAC) comprising MCB Bank, Elixir Securities and EY Ford Rhodes was appointed.
The FAC presented the transaction structure which was approved in December 2020. Afterwards, post-completion of pre-requisites, Expressions of Interest and Statements of Qualification (SOQs) were advertised with the deadline of May 2022.
Four parties submitted the SOQs. However, they either did not provide the necessary information or were not pre-qualified due to technical reasons.
Subsequent to the second marketing exercise, only two parties submitted the SOQs, which were reviewed by the FAC.
The FAC recommended that post-review of the SOQs, after all requirements are fulfilled, PMRC may be pre-qualified and be taken to the next stage.
In the case of PHFC, there appears to be some material gaps with regard to its organisational and management capabilities, consortium agreement signed by Zulfiqar Alain, and not by the authorised signatories and sponsors of PHFC, and the low net worth of PHFC, being the consortium lead.
The board decided that PHFC’s pre-qualification was linked with the completion of information.
Pakistan has assured the International Monetary Fund about early privatisation of HBFC but the matter has taken a longer time, like all other privatisation transactions.

1,Textile industry on verge of default,Asks in letter to SBP governor to allow LC opening as mills are running below 50% capacity,"Unavailability of cotton and curbs on opening Letters of Credit (LCs) for imports have badly impacted exports of the textile industry, causing large-scale unemployment across the sector.
The issue was raised by the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (Aptma) recently in a letter sent to State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Governor Jameel Ahmad. The association warned that the textile industry was on the brink of default as its production and earnings were way below the potential.
In the letter, the textile lobby outlined the major problems besetting the industry. Textile mills are running at less than 50% of their production capacity and so far around seven million people associated with the sector have been rendered jobless.
“The textile sector is closed in the current unfavourable conditions. Consequently, there will be massive unemployment in the country,” said the Aptma letter.
It voiced fear that the industry’s closure would leave more than 10 million people jobless and the country would lose annual export revenue of more than $10 billion.
Aptma pointed out that the local cotton production had remained less than 5 million bales in the current season because of last year’s floods and heavy rains.
Therefore, “the textile industry will have to import at least one million bales of cotton to meet its requirement. However, banks were not opening LCs for import of the required quantity of cotton.”
It cautioned that textile mills were running out of cotton stocks and that the industry would shut down completely owing to the unavailability of raw material.
The association urged the SBP governor to allow the opening of LCs for cotton import, citing that import consignments were stuck at ports, which needed to be released on a priority basis.

2,Industries suffering amid raw material shortage,LCCI president warns that shortages likely to become prominent in Ramazan if not addressed urgently,"The Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) on Tuesday urged the government to formulate a policy on the import of raw material.
In a statement released on Tuesday, acting LCCI President Zafar Mehmood Chaudhry warned, “Industrial closure due to an acute shortage of raw material will be a new phenomenon that is likely to disturb the government in the coming days.”
He said that the banks’ refusal to issue LCs is delaying the industry’s access to raw material. As a result, both the industry’s ability to meet local market demand and volume of exports are declining.
The LCCI president also said that the lack of availability of raw material is forcing businesses to lay off employees and shop owners to stop employing new employees, doubling the rate of unemployment.
He warned that the already strained economy will suffer further if the raw material shortfall issue is not addressed urgently.
“Currently, it seems the government has no specific policy for the import of raw material. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Finance Minister Ishaq Dar should publish a policy declaration to address the pressing problem,” suggested Chaudhry.
He further claimed that the shortage of wheat was causing ‘mayhem’ with workers choosing to stand in line for free flour bags instead of going to work.
“LCCI has repeatedly asked the government to address the LCs problem without success. As the month of Ramzan approaches, a shortage of various items will become apparent as a result of this problem,” he warned, urging the government to look into the matter immediately and find a solution.

3,REER depreciates to 86.4 in Feb despite free market exchange rate,"Rupee inched up 0.04%, or Rs0.11, to close at Rs283.92 against the US dollar","Pakistan’s currency has hit an all-time low against a basket of currencies of trading partner countries, falling to 84.6 on the index in February, as the market-based exchange rate failed to sustain its fair value.
The currency is considered to be at its fair value when it moves in the range of 95-105 on the index. According to data from the State Bank of Pakistan released on Tuesday, the real effective exchange rate (REER) – the value of the local currency compared to the basket of currencies of trading partner countries – depreciated by 7.52 to 86.4 in February 2023 compared to 93.96 in January 2023. The domestic currency closed at Rs261.50 against the US dollar in the interbank market on February 28, 2023. It closed at Rs267.88/$ on January 31, 2023, according to the central bank data.
The government reinstalled the free-market exchange-rate mechanism on the recommendation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to win back its stalled loan program of $6.5 billion and let the rupee find its fair value. The domestic currency, however, failed to sustain at a fair value and got significantly undervalued in the wake of an acute shortage of US dollars in the economy. The historically weak local currency created artificial inflation, but failed to raise the country’s export earnings amid the economic slowdown in the country and export markets in the West.
KASB Securities Head of Research Yousuf Rahman said the REER reading suggests the Pakistani currency has become undervalued. “However, a multi-decade high inflation reading in Pakistan will soon cause the REER to appreciate closer to 100 over the next few months.” To recall, inflation hit a 50-year high at 31.5% in February 2023.
“The REER is calculated by adjusting inflation in the value of the rupee in the country, inflation in the trading partner countries and inflation in common export countries of Pakistan and its trading partner countries,” explained Rahman, adding that, “The inflation reading is estimated to be recorded at 35% in March.”
Usually, food inflation goes up in the holy month of Ramzan, he noted, “This will invite additional inflation in March.”
The inflation reading will remain around 35% in the forthcoming months after Pakistan imposed new taxes worth Rs170 billion, increased the tariff for energy (petrol, power and gas), surged general sales tax (GST) to 18% from 17%, all on the recommendation of the IMF to fix the faltering economy.

In principle, the weakened currency should have boosted the country’s export. However, the partial ban on imports (including by exporters), massive rupee devaluation, high inflation and the high-interest rate did not allow the country’s export to take up. Secondly, Pakistan’s export market which is, by and large, in US and Europe is facing an economic slowdown and their low purchasing power has caused a decrease in demand for local products in the export markets.
Rahman said Pakistan’s REER should stay around 95-96 on the index to narrow down the wide gap between significantly high imports and sluggish exports. The devastation of the cotton crop in the wake of the summer 2022 widespread floods badly impacted the country’s single largest export sector, the textiles.
Some analysts said the REER indicators have become irrelevant in the case of Pakistan as it is moving down amid the choke of supply of the US dollar in the economy against controlled demand for imports. Rahman, however, said “the revival of the IMF program is the only option to come out of the economic and financial crisis”. It may, however, take time as the government is to take financial commitments worth $6-7 billion from friendly countries to resume the program.
The local currency inched up 0.04%, or Rs0.11, to close at Rs283.92 against the US dollar in the interbank market on Tuesday. Despite the current state of the Pakistani currency, Rahman predicts that the local currency will recover to Rs275/$ after the IMF program is revived.
In conclusion, the reinstatement of the market-based exchange rate in late January has caused Pakistan’s currency to fall to an all-time low against a basket of currencies of trading partner countries. While the weakened currency should have boosted the country’s export, factors such as high inflation, the high-interest rate, and the economic slowdown in the country and export markets in the West did not allow the country’s export to take up. The revival of the IMF program is seen as the only option to come out of the economic and financial crisis, though it may take time as the government seeks financial commitments from friendly countries to resume the program.

4,Tax incentives demanded,Businesswomen urged SMEDA to work on strategy,"Pakistan’s women entrepreneurs have unanimously called for a separate entrepreneurship policy for women in the country. The demand came up at an online consultative session arranged by SMEDA, and was attended by female entrepreneurs from across the country. 
The entrepreneurs complained that women have no special tax incentives and that they bear a burden of over 45% in taxes.
To help increase women’s participation in the economy they suggested female-led start-ups be provided with a tax holiday up to five years, coupled with a tax credit mechanism to ensure sustainability. Unanimously agreeing that the goal of women empowerment cannot be achieved without incentives and facilities, they demanded an exclusive entrepreneurship strategy and urged SMEDA to support their vision.

5,‘Strong IPR system required for economic growth’,Businessmen urge govt to ensure strict enforcement of IPR laws,"Karachi business leaders are advocating for a strong intellectual property rights (IPR) system in Pakistan, supported by technology, to harness the country’s resources and expand its wealth.
President of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), Mohammed Tariq Yousuf, welcomed Chairman of the Intellectual Property Organisation (IPO), Farrukh Amil, stating that due to global integration, a competitive environment and technological advancements, the role of the IPO is critical for the country’s economic development but there is a need to ensure strict enforcement of IPR laws at the grass root levels. “A strong foundation for a vibrant IP system is needed to increase national wealth,” he said.
The IPO chairman expressed his commitment to simplifying IP procedures through digitalisation under the IPO’s long-term strategy. He emphasised the need to simplify cumbersome IP procedures to allow individuals and companies to register their products, services, and other exclusive material using their smartphones, as is done in developed countries worldwide.
According to Arif Habib Commodities CEO Ahsan Mehanti, “IPR rules are less effective in Pakistan due to lax punishments and incompetent law enforcement agencies.” He added that implementing stronger IPR laws will benefit small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and multinational enterprises (MNEs) by attracting talent and promoting a long-term business mindset. Mehanti also noted that well-known brands like Pepsi and Coke and prescription medications have been violated in the past, but implementing IPR rules will reduce pressure from citizens and civil rights organisations and increase foreign direct investment (FDI).
Lasbela Chamber of Commerce and Industry EFP President, Ismail Suttar suggested that Pakistan learn from other countries’ IPR systems, particularly South Korea, which excels in all spheres of society. He cited a delegation’s visit to South Korea 19 years ago to learn about the IPO’s wonderful system, which he believes will benefit Pakistan.
Recently, President of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), Irfan Iqbal Sheikh, demanded that the government establish a world-class and central intellectual property house to better protect the intellectual property rights (IPRs) of the R&D fraternity, manufacturers, and exporters. He also highlighted the importance of Trade-related aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) to penetrate deeper into the EU, UK, Australian, Japanese, South Korean, and North American export markets.
The IPO chairman acknowledged that intellectual property is a neglected subject in Pakistan as many people are unaware of the significance of trademarks, copyrights, and patents. He believes that introducing an IP-related curriculum in schools is necessary, as is done in many other countries. Currently, only Pakistani university students who choose to pursue specialised courses or degrees and the legal fraternity are aware of the importance of intellectual property, while the general public remains unaware.
He further emphasised the critical need for strict enforcement of IPR laws, including heavier fines and stricter punishments to protect producers’ interests and save the public from counterfeit products. He noted that even fake medicines and foodstuff are widely produced, putting the lives of poor citizens at risk. Heavier fines and dire consequences for breaking the law will act as a huge deterrent to counterfeiting.

6,Bitcoin passes the bank stress test,"Bitcoin has risen 21% this month, while a choppy S&P 500 has lost 1.4% and gold has gained 8%","As crisis stalks the traditional world of stocks and bonds, bitcoin is suddenly looking like a safe haven.
The infamously volatile cryptocurrency seems positively hale and hearty, just as a banking meltdown drives markets into the arms of a recession.
Bitcoin has risen 21% this month, while a choppy S&P 500 has lost 1.4% and gold has gained 8%.
“If you were going to describe an environment where there were successive bank runs because central banks are trying to fight inflation with fast rate increases, that is pretty close to as spot-on a thesis for owning bitcoin as you’ve ever heard,” said Stéphane Ouellette, CEO FRNT Financial.
The cryptocurrency has, for now, severed its ties with stocks and bonds and tagged on to a rally in gold, fulfilling at least one part of creator Satoshi Nakamoto’s dream – that bitcoin can serve as a refuge for suffering investors.
Bitcoin’s 30-day correlation with the S&P 500 has slid to negative 0.12 over the past week, where a measure of 1 indicates the two assets are moving in lock step. It remains to be seen if bitcoin’s bullishness will endure as attention shifts to the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting this week.

7,Bills of residential LNG consumers swell to Rs200b,"In absence of legal framework, gas utilities fail to make recoveries","The decisions of different governments to divert expensive liquefied natural gas (LNG) to the residential consumers in winter in a bid to address gas shortages have resulted in piling up of huge consumer bills of Rs200 billion.
In the absence of a legal framework, the two public gas utilities running in the country have failed to recover the LNG bills from domestic consumers.
Pakistan State Oil (PSO) imports around eight to nine LNG cargoes per month from Qatar. Under the term contracts, the delivered cost of each cargo for February 2023, at the rate of $12.7148 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), comes to $41 million. The cumulative financial impact of nine cargoes imported in a month will be $369 million.
Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL), which has not been able to recover the LNG cost from domestic consumers, has to pay Rs492 billion to PSO on account of LNG supplies. This has sparked fears of disruption to LNG imports.
According to officials, LNG diversion to the domestic sector in winter always carries some tariff differential, which accumulated to a total of Rs200 billion up to February 2023. However, the budgetary subsidy to cover the differential is only Rs25 billion for the current fiscal year.
The Petroleum Division has so far released Rs12.50 billion after approval of the Finance Division.
On average, the power sector consumes up to 70% of re-gasified LNG whereas the remaining is supplied to the exporting and non-exporting industry, fertiliser manufacturers, commercial consumers, compressed natural gas (CNG) filling stations, cement firms and domestic consumers.
SNGPL provides RLNG to the exporting industry and fertiliser manufacturers at subsidised rates and their recovery is contingent upon the budgetary subsidy.
In the case of exporting industry, Rs40 billion has been allocated for subsidy in FY23, which is sufficient to meet the SNGPL’s requirement.
There were pending claims of Rs26.059 billion for the subsidised RLNG supply to two fertiliser plants, ie Fatima Fertiliser and Agritech Limited, till January 3, 2023, when the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) decided to discontinue the subsidised supplies.
For the provision of RLNG to the power sector, payments to SNGPL were also overdue, which were not being fully realised timely.
In a recent meeting, the Petroleum Division informed the ECC that PSO had given an SOS call for releasing funds as the company’s liquidity position was under severe stress.
Its receivables had soared to an all-time high of Rs773 billion, most of which were owed by SNGPL, which had to pay Rs498 billion.
On the other hand, PSO’s borrowing had reached Rs411 billion, leading to a higher finance cost of Rs43 billion in the current fiscal year and the projected Rs73 billion for next year, which would completely erode the company’s profit.
As per contracts with LNG suppliers, PSO is required to clear an invoice on the 15th day after completion of cargo unloading and/or the 10th banking day after receipt of invoice from the supplier, whichever is later.
The release of budgetary subsidy is being delayed by the Finance Division owing to the constrained fiscal space and the limit on expenditures. This has led to the accumulation of subsidies of Rs14.45 billion for the exporting sector and the diversion of RLNG.
It may be recalled that the ECC, in its meeting held on January 3, 2023, considered and approved a summary of the Petroleum Division on the borrowing of Rs50 billion in favour of PSO backed by sovereign guarantee.
PSO was in the process of borrowing funds as the Letter of Comfort was lately issued by the Finance Division on February 16, 2023.
However, the company was of the view that even after the recent arrangement, there was not much improvement in its liquidity requirement, which may result in default on the international payment obligations.
