0,PTI pins its hopes on three CJs,Next two months crucial for party in terms of judicial decisions,"As the PTI is crying foul on the executive actions against their party leaders as well as the delay in the elections in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab, the role of three chief justices will be crucial in the next couple of months.
Under the law, every chief justice is the master of the roster and has a discretionary power in the fixation of cases.
As the PTI leaders and its activists are facing a tough time from the executive authorities, the party is eyeing its hope on three chief justices -- CJP Umar Ata Bandial, Lahore High Court Chief Justice Ameer Bhatti and Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Aamer Farooq to acquire relief in matters related to violation of human rights as well as the delay in elections in the two provinces.
CJP Bandial has already taken notice of the delay in the elections in Punjab and K-P.
Despite the judges' internal controversies, CJP Bandial has passed directions to announce the date of elections in the two provinces.
President Dr Arif Alvi, who belongs to the PTI, has given a date to hold elections in Punjab.
Likewise, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has given a schedule for the Punjab polls.
However, the K-P governor has not announced the date of elections in his province. The PTI has filed a contempt petition against him.
However, uncertainty still remains as whether or not elections in Punjab will be held on April 30 as scheduled.
The executive authorities are reluctant to hold elections in both the provinces.
The federal government is giving excuses not to set aside nearly Rs60 billion needed for holding the elections -- and it is actually facing a shortage of funds in the current year.
A government official said in case of a supplementary grant, parliament has to pass a bill -- an unlikely development in the prevailing situation.
Now all eyes are on CJP Bandial as to whether or not he will compel the government to arrange the funds for the elections as well as provide them with security.
The PTI is willing to talk with political parties to hold the elections for the National and provincial assemblies on one date.
Recently, PTI chief and deposed premier Imran Khan wrote two letters to CJP Bandial for taking notice of the issues related to civil liberties faced by him and other party leaders.
With the PTI leaders facing a tough time at the hands of the ‘powerful circles’, a debate has started whether or not CJP Bandial would give relief to the party in the next couple of months.
Justice Bandial is himself facing internal challenges within the institution.
First, the Supreme Court judges are divided on ideological lines.
Secondly, audio leaks are being released to indulge a few SC judges.
It is witnessed that one section of the judiciary is facing immense pressure from both inside and outside after the release of their video and audio recordings.
Superior bars, wherein the Independent Lawyers Group is in majority, are also accusing the CJP of protecting one SC judge, who is facing allegations of “favouring” the PTI.
The Professional Lawyers Group is silent in the prevailing situation. Although a few representatives of this group are backing the SC judge.
All matters related to the eligibility of Imran will ultimately land in the IHC.
A debate has also started as how IHC CJ Farooq would deal with these matters.
In comparison with former IHC CJ Athar Minallah, the PTI is unable to acquire relief in matters related to civil liberties during Justice Farooq's tenure as the chief justice of the high court.
However, a PTI lawyer said the party had managed to obtain some relief from the IHC in the last couple of weeks.
“This is a positive development for the PTI,” he added.
The PTI is also facing a difficult time because of the caretaker government of Punjab.
The party has so far to managed to acquire some relief from the LHC since the last one year.
It is not yet clear as whether or not the PTI will continue to obtain relief from the LHC in the next couple of months.

1,IHC rejects FIA’s plea to cancel Imran’s bail in funding case,Court seeks report in contempt of court proceedings against PTI chief,"The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has rejected the Federal Investigation Agency’s (FIA) plea to cancel the bail of PTI chief Imran Khan in the prohibited funding case.
A two-member bench comprising Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri conducted the hearing on the plea on Wednesday, reported Express News.
The court also rejected the request to cancel the bail of co-accused Tariq Shafi.
The FIA had filed an application in the IHC on Feb 28 against the banking court’s decision to grant bail to the PTI chief and appealed the court to annul the decision as it was “against the law”.
During the course of hearing, FIA Special Prosecutor Rizwan Abbasi argued that Imran Khan has not yet been interrogated by the agency in the case, asking the court to cancel his bail.
IHC Chief Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani asked if money laundering allegations in the FIR were against Arif Naqvi and Imran Khan or Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) was the recipients of the funds.
The FIA counsel said that Imran Khan in a recent interview admitted that he received funds for charity purposes but used them for political activities.
Justice Kayani inquired that if the money was used by a political party then how it became personal belonging. The FIA lawyer said it was a crime to send charity money through someone else's foreign account.
Justice Kayani asked the FIA counsel to submit the letter of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) that the investigation agency received during the investigation. “You did not include the employee of the State Bank in the investigation. Changing the name of a bank account is not a crime. Has State Bank taken any action to change the name or nature of account?” the judge inquired.
The FIA lawyer replied that the relevant record of UBL bank is missing and a written response was sought from the SBP, which they have provided.
The court remarked that keeping records are the responsibility of the bank and PTI did not take them. “Did Imran Khan sign the nature of account change form?” the judge asked.
The FIA lawyer said that Younis Ali, Tariq Shafi and Sardar Azhar Tariq signed the form to change the nature of the account.
“This is a white collar crime. We have to investigate a lot of things,” he added.
However, Justice Kayani pointed that nature of account had not been changed and added that the entire case comes under the ambit of the SBP.
“What is Imran Khan's relationship with Tariq Shafi? What money has Imran Khan been withdrawing? Who is the signatory of this account? This account belongs to Tehreek-e-Insaf, so the Committee of Tehreek-e-Insaf has to run it. How did Imran Khan become beneficiary?” the judge inquired.
FIA prosecutor Raja Rizwan Abbasi replied that Imran Khan is the chairman of the party, hence he is the beneficiary.
Contempt case
The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday directed concerned authorities to submit a security report over the law and order situation created during Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief Imran Khan's visit to the Federal Judicial Complex (FJC) last week.
Chief Justice (CJ) IHC Justice Aamer Farooq was presiding over a hearing in relation to a contempt of court petition filed against Imran Assistant Commissioner (AC) Abdullah Khan through his lawyer Rizwan Abbasi.
In his petition, AC Khan has maintained that Imran had been ordered by the court not to create a law and order situation, ""but he breached those orders"".
The AC said that the police had made security arrangements in accordance with court orders while PTI workers pelted stones at the police deployed outside the FJC, owing to which several law enforcement personnel sustained injuries.
During the proceedings at the IHC today, the court ordered IG Islamabad and concerned authorities of the local administration to submit a report on the events of March 18.
The court adjourned proceedings until April 7 and also consolidated the case with an ongoing case being heard by the IHC probing into the missing Toshakhana case file.
Last week, as the PTI chief had made his way to Justice Zafar Iqbal's court, police and Imran's supporters clashed for several hours.
Amidst the chaos, Imran was allowed by the court to sign his documents from his vehicle parked outside the courtroom where his indictment was to be decided.
The ex-premier's chief of staff Shibli Faraz had taken the order sheet to get Imran's signature alongside SP Malik, however, upon his return, the file had been reported missing.
Ultimately, the PTI chief was allowed to leave after marking his attendance without being indicted because of clashes between police and party activists outside the FJC.

2,'Murtaza Bhutto-style murder' planned for me: Imran,"Punjab police may conduct another operation at Zaman Park in the evening or tomorrow, claims PTI chief","Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan has once again sounded alarms that he was in the crosshairs as another plan was hatched to take aim at his life “either today or tomorrow” outside Zaman Park – his Lahore residence that remains a hotbed of ongoing political drama.
The former prime minister claimed the PDM government was planning to assassinate him at his residence like Murtaza Bhutto through a police operation.
Addressing his supporters through a video link from his Zaman Park residence in on Wednesday, Imran named the Inspector General (IG) Punjab, the IG Islamabad and the “handlers” for conceiving a plan to set the stage for a fake police encounter against him.
“Today or tomorrow the Punjab police were planning to carry out another operation at Zaman Park (Khan’s residence) after infiltrating their men in our crowd. These men would kill four to five policemen to provide a justification to the Punjab Police for retaliation. Subsequently, I would be killed in an encounter amid the mayhem,” he said.
However, he appealed to his workers and supporters to show restraint in case of a police crackdown. “You should not respond to police brutality and remain peaceful at all costs. ""The police would prompt you to become violent and use it as a pretext to come hard on us, but all the PTI supporters should not respond and allow the police to enter my home if they arrive with a new arrest warrant against me.""
 “I am ready to be arrested, but I would not let my people die. I am not concerned about my possible arrest, but I am concerned about my workers. The judiciary should protect our rights,” he said.
He reiterated that he was lucky to escape the assassination attempt in Islamabad during his visit to the Judicial Complex to attend a court hearing. He averred that the police tried to entice their supporter by throwing stones at them to create mayhem and set the stage to kill him. He claimed that he received information from inside the police that ‘unknown’ people disguised in uniforms of the Counter Terrorism Department were deputed at the place and they also told him about what was about to happen against him.

“All the footage of close circuit TV was mysteriously removed from the Judicial Complex while the IG scolded the policemen for allowing me to leave the complex,” he said, claiming that the IG was involved in the assassination attempt on him in Islamabad.
Khan alleged that the government attacked his residence as if a terrorist was hiding there. He further claimed that his party workers were separated from the rally and were being arrested while the police pelted stones from the roof outside the court during his appearance at the Islamabad court. “I was mentally prepared to be arrested in Islamabad,” he added.
Khan also accused the ruling coalition of trying to oust his PTI party from the elections, as they feared that their interests would be compromised if he returns the power. “The money they (the rulers) have stashed abroad was more than the money they were asking from the International Monetary Fund (IMF),” he added.
The former premier said that the inept rulers were destabilising the country and were the least concerned about what happens in the country, as their interests lie abroad. Their only concern right now was looting the national wealth and hence, they want to remove him, he added.
He urged the people not to abandon the struggle for their rights even if he was killed; “the rulers would make all efforts to make you their slaves, treat you like animals and thus deny you of your right to freedom. Break the shackle of fear and reclaim your right to freedom. If the incumbent rulers continue to stay at the helm, then the masses would have no future in this country,” he added.
Khan also announced holding a public gathering at Minar-e-Pakistan on Saturday night where he would unveil the party's future line of action.

3,Rashid says govt’s anti-PTI plans will fail,AML chief says two of his phones returned by unidentified persons while three still remain in police custody,"Commenting on the crackdown launched on the PTI workers, Awami Muslim League (AML) chief Sheikh Rashid on Tuesday observed that the incumbent government was bent upon “eliminating” Imran Khan and his party from politics but noted that they would not succeed in doing so.
Addressing the media, Rashid called upon the relevant quarters to respect public opinion. He said the country was going through the worst economic crisis and the people only demanded fair elections.
“It is possible that they want to ban the PTI. Arresting Imran Khan is not an issue but they want to kill him,” he said.
The AML chief noted that the government neither had candidates nor polling agents, adding that the incumbent regime was not even prepared for the polls.
He vowed to support the PTI chief saying, only Imran was ready for elections.
Rashid further said that last night unidentified people left two of his phones at his residence while three mobiles were still in their custody.
Last month, the Islamabad High Court granted bail to the AML chief in a case pertaining to his allegations against PPP Co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari for plotting to assassinate the PTI chief.
He also appeared in the court while submitting a plea seeking registration of a case against the Aabpara police station officials for not returning his belongings, including mobile phones, confiscated at the time of his arrest.

4,Over 10m lack access to safe water in flood-hit areas,Unicef says Pakistani children’s needs must be prioritised in flood recovery plans,"More than 10 million people, including children, living in flood-affected areas remained deprived of safe drinking water, the United Nation’s agency for children warned on Tuesday, six months after the devastating floods ravaged parts of Pakistan.
On the eve of World Water Day, Unicef said in a new release that the floods damaged most of water systems in affected areas, forcing more than 5.4 million people, including 2.5 million children, to solely rely on contaminated water from ponds and wells.
“Six months after catastrophic floods … more than 10 million people, including children, living in flood-affected areas remain deprived of safe drinking water, leaving families with no alternative but to drink and use potentially disease-ridden water,” it said.
Even before the floods, the news release said, despite the country’s drinking water supply system covering 92% of the population, only 36% of the water was considered safe for consumption.
“Safe drinking water is not a privilege, it is a basic human right,” said Abdullah Fadil, the Unicef representative in Pakistan. “Yet, every day, millions of girls and boys in Pakistan are fighting a losing battle against preventable waterborne diseases and the consequential malnutrition,” he continued.
“We need the continued support of our donors to provide safe water, build toilets and deliver vital sanitation services to these children and families who need them the most,” Fadil added.
The prolonged lack of safe drinking water and toilets, along with the continued proximity of vulnerable families to bodies of stagnant water are contributing to the widespread outbreaks of waterborne diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea, dengue, and malaria.
At the same time, open defecation has increased by more than 14% in the flood-affected regions. To make matters worse, the lack of proper toilets is disproportionally affecting children, adolescent girls and women who are at added risk of shame and harm.
Besides, unsafe water and poor sanitation are key underlying causes of malnutrition. The associated diseases, such as diarrhoea, prevent children from getting the vital nutrients they need.
“Malnourished children are more susceptible to waterborne diseases due to already weakened immune system, which simply perpetuates a vicious cycle of malnutrition and infection,” the news release warned.
Tragically, it added, one-third of all child deaths globally are attributable to malnutrition and half of all undernutrition cases were linked to infections caused by a lack of access to safe water, adequate sanitation and good hygiene.
“In Pakistan, malnutrition is associated with half of all child deaths. In flood affected areas, more than 1.5 million boys and girls are already severely malnourished, and the numbers will only rise in the absence of safe water and proper sanitation.”
Unicef has been on the ground with partners since the first day of the climate-induced floods hit Sindh, Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces. After the floods, Unicef has installed numerous hand-pumps and water storage facilities.
In the past six months, Unicef has also distributed hygiene kits to more than 1.3 million people besides supporting the rehabilitation and rebuilding of water supply facilities, benefiting over 450,000 people.
Ahead of World Water Day, Unicef called upon the government, donors and partners to urgently allocate resources to restore access to safe drinking water and toilets and invest in climate-resilient safe drinking water supply facilities.
“It is imperative that the voices and the needs of children in Pakistan are prioritised at all costs and that children are placed at the heart of all post-flood recovery and resilience plans,” said Fadil.
Unicef said that more than 9.6 million children still required access to essential social services even six months after the devastating floods. However, its appeal of $173.5 million remained less than 50% funded.

5,"Minorities property worth Rs27b recovered, SC told","HRCP head seeks court's help to push provincial govts to cooperate, release asset details","Head of the Minority Rights Commission Shoaib Sadal on Tuesday informed the Supreme Court that until now property belonging to minorities worth Rs27 billion had been recovered from illegal possession.
Sadal also told the two-judge bench headed by Justice Ijazul Ahsan that the provincial governments were not cooperating with the Commission regarding the details of assets.
He requested the apex court to direct the provincial governments and their police chiefs in that regard.
Sadal informed the bench, which was hearing a suo motu case regarding the rights of minorities, that the Commission had also submitted its reply to the court.
Justice Ahsan remarked that the court would hear the answers of all respondents together.
Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) lawyer Hafiz Ahsan Ahmed said that several assets of the ETPB had been illegally occupied in various cities, which could not be retrieved despite many attempts.
Representative of Hindu Council Dr Ramesh Kumar alleged that the ETPB was showing a “dhram shala” as a commercial property.
A detailed report about the property of Auqaf Department was also submitted to the bench.
The case was subsequently adjourned for an indefinite time.

6,‘EMS’ to help ROs gather poll results,ECP briefed on progress in setting up control centre,"The electoral watchdog on Tuesday was informed by its information technology team that the Election Management System (EMS) would facilitate returning officers (ROs) in gathering results of the general polls to be held later this year.
The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) held a huddle, presided over by Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja, at its secretariat in Islamabad to review the arrangements for the general polls 2023.
The meeting's participants, who included the commission’s members and special and additional secretaries, were briefed on the information technology projects undertaken by ECP’s experts for the upcoming general elections.
They were informed that the EMS would allow the results of the polls to be screened live at the offices of the ROs, provincial ECPs, Election Commission's Secretariat as well as to the media and contesting candidates.
The participants of the meeting were also given a briefing on the progress of the setting up of the Election Management Control Centre. The aim of establishing the centre is monitoring the stages before polling, the day of voting and the process after that.
The ECP was also informed about the setting up of the Scrutiny Facilitation Centre for the ROs.
This project has been set up in collaboration with the State Bank of Pakistan, Federal Investigation Agency, National Accountability Bureau (NAB), National Database and Registration Authority, and Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR).
Through this online system, the data and other relevant information about the candidates was verified.
Using this project, a candidate’s information about dual nationality, bank defaulting as well as FBR and NAB cases could be provided to the ROs instantly.
This information assists the ROs in the process of scrutiny so that they could decide on the nomination papers on time.
Through this system, the data of 8,595 candidates was verified through the institutions and provided to the ROs.
The participants of the huddle were also informed about the monitoring system that would be used during the general elections.
They were further told that a control room would be set up for timely  monitoring of electoral process.
The district administrations, law enforcement agencies, and representatives of the ROs would be present in the control room.
For the first time, the ECP would share UAN and WhatsApp numbers with the public for instant access to information and lodging of complaints.
The people and candidates will be able to send their complaints in the form of messages along with videos and pictures to the commission.
The ECP would ensure immediate action on these complaints.

7,Tyrian White case: Arguments on maintainability completed,"Details of dependents, not children, required in nomination papers: IHC","The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday said that details of dependents, and not children, were required to be mentioned in the nomination papers.
The court was hearing arguments on the maintainability of a petition seeking disqualification of PTI Chairman Imran Khan for concealing his alleged daughter Tyrian White.
A three-member larger bench of the IHC led by Chief Justice Aamir Farooq heard the case.
The petitioner’s counsel completed his arguments on the maintainability of the plea.
The IHC chief justice said that the details of dependents and not children were required to be given in the nomination papers. He said even if Imran accepts Tyrian as his daughter the petition would have to be seen from legal aspects.
Petitioner’s lawyer Hamid Ali Shah argued that the PTI chief had mentioned Bushra Bibi as his wife, and his sons, Suleman and Qasim living with his former wife in the affidavit that he had submitted along with the nomination papers.
He said Imran had further stated that his sons were residing with their mother in the United Kingdom and were not dependent on him.
The sons certainly would not be dependent on Imran Khan but the daughter is as she is unmarried, the petitioner’s counsel argued.
He said mentioning the names of two children while not disclosing the name of the third one was considered malicious intent.
The IHC chief justice remarked that even if Imran accepts Tyrian as his daughter the petition will not be approved legally.
He said the legal requirements of the affidavit will also have to be seen.
He said here the word dependent had been used, and not children, asking whether some children could be dependent while others not.
The PTI chairman’s counsel Salman Akram Raja replied that Imran’s children were earlier dependent but not now.
He said Imran had mentioned the name of his children for clarity purpose otherwise the names of those who are not dependents are not even disclosed.
The petitioner’s counsel contended that the PTI chief should also have mentioned the name of his alleged daughter at the time of mentioning the names of his sons.
He argued that if someone is accused, he should deny the allegations.
The court adjourned the hearing of the case till March 29 after the petitioner’s counsel completed his arguments.

8,"Imran, party leaders face a record 130 FIRs",LHC hears PTI chief’s plea seeking details of cases,"A record 130 First Information Reports (FIRs) were registered against Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan and his other party leaders.
It was revealed before the Lahore High Court on Wednesday which was hearing a plea filed by the former prime minister seeking details of the FIRs registered against him and other PTI workers.
The FIRs were registered by the Punjab and Islamabad police and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).
Meanwhile, LHC’s Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh directed the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and the Anti-Corruption Establishment to submit the record of FIRs from their departments by March 24.
According to the records, out of a total of 130 FIRs, 35 were registered against Imran.
The Punjab police registered a total of 84 FIRs against PTI leadership and workers but nominated Imran Khan in six. Islamabad police registered 43 FIRs against party workers, with 28 against Imran and the FIA registered three FIRs with Imran mentioned in one.
As proceedings commenced, the petitioner's counsel, Advocate Azhar Siddique, drew the court’s attention towards the rapid increase in the number of FIRs registered against Imran and the PTI.
He contended that there were 56 FIRs in Punjab and 33 in Islamabad till yesterday which increased to 84 and 43 respectively.
NAB sought some time to submit the relevant report, irking Justice Sheikh who questioned what the accountability watchdog was doing since yesterday.
NAB’s representative replied that they found out today about the requisite document and that the accountability watchdog was not given the petitioner’s copy, therefore could not respond without reading the petition.
Siddique argued NAB had been written to twice but the bureau and Anti-Corruption are reluctant to submit the record before the court.
Justice Sheikh then asked the anti-corruption wing how many cases were registered against Imran Khan, and expressed dismay after receiving a non-satisfactory answer. He maintained that it appeared NAB and the anti-corruption wing were not cooperating.

Under the umbrella of the Prime Minister’s Youth Development Initiatives, as many as 15 programmes were launched by Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal at a ceremony here.
The youth programme was rolled out as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif launched the ‘Teleschool Pakistan App, Google for Education and Digital Continuous Professional Development’ initiative to further revolutionise the formal education medium in Pakistan.
The Youth Development Package includes 60,000 paid internships, technical and vocational trainings for 100,000 youth, distribution of 100,000 laptops, provision of 5,000 scholarships for the students of Balochistan and erstwhile tribal areas.
