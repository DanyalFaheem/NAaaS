0,The quest for heritage,"Today, the Lahore Heritage Club is not only an institution but also a community of likeminded people","History remains alive as long as its remembrance continues. Museums serve as a gateway to a different time, and the relics preserved therein reveal stories of a distant past. Together, these relics contribute to the cultural capital. Institutions of various scales play a crucial role in preserving culture. Although their preferences may differ from one another, they ultimately contribute to the preservation of history in various forms.
For many people, a city is merely a place they live in, until they head out. For others, it is a place that resides within them, rather than the other way around. However, for some people, a city can take the form of a beloved, whose remembrance they long to preserve. Lahore, a city with an enchanting history, has such a place in the lives of those who love it to the core of their hearts.
In the heart of the city, there is a house that boasts a private collection comprising some of Lahore’s finest relics. To a casual onlooker, the collection may seem like a compilation of random historical artefacts, but to careful observers, each artefact represents a different stage in the city’s timeline. This place is not a museum and is not open to the public, but it still attracts visitors who want to catch a glimpse of the city that Lahore was.
The brainchild of Tahir Yazdani Malik, the Lahore Heritage Club, as the place came to be known, continues to be the city’s best kept secret. Mr Yazdani, who passed away in 2019, did not set out to be a collector, rather he was an admirer of culture and was deeply in love with the city’s heritage.
“Taking keen interest in Lahore's diverse and rich history and culture, he started collecting artifacts and antiques, which soon took up a portion of his house,” his daughter, Zarafshaan Tahir, tells The Express Tribune.
“Exploring Lahore's nooks and corners was like a pilgrimage to him; he loved meeting new people, establishing roots everywhere, learning about each and every person's ancestral past, and deepening his understanding of the unique traditions of diverse families along the way,” she adds
According to his daughter, it was his passion and deep fascination for the multifaceted city led him to preserve Pakistan's heritage and cultural crafts via this project, primarily via social media.
“He wanted to display the cultures and the history of a city that was slowly being turned into a concrete jungle,” she says.
Mr Yazdani’s efforts precede the formation of the Walled City of Lahore Authority (WCLA). While he was still collecting relics in the early 2000s, he created an active community for the preservation of the city’s history and for the dissemination of its cultural knowledge across the globe.
Today, the Lahore Heritage Club serves as an institution and a community of like-minded people who come together for various events to celebrate the city’s culture. Its artefacts are displayed on an entire floor of Mr. Yazdani’s sprawling house. Many visitors have likened the place to a maze, as they navigate through its corridors looking for the crown jewels that are subtly placed here and there.
Mr Yazdani’s children, Zarafshaan, Zareen and Alisher Tahir, run the institute together. They receive hundreds of requests for visits regularly, but due to logistical limitations, only open it to a limited number of guests.
Alisher continues the guided tours the way his father once did. He eagerly welcomes visitors interested in hearing Lahore’s story and guides them through the various sections of the collection. Zarafshaan lead the institute’s efforts to encourage thought-provoking exchanges between people from all walks of life. Zareen, the youngest of the three siblings, is the primary influence behind poetry nights and open mics aimed at young adults.
Mr Yazdani’s legacy continues with his children as the Lahore Heritage Club now explores new avenues to cater to different audiences in the city.
“What he wanted was to make Lahore the cultural hub it once was, which I believe it now is – something that is clearly discernible through LLF (Lahore Literary Festival), Rafi Peer festivals, and small collectives working towards other similar initiatives,” Ms Zarafshaan says.

1,UAF engineers new sugarcane variants,New pest-resistant crops will aid agricultural sector,"University of Agriculture Faisalabad (UAF) announced that it has developed two high-yielding and insect resistant varieties of sugarcane. 
The new variants, insect-resistant transgenic sugarcane (CABB-IRS) and herbicide-tolerant transgenic sugarcane (CABB-HTS), were approved for field trials by the National Biosafety Committee (NBC) of Ministry of Climate Change upon recommendations from the IBC, UAF and TAC Pak-EPA.
The varieties were developed by Dean Faculty of Agriculture Faisalabad Prof Dr Muhammad Sarwar Khan and his team from the Centre of Agricultural Biochemistry and Biotechnology. UAF Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Iqrar Ahmad Khan congratulated the team and hoped that it would be a milestone for sugarcane production. 
Pakistan is the 11th largest producer of sugarcane in the world and between 2021 and 2022, sugarcane production increased to 88.65 million tons from 81.009 million tons. Average sugarcane production in the country is 45-50 metric tons/ha, which is very low compared to the average global yield which is around 60 metric tons/ha. Two serious yield-limiting agents are weeds and pests.
The most damaging insect-pests of sugarcane are top borer, stem borer, gurdaspur borer, root borer, which may cause up to 50 percent of yield losses.

7,Fund shortage hits rural water projects,Construction of Aab-e-Pak centres for thousands of villages delayed,"Projects launched for supplying clean water in districts across Punjab are facing delays due to the freezing of funds.
While the authorities appear to be focusing on improving the situation in the big cities like Lahore, Faisalabad and Rawalpindi, the conditions in the rural areas remain unaddressed.
In view of the risk of intestinal and skin diseases caused by contaminated water, the Punjab government had started construction of Aab-e-Pak centres to supply clean water to about 10.5 million people of more than 25,000 villages.
However, the work launched under the Aab-e-Pak Authority has stopped due to freezing of funds.
The preceding provincial government had created the Aab-e-Pak Authority to provide clean water. 
In the first phase, 1,235 Aab-e-Pak centres were to be built in cities and villages in the Lahore, Sargodha, Dera Ghazi Khan, Multan, Sahiwal and Faisalabad divisions at a cost of about Rs4.5 billion. But only 900 centres could be built.
Due to shortage of funds, the project has been delayed since June last year.
The second phase of the project will cover more than 1,000 villages across the province.
According to sources, work to build 110 Marakaz-e-Aab at a cost of Rs5 billion has also been delayed till next year.
However, the Aab-e-Pak Authority’s former chief executive officer Zahid Aziz, said the work on phased projects to provide clean drinking water to the people was also being pursued under the local government department, Punjab city programmes, Punjab Rural Aab Rasani Programme and intermediate cities programme. 
Speaking to The Express Tribune, he said water should be used with care, so that the reservoirs could be protected for future generations.
Lahore Water a d Sanitation Agency (WASA) Managing Director Ghufran Ahmed said the World Health Organisation (WHO) had set a standard of 95 per cent of water samples collected from a city to be found safe in tests.
“Our water testing laboratory is approved under the ISO 1725 standards,” he added.
The official said chlorinators were also being used at tube wells to provide clean water to the people after eliminating germs. He said the complaints of contaminated water were also resulting from citizens using rotten pipelines and dirty tanks. 
With the cooperation of the Punjab government, the old decayed pipelines are being replaced in a phased manner, which will improve the water quality.
He also appealed to the citizens to avoid wasting water.
According to sources, WASA is providing water to a population of eight million, while more than 4.4 million residents of the provincial capital are getting water from other sources.
About 6,000 kilometres of water supply lines in the city have completed their viability period, of which about 40 per cent have been replaced.
The rest of the damaged pipelines could not be replaced due to non-availability of funds. The contamination of water in the damaged pipelines is posing a health risk to the citizens of the affected areas.
