0,Pay salaries of Malakand teachers: PHC CJ,"CJ Rashid tells education secretary to ensure payment as Ramazan is
approaching","The Peshawar High Court has ordered the education secretary to ensure the payment of salaries to all those teachers who meet the education department’s criteria, saying that Ramazan is approaching and it is not good not to pay them and submit a report till Tuesday.
A two-member bench comprising Chief Justice Qaisar Rashid and Justice Ijaz Anwar heard a writ petition filed against the non-payment of salaries to teachers of Basic Education Community Schools Malakand. As the proceedings began, the counsel for the petitioners apprised the court that the teachers had not been getting their salaries for 20 months.
The chief justice wondered that there was money to pay the officers but none for the teachers. “Call the education secretary, director and advocate general. The court will resume hearing of this case shortly.” After recess when the court resumed, the education secretary, director, and Assistant Advocate General Syed Sikandar Hayat Shah appeared in court.
The education secretary apprised the court that these schools were given to them by the federal government without any funding. “There are a total of 1,531 schools with 1,631 teachers.” He said that most of the teachers had intermediate and matriculation degrees and “our requirement is BA (Bachelor of Arts)”. The secretary said that many schools had been established by people in their living rooms where three to five children were studying.
The chief justice said, “What solution can be found in this situation?” The secretary said that he would go and conduct a survey himself and submit a report. The chief justice directed them to give salaries to those who met the criteria of the education department. “Ramazan is coming and it is not good not to the pay employees during these days. You should submit your report by Tuesday and those who are eligible should be paid.” The court adjourned the hearing till Tuesday.

The caretaker chief minister stated that Rs935 million was required for the timely construction of four under-construction dams under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) in the province.
The chief minister requested the federal government to provide Rs10 billion for the relief and rehabilitation of flood-affected people; and restore 100 mmcf of gas allocated for power generation.
The chief minister also requested the prime minister to present the issues of payment of net profit of electricity to the province as per the Qazi Committee formula in the next meeting of the Council of Common Interests (CCI).
Earlier, to put an end to the financial crunch faced by the province, the K-P finance department had presented various recommendations to be taken up with the federal government which include, but not limited to; an immediate revision of the share of K-P province in the 7th NFC Award, in the context of the merger of the erstwhile FATA with the province by adding the population of 2017 census to the 7th NFC formula, strict implementation of Article 151 of the constitution by all the federating units so that no unit should take any arbitrary legislative or executive action restricting trade and interprovincial movement of goods especially wheat and immediate rehabilitation of CRBC.
“There would be no compromise on the legitimate rights of the province and every effort would be made to take up the issue with the federal government in order to solve these issues on permanent basis,” the chief minister observed.
