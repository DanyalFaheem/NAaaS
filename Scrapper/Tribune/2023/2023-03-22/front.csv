0,India denies Pakistan entry at SCO meeting,"Event on Armed Forces contribution in military medicine, healthcare and pandemics held in Dehli sans Pak delegation","In an unprecedented move, India denied Pakistan’s participation in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) seminar on armed forces’ contributions to military medicine, healthcare and pandemics, held in New Delhi on Tuesday.
India is currently the president of the SCO and is hosting a series of events. Pakistan was expected to attend the conference of think tanks with the theme “SCO Armed Forces Contribution in Military Medicine, Healthcare and Pandemics” at the official level.
“In doing so, India has misused its position as the current chair and acted irresponsibly in denying a sovereign member State, the right to participate in an SCO event,” according to a source familiar with the development.
According to Indian media reports, New Delhi objected to the map used by the Pakistani side, showing Jammu and Kashmir as its territory. After the matter came to the Indian external affairs ministry’s notice, the Pakistani side was asked to show the “correct map” or to stay away from the seminar.
The Pakistani delegation chose to stay away, reported the India media. Sources in Islamabad said India effectively withdrew invitation.
Pakistan rejected the Indian excuse that it could deny participation of a member state from an SCO event on the basis of flawed understanding about the nature of a disputed territory between Pakistan and India.
“Jammu and Kashmir remains an internationally-recognised disputed territory, whose final disposition is to be made in accordance with the relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions through a fair and impartial plebiscite under the auspices of the United Nations,” according to the source.
In line with its strong commitment to the Shanghai spirit and the charter and objectives of the SCO, Pakistan has been participating with a positive and constructive approach in the various SCO events being held under current chairmanship of India.
Pakistan has urged India not to exploit its SCO chairmanship to advance its self-serving objectives and politicise the organization.
India has invited Pakistan defence and foreign ministers to attend the SCO meetings in April and May. Pakistan has yet to respond to the Indian invitation.

1,Malicious agenda of enemies will be foiled: PM,"Shehbaz inaugurates 1,650 mw coal power projects in Thar","Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Wednesday no one was above the law and would not be allowed to support terrorists and use them as shields, pledging that the malicious agenda of the enemies would be foiled.
Addressing the launching ceremony of the two more coal-powered electricity generation plants in the Islamkot area of Thar, Shehbaz assured that the coalition government would put in all efforts to materialise the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects.
The prime minister, accompanied by the Foreign Minister and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, inaugurated various projects, including a 7.8 million ton mining project, which is a joint venture with a Chinese company.
“In the past there was nothing except the sand dunes in Thar. But today this desert region is producing thousands of megawatt electricity, which is electrifying the whole of Pakistan,” the prime minister told the ceremony.
“With the massive coal deposits in Thar, the country can produce tens of thousands of megawatts of electricity for over 100 years. The Thar’s coal is not only helping Pakistan generate power, but also saving billions of dollars in fuel import,” he said.
Referring to the criticism over delay in laying the transmission lines to connect Thar with the national grid, Shehbaz assured that the project would be completed by April 30, stressing that generating power with transmission lines was useless.
The prime minister directed the federal Power Minister Khurram Dastgir Khan to ensure the timely completion of the transmission line. “It shouldn’t happen that we have power but without the transmission mechanism.”
On the occasion, Foreign Minister Bilawal underlined that the success of the Thar coal project was made possible because of the cooperation between the federal and Sindh governments.
He observed that in the past, the people of Thar used to go to other cities of Pakistan to find work. But now, he added, “the people from all corners of the country can be seen working” in Thar.
Bilawal noted that some conspiracy driven elements continued to spread propaganda against the Thar coal projects and even against the Chinese. However, the biggest answer to such criticism or conspiracy was the success of the coal projects, he believed.
Addressing the ceremony, Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah requested the federal government to provide “the gift of free electricity” to the people of Tharparkar. He said the government was also paying the electricity bills of the consumers in Islamkot who utilise lees than 200 units per month.
The chief minister pointed out that the provincial government, which is 54% partner in the Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company, has dedicated its profits for development and other projects in Thar.
Khurram Dastgir Khan said the government was trying to ensure that the plants operating on imported coal switch to Thar coal. He said the government would support such plants which work according to its energy vision.
The inaugurated plants include 1,320 megawatts (MW) project of Shanghai Electric, which consists of two plants of 660 MW each, and 330 MW Thal Nova. The commissioned projects have been completed at a cost of $3.53 billion.
With the generation of 1,650MW electricity the total generation from Thar coal rises to around 3,300 MW. The five plants, harnessing Thar coal, are believed to be saving around Rs550 billion or $2 billion per annum by cutting the coal import.
In his address, the prime minister congratulated China and the Sindh government and the federal departments concerned for the successful operation of the coal projects in Thar. At the ceremony, The Chinese charge d’affaires, chief executive of Shanghai Electric and other Chinese officials also expressed their views.

2,Parliament’s ruling sought to ‘deal with' PTI,Minister highlights ‘violence perpetrated' by party activists,"Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah on Wednesday sought a parliament ruling to empower authorities to tackle the PTI's alleged involvement in violence.
The ruling was asked for in a joint session of parliament convened over the instability caused by the crisis over PTI chairman and deposed premier Imran Khan.
Speaking in the National Assembly, Sanaullah said nearly 68 security personnel were injured in clashes on March 18.
The clashes erupted after Imran’s activists prevented police and Rangers from arresting him in the Toshakhana case in which he was accused of unlawfully selling state gifts during his tenure as the premier between 2018 and 2022.
Sanaullah added that police vehicles, motorcycles, and public properties were set on fire during the clashes.
He continued that 316 PTI activists had been arrested and would face trial in an anti-terrorism court.
The minister requested the House to give “guidance” to the government about the violence stoked by Imran’s activists and supporters, who he claimed included “miscreants, armed groups, and terrorists”.
“Parliament has the responsibility to guide the nation in various affairs and it would have to play a role now to check the attempts of creating an administrative crisis in the country,” he added.
He continued that parliament should also give directions to overcome the economic crisis.
“It is required that the security forces should be given the authority and other measures to deal with this issue,” he said, adding that the PTI chief’s agenda was “chaos and anarchy”.
The government has alleged that Imran’s activists had militants among them and ministers have called for proscribing the PTI.
Sanaullah highlighted that parliament was the supreme institution.
He added that other institutions had their own domains, responsibilities and authorities as per the Constitution.
He pointed out that parliament could amend the Constitution and increase or decrease the authority of other institutions.
The minister said parliament should discuss the overall situation and provide directions to all institutions on their basic roles.
The minister claimed that Imran had been involved in creating chaos and unrest in the country for the last 10 years.
“[The] sit-in for 126 days; foul language in speeches; disrespect for parliament; and long marches and protests from 2013-18 were aimed at creating anarchy in the country,” he added.
Sanaullah alleged that elections were rigged and managed to bring Imran  into power in 2018.
He claimed that Imran tried to sideline the opposition.
The minister maintained that Imran had rejected the offers of PML-N President (and now prime minister) Shehbaz Sharif and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, also the incumbent foreign minister, for cooperation to steer the country out of the challenges it was facing.
He claimed that Imran had used abusive language against opposition leaders during his term as the prime minister and victimised them.
Sanaullah recalled that the leadership of the PML-N including Shehbaz, Khawaja Asif, Saad Rafique, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and PPP Co-Chairperson Asif Ali Zardari and his sister Faryal Talpur were detained in jail.
He added that Mirza Shahzad Akbar, then premier Imran’s aide, was launched to target the opposition leaders and cases were filed against them.
The minister said the incumbent government had accepted the difficult conditions set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as it was asked to fulfill them first to proceed ahead with the loan programme.
Sanaullah maintained that during the tenure of the PML-N government between 2013 and 2018, the country was on the way to progress, terrorism had come to an end and the GDP growth remained around 6.2%.
Later, he added that a “propagandist”, in a reference to Imran, was brought into power with a thin majority.
He continued that the propagandist was later ousted in a constitutional manner.
The minister claimed Imran had spread propaganda about the US cipher and tried to destabilise the constitutional government through protest calls on May 25 as well as November 26 when an important appointment was about to be announced.
He added that the Wazirabad attack – in which Imran suffered bullet wounds to his foot -- was also exploited and allegations were levelled against political opponents.
Sanaullah maintained that the people had rejected Imran’s politics, which stood exposed in his long march which culminated in Rawalpindi.
After this “defeat” on the political front, the minister said a “frustrated” Imran then announced the dissolution of assemblies in two provinces.
Sanaullah noted that the Constitution made it mandatory to holding elections in 90 days but it also asked for free and fair polls.
He said elections had been announced in Punjab on April 30, but this date was not as per the constitutional deadline of 90 days.
The minister also questioned the transparency of elections if held in phases.
He continued that allegations would be levelled if the polls for National Assembly seats were held in two provinces in the presence of elected governments.
Sanaullah maintained Imran had no answers in the cases against him including Toshakahana, prohibited funding and Tyrian White ones.
About the remarks of Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial about the elections, the minister said the top judge's directions were already being followed and the PML-N's preparations were underway to participate in the provincial polls.
Sanaullah demanded that a reference should be fixed against a sitting judge of the apex court for hearing in the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC).
He added that a reference had been filed against that judge by the Pakistan Bar Council.
The minister also condemned the remarks of former CJP Saqib Nisar against a female political leader in a leaked audio.
He said that charges of embezzlement against the judiciary should be investigated as two sons of a sitting judge allegedly remained involved in managing cases.

3,ECP about-face,"In surprise move, electoral supervisor delays Punjab polls until Oct 8","In a surprising development, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Wednesday delayed the election in Punjab until October 8 on the grounds that it could not conduct transparent and peaceful polls on the scheduled date of April 30.
In an eight-page order, the ECP said that it could not hold the election “honestly, justly and fairly in a peaceful manner due to security threats [and] in the absence of funds” and being unable to provide “level-playing field” to all political parties.
It said that the elections could not be held in Punjab under the circumstances conveyed to it by the law-enforcement agencies, finance, defence and interior ministries, Punjab chief secretary and others, who all opposed the polls on various grounds.
Subsequently, the ECP withdrew its notification regarding the elections in Punjab and postponed the voting for the provincial assembly until October 8, 2023, adding that fresh election schedule would be announced in due course.
“The Commission hereby withdraws the election programme issued vide Notification No. F. 2(3)/2023/Cord dated 8th March, 2023 and fresh schedule will be issued in due course of time with poll date on 08th October, 2023,” the ECP order stated.
After considering reports of different stakeholders, such as the interior and the defence ministries, the ECP said, it reached the conclusion that “it is not possible to hold and organise elections … in accordance with the Constitution and law”.
Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja and the ECP members, Shah Muhammad Jatoi, Nisar Ahmed Durrani, Babar Hassan Bharwana and Justice (retd) Ikramullah Khan, while referring to the briefings given by the officials concerned noted that 252 incidents of terrorism had taken place since January 2023 and they were intensifying with each passing day, particularly the cross-border incursion.
The ECP order comes at a time when it has increasingly become clear that the polls in Punjab may not take place on the stipulated date, while the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) governor has yet to give the timeframe for the assembly polls due in the province.
Surprising as it may seem, when all eyes were on the joint session of parliament and a meeting of the federal cabinet on Wednesday, the ECP released its order, carrying its decision of delaying the elections in Punjab.
In the federal cabinet meeting, the ministers opined that general elections should be held simultaneously across the country as neither holding polls in two provinces only was possible nor security and monetary situation favoured them.
Sources said that the cabinet decided that it would convey its response to the ECP after considering all aspects of the situation.
Earlier this month, the Supreme Court ordered that President Arif Alvi should announce the date of the Punjab Assembly election, while the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) governor would set the election date for the K-P assembly in consultation with the ECP.
A five-judge larger bench of the apex court on March 1 gave a 3-2 split verdict on a suo motu case about the election date for the two provincial assemblies after holding hearing for two days.
The Punjab Assembly was dissolved by then chief minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi in January on the instructions of PTI Chairman Imran Khan. Imran had also ordered the dissolution of the K-P Assembly, which was also dissolved in the same month.
The PTI chief has been holding rallies and protests in different cities to force the federal government for calling early election in the country. The dissolution of the Punjab and K-P assemblies was also part of his efforts for early elections.
The federal government has been opposing the early elections. It says that elections should be held on the same day once the incumbent government completes it constitutional term.
The government side argues that holding elections separately would increase political crisis. Both the sides, however, admit that the deadlock has led to political instability and deteriorated economic situation.

4,Parliament to hold high-stakes session,Lawmakers meet today to forge consensus on eight critical issues and chart a path forward,"The parliament is all set to discuss eight key issues being faced by the country as well as take important decisions to enforce the state’s writ in connection with an ongoing anti-government campaign by former premier Imran Khan’s party when the country is battling to avert default and elections are just around the corner.
The precarious security situation is on top of the agenda. Though the word election is missing from the agenda issued for the joint sitting of parliament, the upcoming elections in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and the question whether the country should go for polls in the two provinces first or opt for general elections across the country is expected to dominate the debate.
The government decided to summon the joint sitting of parliament after the ruling PML-N and its allied parties met at the Prime Minister House on March 20 to deliberate on the ongoing political and economic situation in the midst of prolonged anti-government defiance by Imran Khan and his party.
In the six-hour long huddle on Monday, the ruling coalition vowed to get tough on the PTI, claiming that the former ruling party had become a terrorist outfit over its involvement in attacking the state institutions, including the army, judiciary, and law-enforcement agencies.
It not only condemned the attacks carried out on the police and Rangers allegedly on the orders of the PTI chairman, when they went to Imran's Zaman Park residence in Lahore and when Imran came with his supporters to a court in Islamabad the other day, but announced that the joint session of parliament on March 22 (today) would take important decisions to ensure the writ of the state. The joint session will begin at 4pm.
According to the agenda, the joint sitting of the parliament will take up eight key issues: law and order and terrorism; economic policy; Jammu and Kashmir issue; respect for national institutions; China-Pakistan Economic Corridor; population explosion; climate change impacts; and foreign policy.
The agenda states that the parliamentarians will discuss the national issues in order to create awareness and build consensus on the eight major issues.
Amid alarming rise in terrorism, the parliamentarians are likely to discuss the mistakes committed in the recent past and give a way forward on how to equip law enforcers with modern equipment to counter the threats.
They would also take up the issue of smear campaigns run against the institutions every now and then.
The parliament would also examine the causes of delay in CPEC projects, especially, during the PTI rule.
In addition, it would contemplate on the Kashmir issue since India stripped the valley of its special status.
The devastating floods and havoc caused by them across the country would also be discussed in detail.
Apart from the domestic political environment, the joint sitting would envisage where the country’s interests converge amid the changing geopolitical environment.
Though elections and national census is not listed as the agenda items, it is expected that the House would deliberate on legal and constitutional hindrances if the elections are separately held in the country.
The PTI chief has been demanding snap polls and holding rallies and protests in different cities to force elections on the federal government since his ouster through a vote of no-confidence in April last year.
He had even dissolved the Punjab and K-P assemblies for the purpose.
In response, the government has been opposing the demand and the authorities concerned have booked Imran and PTI leadership in dozens of cases.
Also, the ruling coalition is trying to build consensus that elections should be held simultaneously once the incumbent government completes the constitutional term.
The deadlock has led to political instability and deteriorated economic situation.
Terrorism has reared its ugly head again as the country recently saw a surge in violent attacks.
To add insult to injury, neither the International Monetary Fund (IMF) nor any friendly country or any other state has so far provided cash-strapped Pakistan with funds.
Inflation has broken several decades’ record, petroleum products are at the highest level, currency devaluation is at its peak and, amid all this, the country’s political leadership has failed to develop consensus on key issues, including the date for the general elections.
Recently, the Supreme Court ruled that elections must be held in Punjab and K-P within 90 days of their dissolution.
The ECP has already fixed April 30 as the date for polls in Punjab but the federal government as well as Sindh and Balochistan governments have expressed their concern over the holding of polls in only two provinces.
They demanded that elections in all the provinces and Centre be held at the same time.
The government has been arguing that if elections in Punjab are held now, the new provincial government will have influence on polls to the National Assembly.
The ruling coalition is expected to pass several resolutions in the session.

5,Pakistan averts default on payments to Kuwait,ECC approves Rs27b to foot bill for Gulf state’s diesel," 
Pakistan on Tuesday approved a supplementary grant of Rs27 billion to avert a looming default on account of diesel purchase payments to Kuwait --- a move that might create problems in other areas because of the country's efforts to keep the overall expenses within the limits agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet, which approved the supplementary grant to settle the diesel payments, also sanctioned another Rs2.9 billion to partly offset the wheat shortage in the Gilgit-Baltistan region.
The two decisions by the cabinet body show the extreme economic difficulties that the government is facing in avoiding a default in one area but ending up creating troubles in others.
Sources in the finance ministry said there were verbal instructions to the accountant general of Pakistan revenue (AGPR) to delay the clearance of some non-salary bills for a few weeks to create fiscal space.
A finance ministry handout read that the Petroleum Division had submitted to the ECC a summary on the credit facility extended by the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) against the supply of diesel under a contract with the Pakistan State Oil (PSO) since 2000.
It added that the term contract was extended every year and the agreement had already lapsed in December.
The Petroleum Division informed the ECC that four payments were still  pending.
The finance ministry stated that the PSO deposited the rupee equivalent with the National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) after 30 days from the date of the bill of lading of each shipment.
The NBP then transferred the cargo cost to the KPC in Kuwait.
“In the current situation, this account has witnessed huge exchange losses due to upheaval in the rupee-dollar parity during the last 12 months,” the finance ministry’s statement read.
“Considering the above situation, the ECC approved an immediate technical supplementary grant of Rs27 billion for [the] Kuwait Petroleum Company,” it added.
Under a deal with the IMF, Pakistan is committed to either slash expenditures equal to a supplementary grant or levy additional taxes of the same amount.
In December, the ECC had avoided taking the responsibility and did not clear requests for Rs17 billion in supplementary grants.
The ECC had set up a committee to give recommendations to settle the claims against foreign exchange losses being faced because of the KPC credit facility, FE-25 loan scheme and Islamic Trade Finance Corporation (ITFC) lending being availed by the PSO for import financing purposes.
However, the committee has not yet finalised its recommendations.
The ECC was informed that an international default situation was “developing” and the available funds were short beyond March 20, 2023.
According to Petroleum Division sources, the NBP account had a balance of Rs14.3 billion against the payments of Rs42 billion,.
“There is [a] definite possibility of [an] international default unless an injection of Rs27 billion is made before 20th March 2023,” according to the Petroleum Division correspondence.
Despite extreme difficulties, the government has decided to give a subsidy of Rs50 per litre to up to 800cc car owners, motorcyclists and rickshaws.
According to the minister of state for petroleum, they account for more than 51% of the total consumption.
This may cause wastage besides creating additional demand for petrol imports amid a scarcity of foreign exchange.
Wheat subsidy
The ECC considered a summary on wheat supply to Gilgit-Baltistan and approved an immediate release of 25,000 metric tons of wheat to the region for the months of March and April this year.
According to the finance ministry, the reason behind the move was to avoid shortage of wheat in G-B, especially during the holy month of Ramazan.
It added that keeping in view the current wheat price, the ECC granted an additional amount of Rs2.9 billion to meet the urgent requirements of G-B.
The ECC further directed the  Kashmir affairs and G-B ministry to submit a comprehensive plan for price rationalisation in consultation with the stakeholders for the consideration of the cabinet body within 30 days.
The wheat flour sale price in G-B is just Rs12.5 per kg against more than Rs140 across the country.
However, wheat and flour were not available to the people of the region on subsidised rates because of a number of governance issues, the ECC was informed.
The federal government provides 160,000 metric tons of wheat annually to G-B.
During the current fiscal year, an amount of Rs8 billion was allocated for wheat procurement for G-B that have been fully utilised with around 90,000 metric ton supplies.
This was because of the increased cost of the imported wheat and enhanced transportation charges, the ECC was informed.
The regional government was of the view that supplies had been held up and wheat prices in the grey market of the G-B region had increased substantially.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had directed to immediately release 26,666 metric tons of wheat for the months of March and April this year along with an allocation of Rs2.5 billion to meet the urgent requirements of G-B.
However, the ECC approved 1,660 metric tons less than what the premier wanted.
Still, there will be a shortage of 45,000 metric tons of wheat during the current fiscal year.
The G-B government is considering to withdraw the general subsidy.
It is planning to give only targeted subsidy because of the shortage of funds and abnormally low wheat flour price of just Rs12.5 per kg.
