2,CDA allowed to dump waste at Losar in violation of court order,Locals to file contempt plea against Rawalpindi deputy commissioner,"The Rawalpindi administration has allocated 1200-kanal of land to the Capital Development Authority (CDA) in Mauza Losar to dump the capital’s waste in violation of the court order.
Rawalpindi Deputy Commissioner Hasan Waqar Cheema through a notification has given formal permission to the CDA to dump all garbage and harmful hospital waste from Islamabad at the Losar, dumping site.
The Lahore High Court Rawalpindi bench had ordered to remove the dumping site, where waste from Rawalpindi is already being dumped, to Mandra–Chakwal Road, where the Rawalpindi administration had acquired 1,200-kanal of land.
Instead of moving the waste dumping site to Mandra–Chakwal Road, the Rawalpindi administration has not only allowed the CDA to dispose of waste at Losar but also decided to dump the waste of the garrison city at the same location.
The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government had approved to remove the dumping ground spreading on 1,250-kanal at Losar and move it to Mandra–Chakwal Road. However, the current Rawalpindi administration decided against the order of the high court and allowed the CDA to dump the capital’s waste at the current dumping site.
After the local administration allowed the CDA to dump the waste at Losar, around 120,000 residents of the area announced to file a contempt plea in the high court against the Rawalpindi deputy commissioner.
They announced to challenge the deputy commissioner’s notification allowing the CDA to dump the capita’s waste. Thoba, Bada Meera, Chhota Meera, Hari, Bhambli Meera and other villages are also located in the area.
Due to the dumping of garbage at Losar, citizens were already suffering from cancer, skin diseases, tuberculosis, and throat, stomach, and eye irritation.
They said that the dumping of the capital’s waste will further exacerbate ailments and put the locals at higher risk of catching diseases.
The construction of the new dumping ground for Islamabad will also lead to the shutting down of 15 brick kilns in Losar and nearby villages. Zigzag technology had been installed in these brick kilns at a cost of millions of rupees a year ago. The closure of these brick kilns will increase the prices of bricks and render thousands of workers jobless.
Mohammad Asif advocate and Imran Aziz said that on their petition, the high court had decided to remove the dumping ground from Losar and shift it to Mandra Road. They said that Islamabad is a separate district, so how can the garbage of the federal capital be dumped in Punjab?
They said that the deputy commissioner has illegally allowed the garbage of Islamabad to be dumped in Rawalpindi. They said that they have decided to challenge the decision in the high court.

The conference aimed to explore and identify innovative ways to engage these groups to address the challenges posed by the floods, and devise a plan for sustainable and long-term solutions.
During the event, MoU was signed between the Coca-Cola Company and USAID to create a humanitarian and social development impact in Pakistan by addressing the immediate, short, and long-term needs of the flood-affected population and social development causes in Pakistan.
Under the MoU, USAID will collaborate with the company on flood response activities and use its convening power to create an enabling environment to address operational challenges. Additionally, USAID will facilitate contacts through its network of relationships with the local business and diaspora of Pakistani nationals abroad for identifying possible partnership opportunities.
The company, in turn, will collaborate with USAID in flood-affected areas following a hybrid approach of creating a social and commercial impact.

5,Major water project still on the backburner,WHO ranks Pakistan 23rd among water-starved nations,"On the occasion of World Water Day keeping in view Pakistan ranking 23rd among the countries suffering from severe water shortage in the next decade and its fast-depleting water reserves, it has become inevitable to adopt austerity at the national level.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has also declared the availability of water in accordance with the principles of hygiene and securing water reserves as extremely significant because every year more than five million people in the world suffer from diseases due to the use of contaminated water.
Given the rapid decline of the underground water levels in Pakistan and the increase in the need for water due to its growing population, it has become extremely necessary to protect the reservoirs, but also to use the seawater as well as the water from the rivers, which gets wasted by falling into the sea, for drinking after treatment.
Further, rainwater harvesting can be used for proper and economical use of water for bathing, and ablution in mosques and the same water can also be used for irrigation purposes.
Currently, water is being used through the wash basin to commode link in an awareness campaign for the correct and economical use of water in Japan, through which the water used in the wash basin can be reused in the commode.
In this regard, it is also important not to have leakages in the water supply network, not to overflow the overhead tank and to shut down the electric motor after running it to obtain water so that the electric motor does not keep running more than the requirement and the waste of electricity and water due to overflowing can be avoided.
On the occasion of World Water Day on March 22 [today], the WHO is convincing citizens and governments to use water carefully and economically.
In this context, it is very important to use underground water with a plan and to use sea and river water after treatment for drinking and other needs. The WHO has indicated that Pakistan is in 23rd place among those countries which will have a severe shortage of water in the next decade.
According to the WHO, the countries in which there is a severe shortage of water include Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Arab Emirates, Palestine, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Oman, Kyrgyzstan and Iran.
In the awareness campaign regarding the lack of water reservoirs in these countries, citizens and responsible institutions are being convinced about the economical use of water, its importance and utility and preventing wastage.
Like any other country, if the water situation is examined in the country’s capital, where the central offices of the federal government and all related institutions are located, there is no long-term plan for water availability in Islamabad its twin city of Rawalpindi despite the increasing need for water among the growing population.
At present, apart from Rawal Dam and Khanpur Dam, which depend on rainwater, water supply through tube wells is feasible while the most important water supply project for Islamabad and Rawalpindi districts for over 100 years, the Ghazi Barotha Water Supply Project is still pending after being considered by many governments in the past.
The cost of the Ghazi Barotha project, which has suffered the longest delay, has now reached Rs90 billion. Its project concept-1 (PC-1) has been sent to the Central Development Working Party (CDWP) by the Capital Development Authority (CDA), the executing agency of the project.
In the first phase of the project, 200 million gallons of water will be available per day of which 100 million gallons per day (MGD) of water is to be provided to the CDA, 50 MGD to the WASA and 50 MGD to the Rawalpindi Cantonment Board.
The cost of the project has been divided among the three institutions according to their water supply share, under which the CDA will be responsible to pay Rs45 billion and the WASA and RCB will pay Rs22.50 billion each. In the second and third phases of the project, the daily supply is to reach 300 million gallons per day, but the project is still pending.
