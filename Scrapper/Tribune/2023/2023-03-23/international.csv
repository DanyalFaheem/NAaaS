2,Arts Council organises ‘Jashan-e-Nowruz’,'The spirit of Nowruz is not just wearing new clothes but also burying grudges and forgiving estranged relatives',"A Jashan-e-Nowruz was organised at the Arts Council of Pakistan on Wednesday which was attended by Dr Saeed Talebi Nia, Director General of Iranian culture centre Khana Farhang, and others. 
During the Jashan, noted poets recited poems while Sameer Humza of the ACP Music Academy sang the late revolutionary poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz's poem “Tum mere pass raho.”
While speaking on the occasion, Dr Saeed said, “I congratulate all people on Nowruz. May the New Year be a year of success for all of you. The festival of Nowruz is celebrated not only in Iran but also in Turkestan.” 
He added that apart from Iran, Azerbaijan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India, Nowruz is also celebrated with much fanfare in many countries of the world. The spirit of Nowruz is not just wearing new clothes but also burying grudges and forgiving estranged relatives and friends and celebrating this festival collectively, Dr Saeed said. 
Farast Rizvi said it is a 3,000-year-old festival from the Vedic era as it has been celebrated since the time of King Jamshed of ancient Persia. “It has been a symbol of knowledge. As all festivals in other cultures are related to the spring, Nowruz is also associated with this season of rebirth,” he added.

3,Another religious scholar killed in targeted attack,Maulana Salim Khatri of Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat was shot five times by two gunmen,"Another religious scholar, Maulana Salim Khatri of Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat (AWJ), was gunned down in the metropolitan city on Wednesday, a day after Maulana Abdul Qayyum Sufi Naqshbandi of the Sunni Ulema Council was killed in a targeted attack.
Four gunmen riding on two motorcycles shot and killed Maulana Khatri in Sector 5-E of New Karachi in the remits of Bilal Colony police station, according to police and witnesses. The 58-year-old cleric was sitting at a pan-shop at 3pm near his house when he was targeted. 
Acting SP for New Karachi Kunwar Asif told the media that Maulana Khatri was pronounced dead on arrival at the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital where he was shifted after the shooting. He was shot five times, while police have found seven empties of 9mm pistols at the crime scene, SP Asif said. “We are obtaining footage from the CCTV cameras installed in the area,” he added.
Bilal Colony police station SHO Aftab Abbasi confirmed that the assailants were four in number but only two of them opened fire on Maulana Khatri. He added that the incident appeared to be a targeted attack.
Footage from one CCTV camera that has been shared on social media shows two men, who are believed to be attackers, running out of the area. Witnesses say that the attackers crossed the road where two motorcycles with their riders were waiting for them.
A large number of ASWJ leaders and workers arrived at the hospital after the news of the attack broke. They said “anti-state elements” were ruining Karachi's peace while the rulers were unable to maintain law and order. ASWJ's General Secretary Taj Muhammad Hanfi said that the funeral of the slain leader would be held at 10pm.
Meanwhile, protesters blocked the highway near the Edhi morgue in Sohrab Goth where Maulana Khatri's body was taken from the hospital after medico-legal formalities. The protest, which disrupted the traffic flow for some time, was ended after police assured the protesters that those responsible would be brought to justice. 
The targeted shooting came a day after Maulana Abdul Qayyum Sufi Naqshbandi of the Sunni Ulema Council was shot dead while walking back home from mosque after Fajr prayers in Gulistan-e-Jauhar. 
Mufti Muneebur Rehman, while speaking at Maulana Sufi's funeral, said that the “construction mafia” could be possibly involved in the murder.

4,Squatters foil anti-encroachment drive again,Officials say they will return with adequately planned operation,"After several attempts, another operation was foiled when a mob of agitated protestors forced Karachi Development Authority (KDA) personnel away from Gulistan-e-Jauhar Block 10 and 11, where they arrived to clear the encroachment on Wednesday. 
The encroachers not only threw stones at them but also burnt tyres to block the road, pushing the officials away. Subsequently, the anti-encroachment team again failed to implement the court orders. 
KDA officials, while talking to The Express Tribune, said a mafia is occupying the area who are using women and children as a shield, which is why they backed off today. 
However, they said the court orders to evict the squatters would be implemented in any case, adding that they would be back to remove the encroachment with an adequately planned operation.

5,"Organised gangs involved in selling KDA land, SHC told",Court orders KDA to seek help from Rangers and police to retrieve land from squatters in Surjani Town,"Organised criminal gangs are illegally selling lands belonging to the Karachi Development Authority (KDA) in Surjani Town Block 8, the Sindh High Court (SHC) was informed during the hearing of a petition regarding alleged land grabbing in the town.
The KDA officials, through their counsel, submitted a report stating that plots are being sold in the name of fake societies under different names. Advertisements have been published in national newspapers regarding the illegal sale of lands, the report further states. The operation to evict squatters from encroached KDA land could not be completed due to a lack of manpower and resources.
The court ordered removal of encroachments and illegal constructions and submission of a compliance report on March 30. The court also ordered that help should be sought from the Rangers and police for retrieval of KDA land from squatters.
Meanwhile, a two-judge SHC bench on Wednesday accepted a request for urgent hearing of a petition regarding non-implementation of a ban order on carcinogenic tobacco chew, such as gutka and main puri, by police, and issued notices to the Sindh chief secretary, home secretary, IGP Sindh and additional IGP Karachi.
Appearing before the bench, headed by Justice Muhammad Iqbal Kalhoro, the petitioner's lawyer Muzzammil Mumtaz Meo Advocate stated that the provincial police, including IGP, were not implementing the court ban orders on gutka and main puri. Two officers in the SSP Malir office, namely Moin and Asghar, are patronising the gutka mafia, as per the petitioner. Despite a ban, the sale of gutka and main puri continues. 
According to a report by the doctors at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, the number of mouth cancer patients has gone up. People from the poor class are falling victim to different diseases due to the use of gutka and main puri. 
The petitioner claimed that the SHOs of police stations were involved in the sale of gutka and main puri. Only in Malir district, 30 to 35 gutka and main puri factories are being operated. The SHOs are receiving Rs3 million per week from these factories. The head muharrir of every police station receives Rs35,000 per month from each cabin selling gutka and main puri. 
The petitioner sought a court direction to the provincial police chief to take action against these policemen. The court accepted the request for an urgent hearing of the application and issued notices to the chief secretary, home secretary, IG Sindh and AIG Karachi.
M9 corruption scam
The Sindh High Court (SHC) has nullified a banking court decision on the bail petition of Mukhtiar Ali Chandio, manager of a bank in Naushahro Feroze, and Saud ul Haq in alleged Rs3 billion embezzlement in acquisition of land for the Hyderabad Sukkur Motorway, M9, while ordering the trial court to decide the petition within 10 days.
Appearing before a two-member SHC bench, headed by Justice Muhammad Iqbal Kalhoro, on Wednesday, public prosecutor GM Bhutto stated that government officials and private individuals were involved in the M9 corruption scandal. Four suspects, including a former deputy commissioner of Naushahro Feroze, have fled the country. “The scam, which involves Rs.3.4 billion, is huge and hence should be transferred to NAB,” he further stated.
Justice Kalhoro observed that the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) was mainly involved in all such inquiries these days. “Laws should be implemented to catch culprits in the white-collar crimes,” he observed while regretting that in major cases, even challan was not presented for four to five months.
The court asked the public prosecutor to implement the law or change it.

8,Public university in Lyari on verge of closure,"After the institute’s former VC was sent on leave, no efforts have been made to replace him","While the state of educational institutions in the entire country is nothing to boast about, one institution in Sindh can be singled out for being so miserably run that it is on the brink of closing down for good. 
The Benazir Bhutto Shaheed University Lyari, has been functioning without a permanent Vice Chancellor (VC) for the past year and is presently being looked after by ad hoc appointments, which seemingly have no interest in running the daily affairs of the institute. Furthermore, the university neither has a permanent Registrar nor does it have a Director Finance. 
It is pertinent to mention that the university got to the brink of closure it is at right now after its VC, Professor Dr Akhtar Baloch, was sent on leave in February of 2022 due to allegations of misconduct with a female Member of Provincial Assembly (MPA). Allegedly Dr Baloch had sent a provocative emoji to the MPA and the case was referred to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA). However, even though the FIA’s inquiry did not prove the allegation against the VC, the Secretary of Universities and Boards Department, Mureed Rahimoon, saw it fit to remove Dr Baloch, and sent a summary in this regard to the Chief Minister. 
When asked about the inordinate delay in deciding the VC’s fate, Rahimoon replied: “The summary has been sent to the Chief Minister and he will decide on the matter soon.”
While it remains to be seen how soon the Chief Minister decides Dr Baloch’s fate, the ad hoc system that is running the institute has failed miserably, as per sources privy to the information. The Express Tribune learnt that there is no Dean for any of the 9 departments of the university; there are only 4 associate professors working; and a whopping 60 per cent of the academic load has gone to part-time teachers or visiting faculty. Moreover, the institute’s finances are also in poor shape, as it recently had to pay salaries through its reserve funds. 
Interim VC of the Benazir Bhutto Shaheed University Lyari, Dr Amjad Siraj Memon, who is the permanent VC of Jinnah Sindh Medical University, when asked about the university being in disarray, conceded that the institute had seen better days. “The financial situation is dire evidenced by the budget deficit as we have to pay different allowances on top of the salaries to the teachers,” informed Dr Memon, adding that a cut in allowances meant that teachers would start protesting. “The university is marred by multiple issues, one of which is my life constantly being threatened by the gangs in Lyari. Another is the lack of funds to hire new teachers,” regretted Dr Memon while talking to The Express Tribune.
