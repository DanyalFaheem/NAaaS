0,'US weaponising human rights against China',"Scholars, journalists, leaders from across the world reject US democracy summit; laud China 'whole-process democracy'","Seasoned politician Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed on Wednesday said China has become the centre of the world as the economic and political balance shifts from the West to the East while noting that Beijing’s vision of harmony and win-win cooperation was winning the day against the narrative that sought to sow seeds of conflict.
Quoting from Chinese President Xi Jinping’s recent statement, he observed that the world was undergoing ‘once-in-a-century’ changes as the three-hundred western hegemony was coming to an end.
He made the remarks at the second “International Forum on Democracy: The Shared Human Values” held in Beijing ahead of the US' ""Summit for Democracy”. The forum was attended by 300 guests from more than 100 countries and regions who engaged in extensive discussions on diverse forms of democracy, slamming hegemonic narratives on the subject.
“Today, we have seen two contrasting views on globalization on how to get humanity forward. One, represented by China, talks about cooperation and connectivity among different civilizations, and the other comes from the West, especially the US, and stresses conflicts, clash of civilizations and confrontation,” he said at the forum.
He believed that the Biden administration’s next week's Summit for Democracy was a “so-called democracy summit” as it was all about “weaponizing human rights against the emerging World War against China and Russia”.
Some countries are looking at the world with a zero-sum game mindset or cold-war mentality, an idea that will be rejected by countries from the Global South and most of the Global North, he added.
The senator went on to recall that in 2021, Pakistan had refused to participate in a two-day virtual US democracy summit as the administration in Washington tried to bring together a select group of countries to join the online gathering.
Three-D approach against China
The PML-N senator opined that the US deployed a “three-D” approach against China, namely: Demonising the country, spreading disinformation against it and thirdly, breeding grounds for its destabilisation.
He pointed out that the rampant onslaught of fake news consistently perpetuated by the western narrative was drowning out the facts about China, particularly the so-called “debt trap” diplomacy.
Citing a Harvard survey that showed that over 90% of Chinese people were satisfied with their government, he regretted that none of this would be reported by the mainstream media. “In the battle of narratives, we promote the truth. And reject the diktats of those who view the world from a zero-sum lens,” he asserted.
Praising the Chinese ‘whole-process democracy’, Syed stressed that it was essential for any democracy to deliver to the people who are the real owners of the system. He said that China was able to lift 800 million people out of poverty within the span of 40 years, adding that this was the benefit of the democratic process.
“During the ceremony marking the founding of the People's Republic on Tiananmen Square on October 1, 1949, Chairman Mao Zedong people had said that the Chinese people have stood up and that they are the masters of their destiny… This encapsulates the essence of democracy. It cannot be dictated by a handful of people,” he added.
""We have seen how China has progressed. We see major examples that we can learn from China in democratic development and building a peaceful and prosperous future. First, this has to be the essence of democracy that people decide their own future. Second, democracy must deliver to the people,"" the senator further said.
Later, speaking to The Express Tribune on the sidelines of the forum, the senator said that the balance of economic and political power was shifting from the West to the East, noting that “the dawn of the Asian century” was a matter of pride for Pakistan.

2,"QESCO’s circular debt hits Rs550b, Senate panel told",Power company’s CEO says Rs5b being added to this amount every month,"The circular debt of the Quetta Electric Supply Company (Qesco) has reached Rs550 billion, with Rs5 billion being added to it every month, its chief executive officer on Wednesday told a Senate panel.
The meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Power, presided over by its chairman Senator Saifullah Abro, was further informed by Qesco officials that they were providing electricity for six hours for tube-wells within their jurisdiction.
Senator Prince Omar Ahmadzai, a member of the committee, pointed out that the provision of electricity to farmers for only six hours was inexcusable.
He added that the farmers also needed electricity for the remaining 18 hours of the day.
The chairman of the panel inquired why Qesco was unable to recover its dues.
Its CEO complained that the Balochistan government was not assisting Qesco for this purpose.
The officials of the Power Division asked him why Qesco had not formed a committee on this matter yet.
The chairman of the committee intervened that Qesco could not be held entirely responsible for the issue.
He questioned what role the Power Division was playing to address this matter.
Abro maintained that the officials wanted to destroy the country and considered the government’s money to be that of the enemy.
Earlier this month, the Balochistan Growers Action Committee (GAC) had blocked all highways across the province against unscheduled power outages.
Intra-district transport remained suspended because of the protests, creating problems for commuters.
Syed Abdul Qahar Agha, the central leader of the GAC claimed that Qesco had been deliberately resorting to a 20-hour power outage across Balochistan on a daily basis.
He said unannounced and prolonged power cuts had severely damaged the standing crops and fruit orchards across the province.
The committee was also given a briefing by the additional secretary (power) on the recent countrywide electricity shutdown.
The Power Division officials told the committee that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had formed a body to ascertain the reasons behind the breakdown.
They added that a report prepared by that body was also presented to the cabinet.
The officials further said after the body was formed by the premier, no further committee was constituted to investigate the power breakdown.
The Senate committee had instructed the Power Division to conduct a departmental inquiry into the shutdown.

5,"Dar ‘sabotaged’ deal with IMF, claims Miftah",Former finance minister says the international money lender lacks ‘interest’ in giving money to Pakistan,"Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Miftah Ismail has blamed Finance Minister Ishaq Dar to have “sabotaged” the deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Former finance minister Miftah Ismail made these remarks in a session titled 'Pakistan in the midst of crisis' in Karachi on Wednesday.
Raising alarm over the long-due continuation of the deal with the international money lender, Miftah claimed: “IMF lacks ‘interest’ in giving money to cash-strapped Pakistan.”
Recalling his dealing with the lender while he was heading the country’s finances, Miftah claimed to have persuaded the IMF to trust the country on fulfilling commitments until Dar was sworn in – indicating that the current finance minister did harm to the good terms with the financial institution.
He recalled that Pakistan has gone back on commitments three times.
'Petrol subsidy formula ineffective'
Reflecting on the petrol subsidy announced by the government on Sunday, Miftah said that he believed that formula would not be effective.
“We provide subsidies on petrol by taking loans,” he said.
Since the government announced the petroleum subsidy — which initially amounted to Rs50 per litre amount and was later increased to Rs100 per litre — several red flags were raised as analysts and economic experts have been criticising the move as it may jeopardise the ongoing struggle to convince the IMF board.
IMF’s resident representative for Pakistan Esther Perez Ruiz had also clarified that said the international money lender wasn’t consulted on the government’s plan to raise fuel prices for wealthier motorists to finance a subsidy for lower-income people.
“Fund staff is seeking greater details on the scheme in terms of its operation, cost, targeting, protections against fraud and abuse, and offsetting measures, and will carefully discuss these elements with the authorities,” she said.
This is not the first time petrol price subsidies have been a sticking point for the IMF. The previous government led by former premier Imran Khan had given out petrol subsidies, which stalled the IMF programme last year.
Warning of the risks, Miftah mentioned that if Pakistan defaults, it would be a grave situation for the country as people belonging to the rich segment will bear the brunt but the poor people won’t be able to make ends meet.

7,Prohibited funding: PTI’s plea to grill witnesses snubbed,ECP decides to proceed with show-cause notice issued to party,"Rejecting the PTI’s application demanding the cross-examination of key witnesses, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Wednesday decided to move ahead with the show-cause notice issued to the party in the prohibited funding case.
The objections raised by the PTI against Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja’s show-cause notice were also dismissed.
A three-member bench, headed by the CEC, heard the case and announced the verdict it had reserved on December 20.
The commission passed the judgment on August 2 last year, documenting financial fraud and over $7 million of illegal funding.
It issued a show-cause notice to the PTI in the same month to justify why further legal action should not be taken against it for gross financial irregularities.
Instead of responding to the show-cause notice, the PTI had filed a new application seeking cross-examination of key witnesses including the scrutiny committee and bank officers.
However, the commission dismissed the party’s application.
During the hearing, the CEC asked about the progress of the case in the Islamabad High Court.
PTI lawyer Nadeem Amjad replied that the IHC had directed the commission to hear the parties.
The CEC observed that the commission had not been stopped from taking action, adding that the PTI’s prohibited funding case should be taken forward.
He pointed out that on August 23, the PTI had sought six weeks’ time for its arguments.
Raja noted that the party had sought time to acquire records from abroad.
He added that over six months had passed now.
The PTI’s lawyer filed a plea to put off the hearing of the case for two weeks.
However, the CEC refused to accept the plea, observing that time could not be given now.
The ECP adjourned the hearing of the case until March 28.
On August 2 last year, the ECP had announced its ruling in the long-awaited, cliffhanger case of the PTI's prohibited funding.
It ruled that the party did indeed receive illegal funding while issuing a notice to the party asking why the funds should not be confiscated.
A three-member ECP bench, headed by the CEC, announced the verdict in a case filed by PTI founding member Akbar S Babar that had been pending since November 14, 2014.
In its written order, the ECP said the political party received millions of dollars in illegal funds from foreign countries, including the US, UK, UAE, and Australia.
However, the party challenged the commission’s verdict in the IHC a few days later, seeking it to be declared “illegal”.
