0,Police to tighten crime record system,Decision taken based on reports of fake CNICs entries of POs,"The Punjab Police has decided to enhance the record management system of arrested suspects, specially hardened and underage criminals, following reports of fake computerised National Identity Cards (CNICs) being used by proclaimed offenders.
The decision was taken based on reports of entry of fake computerised National identity cards (CNIC), especially of proclaimed offenders.
The hardened criminals and history sheeters would usually hide their CNIC from police and resisted sharing it. The police officers, usually showing laxity, would not go the extra mile to fetch their identity. Police would face trouble in dealing with underage suspects.
DIG Information and Technology (DIG IT) Ahsan Younis has asked field officers to take special measures in this regard and has shared the improved Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) with them.
Younis on behalf of IG Punjab had asked the field officers to reform the suspects' arrest entry registration system. The police will also contact the National Database Registration Authority (NADRA) to verify the CNICs of suspects above the age of 18. Additionally, efforts will be made to obtain the B-Form of suspects under the age of 18.

1,Tree plantation app develops errors,Online facility aimed at monitoring activities in govt schools,"A mobile application launched by the Punjab government to involve schools in a tree plantation campaign aimed at countering environmental degradation and global warming has failed to take off.
The provincial authorities had launched the ‘Plant for Prosperity’ app to engage 48,000 government schools to plant trees during the ongoing spring season. 
However, the Punjab School Education Department has informed the Punjab Information Technology Board (PITB) chairman and the wildlife and fisheries department about problems reported in using the app.
The school education department stated in a letter sent to the PITB chairman and the wildlife and fisheries authorities that the app was not functioning in all districts as the teachers and other users were facing problems in using it.
As per the plan, the government had engaged thousands of schoolteachers in all districts in the tree plantation this year after highlighting environmental issues and the impact of global warming.
All district education authorities’ chief executive officer (CEOs), education officers and head teachers had been asked to use this app to shares photographs of tree plantation during the spring season. 
A senior official of the Punjab School Education Department told The Express Tribune that tree plantation had been started across the province following the instructions issued last month but the campaign was faltering due to issues related to the app and the teachers were also ignoring the guidelines after failing to access the online facility.
The official remarked that the school administrators had already been facing financial constraints in implementing the tree plantation campaign but when they observed that the app was not working, they got an excuse to stop the activities. The app was supposed to provide the basis for evaluating the performance of the officials involved in the campaign.
He said the teachers were already coping with heavy workload because of preparing for the annual exams and also performing census duties. Now they also have to participate in tree plantation. ""Still we have written to the department concerned to solve the problems being facing in using the app,"" he added.
The official said complaints of errors in the app had been received from across the province. He expressed hope that the issue would be resolved.
He said a large number of trees had to be planted in about 48,000 government schools in the province.
""All users are facing issues in logging in, which is preventing them from using the app. The issue needs to be addressed urgently. Unless the login issues are resolved, the app will remain inaccessible to users,"" the Punjab School Education Department stated in the letter.
The Plant for Prosperity app has been launched for government departments of Punjab for plantation under an urban and peri-urban forest policy. 
An official of the forestry and fisheries department said all government departments had been contacted for the tree plantation.
He said the role of the school education department was important for the success of the plantation initiative in the province.
