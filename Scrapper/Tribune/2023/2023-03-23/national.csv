0,Panel finalised for SBP deputy chief,Govt notifies Saifullah Dogar as senior adviser to IMF executive director,"The government has finalised a panel for the appointment of new deputy governor of the central bank and also notified a new senior adviser to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as the vacation of both positions in the past few months was proving costly for Pakistan.
The government notified Saifullah Dogar as senior adviser to the executive director of the IMF after the global lender endorsed Pakistan’s nomination. Dogar is currently serving as a joint secretary in the external finance wing and is dealing with IMF affairs.
The position of the senior adviser had been vacant for over three months after Dr Saeed Ahmad completed his term. Ahmad is likely to be appointed as the new deputy governor of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), as his name tops a three-candidate panel for the post.
According to sources, the finance ministry on Tuesday dispatched a summary to the Cabinet Division for placement before the cabinet for its decision. The other two candidates are Ashraf Khan and Qasim Nawaz, who are currently serving in the central bank.
Dogar was interviewed by the IMF a few days ago and after that his three-year appointment notification was issued by Pakistan. He will take charge of his responsibilities later next month. A finance ministry official confirmed the new appointment at the IMF.
The appointment of the senior adviser is being made at a time when Pakistan’s relations with the IMF are seemingly strained. After meeting many harsh conditions like increasing electricity, gas and fuel prices, and jacking up interest rate, the government suddenly made an irrational move by announcing a petrol subsidy of Rs50 per litre. IMF’s Resident Representative Esther Perez told The Express Tribune that Pakistan did not consult it in advance before announcing the subsidy and the IMF had sought details, which included “protections against fraud and abuse”.
Sources said that the government’s subsidy decision had further increased difficulties for the finance ministry, which was already struggling to convince the IMF to announce a staff-level agreement.
Dogar will not only have to deal with these difficulties brought about by the derailed programme, but will also have to lay the groundwork for a new IMF programme.
Pakistan’s continued erratic and fiscally irresponsible decisions have created a wide gulf between Islamabad and the IMF staff, management and executive board. Nobody is ready to trust Pakistan anymore, according to Washington-based sources.
Some informal pressure groups were also working to further widen the trust deficit. Dogar has to work hard to bridge this gulf through background contacts.
Dealing with Pak-IMF relations is a small but important part of the senior adviser’s job. The senior adviser also assists the IMF executive director, who represents eight countries on the IMF executive board.
In addition to this, the senior adviser is also required to assist the executive director in dealing with financing requests from member countries, submit Article-IV reports of members and handle policy papers.
Sources said that under such circumstances, Pakistan needed its representative in the IMF to convince its board members about the dire need for a bailout programme and mend its relationship with the lender.
Finance ministry sources said that a summary had been moved for the consideration of federal cabinet for the appointment of third deputy governor of the SBP. The post has been vacant since January 26 in violation of the SBP Act that demands filling such posts within one month.
Finance ministry sources said that Dr Saeed Ahmad was the favourite candidate due to his experience in monetary policy. The central bank faces issues of lack of human resources on the monetary policy side after its experienced people either left the bank or went on leave.
The summary has been moved two weeks before a scheduled meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee that is again set to increase the interest rate in the range of 2% to 3%.
Earlier this month, the central bank increased the rate by 3% but it was below expectations of the IMF, which wanted a major hike to contain a 50-year high inflation.
Dr Saeed Ahmed and Ashraf Khan had also been considered for the post of SBP governor last year.
The amended SBP Act states that deputy governors shall be appointed by the federal government after consultation between the minister of finance and the governor, from amongst a panel of three candidates recommended by the governor for each vacant position, in order of merit.
In the order of merit, Ahmed is on top of the panel. He has experience in monetary policy, economics and central banking with 35 years of management practice, and substantive experience in international finance and development, monetary policy formulation, financial inclusion, and development finance policy.
He is a PhD in Economics from the University of Cambridge and did MSc in Economics from the University of Warwick, the UK.

1,UBS buys back bonds,Repurchase highlights efforts to shore up sentiment,"UBS Group said on Wednesday it would buy back 2.75 billion euros ($2.96 billion) worth of debt it sold just days ago in a bid to boost confidence among bondholders rattled by its $3 billion rescue of rival Credit Suisse.
The bonds were sold on March 9 and their repurchase by UBS highlights the lender’s efforts to shore up sentiment since its government-backed rescue of Credit Suisse on Sunday.
UBS is buying back the bonds at the price at which they were sold rather than at market prices, compensating investors after a sell-off this week. “They’re trying to be friendly to investors who purchased just before the mess,” said Jerome Legras, head of research at Axiom Alternative Investments.
UBS in a statement said it was buying back a 1.5 billion-euro 4.625% fixed-rate note due March 2028 and a 1.25 billion-euro 4.750% fixed rate note due March 2032.

2,Chinese firms to promote renewable energy,Solar goods exhibitor says Pakistan should opt for industrial transfer from China,"“The lately closed three-day Pakistan Solar Exhibition provides a unique platform to build partnerships with local governments and private sectors to find innovative solutions,” said Chinese exhibitor Howard Fu.
At this expo, “we display product solutions dedicated to the local market, so as to further promote the development of renewable energy in Pakistan.” Howard, Pakistan Country Director of a Chinese power supplying company, had a bumper harvest at the show, signing a total of 100MW+ distribution deals.
The product portfolio displayed in the exhibition includes residential solar-plus-storage solutions, commercial and industrial solutions, and “1+X” Modular Inverter for utility-scale markets.
Pakistan is a fast-growing country with chronically tight energy supplies. It has a clear competitive advantage in photovoltaic (PV) power generation due to abundant light and land.
More people are choosing renewable energy because of its competitive leveled cost of electricity (LCOE).
The increasing influx of foreign investment into the solar market encouraged by the government is also bringing more technology to the country. Pakistan has invested billions of dollars in solar projects to encourage businesses and individuals to invest in solar power and increase the share of renewable energy to 60% by 2030.
Mark Gong, Sales Manager of another Chinese power company, was optimistic about the solar energy industry in Pakistan and expressed his strong determination to continue participating in such exhibitions and play his part in raising public awareness of solar energy options to advance solar energy in the country’s metropolises and non-matrix regions.
“China is a leading country in PV. Pakistan lacks an industrial base for photovoltaic products, while it, as the sixth most populous country in the world with a huge consumer market and abundant human resources, has the advantages to undertake industrial transfer from China,” remarked exhibitor Eric Zhao.
It was the second time Eric has attended the solar expo, and he feels the heat of market atmosphere even more.

3,Project team urged to start work on Mohmand Dam,WAPDA chief calls for completing diversion of Swat River this year,"Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) Chairman Engineer Lt Gen (Retired) Sajjad Ghani has urged project management to complete work on diversion of Swat River in the current year.
“It is essential to commence work on the main dam,” he stressed and directed the Wapda project team, consultants and contractors to execute the construction plan within the given timeline.
Ghani expressed those views during his visit to the Mohmand Dam and Hydropower Project, being developed by Wapda on Swat River, upstream of Munda head works in Mohmand district of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.
He visited a number of sites to examine the ongoing construction activities and was given a presentation by the project management on the progress made so far.
It said that construction activities on 14 key sites of various components were being carried out simultaneously, including a diversion system, dam spillway, re-regulation pond, switchyard, etc.
Work on concrete lining in the diversion tunnels was progressing at a fast pace to achieve the target of river diversion. Excavation work on left and right abutments of the dam was complete, while strengthening of the foundations of the two abutments was in progress.
Excavation work on the spillway was 80% complete and concrete lining was being done on the portions that had been excavated. Earthwork of the switchyard had been completed, said the presentation.
Mohmand Dam is a concrete-faced, rock-filled (CFR) dam, which is the fifth highest dam of its type in the world. It is a multi-purpose project and is scheduled for completion in 2026-27.
On completion, it will store 1.2 million acre feet (MAF) of water and help mitigate floods in Peshawar, Charsadda and Nowshera.
Besides supplementing 160,000 acres of existing land, it will also irrigate 18,237 acres of new land in Mohmand and Charsadda.
Its installed power generation capacity is 800 megawatts, which will contribute 2.86 billion units of low-cost and environment-friendly hydel electricity per annum to the national grid.

4,Tech-based agri-revival must for economy,"Experts stress biotechnology can address food challenges, ensure sustainable supply","Speakers at a biotechnology moot on Wednesday demanded that the government must ensure modern technology-based revival of the agriculture sector to lift the faltering national economy.
Addressing the seminar titled “Challenges, Opportunities and Trends in Biotechnology in Pakistan”, organised by the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) and Pakistan Academy of Environmental Sciences (PAES), they stressed that biotechnology had the potential to address the country’s food challenges and ensure sustainable food supply for future generations.
They believed that the use of latest biotechnology had a significant impact on agriculture, crop yields and food sources, enabling farmers not only to produce more crops but to meet the challenges of climate change in the present situation that impacted yield.
Lack of awareness and understanding and access to financing, less research and development capabilities, limited regulatory framework, infrastructure limitations and socioeconomic factors were the challenges hindering the adoption and implementation of biotechnology in Pakistan’s agriculture sector, they pointed out.
Pak-EPA Director General Farzana Altaf Shah underlined the importance of emerging technologies and solutions in making farmland cultivation a more manageable and profitable business. Four Brothers Group Chairman Engineer Jawed Salim Qureshi highlighted the role of private sector in introducing biotechnology. He noted that it was high time to take ambitious and bold decisions to improve the national economy and agricultural production.
Qureshi was of the view that the agriculture sector alone had the ability to boost the economy through timely interventions. “There is an urgent need to start the use of modern technology, early warning and best scientific practices, emphasised Tara Group Chairman Dr Khalid Hameed.

5,Rupee continues upward march,"Rupee increased by 0.25%, or Rs0.70, to Rs283.20 against the US dollar","Pakistani rupee maintained its uptick for the second consecutive working day on Wednesday, increasing by 0.25%, or Rs0.70, to Rs283.20 against the US dollar in inter-bank market.
The gradual recovery of the currency came in the wake of a slowdown in demand for US dollars for imports, which were partially closed amid financial crisis in the country.
With the latest increase, the rupee regained 0.28%, or Rs0.81, in two days. It came following appreciation of 0.82%, or Rs2.32, to Rs284.03 against the greenback on Monday.
Market talk suggests that the supply of foreign currency has slightly improved in the inter-bank market, as overseas Pakistanis are sending higher remittances to their family members back home to help them cope with high inflation during Ramazan, which is set to begin on Friday.
Historical data suggests the inflow of workers’ remittances peaks each year before and during Ramazan.
Moreover, the rupee maintained its uptick on reports that it had become significantly undervalued. Any permanent recovery, however, will come once the inflows surge.

6,Further rate hike unlikely to control inflation,SBP expected to increase policy rate by 100-200 basis points,"Pakistan’s economy has slowed down significantly partly due to a persistent hike in the key policy rate to a record high at 20%. The rate hike has lately become “ineffective” and a further rise will only aggravate the economic woes.
The policy rate is a tool available with the central bank to control inflation caused by a pick-up in demand for goods. The central bank has said in the past that it could not control supply-side inflation like the increase in energy tariffs.
The rate hike has made bank financing expensive for industries, households and the government, which is the largest borrower. More importantly, the high policy rate and other administrative measures are badly hitting exports and worsening the current account deficit.
The textile sector, which is the largest export earner, is said to be on the verge of default, indicating a situation that may lead to the collapse of banks like that in the West in recent weeks.
Reports suggest the central bank is considering increasing the key policy rate by 100-200 basis points.
Talking to The Express Tribune, Arif Habib Limited (AHL) economist Sana Tawfik said “aggregate demand for banking credit has already slowed down…gone dead. Contraction in the growth of large-scale manufacturing sector is an example of that.”
“A further hike in the rate will be ineffective in relation to controlling inflation, as this is coming from the supply side. Rather, the hike will worsen economic activities in the country.”
She said the massive devaluation of the rupee against the US dollar was already fulfilling the purpose to fix the faltering economy and “there is no need to further increase the rate.”
The biggest casualty of the rate hike would be the government itself rather than supporting it in overcoming the economic and financial crisis. The government is the largest borrower from domestic banks and has taken 83% of total deposits in loans.
“A one-percentage-point hike in the key policy rate is estimated to increase the government’s interest payments by Rs90-100 billion in a year.”
Another analyst said interest payments would surge by Rs175-200 billion in a year following a one-percentage-point rise in the rate.
He said the government should open imports for the export sector like textile as the growth in exports was the key to increasing foreign earnings, narrowing down the current account deficit and improving the balance of payments.
“The government should prioritise import of raw material for the export sector like the way it ensures import of petroleum products.”
The government may continue to keep a check on imports for domestic consumption.
On the other hand, a little growth in economic activities including domestic consumption is a must to let people keep their jobs and collect the targeted tax revenue this year.
Experts said the economic growth may drop in the range of 1% to slightly negative in the current fiscal year compared to 6% growth in the previous year.
Tawfik said AHL had projected that the central bank would hike the key policy rate by 100 basis points to 21% in its monetary policy meeting scheduled for April 4, 2023.
The bank may increase the rate on the recommendation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to revive the stalled loan programme, which has become a must to unlock foreign funding of billions of dollars.
“The IMF has recommended increasing the rate to ensure there is no way left to create demand for credit and cause inflation,” she said.
The IMF says the government may increase social spending to protect the vulnerable segments, but who would ensure it reaches the deserving people, she said.
Secondly, when the economy is slowing down, its revenue collection remains lower than the requirement and it is largely relying on bank financing to meet budgeted expenditures, then how the government would increase social spending.

7,Exporters decry delay in sales tax refunds,Say govt’s apathy pushing industries towards collapse,"Export-oriented industries are under extreme financial crunch and are facing losses of billions of rupees as their liquidity remains stuck due to delay in release of sales tax refunds.
“The government has stopped releasing all the sales tax refund claims whereby exporters’ precious liquidity worth billions of rupees have been stuck,” Value-Added Textile Forum Coordinator Muhammad Jawed Bilwani said at a joint press conference of value-added textile associations held at the Pakistan Hosiery Manufacturers & Exporters Association (PHMA) House.
“The prime minister, finance minister and their economic team have completely ignored the export sector, mainly the value-added textile sector, which is on the verge of collapse owing to the government’s anti-business and anti-export mindset,” he lamented.
The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has issued Sales Tax General Orders (STGO), which have caused further disruption in the processing of sales tax claims, without consultation with the stakeholder associations, Bilwani said.
Earlier, the exporters were happy with the functioning of the FBR’s FASTER system, which was processing claims electronically as per law and rules without any delay.
The FASTER system was introduced to end human intervention and process the sales tax claims electronically, while the new parameters introduced in the STGO involving FBR officials will defer the sales tax claims and again open the floodgates to corruption, Bilwani remarked.
According to an estimate, approximately 60% of exporters’ liquidity is lying frozen with the FBR. As a result, the textile export industry has become unviable and is on the verge of collapse.
Besides, a sharp decline in exports and foreign exchange earnings is hindering production while the country’s economic managers are not giving any heed to the repeated distress calls to save the export industries facing the most difficult times in history.
Industries continue to suffer due unavailability of gas and uninterrupted power supply, shortage of industrial inputs/ raw materials caused by restrictions on opening of Letter of Credits (LC), discontinuation of DLTL and Regionally Competitive Energy Tariff.
“The Prime Minister has no time to meet the exporters as four scheduled meetings during last four months have been postponed in a row,” he regretted.
Pakistan’s textile exports dropped significantly by 11% in February 2023 to $1.18 billion, Topline Securities textile sector analyst Nasheed Malik stated.
“The decline was primarily due to a decrease in the value-added textile exports, such as ready-made garments and knitwear that went down 13% and 18% respectively,” he added.
In terms of volume, exports of knitwear, towels, and bed-wear exports fell by 16%, 10%, and 9% respectively, whereas exports of ready-made garments increased by 15%. This decline indicates a wider deterioration in global textile demand as major textile exporting countries such as Bangladesh, China, and Vietnam have experienced similar declines.
During 8MFY23, textile exports in Pakistan amounted to $11.22 billion, indicating a YoY decline of 11.
“The major exports markets, such as the USA and Europe continue to be a concern for Pakistan’s textile sector as demand from those markets is on decline,” Malik cited.
For FY2023, we expect textile exports to be in a range of $16-17 billion as compared to the target of $25 billion.

8,SC gives interim relief against deemed income tax on real estate,FBR faces tough task of collecting Rs560b in one week to meet revenue target,"The Supreme Court of Pakistan on Wednesday granted interim relief against the 20% deemed income tax on real estate, which will partially dent revenue collection, as taxmen face a gigantic task of collecting Rs560 billion in one week to achieve the nine-month revenue target.
Headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Justice Umar Ata Bandial, a special bench allowed taxpayers to pay only 50% of the assessed deemed income tax until final decision was made by the apex court.
The court made some sharp remarks about the performance of Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and its focus on an already limited taxpayer base to achieve targets.
The apex court barred the FBR from taking any adverse action against the taxpayers, if they deposited half of the assessed tax, according to the interim decision.
Faisal Siddiqi advocate represented the petitioners in the court, which also inquired from the FBR about the constitutional mandate to slap taxes in an area which was within provincial domain.
Realty and manufacturing sectors have filed petitions against Section 7E that the government introduced in June last year to impose taxes on people who derived income equal to 5% of the fair market value of capital assets situated in Pakistan, who will be charged tax at the rate of 20%.
The FBR says the effective tax rate is 1%, aimed at collecting an additional revenue of Rs15 billion. Initially, the estimate was Rs25 billion, which the FBR reduced after the government excluded some sectors from the scope of the tax, which was also contested by the petitioners, terming it discriminatory legislation.
For the current fiscal year, the government has set the annual tax collection target of Rs7.640 trillion for the FBR. For the July-March period, the target is Rs5.43 trillion, but the FBR collected Rs4.87 trillion as of Wednesday.
This leaves it with a balance of over Rs560 billion, which it has to collect in the remaining six working days with an average of Rs94 billion a day. A major tax injection is expected on Friday and Monday.
During the first eight months, the FBR claimed that it sustained a Rs213 billion shortfall but the Ministry of Finance and the Accountant General for Pakistan Revenue data suggested a shortfall of Rs233 billion.
Any further shortfall will bring performance of the FBR under critical review. It is struggling to achieve the targets despite a Rs170 billion mini-budget and record inflation of 31.5%. But so far the FBR has been unable to cash in on the high inflation reading through higher sales tax collection.
The International Monetary Fund may also ask Pakistan to take additional revenue measures against any monthly shortfall, according to sources.
Sources said that against March target of Rs727 billion, the FBR had so far collected Rs377 billion, or 52% of the target. Sales tax collection remained at Rs147 billion, higher by just 7%.
The FBR needs to collect Rs276 billion in March on account of sales tax just to meet the monthly target.
So far, the income tax collection has remained exceptional, showing 35% growth for the month.
The Supreme Court remarked during the hearing that the FBR was not a trusted organisation and it was again burdening those who were paying their taxes.

Section 7E has faced serious constitutional challenges since the beginning as many argue that the government may find it difficult to defend the legal provision in courts that falls within the purview of provincial taxation.
The Sindh High Court (SHC) had given the decision in favour of the FBR but its legal team on Wednesday could not provide solid reasons to satisfy the court whether the FBR had taxed real estate assets or the income.
The matter had also been challenged in the Lahore High Court that wrote in its interim order that Section 7E taxation had been done on the basis of “speculative value of the property”, which appeared to be in contradiction to Section 116 that deals with the wealth statement being submitted by a taxpayer along with the tax return.
The petitioners prayed before the apex court whether Section 7E was in violation of Entry 47 and Entry 50, Fourth Schedule, Constitution 1973, as it can neither be considered as deemed income from property nor it is in the legislative competence of the federal legislature to enact such a law on the market value of immovable property.
The petitioners submitted that the SHC misinterpreted and misapplied the Ellahi Cotton Mills Limited vs Federation of Pakistan judgement in holding that there were no limits to the concept of deemed income even though the Ellahi Cotton judgement holds that there are limits to the notion of deemed income.
Petitioner Khalid Mehmood is the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of the largest pharmaceutical company, Getz Pharma (Pvt) Limited, in Pakistan. He owns more than one immovable property and, thus, comes within the scope of Section 7E.
The petitioner’s immovable properties have been duly declared in his income tax returns. The petitioners also pleaded before the court that Section 7E was discriminatory, which is evident from the fact that certain individuals, along with their successors-in-interest, are exempted from the applicability of the deemed income tax.
