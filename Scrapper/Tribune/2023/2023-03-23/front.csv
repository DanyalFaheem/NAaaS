0,PTI eyes SC intervention over ECP’s move,Says election supervisor violated Constitution by delaying Punjab polls," 
PTI Chairman and former premier Imran Khan on Wednesday said that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had violated the Constitution by putting off the Punjab Assembly elections till October, asking everyone to stand behind the legal community “with expectation that they will protect the Constitution”.
“By postponing Punjab elections till Oct ECP has violated the Constitution. Today everyone must stand behind the legal community - the judiciary & lawyers - with expectation that they will protect Constitution. For if this is accepted today then it is the end of Rule of Law in Pak,” the PTI chief wrote on his official Twitter handle.
His tweet came shortly after ECP withdrew its notification regarding polls in Punjab scheduled for April 30, postponing elections for the provincial assembly until October 8.
In another tweet, the former premier maintained that they had not dissolved the Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa assemblies to “allow a bunch of fascists to impose a reign of terror”.
“We dissolved our 2 provincial legislatures with expectation that elections would be held in 90 days as clearly given in our Constitution. We did not take this action to allow a bunch of fascists to impose a reign of terror, violating the Constitution & Rule of Law.”
Reacting over the commission's decision, PTI leaders said the commission had violated the Constitution and disobeyed the apex court order to hold elections in Punjab as per the constitutional obligation.
PTI Senior Vice President Fawad Chaudhry said the ECP had violated the Constitution, noting that all its members who signed the notification to postpone elections in the province were guilty under Article 6 of the Constitution.
""Judges and lawyers, it's now your movement before anyone [else’s]. If you fail State will call people of Pakistan will stand behind Supreme Court and the Constitution,"" he tweeted.
In another tweet, the PTI leader lamented that after the ECP’s decision the Constitution and the apex court had virtually been “abolished” and the country was now without a Constitution.
“The Constitution and the Supreme Court have been effectively abolished, Pakistan is now without a constitution.”
PTI leader Andleeb Abbas said all institutions and parties which assisted the commission to take the decision should be punished under Article 6 of the Constitution.
Without naming any party of the coalition government, she said, “no matter what you do you cannot run away from elections”.
PTI leader Musarrat Jamshed Cheema termed the ECP’s decision “gross violation” of the Constitution that would not go unpunished.
The party will not allow anyone to snatch the fundamental right of the people of Pakistan, she said.
Meanwhile, the PML-N hailed the ECP’s decision to delay elections, saying elections in Punjab and K-P could not have been held separately.
Talking to The Express Tribune, Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb observed that the election commission had taken the decision in view of the financial and security situation of the country.
She said elections in two provinces could not have been held separately, stressing that polls in the entire country should be held at the same time.
When asked that holding polls within 90 days was a constitutional requirement and the delay was seemingly unconstitutional, Marriyum said the ECP had taken the decision in the light of the Constitution.
She said Constitution did not allow holding elections separately in the country, without specifying the article as the Constitution explicitly states that polls upon dissolution of provincial assembly should be held within 90 days.
The information minister noted that the spirit of Constitution demanded that elections are held in a peaceful atmosphere, when the country has “sufficient funds”.
On being questioned whether delaying of elections would provide credence to PTI’s allegations that the ECP was working on the whims of PML-N, Marriyum stated that until recently the former ruling party had been appreciating the election supervisor for taking the “right decision” to announce polls in Punjab on April 30.
She said PTI stood by an institution when a decision by them came in the party’s favour and opposed them when the contrary happened.
PPP’s senior leader Hassan Murtaza, who seemed a bit taken aback by the ECP’s decision, talking to The Express Tribune said that he was not aware of the details.
However, he said PPP had never supported abrogation of law.
We cannot even think of supporting any violation of Constitution, he said, adding that his party gave Pakistan Constitution.
Murtaza said he was on his way to an event in connection with the election campaign.

1,All eyes on CJP after ECP volte-face,Senior lawyers see strong chances of SC striking down commission's move as 'constitutional overreach',"All eyes are set on Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial in the wake of the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) surprising volte-face on Wednesday to postpone the Punjab elections, originally scheduled for April 30, till October 8.
CJP Bandial – who has already made it clear that the Supreme Court would interfere in case the polls were delayed –  had earlier invoked suo motu jurisdiction to hold general elections of both provincial assemblies within 90 days.
Now, the electoral watchdog’s announcement has potentially thrown the ball back to the SC’s court, renewing debate whether the top court – which was divided over ideological lines – would compel the ECP and executive authorities to hold elections of two provincial assemblies immediately.
The twist comes at a time when a section of SC judges is being accused of ‘tilting the scales’ in PTI’s favour is purportedly revealed in an alleged video leak of Muhammad Khan Bhatti, former principal secretary to ex-chief minister Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi, in which he accused some judicial figures of supporting the PTI.
On the other hand, another group of SC judges was not in favour of invoking suo motu jurisdiction in this matter.
Senior lawyers believe that in order to end controversies, CJP Bandial should constitute a full court to hear the matter regarding the delay of elections.
PTI’s lawyer Chaudhry Faisal Hussain also agreed with the assertion that a full court should take up the matter and decide whether the constitution or the “law of the jungle” would prevail in the country.
Echoing Hussain, another PTI lawyer protested that it was high time that the jurists of the apex court raised above their egos and decided the matter. He pointed out that now the caretaker government’s ability to perform would also be called into question, recalling that the five-member larger bench had held that the caretaker government had no authority to spend public money beyond 120 days of its tenure.
“Now it remains to be seen as to how the Punjab government works in light of the constitution as well as SC ruling,” he wondered.
Moreover, senior lawyers agree that SC should have adjudicated Justice Athar Minallah's questions examining the constitutionality regarding the dissolution of provincial assemblies.
It is pertinent to note that the court in its order had said that Justice Minallah's questions would be considered at any other stage.
According to a senior lawyer, the questions were still relevant.
The legal fraternity is of the view that it would have been better for the PTI if the assemblies had been restored, allowing it to control the largest province till the general election. However, one section of lawyers termed it a “constitutional conundrum”
They said that the SC should stay away and for a change compel the political parties to sort out this mess. Nonetheless, they agreed that now it will be impossible for the SC to be seen as an 'impartial arbiter'
The lawyers further opined that the top court’s contempt proceeding in this matter will risk further eroding public confidence as it had now turned into a political question.
""SC has put itself in a difficult position. The sou moto should not have been taken and LHC allowed to conclude its proceedings. But the five members were in a hurry and in the process, they damaged the institution,” said a lawyer.
They said that if the apex court stayed away, all political parties might sit for a political solution to the matter.
‘Blatant mockery of constitution’
Reacting to the development, ex-senator Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar said that delaying the elections by the ECP was a blatant mockery of the constitution and alleged that the body had surely decided this on the wishes of the government and the establishment which are terrified of the polls.
""With already a tarnished reputation sadly ECP now has no credibility left,” he said.
‘Constitutional overreach’
Lawyer Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar while commenting on the present situation said that in the presence of clear provisions of Article 112 read with 224 (2) of the Constitution as well as in view of SC judgement, such postponement and rescheduling could legally be considered to be constitutional overreach on the part of the commission, and totally against the spirit and beyond to their mandate given under the constitution.
He further said that the rescheduling of the election schedule in Punjab was beyond the mandate of the ECP both in view of the constitutional provisions and of the Election Act 2017.
If there was any need to change or reschedule the election under any circumstances, it could only be amended or changed or extended by the commission with the prior concurrence of the president, and not otherwise as clearly mentioned in the language of section 58 of the Election Act 2017.
The lawyer said that there was a strong chance that the ECP’s order would be struck down by the Supreme Court once challenged or brought to the notice of it with regard to the court’s continuation of earlier proceedings.
The legal expert also said that the country can only move on in all perspectives including in areas of political and economic stability if all state institutions would act in accordance with their legal mandate and perform their functions as per the spirit of the constitution.

2,IMF shrugs off ECP’s funds blockage claim,Foreign lenders says govt has to reprioritise expenses to meet constitutional obligations,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Thursday rejected Pakistan’s claim that its programme conditions were one of the reasons for delaying polls in Punjab, saying Islamabad had the right to reprioritise expenses or raise additional taxes to meet constitutional obligations.
“There is no requirement under Pakistan’s EFF [Extended Fund Facility]-supported programme, which could interfere with Pakistan’s ability to undertake constitutional activities”, said Esther Perez Ruiz, the resident representative of the IMF.
The statement came a day after the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) postponed elections in Punjab  till October 8, citing lack of security and finances to hold elections in the  province.
It also suggests that the trust deficit is deepening between Pakistan and the IMF because of Islamabad’s inability to meet its international as well as domestic constitutional obligations and blaming the global lender for its own failures.
It is for the second time in the past four days that the IMF has rebuked Pakistan’s claim about interfering in matters that did not fall in the domain of the $6.5 billion bailout package, setting the record straight and refusing to offer its backing to the politics of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM).
Earlier, Ruiz had said he wanted to be categoric that there was absolutely no truth to any insinuated link between the past as well as the current IMF-supported programmes and the decision by the Pakistani government over its nuclear programme.
In the statement issued on Thursday, Ruiz elaborated: “The IMF sets aggregate general government targets [aggregating across federal and provincial government levels] and within these there is fiscal space to allocate or reprioritise spending or raise additional revenues to ensure constitutional activities can take place as required.”
The ECP requires Rs20.5 billion for holding elections in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.
It needs another Rs5 billion for conducting by-elections for 93 vacant seats of the National Assembly.
In total, the ECP requires Rs25.5 billion, which is not much compared to Rs11.2 trillion revised annual budget for this fiscal year.
The needed funds are equal to just 0.18% of the annual budget of the federal government.
The IMF resident representative further stated that decisions about the constitutionality, feasibility, and timing of the provincial and general elections vested solely with Pakistan’s institutions.
Just this week, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet approved a Rs27 billion supplementary grant to avoid default on diesel payment to Kuwait.
Two days ago, the planning minister launched politically-oriented development projects for the youth of the country costing Rs150 billion.
In its elections postponement notification, the ECP narrated a statement by the federal finance secretary.
“[The] secretary finance while briefing the commission stated that due to the paucity of funds and financial crunch, the country is facing an unprecedented economic crisis and it was under compulsion by the IMF programme which has set targets for maintenance of fiscal discipline and deficit,” it read.
“[The finance secretary said] it would be difficult for [the] government to release funds now for general elections [for] the provincial assemblies of Punjab, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and later for [the] general elections [for the] National Assembly, [and the] provincial assemblies of Sindh and Balochistan,” it added.
The ECP further stated that the federal government had conveyed that because of the critical economic situation of the country, it would be very difficult to provide funds for the elections at the moment and additional money for the staggered polls.
The details showed that in case of segregated elections, the additional cost was Rs9.3 billion.
Last month, the federal cabinet had revised the budget estimates to Rs11.2 trillion -- an increase of Rs1.3 trillion or 17% over the one passed just eight months ago.
The government has also revised the estimate of provincial surpluses downwards to Rs559 billion, compared with the budgetary figure of Rs750 billion.
As a result, the overall deficit has been projected at Rs5.7 trillion, or 6.8% of the GDP.
For its programme purposes, the government has set the primary deficit target at Rs465 billion, or 0.5% of GDP, compared with the previous target of Rs153 billion in surplus.
This month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also announced free wheat flour schemes worth Rs73 billion in the two provinces where the elections were due under the Constitution.
The cost of these schemes, funded by provincial governments, is almost three times more than the funds needed for holding the elections in the two provinces.
The Rs73 billion spending on wheat flour subsidy might jeopardise the recently agreed fiscal framework with the IMF that requires Rs559 billion provincial cash surpluses.
The sources said that K-P had informed the prime minister that it did not have the entire Rs19 billion funds to finance the free wheat flour scheme.
The plan is to give free wheat flour to 5.7 million families in the province.
The IMF’s country head said the programme discussions had exclusively focused on economic policies to solve Pakistan’s economic as well as balance of payments problems, in line with the the global lender’s mandate for promoting macroeconomic and financial stability.
Pakistan and the IMF programme remains stuck because of the lack of fulfillment of conditions for around $6 billion additional loans and interest rate hike.
