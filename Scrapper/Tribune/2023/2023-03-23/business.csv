0,Man kills his four-year-old daughter,Wife alleges daughter had been abducted and killed after she refused to return home to husband,"The Thall police in Hangu district have arrested a man for killing his four-year-old daughter after he failed to convince his wife to return home. 
DPO Hangu, Asif Bahadur, told media persons during a press conference that a woman named Saadia Bibi lodged a report with police on March 13 that her daughter was missing from home.
She alleged that her second husband, Faraz, was involved in the abduction of her daughter. She said she was living with her mother along with her daughter while her jobless husband was in Hangu.
She further told police that her husband had come to her mother's house to take her back, but she refused as her husband was unable to provide them with the necessities of life.
She said her husband most probably took her daughter to Hangu with him, following which the girl was missing. The police arrested the man who confessed to the crime and said he had thrown his four-year-old daughter into the Indus River near Attock after killing her.
Regretting his action during the investigation, he told police that he wanted to take revenge on his wife for her irresponsive attitude.

They said that a strike by teachers and other faculty of the university in the wake of the killing of a security supervisor followed by unplanned spring vacations had wasted a lot of their time. 
They said that approximately 15,000 students were enrolled with the UoP and had paid millions of rupees under the heads of tuition fees, admission, examination, hostels charges, transport, security and others but still their precious time was being wasted by the university administration on one pretext or the other. 
Danial Aziz, a student of the varsity said the protesting faculty had warned to prolong their strike till Eid if their demands were not met, adding that in strife between university administration and teaching faculty, the students were suffering, and no authority was ready to realise that the precious time and semester of students would be wasted if the strike continues. 
Different students' unions had also staged a camp at the main gate of the university and blocked it for all kinds of traffic for the early reopening of the university and revival of educational activities.

2,Stay issued on police seniority list changes,110 petitions were filed in PHC by affected cops,"The Peshawar High Court (PHC) issued stay order on Wednesday against making changes in the seniority list of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) police officials on 110 petitions filed by the affected cops.
A two-member bench, comprising Justice SM Ateeq Shah and Justice Shakeel Ahmed, issued the injunction order and sought replies from the inspector general (IG) of the police and the provincial chief secretary.
During the hearing, Barrister Dr Adnan Khan appeared on behalf of the petitioners and raised two points in his arguments. He pointed out that there was out-of-turn promotions of mostly those who earned honours during the performance of their duties.
This rule, he said, was applicable in all police forces but now those cadets were being demoted to bring them on the merit of other officials. He added that a larger PHC bench had already directed the provincial government to review the relevant laws.
Also, the lawyer pointed out that in the 1980s, the then IG had issued a standing order that if someone spent three years as an instructor in Hangu, he would be given an out-of-turn promotion. Therefore, those policemen could not be brought at par with others.
Barrister Adnan Khan said that there were two separate decisions of the Supreme Court in 2013 and 2017 regarding ending the out-of-turn promotion policy, but added that both the decisions were related to the police forces of Punjab and Sindh.
Now, the K-P police were demoting their decorated officers and those who promoted in the 1980s on the basis of these decisions. He pleaded with the court that once a policy was framed and someone benefited, it could not be withdrawn.
Later, the court issued the injunction order in this matter, staying any change in the seniority list of police officers. The bench sought replies from the IG and the chief secretary and adjourned further hearing of the case till April 4.
CCI asked to include regional languages in census
A two-member bench of the Peshawar High Court (PHC), comprising Justice SM Atiq Shah and Justice Shakeel Ahmed, while hearing a petition filed to include some languages spoken in different regions of the country in the census, sent the matter to the Council of Common Interests (CCI).
It also issued instructions to the council that after reviewing all the issues, the council should take steps to include these languages in the census form.
During the hearing, Shahid Ali Yeftali, the counsel for the petitioners, told the court that a new census is currently being conducted across the country.
Three regional languages are not included in the census form, thus depriving their speakers of the opportunity of being counted, so the court should issue an order to include them in the census form.
After the arguments were completed, the bench issued an order to refer the matter to the CCI and issued instructions to the council
It directed that after reviewing all the issues, steps should be taken to include these languages in the census form.
