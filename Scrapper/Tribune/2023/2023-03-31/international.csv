0,Prominent Hindu doctor gunned down in 'targeted hit',Dr Genani had served as the head of the Spencer Eye Hospital,"Prominent ophthalmologist Dr Birbal Genani was shot dead and his assistant injured after unidentified men shot them near the Garden Interchange of the Lyari Expressway in Karachi on Thursday. 
The deceased doctor had his private practice in Ranchore Line area in downtown from where he was headed home when he was attacked.
Widely respected, Dr Genani had also served as the head of the Spencer Eye Hospital in Lea Market. He was also the director of medical and health services at the Karachi Municipal Corporation. He made headlines last year as part of the father-daughter duo that did their MBA together. 
According to Jamshed Quarter Superintendent of Police Zubair Tanoli, who was at the crime scene, Dr Genani had taken his usual route. He left his private clinic and was headed towards the interchange to take the expressway for his residence in Gulshan-e-Iqbal. 
When he was near the expressway entrance, armed men on a motorcycle shot at him. Two bullets hit him in the head proved fatal. Dr Quratul Ain, 32, had worked with Dr Genani for almost a decade. She was in the car and injured in the shooting. She was taken to the hospital for treatment. 
Police found shells of 9mm bullets at the scene of the incident.
SSP City Arif Aziz, who was also present at the spot along with a heavy contingent of law enforcement, said that it would be premature to say anything about the motives. “It seems the attackers were well aware of Dr Genani’s movements and routes,” he said. 
Police added they were collecting CCTV footage and recording statements of witnesses.

2,Govt hospitals limit surgical facilities,Critically ill patients forced to undergo expensive private operations,"As the dollar rate reaches unprecedented levels, a spike in costs of medical paraphernalia instigates the placement of limitations by government hospitals on various lifesaving procedures. 
Where inflation has already reduced the purchasing power of the vast majority, those seeking treatment for terminal illnesses like cardiac disease and kidney failure, are crushed, as they are denied treatment in district government hospitals and are redirected instead to expensive private medical centres. 
“The hospital admits patients when they visit the emergency department but neither are the required tests conducted nor are the treatment surgeries performed,” complained Javed Khan, a patient at the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD). According to sources, out of the 14 major hospitals in the port city, up to seven have reduced the number of surgeries being performed. These hospitals include Dr Ruth KM Pfau Civil Hospital, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical College, Lyari General Hospital, Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, Karachi Institute of Heart Diseases, National Institute of Child Health (NICH) and National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD).
Concurrently, an anonymous source also revealed to the Express Tribune, that of all the diagnostic and surgical procedures being carried out in Karachi, a whopping 70 per cent were conducted in private hospitals, whereas the public sector only served 30 per cent of the patients. 
While a denial of treatment to any patient raises humanitarian concerns, raising eyebrows at the government’s lack of sensitivity, the matter becomes much worse with the revelation that a large number of the surgeries which have been suspended in government facilities concerned cardiac and renal patients, whose vital organ failure requires immediate medical attention. 
In this regard, a cardiac patient at NICVD, Rao Ashfaq, while talking to The Express Tribune, shared, “when I visited the out-patient department (OPD), I was told that I required an immediate angiography for diagnosing my heart condition. After three days, I was told that an important instrument for the procedure, a stent, was unavailable and that I should switch to the hospital’s private executive facility, which was unaffordable for my family.” 
The private facility at NICVD, which operates 3pm onwards, charges Rs30,000 for an angiography, Rs300,000 for an angioplasty and as much as Rs600,000 for a coronary bypass surgery, thereby depriving the low-income strata of the hope for recovery. 
Similarly, patients with kidney failure were denied treatment at multiple government hospitals and were also advised to seek the procedure at private hospitals, which dealt with 70 per cent of the dialysis patients in the city and charged almost Rs15,000 per session. Given that the average renal patient requires at least three dialysis sessions per week, the monthly expenditure in that case amounts to Rs180,000 per month, which is back breaking for the average uninsured, middle class patient. 
On the other hand, where some district hospitals like Sindh Government Hospital at Liaquatabad and Saudabad are devoid of a dialysis unit, others like Sindh Government Hospital New Karachi and Ojha Hospital suffer from a paucity of beds and specialised equipment. Furthermore, sources claim that no chemotherapy or radiation facilities are available in most of the district government hospitals for the treatment of complex ailments like blood, bone marrow, and jaw and mouth cancers. 
Such a dearth of medical facilities comes despite the fact that billions are allocated annually by the Sindh government for the health sector. Commenting on the severity of the plight terminally ill low-income patients are facing, a doctor at NICVD said, “since much of our medical equipment is imported, the recent surge in the dollar rate has overburdened our finances. As a result, we had to cut back on the number of medical procedures being performed in the government facility of our hospital.”

3,Hindu community stages protest against police apathy,"Demand recovery of missing girls, legislation against forced conversions","Marvi Meghwar travelled more than 550 kilometres from her village in Ghotki's Mirpur Mathelo to Karachi after police in her hometown refused to register a case of abduction and alleged forced conversion of her daughter. 
Marvi, who is a member of the Hindu community, says her daughter was abducted on March 19. She feared that the girl had been forcibly converted and married off by her abductors in Rahimyar Khan. 
""Our community visited police station several time but the police were unwilling to register the case,"" says Vijay, who accompanied his mother to Karachi. 
The Meghwars were among hundreds of protesters of the minority community who protested outside the Sindh Assembly on Thursday demanding an end to forced conversion. The community contends that girls are abducted and converted before being married to elder men.
The protesters, who initially camped outside the press club before moving to the legislative assembly, demanded that their complaints are lodged in police stations in their area. 
The rally was organized by Pakistan Darawar Ittehad (PDI) with people from as far as Umerkot, Badin, Tharparkar, Mirpurkhas, Nawabshah, Ghotki, Sukkur and other districts participating in it. 
The participants, carrying placards, chanted slogans against forced conversion and the police apathy.
""The police do not listen to us,"" said Faqir Shiva Kuchhi, the chairman of PDI. ""They do not even lodge FIRs on our complaint,"" he added.
According to Kucchi, 164 girls were allegedly abducted and converted in 2022. ""The number could be more as some of the parents do not come forward,"" he added. 
The rally participants also complained that state institutions were not taking the issue seriously, including abduction of their girls.
They also criticised public office holders of the Hindu community for inaction over it. 
""We elected them and sent them to the assemblies but they do not care about our abducted children,"" a speaker said. 
Sunny Kumar, another participant at the protest, told The Express Tribune that his sister was abducted in August 2020. ""Our FIR was never registered,"" Kumar said. ""The kidnappers in all such cases are so powerful and we as Hindus do not have any say,"" he said.
Showing his sister's photos, he said that Simran had a psychological condition. ""They [abductors] do not even leave people with such conditions,"" he said. 
Demands
In a 15-point agenda, the rally participants demanded the government to pass legislation against forced conversions; to implement the Child Marriage Restraint Act; and representation to Kuchhi, Bheel, Meghwar, Kolhi, Thakur, Baghri, Jogee, Rebari, Odh and other lower caste Hindus in upper and lower houses of parliament.
They also demanded the immediate resumption of the Thar Express so that Hindus could go to their religious places and festivals easily. The occupied lands, graveyards, temples and plots belonging to the Hindu community should immediately be retrieved. They also demanded that separate graveyard land should be allocated for Hindus. 
The protesters said they would continue the protest until they had received assurance that their demands had been heard. 
No political leader had visited the protestors till the time of the filing of this report.

4,Tailors charge premium as orders overflow,Raise stitching charges for kurta shalwar by 25 per cent,"A rise of Rs300 in the wages of men's tailors has been witnessed before Eid this year. Subsequently, tailors have shifted the burden to the customers by raising the charges to stitch men's kurta shalwar from Rs1,200 to Rs1,500.
Those who work in dressmaking and stitching say that in addition to the wages of workers, the cost of materials and electricity has also skyrocketed. It has also resulted in people opting for ready-to-wear clothes instead of getting them stitched. 
Leading up to and during Ramazan, there is a visible increase in demand for new clothes. It has been the same this year despite inflation and declining value of rupee impacting purchasing power. 
Tailors remain busy and orders continue to pour in, with one tailor saying that he is likely to stop taking orders for delivery at Eid. 
Seasonal tailors have also emerged, as is the norm during this period, who charge lower rates than permanent tailors. This is because their ability and stitching quality are inferior to those offered by permanent tailor shops, said one buyer. ""Despite the increase in stitching costs, people still go to their permanent tailors,"" they said. 
Early bird
The fabric for the Eid dress is often purchased and handed over to the tailor in the first week of Shaaban, the month preceding Ramazan in the Islamic calendar. 
Some tailors accept orders from individual clients in Ramazan as well to deliver high-quality tailoring and charge whatever they want. 
Eid orders can only be placed up to the fifteenth day of Ramazan in advance. In the first week of Ramazan, popular tailoring shops and men's tailoring centres in the city display new booking boards.
Changing patterns
While stitched and tailored have always been a sartorial preference, frequent power outages and increasing costs mean that there has been an increase in the demand for ready-to-wear dresses. 
It has led to tailors establishing workshops and make-shift karkhanas in areas where power outages are comparatively less. A hefty amount of tailoring work takes place at night, when there are fewer power outages. In most cases, the business owner uses gas-powered generators are used in case of power outages.
Stylistic preferences
Clothing with embroidery carries a higher price than clothes without such adornments. Besides tailoring, embroidery, sewing machine repairing, scissors sharpeners, thread buttons, and other auxiliary materials are also associated with the job of tailors. 
Younger buyers prefer minimal embroidery on their shirts and kurtas. The suits with embroidery on the front side in addition to the collar and sleeves have also found a niche. 
However, embroidery carries an additional cost of Rs300 to Rs500 depending on the style. The cost of stitching for embroidered suits is also considerably higher than average. Cotton suits are more expensive to stitch than wash and wear clothing. 
Workforce
Majority of seasonal workers in these shops are from outside the city. They often stay at the shop and stitch day and night. Most of these people are daily wage labourers. 
The average daily income of workers this year is about Rs2,000. Workers in small tailor shops might earn up to Rs1,500 per day.
Stitching hubs
Major menswear tailoring centres in Karachi are Kareem Centre and Cooperative Market in Saddar where orders are taken until the third Ashra (last ten days of Ramazan). The charges of stitching also increase as Eid gets closer. 
Tailors work till late on the eve of Eid (chand raat) and stitch clothes for themselves and their families. Shops tend to remain open the whole night once Eid moon has been sighted so that clothes can be delivered before the Eid prayer in the morning.
After that, it is a week of well-deserved rest for the stitching community. But they are back at it soon after as weddings tend to continue for the next couple of months till Zil Hajj.
