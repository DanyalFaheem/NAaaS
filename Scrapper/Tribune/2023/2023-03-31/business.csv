0,Hindu trader wins Muslims hearts,Offers 50% off on fabrics in Ramazan; sale attracts hordes of customers,"A Hindu cloth merchant in Battagram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has won the hearts of Muslims by offering a generous 50% discount on all items during the holy month of Ramzan. The merchant, Jacky Kumar, has put up a large banner in front of his shop ‘Ram Cloth House’ in the busy Ajmal Bazaar to attract visitors to the discount offered on fabrics for both men and women. Kumar, who has been a resident of Battagram for generations, explained that the offer was made as a gesture of reverence for the holy month of Ramzan and the upcoming Eid.
Kumar’s idea came to him when a Muslim friend expressed his inability to purchase new clothes for his children. As a result, Kumar decided to offer a discount to the inflation-hit locals. Suits worth Rs1,400 are being sold for Rs750, and those with a price tag of Rs2,000 are now available at half price, Rs1,000. The discount offer, which began on March 28, will remain valid until the end of Ramzan. Within two days of the announcement, a large number of people rushed to Kumar’s shop, and he sold around 5,000 suits.
Kumar’s goodwill gesture has been met with surprise and jubilation by almost all customers, including men and women who availed of the offer. They expressed gratitude and made many prayers for providing them relief at a time of economic stress. Kumar remarked that he was content with the response and that the monetary loss was nothing compared to the satisfaction one gets from doing good for humanity. He also revealed that he would provide stitched clothes to orphaned Muslim children up to 12 years of age for the upcoming Eid.
However, some local fabric dealers have expressed resentment over the sale offer, which, according to them, has badly impacted their business. Dilip Kumar, a shopkeeper at Ram Cloth House, said that although the decision was made for the welfare of the masses, it had received backlash from some local businessmen. Nonetheless, the discount offer has been highly praised by people in the area, with many from Battagram and adjoining districts visiting Ajmal Bazaar to avail the offer.
Jacky Kumar’s initiative is an excellent example of interfaith harmony and respect for other religions among the people of Pakistan, said Haroon Sarab Diyal, Chairperson All Pakistan Hindu Rights Movement. As an elder of the Hindu community, Sarbdyal added that they were delighted to learn that this initiative was taken by one of their community members, which reflected the soft image of Pakistan.
“The value of suits being sold at Ram Cloth House nowadays are even less than the factory rate and has been highly hailed by people of the area,” said Ehsan Naseem, a local journalist from Battagram.

3,Dam to supply potable water to Peshawar,CM assures full support for the project which is expected to cost Rs107 billion,"Advisor to the Caretaker Chief Minister Malik Mehar Ilahi on Thursday called on Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) Caretaker Chief Minister Muhammad Azam Khan and discussed with him the important greater water supply scheme for Peshawar city as the chief minister assured his all-out support for the project.
The chief minister was informed that the project has been in limbo for over two decades despite the importance of this mega project to provide clean drinking water to the households in the city and its suburbs.
He was informed that clean drinking water will be provided to the district from the under construction Mohmand Dam. 
A one kilometer tunnel is required to provide the water to a treatment plant where it would be purified and filtered and then supplied to Peshawar district.
“If materialized, the scheme would provide 294 million gallons water per day,” said the advisor, adding that the construction of the tunnel is part of the Mohmand Dam which will be constructed by WAPDA.
“If this important water supply project is completed then it will solve the water scarcity problems for the growing district population for a long time,” he maintained, adding that the underground water level in Peshawar was going down with each passing day and it has already touched a dangerous level.
The CM on this occasion assured that every effort would be made to start and complete the project on priority.
It is worth mentioning here that the provincial government proposed clean drinking water supply project for Peshawar from the under construction Mohmand Dam back in 2021.
However, the project will cost Rs107 billion, therefore, the provincial government asked the centre for financial support.
According to K-P Local Government Department sources, a plan to supply clean water from Mohmand Dam to Peshawar has been sent to Islamabad stating that the estimated cost of the project is Rs107.55 billion which the province cannot afford on its own.
It has been requested to include the project in the proposed Public Sector Development Program of the Fiscal Year 2022-23, i.e. the development program of the federal government so that all the expenses to be incurred on it are borne by the Centre or the provincial and federal governments together.
Another plan has also been proposed to supply water from Jabba Dam to Hayatabad and Khyber tribal district while for the rest of Peshawar, clean water will be provided from the under construction Mohmand Dam.
In the past when Haji Ghulam Ali was the district nazim of Pehawar, he proposed a gravity water supply scheme from Warsak Dam to Peshawar but it didn’t materialize due to lack of funds as well as support from the provincial government as the government refused to fund this vital water supply scheme.
