0,People complain of problems at flour points,Citizens say they were denied bag of flour due to faults during scanning of their cards,"Some people have made complaints against the working of the free flour distribution centres. 
The government has launched a scheme to provide free flour to the people during the holy month of Ramazan. For the implementation of free flour scheme, 10 free flour distribution centres have been established at various important places of the tehsil, including Chichawatni city. 
Two flour distribution centres have been established at Rai Ali Nawaz Cricket Stadium and Sharminda Road for the urban population of 100,000.
Similarly, for the rural population of one million of tehsil, one flour distribution centre each has been established at eight important places of the tehsil, Kassowal, 68 Mor, Okanwala Bangla, Ghaziabad, 90 Mor, Dadfatihana, Iqbal Nagar and Mauza Kamand.
It has become clear that the number of free flour distribution centers is not enough compared to thousands of deserving people who want to avail the facility of the free flour scheme. 
According to the complaints received from the Free Flour distribution centres, some people had had their ID cards scanned and then an objection was raised that their ID cards did not have a SIM card so it could not be scanned. But when the disappointed people returned home empty-handed and sent messages at 8070 again, they received messages that they had received bags of flour. Dozens of people were being affected daily by this confusion at all the centres. 
Altaf and his wife, Rasheedan Bibi, residents of Chak No. 114, Bara L, went to the centre in Chichawatani to get flour and the staff returned their ID cards saying that their ID cards could not be scanned. But when they went back home and messaged 8070 again, they got a message that they had gotten a bag of flour.
Similarly, another couple went to the respective centre to get flour where the staff after scanning their ID card said that they had already received one bag, now the second bag would be available after 10 days.

3,Experts advocate small water reservoirs,Call for modern irrigation techniques to avert scarcity,"Speakers at a workshop organised by the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) on Thursday stressed the need of small water reservoirs to meet challenges posed by climate change.
They said Pakistan had been listed in top 14 countries facing water scarcity and 80 per cent of the available water was being used to irrigate the wheat and rice crops.
Modern techniques of irrigation would have to be used to avoid water scarcity.
The speakers said about 1.2 million tube wells in Punjab had badly disturbed the groundwater level that had rapidly declined in Lahore, Multan, Lodhran, Minchanabad, Vehari and some other areas in past 10 years. 
The speakers explained the importance of water governance and how better management of resources could help ensure availability of water for different sectors, especially agriculture and industry.
They discussed the significance of the Punjab Water Act 2019 and challenges in its implementation.
They highlighted risks of climate change being faced by Pakistan, including the last flood resulting in $30 billion loss, 1,700 deaths and affecting 33 million people.
IWMI Pakistan Country Representative Dr Mohsin Hafeez said the organisation was working on reforms such as water accounting and resources assessment, data, allocation system, groundwater management information system and irrigation demand management to promote sustainable use of water in Punjab.
The IWMI through a UK Aid-funded programme has selected Okara as the pilot district for the implementation of water accounting and resources assessment reforms.

5,Extra duties deplete teaching resource,"Census, exam duties exacerbate school staff shortage","The Punjab School Education Department faces a challenge of starting the new academic year on Saturday with a shortage of around 200,000 teachers.
According to sources, the department has demanded the services of around 50,000 schoolteachers to supervise exams in the province, while another 50,000 teachers are already engaged in census duties.
There is already a shortage of around 100,000 schoolteachers in the province due to lack of recruitment in recent years.
The school education department has asked the chief executive officers concerned in all districts to provide human resource for conducting the matriculation and intermediate exams across Punjab. 
The matriculation exams as well as the new academic year are scheduled to begin on April 1.
Officials in the department told The Express Tribune that around 50,000 schoolteachers would be engaged for the duties at the examination centres across the province.
A senior official of the Punjab School Education Department said the administrators and headmasters of the institutions were declaring their inability in resuming the academic activities because of staff shortage. 
There was already a shortage of around 100,000 schoolteachers. Since last month, 50,000 teachers of government schools in the province are engaged in census duties. 
The official wondered how the schools would be able to start the new academic year despite an estimated shortage of 200,000 teachers due to vacant posts as well as the exam and census duties.
“There are hundreds of schools in Punjab where only two or three teachers are serving.
When the department will acquire the services of half of the staff for census and exams duties then who will teach in the new academic year,” the official said.
He said the children from poor families were affected the most by the shortage of teachers in the government schools.
The official said a large number of textbooks had also not been printed for free distribution among the students.
He said the higher authorities had not taken notice of the situation faced by the government schools.
A leader of the Punjab Teachers Union said there would be a severe shortage of teachers and textbooks at the beginning of the academic year. 
The teachers serving i. the schools will face the most stressful situation when the academic activities begin this week.
He said the government should intervene to find a solution. for the teachers and students of the government schools.
He pointed out that the schools had also been given a target to increase the number of enrolled students despite the lack of resources.

8,Wild pets endanger safety of residents,Authorities’ failure to take action has exacerbated the issue,"Where in most countries the enthusiasm of animal lovers to observe the glory of wildlife would draw a majority to a zoo or reserve, in the city of gardens they need only step out on the streets.
In recent times, the novel trend of keeping wildlife animals as pets at home has grown tremendously and has simultaneously raised valid concerns among the civil society and state authorities alike, who cite the killer instincts of the carnivores as a significant source of potential danger to the citizenry.
“Keeping dangerous wild animals at home, means risking not only your own life but also of the innocent people nearby,” said an official from Wildlife Punjab.
According to sources, various influential families in the provincial capital have kept wild animals like lions, leopards, and even pythons as pets at home, creating a troublesome situation for the neighbours, who fear stepping outside the house.
One such case was found in the Tajpura area of Lahore, where a citizen had kept multiple lions on his rooftop, and would regularly take them out for morning and evening strolls in the nearby market, petrifying the passersby.
“One does not usually expect to run into a lion when they leave their house to buy groceries,” shared a distressed neighbour. He further added, “after all it is a marketplace, not a zoo.”
Even when the neighbours did file a complaint to the local police, the lions continued to lurk around, eventually forcing the families to adapt to the persistent risk.
While some lion keepers limit their pet’s detours to the nearest market, others flauntingly take their furry fellows for a day out in their cars.
As a local from Lahore confirmed, “while waiting in my car at the traffic light, I was terrified to spot a lion’s head sticking out from the window of a car nearby.”
While such instances trigger considerable backlash from residents who fear for their safety, domesticated wild pets also raise a red flag for animal rights activists, who argue that removing wild animals from their natural habitat and modifying their bodies to customise them for domestic life with humans, is a rather cruel practice to begin with and can also instigate uncontrollable aggression in the pet.
According to Anneza Khan Omer Zai, an animal rights activist, wild animals are not fit for household environments and the ones that are kept at home usually have their teeth and claws removed by the owners to control the lethality of a future attack, “which causes intense physical pain to the animal, who can become agitated and even vicious, as a result.”
“Many owners are also not aware that wildlife animals acquire various neurological diseases over time, which can drastically alter their behaviour, causing them to react aggressively at the slightest trigger,” asserted Aneeza.
Syeda Izzat Fatima, an animal rights lawyer, believes the solution lies in implementing legislation like the Big Cats Safety Act, which exists in the United States. “No one should be permitted to keep wild animals as pets in the house nor should anyone and everyone be allowed a licence to keep wild animals.”
Acknowledging the condemnation posed by the residents and civil society, officials from Wildlife Punjab conceded to the severity of the matter, revealing that while containing wild animals in breeding centres was allowed, keeping them as pets at home was illegal.
“While no formal data exists at the provincial level to determine the exact number of privately owned wild pets, we will be working towards curbing the problem and will confiscate any wild pets which are not officially registered,” assured Junaid Alam, Deputy Director of Punjab Wildlife.
