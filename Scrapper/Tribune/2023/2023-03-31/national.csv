0,OCAC proposes changes to motor fuel pricing mechanism,Urges govt to increase OMC margin to Rs7 per litre immediately,"Oil marketing companies (OMCs) in Pakistan face several challenges with regards to pricing motor fuels. Through a letter addressed to the Minister of State Petroleum Division Musadik Malik, the Oil Companies Advisory Council (OCAC) proposed several changes to the existing pricing mechanism to ensure the viability of the industry.
One major challenge that the industry is facing relates to negative Inland Freight Equalisation Margin (IFEM). The OCAC suggested that the IFEM should be removed to avoid burdening the cash flow of OMCs. Furthermore, an independent mechanism should be developed to manage adjustments, and negative IFEM should be discontinued in the next price change. The federal government has also been manipulating the IFEM to maintain artificial control on oil prices, which has led to the current negative levels.
OMCs are also bound by oil marketing licenses to maintain fuel stocks for 20 days, which is a financial challenge. The OCAC recommended that OMC Margin should be immediately revised to Rs7 per liter in line with dealers’ margin. This will partially mitigate the challenge.
Letters of Credit (LCs) confirmations have also been a challenge for OMCs due to increased country risk, leading to high charges that impact the industry’s viability. Additionally, processes around LC confirmations have caused disruptions in berthing schedules, which incur demurrage costs. The OCAC suggested that these costs be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and reimbursed as a pass-through cost through a separate line item in fuel pricing.
The industry has also faced issues related to high Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) on purchases made through debit/credit cards. These charges, coupled with the negative IFEM, have severely impacted OMCs’ cash flows.
Despite only partial success in meetings with the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor, the OCAC has appreciated the continued support of the government during these challenging times. While, the SBP confirmed the removal of the lower limit on MDR, the central bank stated that it could not advise banks to enhance oil industry’s limits as it is a commercial matter.
The OCAC stated that the existing oil pricing mechanism has been causing serious financial issues for the oil industry, which will impact its capacity to operate. It is essential to take immediate action to address the issues related to negative IFEM and L/C confirmation charges, while revising OMC margins and developing an independent mechanism to manage adjustments.

1,‘GSP Plus not being adequately utilised’,Ex-Punjab governor urged businesses to play role in enhancing exports to EU,"Former Governor Punjab Chaudhry Muhammad Sarwar said that he had played an active role in getting the GSP-plus scheme from the European Union for Pakistan and is still working hard to get an extension of this scheme.
Addressing the business community during his visit to the Islamabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ICCI), he said, “Pakistan will hopefully get the EU GSP-Plus facility for the next ten years. However, Bangladesh has increased its exports by five times with the GSP plus scheme, while Pakistan has not yet taken full advantage of this facility.”
Urging the business community to utilise the facility of the scheme to enhance exports to the EU, he said, “Exports and remittances combined brought around $300 billion to Pakistan in the last five years, but even today we were forced to accept every condition of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for just $2 billion. An outcome of our inappropriate strategy.”
“The business community has a key role in the development of the economy as it creates jobs, promotes wealth creation and boosts tax revenue,” he said, adding regretfully that about 20 departments are hindering the efforts of the business community due to which doing business in Pakistan is becoming difficult. “Many overseas Pakistanis have achieved great progress and if they were given better incentives, many of them would have been keen to invest in their home country.”

2,Shanghai Electric extends KE offer date,Renews commitment to acquiring Karachi-based private power utility,"China’s state-owned Shanghai Electric Power Company (SEP) has renewed its commitment to acquiring K-Electric (KE) as pending financial disputes of billions of rupees on KE books and regulatory approvals delayed the transaction for over half a decade.
In a notification to Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Thursday, KE said that it had received intimation from transaction manager Arif Habib Limited (AHL) on behalf of SEP that the “acquirer (SEP) is extending the date for public announcement of offer by 90 days pursuant to regulation…Substantial Acquisition of Voting Shares and Takeovers.”
“Therefore, the time for making the public announcement of offer in respect of the transaction is extended till June 27, 2023. This has been notified to the target company (K-Electric) on March 29, 2023.”
Over six years ago in October 2016, the Chinese firm had agreed to acquire 66.4% shares in KE from the existing foreign shareholders at a price of $1.77 billion.
Sources close to the deal told The Express Tribune that the previously offered price stood null and void and SEP would re-evaluate KE and come up with a new price when it got the required approvals.
Citing reasons, they pointed out that KE had been awarded new power tariffs for end-consumers since October 2016. Besides, the rupee has devalued by more than 100% against the US dollar in six years. Accordingly, KE’s value has changed significantly.
The manager to the deal said in a notification that parties under the transaction had taken all reasonable steps for obtaining regulatory approvals as required under the applicable laws of China as well as from the domestic regulatory bodies as required under the laws of Pakistan.
“Certain of these approvals are, however, yet to be issued and as such the parties under this transaction cannot complete the transaction before receipt thereof.”
A source said that Pakistan’s interior ministry had yet to issue a no-objection certificate (NOC) for the transaction. “The ministry considers it a ‘strategic transaction’ and wants to make sure no national interest is compromised.”
The ministry wanted to know whether the Chinese firm could sustainably supply electricity to KE’s existing consumers which included around 2.7 million household, industrial and commercial users, he said. Moreover, KE is yet to resolve the issue of receivables of billions of rupees from the government and Karachi Water and Sewerage Board. On the other hand, the Karachi-based private power utility is to clear outstanding dues of Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) for gas supply.
He was of the opinion that the “Chinese firm may not execute the sale-purchase agreement (SPA) in the extended 90-day period as well, as the government is pre-occupied with political issues and busy dealing with the IMF to end economic crisis and revive the $6.5 billion loan programme.” He hoped that the transaction would take place once the new government was formed and some time was given to resolve the pending issues pertaining to the KE transaction.
The AHL notification added that parties under the transaction would continue to apply all efforts in expediting the approvals and processes.
“We may mention, however, that a number of these conditions require the relevant regulatory authorities to seek internal approvals from various line ministries and departments with processes beyond the control of acquirer.”
The deadline for making the public announcement of offer was March 29, 2023. However, the acquirer would like to intimate Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) and Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) that the acquirer is extending the date for the public announcement of offer by 90 days, it said. Earlier, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had formed a task force in June 2022 and assigned former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, who headed the task force, the responsibility of resolving all pending issues hampering the KE business deal within three months.

3,Garments industry for stopping audit notices,Says every exporter is being served 10 notices,"Pakistan Readymade Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association (PRGMEA) has asked the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to help strengthen the industry and exporters by timely releasing sales tax refunds, instead of sending them audit notices.
In a statement, the association pointed out that more than 51% of tax revenue was being collected from the manufacturing sector, though its share in gross domestic product (GDP) was just 13%.
On the other hand, it said, the agricultural sector, which constituted more than 26% of GDP, was not fulfilling its national obligation and was paying just 2% of income tax.
PRGMEA Central Chairman Mubashar Naseer Butt underscored the need for widening the tax base and bringing the agricultural sector to the tax net.
“The FBR, instead of facilitating the industry, creates problems for the manufacturers and exporters,” he said, adding that tax collectors had started sending audit notices to the exporters, though they were required to swiftly release tax refunds.
“On average, 10 audit notices are being served on almost every exporter, who is fed up with the long delay in refunds.”
“It’s the question of survival in the backdrop of an acute liquidity crunch and we need the government’s help to save the industry from bankruptcy,” appealed PRGMEA Vice Chairman Waseem Akhtar.
He called for ensuring ease of doing business, lowering cost of production, providing a solution to the liquidity crunch through early refund payments, drawing up a long-term and consistent energy tariff policy and relaxing the import policy for industrial raw material.
Airing concern over the withdrawal of competitive power tariff of Rs19.90 per unit, Akhtar pointed out that it led to a further decline in textile and overall national exports, which was ‘alarming’ and ‘unfortunate’.

4,Textile exporters urge FBR to fix ‘Faster’ refund system,"Claim the delays are causing a liquidity crunch, hampering exports","Textile exporters in Pakistan have raised concerns about excessive delays in processing sales tax refunds and have urged the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to address the flaws in the Sales Tax General Orders (STGO) and rectify technical glitches in the FBR’s sales tax faster system. According to the exporters, these delays are causing a liquidity crunch and hampering exports.
“The FBR’s sales tax ‘faster’ system was introduced to ensure that textile exporters could enjoy sales tax refunds within 72 hours, which helps them avoid a liquidity crunch and smoothen their working capital. However, the system is malfunctioning, and textile exporters are not getting their sales tax refunds,” said Ali Asif, a textile sector analyst at Insight Securities.
The Pakistan Hosiery Manufacturers & Exporters Association (PHMA) has noted misleading content in the FBR’s Sales Tax General Order No 09 of 2023, which alleged that the STGO was finalised after deliberations with PHMA and other textile associations. PHMA denied any such role as alleged by the FBR.
According to Muhammad Jawed Bilwani, the Patron-In-Chief and former chairman of PHMA, the FASTER system was fully functional and was properly processing the refund claims of exporters. Every exporter was happy with the functioning of FASTER, and taxpayers are not responsible for any glitches, if any, as it is the responsibility of the FBR.
President of Union of Small and Medium Enterprises (UNISAME) Zulfikar Thaver said, “If the FBR does not expedite claims as promised, the system is defective and it becomes tedious as funds get blocked.” He also stressed that any system made must be made with proper consultations and deliberations with stakeholders.
The FBR in its STGO 09 of 2023 has claimed that the FASTER system “continued to malfunction on multiple counts producing suboptimal outcomes and was found deficient in effectively analysing the admissibility of refund in relation to quantity and quality of inputs claimed by taxpayers, resulting in allowing portion of refund relating to such inputs which otherwise were not liable to be allowed either on the basis of excess consumption or otherwise being inadmissible under law.” However, the FBR has not given any evidence or reasoning in support of its claim, according to Bilwani.
“The PHMA participated in the FBR meeting held on March 1, 2023, assuming that the meeting was held to address the delays in processing refund claims of exporters. However, PHMA was not part of any due-deliberation to upgrade the automated system by incorporating benchmarks and input/output ratios, according to Bilwani. The exporters have urged the FBR to take swift action to address the issues and ensure a smooth and efficient system for businesses.

5,Forex reserves fall by $354m to $4.24b,SBP cites external debt repayment as reason for decrease,"The foreign exchange reserves held by the central bank fell by 7.7% on a week-on-week basis to $4.24 billion, according to data released by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Thursday.
On March 24, 2023, the SBP’s foreign currency reserves stood at $4,244.3 million, down by $354 million compared to $4,598.7 million on March 17.
The central bank attributed the decrease in foreign exchange reserves to the external debt repayment.
Overall, the liquid foreign currency reserves held by the country, including the net reserves held by banks other than the SBP, stood at $9,815.9 million. The net reserves held by banks amounted to $5,571.6 million.
Ismail Iqbal Securities Head of Research Fahad Rauf recently said that any significant improvement in Pakistan’s foreign currency reserves depended on the revival of International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) loan programme and the inflow of fresh financing from other multilateral and bilateral creditors.
“They (FX reserves) are projected to rise to around $7-8 billion by the end of current fiscal year on June 30, 2023,” he said.

6,Rupee regains 0.09% on talk of Saudi assistance,Creeps up to Rs283.66 vs dollar in inter-bank trade,"The stabilising Pakistani rupee ticked up on Thursday, regaining 0.09%, or Rs0.26, and closed at Rs283.66 against the US dollar in inter-bank market.
Market talk suggests the rupee registered the fresh nominal gains on reports that Saudi Arabia had signalled its willingness to give financial commitments to Pakistan. However, the size of the assistance package is not known.
Earlier, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) linked the revival of its $6.5 billion loan programme with the receipt of new financial commitments of $6-7 billion from friendly countries.
In another development, the currency dealers operating in open market offered the government $24 billion in loans over the next two years. For the purpose, they need the government’s permission to borrow from overseas Pakistanis and foreign firms.
A dealer said that the government’s response to the offer was awaited, which would help Pakistan to get rid of the IMF programme and shift focus on to stabilisation and growth of the economy.
Meanwhile, China is considering rolling over a loan of $2 billion for Pakistan.
On the flip side, however, the foreign exchange reserves have dropped by $354 million in a week to the critically low level of $4.24 billion, which is barely enough to finance one month of imports.
The rupee had lost 0.13%, or Rs0.37, to Rs283.92/$ on Wednesday, according to the central bank data. The currency has continued to move in a narrow band of Rs281-284/$ for the past four weeks.

7,ECC okays outsourcing of airports,Approves advisory agreement with IFC against heavy drawbacks for Pakistan,"The government on Thursday approved an advisory service agreement with an arm of the World Bank Group to hand over operations of three of Pakistan’s international airports to a foreign country, providing its political backing to conclude the deal at the earliest.
According to a handout from the Ministry of Finance, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet approved the draft Transaction Advisory Agreement (TASA) reached with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) by Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCCA) to outsource three airports.
The draft agreement, however, appears in favour of the IFC due to protections provided in the shape of penalties, in case Pakistan decides to terminate the contract.
The ECC endorsed the same old terms to which it had objected four days ago after the IFC – a member of the World Bank Group – refused to take its advisory fee towards the conclusion of the transaction. The fee will be paid on achievement of various milestones. In addition to that, if Pakistan decides to terminate the service agreement at any stage, it will have to pay penalties.
Pakistan has agreed to pay the fees to the IFC on achievement of milestones. On submission of the inception memo, the IFC will get $200,000, and on a draft technical report of three airports it will receive another $300,000. On submission of the transaction structure, $200,000 more will be paid while an amount of $300,000 will be paid on the request for proposal and bid evaluation. The IFC will get $6 million as success fee on completion of outsourcing of three airports, $2 million fragmented against each airport.
As per the draft, for failing to pay the due fee to the IFC in a timely manner, Pakistan will pay interest rates of 0.1% over and above the Federal Reserve Bank of New York benchmark rate. Sources said that some of the ECC members objected to endorsing the IFC-favoured transaction advisory agreement, but the ECC overruled those objections and allowed the PCCA to sign the agreement.
If Pakistan terminates the agreement after its execution, but prior to delivery of the Transaction Structure Report, it will pay $1.5 million in penalties to the IFC, according to the draft agreement.
If the termination occurs after the presentation of the transaction structure report, but before the delivery of the final request for proposal, it will pay a $1.8 million penalty on account of three failed deals. If termination occurs after the delivery of the final request for proposal, Pakistan will pay the IFC a termination fee of $2.4 million.
The finance ministry stated that the ECC was informed that outsourcing of the three airports has been initiated within the scope of the Public-Private Partnership Act-2017 (PPPA 2017) to engage private investors and airport operators through a competitive and transparent process. This will develop appertaining land assets and enhance avenues for commercial activities and to garner full revenue potential, it added.
The government took the PPPA-2017 route to complete the transaction on fast track. The IFC has been qualified as a transaction advisor.
Earlier this week, the ECC had deferred the summary and instructed the secretaries of the Aviation Division, and the Ministries of Privatisation and Law to meet and bring clarity as to whether the outsourcing of the said airports can be undertaken within the scope of PPPA 2017. It had also asked to explore the possibility of payment of milestone fee by the successful concessionaire at the close of the transaction instead of the PCAA.
In 2019, Qatar had shown interest in taking over the management, operation, and development of the New Islamabad International Airport, Lahore’s Allama Iqbal International Airport and Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport. The IFC informed Pakistan that it would not be possible for it to delay the payments against the milestone fee until the end of the transaction. The corporation, however, did agree that as suggested by the ECC, the entire milestone fee paid by the PCAA could be recovered from the concessionaire at the time of awarding concession as in the case of success fee. As a result, this will bear no cost for the PCAA.
As per the draft, the investor or the operator will be required to take an entrepreneurial risk and make a sizable investment into improving the airport infrastructure as well as to leverage the potential of acquiring lands to the maximum extent. Most of the functions being undertaken, including the collection of various fees and charges, and services being presently provided by the PCAA at these airports will be handed over to the investors.
Other decisions
Apart from this, the ECC approved a supplementary grant worth Rs7.3 billion to carry out politically oriented projects in Sindh, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas. It approved Rs607.6 million in favour of the Ministry of Energy (for the execution of development schemes in Sindh).
The ECC also approved Rs1.7 billion in favour of the Ministry of Housing and Works for the execution of development schemes under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Achievement Programme (SAP) in K-P and Sindh. It also sanctioned Rs5 billion in favour of the Ministry of Housing and Works for the execution of development schemes in erstwhile FATA.
The cabinet body further approved the Declaration of Commerciality and Field Development Plan over Hilal and Iqbal discoveries in favour of M/s Mari Petroleum Company Limited (MPCL), and granted a second two-year renewal over the Kirthar exploration block license to the Polish Oil and Gas Company Limited. Additionally, the meeting granted permission of extended well testing over Ghazi-1 discovery to MPCL.

8,NTDC failure to cost consumers Rs80b,Requested adjustment of Rs6.7b due to failure to evacuate power from Thar coal-based plants,"National Transmission & Despatch Company (NTDC)’s failure to lay transmission lines to evacuate electricity from Thar coal-based power plants has come under fire again, with concerns that this could burden consumers with a cost of up to Rs80 billion.
Despite the reduction in electricity rates for February 2023, on account of fuel adjustment charges, consumers of power distribution companies (Discos) may still face higher tariffs if previous adjustments of Rs6.3 billion due to system constraints are allowed. The tariff could increase by Rs0.85 per unit if such adjustments are allowed.
During a public hearing conducted by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), NTDC requested an adjustment of Rs6.7 billion due to the failure of evacuating power from Thar coal-based power plants. This was met with serious concerns from NEPRA, which questioned why NTDC had not made proper planning and due diligence to lay the transmission lines, taking into account the timelines of Thar coal-based power plants.
The hearing revealed that electricity demand would increase during the summer, and the country would require higher electricity generation. NTDC officials said that two transmission lines were already in place to evacuate 1400 MW electricity, with two more lines expected to become operational in April to evacuate 2400 MW electricity from Thar coal-based plants.
NEPRA conducted a public hearing regarding the February monthly fuel charges adjustment of DISCOs, presided over by Nepra Chairman Taseef H Farooqui, and attended by other NEPRA members. CPPAG had submitted a request for an increase of 85 paisa per unit on account of fuel adjustment for the month of February 2023.
According to NEPRA, the reduction amounts to 0.0006 per unit based on a preliminary analysis of the data. However, the hike could go up to 85 paisa per unit if NTDC is able to satisfy the authority on the adjustment. The hike will be applicable for one month only and will apply to all customers of DISCOs except lifeline and electric vehicle charging stations. It will also not apply to K-Electric (KE) consumers. The authority will issue its detailed decision after further scrutiny of the data.
In the case of KE’s petition for fuel cost charge adjustment for February, a public hearing was also conducted at the Nepra headquarters. KE had submitted a request for an increase of Rs1.66 per unit under Fuel cost adjustment (FCA). According to Nepra’s data, the increase in FCA for February is from Rs0.56 to Rs1.7 per unit. The final figure will be notified later. It will be applicable for one month only and will apply to all KE customers except lifeline and electric vehicle charging stations. The authority will issue its detailed decision after further scrutiny of the data.
