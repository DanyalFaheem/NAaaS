0,"Colorectal cancer linked to dietary habits, lifestyle",Poor nutrition profiles and ultra-processed foods likely to increase cancer risk,"A seasoned health expert on Thursday highlighted the importance of creating awareness about a healthy diet and lifestyle to minimise the risk of developing colorectal cancer.
Dr Maaz Bin Badshah, a senior consultant, and gastroenterologist while speaking on the subject explained that colorectal cancer, also known as bowel cancer, often develops due to abnormal growth in the colon or rectum.
He also urged stakeholders to play their role in highlighting that the disease was entirely curable if diagnosed early. Early screening can play an important role in detecting the disease, he said, adding that people could lower the risk by increasing physical activity, avoiding tobacco, and incorporating fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains in their diet.
Screening should start earlier in individuals who have a history of colon cancer/polyps in the family or inflammatory blower disease, Dr Maaz said, adding, there were several screening options available and a physician could advise best about the most suitable screening test for an individual.
Poor nutrition profiles and ultra-processed foods which commonly contain food additives such as dietary emulsifiers and artificial sweeteners were the main cause behind the growth of this cancer, he mentioned. Replying to a question, he said every year, March was observed as Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month and this cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death in men and women.

1,‘Pakistan can earn carbon credits by curbing gas emissions’,FTO coordinator says green businesses can bring dollars on fast track,"The Coordinator to Federal Tax Ombudsman Meher Kashif Younis Thursday said Pakistan can earn carbon credits through the plantation, reforestation, various green covers, solar and wind power, controlling methane emissions from livestock and paddy fields and other activities that control Green House Gas (GHG) emissions.
Speaking at a workshop on “Pakistan And Greenhouse Gases” held under the aegis of Gold Ring Economic Forum, a strategic think tank, he said Carbon trading offers emerging and innovative trade and business opportunities to developing countries including Pakistan which can earn dollars for controlling greenhouse gas emissions.
He said in addition, all the hydro, biogas, plantation and other such green businesses can bring dollars on a very fast track, provided the focal ministry is proactive and willing to facilitate and support such strategic initiatives.
He said Pakistan has completed a carbon credit earning project and the government of Sindh has already earned carbon credits for the mangrove forests and got the first tranche of $14.75 million last year which may swell to $24-25 million in the next five years and this increase will continue for the 60-year pledge period.
Therefore, he said Pakistan is already enjoying the benefits of carbon credits from a forestry project and thus there is a great deal of scope and opportunities for earning carbon credits on a larger scale. He said this great success story can now easily be replicated in other forestry and GHG-controlling projects.
Further explaining its features Meher Kashif Younis said Pakistan’s collaboration with China’s carbon emission trading scheme from 2021 to 2025 also offers great opportunities.
He said under International Emissions Trading (IET), countries can trade in the international carbon credit market to cover their shortfall in the assigned amount of units.
He said farmers and landowners can sell carbon credits because land can store carbon. He said Landowners can sell carbon offsets on the voluntary carbon markets. He said these carbon credit buyers are purchasing carbon credits as an investment or are businesses trying to meet internal standards for carbon footprint reduction.

3,Consumers warned of app-based micro-credit risks,CCP initiates inquiry against nano-loan facility providers,"The Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) warns and cautions the general public about the rising trend of mobile app-based micro-credit and nano-loan facilities.
These applications, available on Google PlayStore and AppStore, offer short-term financing to borrowers but are currently facing numerous complaints and challenges in their track-and-trace process.
As a result, the CCP has initiated an inquiry against these applications, which are observed to constantly change their premises and/or companies/undertakings behind such applications.
Until the conclusion of the enquiry, the CCP deems it necessary to alert the general public about the many issues observed and how to avoid these issues. The CCP has also intimated SECP, FIA, and PTA in this regard.
Most of these applications operate without complying with Pakistan's regulatory framework. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the applications from which consumers are borrowing are duly registered and are operating under a regulatory regime. Moreover, these applications may tend to take complete control of the user's device by requiring the user to agree to standard access permissions for the app.
This may affect the privacy of the user as well as make the user vulnerable to the operator of such applications. Therefore, users are cautioned to carefully read the terms and conditions displayed so that they can make an informed decision.
When applying for a loan through these mobile app-based micro-credit and nano-loan facilities, users are presented with various terms and conditions that outline the period for which the loan is extended, the exact amount of loan disbursed, deductions made from the total loan requested, payment and repayment methods, and any hidden charges.
However, it has been observed that these terms and conditions are often at variance with what is advertised, resulting in deception or fraud. The applications also require the user to fill in two or more emergency contacts, which are considered collaterals/guarantors by the operators.
Recovery agents have reportedly been known to harass and abuse borrowers and their contacts for the sake of repayment.
The general public is made aware that these lenders will, on maturity, make calls to the consumer as well as the emergency contacts for recovery of the loan.
To avoid falling prey to fraudulent activities, the public needs to be aware that there have been instances where recovery agents have given their personal account details instead of the lender's valid account.

4,Police fail to trace out former Punjab CM’s aide,Zubair Khan’s son appeals to CJP to take suo moto notice,"The whereabouts of the former chairman of the Chief Minister Complaint Cell, Zubair Ahmed Khan, who went missing from the Gulnar Colony area of Race Course Police Station earlier this month, could not be traced even after the passing of 23 days.
The family of the former Punjab CM’s aide has appealed to the Chief Justice of Pakistan Justice Umar Ata Bandial to take suo moto notice on the issue for his safe recovery.
Zubair’s son Saad Zubair has adopted the stance in an application addressed to the CJP that his father was abducted by 12 unidentified persons when he was coming home from his office on the night of March 8.
“We searched him everywhere but his whereabouts are not being traced out. A case of his abduction was also registered in the Race Course Police Station while the Lahore High Court’s Rawalpindi Bench was also approached but to date, he has not been recovered,” the contents of the application read.
“It is the constitutional responsibility of the state to protect the life and property of its citizens. Their dignity, liberty and freedom of movement are protected under the Constitution,” the application argued.
Zubair’s son said that his father was a close associate of former Punjab CM Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi, alleging that the current government was targeting those who oppose its policies and were associated with the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) for reprisals through abductions and harassments.

5,IESCO transformers seized during raids,FIA books seven workshop owners for stealing precious copper coils and oil from transformers,"The Federal Investigation Authority (FIA) Islamabad conducted raids at four workshops in Islamabad and Taxila and recovered hundreds of transformers and other equipment of the Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO).
The FIA team led by Deputy Director Rana Shahid Habib conducted raids in both areas and recovered a large number of transformers, precious oil and copper coils and substandard silver coils, which were being installed in the IESCO transformers.
FIA officials said that valuable copper and oil were being stolen from IESCO transformers by the workshop owners. They said that valuable copper coils and oil of transformers were being replaced by substandard oil and silver coils.
The FIA team said that the workshop owners with the alleged connivance of IESCO officials and employees were doing all the murky business. They said that original IESCO transformers were also being sold in the market while faulty and second-hand transformers were being returned to the IESCO.

Interestingly, the IESCO spokesperson claimed that they send transformers to workshops under a proper procedure and with due permission of X-ENs, he was not sure whether the workshops, which were raided by the FIA, had the approval and NOCs to repair IESCO transformers. He said that the matter has been brought to the notice of the high-ups for further action.
The FIA officials said that substandard transformers with silver coils often malfunction, leading to line losses and trippings, causing millions of rupees in losses to the national exchequer.
The FIA team said that this malpractice and the sale of transformers and precious copper coils and oil were causing colossal losses to the IESCO and the government, which is struggling to cope with power shortages and load-shedding.
The FIA sources said that the workshop owners were also giving financial benefits to the IESCO officials. Separate cases have been registered against the four workshop owners and an investigation is under way.
FIA Deputy Director Rana Shahid Habib said that strict legal action will be taken against IESCO officials and workers for their alleged involvement in the heinous crime.
ISCO spokesman Raja Asim said that IESCO faulty transformers were sent to ‘approved’ workshops. He said that when a faulty transformer is sent for repair, a regular record is kept and an NOC is sought from the XEN of the sub-division concerned. He said that the matter has been brought to the notice of the IESCO chief executive.
He said that if ISCO officials or employees were found involved in the illegality, “strict action” will be taken against them.

6,Beggars swarm city markets,Residents urge authorities to take action,"With the onset of the fasting month, scores of professional beggars have thronged the garrison city from the surrounding areas to collect alms during the holy month of Ramazan – a time when Muslims give away the most in charity.
The menace has gone to the extent that the patience of residents is wearing thin and they are demanding of the authorities to rein in these supplicants who harass people at every nook and cranny of the city.
Professional beggars display physical deformities and in some cases, they emaciated babies among other tactics to gain the sympathies of the faithful who consider charity a must during Ramazan.
Families of beggars comprising males, females, young children, and the elderly make queues outside places of worship and shopping centres to collect alms.
One can find dozens of beggars gathered together at every major free iftar and sehri distribution point in the city. They remain in the business from dawn till dusk and sometimes till sehri in markets, streets, and even residential neighborhoods.
Despite a ban on begging, beggars can also be seen collecting alms at the doors of district courts.
On the other hand, the efforts of the police and authorities concerned have failed to bear good fruits.

7,Ancient Ramazan culture at risk of dying out,Culture of beating canisters to awaken citizens at sehri gradually declines,"The 150-year-old tradition of beating tin canisters to awaken the citizens for fasting at sehri time in the holy month of Ramazan has gradually died out.
It was common practice in the subcontinent during the British era to beat tin canisters by a group of people to wake people up for fasting before sunrise.
The culture persisted even after Pakistan was founded; however, this ancient and traditional system has now been replaced by social media including Facebook, Tik Tok, Instagram and other applications.
At present, only a few people are seen keeping the ancient tradition of beating the canisters through the streets alive. This ancient culture of Punjab continued for a century and a half. Later, the traditional drummers also joined it. In every Ramazan, these groups would beat the tin drums with wooden sticks in every season including summers, winters or even rains while shouting “People wake up, it's time for sehri” at the top of their voices, waking people with their loud voices to get ready for sehri.
There was no tradition of bringing sehri items from outside at that time as the meals were prepared at home. There used to be dozens of groups that used to wake up people at sehri. They would arrive in the streets of each area separately two and a half hours before sehri to awaken people.
In the last few years, this culture started to decline while this year it seems to be almost dead.
This year in the first five days of the holy month, only one middle-aged resident has been spotted walking the streets while carrying an empty tin canister around his neck and beating it with wooden sticks, however, he does not make a sound with his mouth to awaken the residents. Meanwhile, in many streets, he has been strictly prohibited from beating the canisters and making loud noises.
This person's name is Muhammad Abdullah. He is 52 years old. He told this reporter that he is a resident of Teli Mohalla. It was his family’s job to wake up the fasting people by beating the tin canisters at sehri time. His grandfather, father, uncle and elder brother had also been waking up the fasting people by beating up the canisters in the streets of Rawalpindi since 1950.
“Our entire family shared different areas,” he said and added that after performing their duties for a month, they would go in the streets early in the morning of Eidul Fitr and collect Eidi [remuneration] from each household for performing the job.

8,Alvi directs IIUI to give pension to teacher,President says employee cannot be deprived of ‘hard-earned right’ after rendering service for varsity,"President Dr Arif Alvi has upheld the order of the federal ombudsman (Wafaqi Mohtasib) directing the International Islamic University Islamabad (IIUI) to pay pension shares to a former professor, who had served the university for 14 years.
The president said that pension was a hard-earned right that accrued to an employee by dint of his long, continuous and faithful service, and the deprivation or delay in the grant of this right could not be permitted, except for under the law.
Dr Ali Asghar Chishti (the complainant) had served at IIUI from June 1985 to August 1999 as a faculty member before joining the Allama Iqbal Open University through the proper channel.
After he retired from AIOU in 2020, he requested the IIUI for the transfer of his pension shares but the same was denied despite the issuance of a letter of liability in his favour by the university.
Subsequently, he approached the Wafaqi Mohtasib (WM) for relief, who passed the order in his favour, as during the hearing, IIUI admitted his claim and assured him to redress his grievances. Later, the IIUI chose to file a representation with the president against the orders of WM.
The president upheld the order of Mohtasib, directing IIUI to transfer the pension share of the complainant. He stated that it was an admitted fact that pension was not a bounty but rather an employee earned it by dint of his long, continuous and faithful service. He added that the hard-earned right, that accrued to an employee, was like “property”, and constituted a fundamental right to livelihood under Article 9 of the Constitution of Pakistan. He stressed that the deprivation, even a part of this amount, could not be permitted, except for under the law.
The president also cited another SC judgment dated 21.02.2013, wherein government departments had been directed to not cause unnecessary hurdle or delay in finalizing the payment of pensionary/retirement benefits in the future.
In its judgment, the court had stated that any violation of these directions shall amount to criminal negligence and dereliction of duty, and if any delay in the finalization of pension benefits cases of government servants, widows or orphan children was brought to the notice of the Court, the head of the concerned department would also be held liable for the contempt of the Court and would be dealt with strictly per the law.
The president concluded that since IIUI had conceded the entitlement/claim of the complainant before the Wafaqi Mohtasib, therefore, it had no legal or moral justification to backtrack or seek reversal of the Mohtasib’s orders.
