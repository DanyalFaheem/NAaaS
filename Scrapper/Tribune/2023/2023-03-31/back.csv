0,‘March 30 order dictated in my absence’,Justice Miankhail says there is need to first resolve controversy surrounding SC’s March 1 order,"Citing reasons for his recusal from a bench that was hearing the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) plea against postponement of polls in Punjab, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail has said the order issued after Thursday’s hearing was dictated in his absence and without consulting him.
Justice Mainkhail on Friday recused himself from hearing the case, a day after the recusal of Justice Aminuddin Khan who was also a member of the five-judge bench formed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial to hear the PTI’s petition.
According to a two-page note issued by Justice Miankhail, he wanted to express his views when Justice Aminuddin decided to recuse himself from the case in view of the March 29 verdict of an SC bench which held that hearing of all suo motu cases be postponed till amendment is SC rules.
“However, the Hon’ble Chief Justice and other members of the bench rose, therefore, I was unable to do so. Subsequently, I remained in my chamber for a reasonable time, but received no information from the Hon’ble Chief Justice regarding further proceedings into the matter.
“When I reached home later the same day, I received an order dated 30.03.2023 from the Chief Justice for my signatures as a member of the bench,” he noted.
Reproducing the brief order which said that Justice Umar Ata Bandial, Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Munib Akhtar disagreed with the March 29 order of the SC bench, Justice Miankhail added that the order was dictated in his absence.
“Admittedly, the order was not dictated in open court, instead it was dictated in my absence and without contacting me for participation in the deliberations. I felt that the three learned members of the bench, for reasons best known to them, opted not to involve me in the consultation.”
He said the PTI’s petition was the outcome of the previous proceedings “which were dismissed by two honourable members of the bench –Justice Yahya Afridi and Justice Athar Minallah—through their respective short orders, followed by myself and Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah”.

“In this behalf, we issued our detailed reasons on 27.03.2023. Right from the first date of hearing of the present matter, I wanted this bench to resolve the controversy of the order dated 01.03.2023 and its Order of the Court, which has still not been issued till date, as it is of great significance to the present matter.
“No heed was paid to this issue, despite my raising it repeatedly. The learned Attorney-General, members of the legal fraternity, and learned counsel for the political parties also requested for resolution of this issue, but received no response from the other members of the bench.”
Justice Yahya Afridi on Friday also issued a 7-page detailed order citing reasons for dismissing three proceedings with regard to delay in announcement of polls in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“Firstly, the Intra-Court Appeals filed by the Governor of Punjab and the Election Commission of Pakistan against the judgment of the single bench [of the Lahore High Court] dated 10.02.2023 were pending before the Lahore High Court…
“The Peshawar High Court was also hearing a Constitutional Petition seeking similar relief for appointment of the date of election to the Provincial Assembly of the K-P;
“Secondly, the judgments of the pending proceedings before both the high courts could be challenged before this court under its appellate jurisdiction envisaged under Article 185 of the Constitution,” he added.

1,"All PIA pilots want to quit, claims CAA DG",Authority’s chief tells Senate panel 35% tax deducted from their salaries,"The director general of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) on Thursday told a Senate panel that all pilots of the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) wanted to leave the national carrier. Explaining the reason for this to the Senate Standing Committee on Aviation, CAA DG Khaqan Murtaza said around 35% tax was deducted from the salaries of the pilots.
He added that in addition to that, there was a tax imposed on flying hours of pilots too. “Most of the times you hear about flight cancellations, the reason for this is the dearth of pilots,” he continued. The meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Aviation was held at the Parliament House, presided over by its chairman, Senator Hidayatullah.
Senator Mohsin Aziz, a member of the panel, inquired whether PIA would ever turn profitable in their lifetimes.
PIA CEO Air Vice Marshal Muhammad Amir Hayat replied that the national carrier was making operational profit. Senator Aziz told him to inform the panel about the overall profit of the airline, and not just that of its operational. “Where does the loss of billions of rupees come from every year?” the senator questioned.
The PIA CEO then switched to the subject of pilots’ licences. He said there were 141 pilots with questionable licences. He added that 69 of them had been cleared.
The committee also discussed the matter of cancellation of License of PIA Pilots. The committee was briefed that 141 pilot licenses were declared as suspected by the PCAA, the breakup thereof along with status is 18 pilots were not PIA employees, 18 pilots were terminated from service upon suspension/cancellation of license by PCAA, 16 were deceased and separated, 2 Pilots are on stay order whose decision is pending due to the same and remaining 87 were cleared by PCAA afterwards. DG Civil Aviation apprised that the alleged pilot was involved in irregularities and obtained the APTL licenses by unfair means. The chairman committee directed to constitute a subcommittee to probe the matter in detail.

3,"Like 1997, PML-N again ‘threatening’ CJP: Imran",PTI chief says those who are in power hell-bent on avoiding electoral defeat,"Former prime minister and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan has said that the ruling Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) is “threatening” the chief justice of Pakistan in the same way it “attacked” the top court in 1997.
“As the PML-N did in 1997 by storming SC to attack [the then] CJ Sajjad Ali Shah hearing a contempt petition against Nawaz Sharif, today the PML-N is again threatening the SC and the CJP because they are petrified of elections,” he said in a tweet on Friday.
His statement came after the Supreme Court on Friday rejected a request by Attorney General Pakistan Mansoor Awan for the formation of a full court bench as it continued hearing the PTI petition against delay in elections of the Punjab Assembly.
CJP Umar Ata Bandial said that neither the law nor rules talked about the composition of a full court, adding that they would not “go back” to the start as the matter was being heard since Monday.
The hearing continued after two judges – Justice Aminuddin Khan and Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail – recused themselves from the five-member bench.
Addressing the common citizen in his tweets, the PTI chairman urged the people to come out in protest for the sake of democracy and the rule of law in the country.
“I want people of Pakistan to be ready to come out on streets if need be to save Rule of Law, the Constitution and democracy. We will be talking to all those political parties who are prepared to stand up against this conspiracy,” the PTI chief said.
He also appealed to the lawyers’ community to again “take the lead as they did in 2007 lawyers’ movement to protect Pakistan's Constitution and the rule of law”.
Separately in an interview with Times Radio, Imran linked the “threat” to his life and the recent crackdown on his party to his “unprecedented popularity”, claiming that those who were in power were hell-bent on avoiding electoral defeat.
The PTI chief said that he faced a threat to his life which had been confirmed by public statement made by Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah himself.
But while the government suspected the threat to be from ""some foreign elements"", the PTI chief said he ""knows that it is from the government itself"".
""There were three main people in the government that I believe were responsible for my assassination and I predicted that about six weeks before the attempt took place. They are still sitting in government, they are sabotaging the inquiry report because it was implicating them and I think that they are more threatened than ever,"" he said.
""There was an intelligence agency general who was involved in this, I nominated him, the interior minister -- who recently gave a statement that it is either us or them or some stupid statement like that -- and then of course the prime minister. All of them have been involved in extra-judicial killings and there is a record about that,"" he added.

4,"Govt keeps petrol, diesel prices unchanged","Reduces prices of kerosene oil, light diesel oil by Rs10 per litre","The government on Friday kept prices of diesel and petrol unchanged effective from April 1, 2023 despite a dip in rates in the international market.
However, it reduced the prices of kerosene oil and light diesel oil by Rs10 per litre each.
The Government has decided to keep the existing prices of MS(Petrol) and High Speed Diesel unchanged and decrease Rs.10/- in the prices of Kerosene Oil and Light Diesel Oil, from 1st April,2023 to 15th April, 2023. pic.twitter.com/wjPUZJVfOb
The price of high speed diesel (HSD) was expected to witness a decline of Rs14.31 per litre.
Diesel is widely used in transport and agriculture sectors. The reduction in its price could have brought inflationary impact down and a relief for farmers as the crop-sowing season had kicked off.
However, the government maintained its existing price of Rs293 per litre for the next fortnight effective from April 1, 2023.
Meanwhile, the oil industry was expecting a reduction of Rs3.51 per litre in the price of petrol.

Petrol is an alternative to the compressed natural gas (CNG), especially in Punjab where CNG outlets rely on imported gas. However, in the recent winter, LNG was not made available to them.
The government also maintained its price at Rs272 per litre.
The consumers were already facing high prices, especially the low-income group, who had motorbikes and small cars.
With a fresh reduction of Rs10 per litre, the price of kerosene oil came down to Rs180.29 per litre against the earlier price of Rs190.29 per litre.
Kerosene oil is an important household fuel because of its use for cooking and heating purposes in remote areas.
Pakistan Army is also its key user in the northern part of Pakistan.
In 13 days, the US dollar appreciated by Rs4.66 against the rupee.
The light diesel oil is used in industry. The government cut its price by Rs10 from Rs184.68 per litre to Rs 174.68 per litre.

On Wednesday, a district and sessions court had issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for the April 18 hearing, while rejecting Imran’s request for an exemption from appearance in the case pertaining to the intimidation of a female judge.
Imran had challenged the decision to issue an arrest warrant and filed an appeal.

6,Sojourn in hell,HRW report paints a bleak picture of Pakistani prisons and their healthcare facilities,"Jail authorities in Pakistan have systematically deprived prisoners of adequate healthcare facilities, leaving thousands at the risk of disease and death, says a 55-page report recently released by the Human Rights Watch (HRW).
Titled as “A Nightmare for Everyone: The Health Care Crisis in Pakistan’s Prisons,” the report brings to light the dilapidated condition of the prison healthcare system in Pakistan.
According to the report, Pakistani jails with a population of over 88,000 inmates are among the most overcrowded jails in the world with cells meant for three prisoners often holding up to 15 prisoners.
It said severe overcrowding has compounded existing health deficiencies in prisons, leaving inmates vulnerable to communicable diseases and unable to access medicine and treatment for even basic health needs. Apart from being overcrowded, they also lack sufficient healthcare facilities.
""The number of designated posts for medical officers for all prisons in Pakistan was 193, but as of 2020, 105 of these posts were vacant. Moreover, only Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) province had approved two posts for dentists and even those were vacant.
“Similarly, there were 106 approved posts for psychologists in Punjab and Balochistan, but none in Sindh and the K-P; but 62 of these were vacant. Punjab’s 41 prisons had only 42 doctors, 6 medical labs and 30 ambulances; the K-P’s 20 prisons had only 17 doctors, 7 medical labs and 6 ambulances.”
It said Balochistan’s 11 prisons had only 9 doctors, 2 labs and 4 ambulances; and Sindh’s 24 prisons had only 17 doctors and 5 labs while the number for ambulances in prisons of Sindh could not be confirmed.
The study also quoted a 2015 report by the Federal Ombudsman of Pakistan.
According to the ombudsman report the Central Jail Rawalpindi, with an inmate population of 4,748, had a 55-bed hospital with an electrocardiogram (ECG), ultrasound, X-ray and clinical lab facilities but lacked sufficient toilets and medical staff.
“Out of 709 positions [for medical professionals], 193 were vacant, including the positions for a women medical officer, nursing assistant, dispensers, X-ray machine attendant and female dispenser.”
The report found that the clinic, dispensary and mini lab at Quetta district jail were operated by one doctor. All serious cases were sent to the nearby civil hospital by the jail’s ambulance. The jail had 800 to 900 inmates.
The central jail in Haripur, with a population of 1,772 inmates, had a 40-bed hospital managed by two medical officers. This hospital lacked an ECG machine, suction machine, X-ray films, oxygen cylinders, hepatitis diagnostic kits, enteric fever/typhoid diagnostic tests, and basic medicines like hydrating salts.
The study observed that when an orthopedic surgeon from the district hospital was called on to examine the prisoners, most of them were found to be suffering from osteoporosis due to prolonged confinement and lack of opportunities for physical exercise.
""A 2014 report by the nongovernmental Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), based on inspection of 12 prisons of different types across the four provinces, found that the jail hospitals and dispensaries left much to be desired.”
It said none of the 12 jails had sufficient amount or variety of medication. The dispensaries were critically understaffed and ill-equipped with as few as 3 beds for a prison population of 300.
“The in-house doctors put the number of patients visiting each day in central prisons at 100 but the supply of medication was severely lacking. Prisoners complained of long waiting lists and inferior quality of medication,"" it said.

7,Agreed in 2018 next polls will be held as per new census: Azam,"Dar tells Senate if elections conducted now, they will be on basis of old constituencies","The Senate on Thursday was informed that it was decided in 2018 that the next general elections would be held on the basis of a fresh census.
During the Question Hour in the upper house of parliament, Federal Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar also told the House that the country’s first digital population census was under way in addition to counting the number of households as well.
He was responding to a question raised by PPP Senator Bahramand Tangi, who asked how the elections would take place if the census was not completed.
He also inquired whether the elections would be held based on the figures of the previous census or the ongoing one.
Presently, the 7th Population and Housing Census is ongoing in the country.
The law minister told the PPP senator that along with the agreement for the next polls to be held in accordance with the new census, around 25 or 26 amendments were passed as well.
Azam continued that if the census as well as the fresh delimitation of constituencies were completed, then the general elections would be held in accordance with the new enumeration.
Expressing his views in the House, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar noted that if the elections were conducted now, they would be held on the basis of the previous delimitation of constituencies.
Referring to Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, he wondered if governments were formed in the two provinces now, would the elections conducted in October this year be fair and transparent.
The finance minister further maintained that a similar amount of funds were spent on the census conducted in 2017 and reservations were raised over that as well.
He added that there were calls for introducing amendments to that census too and they were eventually incorporated.
He pointed out that the elections in Punjab and K-P would then be conducted on the basis of the previous census.
The minister added that as amendments were introduced in the 2017 census, there was no problem in making changes in the ongoing one too.
Speaking on other matters, Dar claimed that the current government had not stopped its external payments even for a day.
He added that now that the country’s external debt had reduced, the government was focusing on improving its foreign reserves.
“We are striving to take the central bank’s reserves by the end of this year to $13 billion,” he maintained.
The minister said there should be no politics on the country’s economy.
He added that the government had already said it was prepared to hold talks with the opposition on a ""charter of economy"".
Dar regretted that the State Bank of Pakistan had been turned into a state within a state, adding that his ministry had nothing to do with the monetary policy.
Returning to the issue of census, MQM-P Senator Faisal Subzwari demanded that the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) should be taken on board the process.
He added that the census did not only mean parliament seats, but involved the distribution of resources as well.
Subzwari noted that the census figures were not classified documents that they were not being disclosed.
He continued that all parties should be heard to make the process of census a transparent one.
He maintained that nobody would accept a “controversial” census.
The MQM-P senator added what was the use of spending billions of rupees on a “controversial” activity.
PTI Senator Faisal Javed raised the question why the economy was performing well 10 months ago.
“Who destroyed an economy that was running so well?” he asked.
In response, Finance Minister Dar challenged the PTI senator to a verbal duel on the economy.
The minister sarcastically remarked that the PTI senator’s suggestion of a comparison between the state of economy during his party’s tenure and the one of the incumbent government was “good” one.
The minister asked the Senate chairman to set a day during the session in the coming week for the verbal duel.
During the sitting, the commerce ministry presented its written trade figures.
Commerce Minister Naveed Qamar disclosed that the country’s exports might decline instead of increasing. He added that there was a massive loss in exports to China.
As per the written trade figures, the country's exports stood at $21.40 billion in the year 2019-2020. In the financial year 2020-21, there were exports of $25.30 billion.
The country’s exports stood at $31.80 billion In the fiscal year 2021-22. In the year 2019-2020, the textile exports were recorded at $12.50 billion.
In the financial year 2020-21, there were textile exports worth $15.40 billion. The textile exports registered more than $19 billion in the financial year 2021-22.
Under the free trade agreement between Pakistan and China, Islamabad exported goods costing more than $2.4 billion dollars to Beijing in 2022-21.

9,Judges vacant posts blamed for pending cases,Awan stressed that judges should be appointed on vacant posts in the courts,"The Ministry of Law has presented the details of last five years’ pending cases in the Supreme Court and high courts in the National Assembly.
Minister of State for Law Shahadat Awan termed the vacant posts of judges as the reason for the large number of pending cases, saying the judiciary was responsible to make the appointments.
According to the documents, more than 380,000 cases are pending before the apex court and high courts.
At least 51,744 cases are pending before the top court whereas in Lahore High Court (LHC) 179,425 cases; Sindh High Court (SHC) 85,781 cases; Peshawar High Court (PHC) 41,911 cases; Islamabad High Court (IHC) 17,104 cases and in Balochistan High Court (BHC) 4,471 cases are pending.
Awan said there were three vacant posts of judges in the Supreme Court and 16 in the LHC. In SHC, 11 posts of judges are vacant whereas two each are vacant in BHC and IHC.
He noted that parliament was supreme and people pinned their hopes in it. He said parliament will have to look into the matter if an institution does not work, adding that it will have to legislate on it.
He said the “supervision control” of court rests with the judiciary and noted that judiciary had been given a “separate identity” in the Constitution.
Awan stressed that judges should be appointed on vacant posts in the courts.
National Assembly Speaker Raja Pervez Ashraf also expressed his concern over the large number of pending cases and questioned who was responsible if judges were not being appointed to the courts.
Awan responded that judiciary appointed the judges, adding that the law ministry was only responsible for issuing its notification.
Expressing his view point, he said seniority was considered for promotion in every department, emphasising that laws for the appointment of judges needed to be changed.
