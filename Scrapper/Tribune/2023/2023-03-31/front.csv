0,"LHC bars Punjab from handing over 45,000 acres to army",Court issued notices to respondents for May 9,"The Lahore High Court has refrained the caretaker Punjab government from handing over around 45,267 acres in three districts of the province — Bhakkar, Khushab, and Sahiwal — to the Pakistan Army for “Corporate Agriculture Farming”.
A notification issued by the GHQ Land Directorate on March 10 read that 45,267 acres of farm land had been handed over to the Pakistan Army in different districts of Punjab.
The GHQ Land Directorate wrote to the Punjab chief secretary, Board of Revenue and agriculture, forest, livestock and irrigation departments secretaries for handing over of 42,724 acres in Kaloor Kot and Mankera tehsils in Bhakkar, 1,818 acres in Quaidabad and Khushab tehsils in Khushab, and 725 acres in Chichawatni tehsil of Sahiwal.
The letter referred to a notification of the Punjab government dated February 20, 2023, and a joint venture agreement signed on March 8.

Following this development, the caretaker set-up in Punjab immediately signed a pact with the army to hand over the land it had mentioned in its letter to it.
On Thursday, LHC judge Abid Hussain Chattha issued a two-page verdict, stopping the province's caretaker government from extending any “lease of state land” for this purpose.
The judgment was issued over a plea filed by Ahmad Rafay Alam on behalf of the Public Interest Law Association of Pakistan on March 28.
The LHC issued notices to the respondents for May 9, seeking their response on the matter.
The court observed that the points raised by the petitioner needed consideration.
The judge also sent notices to the attorney general for Pakistan and Punjab advocate general.
The verdict read that the petitioners had argued that under Section 230 of the Election Act, 2017, the mandate and scope of the caretaker government was limited to perform day-to-day functions and it was specifically barred to make policy decisions of a permanent nature.
“The impugned notification which as per clause 9 thereof allows grant of state land for a period of thirty years, is a decision of a permanent nature which could not have been taken by the caretaker government,” it added.

The verdict further stated that in addition, the counsel had also referred to a letter dated March 10, 2023, written by the director general of strategic projects, Pakistan Army to the functionaries of the Punjab government seeking handing over of State land for 'corporate agriculture farming'.
“[The petitioner] contends that constitutional mandate restricts [the] army to perform functions of external and internal security and does not extend to Corporate Agriculture Farming,” it added.

1,Nawaz rejects three judge SC bench,Deposed premier says his party will not accept decision of existing bench in rare press conference,"Muslim League-Nawaz’s (PML-N) supreme leader Nawaz Sharif has demanded formation of a full court to hear the petition filed against postponement of polls in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) provinces, warning that his party will not accept the decision of the existing bench.
“Everyone agrees that a full court should be formed to hear the election case as it is not a petty matter involving a truck or wheelbarrow but a national issue,” said Nawaz, who has been living in London in self-imposed exile since November 2019, in a rare interaction with a group of journalists on Friday.
“[I suggest that unilateral] decisions should not be imposed on us. How can we accept the decision of the bench when we don’t accept the bench itself,” the deposed premier said in a reference to the three-judge bench comprising Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial, Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Munib Akhtar.
The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the Election Commission of Pakistan’s March 22 notification, announcing postponement of elections in Punjab, earlier scheduled for April 30.
A five-judge bench of the Supreme Court, led by CJP Bandial, was formed to hear the PTI’s petition.
The PML-N led federal government had demanded formation of a full court to decide the matter while some key leaders of the ruling party had openly criticized some senior judges including the CJP.
The government also hurriedly drafted the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure), Bill 2023, a piece of proposed legislation that aimed at curbing the top judge’s suo motu powers. The bill sailed through both the National Assembly and the Senate respectively on March 29 and March 30.
On Wednesday—March 29—an SC bench led by Justice Qazi Faez Isa held that all cases that various Supreme Court benches were hearing under Article 184 (3) of the Constitution be postponed until amendments are made in the Supreme Court Rules 1980 regarding the discretionary powers of the CJP.
On March 30, when the five-judge bench resumed hearing of the polls postponement case Justice Aminuddin Khan—who had endorsed Justice’s Isa’s ruling—announced that he wanted to recuse himself. Another member of the bench, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, followed suit.
CJP Bandial, however, once again rejected the government’s request on Friday to form a full court.
Nawaz said the decision of a full court would be acceptable for all including the PML-N.  “But it is said that now a three-judge bench will decide the matter. The people must understand the joke being played on them,” he added.
The former premier also lambasted some former judges including Justice (retd) Saqib Nisar, asking them to tell the nation why they disqualified him in 2017. A five-judge bench of the apex court on July 27, 2017 disqualified Nawaz Sharif for life for hiding his salary in his 2013 nomination papers.
The former premier claimed that the verdicts of such benches had Pakistan put on the verge of destruction. “Even today they want to impose their decision on the people but we will not let anyone push the country into chaos.”
Nawaz asked why the apex court did not take suo motu notice of the revelation made by former army chief General (retd) Qamar Javed Bajwa and the injustice meted out to Islamabad High Court former judge Shaukat Aziz Saddiqui and him.
“[Supreme Court judge] Justice Mazahar Ali Abkar Naqvi is a fit case for accountability, which should be taken up by the Supreme Judicial Council,” he added.
Meanwhile, PML-N Senior Vice President Maryam Nawaz once again aimed her guns at Justice Bandial, claiming that the chief justice had lost trust of his fellow judges and his verdicts now had no legal or moral authority.
In a tweet, Maryam said she shared Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail’s prayers for divine mercy on the apex court. “It is the responsibility of the entire nation to prevent the ‘house of justice’ from becoming the ‘house of PTI’ on behalf of a few facilitators. A one-man show will lead to disaster,” she wrote.
Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah also urged CJP Bandial not to ""push the country into anarchy"", asking him to constitute a full court bench to hear the case about postponement of polls.
Speaking to reporters outside the apex court, the interior minister said that the bench, which originally comprised nine members, had dwindled down to seven, then five, and subsequently to four with yet another judge recently stepping down.
Sanaullah stressed that it was imperative for the chief justice to ensure that justice is served. He urged him to constitute a full bench in the case, saying that failure to do so would result in the country falling into ""chaos and anarchy"".

2,CJ snubs AGP's request for full court,Bench reconstituted after Justice Mandokhail recuses himself from hearing poll delay case,"The Supreme Court on Friday rejected a request by Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Awan for the formation of a full court as it continued hearing the PTI's petition against the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) delay in the Punjab Assembly polls.
Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial observed that neither the law nor rules mentioned the composition of a full court and the SC would not return to the start as the matter was being heard since Monday.
The hearing of the case continued after two judges -- Justice Aminuddin Khan and Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail -- recused themselves from the five-member bench.
On Friday, a three-member bench led by CJP Bandial, resumed the hearing of the matter with Hassan Raza Pasha, the chairperson of the Pakistan Bar Council’s (PBC) Executive Council, present before the apex court.
The top judge maintained that the PBC office-holder would be heard later.
To This, Pasha said the bar had nothing to do with supporting anyone.
He suggested that the SC should hold a full-court session.
That was in case a full-court bench could not be formed, he added.
The CJP noted that the bench was considering taking that measure, adding that the relationship between the judges was “good”.
Pasha, however, pointed out that on Thursday and Friday, two judges had recused themselves from hearing the matter.
The CJP told Pasha to meet him in his chambers on that issue.
“Today is the first time you have come to the court, prove yourself by actions, not by words,” Justice Bandial advised, reinviting Pasha to his chambers.
He added that the president of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) had been in touch with him.
“Our lives would have been peaceful if it was only about the external image.
Media personnel also sometimes report ‘wrong things',” the chief justice noted, insisting that the court had always showed restraint.
Justice Bandial maintained that he would conduct some meetings after the hearing and hoped that “Monday’s sun would rise with good news”.
The chief justice observed that the AGP could raise whatever point he wanted to.
To this, the AGP requested the court to ""lower the rising temperatures across the country"" -- signalling to the turmoil rising from the disagreement within the court itself.
When asked by the CJP what the AGP had done to lower the temperatures, he replied that ""temperatures might reduce over time"".
Justice Bandial maintained that the court had always given precedence to the Constitution.
“[The] Constitution is very important for us; for this nation; for this society; it holds the federation together; it keeps alive democracy,” he noted.
“Today when you go to parliament, you find people addressing the [House] who were till yesterday in captivity, imprisoned, declared traitors; they are now talking over there, and being respected; because they are representatives of the people,” he added.
Commenting on the case, the CJP observed that the 90-day deadline for holding the Punjab Assembly polls as per the Constitution expired in April.
The chief justice continued that the president was supposed to give the date 15 days after the stipulated 90-day period.
He added that the ECP had not informed the president about the security situation and the problems associated with holding the polls on April 30.
“If the president had been informed about the situation, the date of April 30 might not have been suggested,” he continued.
The top judge noted that the matter of holding the elections on October 8 was brought before the court, which did not want to create more problems.
The CJP directed the parties to give a solid reasoning or initiate a dialogue.
“The term of the assemblies will also be completed in August. If there are negotiations between the government and opposition, a break will be taken for a few days. However, if negotiations do not take place, constitutional roles will be played,” he added.
Justice Bandial observed that if a dialogue took place, the points of all participating sides would be mentioned in the judgment.
He also inquired about the expenses of Rs20 billion to hold separate elections and the security issue with half the polling stations categorised as “highly sensitive”.
Referring to the reason given earlier which highlighted terrorism in the country, Justice Bandial observed that such elements were present since the 90s.
He added that the court was told that the forces were busy at the borders and that the matter would also have to be looked into.
The AGP highlighted that the court would have to observe the circular issued by the CJP and read the note of Justice Mandokhail after he left the bench.
He added that the second matter was the ratio of the judgment of March 1, as well as the order issued on that day as the current petition was based on that.
“Two members of the nine-judge bench recused themselves from the bench voluntarily,” the AGP said.
On the CJP’s inquiry, the AGP read out the court order dated February 27 where the matter was referred to the top judge for the reconstitution of the bench.
The AGP maintained that the CJP had stated that the judges had not recused themselves from hearing the case.
To this, Justice Bandial replied that he had not mentioned anything in that connection.
The CJP observed that the judges would discuss the order and told the AGP to focus on “lowering the temperatures”.
“We cannot even respond to criticism. The internal discussions of judges should not be in public,” he noted, adding that the matters would be resolved soon.
The AGP argued that on the first day, a request was made to form a full court, to which the CJP responded that reasoning must be given for that notion.
He added that the top judge had claimed that the matter of forming a full court was already on his mind.
The CJP replied that there was a lot to keep in mind while creating a judicial bench -- one thing among them was that routine cases were not affected.
In the present era, he added that the number of cases disposed of daily was increasing.
“Sometimes all judges are not available,” the CJP noted, pointing out that last week there were benches in Quetta, Karachi and Lahore.
He added that there was a bench in Lahore this week as well.
He maintained that all judges were considered while forming a nine-member bench and listed judges, who were experts of the Constitution.
The chief justice also highlighted that Justice Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi was added to the bench to send a silent message.
The top judge noted that Justice Qazi Faez Isa’s case went on for two years and the court was punished.
“For Justice Isa, the case was a punishment. There is a political case based on which other judges were targeted,” he noted.
The CJP added that all judges were being targeted on hearsay.
He continued that the SC was unified in some cases and no one saw how the judiciary was being affected.
He maintained that nobody saw how people in important positions were targeting the judiciary.
“I am being asked to punish another judge. Go and examine the evidence first,” he observed, maintaining that the apex court had the best judges in two decades.
“If you talk about law, I will listen as a judge, [but] if you talk about my judges, you will have to face me,” the chief justice noted, adding that he had a heart and feelings too.
He maintained that whatever he did was done honestly with the Almighty as his witness.
The top judge added that whatever was carried out was done in accordance with law.
The AGP said he would conclude his arguments quickly and the CJP instructed him to talk about the case, including matters pertaining to finances and funds.
AGP Awan said the SC should listen to political parties first and he would inform the court at a later time about the financial situation.
The CJP noted that Farooq H Naik, Akram Shaikh and Kamran Murtaza would also be heard, but he wanted to hear the State of Pakistan first.
Justice Muneeb Akhtar asked the AGP if the elections could be delayed till October 8.
The AGP replied that the matter was not about Rs20 billion, it pertained to the entire economy.
“The country is facing a deficit of Rs1.5 trillion, and by June 30, the interest rate can go up to 22%. The rising interest rates increase debt,” the AGP added.
The CJP inquired if the new rate of interest applied to past loans.
Justice Akhtar questioned how much money did the government have in the treasury presently.
He further asked how much money was there in federal consolidated funds.
“If [a sum of] Rs20 billion is spent, how much will the deficit increase,” the judge inquired.
He added that the election expenses were probably less than 1% of the deficit.
The AGP replied that Rs170 billion was expected in the supplementary budget, if the whole sum was collected.
Awan further informed the court that the funds were under the control of the finance ministry.
Justice Akhtar asked Awan to read the rules of 2019 and inform the court about who controls the funds.
The judge further asked the AGP to review the rules under the Public Financial Management Act.
He added that according to the rules, the consolidated funds were in the State Bank.
The judge instructed the AGP to call the central bank and ask how much money it had.
“The Election Commission is looking at the government. The commission says that if the funds are available, the elections will be held on April 30,” he added.
The CJP contended that having funds and their availability for spending them were two different things.
He added that the central bank had to keep money and gold reserves.
Subsequently, the apex court rejected the AGP's plea to form a full court for the time being.
Justice Akhtar expressed his displeasure over the AGP’s request and termed it “forum shopping”.
The three-judge bench summoned the defence and finance secretaries to provide assistance with holding elections for the two provincial assemblies.
The hearing of the case was adjourned till Monday.
Earlier in the day, the bench hearing the PTI plea was disbanded again after Justice Mandokhail recused himself from hearing it.
Before that, Justice Khan had recused himself from hearing the plea too, giving the reason that he was a signatory to an order issued by a different bench.
He had proposed the postponement of all cases instituted under Article 184(3) of the Constitution.
However, earlier in the day, a new four-judge bench was formed excluding Justice Khan.
Justice Mandokhail noted that Thursday's order, which stated that the remaining SC bench disagreed with Justice Khan and considered that the hearing as well as proceedings in the petition remained unaffected -- was passed without his consultation.
Therefore, he added that he was a “misfit” on the bench.
In a handwritten note, Justice Mandokhail stated: “The order was not dictated in the court, nor was I consulted by the honourable chief justice. However [the] impact of the judgment requires consideration in court.”
CJP Bandial then observed that the SC would shortly pass an order about the composition of a new bench.
In a related development, the CJP exercised his administrative powers and disregarded the judicial order issued by Justice Isa and Justice Khan, stating that it violated the rules laid down by a five-judge larger bench.
On March 29, an SC bench held that all cases that various top court benches were hearing under Article 184(3) of the Constitution be postponed until amendments were made to the Supreme Court Rules, 1980 about the discretionary powers of the CJP.
A three-judge bench, led by Justice Isa and comprising Justice Khan and Justice Shahid Waheed, issued the verdict with a vote of 2 to 1.
The judgment carried the dissenting note by Justice Waheed.
A day earlier, when the five-judge bench resumed hearing the polls postponement case, Justice Khan --who had endorsed Justice Isa’s ruling on Wednesday -- announced that he wanted to recuse himself from hearing the case.
In connection with the order passed by Justice Isa, the chief justice issued a circular stating that the observations made in paras 11 to 22 and 26 to 28 of the majority judgement of two to one travel beyond the list before the court and invoked its suo motu jurisdiction.
The circular continued that the “unilateral assumption of a judicial power in such a manner violates the rule laid down by a five-member judgment of this court reported as enforcement of fundamental rights with regard to independence of press/media”.
“Such power is to be invoked by the chief justice on the recommendation of an honourable judge or learned bench of the Court based on the criteria laid down in Article 184(3) of the Constitution,” it read.
It continued that Article 184(3) of the Constitution gave the Supreme Court the extraordinary power to assume jurisdiction over any “question of public importance with reference to the enforcement of any fundamental rights”.
“The said majority judgment, therefore, disregards binding law laid down by a larger bench of the court,” the circular added.
“Any observation made in the said judgment, inter alia, for the fixation or otherwise of cases is to be disregarded,” it concluded.
The circular was issued by the SC Registrar stating the “foregoing legal position for the information of all concerned”.
The circular was issued shortly after the Senate passed the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure), Bill 2023 -- aimed at curbing the top judge’s suo motu powers in an individual capacity amid protest by the opposition.
A total of 60 votes were cast in favour of the bill and 19 against it. Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar submitted a motion to present the bill in the House, presided over by its chairman, Sadiq Sanjrani.
The opposition’s motion to hand over the bill to the standing committee was rejected.
However, a motion to pass it was approved immediately.

3,12 killed in stampede at Zakat distribution point,Police arrest 7 employees of factory in Karachi; owner out of country to perform Umrah,"At least 12 people, including three children, were killed in a stampede during the distribution of Zakat at a private company at Norris Chowrangi, Sindh Industrial and Trading Estate (SITE) area.
According to preliminary details, women also died when they fell into the drain due to the stampede, while many other people were reported to be injured. The dead and injured were shifted to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital.
According to an Edhi Foundation volunteer, a stampede occurred due to the falling of a power line during the ration distribution, but the claim was later denied.
According to eyewitnesses, many people also fainted due to the stampede.
The police said 12 people died in the accident while five others were injured, of which three were in serious condition. “Women and children are also among the dead and injured.”
According to Baldia Town superintendent of police, the company did not inform about the ration distribution beforehand. “The water line leaked during the stampede, in which the electric wire fell, which caused the deaths.”
He said the police had detained seven people of the company and shifted them to the police station.
Keamari Senior Superintendent of Police Fida Hussain Janwari said that more than 400 people were present at the factory when a fire broke out. “The management also did not find any evidence of death due to electrocution. The deaths occurred due to suffocation.”
Keamari Deputy Commissioner Mukhtiar Ali Abro told the media at the scene that such sad incidents had happened before. The dyeing factory management was distributing ration and cash to the people, eh said, adding that before organising such a programme, it was necessary to inform and take permission from the police and district administration.
He said that the factory management did not give any information beforehand, which was against the law. “The owner of the factory has gone to perform Umrah. We will conduct further investigation when he returns, while seven people, including employees, have been arrested from the factory.”
The deputy commissioner said that the factory had been sealed immediately.
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah took notice of the tragic incident, seeking a report from the Karachi commissioner.
The chief minister announced financial assistance of Rs500,000 for each family of the victim.
Murad also announced Rs100,000 financial assistance for each injured person.
He directed the chief secretary to obtain the information of the deceased and injured immediately through the district administration.
“As soon as the data is collected, the relief money will be distributed among the victims.”
Murad said in a statement that the administration should report regularly for the distribution of ration and welfare work. “The report of the death of 12 people is very painful.”
The chief minister directed that the injured be shifted to a hospital immediately, saying: “I am saddened to hear that women were among the martyrs.”
Provincial Information Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said that a tragic incident took place during the distribution of ration outside a private factory in Site Area, in which precious lives of children and women were lost due to a stampede.
He said, “The factory management did not give any information to the police and the district administration regarding the distribution of ration nor did they take permission.”
He said that an FIR was registered against the factory owners and seven persons had been arrested.
The provincial minister said that everyone wanted to do good deeds in the blessed month of Ramazan, appealing to philanthropists and non-governmental organisations to inform the district administration and police while doing good deeds so that they could be provided with adequate security.
He said that keeping in mind the sad incidents that happened in Punjab during the distribution of flour throughout Pakistan, the Sindh government decided to transfer the funds for the purchase of flour to the deserving families under the Benazir Income Support Programme so that such incidents did not happen.

4,Top court’s 1997 recurrence feared,"After happenings in the last couple of days, crisis in the Supreme Court is deepening with each passing day","After happenings in the last couple of days, crisis in the Supreme Court is deepening with each passing day as comparisons are being drawn between the present state of affairs with the events that took place in the apex court in 1997, when the judges were passing judicial orders against each other and finally the then Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah was compelled to resign.
Former additional attorney general Tariq Mahmood Khokhar feared a historic recurrence.
""In 1997, a CJP was isolated and devoured by the concerted efforts of the government, the extra constitutionalists and a majority of brother judges. Then as now, a sympathetic president was of no help. The script seems familiar but there are crucial differences as more vocal lawyers, civil society, social media, Pakistani diaspora and a popular political party are gaining momentum for the CJP. Delayed elections will embolden them further,"" he added.
Senior lawyers appreciated CJP Bandial’s determination of holding the general elections under the Constitution.

However, they believed that his legacy would not be good if the Supreme Court remained divided in the current manner.
However, a lawyer belonging to the ruling Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) believed that there was no comparison between the present situation with that of 1997 during former CJP Sajjad’s tenure, wherein two separate cause lists were being issued.
He said that presently, no judge wrote so far against the CJP's power that formation of benches was violative of the Constitution. However, they were questioning that the CJP’s power should be used in a manner wherein transparency was ensured.
Even the judges, who held that the CJP was a master of roster, observed that there was imbalance in exercising of suo motu jurisdiction which ought to be addressed.
The PML-N lawyer said that differences among judges started much before the incumbent government came to power.
He said that a clash had started during former chief justice Saqib Nisar’s era but that was not visible except one incident that happened at the Peshawar Registry.
He believed that the present division was between remains of Nisar and a victim of the former CJP era.
He, however, criticised the party leadership for facilitating CJP Umar Ata Bandial by approving his nomination for elevation to the Supreme Court.
Currently, the Supreme Court was visibly divided into two groups.
Read Govt hatching conspiracy to divide judiciary: Imran
It was being witnessed that except one, judges who were being elevated against the seniority principle, were standing on one side while high courts’ chief justices except two, who were elevated on the basis of seniority principle, were standing on the other.
CJP Bandial, who “is known as a balancing judge”, was facing questions from his fellow judges on account of exercising discretionary powers to form benches and fix cases.
After one month of his taking charge as the CJP, Justice Qazi Faez Isa had written a letter to Justice Bandial complaining that no senior-most judge was consulted while constituting the bench to hear the cases, on which the eyes of the entire nation were set, adding that this was troubling because it could potentially give rise to unnecessary and avoidable misgivings.
Justice Isa had also raised serious questions over the composition of a larger bench to hear the presidential reference seeking interpretation and scope of Article 63 (A) of the Constitution.
Justice Isa and Justice Sardar Tariq Masood had not been included in any bench hearing political high-profile cases during CJP Bandial's tenure.
Both judges also strongly objected to CJP Bandial nominations of junior high courts judges for their elevation to the SC.
Currently, the SC was still short of two judges.
Last year, the Judicial Commission of Pakistan members had written to CJP Bandial to summon meeting to consider the appointment of new SC judges.
It was understood that Justice Isa's case had severely affected the working of the apex court. The proceedings in the case negatively affected the relationship among the SC judges, who expressed their differences through judicial orders, speeches and letters.
In August 2021, the controversy further deepened, when one section of the SC led by incumbent CJP Bandial had withdrawn Justice Isa and Justice Jamal Mandokhail's judicial order regarding the harassment of journalists.
The same judges held that the CJP was the sole authority to invoke or assume suo motu jurisdiction under Article 184(3) of the Constitution.
Interestingly, Justice Isa and Justice Mandokhail were not included in that larger bench which was examining the legality of both the judges’ order.
However, Justice Isa while defending exercising the suo motu jurisdiction in same matter had said that he was targeted for no reason other than doing his duty.
The SC judge while issuing a notice to then acting CJP Bandial said that public perception could not be gained by simply denying that a judge of the apex court “is not targeted or persecuted”.
The current controversy started on the composition of benches couple of months ago.
On Feb 28, two judges namely Justice Isa and Justice Yahya Afridi had refused to hear cases on account of the sudden change in the composition of their benches.

5,IHC upholds ban: G-B police can’t escort CM in provinces,CM gives undertaking for not deploying police outside limits in future,"The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has upheld the federal government's ban on the Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) police, halting it from going to other provinces for the security of the chief minister.
Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani heard the request of G-B CM Khalid Khurshid against the order barring the regional police from going to other provinces for his security.
Lawyers Mian Ali Ashfaq and Qadir Janjua appeared in court on behalf of the petitioners. The Ministry of Interior additional secretary, Additional Attorney General Manoor Iqbal Dogul, and others appeared in court on behalf of the federal government.
During the hearing on Thursday, the additional attorney general presented the rules related to VIP security in court on behalf of the federal government.

The rules regarding VIP security were approved by the cabinet on September 10, 2021, during the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government, the court was apprised.
According to the rules, the security of VIPs was the responsibility of the respective provincial governments.
The Ministry of Interior had banned G-B police personnel from accompanying the CM to other provinces. It issued a notification on March 24 in this regard.
The notification of the ministry was challenged by the G-B CM and the regional government.
The court said that the G-B police could not be deployed outside its designated limits for VIP security.
The chief minister also gave an undertaking to the court that the G-B police would not be deployed in any province for VIP security in the future.
The G-B police could only be posted at the G-B House, Islamabad, outside of its limits, like the police of other provinces were stationed in the provincial houses in Islamabad.
The court said that the rules made by the federal cabinet regarding VIP security should be fully implemented.
