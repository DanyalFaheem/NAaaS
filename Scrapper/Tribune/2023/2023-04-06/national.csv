0,No solution to $27b Iraq energy deal yet,Country’s new govt wants 40% share in project,"The stalled agreement between Iraq and TotalEnergies over a $27 billion energy project has yet to find a resolution, the French oil major’s Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne said at the firm’s climate update on Tuesday.
TotalEnergies agreed in September 2021 to invest in four oil, gas and renewables projects in Iraq’s southern Basra region over 25 years, with an initial $10 billion. But the deal has been stuck amid disputes over terms.
Iraq’s new government, voted in last October, insists the country take a 40% share in the project, which has been a key sticking point, sources said. “I hope we find common ground. I worked on it in the last month, but again, we need to have this political answer,” he said.

1,LCCI protests policy hike,Says unprecedented increase will lead to rapid de-industrialisation,"The Lahore Chamber of Commerce & Industry (LCCI) has expressed dismay over the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) latest policy hike, which has taken the policy rate to a staggering 21%. According to the LCCI, this unprecedented increase in markup rate will put all businesses in deep trouble, leading to a rapid de-industrialisation across the country.
In a statement released on Wednesday, LCCI President Kashif Anwar, Senior Vice President Zafar Mahmood Chaudhry, and Vice President Adnan Khalid Butt said that the increase in markup rate will have dire consequences for the growth of trade and industry. Instead of trying to control inflation by increasing interest rates, the LCCI believes that the best way to reduce inflationary pressures is by increasing domestic production, industrialisation, and export growth.
“The prevailing policy rate in Pakistan is already much higher than other economies in the region,” said Anwar. “This essentially means that access to finance, which is imperative for the growth of industry and trade, is already more expensive in Pakistan as compared to other economies in the region.” The LCCI officials added that the increase in policy rate would massively escalate the borrowing cost of the government, resulting in further worsening of the fiscal deficit. Furthermore, the hike in markup rate has brought borrowing costs to the highest in the last six years.

2,ECC approves Rs300m for repair of public buildings,Adopts new guidelines for import of animals and their products,"The government on Wednesday sanctioned a budget of Rs300 million for the renovation of its buildings and adopted new guidelines of an international organisation for the import of live animals and their products.
The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) approved a supplementary grant of Rs300 million in favour of the Ministry of Housing and Works for the repair and maintenance of public buildings, according to the finance ministry.
The government decided to renovate the public buildings in the middle of implementation of an austerity policy. The ECC also approved a supplementary grant of Rs87.2 million in favour of the Intelligence Bureau for the payment of taxes and duties.
It approved a summary of the commerce ministry to bring amendments to the Import Policy Order 2022 for the import of live animals and their products.
These amendments are being made in line with the revised guidelines of the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) on animal (cattle) trade.
According to the new amendments, the import of live cattle, meat and bone meal (MBM) and feed ingredients of animal origin are banned from countries classified by WOAH in the latest edition of Terrestrial Animal Health Code as Controlled Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) Risk and Undetermined BSE Risk.
Live cattle and commodities of bovine origin are importable from countries subject to conditions that the country, zone, or compartment is classified by WOAH in the latest edition of Terrestrial Animal Health Code as Negligible BSE status, and the state veterinary authority in the exporting country shall certify that the cattle being exported were born and raised in the country of origin or from cattle that have been legally imported.
The exporter of the animals will certify that the feeding of meat and bone meal and greaves of ruminant origin to ruminants was banned and effectively enforced at least two years prior to the birth of said categories of animals being exported, and meat and meat products were not derived from the specified risk material for BSE disease.
Live animals, other than cattle, and products of animal origin containing no other tissues from the cattle mentioned are importable regardless of the BSE status of the exporting country: pets (status of the exporting country; pets (cats, dogs and fancy birds), products of animal origin are importable from controlled and undetermined BSE Risk status country subject to certification by the veterinary authority in the exporting country.
The ECC, after discussion, deferred decision on a summary of the Ministry of Commerce for amendment in the IPO 2022 pertaining to used auto lube oil and a summary of the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication, seeking approval of National Telecommunication Corporation’s (NTC) budget for FY2021-22 and 2022-23.

3,Pak Suzuki raises price for the fourth time,"Prices of PSMC cars have increased up to Rs235,000, will come into effect from April 6","Pak Suzuki Motor Company (PSMC) has raised the prices of its cars for the fourth time this year, with the highest increase being Rs 235,000. The new prices will come into effect from April 6, 2023.
The cumulative hike in vehicle rates in 2023 alone is up to Rs 1.203 million. The auto sector is already experiencing a decline in sales, with a 20-25% drop being reported in recent months, which auto experts attribute to high prices and political instability. The prices are making it unaffordable for the middle-income class and lower-middle-income-class citizens to purchase cars. The rise in interest rates has made car leasing at 24-25% interest rates a challenging prospect, too.
Auto expert Mashood Ali Khan said, “The primary reason for this decline is the steep increase in prices. Moreover, the lack of flexibility in bank financing is also contributing to the problem. Even if car financing becomes more accessible, the issue of importing remains unresolved.”
“The unstable political situation in the country has further exacerbated the situation, leading to a decrease in demand and lack of confidence building,” said Khan.
“The price increase is likely due to the recent depreciation of the Pak rupee against the USD,” said auto sector analyst Arsalan Hanif.
Last month, Pak Suzuki managed to sell 978 units in Feb’23 due to low demand and reduction in purchasing power parity. “We expect a continuous increase in car prices will keep sales volumes in the range of 2,500-3,500 units per month,” added Hanif.
With each price hike, the auto sector is witnessing a decline in sales. The price hike has also led to a surge in the price of old cars in Pakistan.
H M Shahzad, a dealer of second-hand cars, said, “Unprecedented price hikes in new cars have led to a surge in the price of old cars in Pakistan as well. The price of old cars priced at Rs1,500,000 have now hit Rs1,800,000.”
The Suzuki Alto, Suzuki Wagon R, Suzuki Cultus, Suzuki Swift, Suzuki Ravi, and Suzuki Bolan have all been affected by the price increase.
The Alto VX, VXR, VXR AGS, and Alto AGS have increased their prices by Rs 107,000, Rs 125,000, Rs 134,000, and Rs 140,000, respectively.
The Wagon R VXR and VXL have both increased their prices by Rs 152,000 and Rs 164,000, respectively. The Wagon R AGS’s price has gone up by Rs 178,000.
The Cultus VXR has increased its price by Rs 178,000, the VXL by Rs 195,000, and the AGS by Rs 209,000.
The Swift GL MT, GL CVT, and GLX CVT have all increased their prices by Rs 204,000, Rs 219,000, and Rs 235,000, respectively.
The Suzuki Ravi has increased its price by Rs 88,000, and the Suzuki Bolan has increased its price by Rs 92,000.
The drop in regulatory duty on used imported cars, however, may provide a solution for both parties. The SRO of additional customs duties on used cars expired on March 31, 2023, which means there is now no RD on used cars in Pakistan. Resultantly, the market for 660cc cars is expected to see a significant surge, as customers can now save between Rs600,000 to Rs800,000 on their purchases.
“Unfortunately, the rise in car prices has left the old car market in a state of limbo,” said Muhammad Sabir Shaikh, an auto expert.

4,Parco on verge of closure as diesel stocks jump,Rampant Iranian oil smuggling reduces demand for diesel supplies,"As the smuggled Iranian oil floods Pakistan’s markets over weak government control due to dollar shortage, diesel stocks have jumped to the historic level of 46 days of consumption, pushing the country’s largest refinery, Pak-Arab Refinery Limited (Parco), towards shutdown.
According to market players, the government has deliberately loosened control over the smuggling of oil due to the scarcity of dollars for petroleum imports. This strategy has created an Iranian oil glut in Pakistan’s markets as domestic demand for diesel and petrol dropped to half.
Consequently, the government is not only losing revenue of Rs1 billion per day but the situation is also posing a grave risk to the survival of oil industry, whose sales have slowed down.
Oil industry stakeholders voiced concern over the excessive Iranian oil smuggling and other issues at a meeting chaired by State Minister of Petroleum Musadik Malik on Tuesday. The meeting was attended by the Petroleum Division secretary and a large number of oil companies’ representatives, who complained about several challenges and protested over government’s inability to address those issues.
The issues raised by the oil companies included delay in recovery of exchange rate losses, artificial control over oil pricing, freight problems and curbs on Letters of Credit (LCs) for legal oil imports.
The meeting was told that the oil industry had been barred from opening LCs whereas the smuggling of oil continued at a rapid pace, posing a threat to the operations of local refineries.
It was further informed that petroleum stocks at Parco had piled up to unsustainable levels owing to the reluctance of oil marketing companies (OMCs) to procure the required quantities of diesel and petrol.
Parco representatives told the state minister that the refinery’s output had dipped to 75% as OMCs were not lifting the stocks. They feared that the refinery could shut down in the coming days if the situation persisted.
Earlier, the oil refineries had shut down in the face of furnace oil glut after power producers refused to purchase the stocks.
Now, the same situation has emerged in the case of diesel and petrol, whose stocks are growing with no demand in market even during the current crop harvesting season. Instead, consumers are inclined towards the smuggled oil.
According to sources, it is estimated that 10,000 to 12,000 tons of oil is being smuggled every day into the country. They pointed out that besides the daily revenue loss of around Rs1 billion to the government due to the oil smuggling, sales of the domestic oil industry have also slowed down.
According to them, the country has stocks of 670,000 tons of high-speed diesel, which is enough to meet consumer demand for 46 days.
In the case of petrol, the country has 550,000 tons of stocks that will satisfy consumption needs for 26 days.
According to the law, oil companies are required to maintain stocks of petroleum products for at least 20 days of consumption. In the past, they had hardly maintained stocks which triggered oil crisis several times.
Average demand for diesel in April is estimated at 14,000 tons per day as opposed to 26,500 tons in the same period of last year.
Oil industry officials cautioned the government that demand had dropped to half, which was threatening the functioning of oil refineries.

5,"Despite rate hike, rupee slumps to new low",Currency market awaits resumption of IMF loan programme,"In the prolonged wait for a breakthrough in talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Pakistani rupee hit a new record low for the second consecutive day on Wednesday.
According to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) data, the rupee maintained its downturn for the fourth successive working day, losing a cumulative 1.50%, or Rs4.19, to an all-time low at Rs287.85 against the US dollar in inter-bank market.
The currency has remained under pressure amid low supplies of the US dollar coupled with pent-up demand for imports.
Market talk suggests some pundits were expecting a partial recovery of the rupee after the central bank jacked up the benchmark policy rate by 100 basis points (bps) to a record high at 21%.
Pakistan’s critically low foreign currency reserves of $4.24 billion, the upcoming foreign debt repayments and rising import demand all pulled the rupee down.
Experts said that heightened political instability and economic meltdown were the leading reasons for the continuous delay in revival of the IMF’s $6.5 billion loan programme.
The rupee dropped on Wednesday despite State Bank Governor Jameel Ahmad’s announcement a day ago that friendly countries would make financial commitments, which was the last condition of the IMF for resuming its programme.
He hoped that the foreign exchange reserves would cross $10 billion by the end of June 2023, once the government struck a staff-level agreement (SLA) with the IMF.
Analysts voice hope that the rupee will make a partial recovery after the resumption of loan programme, which has remained on hold since November 2022.
Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, along with his economic team, is going to visit the US from April 10 to 16 to attend annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank, where he is also expected to talk about the IMF programme.
Gold at new peak
Gold hit a new record high for the second consecutive day on Wednesday, touching Rs217,000 per tola (11.66 grams). The All Pakistan Saraf Gems and Jewellers Association (APSGJA) reported that the bullion price rose by Rs2,500 per tola in a day.
The increase came in line with the uptrend in global markets. The metal’s price soared $41 to $2,023 per ounce (31.10 grams) in the international market.
Rupee’s depreciation also caused the rise in the price of precious metal in the country.

6,Govt meets another World Bank loan condition,Hopes to qualify for $450 million loan to bridge financing gap of $6 billion,"Pakistan on Wednesday met another World Bank (WB) condition in order to qualify for a $450 million loan to bridge a $6 billion financing gap, as so far only one country has verbally communicated its decision to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to give additional loans.
The condition was met days before Finance Minister Ishaq Dar’s meeting with the outgoing World Bank president in Washington in which he is expected to request the lender to set a board meeting date for the approval of the loan.
Despite making a request, however, until Wednesday Pakistan was unable to secure a meeting between Dar and the IMF Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva.
The National Tax Council (NTC), on Wednesday, approved rules to determine the place where a service will be deemed to be provided by a province for the purpose of collecting sales tax. The World Bank has asked for the harmonisation of sales tax on goods and services as a condition to the loan.
The NTC approved the draft Place of Provision of Service Rules, a major milestone towards General Sales Tax (GST) harmonisation across the country, according to the finance ministry. The approval will help achieve the prior actions for the World Bank funded RISE programme, it added.
After approval from their respective cabinets, the provinces will notify the Place of Provision of Services Rules by May 1, according to the decision. The NTC is the administrative coordination body on taxation matters between the centre and the four federating units.
Sindh was of the opinion that the rules be applied from the next fiscal year but the centre requested implementation from April to qualify for the WB loan.
Pakistani authorities said that the approval and implementation of the rules was the only condition remaining for the approval of the second Resilient Institutions for Sustainable Economy (RISE-II) loan worth $450 million. Sources said that, after its approval, Dar will now request the WB’s top management to convene a board meeting and approve the loan.
The WB’s outgoing President David Malpass’ term is going to end this month. President Joe Biden has nominated Ajay Banga as new president of the WB. His term will begin from the month of May subject to approval from the board on May 1st. Sources told The Express Tribune that the United States has sought Pakistan’s support in Banga’s candidacy.
Dar may also request the WB to de-couple the RISE-II loan from the second Programme for Affordable Energy (PACE-II) worth $600 million. The WB believes that Pakistan cannot achieve macroeconomic stability until its power sector is fixed. The conditions for the RISE-II loan pertain to the country’s fiscal and macroeconomic framework, involving the provinces too. The PACE-II loan aims to reduce circular debt flow by reducing power generation costs.
The $450 million WB loan proceeds are critical for Pakistan, currently struggling to arrange $6 billion in additional loans, including $3 billion immediately to convince the IMF to announce a staff level agreement.
For the current fiscal year, the government had hoped to receive from $30 billion to $32 billion in foreign financing but those plans now appear unrealistic. The financing plan included loans worth $2.9 billion from the WB. So far, only Saudi Arabia has verbally confirmed to the IMF that it will extend a $2 billion loan to Pakistan out of the required funds of $6 billion. The confirmation from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is still pending. The government has recently resolved a long outstanding issue and allowed the UAE airlines to operate A-380 flights – their biggest airplane – to major Pakistani airports. Earlier, the aviation ministry was resisting the demand.
Sources said that Pakistan was also trying to secure a meeting between Dar and Georgieva, as no bilateral meeting could take place in October last year on the side-lines of the WB-IMF annual meetings.

design: Ibrahim Yahya
The spring meetings of the WB-IMF will take place from April 10 to 16. Last time, Pakistan’s finance minister had met with the IMF’s deputy managing director. This time, too, it has gotten a confirmation for a meeting with the same.
In January, the World Bank spokesperson had told The Express Tribune that the indicative date for the board to discuss the RISE-II project was fiscal year 2024 – starting on July 1, 2023 and ending on June 30, 2024. The Pakistani authorities, however, believe that they can convince the lender to approve the loan before June due to the ongoing economic crisis.
The NTC on Wednesday also decided that services relating to electric power transmission will be a provincial subject and the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) will take necessary action to exclude electricity from the list of goods so that the transmission of electricity can be treated as a service as decided by the NTC. The amendment will be made in the Sales Tax Act of 1990 to give effect to the decision from July.
In the last meeting of the NTC executive committee, the FBR chairman showed concern about electricity being treated as a good under the Sale Tax Act, therefore, before framing rules for services relating to electric power transmission by provinces, an amendment in the Sales Tax Act is required.

7,Investors withdraw $190m in Feb,Pull out capital from national saving schemes due to uncompetitive rate of return,"Investors in Pakistan have been aggressively withdrawing investments from various national saving schemes due to significantly low rates-of-return (RoR) compared to the ones offered by banks on fixed investments. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reported on Wednesday that investors withdrew Rs32.38 billion ($190 million) from saving schemes alone in February 2023, with a total disinvestment of Rs285.73 billion ($1.7 billion) in the first eight months (Jul-Feb) of the current fiscal year 2023.
Speaking to the Express Tribune on the condition of anonymity, a Central Directorate of National Savings (CDNS) official said, “Who will invest in national saving schemes at the prevailing RoR at around 12% compared to 22% on three-month T-bills (the government debt instrument)? The rate of return has become uncompetitive… it has gone dead.”
Additionally, the government also deducts 30% tax on profit from the saving schemes from non-filers, he said.
The CDNS reported that it is offering RoR in the range of 12.26% to 14.16% on saving schemes, including Defence Saving Certificates (DSC), Behbood Savings Certificates (BSC), Shuhadas Family Welfare Account (SFWA), and Regular Income Certificates (RIC). The CDNS is also offering profit in the range of 16.12% on investment in three-month Short-Term Savings Certificates (STSC), 16% on six-month paper, and offers 15.96% RoR on 12-month STSC.
The CDNS official stated that “individuals and corporates are withdrawing investment from saving schemes prematurely (before the period of investment is completed) to relocate investment to higher return offering instruments.”
The official added that some banks are now offering an RoR of around 22% on fixed investment for up to three years, and “knowledge-based investors may be relocating their capital to more lucrative assets.”
In 2020, the government barred corporate investors from parking their savings into CDNS saving schemes, as they can invest directly in government debt securities like three to 12-month T-bills and three to 20-year PIBs. The outflows from outstanding investment with CDNS are partially seen due to the maturing of investment by corporates or they are prematurely withdrawing the investment to take position in lucrative instruments like the T-bills and PIBs, he added.
This is the third consecutive year in a row in which investors are pulling capital from saving schemes. Earlier, corporate withdrawal was a leading reason behind the aggressive outflows, but now, it is most likely individuals who are divesting due to the offer of low profit.
The central bank reported that the outstanding investment in saving schemes (net of prize bonds) has reduced to Rs2.92 trillion ($17 billion) in February 2023, compared to Rs3.48 trillion ($20 billion) in the same month of the last year, showing a drop of 16% (or Rs565 billion) in one year. The outstanding investment in prize bonds, however, improved to Rs381.5 billion ($2.2 billion) in February 2023, compared to Rs373.4 billion ($2.1 billion) in February 2022.
The central bank data suggests investors have pulled out Rs26.68 billion ($157 million) from Defence Saving Certificates (DSC) during Jul-Feb FY23, withdrew another Rs26.76 billion ($158 million) from Regular Income Certificates (RIC), divested Rs71.89 billion ($423 million) from Special Savings Certificates (SSC), and disinvested another Rs167.26 billion ($983 million) from other schemes. They, however, purchased prize bonds worth Rs6.87 billion ($40 million) in the first eight months of FY23.
CDNS reinvests the funds taken from individuals into three to 10-year PIBs and distributes profits among its investors from the profits earned on PIBs. Commercial banks bought three-year PIB at an RoR at 18.05% in mid-March. They acquired five-year bonds at the rate of 13.80%.
In the secondary market, the yield on three-year PIB hovered at 18.23%, on five-year bond at 15.16% and on 10-year PIB the yields stood at 15.24% in mid-March.
This shift away from national saving schemes and towards government debt securities is worrying news for the Pakistani government, which relies on savings mobilised through CDNS to finance its fiscal deficit. With investors increasingly turning to the more lucrative government debt securities, the government’s reliance on commercial banks for financing is set to increase.
As of mid-March, commercial banks lent to the government at a historic high rate of 23% against acquiring T-bills. The government is now under pressure to offer more attractive RoRs to savers in order to keep them invested in national saving schemes.
The government is mandated to revise saving rates every month, but it has not revised the rates for several months, said the CDNS official, adding that the weighted average RoR on national saving schemes should be 95% of the return on PIBs as per the relevant law.
