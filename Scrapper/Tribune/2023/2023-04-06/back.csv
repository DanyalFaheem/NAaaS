0,Pakistan gets Saudis’ ‘green signal' for $2b funding,Development major leap towards securing staff-level pact with global lender,"Pakistan has received the nod for funding to the tune of $2 billion from Saudi Arabia, finance ministry sources on Wednesday said.
The development is a significant step towards reaching a staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has imposed the condition of Pakistan securing $3 billion from other countries for the revival of its $6.5 billion bailout package.
Apart from Saudi Arabia giving the green signal for the provision of $2 billion to Pakistan, the sources said Finance Minister Ishaq Dar would meet the leadership of the UAE before leaving for the US on April 10.
The sources further said the IMF was still insisting on its demand for a further increase in the interest rate according to inflation and opposing the annual subsidy of Rs900 billion.
They added that the global lender was unwilling to budge from its demand for Pakistan to collect Rs850 billion in terms of the petroleum development levy (PDL).
The finance ministry sources said the IMF was demanding from Pakistan to reduce its import of petrol and diesel.
They added that the global lender had also demanded to meet the shortfall of the PDL and taxes.
The IMF has been pushing the government to increase the PDL to Rs50 per litre on all petroleum products, according to the sources.
The federal government had recently increased the PDL on high-speed diesel (HSD) by Rs5 per litre, pushing it up from Rs45 to Rs50 per litre.
The government had already increased the PDL on high-quality petrol to Rs50 per litre in November last year.
Back then, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet, after deliberations, allowed the increase in PDL from Rs30 to Rs50 per litre on RON 95 and above-grade fuel with effect from November 16, 2022.
Last month, the IMF said Pakistan had made ""substantial progress"" toward meeting policy commitments needed to unlock loans the country needs to avoid default.
The international lender said Pakistan had a few more tasks before it could unlock a $6.5 billion loan to avoid a default, putting pressure on the government to secure assurances from countries that have promised financing support.
Esther Perez Ruiz, the IMF’s resident representative for Pakistan, said a staff-level agreement would follow once the few remaining points were closed.
The country has taken tough measures including increasing taxes and energy prices, and allowing its currency to weaken to restart the $6.5 billion IMF loan package.

The Bureau has provided the design, and strategic approach, and equipped the provincial and district governments with the technology and tools for complete transparency and real-time progress monitoring of census activities, along with daily oversight and feedback to further improve the data collection exercise in real-time.
The real-time data progress monitoring dashboards, developed in partnership with NADRA and provided by PBS from the provincial to the district governments, help provincial governments in identifying any abnormalities, any areas missed and any other emerging anomalies on a daily basis.
The data received is analysed on a daily basis by the Bureau's concerned staffers at headquarters and immediately communicated to the provinces for their resolution to ensure timely response and universal and complete coverage.
The PBS claimed that this was 7th housing and population census and the first digital census is a historic milestone and the first digital census of its kind in South Asia.
This successful execution of the census has been made possible through the commendable Pakistan Bureau of Statistics and relentless efforts of the Provincial and District Governments to ensure complete and credible census field operations with the support of the technology support provided by NADRA.

Recently, on the directions of the Prime Minister of Pakistan Shehbaz Sharif, the 495 Census Support Centers are now also working as points of referral for all missed areas.
The success of the current census is also attributed to the rigorous, universally standardized training provided by Pakistan Bureau of Statistics to 121000 field enumerators that were identified and selected by the provinces, along with 126000 tablets to digitize the data collection process.
The main objective of the Census is to provide data for informed decision-making for policy planning for the people living in particular areas so that required resources can be provided for the provision of basic necessities like schools, hospitals, roads and others. Questions asked in the census pertain to the number of people and living standards.
Census is not linked to the voter nor does it have the ability to discriminate. It is a mandatory civic duty which all of us need to participate in, for our future, for the future of our children and for the future of the country.

2,Private persons can’t file sedition cases: IHC,Unveils 7-page detailed verdict in Shandana Gulzar case,"The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has issued a guideline with regard to sedition cases, noting that such complaints must be initiated by the federal or a provincial government by an authorized person “after considering the relevant factors of the alleged incident with reasons”.
The IHC on Wednesday unveiled a seven-page detailed verdict in the Shandana Gulzar Khan case. Shandana, a Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and lawmaker leader, was booked in a sedition case on January 30 over controversial remarks that she made in a TV show. Shandana was the third PTI lawmaker to be booked for alleged sedition after Azam Swati and Shahbaz Gill.
In the FIR, the complainant had alleged that the PTI leader had made serious allegations against the armed forces and attempted to incite violence. The FIR said the PTI leader had implied that terrorism was spread across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) province in a planned way.
According to the FIR, Shandana had tried to create disharmony and incite violence in the country. A single judge bench of the IHC comprising Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, however, quashed the FIR on March 24.
In the detailed verdict, the court noted that on plain reading of the contents of the FIR as well as the recorded interview text, it appeared that the accused made sarcastic remarks about certain personalities and as such there was no element of incitement or sedition in the comments.

It said in cases of sedition, allegations of incitement of public to insurrection and rebellion are required to be demonstrated either through words used or from any other evidence or action of the accused.
""Sedition has been described, as disloyalty in action and the law considers as sedition all those practices, which have for their object to excite discontent or dissatisfaction, to create public disturbance, or to lead to civil war, which is not the case in hand.""
Presenting a seven-point guideline, the court noted that the offence must contain promotion of feeling of enmity, hatred or ill-will among different religious or racial or linguistic or regional groups or castes in order to qualify as sedition.
“Words, deeds or writing used to disturb the tranquility of the state or to subvert the government [or to] incite the people to incursion and rebellion [may qualify as sedition].”
The verdict said such a complaint must be initiated by the federal or a provincial government by an authorized person under the law after considering the relevant factors of the alleged incident with reasons.
“Private persons cannot agitate the matter regarding seditions of charge; rather it should be initiated, inquired and investigated by the government or at least on their direction.
“Criminal conspiracy can only be considered if the other principal offence comes on record on the basis of allegations referred [to] in the complaint in each case. Authorized officers shall state reason before issuing any sanction in terms of Sections 196 and 196-A, CrPC with speaking order,” it said.
The court also noted that no useful purpose was served by placing such criminal cases before the court as it will consume much time and resources of the state with unnecessary burden.
“Therefore, quashing of such FIRs is more advisable,"" it added.

5,PPP gears up poll preparations,PML-N leaders maintain elections will not be held next month,"With Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) exhausting its energy trying to intercept the Punjab elections, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) has geared up preparation for upcoming polls.
A PPP official said that the preparation would be completed by Friday. The party claimed that the decision of allotting the tickets in Lahore Urban, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala and Sahiwal has already been taken while the tickets holders of South Punjab, Lahore Rural. Faisalabad and Sargodha will be finalised by Friday.
He said that PPP leader Faryal Talpur presided over the meeting to finalize the tickets via video link.
He added that the PPP Punjab was moving ahead with its preparations, disregarding the developments unfolding in Islamabad.
However, PPP Punjab leader Hasan Murtaza said that elections would not be held in Punjab on the given date, adding: “Elections will take place simultaneously throughout the country to ensure free and fair elections.”
He was of the view that holding elections in Punjab would lead to “anarchy”. He said the PPP, despite its principle position on the issue, was completing is ground work for elections.
PML-N leaders revealed that their party, on the other hand, was not even bothered with election preparations. A senior PML-N leader, while talking to the Express Tribune, said that there was no word regarding elections in the party.
He said all the candidates were preparing in their constituencies, but since they were not a 100 per cent sure to get the party ticket, they were not trying their best.
In many constituencies, he said there were more than two candidates vying for the same ticket. “How could any one of them go all in for elections without knowing if they will get the ticket or not?” he questioned.
He was expecting delay in the elections since “the PTI has also not finalized their candidates.”
He reflected on the speculations within the PML-N regarding elections, saying: “If elections are to be delayed, then there is no point going through all the hassle”.

6,MNA slams ‘fatal’ flaws in free flour scheme,Govt lawmakers continue to criticise SC's elections case decision,"The federal government's free flour scheme on Wednesday came under heavy criticism during the National Assembly session as a lawmaker condemned the loss of lives during its distribution.
PTI MNA Sardar Riaz Mehmood Khan Mazari delivered a passionate speech in a sitting of the lower house of parliament, chaired by NA Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, on a call-attention notice to highlight the “lost sense of morality” in the country.
Mazari pointed out that the offer of free items usually attracted people, but unless there was a change in morality, the situation would not improve.
He also described the scheme as ""all lies and fraud,"" drawing attention to how some people acquired free flour and sold it at their shops, thereby defeating the purpose of the programme.
""If you want to provide flour, do not make people stand in queues,"" he continued.
""There are those who are not entitled to free flour but are receiving it. People have lost their sense of shame; we are morally bankrupt,” he added.
Mazari went on to question whether a fresh election would end the flour crisis or inflation.
He demanded that procedures be put in place to provide free flour to those who really needed it.
He regretted the loss of lives in stampedes at distribution points in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.
During the sitting, the Supreme Court's decision in the case of Punjab elections, wherein it had ruled that the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) move to postpone the polls till October was “unconstitutional”, again sparked a heated debate among lawmakers.
Some government members staged protests and criticised the court's ruling.
The lawmakers urged institutions to work within their limits, with Federal Power Minister Khurram Dastgir of the PML-N maintaining that the country needed the “doctrine of democracy”, and not the doctrine of necessity.

Dastgir criticised the SC verdict, claiming that the apex court had once again revived the doctrine of necessity, and the convictions of former premiers Nawaz Sharif and Yousuf Raza Gilani were still controversial.
Federal Information Technology and Telecommunication Minister Aminul Haque of the MQM-P called for a full court bench to hear the matter, as he believed that the scales were not equal in the SC decision.
Haque also questioned why the court only spoke about elections in Punjab within 90 days and not in K-P, suggesting that someone had received “support”.
Federal Religious Affairs Minister Mufti Abdul Shakoor of the Jamiat Ulama-e-Islam Pakistan and Jamaat-e-Islami also expressed their dismay over the judgment.
The JI demanded single-day general elections across the country.
Its MNA, Abdul Akbar Chitrali, highlighted the risk of a constitutional crisis.
He called on the government and the opposition to sit together and fix a date for elections.
In his remarks, Riaz Mehmood Khan Mazari maintained that “indecency” in parliament began in 1988 and that the “culture of abuse” was the main reason for his disagreement with his party, the PTI.
The speaker reminded the lawmakers that rules did not allow chanting slogans or bringing posters in parliament and it should be avoided in the future.
Independent MNA Mohammad Aslam Bhootani expressed his concerns about the current situation in the superior judiciary, saying that it was not being viewed favourably.
He further pointed out that the formation of a six-member SC bench, which  “recalled” the interim order issued by Justice Qazi Faez Isa and Justice Aminuddin Khan wherein they had ordered the postponement of suo motu matters, undermined the status of the senior pusine judge.
He added that the dissolving of the assemblies of Punjab and K-P had created a constitutional crisis that led to political instability.
PPP MNA Naz Baloch also weighed in, saying that her party’s founder and former premier, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was subjected to “judicial murder” on April 4, and his killers were the ones who were mandated to deliver justice.
She also blamed PTI chief Imran Khan for the country's economic problems and other crises.
Minister of State for Finance Dr Ayesha Ghous Pasha expressed her concerns about the PTI government’s violations of the agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that had created an atmosphere of distrust.
She added that discussions were under way with friendly countries including China, Saudi Arabia, and UAE to meet external funding requirements.
The state minister noted that a staff-level agreement with the IMF would be signed soon once its conditions in connection with external funding were met.

7,Minister predicts another winter with no gas,"High demand, lack of infrastructure blamed for the shortfall","Minister of State for Petroleum Musadik Malik has said things are moving ahead smoothly and Pakistan is going to collect the first consignment of Russia crude oil this month.
“Import of crude oil from Russia will start this month,” Malik said on Wednesday while addressing petroleum dealers, businessmen and industrialists in Karachi.
In October last year, Pakistan said it was considering buying discounted Russian crude, citing neighbouring India, which has been purchasing oil from Moscow.
Later in January, Russian Energy Minister Nikolay Shulginov said his country could start exporting oil to energy-starved Pakistan after March if terms were agreed.
“We are discussing with Islamabad whether payment could be made in the currencies of ‘friendly’ countries,” he had said during a visit to Pakistan.
Pakistani officials and Shulginov had confirmed that key elements of the deal had yet to be agreed.
""As for the supply of crude oil and petroleum products, we conceptually agreed on the development and signing of an agreement that will determine and resolve all issues of logistics, insurance, payment and volumes,"" Shulginov was later quoted as saying by the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti.
Malik said oil dealers had given some suggestions regarding provision of cheap petrol. “The ministry of petroleum will prepare a scheme for supply of cheap petrol only after reviewing it,” he added.
The state minister said the country's gas reserves were rapidly depleting and that Pakistan would face a gas shortage in winter this year as well.
""Our gas reserves are depleting and round-the-clock gas supply is not possible. The demand for gas increases from November. Due to rains and cold weather in Balochistan, the demand for gas has increased there,” he added.
Malik said they have taken notice of shortage of electricity and gas in Karachi.
""We are making efforts to ensure an uninterrupted supply of electricity and gas to the consumers during suhoor and iftar hours [in Ramazan],"" he remarked. ""In this regard, we have also spoken to the governor of Sindh. However, I will request people to pay their bills.""
He said industries in Karachi have also complained about non-supply of electricity and gas, and small industries also have objections to electricity rates. “Due to the lack of infrastructure in Karachi, there are obstacles in the supply of gas to some areas,” he added.

8,SC hints at forming JC in Arshad’s killing case,Says it wants transparent investigation into the matter,"The Supreme Court has indicated it could form a judicial commission in slain journalist Arshad Sharif’s suo motu case.
The apex court has issued the written order of the last hearing held on March 17.
It said that it had received more than 5,000 letters, requesting the court to investigate the journalist’s murder and that it wanted transparent probe into the matter.
Arshad had left Pakistan in August last year after a number of cases were registered against him.
It was reported that he was initially staying in the UAE but later went to Kenya, where he was shot dead.
The government had subsequently constituted a team that travelled to Kenya to investigate the murder.
In the written order, the top court stated that if it was not satisfied with the investigation, a judicial commission would be constituted.
It further said that Arshad’s family lawyer Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui had objected to the court proceedings. According to him, the Supreme Court could not supervise the investigation of the JIT and that it could monitor and probe matters related to fundamental rights.
The court said that the additional attorney general (AAG) had informed the court about mutual legal assistance from Kenya and the UAE.
According to the AAG, Kenyan authorities had not yet responded about the mutual legal assistance.
The written order stated that the special JIT was given another three weeks for investigation from abroad.
It said that the court could form a judicial commission considering that the matter pertained to important fundamental rights.
It was further noted that Arshad’s murder was a matter of fundamental rights apart from being the murder of a prominent journalist.
Further hearing of the case will be held this month.

9,Legal eagles weighing in on SC verdict: minister,Tarar reiterates govt position of holding elections on same day,"Federal Law Minister Azam Nazir Tarar revealed on Thursday that legal consultations were going on following the Supreme Court’s suo motu notice and its judgement in the poll delay case.
Speaking to the international media, the law minister maintained that ""elections should be held [for the national and provincial assemblies] at the same time"".
""The Constitution states that the ECP is burdened with the responsibility of conducting elections,"" he furthered stressing that ""the mechanism for holding elections according to the Constitution exists"", implying that the court orders were contrary to it.
“The Constitution states that elections should be held within 90 days after dissolution, but there are many schemes in the Constitution and many other provisions of law,” he added.
He said that in 2010, amendments were made in articles 224 and 224(A) of the Constitution due to several experiments of elections.
He said that Article 217 states that elections in the country would be held simultaneously under the supervision of the Election Commission of Pakistan while Article 218(3) states that the Election Commission of Pakistan is responsible for conducting transparent and impartial elections in the country.
Reflecting on the ""controversial"" dissolution of the Punjab Assembly, he said that ""the matter was first referred to the Lahore High Court. The Punjab governor never signed the summary sent by the chief minister and 48 hours later the assembly dissolved on its own"".
""A nine-member bench began hearing the Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) polls delay case after the chief justice took a suo motu notice of the matter,"" he said, and added ""Two judges had already opined on the matter while two others recused themselves from hearing the case after expressing their opinion"".
He also lamented that the requests for a full court hearing were not entertained by the five-member bench later on.
Listing down his reservations, Tarar said that ""petitions [pertaining to the elections] are sub judice in the high courts of Punjab and K-P, there are security risks involved in both the provinces, the federal cabinet declared that the 'minority judgement' is unacceptable, the court did not even listen to the political parties, the federal cabinet has expressed concerns over the [recent] SC judgment"" and that ""senior judges are being kept away from the bench"".
In a nutshell, he said ""legal discussions are underway over the judgment"" hinting that the government did not plan to bow down any time soon.
