0,Noor Jehan’s survival chances improve,"Four Paws team says elephant still in lot of pain, conducts three-hour diagnosis","A team of international veterinarians that took part in a three-hour diagnostic examination of Noor Jehan at the Karachi zoo on Wednesday said the ailing 17-year-old African elephant might be out of danger but was still suffering and in a lot of pain.
The vets, part of the Four Paws team, arrived earlier this week after images and videos of the elephant struggling to move and visibly distressed in her cramped enclosure at the zoo were shared widely on social media. 
The vets, who a day earlier had put the animal's chances of survival at fifty-fifty, were upbeat after the examination. ""She is out of danger,"" said Egyptian Dr Amir Khalil, who led the team
The vets said they had detected inner hematoma and a damaged pelvic diaphragm. She also has intestinal issues. The doctors added that the x-ray didn't show any broken bones. 
Prof Dr Thomas Hildebrand of the Leibnitz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, who joined the team on Tuesday, said the animal had a lot of stress on her kidneys. ""It is causing abdominal pain.""
He hoped that after treatment, Noor Jehan might live for next 20 more years. African animal live to the age of 70 in the wild. 
There was also a tricky moment during the examination when the animal was sedated for examination while being strapped to a crane. 
The sedation had to be reversed after the animal couldn't be held upright even with the crane.
""Luckily, it was still possible to carry on with the examination as the team managed to calm her down by talking and standing by her side while the expert vets performed their procedures,"" the Four Paws team said. 
Tug of war
Meanwhile, the controversial zoo administrator, Khalid Hashmi, was hard to find as the elephant underwent the examination. There have been accusations of neglect, resulting in the death of animals. Visitors as well as workers at the zoo have complained that animals dietary requirements were not being met.
Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, who was at the zoo, instructed KMC Administrator Dr Saifur Rehman to find out the reason for the zoo administrator's absence.
He also acknowledge shortage of food and water for animals at the zoo. ""We also need to set up a laboratory and the hospital [for the zoo],"" he said.
The zoo administration has also been criticised for its failure to relocate Noor Jehan to the Safari Park, which had been suggested by the Four Paws team during their last visit.

3,Suspect strangles child after failed rape attempt,Body found dumped in manhole in Surjani Town,"In a harrowing sex-crime, a six-year-old girl was strangled to death by a suspected sexual pervert following a failed rape attempt in Surjani Town, it was revealed on Wednesday.
Muhammad Younis, resident of Sector 36 Market, Surjani Town, was renovating his house and his six-year-old daughter mysteriously disappeared after labourers had left at 6pm on April 4. He was helping his wife with iftar preparations when his daughter stepped out of home and went missing.

Edhi volunteers and police shifted the body to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital (ASH) where Police Surgeon Dr Samia performed the post-mortem on the body. She said that the sex offender might have strangled the victim after failing to rape her. ""DNA samples have all been collected and sent to the lab for confirmation,"" she added.
Bashir Wadu, SHO Surjani Town police station, said on the basis of preliminary investigation that the suspected killer might have been known to the girl and her family. ""He must have taken the girl to some abandoned location, tried to rape her, but strangled her to death after failing in his attempt,"" he said, adding that the killer might have killed the victim fearing that she would reveal his identity.
Pedophiles and sex offenders appear to be on the prowl in the metropolitan city as such rape-murder incidents have been reported in different parts of the city, including Quaidabad, Mehmoodabad, and Shah Latif Town.

4,One arrested for ‘conning’ BISP beneficiaries,Police say they caught him in the act of making illegal deductions from beneficiaries of the welfare programme,"Police on Wednesday arrested one man for making illegal deductions from payments meant for Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) beneficiaries.

Police said they caught him in the act of making illegal deductions from beneficiaries of the welfare programme. 
Two of his accomplices fled the scene while another accomplice, believed to be the mastermind, was not present there. 
The raid follows the publication of a story in this newspaper regarding agents deducting between Rs500 to Rs1,500 from payments of BISP beneficiaries. 
At the time of the raid, those present there accused police of targeting the wrong individuals. The illegal deductions were carried out by “device owners”, they said, and called for action against them instead of ordinary agents.

6,Imported fabrics go scarce in city’s markets,Sales have dropped by 40% in markets due to rising inflation and cost of living,"Imported unstitched fabric has become scarce in the city's markets due to several reasons, including poor economic conditions, rising inflation, and ongoing crackdown on smuggled fabrics by the Customs Department. Currently, only the affluent class can afford imported unstitched men's fabric available at expensive stores in the posh areas of the metropolitan city.
This Ramazan, shopkeepers and traders have reported a 40% decrease in the sales of unstitched men's fabrics. They say that customers prefer to buy inexpensive ready-made dresses. High cost of living and neck-breaking inflation are the main reasons behind the drop in sales and changes in trends. This has dampened Eid shopping in the city's markets where the number of shoppers this year is comparatively low.
Trader Eid Gul has witnessed a 40% decline in the sales of unstitched men's fabric. ""Currently, imports of unstitched men's fabrics from various countries are banned which have caused a hike in demand for locally produced fabrics,"" he told The Express Tribune. 
He said that young men prefer cotton from Faisalabad mills as it is affordable. ""Unstitched cotton fabric is available anywhere between Rs1,200 and Rs4,500 per suit,"" he added. However, wash-n-wear is popular among the middle-aged and elderly people. ""A wash-and-wear suit is available in the range of Rs1,400 and 5,500,"" he said.
According to Gul, the demand for waistcoat fabrics does not change during Eid shopping. The business and moneyed class wears waistcoats with shalwar-kameez. ""Unstitched waistcoat fabrics can cost you anywhere from Rs1,500 to Rs4,500 or even more, depending on the variety and quality,"" he said.
Gul said that the kurta-pyjama sales have dropped as inflation-hit people prefer to purchase ready-made dresses in summer and its fabric is produced in Faisalabad which can cost you up to Rs2,000. He went on to add that children like to wear soft cotton dresses, which can cost anywhere between Rs1,500 and 2,500 apiece.
People are buying affordable ready-made shalwar-kameez for Eid. Those who wear shalwar-kameez more frequently in daily life typically don tailored suits. The lifespan of a ready-made shalwar-kameez suit is no longer than six months, although it may endure longer and is not readily torn.
According to Gul, philanthropists and charitable organizations purchase unstitched white cotton suits in bulk to distribute among madrassa students. ""We give them discount since they buy in bulk,"" he said.
Gul further said that the elite class purchases unstitched, premium cotton and wash-n-wear fabric and have it stitched from tailors, which could cost them more than Rs10,000.

7,Liaquatabad hospital reduced to a ‘dispensary’,"Patients down to a trickle as staff absent, equipment dysfunctional","The Sindh Government Hospital Liaquatabad is a picture of willful neglect, seemingly abandoned by the health department. Not too long ago, the only public hospital in one of the most densely populated areas of the city had a busy emergency department where patients with heart, kidney, skin and other diseases as well as accidents were provided timely treatment.
Now, the 200-bed hospital is more akin to a dispensary, with medicines not available, and machines and equipment out of order. Most doctors and staff members are unavailable in the the afternoon and night shifts. 
The hospital saw a footfall of at least 100 patients daily. Now, that is down to a trickle. The facility would conduct around 400 to 500 tests daily, including a variety of blood tests as well as for cholesterol, calcium, creatinine and uric acid among others. At present, only CBC, urea and a few biochemistry tests are being done in the hospital at present. 
Several machines in the hospital have also malfunctioned, with doctors referring patients to private laboratories. The machinery for CT scan, lithotripsy, doppler, echocardiography and CTG were out of order.
Those who work at the hospital say that an average of 60 to 70 patients would be admitted to the hospital at any given time. ""Nowadays, patients have stopped visiting this hospital and around 10 patients are currently admitted here,"" said one staff member on condition of anonymity. 
In the past, more than 100 x-rays were conducted on a daily basis, but that now number has reduced by half. 
The patients admitted in the various wards allege that many doctors and medical staff do not come to perform their duties during the afternoon and night hours. Attendants pointed out that the administration was not interested in the decrepit state of the hospital. Onne visitor to the hospital said that the hospital did not have the rabies vaccine in spite of a Supreme Court order requiring government hospitals to maintain stocks of the drug.
Expectant mothers should visit the hospital at their own peril, with patients complaining of counterfeit medicines. One patient said they were not informed at the time of registration that the hospital did not offer c-section. ""They tell you at the time of delivery to take the patient to a private hospital,"" said one angry visitor. 
The hospital's medical superintendent, Dr. Tirth Kumar, cut a forlorn figure as he admitted to The Express Tribune that doctors and medical staff at the hospital were not reporting for duty. He said the hospital did not have enough funds to run the laboratory. "" I am trying my best to improve the management by using all the resources available to me.""
