0,Reference against judges: Not a viable option,Senior govt official says govt would not approve any proposal to file references in the SJC,"A “strong section” of the coalition government is pressing for filing references against the Supreme Court judges who on Tuesday directed the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to hold elections in Punjab on May 14.
However, legal wizards of the ruling parties especially those of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) are against this proposal, warning that it may backfire.
According to sources, one section within the government is advocating moving references against the members of the three-judge bench that delivered Tuesday's verdict.
The bench was led by Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial and comprised Justice Munib Akhtar and Justice Ijazul Ahsan.
These hawks are facing strong resistance from the legal minds of the ruling alliance.
""I have already advised my party leadership not to consider such a move as it will backfire badly. We should learn lessons from history. Even a military dictator [Pervez Musharraf] faced defeat when he filed a reference against a chief justice [Iftikhar Chaudhry],” said a senior lawyer of the PML-N while requesting anonymity.
He said the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government and the military establishment also faced humiliation when they filed a reference against Justice Qazi Faez Isa. The lawyer said such a move will unify the Supreme Court which is at present facing serious internal divisions.
“The PTI and the lawyers’ community will also take to streets in protest against such references and cause serious troubles for the federal government,” he added.
At present, the Professional Lawyers Group which is regarded as pro-PTI is dominant in the Supreme Court Bar Association and the Lahore High Court Bar Association.
Even senior members of the Independent Lawyers Group also believe that filing of references against the SC judges will be a blunder.
The Independent group, which is regarded as being pro-government, has a majority in the Pakistan Bar Council. However, dynamics have changed at bars and young lawyers are supporting the PTI. It is also witnessed that lawyers always get united whenever a government tries to target a judge.
Sources told The Express Tribune that the government legal team is also resisting the idea of filing references against top court judges. A senior government official said the government would not approve any proposal to file references in the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC).
President Dr Arif Alvi, who was a PTI leader before being elected as the president of the country, will also not forward any such reference to the SJ, they added.
In view of the SC jurisprudence, it is mandatory for the president to apply his mind as to whether the reference forwarded by the government has any substance.
The reference filed against Justice Qazi Faez Isa had to be quashed as the president had not applied his mind before forwarding it to the SJC under Article 209 of the Constitution.
Senior lawyer Akram Sheikh has also opposed the idea of filing references and recommended that the government annul the SC's judgment through legislation in public interest, said a source.
The CJP has discretionary power to initiate proceedings of misconduct against any judge.
A senior PML-N lawyer said when the CJP being the chairman of the SJC has unfettered powers then any move against him will not be successful.
Another lawyer said it will be presumed in the public that the government reference is a reaction to the judge’s April 4 verdict –an impression that will not go in favor of the ruling coalition.
Similarly no reference can be filed against a judge on account of his judicial order.

1,Centre spends ‘Rs710b’ on devolved ministries,WB says despite fiscal crunch huge spending contributing to higher public debt,"Amid severe fiscal constraints, the federal government is still spending over Rs710 billion every year by retaining 17 devolved ministries and financing development projects in areas that under the Constitution fall in the provincial domain, said the World Bank.
The huge spending is contributing to higher public debt besides keeping many initiatives of the Centre under-funded.
Before the devolution, the federal government was spending 0.39% of the GDP on the 17 ministries that were subsequently devolved to the provinces under the 18th Amendment in the Constitution.
However, after some time, the PPP government and its successive ones, revived all those ministries – a move that is now resulting in a duplication of the expenditures.
The spending on these 17 ministries has increased to 0.59% of the GDP or Rs328 billion per annum as of last fiscal year, said Derek Chen, a senior economist working with the World Bank.
In its recent publications, the World Bank has advised the federal government to realign its expenses only to those subjects, which under the Constitution were its responsibility.
Under the 18th Amendment in the Constitution, the Centre had increased the provincial share by 11% to 57.5% of the federal divisible pool on the grounds that the transfer of the new subjects to the provinces would need additional resources.
However, over the period of time, all these ministries were revived to accommodate ministers and bureaucrats.
However, the Centre still blames the 18th Constitutional Amendment for its own wrong policies.
Derek said half of the federal Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) or Rs315 billion was also spent on projects that fell under the provincial domain.
Another Rs70 billion is given to the Higher Education Commission every year.
The federal government spent Rs3.179 trillion alone on debt servicing during the first eight months of the current fiscal year -- a sum that was Rs17 billion more than its net income.
This means the Centre is now bearing all the expenses, including spending over Rs710 billion annually on provincial subjects, by taking more loans.
The interest that it will now pay on these loans will be over 22%.
The average budget deficit during the past 10 years was 6.8% of the GDP.
Chen said the persistent high deficit had led to the accumulation of a massive public debt.
“The strong expansionary fiscal policies also drove the higher imports and the consequent higher current account deficits,” he added.
For this fiscal year, the government will again breach its budget deficit target that the World Bank has now projected to widen to 6.9% of the GDP or Rs5.4 trillion.
The World Bank findings also showed how the rich class was availing subsidies meant for the impoverished people in Pakistan.
In 2019, the bottom 40% of the population was receiving only 24% of the subsidies while the rest of the people availed 64% of them, according to the World Bank staff’s calculations.
This ratio has now been reversed after the last round of electricity price hike.
In the fiscal year 2019, the poorest one-fifth of the population was receiving just 9.8% of total subsidies, whereas the richest segment was availing 32.1% of them, according to the World Bank.
Now the poorest class is availing 28% of the subsidies while the richest people are receiving 4.9% of them.
The World Bank underlined that Pakistan did not have much space to cut its expenditures since 70% of them were rigid in nature and being incurred on employees, pensions, operating expenses and interest.
There is not much room available to reduce rigid expenses unless deeper reforms are introduced like withdrawal of untargeted subsidies.
The World Bank has also pointed fingers towards sales tax exemptions being given to affluent groups that were heavily costing the compliant taxpayers.
In 2019, the GST collection was equal to 3.3% of the GDP.
The potential of the GST collection was nearly 4% provided tax exemptions were withdrawn.
However, the elephant in the room was the GST registration exemption threshold that the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) maintains to register traders, who are above this Rs5 million annual turnover limit.
If the Rs5 million GST registration threshold is removed, the collection potential will jump to 6.53% of the GDP, according to the World Bank.
At this year’s projected size of the economy, this will translate into Rs5.1 trillion GST collections -- indicating that Rs2 trillion are lost every year by keeping the traders outside the tax net.
The sales made by retailers below this threshold also remain outside the formal economy.
In October 2019, the traders received major concessions from the then government when it increased the exemption limit for sales tax registration for them.

2,Iran names first UAE envoy since 2016,The move comes after Iran welcomed an Emirati ambassador last September ending a six-year absence,"Iran has named an ambassador to the United Arab Emirates nearly eight years after his predecessor left, as a thaw in relations with the Gulf Arab states picks up pace.
""After some eight years, the foreign ministry has named Reza Ameri as the Islamic Republic of Iran's new ambassador to the United Arab Emirates,"" Iran's official IRNA news agency reported late Tuesday.
The move comes after Iran welcomed an Emirati ambassador last September ending a six-year absence.
The UAE had cut the level of its diplomatic representation after neighbouring Saudi Arabia severed ties in 2016 following the ransacking of its diplomatic missions in Iran by protesters angered by its execution of a leading Shiite cleric.
After several of its Gulf allies led the way, Riyadh restored diplomatic relations with Tehran last month in a fence-mending deal brokered by Beijing.
Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has accepted an invitation to Riyadh from Saudi Arabia's King Salman, First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber confirmed on Monday.
Iran and the United Arab Emirates have long had close economic ties which continued even during the diplomatic chill.
A veteran diplomat who served most recently as director general of the foreign ministry's diaspora affairs department, Ameri's career had previously taken him to Algeria, Sudan and Eritrea.

3,NSC meets today amid govt-judiciary standoff,Sources say meeting to take stock of ‘current situation’ after SC ruling on polls," 
The National Security Committee (NSC), the highest forum to discuss issues of national importance – including security, will meet on Friday (today) against the backdrop of a deepening political crisis.
There was no official word on the high-powered huddle to be chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and attended by senior cabinet ministers, services and intelligence chiefs as well as all the relevant officials.
Sources said the meeting would take stock of the “current situation”, particularly after the Supreme Court ruling that directed the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to hold elections in Punjab on May 14.
The government, in an unusual move, rejected the Supreme Court’s decision terming it a “minority verdict” while the National Assembly on Thursday passed a resolution against the top court.
The lower house of parliament urged the government and the premier not to obey the apex court orders as it was a “minority verdict”.
But despite the government's reservations, the ECP already announced a schedule for the elections in Punjab in line with the Supreme Court’s verdict.
Read PM urges SC to review its decision on Punjab poll, constitute full bench
The key issue, however, remained whether the government would spare the army troops and financial resources for the election exercise in the largest province of the country.
The defence secretary during the apex court proceedings submitted a classified report about the security situation in the country.
When the election commission had earlier postponed polls till October, it cited reluctance by the army to provide troops for the election duties as one of the reasons behind the delay.
Observers believed that the outcome of the NSC meeting would decide whether elections would take place in Punjab on May 14 or not.
The NSC meeting would also be keenly followed for its indication whether the military leadership would endorse the government’s move to confront the Supreme Court.
Some observers believed that the fact that the NSC meeting was being called at this crucial juncture showed that the security establishment was supporting the government’s view.
PTI Chairman Imran Khan smelled a rat in the government’s move to convene the NSC meeting, saying that it would use “security as a pretext” to justify postponement of the elections.
The former premier said the “imported government-convened NSC” would expose the armed forces not only to the judiciary but directly to the nation.
Imran maintained that now a meeting of the NSC had been called to try to postpone the elections and use security as a justification.
He said it was now clear that the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) wanted to avoid the elections in any case.
The PTI chairman went on to say that the PDM government introduced an unconstitutional law regarding the Supreme Court and passed a resolution against the judiciary in the National Assembly.

4,Bill in NA to grant more powers to NAB chief,Legislation aims at amending 17 sections of NAO-1999,"The government on Wednesday introduced a bill in the National Assembly to further amend the country’s accountability law, aimed at empowering the chief of the country’s top anti-graft body.
The move came as an interim official report in February revealed that in an International Monetary Fund (IMF)-conditioned review of Pakistan’s anti-corruption framework, the government had agreed to introduce more amendments to the National Accountability Ordinance and the Federal Investigation Act.
The report was submitted to the IMF as part of the global lender’s condition to conduct a comprehensive review of the institutional framework of Pakistan’s anti-graft environment by a taskforce.
The taskforce has recommended amendments to the NAO, 1999 and the FIA Act, 1974, according to the interim report. The IMF slapped the condition last year after the government made changes in the NAO that equally benefitted the politicians as well as the bureaucrats.
Law and Justice Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar tabled the National Accountability (Amendment) Bill, 2023, which seeks changes in 17 sections of the original law.
The amendments would be applicable to the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO), 1999.
Under the proposed bill, the government wants to increase the powers of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) chairperson.
All pending inquiries intended to be transferred under sub-section 3 shall be considered by the NAB chief.
Under the proposed amendments, the  NAB chairperson will have the authority to close the inquiries started under any other law.
The anti-graft body chief shall be authorised to refer all such inquiries to the related agency, institution or authority.
If NAB is not satisfied with the inquiry, its chief will be authorised to send the case to the court concerned for the approval for the release of the suspect.
On receiving the inquiry from the NAB chief, the concerned agency, authority or department will be authorised to further investigate the matter under clauses A and B.
Under the proposed amendments, if the court is not satisfied, any case can be referred back to the relevant institutions, agencies or authorities with the help of NAB.
On the return of a case from the court, NAB will be able to prosecute it under its own rules through the concerned department or authority.
Cases decided before the National Accountability Amendment Acts 2022 and 2023 will remain in force.
These decisions will remain in effect until they are withdrawn.
Any court forum or agency shall be competent under its respective laws to record or re-record old or new witnesses for further proceedings in a case referred to it.
Under Section 5 of the NAB Act, further proceedings in all pending inquiries, investigations and trials can only be conducted under the rules of the concerned institutions.
In case of absence of the NAB chief or inability to perform their duties because of any reason, their deputy will be authorised to take over their responsibilities.
In case the deputy chairperson is unavailable, the federal government will be authorised to appoint the acting NAB chief from among the senior officers of the anti-graft body.
In June last year, the NAB (Second Amendment) Bill 2021 was passed by a joint sitting of parliament.
It stripped NAB of its powers to act on federal, provincial or local tax matters. Regulatory bodies were also removed from the anti-graft body’s domain.
The bill was returned unsigned by President Arif Alvi before it became the law.
The PTI approached the Supreme Court against the bill, with its chief Imran Khan arguing that the amendments would pave the way for public office-holders to remain unpunished for white-collar crimes.
Just a month later in July 2022, the federal cabinet passed the National Accountability (Third Amendment) Bill, 2022, with new legislation aimed at restricting NAB's role in graft cases involving more than Rs500 million and taking away the president's power to appoint accountability court judges.
