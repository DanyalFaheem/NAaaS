1,"Man guns down wife, mother-in-law’",Suspicion over woman’s behaviour led to killings,"A woman, Abida, and her mother were shot dead allegedly in the name of honour in the area of Shergarh Police Station. 
The police arrested the suspect, who happened to be the slain woman’s husband, and his father. 
A case had been registered by the Shergarh Police Station on the complaint of slain Abida's aunt.
According to DPO Mansoor Aman, the police received information that two women had been shot dead in 23/D area of Shergarh. 
ASP Munnaza Karamat, along with a heavy contingent of police, was dispatched to the crime scene to get a first-hand account of what had transpired.
According to the FIR, the women had been murdered due to a property dispute, but SHO Hakim Jahanzaib said that police’s initial investigations showed that the women were allegedly killed in the name of honour.
Police said that Abida had married Arshad who worked as a security guard. They had had three children.
They said Arshad and Abida both worked in Lahore. 
Arshad somehow began suspecting his wife of having an affair. With the passage of time he became more and more paranoid. Until he could take it no more, he decided to send Abida back to the village. 
Complying with her husband’s wishes, Abida went back to the village and started living with her stepmother, Ashran Bibi.
Meanwhile, Arshad learnt from a source that his wife was still “having an illicit relationship with someone” and his mother-in-law fully supported Abida. 
Police said that this was the motive that prompted Arshad to allegedly kill his wife “in the name of honour” while she had been busy working in the fields. 
Later, he also allegedly killed his mother-in-law Ashran Bibi and escaped.
DPO Mansoor Aman took notice of the killing of the two women and formed a team headed by the ASP of Renala Khurd, Munnaza Karamat. 
On the instructions of ASP Munnaza Karamat, the SHO of Shergarh, Jahanzaib Hakim, along with a police party, managed to track down the suspect and arrested him along with his father. 
The police registered a case against Arshad, his father and a person named Riaz on the complaint of Kaneez Bibi, an aunt of slain Abida. 
Police handed over the bodies of the two women to their heirs after postmortem. 
In the month of February this year, a youth and his teenage cousin, who had fled to Karachi to get married but were duped by the girl’s family to return to their hometown Okara, were killed separately allegedly by the girl’s family in the name of honour, police had said.
Police had alleged that the girl’s father and brothers first killed the boy and then two days later they also killed their girl. 
Police said that the youth’s body had been thrown into a canal.
The DPO had taken notice of the incident and ordered the SHO of Sadar Police Station, Maher Ismail, to open investigations into the case. 
DPO Mansoor Aman had told The Express Tribune that the accused, Haider, had allegedly confessed to killing his nephew, Sabir. 
Police quoted the accused as having told them that he had thrown Sabir’s body into a canal.
Police, while giving details of the incident of honour killing, said that the 15-year-old girl, a resident of Chak No 4/1, had fallen in love with her cousin, Sabir, who was 10 years senior to her. Sabir, too, had been interested in his cousin.
They had escaped to Karachi to get married. The girl’s father somehow learnt about their being in Karachi. He, along with his sons, went to Karachi and asked his daughter and nephew that they had no objection over their wanting to get married and that they should accompany them back to their hometown.
The youth and his teenage cousin fell for it and accompanied their kin back to their hometown, not having an inkling of what their kin had planned for them.

6,MS removed after YDA protest,Action taken in light of recommendations of committee formed over death of lady doctor,"The Punjab government has transferred the Lady Willingdon Hospital medical superintendent (MS) after protest by the Young Doctors Association (YDA) over the death of a lady doctor in a hostel.
A committee formed by the provincial government advised the MS after an inquiry to report to the specialised healthcare and medical education department for further orders.
On the other hand, the family of the deceased reportedly declined to pursue legal action, saying she had died due to natural causes. It also opposed the postmortem.
The inquiry committee formed by the Punjab government to look into the death of Lady Doctor Naseeem Ejaz in the hospital's hostel last week issued a notification on Wednesday of transferring MS Dr Sabahat Habib with immediate effect and asking her to report to the department. 
After the death Dr Ejaz, a resident of Gilgit-Baltistan, the YDA along with the Young Nurses Association had started protest against the MS and also allegedly attacked her office. 
The YDA closed the outpatient departments (OPD) of the hospital, launched daily protest and also levelled allegations against the MS in a press conference. 
The association's representatives demanded action against the MS, accusing her of being responsible for the death of the doctor. 
They warned the government of protest across the province if stern action was not taken against the MS. 
The Punjab government formed the inquiry committee under the supervision of senior officials of the specialised healthcare department after the YDA protest.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Dr Sabahat Habib said the lady doctor was on leave and had died in her hostel room. According to her family, she was suffering from a heart problem. 
""Her family members did not protest or say anything but it is disheartening that some elements resorted to propaganda and also misbehaved with me after barging into my office,"" she lamented. She said the inquiry committee had not mentioned her mistake in the notification.
She asked how the health system would be run if the MS was replaced on the pressure of some elements. She said pressure groups had forced her to leave the charge over false allegations.
A leader of the Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) said the government had transferred the MS on the pressure of the YDA, although the family of the deceased was saying that her death was natural and stated before a magistrate that it did not want any legal action.
He said no wrongdoing by the MS had been mentioned in the notification, nor any reason for the action explained. He said such moves would make it difficult for anyone serving as MS to run a hospital in the presence of pressure groups.
The PMA office-bearer said the doctors would contact the provincial secretary concerned to ascertain the reason of the action against the MS who had not been declared guilty.
Time and again Young Doctors Association have been protesting and boycotting OPDs to press the authorities for their demands.
On April1, the YDA lamented that around a week has passed but no one was held accountable for the mysterious death of a lady doctor at the Lady Willingdon Hospital.
Talking to the media, the YDA leaders said neither the inquiry report in this regard was made public nor the senior medics of the hospital were punished.
Giving an ultimatum of 48 hours, they warned to extend the scope of their agitation to other hospitals of the provincial capital if their demands were not addressed during the given time.

7,Court quashes plea against JIT probing PTI cases,JIT was constituted by Punjab govt for probing cases against PTI leaders for allegedly attacking police at Zaman Park,"The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Wednesday declined a plea to stop the joint investigation team (JIT), constituted by the Punjab government to probe cases against Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leadership and workers, from work.
The division bench comprising Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh and Justice Farooq Haider heard the petition filed by PTI leader Mussarat Jamshed Cheema challenging the formation of the JIT.
The petitioner's counsel argued before the court that a JIT had been constituted to investigate 10 cases registered against PTI leadership and workers for allegedly attacking police and creating law and order situation outside party chairman Imran Khan's Zaman Park residence.
He submitted that the JIT was constituted illegally. He pleaded with the court to set aside the notification for formation of the JIT.
However, a provincial law officer contended that the JIT was constituted for transparent investigation of the cases and representatives of all relevant departments were part of it.

8,PTI moves LHC to stop postings of 22 officers,'ECP failed to act in accordance with law and Constitution',"Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Wednesday approached the Lahore High Court (LHC) seeking directions to quarters concerned to restrain postings of 22 officers in Punjab until the forthcoming general elections in the province are held and formation of the government is completed.
The petition was filed by PTI senior leader Fawad Chaudhry who made respondents the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) through its secretary, the federation of Pakistan through its secretary establishment division, the province of Punjab through its chief secretary, the government of Punjab through secretary to government and Inspector General Police (IGP) Punjab.
Fawad in his petition contended the court that the petitioner’s political party is inter-alia aggrieved of the failure of the ECP and other respondents to ensure redressal of grievance raised by the present petitioner through its application wherein the ECP, on January 25, was addressed expressing serious concerns about 22 senior government officers (11 PAS/PMS Officers and 11 officers of the Police Service) and also requested that such officers should not be given postings in the province, during the forthcoming elections for the provincial assembly.
He told the court the brief facts leading to filing this petition contending that on January 12, 2022, the then chief minister Punjab, in the exercise of his powers under Article 112 of the Constitution, advised the governor of Punjab to dissolve the provincial assembly and ultimately, the Punjab Assembly stood dissolved on January 14, where after, the caretaker chief minister Punjab was appointed who assumed office on January 22, 2022.
As the elections were due to be held within a period of 90 days from the dissolution of the assembly, therefore, the present petitioner promptly expressed its serious concerns before the ECP about the twenty-two senior government officers and also requested that such officers should not be given postings in the province during the election period.
However, the ECP miserably failed to act in accordance with law and the Constitution and granted a free hand to the controversial caretaker government to issue blanket orders of transfer and postings throughout the province, the petition stated.
“Therefore, soon after the assumption of office by the caretaker government, the political opponents of the last political government, started exerting their political influence to procure large scale postings and transfer orders to get posted their favourites on important posts, especially on the posts which could materially affect the conduct of fair and free elections” the petition furthered.
The petitioner added that not only most of the said officers were given postings against the most important posts in Punjab, which could be used to materially affect the forthcoming elections, but even the ECP approved all such transfers and postings of the controversial officers, despite the present petitioner’s specific objections raised against the said officers.
The petitioner also requested the court to pass directions to all the respondents, to ensure that such government officers, against whom any political party expresses its reservations regarding any likelihood of materially affecting the forthcoming elections, should not be posted in Punjab and be forthwith removed from his post and substituted with some other honest and impartial officer of good repute until the elections are held and the process of formation of government is completed, the petition concluded.
