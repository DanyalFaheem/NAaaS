1,"Plan afoot to prevent forced, child marriages",Desks to be set up in protection centre for girls under threat,"The Punjab police have decided to further empower the protection centre to prevent incidents of forced and child marriages.
The “Punjab Police Women Safety App” will also be upgraded to provide immediate protection to female victims in highly sensitive cases.
Special desks will be set up in the protection centre to protect girls who have been victims of child marriage or are feeling threatened.
A senior police officer, on the condition of anonymity, told The Express Tribune that the most modern and important pilot project of Punjab Police will be started from the garrison city for which a separate desk will be set up in the already established protection centre.
Whereas in the most sensitive cases, special features will be added to the Punjab Police Women Safety App to provide immediate relief and protection to the female victims of child marriage. 
With the new features of the smart mobile app, the fear of being affected by forced marriage will also be reported, enabling the police to reach the spot immediately on the complaint received.
In order to better handle the sensitive matter, it will be kept between the protection centre and the girl victim and as soon as the matter progresses to a police case at the level of inquiry, the concerned police station will be taken on board for legal action.
The police officer said that after reporting the matter, an initial investigation will be conducted by a female police officer, while the social welfare department and other institutions will also be taken on board to ensure the protection of the affected girls so that they can be assisted in all the stages of justice.
The police officer said that two cases of child marriage had been reported in Rawalpindi in the last three years following which legal action was taken.
Top police officers believe that if the reporting of this issue is made easy with the use of modern technology, such incidents can be tackled promptly.
The police officer said that the added feature against cases of child marriage will increase the effectiveness of police protection centres and the Punjab Police Women Safety App.
“If the experiment remains successful, the project will be spread throughout Punjab in the next six months so that such incidents can be prevented in South Punjab and other developed districts as well and such girls can be protected,” he said.

4,Rate of women’s combed-out hair goes up,Collectors say good quality hair fetch high prices in global market,"Though seem strange and unorthodox, the rate of women’s combed-out hair has increased exponentially in the local market.
Collectors and buyers said that good quality fallen hair fetches a high price in the global beauty market and it was a valuable source of earning for them. The combed-out hair are mainly exported to China, where it is primarily used for making wigs.
Buyers and sellers said that the rate of women’s hair has increased from Rs7,000 per kilogram to Rs9,000 per kg.
Buyers walk around the streets and neighborhoods to buy the hair before selling them to wholesale dealers in Rawalpindi for Rs9,000 per kg.
The buyers said that they earn a handsome amount by selling the fallen hair to China, where they are used to making wigs for women and men.
A wholesale dealer, Yasir Raja, told The Express Tribune that women’s combed-out hair was being exported to China for the last seven years from Rawalpindi.
“We only buy women’s hair but we prefer hair that falls out while brushing, as it makes the best quality wigs. We are always on the lookout for good quality hair,” he said adding that wigs made of root hair are in high demand in Europe, the US and the Gulf counties.
He said that a wig made from Rs9,000 per kg hair is sold for up to Rs50,000. The wholesale dealer said that they also buy the hair from beauty salons.
Some primary buyers said they do not collect hair from beauty parlours or salons, as it was useless for them. They said that naturally fallen-out hair was in high demand and it constitutes their bread and butter.
People involved in the business said that it was becoming more popular over time as now women, who used to dispose of hair, now prefer to save it and sell it to vendors.

7,Pre-urban planning of two Pindi tehsils completed,Planning report of other tehsils will be submitted to RDA in May,"In the first phase of determining the new urban boundaries of Rawalpindi district for the next 25 years, pre-urban planning of Gujar Khan and Kotli Sattian has been completed and objections have been sought from the citizens.
The planning report of other tehsils of the district for the next 25 years will be submitted to the Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) by consultant Mott MacDonald in the last week of May.
Determining the urban limits in all the tehsils of the district will help in estimating the extent of residential, commercial and open areas required by the people living in the urban limits for the next 25 years.
By determining this matter, planning for the needs of the expected growing population based on urban and rural areas will be possible. With this, due to the lack of planning on the determination of urban and rural boundaries, the unsettled problems being faced by the citizens at present will also be resolved.
According to RDA’s chief planner Jamshed Aftab, the authority has decided to launch an awareness campaign regarding the determination of new urban boundaries of the district.
On the instructions of RDA Director General, Muhammad Saif Anwar Jappa, the services of Mott MacDonald Pakistan have been hired to create awareness about the new determination of urban limits (Pre-Urban Structure Plan and Site Development Zone).
The boundaries are being determined with the help of this company for the next 25 years in which different types of zones are proposed such as green zone, residential zone, industrial zone and agro-farm zone etc.
The chief planner said that the RDA has prepared 25-year planning documents in collaboration with the local government regarding the Rawalpindi Master Plan, which includes areas of four tehsils of Gujar Khan, Kallar Syedan, Taxila and Kahuta, housing schemes, industrial areas, the central business and other places.
He said that housing societies and industrial areas would not be built outside the site development zone and added that as per the directives of the government, the areas outside the site development zones would be for agriculture and the environment.
Aftab said that meetings were held with all the stakeholders in the tehsils and later copies of the proposed maps were given to the assistant commissioners of the four tehsils so that they interact with the local stakeholders and the public and it has been suggested to display them in the tehsil offices. “The pre-urban structure plan has been uploaded on the RDA’s website,” he said

9,"‘Public, private sectors flout minimum wage law’",Top official says even parliament’s cafeteria failed to implement minimum salary,"Parliamentary Secretary for Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development (OPHRD) Syed Agha Rafiullah on Wednesday informed the National Assembly (NA) that the minimum wage set by the federal government was not being implemented in letter and spirit by the public and private sectors alike.
The minister lamented that even the Parliament’s cafeteria was dodging policies regarding the minimum wage policy.
He made these remarks while raising a query during the question hour session on behalf of MNA Jam Abdul Karim Bijar, about the fact that many government institutions that were even registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) did not pay minimum wages set by the government. Agha Rafiullah said the staff at the Parliament’s cafeteria were being paid Rs18,000 per month. He added that there was no implementation of the minimum wage set by the government that should be taken to task by the NA. He demanded that the speaker should give a ruling to the NA’s Committee on Finance seeking a report on the implementation of a minimum wage of Rs25,000 set by the government in all the public departments including defense-related entities. Raja Pervez Ashraf gave the ruling that the finance committee should seek a report on minimum wage and take measures for its implementation at the federal level.
Moulana Abdul Akbar Chitrali of MMAP also pointed out that a delegation of lecturers serving in the model colleges of the federal capital on a contractual basis met and informed him that they were paid Rs20,000 per month whereas they were MPhil qualified.
Chitrali said it is highly deplorable that such highly qualified teachers were earning such a low income. “At least they shall be paid a minimum wage of Rs40,000 to Rs50,000.”
Minister of State for Finance and Revenue Dr Aisha Ghaus Pasha responded that the issue was related more to the provincial departments that were responsible to ensure minimum wage implementation in the public and private sectors.
“This is a matter related to provincial governments, however, if minister Rafiullah has specific examples involving a federal entity, then he should share them so that they could be sent to the relevant committee,” she added. However, the speakers on the occasion interjected that the committee should ensure the minimum wage implementation at least at the federal level. Referring to MNA Chitrali’s question, she said the member’s query would be shared with the NA Committee on Education so that it could address the matter.
