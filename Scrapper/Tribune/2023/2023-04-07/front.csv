0,NA resolution rejecting SC poll order: An exercise in futility,Legal eagles say document has no legal worth,"The National Assembly has passed a resolution against the Supreme Court’s April 4 verdict. However, the real threat to the apex court comes from within.
A senior lawyer, who is closely watching the ongoing situation, said sanity must prevail now. He also urged retired judges and senior lawyers who have good reputation to play their roles to end the division within the Supreme Court.
""After learning about their future plans, I have decided to contact ex-chief justices Tassaduq Hussian Jilani and Nasirul Mulk and senior lawyers like Hamid Khan and Muneer A Malik to play their roles in easing the tension between the two sections of the apex court,"" he said while requesting anonymity.
“However, both sides will be a loser, if the situation persists,” he warned. Since filing of a reference against senior SC judge Qazi Faez Isa, the apex court has been divided into two ideological camps. The differences among them have widened in the last couple of weeks as both these sections of judges have passed judicial orders to annul each other’s opinions.
Now judicial politics has already converted into a ‘judicial war' which is now entering its final round in which both sides, some experts believe, can go to any extent for their survival.
It is learnt that a complaint is being filed against Justice Qazi Faez Isa this week in the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC), the legal forum that can hold judges of superior courts accountable.
Justice Isa and Justice Sardar Tariq Masood have already written to the SJC members to initiate proceedings on the complaints filed against Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi.
Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial has already disclosed his views on those complaints by doubting evidence against Justice Naqvi.
One section of the government is also pushing for filing presidential references against the three SC judges including CJP Bandial who on April 4 directed the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to hold elections for the Punjab Assembly on May 14.
However, some senior lawyers agree that CJP Bandial should take some practical steps to end mistrust among fellow judges.
The NA resolution
Commenting on the National Assembly’s Thursday resolution, a lawyer said it has no legal worth and yet it will cause anguish for a section of judges.
Former additional attorney general Tariq Mahmood Khokhar said the NA resolution is of no constitutional or legal consequence.  It cannot overrule or dilute the SC order.
“It is a futile attempt on part of the legislature to encroach upon the domain of the judiciary. Parliament cannot even discuss the conduct of a superior court judge in the discharge of his duties.""
Khokhar said it is a mere resolution and not a legislative overruling.
""In the instant case, the SC’s constitutional ruling is final which can be altered only by a constitutional amendment or by a new ruling of the SC,” he said.
Commenting on the present situation, Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad said it is very unfortunate that despite clear constitutional provisions these important institutions are standing at a crossroads.
“This is not at all in the interest of the country and democracy.”
He said it is also unprecedented in the history of the National Assembly that a resolution is passed against a judgment of the Supreme Court.
“This resolution signed by 42 MNAs might have no legal effect on the recent judgment but it has undermined the image of both the parliament and the judiciary, which is not in the larger interest of the country.”
He said as per Article 121 of the Constitution the conduct of a superior court judge with reference to discharge of his or her duties could not be discussed on the floor of the house.
“A complaint against a judge can only be routed through the president who refers it to the Supreme Judicial Council under Article 209 of the Constitution,” he added.
Ahsaan said there is an immediate need that all the points which have been repeatedly agitated by the bar councils at different occasions –-like invoking Article 184( 3) of the Constitution, the process of  appointment of judges to superior courts and reforms for early dispensation of justice-- should be addressed immediately on priority through full court proceeding as “this is the best forum to agitate and address all the points”.
He said the Supreme Court Rules 1980 had been made in pursuance of Article 191 of the Constitution through full court proceedings.
“Under Order 11 of the rule constitution of benches, fixation of cases and conducting the proceedings under Article 184(3) of Constitution in suo motu proceedings are the undeniable power and prerogative of the chief justice,” he said.

1,Dar pulls out of WB-IMF spring meetings,"Cites deepening political uncertainty, developing judicial crisis in country as reasons","In a major development, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar has cancelled his visit to the United States where he was scheduled to meet the International Monetary Fund management for the removal of bottlenecks in the way of the staff-level agreement regarding the revival of the stalled bailout package.
Highly placed sources told The Express Tribune that Dar would not attend the spring meetings of the World Bank-IMF that were taking place from April 10 to 16 in Washington. Dar, who is also leader of the house in Senate, was planning to land in Washington on Sunday.
“I am not going due to the domestic state of affairs,” the finance minister confirmed to The Express Tribune on Thursday.
The deepening political uncertainty and developing judicial crisis were said to be the reasons behind the cancellation of the trip to Washington. Dar had a plan to address the financial and political worlds’ concerns regarding the continuity of the government, future economic plans and bridging the once again trust deficit with the multilateral lenders.
The sources said that Minister for Economic Affairs Sardar Ayaz Sadiq would also not go to the United States due to the prevailing uncertain political conditions. The economic affairs minister always represented Pakistan at the World Bank. Ayaz was considered very close to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and also handled the political affairs of the allied parties.
The finance minister’s decision to pull out might also lead to cancellation of meetings with his Saudi Arabia counterpart, and the UK state minister for development.
Finance Secretary Hamed Yaqoob Sheikh and Economic Affairs Secretary Kazim Niaz would represent the government at the WB-IMF spring meetings.
A secretary was considered equal to a deputy minister and they might still be able to meet some of the high-ranking foreign officials.
Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Finance Tariq Bajwa might replace Dar. However, the sources said that due to diplomatic protocol issues, the PM’s special assistant was lower in rank and might not be able to meet with the presidents of various multilateral institutions and finance ministers of different countries.
Dar had scheduled meetings with the presidents of WB, Asian Development Bank and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank – the three multilateral creditors that were very crucial for Pakistan’s plans to raise $6 billion in additional loans to meet the last IMF condition.
Dar had a confirmed meeting with IMF Deputy Managing Director Antoinette Monsio Sayeh next Thursday but Managing Director Ms Kristalina Georgieva did not give time for the meeting.
In a conversation with The Express Tribune on Thursday, IMF Resident Representative Esther Perez said, “The Pakistan delegation will have a high-level meeting during the spring meetings with IMF’s deputy managing director Ms Sayeh, who follows Pakistan closely.”
Dar was scheduled to begin his trip with an opening meeting with the IMF’s Mission Chief to Pakistan, Nathan Porter, on Monday. The meeting was crucial since Pakistan and the IMF were no more actively negotiating after the government’s sudden fiscally irresponsible move of announcing petrol subsidies.
Although the government claimed that the petrol subsidy would not affect the budget, the plan did not apparently guarantee that.
The sources said that Janet Yellen, the treasury secretary, also had not given an appointment, nor did Waly Adeyemo, the treasury deputy secretary.
Similarly, Samantha Power, the USAID administrator, was also not available for the meeting but a meeting had been scheduled with the assistant administrator of the USAID to South Asia.
Jihad Azour, the director of Middle East and Central Asia Department of the IMF, was also scheduled to meet the finance minister.
The sources said that a meeting had also been planned with the IMF fiscal affairs department aimed at discussing issues like a whopping Rs276 billion shortfall in tax collection during the first nine months of the fiscal year.
The finance minister was also set to meet with the representatives of the three international credit rating agencies that had downgraded Pakistan, which had temporarily closed down the doors for borrowings from international capital markets.
The finance ministry had also lined up meetings with the representatives of the foreign commercial banks aimed at convincing them to provide commercial loans to meet the external financing requirements.
Some of these meetings might still take place.

2,Justice Minallah wades into suo motu row,Judge says SC suo motu in poll delay case was dismissed 4-3,"In another twist to the political and legal debate over the controversy surrounding the case regarding delay in holding elections in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Justice Athar Minallah on Friday released his dissenting note, confirming that the Supreme Court’s suo motu was dismissed 4-3.
In February, Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial had formed a nine-judge bench -- comprising himself, Justice Ijazul Ahsan, Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Munib Akhtar, Justice Yahya Afridi, Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Minallah -- to hear the case.
However, Justice Ahsan and Justice Naqvi had recused themselves as questions were raised on their presence on the bench.
Two more judges, Justice Afridi and Justice Minallah were said to have disassociated themselves from the proceedings as they expressed their opinion on the maintainability of the petitions on the matter.
The CJP then reconstituted a five-judge bench, which on March 1 issued a split 3-2 verdict, empowering President Arif Alvi to announce the date of the Punjab elections, while directing the K-P governor to set the polls date for the provincial assembly in consultation with the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
CJP Bandial, Justice Akhtar and Justice Mazhar supported the verdict, while Justice Mandokhail and Justice Shah dissented by opposing the admissibility of the suo moto case.
Justice Mandokhail and Justice Shah, in a joint dissent note, maintained that the suo motu proceedings initiated by the CJP were “wholly unjustified” and initiated with “undue haste”.
They pointed out that Justice Ahsan and Justice Naqvi had not been removed from the bench but had voluntarily recused themselves.
They continued that the failure to count the decisions of Justice Afridi and Justice Minallah would amount to excluding them from the bench without their consent, which was not permissible under the law and not within the powers of the CJP.
“Therefore, we are of the opinion that the dismissal of the present suo motu proceedings and the connected constitution petitions is the order of the court by a majority of 4 to 3 of the seven-member bench,” the joint note read.
Justice Minallah’s note released on Friday stated that he had read the detailed reasoning of Justice Shah and Justive Mandokhail and he “agrees with their opinion, particularly regarding the final outcome of the petitions and the suo motu assumption of jurisdiction by a majority of 4 to 3 because this was the understanding in the meeting held in the anteroom on February 27.”
“It is noted that I had [neither] recused, nor had any reason to dissociate myself [from the case],” he wrote in a 23-page note, dismissing the suo motu case.
The SC judge maintained that “the manner and mode in which these proceedings were initiated have unnecessarily exposed the court to political controversies”.
“It has invited objections from political stakeholders in an already polarised political environment. The objections have also been submitted in writing. This obviously has consequences for the trust the people ought to repose in the impartiality of the court,” he wrote.
“The court, by proceeding in a premature matter, will be stepping into already murky waters of the domain of politics. It is likely to erode public confidence,” the note added.
“The assumption of suo motu jurisdiction in itself may raise concerns in the mind of an informed outside observer. In the circumstances, the rights of litigants whose cases are pending before us would be prejudiced, besides eroding public trust in the independence and impartiality of the court. This could have been avoided if a full court was to take up these cases. It would have ensured the legitimacy of the proceedings,” Justice Minallah observed.
The SC judge also raised serious questions over the dissolution of the Punjab Assembly by the PTI, noting that the court “cannot and must not appear or be seen as advancing the political strategies of political stakeholders”.
“The dissolution of the provincial legislature as part of the political strategy of the stakeholders raises questions. Is such conduct in consonance with the scheme of constitutional democracy? Is it not in itself a violation of the Constitution? Should this court allow its forum to be exploited for advancing political strategies or appear to be encouraging undemocratic conduct? Should this court not take notice of forum shopping by political stakeholders by invoking the jurisdictions of high courts and this court simultaneously?” the judge’s note continued.
Justice Minallah observed that public trust would be eroded in the independence and impartiality of the court if it appeared or was seen to encourage undemocratic norms and values.
“The court would be unwittingly weakening the Majlis-e-Shoora (parliament) and the forums created under the Constitution by encouraging political stakeholders to add their disputes to our dockets,” he added.
“The political stakeholders must establish their bona fides before their petitions could be entertained. The conduct of the stakeholders has created an unprecedented political instability by resorting to conduct that is devoid of the democratic values of tolerance, dialogue and debate,” the judge observed.
Justice Minallah continued that the  conduct of the stakeholders did not entitle them to invoke the jurisdiction of the court under Article 184-3 of the Constitution lest it was seen or appeared to facilitate or promote undemocratic values and strategies.
“It is ironic and unimaginable for the political stakeholders to involve the court in resolving political disputes, which ought to have been settled in the forums created for this purpose under the constitution,” he noted.
Reflecting on the apex court’s history, Justice Minallah highlighted the uncomfortable fact that the SC had in the past engaged in activity unbecoming of an institution of its stature.
“The long spells of undemocratic regimes validated by this court have caused irretrievable loss to the country and its people. The institutions which represent the will of the people were not allowed to take root. Even today, 75 years after the creation of Pakistan, the institutions remain weak,” the judge lamented.
Justice Minallah observed that the country was on the brink of political as well as constitutional crises and it was high time that all those responsible resorted to some introspection.
He continued that all the institutions, including this court, needed to set aside their egos and strive towards fulfilling their constitutional obligations.
“Speaking for my institution, it is obvious that we may not have learnt any lessons from our past bleak history. We cannot erase the judgments from the law reports but at least endeavour to restore public trust and confidence so that the past is forgotten to some extent. When politicians do not approach the appropriate forums and bring their disputes to the courts, the former may win or lose the case, but inevitably the court is the loser,” he observed.
Justice Minallah highlighted that the political crisis had “escalated when, after losing the vote of confidence, [PTI Chairman] Mr Imran Khan chose not to take the exalted seat of leader of the opposition and decided to resign from the membership of the National Assembly along with other members belonging to the PTI”.
“The resignations were tendered but their acceptance by the speaker was delayed. The strategy had profound consequences for the political process and constitutional democracy of Pakistan,” he added.
“As a political strategy, resignations en masse were tendered from the National Assembly, rather than discharging their constitutional obligations as members of the opposition. The constitutional courts were first approached to compel the speaker to accept the resignations and when they were accepted the courts were again approached to have the decision reversed,” Justice Minallah noted.
Commenting on the SC majority decision on the interpretation of Article 63-A of the Constitution, the judge noted that “the political ramifications of this declaration were profound in a highly charged and polarised political atmosphere. A review against the judgment was sought and the petitions are pending before this court”.
Justice Minallah regretted that the apex court “exercised jurisdiction under Article 184-3 to legitimise the removal of elected prime ministers and endorse military takeovers”.
The judge regretted that the framers of the Constitution had inserted Article 184-3 in it intending that the jurisdiction shall be exercised to ensure that the fundamental rights of the weak, vulnerable and marginalised classes were protected.
“This court handed down the judgment in Begum Nusrat Bhutto v. Chief of Army Staff and Federation of Pakistan (PLD 1977 SC 657) to validate the imposition of martial law, based on the doctrine of necessity, while exercising its original jurisdiction and it lasted for a decade despite the timeframe committed to it,” he added.
“The deposed prime minister [Zulfikar Ali Bhutto] was convicted and sent to the gallows after his appeal was dismissed by this court by a majority of 4 to 3. During the trial the appellant had filed an application because he had reservations on the constitution of the bench,” Justice Minallah observed.

3,Govt demands CJ Bandial to step down,Justice Minallah says suo motu case was previously dismissed by majority,"The ongoing tussle between the government and Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial seemed to have reached a point of no return, as the former has asked the latter to step down over the “controversial” choices he made while directing the electoral body to hold election in Punjab on May 14.
In a hard-hitting news conference against the top adjudicator and two other judges, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb demanded that the chief justice should step down as his position has become controversial, especially, after Supreme Court’s Justice Athar Minallah’s note in the Punjab poll case.
Meanwhile, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif also accused the chief justice of pushing the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s (PTI) agenda and demanded his resignation.
In a tweet, the deposed prime minister said that the courts usually take the nations out of crises instead of pushing them into one. He also wondered about the powers the CJP exercised to impose a minority judgment on a majority decision.
Nawaz, while demanding the resignation of chief justice, wrote that Justice Bandial, who is “pushing the agenda of PTI while insulting his position as well as the constitution”, should resign immediately instead of causing further harm.
During the news conference, the government’s spokesperson said that the decision given by Justice Minallah has put a question mark on the judicial process, saying that a three-member bench led by CJP was formed on the petition that was already dismissed by four judges.
The information minister questioned why the bench was formed and why a decision came on it when there was no petition before the court, adding that how could people accept a decision the majority judges do not accept either.
The minister reiterated that political parties do not run away from elections and emphasised that the Punjab polls case issue was no longer limited to elections as it has become a matter of “bench fixing”, among other things.
Marriyum asked who would trust a decision if the constitutional crisis arises from the apex court itself. “Abuse of powers and arbitrary interpretation of the Constitution cannot be accepted,” she declared.
While referring to court proceedings, she said that the lawyers of all the political parties were present before the top court, but they were not heard, saying only those who had petitioned were heard. “Why these 13 parties were not heard?” she questioned.
The government’s demand of the CJP’s resignation has come on the heels of the National Assembly (NA) passing a resolution declaring that the “parliament rejects” a recent “minority” judgment of the apex court directing to hold polls in Punjab on May 14; bars the prime minister and the federal cabinet from implementing it; and urges the top court to form a full court to review the “rewriting” of the constitution under Article 63-A of the Constitution of Pakistan.
The lower house of the parliament, while expressing concern on the undue judicial interference in political matters, said that the recent judgment of the apex court was creating political instability in the country and paving the way for the division of the federating units. For bringing political and economic stability to the country, the ruling coalition’s resolution stated, the House considers that holding general elections at the same time throughout the country is the solution to all the prevailing problems.

4,Military op to root out terrorists on the cards,"NSC huddle approves decision as country faces economic, political crises","The National Security Committee (NSC) on Friday decided to launch a comprehensive operation against terrorists, as the country’s civil and military leadership virtually issued a charge-sheet against the previous government and the establishment for allowing the banned TTP to regroup.
The high-level huddle chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and attended by services chiefs and top intelligence officials as well as senior cabinet ministers came against the backdrop of a host of developments -- both on the political and security fronts.
All eyes were on the country’s highest forum on the national security as there were speculations that the NSC might endorse the government’s decision to reject the Supreme Court ruling on the election in Punjab.
Although there was no explicit mention of the current political tensions in the country, the NSC acknowledged the deterioration in the security situation that warranted a new comprehensive operation.
The move may help the government advance its narrative that elections under present circumstances are not possible in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.
The highlight of the NSC meeting was the decision to launch an all-out comprehensive operation against terrorist outfits. It was for the first time Pakistan was going to launch another offensive against terrorism since 2016.
A statement issued after an over four-hour long huddle by the PM office said the meeting agreed to launch “an all-out comprehensive operation with the entire nation and the government, which will rid the country of the menace of terrorism with renewed vigor and determination.”
“This comprehensive, all-round and comprehensive operation to eliminate the scourge of terrorism in all its forms from Pakistan will also include efforts at the political, diplomatic security, economic and social levels. A high-level committee has also been formed in this regard and will make recommendations regarding its implementation within two weeks,” the statement added.
Sources said unlike the past military campaigns, the latest offensive would cover all areas, including targeting those elements who use social and other media platforms to hurt Pakistan’s interests.
What was significant in Friday’s meeting was that for the first time the civil and military leadership publicly conceded that a policy to pursue peace talks with the TTP was a blunder.
The NSC linked the surge in terrorism with the previous dispensation’s policy of appeasement towards the TTP, which was completely contrary to public expectations and aspirations.
“Not only were the militants allowed to return without hindrance, but hardcore TTP terrorists were also released from jails in the name of confidence building,” the NSC noted in a reference to the PTI government’s decision to seek a peace deal with the TTP.
The committee said the returning terrorists used their contacts with groups operating out of Afghanistan to stage major attacks in Pakistan.
It was unprecedented that the military leadership char sheeted their predecessors for following a flawed policy.
The committee strongly condemned the efforts to spread foreign sponsored poisonous propaganda against state institutions and their leadership on social media under the guise of ulterior motives. Such measures, the statement noted, hurt Pakistan’s national security.
Reiterating the determination to thwart the nefarious intentions of the enemies of the country, the committee said that all possible efforts will be made to maintain the peace and security achieved after rendering great sacrifices.

5,PTI agrees to extend polls date via constitutional tweak,Qaiser makes it conditional for govt to publicly announce its readiness for talks,"PTI senior leader Asad Qaiser has expressed his party’s willingness to consider a constitutional amendment to make way for adjustments to the election schedule beyond the 90-day requirement under the law but made it conditional for the government publicly announcing its readiness to engage in negotiations.
Another senior leader of the party, Fawad Chaudhry, while speaking to the media in Lahore, claimed that he wanted the government, opposition and ‘powerful circles’ to move towards free and fair elections in Pakistan together as it was the only way forward from the current uncertainty prevailing in the country.
During an interview with a local news outlet on Wednesday, Qaiser, a former speaker of the National Assembly, stressed the need for political leaders to sit together and resolve matters through talks.

He believed that a dialogue between the government and the PTI-led opposition was the need of the hour, and that the current rulers must officially make a move for the negotiations.
PTI chairman and deposed premier Imran Khan had previously offered to talk to everyone except “thieves and looters”.
He also tweeted that he was ready to make any sacrifice for the country’s best interests, progress, and democracy.
This offer for talks from the PTI chief had come a day after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif extended an olive branch to Imran, emphasising the need for a dialogue between political forces to evade the prevailing crises faced by the country.
Qaiser maintained that the PTI was ready to confront any obstacles that might arise during the negotiations.
However, he also highlighted the importance of prioritising the country and its citizens, stressing that politics should be for the betterment of the nation and its people.
He criticised the government’s confrontational approach and stressed the need for constructive talks.
Qaiser also expressed his doubts about the government’s commitment to resolving the ongoing political crisis through constructive negotiations.
He questioned whether the government was truly interested in ending the crisis and initiating talks, stressing that the needs of Pakistan and its people must take precedence.
He continued that those in power were “far removed from sanity” and cautioned that the simmering frustration among the people was reaching a “dangerous level”, posing a significant threat to the country’s stability.
Qaiser emphasised the importance of national unity in creating an environment that was conducive to fair and transparent elections, and acceptable to all stakeholders.
He highlighted the need for the people of the country to exercise their right to choose their leaders and determine the future of the country.
The PTI leader also spoke about the importance of adhering to the law in connection with the elections date.
He argued that even a small fluctuation in the polls date must be approved according to the law to ensure that the elections were conducted in a manner that was fair and just as well as free from any objections.
Qaiser said anyone losing the polls must not raise a hue and cry over the results -- claiming that this was what his party wanted.
He criticised the ruling coalition's decision to flout court orders on the Punjab polls date, calling it unconstitutional and indicative of a government that was only focused on its own interests.
He continued that such actions eroded the government’s popularity and paved the way for its “political demise”.
Qaiser reiterated the PTI’s commitment to a fair and transparent election process, again highlighting the party’s willingness to support a constitutional amendment for the polls date extension.
He added that this demonstrated the PTI's willingness to work towards a solution that benefitted all parties involved.
PTI senior vice president Fawad Chaudhry maintained that the resolution presented in parliament earlier in the day had no constitutional or legal value.
“Only a two-thirds majority in both the upper and lower houses can nullify the Supreme Court’s verdict,” he added.
The former federal information minister claimed that resolutions could not nullify the ruling of the apex court, but PML-N Senior Vice President Maryam Nawaz was making every effort to disqualify her uncle, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
The PTI leader underscored that there was no constitutional or political crisis in the country as the Constitution was very clear that whenever an assembly was dissolved, elections would be held within 90 days.
However, he added that the government was not willing to abide by the Constitution and making efforts to evade the elections.
“The incumbent rulers are not ready to face the people of Pakistan and give them their right to vote,” he claimed.
The PTI leader warned of a mammoth movement across the country if all constitutional channels were closed.
He pointed out that the caretaker government would automatically lose its constitutional as well as legal status after April 22 and all its decisions would have no standing beyond this date.
“I believe that the apex country has already given relaxation of a week or so by setting the election schedule beyond 90 days. It is not necessary that the Supreme Court is right every time, but its decision is final and has to be accepted,” he added.
Speaking about the resolution passed by parliament, Fawad highlighted that only 42 members out of total 342 had signed it.
He asked the government and the media to provide the list of lawmakers in attendance in parliament during the last 10 days, maintaining that on one occasion, only four and on another, only eight members were present in the House.
Earlier, he pointed out that the law minister and attorney general had raised objections on the apex court’s decision about the elections in Punjab and later, the federal cabinet had rejected the SC’s verdict through a media statement.
“All cabinet members, who rejected the apex court’s verdict, are guilty of contempt,” he maintained.
Fawad advised the government that if it had any reservations over the apex court’s decision, it should file a review petition instead of attacking the SC.
“You cannot dictate the Supreme Court about the size and composition of the bench. That is the prerogative of the chief justice of Pakistan,” he continued.
Also read: PTI pledges peaceful conduct in elections
He claimed that the PTI had only one demand -- holding free and fair elections as per the Constitution within 90 days.
“It is the duty of all state institutions to protect the Constitution. If the government fails to abide by the Constitution, the PTI is ready for a major movement,” he added.
The PTI leader maintained that his party did want a conflict with any state institution.
Pointing out that the National Security Committee (NSC) meeting was scheduled for Friday (today), Fawad maintained that Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah’s claims should not be taken seriously as there was no emergency situation in the country.
