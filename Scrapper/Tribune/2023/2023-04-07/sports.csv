0,Tribal feud claims life of prominent educationist,The alleged killers released a video in which they are firing in celebration after killing Prof Ajmal,"The tribal feuds in the upper Sindh region claimed the life of a prominent educationist who had come back from France with a PhD in Artificial Intelligence (AI) to serve his people.
IBA Sukkur Computer Science Department Assistant Prof Dr Muhammad Ajmal Sawand was killed in a brazen attack by armed men of Sundrani tribe in Kandhkot-Kashmore district on Thursday.
Prof Ajmal was going back from his village in Kandhkot to Sukkur when Sundarani tribesmen attacked his vehicle with fire arms.
The district's SSP Irfan Samo told The Express Tribune that Sawand -- a doctor of philosophy (PhD) in artificial intelligence (AI) with several years of teaching experience in Paris, from where he obtained that degree in 2015 -- sustained 11 gunshot wounds.
""The attack was certainly indiscriminate and savage,"" he said. The alleged killers later released a video in which they can be seen indulging in celebratory firing after shooting dead Prof Ajmal.
According to the SSP, the apparent cause of the murder is the on-going clash between the Sawand and Sundrani tribes of Kandhkot sparked by an incident of honour killing.
The feud has so far claimed seven lives in four months since December, 2022. Four persons of Sundranis and three of Sawands have been killed. He said over two weeks ago armed men of Sawand tribe shot dead three men of Sundranis.

He believed that the killing of the professor was likely a revenge for the recent deaths. He shared that he spoke with Prof Ajmal's brother Dr Tariq Sawand on Wednesday and came to know about the professor's visit. ""I was aware of the severity of the clash. I would have provided him security if I was asked,"" the SSP said.
He quoted Tariq who told the SSP after the murder that the professor left the village for Sukkur without even taking armed men from Sawand tribe for his security.
The SSP informed that following the killing, he moved his armoured personnel carriers from an ongoing operation against the dacoits of riverine forest to the village of Sundranis. However, he added, all the suspects have escaped from the area with their families after the incident and no arrest could be made.
He said that dozens of tribal clashes claim hundreds of lives in the district every year. ""Every other home here is armed. The police can't even dare to raid a place without the armoured vehicles.""
He recalled that only three days ago an inspector was shot dead and a DSP and a constable were injured in the operation against dacoits in Kandhkot.
""They are armed with anti-aircraft guns which even pierce the body of the APCs"".
According to him, he was also trying to resolve the dispute between Sawand and Sundrani tribes by negotiation with their elders. But the effort was in the early stages.
The incident's FIR has not been lodged so far. The body was taken to Kandhkot Civil Hospital for postmortem. Tension returned to the villages of Sundranis and Sawands after the killing but the presence of the police has so far averted any reaction.
The IBA Sukkur University has condemned the killing and expressed solidarity with the family. The killing also sparked a fierce reaction on social media.
""Tribal Killing has destroyed more families than any war in Sindh,"" wrote Mehwish Khan. ""I remember when you discussed your future plans before leaving France. You preferred to serve your homeland. What have we returned to you?"" Intesab Hussain wrote.
The professor, a student of Cadet College Larkana, obtained Bachelor of Engineering degree in Software Engineering from Mehran University of Engineering and Technology, Jamshoro, in 2006.
He later acquired the postgraduate qualification from Jean Monnet University, Saint Etienne, France, in Computer Science in 2011 followed by his PhD from Paris Descartes University in 2015.
His professional research interests include security and resource management in wireless medical sensor networks, wireless body area networks, virtual sensor networks, mobile crowd sensing, quality monitoring for medical and health applications, among others.

1,Super (over) finish for women’s night cricket,Khelo Khavateen wins big with 108 registered players in local tournament,"It was down to the last ball. The lights were on and the crowd was on the edge of their seats. Or chairs and benches at the popular Kokan ground near the Sadabahar wedding hall in Bahadurabad. Underdogs BSL Women Cricket Club needed to defend eight off the last ball against reigning champions Athletic Club in a match where extras were the top scorer in both innings. 
It was the final of a woman's night cricket tournament spearheaded by 33-year-old cricket enthusiast Hadeel Obaid who works to promote cricket at the grassroots level through her digital platform Khelo Kricket. 
What started as an experiment with four teams and a handful of cricketers in 2016 saw the participation of nine teams with 108 registered players. They ranged from as young as twelve and the oldest in their mid-thirties, including a couple of moms.
The tournament started due to a dearth of opportunities for girls, and its success shows that girls want to play, says Obaid. The tournament, Khelo Khavateen, has already produced a star. National team player Fatima Sana was a regular in the earlier editions of the tournament. Another rising star is all-rounder Arijah Haseeb, who has already represented Pakistan at the U19 level.
Along the boundary and in-between matches, family members join players to help them practice. Fathers issue instructions on posture and style, mums bowl, siblings' field. While there was an air of competition, there was festivity and camaraderie in ample supply as well.
The cheering ebbed and flowed during the matches, with one spectacular catch raising decibel levels to a point where the ground administration requested the organisers to rein in the spectators. 
Urooj Mumtaz, former captain of the Pakistan Women's Cricket team continues to support the tournament. Hajra Khan, captain of the Pakistan women's football team is a regular participant and her team Disco Ninjas bring their own unique flavour to the tournament. 
Back to the final, six-time winner Athletic Club are confident of finding a way out of the situation. They are banking on yet another extra. ""Eight runs, one ball, don't worry!"" shoutouts someone from the boundary.
Someone is overheard comparing the match to the 2019 World Cup final between England and New Zealand, easily the most memorable final in living memory.
The ball is delivered and is in the right channel. The batter smacks it with all her might and it is the first maximum of the match. But no one is waiting to see where the ball lands. An explosion of joy as the BSL bench and supporters race to the ground to celebrate their victory.
For Obaid, it was the perfect finish because ‘who doesn’t love the story of an underdog’s triumph’.

2,Police widen probe into minor girl's murder,Police suspect minor killed after failed rape attempt by accomplices familiar to victim,"The police have initiated an investigation into an alleged murder of a young girl after a failed rape attempt in Surjani Town. 
The father of the victim, Mohammad Younis, filed a complaint which led to the registration of a case under sections 376 and 302/34 for rape and murder, respectively, against unknown suspects. 
The police have detained three suspects from the area and have started an investigation. However, no eyewitnesses or CCTV footage of the incident is found.
Police are of the view that the suspects knew the girl and were familiar with her, which enabled them to lure her away. Fearing the girl might identify them, they killed her and dumped her body in a sewer. 
During the incident, the girl's family was busy preparing for Iftar, leaving the street unattended, and facilitating the crime.

3,SHC rejects SSP’s report on toxic fumes deaths,Low number of post-mortems irks CJ Shaikh,"The Sindh High Court on Thursday rejected a report from a senior police officer regarding deaths caused by toxic fumes in Keamari. 
While hearing a petition on Thursday, a two-member bench, headed by SHC Chief Justice Ahmed Ali Shaikh, expressed dissatisfaction over an investigation report submitted by the senior superintendent of police (SSP) Investigation, Keamari.
The public prosecutor submitted before the bench that there were two incidents, one in Mochko and the other in Keamari. The chief justice asked, “What progress has so far been made in the investigation?”
The public prosecutor replied that it has been made mandatory to have a post-mortem examination of the deceased performed.
The chief justice asked what action has been taken against those who refused a post-mortem. “In most cases, a post-mortem has not been performed on the body. Now you will say that the policemen responsible have retired.”
Appearing before the bench, the Keamari SSP said that plastic traces had been found in the bodies of the victims.

The CCTV footage of muggers shooting 35-year-old Muhammad Hussain in Korangi on March 22 had gone viral on the social media platforms.
The suspects after snatching cash and cell phone from Hussain shot him dead even though he had put up no resistance.
Hussain's son and three daughters tried to shake the conscience of the law enforcers and society as a whole. The orphans questioned why their father was killed and who was responsible for his brutal murder? They also asked society who would take their responsibility now that their father has been taken away from them?
They said that the people around them were observing Ramazan and preparing for Eid, but they only mourn their father's death who used to fulfill their needs.

5,Sindh govt pursuing WHO’s ‘Health for All’ theme: Bilawal,PPP says public health party's top priority as it pays tribute to health professionals on World Health Day,"Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman and Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has said that bringing health facilities to the doorsteps of the people is the manifesto of his party, and the Sindh people's government has developed world-class health institutions as a bright example for other governments.
In his message issued from Media Cell Bilawal House on World Health Day, he endorsed the theme of the World Health Organisation, Health for All, saying that this slogan is also the manifesto of his party.
Bilawal stressed that a large section of population was living below the poverty line, and the people were facing historic inflation and unemployment. Under such circumstances the state has to fulfill its responsibilities regarding public health.
He paid tribute to the doctors, nurses, lady health workers and other health professionals who are working day and night to save the lives of their countrymen during the corona virus outbreak. The medical staff who sacrificed their own lives while treating the patients during the pandemic deserve a special place in our prayers, he added.
Chairman Bilawal said that public health has always been one of the top priorities of his party.
The PPP Chairman said that National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD) and its satellite network, Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation (SIUT), Pir Abdul Qadir Shah Jilani Institute of Medical Sciences Gambat, and the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center (JPMC) and its cyberknife technology unit for cancer treatment are the gifts of the PPP government to the people of the country.
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (ZABICVD), the world's largest free cardiology hospital with 1,200 beds, is also a reflection of our commitment that lack of money should not be an obstacle for any Pakistani to get the required medical treatment.

6,"Sindh, Centre to review gas distribution policy",CM seeks new policy to redress grievances of Sindh,"Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah and Federal State Minister for Petroleum Musadik Malik have agreed to revisit the gas distribution policy to redress the grievances of the province that produces over 60 per cent of the country's natural gas. 
This emerged in a meeting between Shah and Malik at the CM House on Thursday. The meeting was also attended by Provincial Energy Minister Imtiaz Shaikh, Federal Petroleum Secretary Capt (retd) Muhammad Mahoomd, Secretary to CM Raheem Shaikh, Provincial Energy Secretary Abu Bakar, Managing Director SSGC Imran Maniar, and on video link GD Gas Rasheed Johio.
The chief minister said that the total gas production of Pakistan stood at 3,358.21 MMCFD, of which Sindh contributes 62 to 63 per cent gas, or 2,100-2,200 MMCF. He added that the total demand of the province was 1,600-1,700 MMCFD. 
Shah said that the province was being supplied 1,400-1,500 MMCFD to all consumers and still gas surplus from Sindh prediction stood at 600 to 700 MMCFD. He added that gas shortage in the province has not only badly affected the industrial sector, domestic consumers are being subjective to load-shedding even during the holy month of Ramazan.
CM Shah also pointed out that the provincial government has approved 1,000 village gasification schemes which were pending with SSGCL since 2010-11. 
State Minister Malik said that the total production of gas has been recorded at 3,200 MMCFD, of which 200 MMCFD is consumed by the compressors operating at the field. ""Out of the remaining 3,000 MMCFD gas, 1,400 MMCFD goes to the power and fertiliser sectors, and 1,600 MMCFD is supplied through pipes to the distribution companies,"" he disclosed.
To this, the chief minister said that we would have to revisit our distribution policy so that the gas-producing province could get its maximum share. The state minister agreed with the CM to revisit the distribution policy for which a committee was constituted to frame their respective proposals and discuss them in the next meeting. 
Another issue the CM discussed with the visiting delegation, led by the state minister, was the Weighted Average Cost of Gas (WACOG) policy under which the imported LNG and local gas were pooled in the same energy box, and then a tariff is imposed. CM Shah said that the policy was unconstitutional and would further burden the consumers in Sindh and slowed the growth of economic activities. 
The chief minister said that WACOG was not viable as long as Sindh has surplus gas. ""Sindh preference to use gas in relation to other provinces is protected by Article 158 of the Constitution,"" he said and added that there should be zero load-shedding in the province as per the spirit of the Constitution.

7,Noor Jehan on fast recovery path,Global team of vets diagnosed and treated the tusker to bring her back to normal life,"A team of veterinarians and wildlife experts from global animal welfare organisation FOUR PAWS is on-site this week, to aid 17-year-old suffering elephant Noor Jehan at the Karachi Zoo.
Noor Jehan's suffering began with her limping. Her condition deteriorated fast to a worrying state that left her partially paralysed. During the examination, the experts identified an internal hematoma and a damaged pelvic floor as the main sources of her pain and physical distress. They provided immediate pain relief treatments and recommended proper care for Noor Jehan's rehabilitation.
Since 2021, FOUR PAWS has recommended relocating Noor Jehan and her companion Madhubala to a species-appropriate place that fulfils international standards. The authorities have now finally committed to relocating both elephants as soon as Noor Jehan is healthy enough to be moved.
""We welcome the commitment of the local zoo officials and authorities to finally relocate both elephants, after FOUR PAWS has recommended this action in favour of the elephants’ wellbeing already last year."" - Josef Pfabigan, Global CEO,@fourpawsint

Experts from the international animal welfare organisation were called for help by the zoo officials as the treatment and special equipment were not available in Pakistan.
The medical procedures to determine her condition and further treatment included an ultrasound examination and additional laboratory tests. To provide immediate relief to the suffering elephant, the team applied medications, administered vitamins and painkillers, and did hydrotherapy after identifying the cause of her serious condition.
""During the ultrasound examination, we detected an inner hematoma and a damaged pelvic floor. This shows that trauma must have happened, which has caused the current painful health condition, and also explains her unusual body position.
Noor Jehan needs a lot of movement to activate and train the muscles in her legs again, which will also improve the mobility of her digestive tract. She will also receive a special diet to recover soon.
""It is now more important than ever that Noor Jehan regains strength, so she and her companion Madhubala can soon be relocated to a more species-appropriate home, where she can recover fast. We gave recommendations and guidelines for Noor Jehan's recovery, her future and survival now depend on the zoo following them,"" says FOUR PAWS veterinarian Dr Amir Khalil, who is leading the expert team on-site.
Better life chances
""We welcome the commitment of the local zoo officials and authorities to finally relocate both elephants. We are glad that she still has a chance at a better life,"" said Josef Pfabigan, global CEO of FOUR PAWS.
He said the organisation would especially like to thank the Sindh governor for attending the medical assessment of Noor Jehan and for his overall support.
This once again shows the long-term, sustainable changes we can achieve when authorities and animal welfare experts work together closely. FOUR PAWS is ready to continue providing its support and expertise in Pakistan in cases where sustainable solutions can be achieved, to help improve the lives of as many animals as possible,"" Pfabigan added.

8,Court seeks report on missing PTI activist,Police say no one from PTI came to report Siddiqui's disappearance,"The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Thursday directed the police to submit a report on the petition for the recovery of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) social media activist Fahad Jamal Siddiqui and to register a case on the matter. A two-member bench headed by Justice Naimatullah Phulpoto heard the plea.
""Why hasn't Siddiqui's disappearance been officially reported?"" Justice Phulpoto questioned, at which the petitioner's attorney claimed that the police were not assisting them. However, the investigation officer said that no one from the PTI went to the precinct to report Siddiqui's disappearance.
Justice Phulpoto ordered the petitioner to visit the Aziz Bhatti police station today (Friday) to file the report of Siddiqui's disappearance and directed the police to submit a progress report on April 19.
Plea disposed
Separately, Justice Phulpoto disposed of the missing person plea pertaining to PTI social media activists Muhammad Arshad Siddiqui and Mudassar Rehman after they returned home.
The PTI counsel said Arshad and Rehman were dealing with post-traumatic stress and requested the court to order the relevant SHO to record the returned PTI workers' statements.
The judge ordered the workers to report to Aziz Bhatti police station and record their statements.
Meanwhile, the same bench heard the petition for the recovery of Sameer Khan Afridi and others, who have been missing for seven years, and sought a report on detention centres in the country.
