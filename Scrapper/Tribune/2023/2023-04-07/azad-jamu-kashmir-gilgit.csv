1,Pindi at risk from devastating floods,"Delay in cleaning of rain drains endangers lives of people living in
low-lying areas","The garrison city is at risk of experiencing devastating floods due to heavy monsoon rains this year and a lack of funds for the silt cleaning of 10 major rain drains, including Nullah Leh.
Prior to the monsoon season, the Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation (RMC) sought immediate funding of Rs40 million from the government for the cleaning of 10 significant rain drains across the garrison city.
Meanwhile, the Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) has also requested an additional Rs20 million from the government, claiming that the funds of Rs30 million provided earlier were inadequate given that the price of diesel has become double per litre in a year.
Sources claim that the WASA administration has adopted the stance that diesel, which was Rs150 per litre in April of last year, is now Rs300 per litre. “This amount is inadequate for the cleaning exercise because both small and large machinery shovels operate on diesel,” the WASA administration has argued.
It said with this amount only 50 per cent of the Nullah Leh could be cleaned, doubling the danger of flooding.
Due to the severe financial crisis, the government has not yet released the funds to the RMC for the proper cleaning of 10 large rain drains flowing across the city, while the first decade of April is about to end, the sources said. The cleaning must begin in May but the government is still going slow on the fund issue, they added.
“The pre-monsoon season is going to start after 1.5 months, and at least 2.5 months are required for cleaning the drains.”
WASA sources say that the price of diesel has increased significantly following which the private sector has also increased its rates.

3,CDA barred from acquiring land,Lahore High Court seeks replies from government functionaries on April 10,"The Lahore High Court Rawalpindi bench judge Justice Mirza Waqas Rauf on Thursday barred the Capital Development Authority (CDA) from acquiring 1,200-kanal of land on Chak Belli Road at Losar in the suburb of Rawalpindi for dumping capital’s waste.
The court issued the directives on petitions challenging the Rawalpindi administration’s notification, allowing the CDA to acquire the land and dump the capital’s waste at Losar.
Earlier, the CDA had to postpone the public hearing seeking objections regarding the dumping of the capital’s waste at Losar after the Punjab Environment Protection Department objected to the hurriedly called public debate.
Two weeks back, the Rawalpindi administration allocated 1,200-kanal of land to the CDA in Mauza Losar to dump the capital’s waste in violation of the court order. Rawalpindi Deputy Commissioner Hasan Waqar Cheema through a notification had given formal permission to the CDA to dump all garbage and harmful hospital waste from Islamabad at the Losar dumping site.
The high court accepted six petitions filed in this regard for hearing and issued notices to the CDA chairman, the Islamabad chief commissioner, the Rawalpindi commissioner and deputy commissioner and the Punjab government seeking their replies on April 10.
The court also summoned the head of the Rawalpindi Solid Waste Management Company at the next hearing. The petitions have been filed by three brick kiln owners and four citizens of the neighbourhood.
In the petitions, brick kiln owners Irfan and locals have taken the plea that there was already a waste dumping ground spread over 1,200-kanal at Losar to dump Rawalpindi’s waste. They said that the high court had ordered the removal of the existing dumping site.
The petitioners said that on the court order, the Rawalpindi Solid Waste Management Company decided to move the dumping site to Mandira Road and the process of acquiring 1,400-kanal was also started. 
They said that instead of removing the existing dumping site, the Rawalpindi administration has allowd the CDA to acquire 1,200-kanal to dump the capital’s waste.
The petitioners said that Islamabad is a separate district and it has plenty of unused land where it can dump the waste. 
They argued that garbage from another district cannot be allowed to be dumped in Rawalpindi.
They said that the existing dumping ground has already been declared illegal by the court, issuing an order to shift it to Mandira Road.
They said that the construction of dumping grounds on 2,400-kanal for both Rawalpindi and Islamabad will further increase infectious diseases including throat, ear, stomach and eye ailments in the entire area.
They said that the process of constructing a new dumping ground should be declared illegal and according to the court decision, the existing dumping ground of Rawalpindi should also be ordered to be shifted immediately.
The petitioners said that about 14 brick kilns will be affected if the dumping site was allowed to be constructed and the closure of these kilns will increase unemployment.
The LHC’s Rawalpindi bench had ordered to remove the dumping site, where waste from Rawalpindi is already being dumped, to Mandra–Chakwal Road, where the Rawalpindi administration had acquired 1,200-kanal of land.
Instead of moving the waste dumping site to Mandra–Chakwal Road, the admin has not only allowed the CDA to dispose of waste at Losar but also decided to dump the waste of the garrison city at the same location.
The PTI government had approved removing the dumping ground spreading on 1,250-kanal at Losar and moving it to Mandra–Chakwal Road. However, the current Rawalpindi administration decided against the order of the high court and allowed the CDA to dump the capital’s waste at the current dumping site.

5,Lawmakers fume over poor maintenance of lodges,MNA says rats roam in lodges and sanitary conditions are poor,"Members of the National Assembly (MNAs) on Thursday expressed their regret over the poor maintenance of Parliament Lodges by the Capital Development Authority (CDA) despite the allocation of funds.
During the question-hour session of the National Assembly, MNA Shagufta Jumani put a query on decaying partially constructed infrastructures of public departments devolved under the 18th Constitutional Amendment.
On a supplementary question, MNA, Sheikh Rohale Asghar of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) pointed out that the decaying buildings were under the notice of the authorities but the prevailing situation of the Parliament Lodges lay bare the performance of the civic agency.
MNA Rana Tanveer Hussain in his query said the media should ask what were the expenses and salaries of the parliamentarians while living in the lodges which were in a dilapidated condition. He said rats roam in the lodges and sanitary conditions are poor. “Parliamentarians won’t be able to perform their duty with this mental state.”

6,Dengue-breeding properties to be red-flagged,Govt asks citizens to obtain NOC before sale of marked plots,"Acting swiftly after the confirmation of 158 dengue positive hotspots in the garrison city, the district administration has decided to red-flag the vacant plots, which are littered with breeding grounds for the disease-carrying mosquitoes, besides making it mandatory to obtain a no-objection certificate from the deputy commissioner for sale of such plots.
In a meeting of the Divisional Emergency Response Committee chaired by Rawalpindi Commissioner Liaquat Ali Chattha, Chief Executive Officer Health Dr Ansar Ishaq told those in attendance that 291,739 hotspots were checked during the outdoor vector surveillance in the last month, out of which 158 found positive and the required action was taken.
“Similarly, 628,038 houses were checked during the indoor surveillance, out of which 1,137 houses came out positive and required action was taken,” he said.
The Rawalpindi commissioner said that two confirmed cases of dengue have been reported in the district so far, but we have to control it from the beginning.
He directed that all the departments should pay full attention to larva elimination as the current weather is extremely suitable for its breeding. “If it is not controlled now, it will be impossible to control the adult mosquito,” he said.
The commissioner strictly directed that there was no room for any kind of carelessness or misrepresentation in the measures taken to eliminate the dengue mosquitoes.
He directed that immediate arrangements should be made for the disposal of solid waste. “All vacant plots in the city have been identified and the owners of these plots have been served notices by the deputy commissioner,” he said and added that in case of non-compliance, such plots will be red-marked.
“Sale and purchase of red-marked plots will be subject to the NOC of the deputy commissioner.”
The commissioner further said that in view of the current rains, special attention should be given to the field activities and drainage arrangements should be made immediately.
“Apart from this, attention should be paid to the surveillance of the cemeteries and parks where there are weeds and there is a risk of water accumulation,” he said.
Chattha directed that teams appointed for dengue surveillance should try to control the growth of dengue larvae by checking graveyards and other places on a daily basis.

He emphasised that the curriculum should also focus on the behavioural change of the society towards differently-abled people (DAPs) to support and facilitate them as they have been facing several hardships in their daily lives, including negative attitudes and discrimination.
In order to financially empower the DAPs, the president urged the need for promptly filling their job quota by the federal and provincial governments, besides equipping them with employable skills.
