3,LHC puts off conviction of suspended lawyer,The matter had surfaced when Asif was found wearing a gown in the courtroom of Justice Shahzad,"A Lahore High Court’s division bench, headed by Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, on Thursday finally suspended a three month’s imprisonment order to release a member of the Punjab Bar Council, Rana Muhammad Asif, who was convicted in contempt proceedings.
Asif was arrested earlier in the wee hours of the day.
The relations between the bar and bench have soured for a long time after LHC’s Senior Puisne Judge Justice Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan not only awarded a three months imprisonment to Asif but also suspended his licence for allegedly disrespecting; pressuring the court through other lawyers; and halting its functions.
The matter had surfaced when Asif was found wearing a gown in the courtroom of Justice Shahzad.
As Justice Shahzad noticed it, he directed Asif to leave the courtroom for wearing the gown.
The judge further observed that the courtroom was not meant for changing or wearing the uniform of any advocate.
The lawyers then started shouting at the judge instead of paying any heed to the court’s directions.
Later, several rounds of negotiations were held between the bar and bench but all in vain.
As the lawyers started observing strikes across Punjab, the security at the LHC was beefed up.
Hundreds of police personnel were deployed at the LHC and the route leading to Justice Shahzad's courtroom was completely shut down by the law enforcers to avoid any untoward incident.

4,Verdict on Gill’s movement reserved,PTI leader’s vehicle stopped by police en route to airport,"The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Thursday reserved its decision on a plea filed by PTI leader Shahbaz Gill seeking direction to quarters concerned for not barring his travel to the United States and restricting them from creating any hindrance in his journey to the airport.
Gill filed the petition through Barrister Ahmad Pansota, demanding provision of the details of first information reports (FIRs) registered against him and protective bails in any FIR either lodged, concealed or disclosed before the LHC during the proceedings so that the petitioner may approach the court for pre-arrest bail.
As proceedings commenced, the petitioner’s counsel argued that on April 10, 2022, immediately after the vote of no confidence against former premier Imran Khan, Gill and others were placed on the Provisional National Identification List (PNIL).
He continued that when they challenged it before Islamabad High Court (IHC), the petitioner’s name was removed from PNIL, and the writ petition was disposed of. He contended that after the vote of no confidence the incumbent government started to register criminal cases against the leadership of the PTI, including Gill, to arrest them and to place their names on the Exit Control List (ECL).
Pansota continued that Gill was also victimised and roped in several criminal cases registered across Pakistan. “The petitioner, against the actions of the respondents and the government, knocked on the doors of the courts whereupon several criminal cases were quashed and, in some cases, either Gill was declared innocent or granted the concession of bail”.
The lawyer stated that Gill later discovered that his name was on the ECL as of October 17, 2022, with the approval of the cabinet.
“This unlawful act and omission of placing the name of the petitioner on the ECL were assailed by the petitioner before LHC wherein a larger bench was constituted,” he said.
