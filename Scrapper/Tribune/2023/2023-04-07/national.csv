0,Wall Street heads lower ahead of jobs report,Bond yields steady as investors digest weak labour data,"US stocks headed lower and Treasury yields halted their plunge on Thursday, as investors digested weak labour market data and looked to Friday’s jobs report for signs the Federal Reserve’s restrictive policy could be edging the economy closer to recession.
All three major US stock indexes were red, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq on course to snap three-week winning streaks at the conclusion of the holiday-shortened week. On Friday, a market holiday, the Labour Department is due to release its March employment report, and market participants will have the weekend to digest the data before Monday’s opening bell.
“We have had a few days in a row of weak economic data,” said Tom Hanlin, national investment strategist at US Bank Wealth Management. “The question is, are we seeing a slowing economy? Will the Fed continue to raise interest rates, and will this result in a recession this year?”

1,‘Pakistan always supported use of RMB’,"Minister of planning says CPEC must for Pakistan’s economic growth, regional connectivity","Pakistan and China have pledged to deepen their economic ties, with Pakistan signalling its support for China’s efforts to expand the use of the Renminbi (RMB) as a global currency. Minister of Planning, Development and Special Initiatives, Ahsan Iqbal, said during his visit to Beijing that China had been ramping up support for RMB clearing and settlement in its foreign trade, especially with Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) countries
He added that Pakistan was one of the leading countries using RMB for international trade settlement, with the ML-1 project, worth almost $8 to $9 billion, being structured with deals in RMB. He said Pakistan had already signed a memorandum of understanding with China to facilitate the use of RMB in bilateral trade and investment.
The minister also praised the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a flagship project of the BRI, which he said had not only been central to Pakistan’s economic growth but had also contributed to regional connectivity and development.
During his meeting with Li Chunlin, Vice Chairman of China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), Iqbal reaffirmed Pakistan’s strong commitment to the smooth and high-quality development of the next phase of CPEC with a greater focus on the development of industrial parks and Special Economic Zones (SEZs).

2,Reserves fall by $36m to $4.2b,Reserves projected to rise to around $7-8 billion by the end of the current fiscal year,"The foreign exchange reserves held by the central bank fell by 0.85% on a week-on-week basis to $4.2 billion, according to data released by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Thursday.
On March 31, 2023, the SBP’s foreign currency reserves stood at $4,207.9 million, down by $36 million compared to $4,244.3 million on March 24. The central bank attributed the decrease in foreign exchange reserves to debt repayments.
Overall, the liquid foreign currency reserves held by the country, including the net reserves held by banks other than the SBP, stood at $9,759.8 million. The net reserves held by banks amounted to $5,551.9 million.
Ismail Iqbal Securities Head of Research Fahad Rauf recently said that any significant improvement in Pakistan’s foreign currency reserves depended on the revival of International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) loan programme and the inflow of fresh financing from other multilateral and bilateral creditors.
“They (FX reserves) are projected to rise to around $7-8 billion by the end of the current fiscal year on June 30, 2023,” he said.

3,PIA seeks Rs45b bailout package,"Also sought extension of 5-year government facility, ending on June 30, to pay interest costs","Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has sought another Rs45 billion bailout package from the government to pay for interest costs and finance its operations – a demand that provides more reasons to sell the entity.
The Ministry of Aviation has also sought continuation of the five-year government facility to pick the interest cost, ending on June 30, until the airline’s balance sheet is restructured, according to sources in the ministries of finance and aviation.
The demands were placed before Finance Minister Ishaq Dar on Thursday who did not immediately commit to any additional financial support, said the sources. Dar instead asked the management to make a viable business plan, sources added.
The PIA has asked for a Rs22 billion federal injection to pay off interest on its loans, Rs15.6 billion in the shape of additional sovereign guarantees to take more loans, and another Rs7 billion to buy an aircraft, according to the sources.
A finance ministry handout stated that Dar chaired a meeting on matters of Railways and Aviation that was also attended by the Federal Minister for Railways and Aviation Khawaja Saad Rafique.
“The meeting also discussed the restructuring of PIACL in order to enhance its performance and make it compatible with international standards,” according to the ministry. The finance minister promised to support the timely execution of the Civil Aviation, PIA, and Pakistan Railways projects, it added.
The 2013-18 Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government had made the mistake of amending the PIA law to stop the sale of majority shares that would transfer management control – a political decision that has so far cost taxpayers Rs100 billion alone between 2018-23. PIA’s losses have multiplied during this period and had reached Rs633 billion in September 2022.
In April 2021, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf (PTI) government also approved splitting PIA into two companies; good PIA with only Rs137 billion in liabilities along with core assets, and bad PIA which has liabilities worth Rs457 billion and will retain the ownership of its non-core assets. But this plan was never implemented.
Since 2017, at least three PIA restructuring exercises have been carried out – but in absence of a viable business plan – and yet the national flag carrier has been incurring heavy losses.
The sources said that in December 2017 the then government had picked PIA’s interest cost for five years on the condition that the airline would become financially viable. The PIA management, however, on Thursday requested the finance minister to extend the interest-payment facility until the financial restructuring is complete – a goal that may never be achieved given it poor performance in the past.
For the current fiscal year, the government allocated Rs15 billion in the budget for interest payments. PIA, however, has demanded Rs22 billion more. It claimed, in the meeting, that the finance ministry had allocated Rs15 billion in the budget against the annual requirement of nearly Rs32 billion. The airline added that due to an increase in interest rates, the total debt servicing cost for this fiscal year would jump to Rs37 billion.
PIA is also short on its payments to the Pakistan State Oil company, K-Electric, and the Federal Board of Revenue, fleet insurance, aircraft and engine lessors.
The airline has also demanded an increase in the limit of the sovereign guarantee by Rs15.6 billion to over Rs263 billion aimed at taking more loans to remain afloat. PIA’s current guarantees limit was Rs248 billion, which has already been exhausted. In case, PIA fails to service its debt, the banks have the option of cashing these sovereign guarantees.
PIA also sought tax and duties exemptions on the import of aircraft parts and related equipment.
The airline has been managed by people who do not have relevant experience, causing huge bleeding at a time when the government is already facing the very real danger of defaulting on its foreign payments. Sources said that there was strong resistance to the suggestion of privatising PIA.

4,NCCPL to collect 13% SST from PSX stockbrokers,ICB expresses interest in buying Silkbank shares worth €50 million,"The National Clearing Company of Pakistan (NCCPL) has announced on Thursday that it will collect Sindh sales tax (SST) at 13% on services to stockbrokers at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) after the provincial government recently amended the relevant laws. NCCPL will collect SST on its invoices with effect from March 14, 2023.
Clearing members, who settle trade deals among brokers and investors at NCCPL, are advised to pay the tariff for the month of March 2023 along with SST at 13% on the fifth settlement day, which is April 7, 2023.
The collection of SST is not new to the stockbrokers, as many of them were already paying it to the Sindh Revenue Board (SRB). The recent amendment in SST on Services Act 2011 has authorised the NCCPL to collect the tax on behalf of SRB and submit the same with it.
Speaking to the Express Tribune, NCCPL Chief Executive Officer Muhammad Lukman said, “The collection of tax will add no new cost to clearing members in our opinion.”
“NCCPL offers five to six services to PSX members, including clearing and settlement of stock trade deals, financing to investors through brokers to buy stocks, and collection of capital gains tax. Clearing members will now pay 13% SST on the NCCPL services valued at Rs50 million a month, estimated to be roughly Rs5-6 million a month,” said Lukman.
In other news, Silkbank has received foreign interest. International Commercial Bank (ICB) of South Sudan has expressed an interest in subscribing to the shares of Silkbank Limited up to the extent of €50 million, subject to all regulatory requirements and financial due diligence. The board of directors of the bank has reviewed and “considered the letter of intention and accordingly granted its approval to the management of the bank to formally pursue the potential investment.”

5,Fertiliser players look to source gas from alternate networks,"Hike in gas tariffs on SSGC, SNGPL networks causing disparity in urea prices","Gas tariff obscurity has caused significant disparities in urea prices across Pakistan. The recent hike in gas tariffs has caused major fertiliser players to source gas from different networks, leading to an increase in the cost of production and ultimately causing a disparity in urea prices across the country.
The government of Pakistan recently raised gas tariffs for the Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) and Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) network, in line with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) demand for electricity and gas tariff rationalisation, according to an Insight Securities research report. However, major fertiliser players source gas from the Mari network, for which an explicit notification of a price hike has not yet been issued.
Insight Securities, fertiliser sector analyst, Muhammad Kazim said, “Even Fauji Fertiliser Bin Qasim Limited (FFBL) and Engro Fertiliser (EFERT)’s Enven plants were hit by the cost escalation due to the hike in gas prices by 69% and 47% for feed and fuel, respectively, on the SNGPL and SSGCL networks.”
“The impact has been passed on to urea prices, and the increase is mainly attributable to the price hike for Enven and cost escalation on PP-12 billed gas due to rupee devaluation. In addition, rampant inflation in the country has also resulted in higher costs of production,” said Kazim.
Speaking to the Express Tribune, fertiliser sector analyst, Waqas Ghani Kukaswadia said, “Since mid-February 2023, there has been a lack of clarity among fertiliser manufacturers. As gas prices were not explicitly notified for Mari Petroleum Company Limited (MPCL) network fertiliser companies, the price increase for urea was put on hold by manufacturers on the Mari network.”
This leads to different prices for urea to prevail in the market, causing disorderly price increments. Due to the delays in clarification, middlemen were incentivised to pocket additional profit as urea prices have remained around Rs3,000 per bag in the market for farmers since February.
Despite these economic challenges, the demand for urea remains stable due to its price inelasticity as the nutrient offtake is necessary to ensure food security in the country.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, another fertiliser sector analyst Abdullah Umer Khan Lodhi said, “The fertiliser industry has strong pricing power, which enables it to easily transfer any cost increase to farmers.”
“In the current market scenario, there are three different quotes available for the bag of urea. However, it has been observed that urea is being sold at higher than retail prices by dealers i.e., Rs3,000-3,200 per bag. We anticipate that the industry will soon revert to the standard pricing model of identical urea prices,” said Kazim.

6,Rupee recovers nearly Rs3.5 over Saudi assurance,"Hits one-week high, closes at Rs284.42 against greenback","Pakistani currency got the much-awaited support and hit a one-week high beyond Rs285 to a dollar on Thursday after confirmation from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that Saudi Arabia had given a financial commitment of $2 billion to Islamabad.
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reported that the rupee regained 1.21%, or Rs3.43, and closed at Rs284.42 against the greenback in the inter-bank market. The currency had hit an all-time low for the second consecutive day on Wednesday at Rs287.85/$.
Talking to The Express Tribune, Arif Habib Limited Head of Research Tahir Abbas said that the green light from Saudi Arabia, which indicated that it stood with Pakistan in the current testing times, provided vital support to the rupee.
Financial commitment from friendly countries is the last IMF condition for the resumption of its $6.5 billion loan programme.
“Saudi Arabia’s financial commitment suggests Pakistan is getting closer to the resumption of loan programme,” Abbas said.
He pointed out that the UAE’s nod for a similar financial commitment was still awaited, which was required to boost Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves, a must to stabilise and strengthen the rupee against foreign currencies.
Pakistan has to bridge the external financing gap of $6 billion by acquiring loans from friendly countries by June 30, 2023. “The IMF wants to see half of the expected inflows reflect in the foreign exchange reserves by the time the loan programme is resumed,” he said.
“Loan programme should restart now. Government should focus on the economy. Delay in revival of the programme has already caused heavy losses such as the closure of industrial units and loss of a large number of jobs.”
Suspension of the programme for about four times since July 2019 has led to a historic high inflation, massive rupee depreciation and soaring interest rate in the country.
He expressed hope that the rupee would stabilise around Rs275 to the dollar by the end of June 2023 after a staff-level agreement with the IMF.
Earlier, the rupee lost 1.5%, or Rs4.19, in the past four successive working days to an all-time low at Rs287.85/$ on Wednesday.
Abbas emphasised that all political parties must lend their support to the IMF programme. “Whoever comes to power after general elections this year will have to opt for a new and bigger IMF programme to fix the faltering economy in the long run.”
Revival of the current programme will result in release of a loan tranche of $1.1 billion.
Besides, other global creditors will unlock financing of billions of dollars as they have committed around $9 billion in flood relief at the Geneva conference in January 2023.
The receipts will improve Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves, reduce the risk of debt default and prop up the rupee.
State Bank Governor Jameel Ahmad said on Tuesday that the reserves would cross $10 billion in three months, once the government reached an agreement with the IMF. At present, the reserves stand at $4.24 billion.

7,ECNEC approves Diamer Basha project at Rs1.2 trillion,Cost saw an increase of Rs302 billion against original price due to rupee devaluation,"The government on Thursday approved the Diamer Basha power generation project at a cost of over Rs1.2 trillion, showing an increase of Rs302 billion against the original price mainly due to rupee devaluation.
The Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC), which approved the 4,500MW power generation project, considered a total of 10 summaries. Majority of those came before the forum due to years of mismanagement, which required further cost escalation.
Headed by Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, the ECNEC approved eight projects worth Rs1.4 trillion – a cost that was nearly Rs376 billion or 27% higher than the original estimates of these schemes.
The ECNEC approved the project at Rs1.24 trillion against the original estimates of Rs933.6 billion, with a noticeable increase of one-third or Rs302 billion of the project cost within a few years. The ECNEC had also discussed the initial cost last year.
Earlier, the Water Resources Ministry submitted PC-I for power generation facilities at a total cost of Rs933.6 billion, including a foreign loan of Rs409 billion. The foreign loan component has now been increased to Rs598 billion. But the cost of the project was updated on the average floating exchange rate of January 2023, Rs234.13 to a dollar. WAPDA will be implementing the project by making the timely arrangement of financing for the power generation part of the project.
The main objective of the project is to generate 4,500MWs hydropower as part of the Diamer Basha Dam project. The dam component of the project is already under implementation.
The Cabinet Committee on Energy had split the construction into two phases; the dam and power generation facilities. The ECNEC approved the dam in 2018. The National Transmission & Despatch Company (NTDC) will ensure that construction of the power evacuation infrastructure is synchronised with the commissioning date of the project and will explore financing from foreign lenders, prior to submission of PC-I for power evacuation arrangement.
The projects are being approved at a time when there is scarcity of resources and the government is drastically reducing development spending, except on schemes recommended by parliamentarians.
The ECNEC deferred the proposal of delegating executive powers to electricity distribution companies for the approval of schemes in the electoral constituencies after the bureaucracy did not back the move.
The steering committee of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Achievement Programme – an acronym used to fund schemes recommended by members of parliament – had proposed that in order to expedite the approval of electrification schemes, the Power Division may delegate its authority to approve such schemes to the board of directors of the distribution companies.
However, the existing rules do not allow for such delegation, especially for projects funded via the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP). The government had already tried and failed at getting approval from the Central Development Working Party (CDWP) and the ECNEC, causing a huge wastage of funds.
In the meeting, a question was raised about a mechanism to stop the duplication of such electricity projects. Due to lack of consensus on a proposal to authorise the power secretary to ensure that there is no duplication, the matter was deferred.
A finance ministry handout stated that the ECNEC, after discussion, allowed for the continuity of the prevailing mechanisms and allowed the Power Division to approve SDG schemes.
The ECNEC also approved a summary submitted by the Planning Commission on procedures to clear pending liabilities of closed projects. The PSDP projects are launched with the approval of competent fora and are supposed to be closed after clearing of all project liabilities – however, in certain cases, projects are closed without clearing liabilities. In such cases, sponsoring agencies regularly approach the Planning Commission for allocation of resources to clear the pending liabilities.
It was decided that the liabilities should be audited by the external auditor i.e., auditor general office or through internal auditors. For payment of pending liabilities, relevant projects may be revised with the approval of departmental working parties and the requisite funds may be allocated via technical supplementary grants to clear audited pending liabilities.
Sialkot Motorway
The meeting also deferred the approval of a link road to connect Narowal with Lahore – the Sialkot Motorway. The CDWP approved the project in principle and recommended it to the ECNEC at the cost of Rs36.8 billion on equal cost sharing basis between the centre and Punjab. However, the Punjab government did not support the project on Thursday. The original cost of the link road project was Rs14.2 billion, which has already been increased by 160%.
The ECC approved the Gomal Zam project at the revised cost of Rs26.6 billion – 103% higher than its initial cost. Initially, the project had been approved in the year 2001 at a cost of Rs12.8 billion.
In addition, the ECNEC approved the Digital Economy Enhancement Project (DEEP) at the revised cost of Rs17.5 billion funded by the World Bank, “Land Acquisition, Affected Properties, and Compensation for Rajanpur – Dera Ghazi Khan Section as four-lane highway and Dualisation and Rehabilitation of Dera Ghazi Khan – Dera Ismail Khan Section of N- 55” project at a rationalised cost of Rs11.4 billion and reconstruction of the Turbat-Mand Road from Motorway (M-8) to Iranian Border (Radeeq) project at a cost of Rs19.6 billion, 87% higher than the cost approved initially.
Besides, the economic body also okayed the construction of the Panjgur-Gichak-Awaran road at a cost 88% higher than the original price and the Shagharthand project at 441% higher costs.

8,Ministry to approve E&P field plan,Govt delegates powers to petroleum ministry to accelerate exploration activities,"The federal government has delegated powers to the Petroleum Division for the approval of development plan for exploration licences aimed at expediting the approval process and ensuring long-term energy security by boosting oil and gas production activities.
Earlier, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet was approving the Declaration of Commerciality (DoC) and Field Development Plan (FDP) for the holders of exploration licences.
Now, the ECC has allowed the Petroleum Division to approve the DoC and FDP to expedite processing.
Sources told The Express Tribune that the Petroleum Division sought amendments to rules, which the Cabinet Committee on Energy approved.
During an ECC meeting held on March 30, it was requested that in order to expedite the approval process with the objective of enhancing oil and gas production, the Petroleum Division may also be authorised to approve the request of DoC/FDP for exploration licences granted under the Pakistan Petroleum (Exploration and Production) Rules 1986.
The division shared concerns that Pakistan was facing challenges in meeting the ever-growing energy needs due to its expanding population, natural depletion of major oil and gas fields, rise in demand, dearth of new big discoveries and economic growth.
It was added that increasing the exploration and development activities was essential to overcome the challenges. The petroleum ministry stated that expeditious exploration and production (E&P) activities were critical for the growth of Pakistan’s oil and gas industry and long-term energy security.
Accelerated exploration and augmented development work were extremely essential in order to reverse the decline in crude oil and gas production, increase hydrocarbon output and reduce reliance on imported energy, which left an adverse impact on balance of payments and trade, it added. ECC was informed that the Petroleum Division was taking various measures and one such step pertained to the approval of DoC and FDP on a fast-track basis where various exploration and development activities were underway.
The approval is granted to ensure the smooth running of development operations and enable the petroleum rights holders to make efforts for exploring the hydrocarbon deposits.
Petroleum Division pointed out that it had received an application from Mari Petroleum Company Limited (MPCL) for approval of the DoC and FDP for Hilal and Iqbal discoveries in accordance with Rule 24, read with Rule 33(1) of Pakistan Petroleum (Exploration and Production) Rules 1986.
Based on the volumetric estimates, initial performance, forecast and economic evaluation, both Hilal and Iqbal discoveries had been declared as commercial. According to MPCL’s estimates, the two discoveries have reserves of 21.03 billion cubic feet (bcf) of gas.
Petroleum Division told the ECC that the case had been reviewed thoroughly taking into consideration the estimated reserves and economic evaluation of the fields.
It requested the committee to approve the DoC and FDP for Iqbal-1 with effect from May 9, 2022 and Hilal-1 effective from April 15, 2022.
ECC considered a summary submitted by the Petroleum Division titled “Declaration of Commerciality, Approval of Field Development Plan over Hilal and Iqbal Discoveries” and gave its approval.
In its meeting, the cabinet committee also reviewed the request for extended well testing at Ghazij-1 discovery.
Petroleum Division informed the ECC that a development and production lease was granted for Mari discovery to MPCL (then Mari Gas) under the Pakistan Petroleum (Exploration and Production) Rules 1986.
Currently, Mari field is producing 752 million standard cubic feet of gas per day (mmscfd) and 101 barrels of condensate per day. The lease will remain valid till November 10, 2024. The company has so far acquired 1,077 square km of 3D seismic data. Based on results of the data, MPCL has made a new gas discovery in Mari lease by drilling a well namely Ghazij-1.
Petroleum Division received a request from MPCL for extended well testing to appraise the discovery in Ghazij-1 exploration well drilled under the Mari development and production lease.
Extended well testing is a technical requirement and common industrial practice to assess the oil and gas discovery to establish the extent of reserves and evaluate the reservoir’s performance for the declaration of commerciality. “The request of the company for extended well testing is rational and in line with the applicable petroleum policy and rules,” the Petroleum Division said.
It proposed a one-year extended well testing with effect from the start of production (expected date of production was the fourth week of February 2023), subject to the condition that MPCL would submit the DoC and FDP before expiry of the extended well testing period.
The production taken under the test production arrangement would be accounted for in the payment of production bonus. The company shall fulfill all other statutory obligations like rentals, training and social welfare as per applicable rules. ECC considered a summary submitted by the Petroleum Division titled “Request for Extended Well Testing over Ghazij-1 Discovery” and granted its approval.
