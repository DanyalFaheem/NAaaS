0,Not respecting SC verdict have consequences: Imran,PTI chief wonders what message govt is sending to investors,"PTI chairman Imran Khan has warned that foreign investors may be getting a troubling message after the government's decision to not accept the Supreme Court's decision in the Punjab poll delay case.
He took to Twitter to express his concerns over the situation, warning that investors may lack confidence in a country's judicial system if the government disregards court orders. He said, ""Investors need security of contracts & that means faith in judicial system. What confidence can they have when govt itself casting aside SC orders? This happens in a banana republic.""
The PTI chief also claimed that the sedition cases filed against him and the imprisonment of senior party leader Ali Amin Gandapur are attempts to undermine their party's ability to contest elections.
He alleged that this was part of a ""London Plan"" in which Nawaz Sharif was given assurances that the PTI would be crushed before elections through fake cases and imprisonment of its leadership.
Sedition cases against me - this is 144th case against me- and our senior ldr Ali Amin along with his imprisonment, are simply attempts to undermine our Party's ability to fight elections. This is all part of London Plan in which Nawaz Sharif was given assurances that PTI would
The PTI chairman has been pushing for assembly elections in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa provinces as part of a campaign to force an early general election that he has waged since being forced from office a year ago after losing a vote of confidence.

However, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has rejected Imran Khan's call for an early general election and his government had backed the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) delay in the votes in the two provinces to Oct 8.
The commission cited a lack of resources and the government agreed, saying it was not possible to organise the provincial elections while the country was struggling with an economic crisis and with a general election due around early October anyway.
But the Supreme Court ruled that the delay was illegal and voting in the two provinces should be held between April 30 and May 15.
A three-member SC bench comprising Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial, Justice Ijazul Ahsan, and Justice Munib Akhtar had announced the verdict on the PTI's petition challenging the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) move to postpone the Punjab Assembly polls till October 8.
The government's refusal to accept the Supreme Court's decision has raised concerns about the state of country's democracy and judicial system. It remains to be seen how this situation will be resolved and what impact it will have on the country's economy and its relations with foreign investors.

1,Moon-sighting researcher predicts likely Eid date,Ruet-e-Hilal Research Council expects the festive day to fall on Saturday,"The Ruet-i-Hilal Research Council (RHRC) on Friday said that Eidul Fitr is likely to be celebrated across the nation this year on Saturday, April 22, Express News reported.
The council's Secretary-General, Khalid Ijaz Mufti, said that the committee's meeting is set to convene on Thursday, April 20, in order to sight the Shawwal moon.
If the crescent is sighted on Thursday evening, then Eid-ul-Fitr will be celebrated on Friday, April 21. However, he added, it was unlikely that the moon will be sighted the same evening.
He said that Eid will most likely be celebrated on April 22 after completing 30 fasting days of the holy month of Ramazan.
According to the council, the birth of the moon is expected to occur on Thursday, April 20, at 9:13am Pakistan time. On the evening of the 29th of Ramazan, the moon's age at sunset should be more than 19 hours for sighting. However, in all areas of Pakistan, it will be less than 10 hours, it added.
It said that the difference between sunset and moonset, which should be more than 40 minutes, will only be 21 minutes in Peshawar, Gilgit, Muzaffarabad, Charsadda, Islamabad/Rawalpindi, Quetta, and Jiwani, and 20 minutes in Lahore and Karachi.

It said that even if weather conditions throughout Pakistan are clear, there is no possibility of sighting the moon, even with a telescope, on the evening of April 20.
Mufti said that the 30th of Ramazan will be observed on April 21, and the 1st of Shawwal will be celebrated on April 22. He also affirmed that any reports of crescent sighting from any province, city, or area of Pakistan on the evening of April 20 would be false.
He stated that on the evening of April 21, the moon's age at sunset will be more than 33 hours in all areas of Pakistan. Additionally, the difference between sunset and moonset will be 80 minutes, which is considerable.
As a result, he pointed out, the crescent will appear thick and late on the night of the 30th fast, leading some people to believe it is not the first but a two-day-old crescent. However, from both a Sharia and scientific perspective, it will be considered the first crescent.
Eidul Fitr marks the end of the holy month of Ramazan, during which Muslims fast from dawn until dusk. The festival is typically celebrated with prayers, family gatherings, and feasting.
The exact date of Eidul Fitr is determined by the sighting of the crescent moon, which marks the beginning of the Islamic month of Shawwal.

2,Two killed in accidental G-B dam blast,Explosion took place at Diamer-Bhasha dam construction site,"At least two people were killed and seven others seriously injured in an accidental explosion at the Diamer-Bhasha dam construction site in Gilgit-Baltistan (G-B) on Friday.
According to the official Twitter handle of Infodor, a media and news company, a blast occurred at the Diamer-Bhasha dam in Pakistan during mountain exploration using explosives in which two people were killed and seven injured.
“The affectees (injured and bodies) were taken to a nearby hospital. Safety measures at the site are being investigated.”
According to reports, the explosive material, which is used in construction activities, blew up while work was ongoing.
A day earlier, the government approved the Diamer-Basha power generation project at a cost of over Rs1.2 trillion, showing an increase of Rs302 billion against the original price mainly due to the devaluation of the rupee.
The main objective of the project was to generate 4,500MW of hydropower as part of the Diamer-Bhasha dam project.
The Cabinet Committee on Energy had split the construction into two phases; the dam and power generation facilities.
Earlier this week, a fire ripped through the camp of a Chinese company managing the construction of a remote hydropower dam in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.
The police said that the pre-dawn blaze ruined a warehouse complex of the Dasu hydropower project in Kohistan district.
""It was a huge fire,"" a Rescue 1122 official at the site said. ""Initially, the flames were very high and we had to call for fire brigade vehicles from two other districts.""
He said, ""It was quite a big storehouse, and apart from oil drums, stationery and machinery were also stockpiled there. That's all been destroyed in the fire.""
The camp housed Chinese engineers, surveyors, and mechanics, but both the police and Rescue 1122 said none were injured or killed.
One police official said an electrical fault was the suspected cause of the fire.

3,Lawyer moves SJC to get top judge sacked,Complaint calls on SJC to remove CJP Bandial in accordance with Article 209(6) as he is ‘guilty of misconduct’,"A complaint has been lodged with the Supreme Judicial Council calling for the removal of Chief Justice of Pakistan, Justice Umar Ata Bandial.
The complaint, filed by lawyer Raja Sibtain Khan, alleges that the chief justice engaged in misconduct by dividing judges into groups and securing their support to influence the outcome of a case.
The complaint relates to a case about the delay of provincial elections in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) and argues that the chief justice constituted a bench based on these groupings to obtain a majority decision in favor of his own interests.
The complaint claims that the actions of the chief justice violated the Constitution and the fundamental rights of the people of Pakistan, and demonstrated unfaithfulness and disloyalty to the State. The complainant has called for an investigation into the matter and for the chief justice to be removed from his position.
This complaint comes amid an ongoing dispute between the coalition PDM government and the judiciary over the holding of elections in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa provinces.
