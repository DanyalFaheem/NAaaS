0,Rupee drops as dollar demand rises,"Ends two-day winning streak, loses 0.13% at Rs238.50","Pakistani rupee slightly dropped by 0.13%, or Rs0.38, at Rs238.50 against the US dollar on Monday, ending two consecutive days of winning streak in the inter-bank market.
Market talk suggested that there was a slight increase in demand for the dollar, when trading resumed after a long weekend spanning four days.
It was contrary to expectations of a continuous uptrend in the rupee’s value in the wake of removal of the condition of depositing up to 100% advance payment for imports.
Pakistan has reopened imports for a full range of goods to meet another condition of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to pave the way for the resumption of $6.5 billion loan programme.
Experts were, however, of the view that the lifting of cash margin condition would make no difference since Pakistan had critically low foreign currency reserves of $4.6 billion. With these limited reserves, the country may only finance imports for about a month.
Moreover, they did not see the revival of IMF’s programme anytime soon, considering that Pakistan had to take financial commitments of $6-7 billion from friendly countries, which have so far given a cold response owing to a heightened political crisis in the country.
Earlier, the rupee recovered 0.28%, or Rs0.81, over two days and reached Rs283.20 against the greenback, according to SBP data. The domestic currency hit an all-time low close at Rs285.09/$ in the first week of February 2023, after the global lending institutions expressed concern about continued government control over the rupee-dollar parity.
The government has taken a number of tough decisions to revive the IMF’s programme, including reinstating the market-based exchange rate, increase in energy tariffs and presenting a mini-budget of Rs170 billion.
However, the fund comes up with a new condition every time Pakistan approaches it.

1,Oil rises on Kurdistan output halt,After arbitration case confirmed Baghdad’s consent was needed to ship oil from Turkey,"Oil prices rose on Monday after a halt to oil exports from Iraqi Kurdistan via Turkey and moves to contain a potential banking crisis that could have hit demand for crude.
Brent crude futures were up $1.16, or 1.6%, at $76.15 a barrel by 1210 GMT. West Texas Intermediate US crude rose $1.19, or 1.7%, to $70.45.
Brent gained 2.8% last week while WTI rebounded by 3.8% as jitters in the banking sector eased.
About half a percent of global oil supply, or 450,000bpd, of crude exports from Kurdistan stopped on Saturday after a victory in an arbitration case confirmed Baghdad’s consent was needed to ship the oil from Turkey.
First Citizens BancShares Inc said it will acquire the deposits and loans of failed Silicon Valley Bank, closing one chapter in the crisis of confidence that has ripped through financial markets.
Oil prices also drew support from Putin’s plans to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus.

2,Saudi Aramco invests in two Chinese refineries,"The two companies will be supplied with 690,000 bpd of crude oil","Saudi Aramco raised its multi-billion-dollar investment in China by finalising and upgrading a planned joint venture in northeast China and acquiring an expanded stake in a privately controlled petrochemical group.
The two deals, announced separately on Sunday and Monday, will see Aramco supplying the two Chinese companies with a combined 690,000 barrels a day of crude oil, bolstering its rank as China’s top provider of the commodity. Aramco said on Monday it had agreed to acquire a 10% stake in privately controlled Rongsheng Petrochemical Co Ltd for about $3.6 billion.
The deal includes the supply of 480,000 bpd of crude oil to Rongsheng-controlled Zhejiang Petrochemical Corp (ZPC) for 20 years, Aramco added. It follows a preliminary agreement Aramco reached with the Zhejiang provincial government in 2018 for a 9% stake in ZPC.
The deals are the biggest to be announced since Chinese President Xi Jinping visited the kingdom in December where he called for oil trade in yuan, a move that would weaken the U.S. dollar’s dominance in global trade.
Aramco’s investments highlight Riyadh’s deepening ties with Beijing which have raised security concerns in Washington, Riyadh’s traditional ally. In a deal brokered by China, Iran and Saudi Arabia agreed to re-establish relations earlier this month after years of hostility that had fueled conflicts across the region.
Beijing’s secret role in the breakthrough shook up dynamics in the Middle East, where the United States was for decades the main dealmaker. The Rongsheng deal comes on the heels of Aramco’s agreement with Chinese partners on Sunday for an oil refinery and petrochemical project in the northeast Chinese province of Liaoning.
The Liaoning project, expected to start in 2026, will be Aramco’s second major refining-petrochemical investment in China and follows the world’s top oil exporter reporting a record profit of $161 billion in 2022.

3,"Focus on quality, not price: Finnish envoy","Says Pakistani companies need to improve branding, packaging, and marketing","Pakistan needs to focus on offering quality products instead of competing on price to improve its exports, according to Finland Pakistan Business Council (FPBC) Chairman, and Honorary Consul General of Pakistan to Finland, Wille Eerola.
Speaking exclusively to The Express Tribune, Eerola said, “Pakistani companies, including those in the IT sector, often offer cheap prices, but buyers in Finland prioritise quality over price.” He said Pakistani companies need to improve their branding, packaging, and marketing to attract customers from afar.
“People look at the packaging and make purchasing decisions. People do not know about Pakistan in our country, so when they see a product, they cannot relate to it to make a buying decision,” said Eerola. He urged the Pakistani government to work on improving the image of the country and its individuals.
“If a former prime minister gives an interview to an international media outlet and says that the country is in turmoil and the system is near collapse, then foreign investors, businessmen and purchaser are not going to believe otherwise. Companies will be reluctant to give orders because they won’t know if they will be fulfilled or not,” he said.
Eerola also stressed the need for Pakistan to find its niche by promoting unique products, instead of being known for the cheapest. He criticised Pakistan for failing to promote itself, particularly in destinations like Europe.
Despite these challenges, Eerola said that international companies are still interested in Pakistan, and the country will overcome its economic challenges.
Meanwhile, Ezzat Natsheh, an official of Finnish company KONE, urged Pakistan to change its “seth” mindset, which discourages entrepreneurial skill development by allowing business decisions to be transferred to family members. Natsheh said the lack of clarity, stability, and the number of surprises in Pakistan make it difficult for businesses to invest in the country.
“To create jobs, the government needs to support entrepreneurs in Pakistan as they help create jobs. Education, which is teacher-centric in Pakistan, is old-fashioned and the teacher is expected to know everything. We have a system where students participate, and that way, they evolve a lot faster and greater,” said Eerola.
FPBC recently organised business summits in Islamabad and Karachi to strengthen bilateral trade and business between Pakistan and Finland, involving over 20 Finnish companies. Despite Pakistan’s efforts to reduce imports, the country’s trade deficit reached $21.3 billion in the first eight months of the current fiscal year, and exports have not achieved any significant improvement. The government has curbed imports and is attempting to improve exports.
According to Eerola, Pakistan must focus on improving its quality and branding to compete in international markets. By promoting unique products and improving packaging and marketing, Pakistani companies can attract international buyers and overcome their economic challenges.

4,"200,000 MTs of Russian wheat processed","Remaining wheat to be handled is around 250,000 MTs","Gwadar port has successfully handled 200,000 metric tonnes of wheat imports from Russia in just 25 days, according to a China Overseas Ports Holding Company (COPHC) official.
The rest of the wheat to be processed at Gwadar Port is around 250,000 metric tonnes. Four vessels, MV Lila Chennai, MV Rich, MV Veruda and MV Dorado, out of a total of nine carrying the wheat have already arrived at the port.
Gwadar Port saw zero handling loss for the discharge and dispatch of wheat since the first ship was anchored on March 2. All loading, offloading, and transportation have been handled with precision. Trucks loaded with wheat are exclusively using the Eastbay Expressway, which connects Gwadar Port with Makran Coastal Highway, bypassing the congested city roads of Gwadar.
The Eastbay Expressway which exclusively connects Gwadar Port to the Makran Coastal Highway, bypassing city roads, is the sole route being used for the movement of wheat-loaded trucks.
Previously the trucks used to squeeze through the congested city roads of Gwadar which not only added extra load on the city arteries but also impaired the flow of movement of trucks, said Haji Razzaq, a transporter.
Several organisations, including the China Overseas Ports Holding Company, Trading Corporation of Pakistan, Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Services Corporation Limited, Pakistan Customs, National Logistics Cell, Gwadar Free Zone, and GITL, are working together to keep operations running smoothly.
The Ministry of National Food Security and Research official said that NLC has been transporting wheat through the shortest and most feasible route to PASSCO storage centers to lift the assigned quantity of million metric tons of wheat under G2G arrangements from Gwadar Port. Passco storages are located in 13 Zones and 16 Districts of the country.
The remaining wheat stock is being stored in open Gunjees in scientific ways and procedures. ECC, in its meeting held on July 28, 2022, allowed the import of wheat through the Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) and directed MNFS&R to submit a logistic plan of Passco for transportation of imported wheat for consideration of ECC.
The import of wheat using Gwadar Port is a new milestone and will spur up trade activities and boost employment opportunities, according to the Gwadar International Terminals Limited official.

5,BOI assures businessmen of minimising regulations,"Says laws will be relaxed, businesses will be consulted before bringing new rules","Board of Investment (BOI) Secretary Asad Rehman Gilani has said that the industry is bound to deal with 70 different types of regulators in the country, which shouldn’t be the case.
Speaking at the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), the BOI secretary pointed out that they had launched Pakistan Regulatory Modernisation Initiative (PRMI) in a bid to modernise the regulatory regime and prevent regulators from becoming rigid.
“One of the ways to do this is to ask all regulators to identify the regulations that have been in their rule books for 75 years and have become obsolete,” he suggested, adding that the applicable regulations should be entered into the BOI registry and the rest be removed.
Gilani emphasised that the laws under which notices were issued to businesses for minor infractions should be relaxed. He declared that excessive notices would be eliminated, regulations would be minimised and new regulations would be finalised after consultation with the business community. Under the PRMI, according to the BOI secretary, regulators will be trained in how to make regulations.
“It has been noticed that there are 20 to 22 regulators in the IT sector alone. We have created a registry, the purpose of which will be to file one application instead of going to different departments,” he said.
BOI will take clearance from all the 22 departments. “So far, 10 regulators have expressed their willingness to cooperate with us. After that, we will move to other sectors like pharmaceutical, steel, etc.” Talking about investment, Gilani said “we have to take care of domestic investment along with foreign investment. Our people established industries by working hard. Now, we have to nurture them.”
To promote investment, Invest Pakistan programme has been launched with support of the British government. “We want the business community to sit with us and help formulate five-year policies,” he stressed.
Speaking on the occasion, LCCI President Kashif Anwar said that Lahore Chamber had always emphasised the need to make rules and regulations simple as well as business-friendly so that business climate is improved and investors are provided all possible facilitation.
“This will definitely help in promoting ease of doing business,” he said, adding that the promotion of foreign and local investment was the need of the hour.
According to the Economic Survey of Pakistan, the ratio of total investment is 15% of GDP, “which is quite low.” The share of private investment is only 10% of GDP. “It has become inevitable to increase the ratio. We hope that BOI initiatives like Invest Pakistan will be helpful,” said Anwar.
Net foreign direct investment (FDI) in Pakistan was $2.6 billion in 2019-20, which decreased to $1.82 billion in 2020-21 and stood at $1.87 billion in 2021-22, which the LCCI chief termed extremely low in terms of requirement of the economy.
He was of the view that local investment could not go up until the problems of industries were resolved.

6,MNCs’ profit repatriation plunges 80%,They send to headquarters abroad just $225m as dollars become scarce,"Profits sent by multinational companies (MNCs) to their headquarters abroad slumped by 80% to $225 million in the first eight months (Jul-Feb) of current fiscal year mainly due to the shortage of US dollars in the domestic economy.
MNCs had dispatched $1.15 billion to their headquarters in the same period of last year, reported the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Monday.
Businesses are facing financial constraints in the wake of economic crisis and political instability, which have forced some of the foreign companies to suspend business activities fully or partially. These companies include global airline Virgin Atlantic and logistics firm DHL.
The International Air Transport Association (IATA), an association of global airlines, has reported that its member carriers are struggling to repatriate funds from Pakistan, which have accumulated to $290 million since January.
In response to queries of The Express Tribune, Pakistan Business Council (PBC) CEO Ehsan Malik said “the country faces an acute shortage of foreign exchange while a deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is not in sight.”
“In these circumstances, the SBP has to limit the outflow, be it through administrative control over imports or by delaying remittances of dividends, royalties and technical fee. This is a reason for the slow outflow of profits.”
Delay in remittances “sends a very negative signal to the potential (foreign) investors,” he pointed out.
Financial expert Adnan Agar was of the view that in addition to the slowdown in profit repatriation, Pakistan’s faltering economy had badly impacted business activities, which kept earnings low. “This is also a key reason behind the lower repatriation.”
He recalled that a number of foreign car manufacturing firms had been lying closed since long due to a virtual ban on the import of auto parts. Moreover, a notable drop in demand for petroleum products and electricity has dented their sales.
Of the total profit repatriation of $225 million, Hong Kong-based MNCs repatriated $84.3 million to their headquarters, followed by Chinese firms that sent home $34.4 million. US firms dispatched profits and dividends amounting to $26.3 million.
UK-based companies repatriated $15.1 million while UAE-based business concerns sent home $11.5 million.
Sector-wise, oil and gas exploration firms repatriated $87.5 million in profits and dividends to their homeland, followed by the mining and quarrying sector that sent $33.1 million. The power sector repatriated $32.2 million.
Malik elaborated “once the dividend is declared, the parent company records it as receivable at the rupee-dollar exchange rate on the date of declaration.”
However, if the remittances are delayed, the parent firm has to keep adjusting the amount receivable in dollar as the rupee continues to lose ground. It is difficult to explain this continuous change in exchange rate to the analysts abroad.
“This is why companies are seeking permission to dollarise the declared dividends even if remittances are not immediately possible. It can be done by issuing a special series of Naya Pakistan Certificates,” he suggested.
“Another way for the SBP is to allow the pending dividends to be treated as the ‘repatriable’ share of capital, which the parent companies will add to their investment in Pakistani subsidiaries or inject into other companies in the country.”
Malik said that the bulk of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Pakistan was not generating significant export earnings. “If it could, there would have been a stronger argument for prioritising repatriation of profits and dividends.”
One way for such companies to demonstrate responsibility is to start reporting year-on-year improvement in the impact on external account. This will include direct and indirect imports plus profits, royalties and technical fee payable to the parent/ group companies less exports.
“As more inputs are indigenised and exports grow, the negative impact on the external account will subside. Of course, not all MNCs can do this,” he said while suggesting a possible solution to the crisis.
When given a choice between receiving dividends and the local subsidiaries being accorded priority in the import of inputs, “I think most parent companies would opt for the latter,” he said.

7,Russia frustrated with Pakistan,Delay in establishing new SPV company becomes roadblock to oil import,"Pakistan’s plan to import crude oil from Russia has hit a roadblock due to the slow progress on the Pakistani side, disappointing Moscow.
Sources revealed to The Express Tribune that Russia had already expressed doubts over Pakistan’s initiative to import crude oil from Russia and had asked Pakistan to import one crude oil cargo first to indicate its seriousness.
However, in a recent development, Russia was frustrated to learn that Pakistan had not started the process it committed to Moscow to start the first shipment of crude oil. Pakistan had committed that it would set up a new Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) company that would be responsible for the import of Russian oil to Pakistani refineries. This state-run company would also handle all matters regarding the import and payment of oil. Islamabad, however, had not yet started work on this plan and had not registered the SPV, which irritated Moscow.
Pakistan had agreed to import one cargo of crude oil from Russia next month, but due to the delay in setting up the SPV, the first shipment was now expected to arrive in May.
Crude oil pricing
One of the most critical issues in the crude oil pricing negotiation with Russia is the G7 Oil pricing cap mechanism, which the United States has recently reminded Pakistan to follow to negotiate the best possible price. Sources say that there have been many complications in finalising crude oil pricing with Russia.
Arabian crude oil produces more diesel and less furnace oil, while Russian crude oil produces more furnace oil and less diesel, which will erode the incentives offered by Russia on crude oil trade. Pakistani refineries are already facing problems in consuming furnace oil after the country’s power plants shifted towards LNG fuel. Pakistan requires crude oil that produces higher diesel oil, which will increase costs and erode incentives on crude oil from Russia.
“Arabian oil produces 45% high speed diesel (HSD) and 25% furnace oil,” sources said, adding that, “Russian crude oil will produce 32% HSD and 50% furnace oil. If we take such a ratio, Pakistan will require higher discounts from Russia.”
Pakistani refineries are already facing problems in consuming furnace oil after the country’s power plants shifted towards LNG fuel.
“Where will the furnace oil go?”, asked the sources adding that low production of HSD will also add to the country’s cost, eroding the incentives on crude oil from Russia.
Oil industry
Sources have revealed that the federal government had not taken the oil industry on board to discuss this issue, suggesting instead that the oil industry be taken on board to finalise crude oil pricing with Russia.
If both countries sign a deal, Russia will emerge as Pakistan’s second-largest crude oil supplier after Saudi Arabia, exporting around 100,000 barrels of crude oil per day.
Since Pakistan faces a dollar crunch, it could be a challenge for the country to pay for Russian crude oil in the same currency. Earlier, a foreign company had offered a Pakistani refinery to import Russian crude oil, but the Pakistani banks had refused to make the payment. Russia has now agreed to receive payment in three currencies – Russian rubble, Chinese yen, and UAE dirham against the supplies of crude oil to Pakistan. Sources say that the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Russian counter bank are pondering over a payment mechanism for oil import in three currencies other than dollars.
Since the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine war, the world witnessed a shocking surge in the price of oil, with European Union countries facing a threat of petroleum product shortage during the current year.
Recently, almost all the sectors in Pakistan were confronted with the issue of opening of LCs. Experts say that it would be a significant relief for Pakistan if the country is successful in striking an oil deal with Russia and making payment in currencies other than the dollar.
In conclusion, Russia’s frustration over the slow progress on Pakistan’s side to start the process of importing crude oil from Russia has become a concern. The delay in setting up the SPV and the complications in finalising crude oil pricing with Russia have created difficulties in the process. It is essential for Pakistan to take the oil industry on board to finalise crude oil pricing with Russia and work towards striking an oil deal to benefit both countries.
