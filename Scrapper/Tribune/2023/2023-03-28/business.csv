1,"BRT, Malam Jabba cases likely to be reopened","Minister claims PTI govt ruined the economy, causing increased inflation in the country and especially in K-P","Caretaker Minister for Transport Shahid Khan Khattak has said that Bus Rapid Project (BRT), Billion Trees Afforestation Project (BTAP), Malam Jabba and other cases against the PTI government were being reopened. 
He hinted that caretaker chief minister Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) would soon write a letter to the relevant investigation agencies to probe alleged corruption in the pavement of banks of river Kabul in Nowshera and small dams in the province.
Addressing an open katcheri held at the office of the deputy commissioner Nowshera Kabir Afridi, the minister claimed that the PTI government has ruined the economy during its nearly 10-year rule that resulted in an increase in inflation and price hike in the country, especially K-P.
He claimed that there were still PTI’s remnants in bureaucracy, which were creating hurdles in the way of the provincial government, adding that politics on free flour should be avoided and all poor households should be given free flour bags in a dignified manner.
The minister said the PTI government during its tenure has recruited about 5,000 media influencers for its personal projection and paid salaries through taxpayer money while sitting in homes. He said that time would be required to clear the mess created by the PTI’s incompetent rulers in K-P.

2,Killing of leopards continues unabated,"DFO Khyber says security situation, lack of resources hinder conservation efforts","The incidents of killing of the endangered common leopard have been on the rise across Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P).
In Khyber tribal district alone, three leopard cubs have been killed as two cubs were poisoned to death or shot on February 15 in the far-flung area of Tirah valley and another one was hunted down in the Shalman area of Landi Kotal.
Last year too, two adult leopards were killed when they attacked livestock in the mountains of Hassan Khel and Darra Adam Khel.
These deaths have forced local residents to start a campaign for the protection of leopards on social media and the government is being criticized for its inaction.
In 2020 a common leopard was killed when it entered a village in the Matta tehsil of Swat.
Talking to The Express Tribune, DFO Wildlife Khyber, Abdul Halim Marwat said that the local population migrated to other districts due to militancy and as a result the population of common leopard multiplied rapidly in the forests but after their return human-leopard contacts were on the rise.
“Local resident rear livestock and when these leopards attack them, farmers often kill them. The wildlife department could not intervene due to the prevailing law and order situation,” he said.
He maintained that for the past one year, Wildlife Department has been expanded to the tribal districts but they are still faced with shortage of staff, buildings and financial resources so the field work is very limited.
“The man who killed two leopard cubs has been arrested and fined while the most recent incident in Landi Kotal is being investigated,” he said.
No scientific survey has been conducted in the tribal districts to ascertain the total number of common leopards and a plan to do so has been gathering dust for the past two years in the offices.

3,Flour millers demand regular wheat quota,Price of flour increased by Rs400 per bag in the local market due to the closure of the regular wheat quota,"Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Flour Mills Association while extending full support to free flour distribution among unprivileged people, has demanded a regular supply of wheat.
In a press statement issued here on Monday, the executive body of the PFMA held a meeting to discuss the latest situation of wheat quota.
Speaking on the occasion, the Chairman of the association Iqbal Ahmad Khan said the association fully supported the free flour distribution scheme launched by the government during the holy month of Ramazan.
However, he added, due to the closure of the regular quota of wheat for flour mills, the price of the commodity had been increased by Rs400 per bag in the local market.
The participants also mentioned that due to focusing on the provision of free flour among needy people, common people are suffering in obtaining the commodity in markets as a result of faulty government policy.
“Since K-P is producing only 20 to 25 per cent of wheat of its total demand it has created problems for ordinary people in obtaining the staple food,” the press release added.
It demanded of the government to ensure a regular supply of wheat to flour mills to overcome the shortage and pave way for the provision of the essential commodity to all the people.

4,K-P declines to take charge of PESCO,K-P govt urged federation to take steps for provincialisation of DISCOs,"The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has declined the Federal government's proposal to take over the financial and administrative responsibilities of the Peshawar Electricity Supply Company (PESCO) and urged the federation to take steps for provincialization of DISCOs.
In a letter written to Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif by the Chief Minister KP and available with APP, it was pointed out that PESCO was currently facing a huge shortfall of approximately Rs200 billion per annum along with Rs30 billion per annum in receivables.
At present, PESCO was enjoying a uniform national tariff due to the tariff differential subsidy which could be at risk if the existing structure of the power sector was altered, it said, adding that the KP province was under severe stress due to current law and order situation and militancy coupled with low economic and social indicators and could not take over PESCO.
The CM said that the proposal could be considered if power generation was handed over to KP along with the income from electricity generation which would entail handing over of all federally owned hydropower stations to the province.
The CM referring to a report of the ""Out of box solution committee"" headed by the Deputy Chairman Planning Commission, said that its report should be placed before the Council of Common Interest (CCI) in the next meeting for consideration.
He further proposed that a ministerial-level committee should be set up to deliberate upon the ""Provincialization of DISCOs"" for accommodating the viewpoints of the provinces.
The letter mentioned the poor financial and administrative conditions of the DISCOs.

5,Jirga bans women from flour distribution points,"Mismanagement, manhandling of women termed ‘dishonour’","At a time when provision of free wheat flour has provided a much-needed relief to the inflation-hit people across the country despite widespread mismanagement and fatal stampedes, a Jirga of Shalobar sub-clan of Afridi tribe has banned the visits of women to the distribution points in Khyber tribal district of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P).
A local Jirga, headed by Shalobar Qaumi Council chairman Syed Shah Afridi, announced on Sunday that only men would be allowed at the distribution centres.
The decision was taken after rumours spread that all women are provided free flour and thousands of women rushed to the distribution points despite the fact that only women registered under the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) are eligible.
When the women didn’t get free flour as rumoured, they staged a protest demonstration against the district administration by blocking the Pak-Afghan Highway.
“A Jirga was held in Bara in which the tribal elders decided that women would not go to the distribution points. They also announced distribution points for each locality and it was decided that people would go to their local points,” said a local resident while talking to The Express Tribune.
“It has been decided by the Jirga that women would not be allowed at the distribution points and only men of families which are registered with BISP could come to fetch flour,” he said, adding that the treatment of women at these points is viewed as a great dishonor.
All the women were asked to hand over their CNICs to their menfolk who would come and get the flour for them.
On the other hand, K-P Chief Secretary Nadeem Aslam Chaudhry ordered deputy commissioners to make separate queues and counters for disabled persons, women and senior citizens across the province so that they could get flour with ease.
He said that establishment of new free flour distribution centers would facilitate locals to get Ramazan package with ease and would also help in crowd management at the points.
To provide relief to the people, the chief secretary said he had been continuously visiting distribution centres for the fourth consecutive day.
He reviewed the facilities at distribution points established at PDA Hazar Khawani Park and Hayatabad Sports Complex.
He kicked off distribution of free flour from both the centers by giving away relief package to deserving people.
On this occasion, the chief secretary met with people and inquired about problems they faced in getting flour. He appealed to the public to cooperate with district administration and avoid chaos and stampede in case of technical failure in the system.
The chief secretary instructed administrative officers to personally monitor process of flour distribution to poor families, adding that difficulties in getting flour should be removed and adequate facilities should be ensured at distribution points for the people.
It may be mentioned here that dozens of people have been injured across the province in stampedes at distribution centres while five people lost their lives as result of these violent mobs across the province.
