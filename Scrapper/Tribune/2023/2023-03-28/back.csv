1,US distances itself from Khalilzad’s statements on Pakistan,State Dept spox says former diplomat's opinions do not represent Biden administration,"The former United States envoy for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, “does not represent US policy”, a State Department spokesperson has said, asserting that the Afghan-born diplomat speaks in his “personal capacity”.
The spokesperson, Vedant Patel, was responding to a question from a Pakistani TV channel reporter about the perception that his recent tweets about the political situation in Pakistan reflect the views of the US government.
“Mr Khalilzad is a private citizen, and any social media activity or comments or tweets that you might reference, those are done in his private capacity, does not represent US foreign policy, and he does not speak for this administration,” Patel told reporters at his daily news briefing, as he set the record straight.

3,Sanaullah won’t stay if there’s room for one: Imran,PTI moves IHC against interior minister for issuing ‘direct threats’,"Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan in response to recent remarks by Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah expressed his desire for both the parties to remain active in the political arena, saying that should the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) insist on the notion that only one party can exist, then Sanaullah will not stay.
On Saturday, the interior minister said in an interview with a private news channel that ""the country’s politics has been brought to the level where the existence of only one of the two [PTI and PML-N] is possible”.
Sanaullah also said that when the ruling party felt that its existence was under threat, it could go to any extent against its chief political rival—without considering “what is illegal or undemocratic”.
In an informal conversation with journalists outside the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday, Imran noted that if those supporting the government were to withdraw their support, the government would collapse.
When asked who was in power, Imran responded that the answer was well-known. He went on to express his concern over the rule of law in the country, citing the alleged kidnapping of Azhar Mashwani and the release and subsequent arrest of Hassaan Niazi.
Imran also stated that former prime minister Nawaz Sharif was likely waiting for his (Imran’s) disqualification or death before returning to Pakistan.
To another question about resisting arrests, the former prime minister said that if he had committed any crime, he would have obliged.
In light of Sanaullah's statements, the PTI chief filed an application against the interior minister for issuing ""direct threats"" against him and his party at the IHC.
Seeking the IHC's intervention on the matter, Imran requested the court to block his arrest and prevent the respondents from carrying out their ""plans"".
Notably, in addition to Sanaullah, the federal government, Islamabad IG and SSP operations had been made respondents in the case.
PTI Secretary General Asad Umar also issued a statement, saying that courts should take notice of Sanaullah's statements, adding that the party ""has no intention to threaten his existence"".
""We did not make any cases when we were in the government,"" he said. ""All cases against Sanaullah were National Accountability Bureau's references.""
He simultaneously lamented the crackdown on PTI workers, saying: ""Five hundred PTI workers have been arrested in Islamabad alone.""
Similarly, former minister and Awami Muslim League (AML) chief Shiekh Rashid also condemned the interior minister's remarks.
""They usurped the state,"" Rashid said, claiming that Sanaullah ""wants bloodshed in the country"".

4,Unregistered poor to also get flour: PM,"Says NADRA, PITB to include non-BISP deserving people","Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday said dedicated counters were being established for the needy people who were not registered with Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) for the provision of free flour bags at the distribution centres under Ramazan Package.
“A huge number of people, who are not registered with BISP, deserve free flour bags as they are also living below the poverty line,” he said while talking to media during his visit to a free wheat flour distribution centre in Rawalpindi.
He said NADRA and Punjab Information Technology Board (PITB) took up the challenge to include non-BISP people by proposing a solution to this issue and developing a system.
Under this system, he said the non-BISP deserving people would be eligible to get free flour from the separate counters after registering their names in the system.
The prime minister said from Tuesday (today), the people who have not yet received any flour bag, would be provided all three bags at a time so that they would not have to travel again for the purpose.
He also directed the authorities to accommodate people from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit-Baltistan (G-B) who were living in the Punjab.
He said this was the first time in the country’s history that free flour was being provided to deserving people, therefore the administration had to face a big challenge in the beginning but the process was getting streamlined.

He appreciated the Punjab government and Rawalpindi administration for their efforts to make the distribution process smooth and uninterrupted. “Their passion to serve the poor during fasting is praiseworthy,” he added.
He also appreciated the efforts of Punjab chief minister and chief secretary in the flour distribution process.
PM Shehbaz Sharif said despite huge economic challenges, the government was committed to working for the relief of the unprivileged segment of society.
He said the government was putting in full efforts to change the fate of Pakistan. He also called upon people from all walks of life to support the government in its pro-poor efforts.
He said he would also pay unannounced visits to the flour distribution centres across the province to ensure smooth distribution of the bags to the people.
Earlier, the prime minister met with the beneficiaries at the centre and inquired about the problems they were facing while receiving the flour bags.
The Rawalpindi commissioner briefed the PM about the distribution process and informed that four centers were working in the city.
The prime minister directed to resolve all the issues faced by the people at the earliest.

5,Talks on with foreign consultants to ‘restructure’ PIA,Rafique says two more trains will be upgraded,"Railways Minister Khawaja Saad Rafique has said that the Karakoram Express and the Karachi Express will be upgraded by June 30 this year.
Addressing a news conference on Monday, the minister said the trains would be upgraded on the Green Line pattern, adding that upgradation of the two trains would provide good travelling options to the passengers.
Rafique said that the process of outsourcing three airports was under way, adding that Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad airports would be outsourced.
He said the airports would be outsourced after competitive bidding. “PIA restructuring has to be carried out and the matter is being discussed with international consultants.”
He said that efforts were being made to provide restructuring roadmap in a few months besides starting its implementation.
Rafique hoped that in a few months, Pakistan airlines would start flying to the UK.
He said that special Eid trains would also be operated, adding that seasonal trains, Awam Express, Shalimar Express and Bahauddin Zakaria Express, would be run during summers.
He said, “We are planning to run a cargo train having a capacity of transporting 12,500 tonnes of cargo.”
He hoped that the branding initiative would help earn a handsome amount of revenue.
He said that the land of railways would be utilised for commercial purposes, as rules had been framed and sent to the cabinet and soon approval would be obtained.
Preparation for introducing solar system at stations, terminals, buildings, DS offices and headquarters was under way to reduce electricity expenses and soon the project would be announced.
The railways had decided to reduce freight fares by 10-15 per cent, he added. He said that Hirok bridge would be completed by coming April 15, adding that efforts were being made to make Sibi-Harnai section operational before the end of this fiscal year.
To a question, he said Nawaz Sharif remained in opposition for 19 to 20 years but not a single corruption case was proved against him. Terming Imran Khan “fascist”, he said that he had nothing to do with democracy.
He said Imran was in himself a “Sicilian mafia”. “Imran Khan is not a leader, he behaves like a gangster,” the minister added.
To another question, he said that it was unfortunate that democracy in the country did not strengthen in the way it should be.
He said that parliament would strengthen when all political parties would understand that they had to set aside their differences in the larger national interest. He stressed the need to stop levelling dirty allegations against each other.

6,"Rs74b given to flood victims under BISP, NA told",Minister says compensation cheques provided to 115 heirs,"Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Murtaza Javed Abbasi on Monday apprised the National Assembly that the incumbent government had provided Rs70-74 billion emergency relief to the flood victims from its own resources under the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP).
Replying to various supplementary questions during the Question Hour, he said compensation cheques to the legal heirs of 115 flood victims who lost their lives in Punjab had already been given while only three were remaining due to some clearance issues by respective deputy commissioners of the districts.
He said that the government had announced provision of Rs1 million to each deceased person, Rs500,000 and Rs250,000 for fully destroyed and partial destroyed houses in the flood, respectively.
He said the government had issued funds to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). The NDMA had received data of the houses destroyed in recent floods from the three provinces, while data from two federating units was still awaited, he added.
The fundamental responsibility to manage the disasters with all allied activities rested with the respective provincial and district departments, while the NDMA acted as national backup support at federal level, he said.
The minister said Pakistan's Disaster Management System was structured in a three-tier devolved system with the primary onus on provincial and district levels. The NDMA effectively coordinated the disaster-related activities with the provincial governments by extending due help under the NDMA Act on the direction of the prime minister and the federal government. He said the rates for loss of agriculture land and livestock had also been revised upwards.

7,Police escort ban on G-B chief minister challenged,Petition stated that it is “illegal” to prevent the police from providing security in other provinces," The interior ministry’s notification banning the Gilgit-Baltistan (G-B) Police from accompanying the chief minister and the governor's security to other provinces was challenged in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday.
The high court has asked the federal government to respond by March 29. Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani issued orders at the request of the chief minister.
In the petition, presented by lawyers Mian Ali Ashfaq, Qadeer Janjua, and Ahad Khokhar, it has been stated that the ministry has imposed a ban on taking police personnel to other provinces.
Orders have been issued regarding the security of the governor and chief minister, according to the notification, and the concerned province will provide security wherever the chief minister and governor go, it added.
The petition stated that it is “illegal” to prevent the police from providing security in other provinces along with the chief minister.
“A notification based on discrimination against Gilgit-Baltistan Police cannot be issued,” it stated.
The petitioner, therefore, requested that the notification of the ministry dated March 24 should be declared null and void.

8,"Per capita public debt stands at Rs216,709","Two ministers, Mohsin Dawar stage walkout from NA over non-release of ex-FATA funds","Minister of State for Finance Aisha Ghaus Pasha on Monday informed the National Assembly that per capita public debt stood at Rs216,709 by June 2022.
Replying to a query during the Question Hour, the minister said Pakistan had maintained a debt-to-GDP ratio at 73.5% during the period under review.
She said the country’s total public debt was Rs52,721 billion till December 2022, including domestic debt of Rs33,116 billion and external debt of Rs19,605 billion.
Ghaus said an amount of Rs50,120 million had been released to the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government so far during the current financial year 2022-23 to meet current and development expenditures of the erstwhile FATA (Federally Administered Tribal Areas).
Rs115,200 million (Rs 60 billion for current and Rs 55.2 billion for development) was allocated for current and development expenditures of the erstwhile FATA during FY 2022-23, she added. However, she said, no amount was earmarked for temporarily displaced persons (TDPs) during the current financial year.
Mohsin Dawar, Minister for Religious Affairs Mufti Abdul Shakoor and Minister of Overseas Pakistani Sajid Hussain Turi staged a walk-out of the house for not releasing development budget to the erstwhile FATA.
She said most countries relied on the debt inflows to fulfill the shortfall in available resources to fund the government budget. The government borrowed to mainly finance its budget deficit approved by the parliament every year which included the Public Sector Development Programme, running of the civil government, and more importantly to pay interest on loans taken in the past, she added.
Answering another question, the minister the government was committed to an interest-free economy, and the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) in consultation with the Finance Division was working to devise a policy for adopting interest-free banking instruments.
A committee had been constituted and deliberations were underway to prepare a transformational plan in that regard, she added. The committee comprised officials from the SBP, Finance Ministry, Islamic and commercial banks, and Ulema as the entire financial system would have to change, she said.
The minister said Islamic Banking witnessed an impressive improvement in the country in recent years.
