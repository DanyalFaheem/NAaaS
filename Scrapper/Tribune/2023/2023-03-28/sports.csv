1,Two critically injured by police firing,"DPO suspends three personnel, orders inquiry","Police opened fire on three friends who had been on their way home after having Sehri at a restaurant. Two of them were seriously injured. 
The DPO suspended three police personnel and ordered an inquiry against them. 
Ali Haider, Noman and Adnan had Sehri at a restaurant on Kashmir Road within the limits of the Muradpur Police Station. 
When they were going home, the police personnel opened fire on them from a police mobile. 
The bullets hit Ali Haider and Noman, injuring them seriously. According to relatives, Adnan miraculously escaped unscathed, but he was taken to an unknown place by the police. 
Meanwhile, the injured were admitted to the Allama Iqbal Teaching Hospital where their condition was said to be critical. 
The DPO of Sialkot, Syed Zeeshan Raza, took notice of the incident and suspended ASI Abdul Qayyum, Head Constable Akbar Baig and Driver Constable Nasir Mehmood and tasked an SP with conducting a probe into the incident. The DPO said that legal and departmental action would be taken against those responsible.
In January 2021, four police personnel were arrested in Dijkot after they opened fire at unarmed occupants of a vehicle who had failed to pull over at a checkpoint on Samundari Road, killing one man and injuring three others.
The victim, Sardar Muhammad Waqas, a resident of Chak 475/GB, was traveling with three passengers in a car when he was signaled to stop by the policemen at the checkpoint and were shot at when they did not comply.
Dozens of relatives of the slain man protested by setting tyres on fire near the Lorry Ada, blocking the road for traffic. The then IGP of Punjab, Inam Ghani, had taken notice of the incident and sent officials to the spot to investigate the matter.
An initial investigation report submitted to the IGP revealed that the police personnel had misused their power and shot dead the driver of the car. 
Four policemen, ASI Shahid Manzoor, Ghulam Dastagir, Usman Hamid and Mohsin Sufiyan, were put behind bars at the Samanabad Police Station and a case registered against them. Police also handed over the body of the victim to his family after postmortem examination.
According to the First Information Report (FIR), the personnel also desecrated the body. Sources said that the patrolling police personnel carried the corpse around for four hours in a bid to cover up the matter.
Reportedly, 35-year-old Waqas was on way to his village from Faisalabad in a car when patrolling police personnel signaled him to stop. When the driver did not stop the car, they chased him and shot at the vehicle. The victim tried to escape the gunfire near Chak 258/RB but the cops shot and injured him critically, which led to his death.
A four-member committee had been formed to probe into the matter in detail.
The postmortem report had revealed that the victim had been shot in the abdomen and he passed away due to excessive bleeding.
The victim’s grandfather, Nazir Ahmed, had appealed to the then prime minister to ensure justice and punish the killers.

3,LHC upholds Naqvi’s appointment,Declares ECP has the right to name caretaker chief minister,"The Lahore High Court’s (LHC) Justice Shahid Karim on Monday dismissed a plea challenging the appointment of Punjab caretaker Chief Minister Mohsin Raza Naqvi.
The court observed that the appointment of the caretaker CM has been made in accordance with the law. According to the court, the ECP has the right to appoint the caretaker CM.
As the proceedings commenced earlier today, the lawyer representing the federal government told the court that in a situation where a caretaker CM misuses his powers, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and the courts are present.
He argued that the electoral watchdog has stopped the implementation of several orders passed by Naqvi and maintained that “it is purely the ECP’s jurisdiction to appoint the caretaker CM.”
Justice Karim remarked that a caretaker CM could not do anything as long as the ECP is “neutral and sovereign”.
The petitioner’s counsel advocate Azhar Siddique told the court that no due process was adopted by the ECP in the appointment of the Punjab caretaker CM.
“Several measures taken by the caretaker CM are against the real essence of the constitution,” he argued and requested the court to set aside the impugned notification through which he was appointed as CM, declaring it as illegal.
The petition was filed by Awami Muslim League (AML) chief and former interior minister Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed, through advocate Siddique, against Naqvi over his alleged affiliation with Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Co-Chairperson Asif Ali Zardari, Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) and active involvement in the regime change movement against the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).
The petitioner’s counsel implored that since the ECP and its members have violated the constitutional and statutory requirements vis-à-vis appointing the Punjab caretaker CM, it be censored and held guilty of violating its constitutional position and committing misconduct, hence the same be declared to be partial and incapable to hold a “free and fair election”.
He submitted that Mohsin Naqvi’s name was put forth by the present regime on account of his “close association” with the current ruling elite, particularly Zardari and the Sharif family, and his “political enmity” against the opposition.
The petition stated that Naqvi has been involved in the regime change against the PTI and is actively working for the PDM, adding that he had been involved in a case of corruption and corrupt practices initiated by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) where he struck a plea bargain, voluntary return under section 25 of the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO), 1999 and is thus a convicted person.
According to Section 15 of NAO, where an accused person was convicted of an offence under Section 9 ibid, he shall forthwith cease to hold public office and he shall stand disqualified provided further that any accused person who has availed the benefit of Section 25 ibid shall also be deemed to have been convicted for an offence under NAO and shall stand disqualified for public office.
According to Section 5 (n) of NAO, a holder of public office refers to a person who has been the president of Pakistan or the governor of a province, is or has been the prime minister, chief minister, speaker, deputy speaker, minister, advisor, etc.
The plea noted that the Supreme Court in a suo moto case had held that if a person is accused of corruption or corrupt practices and volunteers to offer to return the amount he has pocketed or gained through illegal means, they cannot hold any government/public office.

4,ATC grants remand of Imran’s nephew,The judge approved a two-week judicial remand but rejected the police’s request for a physical remand,"An Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) on Monday sent PTI Chairman Imran Khan’s nephew Hassaan Niazi to jail on a 14-day judicial remand in the Zille Shah murder case and also approved his two-day transit remand to transfer him to Karachi in another case.
On March 26, the Punjab police had transferred Niazi from Quetta to Lahore in connection with a case registered against him at Lahore’s Racecourse police station. He was brought to Quetta from Islamabad on Saturday morning, and despite being granted interim bail in the Quetta case, Niazi remained imprisoned for the day.
Amid tight security, the PTI leader appeared in ATC Judge Abher Gul Khan’s court today. During the hearing, the investigation officer requested a physical remand for Niazi, citing the need to carry out a photogrammetric test and recover his laptop and mobile phone. 
The IO alleged that Niazi was responsible for the attack and commotion and all incidents needed to be investigated. 
Niazi’s lawyer argued that his client was a well-known lawyer and PTI leader and was falsely implicated in the case. After the arguments were presented, Judge Gul reserved the verdict and announced it when the hearing resumed. 
The judge approved a two-week judicial remand but rejected the police’s request for a physical remand.
