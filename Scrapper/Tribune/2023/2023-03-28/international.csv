0,PTI wins two seats in HMC elections,Voting process at concerned polling stations was stalled due to clashes during the January 15 LG elections,"Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) secured two out of four seats in the voting for union councils (UC) 28 and 35 of Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (HMC) to elect chairmen, vice chairmen and ward councillors for which voting took place on Sunday.
Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and an independent candidate managed to win one seat each, according to official results.
The voting process in these polling stations was stalled due to clashes during the January 15 local government elections in Hyderabad. The clashes erupted between the workers of the PPP and PTI outside the polling stations in UC-28 and UC-25. 
A PTI worker, Ali Hingoro, was manhandled in the former UC while aerial firing was heard during the vote count. The PPP's Asfand Mari and Muhammad Jibran were the successful pair in UC-28. In UC-35 PTI's Naeem Sameeuddin and Muhammad Salman Khan emerged victorious albeit with a slender margin of 20 votes over the PPP candidates. They bagged 1,284 votes while the PPP candidates Syed Ghulam Mustafa Shah and Sanober Iqbal got 1,264 votes.
The PTI's candidate, Tahir Ayub, also won the seat of general member from ward No 3 of UC-35, getting 468 votes while PPP's Muhammad Saqib polled 322 votes. 
An independent candidate, Ashraf Ahmed, won the ward No 1 of UC-28, by getting 380 votes.
The LG elections were conducted on 155 out of 160 seats of chairmen and vice chairmen in the HMC because of deaths of the candidates in five UCs. 
The Election Commission of Pakistan announced results of 153 UCs as the polling process was stalled in UC-28 and UC-35 on that day. Among the 153 constituencies, 96 had gone to the PPP and 40 to PTI. 
After the addition of one more seat by the two parties, the PPP now has 97 UCs and PTI 41. The former is set to elect its mayor but the PPP has still not declared its candidate for the position.

1,SHC hears plea over domicile condition for nursing courses,Petition challenges govt's policy limiting admission criteria at JPMC to only Sindh domicile holders,"The Sindh High Court admitted on Monday a plea challenging the 2022 admission policy of the government to allow only people having domicile of the Sindh province to apply to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) School of Nursing and Jinnah College of Nursing.
The Sindh High Court (SHC) issued notices to the federal government, the JPMC executive director, and principals of Jinnah College of Nursing at the Jinnah Medical and Dental College and JPMC School of Nursing.
The lawyer of the petitioner said that the two nursing institutions entertained applications from students of every region of Pakistan under a quota system for admission in all degree and diploma courses. 
However, from 2022, ‘quota’ seats were no longer set aside for students of other provinces, while the admission required included the condition that only those with Sindh domicile would be given admission. 
The petition requested that the domicile requirement should be removed from the admission policy.
The court issued notices to parties concerned and sought their replies.

2,NICVD: A lifesaver for children with congenital heart disease,"Institute’s network conducts an average of 1,500 pediatric open-heart surgeries each year","Congenital heart disease (CHD), a heart defect or abnormality present in newborns, is a term that strikes fear in parents whose children are affected. Congenital heart disease is often associated with insurmountable medical expenses, emergencies, endless appointments, and persistent anxiety. 
Pakistan has one of the highest global rates of CHD, disproportionately affecting the poor. Factors such as malnutrition, inadequate maternal health, and frequent pregnancies contribute to its prevalence. Dr Abdul Sattar Shaikh, the head of pediatric cardiology at National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD), warns that most children with CHD will not survive their first year if left untreated.
With roughly 60,000 new CHD cases annually in Pakistan, most patients previously had to seek treatment abroad, often in neighbouring countries like India. Public institutions in other provinces typically have waiting lists of 6-12 months for procedures. The Sindh Government assumed control of the NICVD program in 2015, after the passage of the 18th Amendment, with Dr. Nadeem Qamar becoming the executive director. Under the leadership of Pakistan People’s Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the hospital’s pediatric department has undergone a revolutionary transformation. NICVD is now the sole comprehensive children’s heart center in Pakistan. 
Over the past five years, around 600,000 children have been treated, an extraordinary number for any institution worldwide. The NICVD network conducts an average of 1,500 pediatric open-heart surgeries and 2,000 interventions and minimally invasive procedures each year, using cutting-edge technology. In contrast to other provincial children’s hospitals, NICVD treats critical patients within a week and moderately stable patients within one to two months. Remarkably, all these services are entirely free of charge, while private hospitals charge Rs1 million to Rs2 million per patient on average.
The institution serves the entire country, with over 50% of CHD cases coming from outside Sindh, including Balochistan, southern parts of Punjab, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The NICVD pediatric department has also treated patients from Iran, Afghanistan, UAE and Oman.
Offering comprehensive pediatric cardiology services, the NICVD network provides everything from diagnosis to treatment. These services include 24/7 pediatric emergency services, open-heart surgeries, interventions, catheterization, and echo and fetal echo services. Full services are available in Karachi, Hyderabad, Tando Muhammad Khan, and Sukkur, while OPD, emergency, and echo services are offered in Mithi, Larkana, Nawabshah, Khairpur, Sehwan, and Lyari.
The NICVD network has implemented the CHD registry program, registering families with CHD history, and offering maternal screening, diagnosis, and counseling. This enables early detection of symptoms in pregnant mothers and encourages preventative measures. The network also educates and trains general practitioners and pediatricians across the province through seminars and lectures. Further, a 300-bed pediatric cardiology building is currently under construction and is expected to be operational within two years, significantly increasing patient capacity and reducing wait time.
The remarkable progress made by the NICVD network in recent years has provided hope and solace to countless families affected by congenital heart disease in Pakistan. By offering accessible, comprehensive, and free-of-cost treatment, NICVD has become a beacon of hope for children and their families, overcoming economic and geographical barriers. The ongoing expansion of facilities and the dedication to early detection, education, and prevention demonstrate NICVD’s unwavering commitment to improving the lives of those afflicted by CHD. As this vital institution continues to grow and evolve, it not only exemplifies the power of compassion and innovation in healthcare but also serves as an inspiration for other countries to address the needs of their most vulnerable citizens.

9,‘Suo motu’ not specifically mentioned in Constitution: Palijo,Demands equal justice for political prisoners from all provinces without discrimination,"Qomi Awami Tehreek President Ayaz Latif Palijo has called upon the Supreme Court to decide all matters related to Article 63-A of the Constitution through a full bench. 
Palijo, a senior advocate who also teaches law, emphasised the need to deal with cases pertaining to disqualification of politicians on grounds of party defection through a full bench.
He also demanded equal justice for political prisoners from all four provinces without any discrimination based on domicile or political party's popularity. 
Palijo contended that the Constitution does not specifically mention ""suo motu"" jurisdiction. ""Therefore, if the Chief Justice of Pakistan takes a suo moto notice, the matter should be judged by a bench of not less than five justices"", he said. Palijo emphasised that the CJP should not be a part of such a bench under the principle of natural justice, which states ""nemo judex in causa sua.""
Palijo also demanded that the general elections of the National Assembly and all four provinces should be held on the same day. He suggested that the apex court should constitute a larger bench to revisit and review its old politicised decisions, including the death penalty given to former Prime Minister and Pakistan Peoples Party's (PPP's) Chairman Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto under Article 188 of the Constitution.
Article 188 of the Constitution reads: ""The Supreme Court shall have power, subject to the provisions of any Act of [Parliament] and of any rules made by the Supreme Court, to review any judgement pronounced or any order made by it.""
