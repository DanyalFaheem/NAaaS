0,Netanyahu suspends judicial overhaul after day of Israeli turmoil,The United States welcomed Netanyahu's action,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu paused his signature plan to overhaul Israel's judiciary after a day of nationwide turmoil when workers joined a general strike against the proposal and hundreds of thousands of protesters took to the streets.
The plans by his nationalist religious coalition to hand control over judicial appointments to the executive while giving parliament the power to overturn Supreme Court rulings has ignited one of the biggest internal crises in Israeli history.
Announcing his decision late on Monday to suspend the plans until parliament returns after the break for the Passover holiday and Independence Day next month, Netanyahu said the crisis required all sides to act responsibly.
""Israeli society is on a dangerous collision course. We are in the midst of a crisis that is endangering the basic unity between us,"" he said in a prime-time television address.
As he made the address, huge crowds had gathered in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, including a large counter-demonstration by right-wing supporters of the overhaul. Their presence prompted fears of possible violence between the two sides but the evening passed with no reports of major violence.
While Netanyahu and his supporters say the plans would ensure a proper balance between the elected government and the judiciary and would not endanger individual and minority rights, they have drawn sustained and furious opposition.
For months, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets of Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and other cities to protest a project its critics say would destroy the checks and balances protecting Israeli democracy.
Netanyahu, currently on trial on corruption charges which he denies, had previously promised the overhaul would not pose a threat to individual rights but had given no sign of giving way on any of its essentials.
The decision to suspend the overhaul followed an extraordinary weekend in which Defence Minister Yoav Gallant was sacked after warning the divisions caused by the plans had affected the military and were threatening national security.
His dismissal by Netanyahu led thousands to take to the streets and Israel's President Isaac Herzog to urge a halt.
The Histadrut trade union organisation called a general strike that prompted flights from Ben Gurion airport to be suspended and businesses from banks to McDonald's fast-food restaurants to close.
An early rally in Israel's shekel currency fizzled out after Netanyahu suspended the overhaul with its eventual fate uncertain.
Coming at a time when Israel faces a prolonged security crisis in the occupied West Bank as well as rising tensions with Iran, Gallant's dismissal had appeared to many a sign that the government had set aside the national interest.
While opposition parties gave a cautious welcome to Netanyahu's decision to suspend the overhaul to allow time to reach an agreement, many protesters remained mistrustful.
""I will continue protesting until these reforms are completely dropped, because this isn't a set of reforms, this is a coup by the executive,"" Eitan Kahana, a 27-year-old demonstrator in Jerusalem said.
Within his own coalition, there was also some unhappiness, with hardline Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich declaring the decision to suspend the overhaul was a mistake but promising to accept the prime minister's decision.
Arab broadcasters carried rolling coverage of the Israeli crisis with some Arabs saying they hoped it would lead to Netanyahu's political demise and others expressing hope of more far-reaching consequences for Israel.
The United States welcomed Netanyahu's action.

1,ECC defers handing over airports to foreign country,Clears Rs6.2b payment as part of Reko Diq mines settlement deal,"The government on Monday did not endorse an advisory service agreement with an arm of the World Bank Group for handing over Pakistan’s three international airports to a foreign country due to objections raised by some cabinet members.
The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet, which deferred the approval of the agreement, cleared Rs6.2 billion payment as part of Reko Diq mines settlement deal.
It also authorised to take Rs65 billion loan to make share payments by the federal government on behalf of the Balochistan government. Finance Minister Ishaq Dar presided over the ECC meeting.
“The ECC deferred a summary of the Ministry of Aviation on engagement of International Finance Corporation (IFC) as transaction adviser for the outsourcing of three airports,” according to the Ministry of Finance.
In 2019, Qatar had shown interest in taking over the management, operation, and development of the New Islamabad International Airport, Lahore’s Allama Iqbal International Airport and Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport.
The aviation ministry adopted a dilly-dallying approach and was delaying the transaction under different pretexts for the past many years.
In December, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif instructed to hire the IFC as transaction adviser and outsource the airports in three months – a deadline that had lapsed.
The sources said that some cabinet members questioned the motive behind bringing the transaction advisory service agreement in the ECC, saying it was not the right forum.
Other members objected to certain clauses of the draft agreement.
The IFC – an arm of the World Bank Group – is being hired to prepare a transaction structure for the outsourcing of the airports at a consultancy cost of around $4 million.
The members also objected to imposing penalties on the IFC for missing the milestones.
Pakistan has been struggling to arrange $6 billion loans to meet a condition by the International Monetary Fund for reaching a staff-level agreement.
The Pakistan Democratic Movement-led government also enacted a new Inter-governmental transactions law to fast-track sale of national assets to raise additional funds. But it had yet to conclude even one transaction.
The government had adopted a so-called fast-track route to hire the IFC under the Public-Private Partnership Authority Act, 2017. The PPPA regulations provide for the hiring of IFC as a transaction adviser through direct contracting subject to the approval of PPPA Board. Almost three months ago, the PPPA Board allowed to directly engage IFC as a transaction adviser for outsourcing the operation of the three airports.
The Civil Aviation Authority Board approved the draft Transaction Advisory Agreement early this month subject to legal vetting by the Ministry of Law and Justice.
The ECC was informed that the board observed that since the TASA was based on success fee model with penalties for failure to proceed with the transaction on the part of the client, there was a need for strong political commitment for the outsourcing of the operation of three target airports “from our side”.
“In view of the past experience, a clear demonstration of such a commitment will also be crucial not only for the completion of this process,” according to the CAA Board.
However, some of the ECC members were of the opinion that after the PM Office’s commitment there was no need for seeking any other commitment.
Reko Diq payment
According to the finance ministry, “The ECC approved a summary regarding arrangement of finance facility for funding of Balochistan government’s share of obligation in Reko Diq project dispute settlement.”
It also gave directions to the Finance Division to arrange payment of mark-up amounting to Rs6.2 billion for the period from March 31, 2022 to December 30, 2022 to the NBP for the short-term finance facility of Rs65 billion.
The ECC also authorised the finance ministry to finalise a new finance facility of Rs65 billion for a seven-year term at six-month KIBOR Rate with the NBP, which currently stood at 22%.
The Ministry of Finance would issue the sovereign guarantees to arrange the loan from the NBP after the last short-term facility expired in December 2022.
The liability of the previous Short-Term Finance Facility of Rs65 billion would be cleared through a new finance facility.
The repayment of finance facility would be made directly by the Finance Division through budget allocation.
In 2019, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) slapped a total $6.5 billion fine on Pakistan and in favour of the M/s Tethyan Copper Company Pvt for the country’s failure to implement the Reko Diq copper-gold mineral resources development project.
As a result of a settlement with the foreign investors, Pakistan agreed to pay $900 million to TCC along with the interest in addition to giving 50% stakes to Barrick Gold Corporation in the Reko Diq project.
The remaining 50% was equally distributed between the federal and provincial governments.
Pakistan already paid $900 million along with interest payable at an annual rate equal to the US Prime Rate plus two percentage points for the period from July 2022 till December 15, 2022 to Antofagasta as consideration for the acquisition of Antofagasta's shares in the Reko Diq project as per terms set out in the Antofagasta Exit Deed.
Separately, the interest amount earned from HSBC Bank would also be payable to Antofagasta.
The federal government was providing the requisite share of funding on behalf of the Balochistan government through market financing, raised against the Government Holding Private Limited balance sheet.
An amount of $12.7 million for the government share towards interest payable to Antofagasta for the period up to December 15, 2022 was deposited in the designated Escrow Account from the said loan of Rs65 billion.
Medicine prices
The ECC considered a summary of the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination for maximum retail price of Remdesivir 100mg injection for the treatment of Covid-19.
It endorsed the policy board’s recommendation to keep price of Remdesivir 100mg injection intact at Rs1,892 per vial.
The ECC deferred summaries of the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination on fixation MPR of 54 new drugs and increase prices of 119 drugs due to lack of preparedness of the health ministry.

2,"PTI, govt lock horns in parliament","JUI-F chief Fazl said if parliament can call the army chief, the judges should also be called","Parliament on Monday became a noisy fish market as the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ended its long boycott and participated in the joint session, slamming the federal government for its unlawful action against its leaders and workers.
The house reverberated with slogans of “watch thief and diesel, diesel”.
During the session, journalists protested against the police torture of Express News journalist Saqib Bashir and terrorism cases against a private TV channel’s journalist, staging a walkout from the press gallery.
Opposition Leader in the Senate Shahzad Waseem criticised the government and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for their recent decisions.
Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman targeted the PTI and judiciary, saying that if parliament could call the army chief, the judges should also be called.
“The function of the Supreme Court (SC) is to deliver justice and not to interfere, and while the apex court is authorised to interpret the Constitution, it is not allowed to write it,” he added.
The joint session of parliament was chaired by National Assembly (NA) Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf.
At the beginning of the meeting, PTI lawmakers raised slogans against the government while participating in the meeting after a long boycott.
The government and opposition members chanted slogans against each other's leaders, ignoring the instructions of the speaker.
The opposition leader in the upper house, while speaking in the joint session on other important issues, including law and order, said that while the nation was busy looking for the moon of the holy month of Ramazan, the ECP’s moon came out in the middle of the night “which brought darkness to the nation”.
The opposition leader said that the Election Commission in its midnight decision, going against the decision of the Supreme Court, refused to hold the election on the date given by it and gave a new date.
He said that the Election Commission gave an excuse in its decision that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was not allowing the release of funds for the election, while it was a different matter that the international lender immediately clarified that it was Pakistan’s decision and there was no such restriction from it.
He added that the Election Commission gave another excuse that the security situation was not good, but the speaker was aware of the difficult situation the country was going through.
Waseem said that journalism was considered to be the main pillar of the state. “Today, look at the restrictions on their language and expression,” he pointed out.
“The oppression that they are going through, the abuses that are taking place, the independent voices are being stifled … what the journalists can do if they cannot even walk out in protest as they just have a camera and a pen,” he wondered. “There is no cannon or sword in their possession.”
He said that elections were held despite the rise in terrorism. He added that there was a war between Iran and Iraq, but elections went ahead in Iran. Similarly, he said, Turkey was shaken by an earthquake, but they still expressed their desire to hold polls.
“Where there are democratic thoughts and attitudes, one does not run away from elections, just as a believer does not run away from death,” he added. “Similarly, a politician does not run away from elections.”
The PTI senator added that the authorities had brought the nation to a crossroads.
On the one hand, the decision of the judiciary had been rejected, while on the other, the procedure given in the Constitution had also been rejected, he pointed out.
“This is an insult to the Constitution and also a violation of the Constitution. This matter is no longer a matter of any party or only Tehreek-e-Insaf, it is a matter of the state and the people that which path they have to choose,” he remarked.
“Should we follow the path of holding elections whenever our heart desires, or should we hold elections according to the Constitution?” he asked.
He said that the Supreme Court rejected the decision of the speaker of the lower house, which resulted in the formation of the incumbent government.
“That decision did not suit us, but we accepted it. We must create a tradition of accepting decisions if we want to strengthen the institutions,” he added.
Waseem said that accepting the decision was a far-fetched thing, but they saw that a systematic campaign had started.
“There were a lot of videos against the judiciary, against the judges, pictures were released and placards were raised in this house. We do not talk about liking or disliking a judge,” he remarked. “We talk about the institution, the institution makes a decision. It is not a personal decision of anyone.”
He wondered that if they did not abide by the Constitution in parliament, how would the state function.
“If the administration and the state will not work in this way, what will be our future? The Constitution establishes a relationship between the people and the state where your life and property, honour and dignity and your fundamental rights will be protected,” he added.
The senator said that no one was safe at the moment, as anyone who spoke was being put in jails and tortured in custody.
“Today, the spirit of this house is also wounded. What hope can the people have from it, which cannot protect its members?” he asked the lawmakers.
“Does it reflect democracy? Which Constitution and law allows it?” he continued to pose questions.
He said that they had seen fascism in Punjab in recent days, and the protesting Pashtuns were called terrorists.
“Are you doing any service to the country in this way? Those Pashtuns are still shedding their blood for the country. Let them be attacked by drones, shed their blood, and watch it flow and still you call them terrorists?” he said.
The PTI lawmaker recalled that the caretaker Punjab chief minister said that they would break hands. “I ask the caretaker chief minister not to break hands but to join hands and seek forgiveness for doing injustice to this nation,” he remarked.
The opposition leader said that the authorities had brought the country's economy to the point where they threw dust in the eyes of the people.
“How many lives have been lost, how many people have lost their lives in the stampede?” he asked, adding that they announced a subsidy on petrol and then sat still until the IMF intervened.
“This is their style of government. This country is not running as it cannot be run in this way. At this time, there is a need to put personal interests aside and go for national interest,” he remarked.
Waseem said that political parties did not break the relationship with the people, but under the leadership of Imran Khan, the PTI had taken this political struggle to a new level.
“When Imran calls, people reach despite the obstacles,” he pointed out. “You cannot beat passion. People listen to him as his words have an impact. He is not talking about himself, instead he is talking about his people and his country.”
Federal Communications Minister Maulana Asad Mehmood, while participating in the discussion, said that Benazir Bhutto was martyred, parliamentarians were martyred, but so-called human rights organisations came to the field for Imran.
“We will not allow international agents to operate in Pakistan,” he said.
He called on the speaker to summon the judges. “Sometimes, it is said that the decision of the party leader is final and sometimes, it is said that the decision of the parliamentary leader is final,” he added.
Mehmood said Ali Wazir was sent to jail. “We do not interfere in the domain of the Election Commission or the Supreme Court, but the Supreme Court's job is to give justice and not to interfere,” he added.
If the army chief can be summoned to the committee, then the judge of the apex court can also be summoned, he said, adding that everyone knew who created the economic crisis.
The speaker adjourned the joint session of parliament till 11am on April 10.

3,PM calls for ‘balancing scales of justice’,"PM says nation 'divided, confused' and no one holding 'favourite' Imran Khan accountable as institutions exempt him","Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday urged the National Assembly to enact a legislation to reduce the powers of the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP), saying that the voices from within the judiciary were a “new ray of hope”.
Addressing the National Assembly, Shehbaz called for balancing the scales of justice, saying that the leadership of the incumbent ruling party was shown no leniency when it faced “fake cases”, but at present, former prime minister Imran Khan continued to enjoy “immunity from the rule of law”.

The prime minister asked the parliamentarians to decide, categorically, if they wanted to continue with the prevailing “law of the jungle” in the country or legislate for upholding the rule of law.
“Today is a watershed moment, and it is important for parliament to legislate on the matters concerning the country,” he told the lawmakers.
“Today, the fight is between democracy and fascism… It is high time that we take a decision with collective wisdom,” he added.
“Today, this Constitution has become a joke and the country is suffering from a dire situation. We need a categorical decision whether we want to give relief to the nation or the ‘favoured one’, who did not abide by the law. We have to decide for the future of the nation and take guidance from law and the Constitution.”
Shehbaz addressed the National Assembly a day after two Supreme Court judges – Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail – issued a 27-page order, stating that the suo motu case regarding the Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) elections date was dismissed by a majority of 4-3.
Read PTI, govt lock horns in parliament
The two judges aimed to “revisit the power of the one-man show enjoyed by the office of the chief justice of Pakistan” in order to “strengthen” the institution and “ensure public trust and confidence” in the apex court.
In his address, Prime Minister Shehbaz described the “the 4-3 decision” a ray of hope. He said that the senior leadership of his Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) faced imprisonment and no leniency was extended to them in the fake cases registered against them.
On the other hand, he added, PTI Chairman and former prime minister Imran Khan continued to enjoy immunity from the rule of law despite his persistent blackmailing and abuse of the judiciary.
He charged that Imran had the habit of not appearing before courts and he frequently mocked the judiciary, but was still getting bail extensions. “Every court is granting him extension. He [Imran Khan] has given a long innings. Is this the scale of justice,” he asked.
He also criticised former prime minister Imran for pushing the country to the brink of economic default by violating the promises made to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which led to a serious economic crisis.
Imran, the prime minister continued, misguided the public through his so-called “regime-change” narrative, but later took a U-turn on his own stance.
“The hypocrisy is at its height as Imran Khan has now hired a US lobbying firm and is holding meetings with diplomats.”
The prime minister accused Imran of creating a big divide in the country, lamenting that no one was questioning him.
“A liar and non-serious person incurred a big loss to the country. The biggest fraud in the country’s history deceived the public in the name of the State of Madina.”
However, he assured that the government would not allow Imran to cause any further damage to the country. “Law will take its course and this non-serious person will not be allowed to incur further damage to the country,” the prime minister told the house.
He regretted that Imran was openly criticising the brave armed forces, and making the enemies of the country happy. During Imran’s tenure, he said, terrorists returned to their safe havens. He urged parliament to take firm action against all the wrongdoings of Imran.
“As a Pakistani, a parliamentarian and as the head of the government, I request the house to take urgent notice of the situation that Imran Niazi has created,” he said. “Imran is trying to bury the Constitution. Parliament needs to take solid action, otherwise history will not forgive us.”
Shehbaz said talks with Imran were not possible until he apologised to the nation for the ills he created. “If he genuinely wants to sit down for negotiations, he should first seek forgiveness from the nation for his wrongdoings,” he said.
Regarding the audio leaks of a purported conversation of a Supreme Court judge, the prime minister requested the superior court for a forensic of the audio. “Politicians are put in jails in no time, but how many judges have been ousted on corruption,” he asked.
“The parliamentarians need to decide if they will act as a herd of cattle or have the audacity to decide about their future themselves,” he said, adding that the country faced a difficult situation even after 75 years of its establishment. “Only the rule of law can help address this crisis.” (WITH INPUT FROM APP)

4,‘One-man show’: CJ’s discretionary powers in spotlight,Questions being raised on top court’s moral authority,"Differences and mistrust among judges of the top court, especially the continuous questioning of the discretionary power exercised by the chief justice to form benches in the sensitive and politically high-profile cases, have started to erode its moral authority -- the very foundation on which it stands.
The Express Tribune has learnt on good authority that the federal government would request a five-judge larger bench to refer the matter to the high court for adjudication after the issuance of the two judges’ judicial order, wherein they held that the suo motu case regarding the announcement of the date of holding the Punjab Assembly election is dismissed by the bench 4:3.
However, Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial has already made it clear that the apex court is adjudicating a new legal question as to whether the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) could annul the date of elections given by the president.
Former Sindh High Court Bar Association (SHCBA) president Salahuddin Ahmed says that back in 2017, the All Pakistan Bar Representative Conference in Karachi resolved that the chief justice’s discretionary power to initiate suo motu, form benches and fix cases needed to be structured and regulated.
“By now, at least half a dozen top court judges have stated the same in their judgments and speeches,” he added, highlighting that chief justices have been adamant against any curtailment of their absolute powers.
“As a result, we now see references to judicial imperialism and one-man shows in Supreme Court judgments,” the legal expert said.
He also said that in England, the House of Lords (now the United Kingdom Supreme Court) typically sits in benches of five. “But in the two most recent important political cases (i.e., the withdrawal of the UK from the SC & Boris Johnson’s illegal proroguing of parliament), a maximum of 11 judges sat together to gain from the collective wisdom of all judges,” he highlighted.
""The vehement resistance to the reasonable suggestions to form a full court to authoritatively decide such matters and avoid allegations of partisanship seems quite baffling to me,” Ahmed said.
Commenting about the prevailing situation after the issuance of two judges’ order, former additional attorney general Tariq Mahmood Khokhar said that the script is familiar as a CJP is isolated with diminished authority and dignity.
""The Supreme Court is under siege from within and without. The reference against Qazi J, the fixation and non-fixation of cases, the constitution of benches, and case markings are some of the known contentious issues. Political polarity has also played its role. Full court hearing(s) will be a step back from the brink. At this critical junction, this nation needs a united Supreme Court. In 1997 a CJP was devoured. Hope history will not repeat itself,” said Khokhar.
He also agreed that inflexible integrity is the secret of moral authority. A fissured institution debases its integrity, he added.
It is being witnessed that the apex court is facing an unprecedented widespread perception that differences among its senior judges are growing starker in the light of recent unusual events – a festering issue that many anticipate might worsen.
A slew of public statements and retorts — and the ensuing controversy — that capped the top court's judicial year has further deepened this perception, raising the eyebrows of many who say the extraordinary sequence of events indicates the court of last resort is divided into camps.
Apart from other issues, the supposed two camps are facing a brewing mistrust.
It is understood that Justice Qazi Faez Isa's case has severely affected the working of the apex court. The proceedings in the case have negatively affected the relationship between SC judges, who expressed their differences through judicial orders, speeches, and letters.
This is in many ways unprecedented as no such divisions were witnessed during the era of former CJP Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry under whom no judge had ever dissented on any crucial issue.
Although some clashes between the top court’s judges came to the fore during the ex-CJP Mian Saqib Nisar's tenure, the CJP handled the situation tactfully.
However, Justice Isa had raised serious questions over the manner in which public interest litigations were initiated by the human rights cell of the top court during Nisar’s tenure. He had also expressed serious concerns over the dissolution and reconstitution of a bench by CJP Nisar at the SC’s Peshawar Registry on May 8, 2018.
After seven months, another judge, Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, called into question the May 8 reconstitution of an apex court bench and called the decision ‘unwarranted and unprecedented’.
A senior lawyer says that it is almost impossible that conflict among SC judges will end in the prevailing situation.
However, he urged both sides to work together for the betterment of institutions otherwise history will not remember them in good words.

5,CJ throws out AGP’s objection to bench,Chief Justice Bandial observes ECP has no authority to extend election date,"Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial on Tuesday overruled the objection raised by Attorney General for Pakistan Usman Awan about the bench hearing the PTI’s petition as a ""technical point"" to be raised in a separate application.
The apex court resumed hearing on a PTI petition challenging the Election Commission of Pakistan’s decision to postpone the election to the Punjab Assembly till October 8.
A five-member larger bench, headed by the chief justice, and comprising Justice Ijazul Ahsan, Justice Munib Akhtar, Justice Aminuddin Khan and Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail is seized with the matter.
“Elections are necessary for democracy … don’t spoil the matter on technical grounds,” the chief justice told the AGP. “The Supreme Court’s March 1 order has already been implemented. Don’t raise this matter or present it in court again.”
At the outset of the hearing, the chief justice welcomed General of Pakistan (AGP) Usman Awan and said that the court looked forward to receiving assistance for him.
Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail on Monday had cast doubt on the judgement handed down in the March 1 suo motu regarding elections in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab, saying that the proceedings stood dismissed by a majority of 4-3, and contended that the chief justice of Pakistan did not have the power to restructure benches without the consent of the respective judges.
The attorney general, while mentioning the dissenting notes of brother judges, questioned the maintainability of the petition. He argued that the matter related to the election should be referred to the Lahore High Court after two apex court judges issued their detailed opinion wherein they held that the earlier suo motu in the matter was dismissed 4:3.
He said that the LHC had not given the president the authority to announce the election date. The AGP also requested the court to constitute a full bench to adjudicate the case.
However, the chief justice Bandial held that the opinion expressed by the two judges was not relevant in the instant matter.
""If the verdict was 3:4, then the 'breached' orders do not exist,"" responded the attorney general. ""In fact, if there were no court orders, then the president had no authority to give an election date even,"" he added, urging the court to first settle the issue of Supreme court’s March 1 orders.
The chief justice observed that the AGP's arguments were based on a ""technical point"" while the bench was seeing the question raised in the application.
He also asked the AGP to refrain from “complicating"" the matter by asking questions that would delay the proceedings.
The chief justice asked Awan to raise such points in a separate application, saying that the issue before the court was not about ""the fixing of the election date; rather the postponement of the election date"".
Moreover, Justice Manokhail pointed out that “the number of judges [who issued] the March 1 judgement is Supreme Court’s internal matter”.
Reacting to the comment, the chief justice thanked Justice Mandokhail for “clearing the matter”.
Read ‘One-man show’: CJ’s discretionary powers in spotlight
Tuesday’s proceeding was mostly consumed by the question whether the ECP as a constitutional body mandated to alter the election date and that too beyond the 90-day limit on its own.
On the matter, Federal Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar maintained that the ECP is independent of all orders. ""We had said it on the first day, the verdict is 3-4,"" said the minister as he reached the SC premises, ""the ECP was merely doing its job as per Article 218(3)"".
The chief justice observed that prima facie the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) “has no authority to extend election date”.
The chief justice observed that the present case was a completely different matter wherein, the apex court was examining whether the ECP had the authority to postpone the election date.
“We don’t want to stretch the matter,” he stated and said that the question in front of the court was simple: Can the election date be extended or not? “If the ECP has the authority [to extend the date] then the proceedings end right here.”
Justice Mandokhail remarked that the court would examine how the ECP was empowered to extend the election date.
Justice Aminuddin Khan questioned whether the election schedule could be ""reduced to less than 90 days"", while Justice Ijazul Ahsan observed that the ECP ""has the right to adjust the election schedule within 90 days"", but added that it could not exceed the 90-day limit.
""Ninety days have been surpassed even now,"" observed Justice Mandokhail, adding that polls ""must take place under all circumstances but now the question is who will exceed the election date beyond the 90-day limit"".
""The other question is, should an assembly be dissolved at the whims of one person alone,"" remarked Justice Mandokhail.
The chief justice pointed out that the security personnel in K-P conducted the highest number of operations. He revealed that 61 operations in Punjab, 367 in Sindh and 1,245 operations were conducted in K-P.

“The situation in Punjab is different than that in K-P,” the chief justice noted and gave the example of Turkiye, where he said elections were being held in all the areas that were not struck by the earthquake.
Barrister Zafar concurred and said that even the Election Act, 2017, highlighted that polling could only be cancelled in areas where problems existed. “It is not possible to postpone the entire elections.”
The judge stated that the polls could only be delayed if an emergency was imposed [in the country]. “Does the ECP order mention imposing an emergency?” he asked to which the PTI lawyer replied, “absolutely not”.
“Absolutely not was said by you [the PTI] to someone else,” the chief justice quipped, which led to laughter in the courtroom.
Discussing the paucity of funds to hold the election exercise, the chief justice proposed a pay cut for himself and other judges so that the “vital task” of holding elections across the country could be funded and completed.
“An entire budget is not required for elections … the government can cut back its expenditures and release Rs20 billion,” he said. “A Rs20 billion cut can be made in the salaries of judges.”
The chief justice highlighted that the country was in the midst of economic turmoil today and emphasised that sacrifice was needed to deal with the crisis. “A five per cent salary cut can cover the expenses of elections,” he said.
Justice Ahsan also questioned how could it be determined that the problems that existed today would not be there on October 8 as well.
The PTI lawyer replied that the ECP had said that it was not provided with funds for the elections to which Justice Akhtar stated that he had read a statement given by the prime minister in newspapers.

“The federal government says that Rs500 billion tax was collected till February … it is surprising that out of Rs500 billion, Rs20 billion couldn’t be given [for elections],” the judge pointed out.
Barrister Zafar recalled that in its order, the ECP had quoted the finance secretary as saying it would be difficult to release the funds. “It is to be noted that Finance Ministry had used the word difficult, not rejected [the request].”
Justice Akhtar said that the finance secretary had stated that it did not have funds for elections today and in the future. “This means that elections will not take place at all. How can a government secretary issue such a statement?”
He also noted that after it was collected, the tax was deposited in the federal consolidated funds.
PPP’s Naek contended that federal consolidated funds were only spent with the approval of the Parliament to which Justice Akhtar asked: “If the assembly is dissolved, will the funds not be released?”
The lawyer replied that in the present scenario, a National Assembly was functioning, elaborating that a new assembly could approve the expenditure. “Only the ECP could provide an explanation for the finance secretary’s statement,” he added.
Justice Mandokhail also asked how the finance secretary could disburse funds beyond the approved budget to which Barrister Zafar said that this was a technical point.
""What would happen if the ECP reverses its decision and says nobody is supporting the electoral body in holding elections,"" inquired Justice Mandokhail.
""The commission will have to turn to the court to resolve the difficulties it faces,"" the judge observed.
Later, CJ Bandial questioned how elections could be delayed ""for such a long period"" by the electoral body.
""When Benazir Bhutto was martyred, elections were only delayed by 40 days,"" the judge observed, noting that at the time ""protestors had set the ECP offices on fire"" and ""the entire country was in the grips of demonstrations"".
The CJ stressed the need for ""political stability"" and ""maturity"" to hold elections.
""The ECP's decision was drafted with haste,"" he remarked, ""the commission had no authority or legal provisions available to extend the election date"".
PDM to become party in case
Meanwhile, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Senator and former law minister Farooq Naek prayed that political parties be made party to the case, arguing that they were also ""stakeholders"" in the issue at hand.
Earlier, coalition parties in government decided to become parties to the case, whereby PPP, PML-N and JUI-F are expected to file their applications.
