He said that the unlawful action had both angered and disappointed locals in general and traders in particular.\nHe said that such brazen display of weapons by an armed group could again disturb the peace of the valley while their trade would also be affected as Eidul Fitr was approaching.\nHe said that people of Tirah reserved the right to question the ability of the law enforcement agencies for their failure to check the unauthorised movement of such armed groups.\nThe so-called Bazaar-Zakhakhel peace committee is a splinter group of banned Lashkar-i-Islam, which was considered a sign of terror in Khyber from 2005 to 2012.\nThe group dissociated itself from LI around 2007-8 after developing differences with its chief Mangal Bagh and named itself as Tauheedul Islam. The two rival groups then fought some fierce battles against each other, which claimed lives of more than 100 people from both sides.\nTauheedul Islam later struck a deal with the security forces and transformed its self into a peace committee while taking control of the important and lucrative trade route passing through Bazaar-Zakhakhel tribal region. The group is still instrumental in controlling the entire area and outsiders cannot enter the region without its permission.\nPublished in Dawn, April 11th, 2023\n"}, "Link": {"0": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1746988/enforcement-of-constitution-must-for-progress-anp", "1": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1746987/women-teachers-to-be-posted-to-hometowns", "2": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1746986/bajaur-admin-vows-to-make-census-more-accurate", "3": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1746985/two-auto-thieves-passerby-killed-in-swabi-encounter", "4": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1746984/peshawar-teaching-hospitals-receive-fewer-patients-in-ramazan", "5": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1746983/dera-man-dies-after-suffering-heat-stroke-at-flour-distribution-point", "6": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1746982/one-injured-in-hand-grenade-attack", "7": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1746981/proclaimed-offender-held-after-38-years-of-hiding", "8": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1746994/locals-foreigners-participate-in-jeep-race", "9": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1746993/peshawar-prison-police-tear-gas-rioters-during-shifting-of-inmates", "10": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1746992/caretaker-cabinet-for-holding-na-pa-polls-on-same-day", "11": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1746991/five-injured-in-attack-on-swabi-police-station", "12": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1746990/four-ttp-terrorists-arrested-in-dera-operation", "13": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1746989/tirah-tribesmen-protest-armed-intrusion-of-peace-committee"}, "Category": {"0": "peshawar", "1": "peshawar", "2": "peshawar", "3": "peshawar", "4": "peshawar", "5": "peshawar", "6": "peshawar", "7": "peshawar", "8": "peshawar", "9": "peshawar", "10": "peshawar", "11": "peshawar", "12": "peshawar", "13": "peshawar"}, "CreationDate": {"0": "2023-04-11", "1": "2023-04-11", "2": "2023-04-11", "3": "2023-04-11", "4": "2023-04-11", "5": "2023-04-11", "6": "2023-04-11", "7": "2023-04-11", "8": "2023-04-11", "9": "2023-04-11", "10": "2023-04-11", "11": "2023-04-11", "12": "2023-04-11", "13": "2023-04-11"}}
