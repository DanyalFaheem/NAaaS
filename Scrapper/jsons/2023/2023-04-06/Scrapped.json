The statement, however, lauded the role of provincial governments in ensuring the coverage of areas under respective administrations.\n\u201cThe provincial governments are playing a major role in ensuring 100pc coverage while ensuring the quality and credibility of the whole census process,\u201d it said. \u201cThe real-time data progress monitoring dashboards, provided by PBS down to provincial and district governments, allows for a completely transparent process and continuous oversight of field operations. The dashboard also helps provincial governments in identifying any abnormalities, any areas missed and any other emerging anomalies on a daily basis.\u201d\nIt also shared the methodology based on \u201cuniversal inclusion,\u201d which ensures the area of every individual who\u2019s counted depending on their livelihood.\n\u201cThe current methodology ensures universal inclusion, which means that each and every individual living in the location for six months or planning to live there for another six months, and will be using resources around that location, regardless of their nationality, geography, ethnicity, identity, affiliations, politics, caste or creed, will be counted,\u201d the PBS said.\nThe PBS has also supported the provincial and district governments by setting up a helpline 080057574 and SMS gateway 9727 where people can call for queries or report anyone or any area missed.\n\u201cRecently, on the directions of the prime minister of Pakistan, the 495 census support centres are now also working as points of referral for all missed areas,\u201d it added.\nPublished in Dawn, April 6th, 2023\n", "1": "LAHORE: Chinese Co\u00ad\u00adn\u00ad\u00adsul General in Lahore Zhao Shiren has hailed the China-Pakistan Eco\u00adn\u00adomic Corridor (CPEC) as a tra\u00adn\u00adsformative infrastructure project that paved the way for socio-economic development in the country.\nHe was speaking at the concluding ceremony of an essay competition held in connection with the completion of 10 years of CPEC on Wednesday.

They were holding party flags while some of them were wearing PTI-themed headbands and scarves.\n \n\n\nAddressing his supporters, the former prime minister said, \u201cThe nation should wait for my call to ensure that the incumbent rulers could not run away from holding elections; otherwise, neither the history nor the future generations will pardon this generation for not waging jihad against the forces undermining the rule of law.\u201d\nHe said \u201cthe Sicilian mafia\u201d was now standing against the decision of the Supreme Court, which had earlier decided in their favour and overturned PTI\u2019s decision to dissolve the National Assembly after opening courts at midnight.\nThe former premier said \u2018absconder\u2019 Nawaz Sharif and Asif Ali Zardari were sitting in London and Dubai, respectively, and taking decisions about the fate of Pakistan. He said the incumbent rulers were also trying to divide the Supreme Court while also working to create a rift between the PTI and the establishment which \u201cmight repeat events of 1971\u201d.\nAsking what kind of economic and security stability can be ensured by October for holding elections, Mr Khan said that only elections would be the way out to take Pakistan out of the blind alley where it was fast heading. \u201cI will complete interviews and selection of candidates in 10 days,\u201d he said and added that the nation would not let the incumbent rulers run away from elections.\nIn an interview with Al Jazeera before the speech, the PTI chairman alleged the ruling PDM could violate the Constitution to prevent national elections due later this year. \u201cThey are just scared of the elections and are even willing to violate the Constitution,\u201d Mr Khan claimed.\n\u201cBy not accepting the SC\u2019s verdict, the government would violate the Constitution\u201d. In such a situation, he said, the SC could slap contempt of court on them.\nMr Khan disclosed he had held two meetings with former army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa and wanted to work out how to hold elections. \u201cWhat I didn\u2019t realise was that he wanted an election provided he gets an extension in his tenure,\u201d he said and added since then he had no conversation with the establishment.\nAnswering a question about his plans on restructuring the civil-military relationship if elected back to power, the PTI chairman said Pakistan needed to change. \u201cThe current civil and military imbalance has to change if we want Pakistan to get out of this mess,\u201d he asserted.\n\u201cYou cannot have a system where the prime minister has the responsibility but he does not have the authority to implement his policies because that authority is shared with the military,\u201d the PTI chief observed.\nPublished in Dawn, April 6th, 2023\n", "3": "ISLAMABAD: In a significant development, the National Tax Council (NTC) on Wednesday approved the much-awaited Place of Provision of Service Rules (PPSRs), a step towards harmonising general sales tax on services across the country and ultimately easing the doing of businesses.\nHarmonising GST on services is a condition of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to unlock funding to Pakistan stalled since December despite implementing several tough policy decisions, in\u00ad\u00adcluding additional tax measures.\nAfter approval of the respective provincial cabinets, the PPSRs will come into effect from May 1. The Sindh Revenue Board (SRB) suggested implementing the rules from July 1, while the other three provincial revenue authorities wanted the implementation from mid-April.\nThe government is in a hurry to get loans from multilateral lenders to shore up its falling foreign exchange reserves and the early implementation of the World Bank project could give some breaking space to Pakistan.\nAs a result, the early implementation of the rules will pave the way for the release of a $1 billion programme loan under the Resilient Institutions for Sustai\u00adn\u00adable Economy (RISE) programme of the World Bank. The programme loan is vital for Pakistan keeping in view the country\u2019s balance-of-payments issue and a considerable delay in getting a $1.1bn tranche from the IMF.\nThe service rules are also a step forward towards facilitating ease of doing business.\nAn official announcement of the finance ministry said the NTC approved the recommendations of its executive committee regarding draft PPSRs. The approval will help achieve the prior actions for the World Bank-funded programme.\nThe meeting approved the exclusion of electric power transmission from the list of Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) goods and it will now be treated as a service. It was decided that it would be implemented from July 1 following the amendment to the Sales Tax Act through the Finan\u00ad\u00adce Bill in the upcoming budget.\nThe SRB has already proposed ru\u00ad\u00adles for the provision of services re\u00ad\u00adlating to electric power transm\u00adi\u00ad\u00adssi\u00ad\u00ado\u00ad\u00adn.

GST on TV and radio ads will be based on the location of the beaming stations.\nIn the case of still media, GST will apply to the location of hoarding sites, while in the case of advertising agents, the tax will be collected based on the location of the agent\u2019s office or branch.\nIn the case of different insurance services \u2014 life and health insurance, insurance of immovable property, insurance agent, re-insurance agent, re-insurance imported and re-insurance local \u2014 the GST on services will be based on the location of the office or branches of the insurance company providing services.\nThe provinces agreed that GST would apply based on the location of the franchise. They also agreed on a formula that half of GST will go to the province of origin on tra\u00adnsportation of goods other than pe\u00adtroleum services provided by co\u00admpanies while the remaining half will go to the destination province.\nIn the case of non-companies, the GST will be based on the location of the booking office on transportation of goods other than petroleum services.\nHalf of the GST will be on the origin of transportation of goods through pipeline or conduit and transmission through the electrical grid, while 50pc tax will be ap\u00ad\u00adplied to the destination province.\nPublished in Dawn, April 6th, 2023\n", "4": "ISLAMABAD/LARKANA: PML-N chief organiser Maryam Nawaz Sharif urged the chief justice of Pakistan to get the nod of his fellow judges for the execution of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the Punjab Assembly polls delay case.\nMeanwhile, in Gambat, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari accused judges of ignoring past injustices and regretted that the CJP was not unwilling to share his powers with fellow judges.\nMs Sharif\u2019s remarks came a day after the apex court quashed the Election Commission\u2019s order of delaying polls to October and set May 14 as the election date in Punjab.\nAddressing the lawyers\u2019 convention in the Judicial Complex of Rawalpindi org\u00adanised by the PML-N Lawyers\u2019 For\u00adum, Ms Sharif termed the decision of a three-member bench of the apex court comprising CJP Umar Ata Bandial, Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Muneeb Akhtar \u201ca minority decision\u201d, saying that four judges had already dismissed this case.\n\nChief justice not ready to share his powers with fellow judges, regrets Bilawal\n\nShe alleged that the recent Supreme Court order was part of a sequence of decisions taken against PML-N by former chief justices Saqib Nisar and Asif Saeed Khosa in collaboration with former spymaster Faiz Hameed.\nShe accused Mr Hameed, who retired last year as a lieutenant general, of blackmailing judges to get \u201ctailor-made\u201d decisions.\nMs Nawaz pointed out that the CJP took suo motu notice on the note of a two-member bench comprising Justice Ahsan and Justice Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi on polls in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab assemblies.\nMr Sharif said that one judge was a \u201cmonitoring judge\u201d in cases against her and father Nawaz Sharif, and was also connected with a controversial lease to high-rise apartments \u201cOne Constitution Avenue\u201d developed by the real estate developer BNP (Pvt) Ltd.\nThe judge was among the legal team of the said builder and was also part of the apex court bench that restored the lease of the multibillion-rupee plot.\nThe PML-N leader also urged the Supreme Judicial Council to take notice of Justice Naqvi\u2019s purported audio leak.\nMeanwhile, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Wednesday also accused judges of not dispensing justice while ruling the country in collaboration with dictators.\nSpeaking at the inauguration ceremony of the country\u2019s first lung transplant unit in the Gambat city of Khairpur district, he said the CJP was not ready to share his powers with fellow judges.\nIn contrast, he said, former president Asif Ali Zardari was the country\u2019s most powerful civilian president, but \u201che gave all his powers to the parliament\u201d.\nThe foreign minister lamented that judges gave lectures to the entire country about who was corrupt and who was the Sicilian mafia, but the same courts sentenced PPP founder Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to death and no judge was ready to do justice in this regard until today.\nHe alleged that when the present CJP was the chief justice of the Lahore High Court, he had ordered the construction of Kalabagh Dam, ignoring the rights of small provinces.\nPublished in Dawn, April 6th, 2023\n", "5": "ISLAMABAD: Hitting out hard at the judiciary, a key government minister on Wednesday termed the \u201cimperial Supreme Court (SC) a menace to democracy\u201d and a \u201cusurper\u201d of the rights of all state institutions, as lawmakers in the National Assembly continued their one-sided assault on judges and the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) in the wake of the controversial verdict of a three-judge SC bench to hold elections in Punjab on May 14.\n\u201cThe law is a sword, shield and a menace.

He said after facing dictatorship and terrorism, they were now confronting an \u201cimperial Supreme Court\u201d.\nCriticising the judiciary for legitimising past military rules, the minister said there had been a \u201cnexus between the generals and the judges\u201d which had imposed \u201cthe doctrine of necessity\u201d on the nation.\nHe said they either had to struggle against the generals and when there was no military rule, they had to face the judges.

The opposition leader used street language and cursed the judges.\nThe opposition leader was directed by the speaker to select appropriate and parliamentary words in the speech. Later, he received flak from his own colleague and another PTI dissident Riaz Mazari, who advised the opposition leader not to talk like those sitting in hotels.\nReligious Affairs Minister Mufti Abdul Shakoor also hit out at the SC and suggested that the SC should now be called a \u201cPTI\u2019s wing.\u201d\n\u201cIs he the CJP or the PTI\u2019s vice-chairman?\u201d asked the minister while making another suggestion that it would be appropriate to place the ECP under the SC.\n\u201cWhen they [judges] are giving schedule and dates [for polls] then what is the need for having the ECP. Better merge the ECP with SC and make the CJP its head,\u201d he said mockingly.
