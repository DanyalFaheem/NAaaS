On the other hand, the allottees of the sector have been demanding development work and the CDA recently also called tenders for it.\nA few years ago, the civic agency proposed a site in Sangjani, but the environment body after receiving public complaints rejected the site. Later, the CDA proposed a site in institutional sector of H-16, but the IHC issued a stay order.\nSubsequently, the civic agency proposed a new site in its nursery at Park Road but received strong criticism as local people said flower germination can\u2019t go side by side with the dumping site. On Park Road, CDA has already launched its own three housing schemes of Park Enclaves and the fourth one exclusively for overseas Pakistanis is also in the pipeline. Therefore, the civic agency has dropped the plan of setting up a landfill site in the area.\nSources said that now the CDA was again focusing on H-16 and may plead before the IHC that for the time being it should be allowed to dump in the institutional sector as the planning wing had already earmarked a site in the sector.\n\u201cHonestly speaking, we are in a fix. Wherever we proposed a site, people started raising questions. Where we should go? Now, we have two plans - temporary and permanent. We will set up a temporary site in Islamabad while a permanent landfill site will be developed in Mandra in collaboration with Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA),\u201d said an officer of CDA.\nWhen contacted, CDA\u2019s spokesperson Syed Asif Raza said the civic agency had been working on both temporary and permanent plans.\n\u201cThe Mandra site, which will be a joint venture with the RDA, once developed will be the permanent solution,\u201d he said.\nPublished in Dawn, April 11th, 2022\n", "11": "RAWALPINDI: Inspector General of Police (IGP) Rao Sardar Ali Khan has sought details about arrest of proclaimed offenders across the province and action taken against them under section 88 of the Criminal Procedure Code (PPC) (attachment of their properties).\nAccording to law, property of any person, against whom a warrant has been issued by court and he/she has been absconding or has been concealing himself so that such warrant cannot be executed, is attached under the section of the PPC.\nOf the 5,483 absconders in Rawalpindi district, the properties of only 185 have been attached so far. The IGP has directed the police to inform his office with the progress/compliance report at the earliest.\nAccording to sources, a letter has been issued to the additional inspector general of police investigation, all regional police officers (RPOs), including RPO Rawalpindi Ashfaq Ahmad Khan, City Police Officer Omer Saeed Malik and the district police officers (DPOs) seeking progress on the attachment of properties of the proclaimed offenders.\nFollowing IGP\u2019s orders, RPO Rawalpindi Ashfaq Ahmed Khan has asked the CPO to expedite legal action for confiscating properties of such persons. The district police officers of Chakwal, Jhelum and Attock have also been issued orders.\nA spokesman for the Rawalpindi district police told Dawn that a total of 5,483 absconders were on record in Rawalpindi out of whom 2,870 had been arrested - 2,345 in 2021 and 525 this year.\nSimilarly, there are 185 absconders against whom legal action under section 88 had been completed. The attachment of their properties has been carried out and the legal process is underway for others.\nHe also said in criminal cases, police cannot begin an investigation unless the person named in the case has been apprehended. The accused as well as the victim do not benefit from a person\u2019s disappearance.\nBut in some cases, after committing gruesome and heinous crime, the accused persons managed to hide themselves for long time to defy the operation of law.\nIn one case, the accused against whom a murder case was registered remained absconded for 12 years and when he was arrested no penal action for absconding was taken against him except attachment of his property. Such persons deserve more punishment on account of defiance of the operation of the law besides the punishment prescribed for the offence committed, said a legal expert.\nHe said whoever being accused of an offence under this code or under any other law absconds or avoids arrest or evades appearance before any inquiry or trial or court proceeding or conceals himself and obstructs the course of justice and against whom a warrant of arrest has been issued by the court shall be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years or with a fine or both.\nPublished in Dawn, April 11th, 2022\n", "12": "TAXILA: Two people died while 13 others were injured in separate incidents in Taxila and Attock on Sunday. \nIn the first incident, a truck crashed into a passenger van near Margalla hills as a result of which two on board the van, including the driver, died on the spot while nine passengers were injured.
