including medical officers, emergency medical officers and specialists, appointed by the government to improve patient care in the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata), haven\u2019t been paid salary for four months with authorities blaming it on a lack of funds.\nOfficials told Dawn that those medics were recruited in April 2021 under the Accelerated Implementation Programme (AIP) to cater to the needs of the people in tribal districts.\nThey said the AIP was approved by the federal cabinet to employ staff members for many departments in the region after the tribal region\u2019s merger with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\nThe officials said the government had sanctioned 300 positions of medical officers with a monthly package of Rs200,000.\n\nOfficials insist funds not available to pay salary\n\nThey said 283 appointments were made but the doctors either resigned or were terminated for legal reasons bringing the tally down to 172.\nThe officials said the government had also announced 219 positions of emergency medical officers (EMO) with a monthly salary of Rs300,000, but the department didn\u2019t find the doctors in required number and filled 36 posts only.\nThey said under the same programme, 100 posts of medical specialists were approved against the monthly payment of Rs450,000, but only 18 of them were filled.\nThe officials said for the last five months, the appointees hadn\u2019t been paid salary due to the unavailability of funds with the provincial government.\nThey said the programme was meant to ensure the presence of doctors in tribal districts, where absenteeism was rife in health centres with the health department receiving scores of complaints about it from residents as well as local authorities.\nThe officials said most doctors opted for the programme jobs due to fat salaries.\nThey said the initiative led to the improvement of the healthcare system in the tribal region but things were no more working due to the denial of salaries to doctors.\nThe officials said the doctors had been paid late since their appointment due to the lengthy process of the verification of their educational documents by the relevant boards of intermediate and secondary education, Khyber Medical University, and Pakistan Medical Commission.\nThey said funds were not available to pay those appointees.\nWomen medical officers insisted that they\u2019re the most affected by delayed payments as their families depended on their salaries.\nThey said they opted for those jobs for better payments despite security concerns.\nA female medical officer told Dawn on condition of anonymity that it was very difficult for women to work in tribal districts but she and other female medics had to do so to earn for their families.\n\u201cWe demand the immediate release of salaries and regularisation of our services,\u201d she said.\nThe woman doctor said she and her colleagues were appointed to those posts in a transparent process, so the government should regularise their services to ensure regular payments to them like other government employees, who received salary at the start of every month.\nShe warned that any further delay in salary payment to doctors would hamper healthcare in tribal districts.\nAn unpaid EMO told Dawn that under the contract, he was appointed for a fixed amount of money and had to serve in the place of appointment, so the transfer wasn\u2019t possible.\nHe said the government could terminate the services of the AIP doctors anytime without assigning any reason.\nPublished in

notification issued by the chief secretary for changes to the Provincial Management Services Rules, 2007.\nThe petitioners include Civil Secretariat Superintendents, Assistants and Clerks Association president Zafar Khan, Information Technology Staff Association president Qaiser Khan and PS and PA Stenographer Association senior vice-president Tasawar Iqbal.\nThey said the notification changed the PMS Rules reducing 20 per cent share of tehsildars in PMS posts to be filled through promotion and assigning three per cent of it to the ministerial staff of the commissioner and deputy commissioner\u2019s offices instead of allocating the same for the secretariat staff.\nThe bench observed that as the petitioners had challenged amendments to the rules, it would be appropriate to issue a notice to the advocate general for response.\n\nPetition challenges allocation of PMS posts for members of ministerial staff\n\nLawyer Mohammad Farooq Afridi appeared for the petitioners and said the PMS Rules, 2007, were amended in an illegal manner as the mandatory cabinet approval wasn\u2019t there.\nHe requested the court to declare that notification illegal.\nThe lawyer also sought orders for respondents, including the chief secretary, to allot proportional promotion quota on \u201cstrength-based rationalisation\u201d in the PMS to the petitioners and other members of the Civil Secretariat\u2019s ministerial staff.\nMr Afridi said before the creation of the PMS, the province had two provincial civil service groups, including Provincial Civil Service Executive Group and Secretariat Group, which were governed by their respective rules.\nHe added that the government introduced the PMS in 2007 and formulated rules for its functioning.\nThe counsel said for filling the BPS-17 PMS posts, the government had allotted 50 per cent quota by initial recruitment through Public Service Commission and 50 per cent quota by promotion.\nHe said out of the 50 per cent promotion quota, 20 per cent was allotted to secretariat group comprising superintendents and private secretaries, 20 per cent to tehsildars and 10 per cent quota through in-service exam to the superintendents, private secretaries, personal assistants, assistants, senior scale stenographers, data entry operators and senior and junior clerks.\nMr Afridi said the Board of Revenue, the parent department of tehsildars, had sent a letter to the establishment department on Jan 10, 2019, suggesting reduction of the 20 per cent quota of tehsildars for being over and above the sanctioned strength of tehsildars.\nHe added that the quota was irrational, so half of it should be specified for members of his clients\u2019 organisations.\nThe lawyer complained that the respondents notified reduction of the tehsildar quota by three per cent and awarded it to private secretaries and superintendents of the commissioner and deputy commissioner offices to \u201caccommodate three favourites of the

conducted by the public sector Small and Medium Enterprise Development Authority (Smeda) and NGO Centre for Governance and Public Accountability (CGPA).\nThe study titled \u2018Barrier to Start,

launched on barriers to growth of businesses\n\nAccording to it, the overall precarious law and order situation has impeded business activities in the city.\nThe study said a lack of collaboration among industry, academia, research institutions and government departments was hindering development of entrepreneurship in the province, so there should be a joint platform for government institutions to combine their synergies to boost business innovations, discuss their problems, and come up with financially viable projects.\nIt added that boot camps for new entrepreneurs should be arranged by the relevant government departments and they should be linked with investors for seed funding.\nThe study called for internship schemes in industries and business to provide youth with entrepreneurial experience and equip them with regulatory, evaluation skills and technical knowledge.\nIt said entrepreneurs struggled to acquire industrial plots for new businesses due to the unavailability of land in the provincial capital\u2019s industrial zones, so they operated from housing colonies to create problems for residents. The model is also not commercially viable for entrepreneurs due to lack of business amenities, it said.\nThe study said keeping the local and export potential in view, dedicated zones should be set up for marble and granite, furniture, leather and footwear, honey processing and packing, carpet weaving, and gems units with training facilities and modern machinery.\nThe study pointed out a lack of awareness of laws, rules and incentive schemes by the government.
