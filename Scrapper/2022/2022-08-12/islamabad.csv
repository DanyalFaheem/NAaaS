1,Plot files confiscated as new probe into ‘fraudulent’ allotment in Islamabad's I-11 launched,"""The allegations are that 11 plots have been allotted with backdated signatures of various officers,"" CDA official says.","ISLAMABAD: Files were confiscated on Thursday by security directorate of the Capital Development Authority (CDA) as probe into new alleged fraudulent allotment of plots in sector I-11 continues, Dawn has learnt.
According to sources, after receiving a complaint, Member Estate Naveed Ilahi, a few days ago, directed the security directorate to conduct preliminary probe of 11 plots of sector I-11, which were allegedly allotted with backdated signature. “Yes, security directorate confiscated some files of sector I-11 on Thursday. After probe it will be clear, if these plots were allotted in accordance with rules or fraudulently. The allegations are that 11 plots have been allotted with backdated signatures of various officers,” said an official of CDA.
It is relevant to note that a couple of years ago, over 100 such allotments in sector I-11 and I-12 based on backdated signatures surfaced and the security directorate had pointed out that a detailed investigation must be carried out. However, so far, neither the said over 100 plots were declared cancelled nor action was taken against anyone, in fact the detailed inquiry has still not been completed.
Earlier, in 2017, the CDA introduced a new policy stating that in the future, no plot would be allotted to those affected by land acquisition on pick and choose basis and all such allotments would be made through balloting. For this, the CDA had prepared lists of 800 plots available in the sectors and had allotted around 250 plots through balloting while the remaining plots were kept in record for the future.
Later on, no balloting was carried out which signifies that the plots that were kept in CDA’s record in 2017 should be available as vacant. However, a large number of plots that were shown as vacant, particularly in sector I-12 in 2017 were marked as allotted in later years. 
Some officials alleged that since these allotments were made fraudulently, questions about authenticity of some of the files were raised. A few years ago, the security directorate had confiscated record of seven fraudulent files of an I series sector from One Window Operation (OWP), minutes before their transfer. The case was referred to Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) as well, which last year, registered a first information report (FIR) related to one plot while a probe is still going on into the remaining files.
Meanwhile, last month CDA management formed a committee headed by deputy director general estate to probe alleged fraudulent allotment of seven plots of sector D-13 within 10 days. This scam surfaced earlier this year, when then additional director land Sobia Toru, pointed out her fake signature on some files. Sources said that probe of the D-13 scam is near completion.
An official said that in past, some corrupt elements in land directorate of CDA with the support of property dealers used to mint money in pick and choose base allotments, but after 2017, when this practice was stopped and balloting was ordered, they shifted their focus towards backdated and fraudulent allotments and numbers of such cases surfaced after 2017-18 and many of them were uncovered by current managements itself during the last two years. 
When contacted, CDA’s spokesperson Syed Asif Raza said that some suspicious allotments of I-11 were reported to member estate, who asked security directorate to conduct preliminary probe to ascertain facts. “At this stage, you can’t say it a scam rather we are conducting a fact finding. In case any wrongdoing is proved, then strict action would be taken against guilty officials after completing legal procedure,” he said.

Unveiling the schedule along with commission members Raja Farooq Niaz and Farhat Ali Mir at a press conference, AJK chief election commissioner (CEC) retired Justice Abdul Rashid Sulehria claimed that the date for polling had been fixed after formal consultations with the government.
“We had asked the government to choose any date between Sept 18 and Sept 22 for polling but it wrote back that polling should be held at any date between Sept 25 and Sept 28,” he said.
He declared that elections would be held on party basis and across the state on the same day.
Giving details of the schedule, Mr Mir said that nomination papers could be submitted from Aug 15 to Aug 22, which would be scrutinized by the returning officers on Aug 23.
Appeals against rejection or acceptance of nomination papers could be filed with the tribunal until Aug 25, and the same would simultaneously be heard on Aug 26 and Aug 27, he said.

5,"Two years on, water filtration plants in Hassanabdal still not functional",The four filtration plants were installed with an allocation of Rs2 million each.,"TAXILA: Water filtration plants in Hassanabdal about two years ago could not be made functional yet.
The plants inaugurated by the then special assistant to the prime minister on climate change Malik Amin Aslam in August 2020 with great fanfare proved an eyewash for the residents of the areas as they are yet to get a single drop of water from these plants due to bureaucratic red tape.
The four filtration plants, one at Sakhinagar and the others at a housing colony were installed with an allocation of Rs2 million each and executed through the provincial public health engineering department
Sources said in one of the two plants the contractor had made a 180 feet deep bore but could not reach water. At the time of its inauguration, the contractor had filled the tank of the plant with water through a tanker.
The locals said they had forwarded several requests to the district administration for the fixing of the plant problem but to no avail. A resident of the area, Shahid Khan, said due to absence of clean drinking water, children and women have been suffering from stomach, liver, kidney and other diseases.
Ghulam Zakaria, another resident, said that the filtration plants were in shambles and all the machinery was rusting due to no official care. These have now become a shelter house for dogs, cats and other animals.
Munaza Peerzada, chairperson of a local NGO, said public interest projects had never been a priority of the authorities and officials of the district administration particularly neglected their responsibility of providing clean drinking water to the people.
When contacted, Dr Khurram, the coordinator for Mr Amin Aslam, said at the time of execution of the project it was decided that these plants would be operated by mohalla committees. He said despite passage of two years, these committees failed to operate and run the plants. He said now the operation of these plants has been handed over to the municipal committee and the company which executed the project was imparting training to the nominees for running them.
“A tug of war between the municipal committee and Public Health Department is causing loss worth millions of rupees to the national kitty. Besides, residents of the area are also deprived of clean drinking water,” said Zulfiqar Hayat Khan, president PPP Hassanabdal chapter.
The incharge of the engineering branch of the municipal committee (MC) Zulfiqar Butt said the committee had declined to take charge of the filtration plants due to substandard civil work and faulty machinery installed in them.
When asked subdivisional officer Public Health Department Mohammad Arshad Naz refuted the allegation of the MC official, clarifying that the civil and technical work was carried out as per the work order. He said a five-member committee formed by MC authorities rejected the civil work and refused to take charge. Subsequently, the plants are in the shambles and electricity was also disconnected by Iesco due to nonpayment of bills.
He said that now the Saaf Pani project of the Punjab government has given an indication to take charge of these filtration plants and a team inspected these plants a few days ago and prepared a report. Hopefully, during next few months these plants would be made functional.

8,New EU envoy plays national anthem on trumpet,The EU is one of Pakistan’s largest trading partners.,"ISLAMABAD: The new ambassador of the European Union Dr Riina Kionka assumed her responsibility in Pakistan. Ahead of the 75th Independence Day of the country and as a commemoration for 60 years of EU-Pakistan relations, she played the national anthem on trumpet.
This unique way to mark Aug 14 was shared through a special campaign on social media on Thursday.
According to a press release issued by the EU delegation, the union is committed towards creating a stable, democratic and pluralistic country that respects human rights and benefits from its full economic potential by supporting sustainable and inclusive development for all its citizens. Collaboration between the EU and Pakistan is grounded in the Strategic Engagement Plan (SEP) signed in 2019. 

 





 
Areas of cooperation under the SEP include peace and security, democracy, rule of law, human rights, migration and other sectors such as energy, climate change and science and technology.
The EU is one of Pakistan’s largest trading partners and has supported Pakistan’s integration into the global economy and its sustainable economic development, by granting it preferential access to the European single market under the GSP+ system since 2014. Ambassador Kionka called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who said that Pakistan attached high importance to its relations with EU as well as its historically close and cooperative bilateral ties with EU member states.
Recalling his recent telephone conversations with the EU Council President Charles Michel and president of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, the PM expressed confidence in upcoming visits of EU’s parliamentary delegations as well as the next rounds of political and security dialogues that will take place under EU-Pakistan Strategic Engagement Plan. 
He credited the current GSP Plus scheme with enhancing the mutually beneficial trading ties between Pakistan and EU and hoped that Pakistan would continue to be part of the arrangement beyond 2023.

The new patients were admitted to Holy Family Hospital, Benazir Bhutto Hospital, and District Headquarters Hospital in Raja Bazaar. Three more patients arrived from Islamabad; however, they were not included in the database after the district health authority (DHA) asked officials concerned not to include patients from other districts in the local data.
DHA CEO Dr Anser Ishaq told Dawn that at least 20 suspected dengue patients were admitted to hospitals over the past 24 hours. Out of them, six reports came back positive, he said and added that others’ reports will be finalised today. Dr Ishaq claimed that the situation was normal in the garrison city areas as most patients were arriving from peripheries in hopes of better treatment at the major hospitals located in Pindi. He added that the anti-dengue measures were in full swing but more needed to be done to avoid a repeat of 2019 when more than 4,000 cases were reported during the outbreak of the virus. He added that in light of further rain forecast and increase in the number of patients, the anti-dengue measures such as fogging should remain intact.
It may be noted here that Chak Jalaldin and Kahuta were reported as the hotbed of the virus as out of the total number of patients, at least 21 and 11 cases were reported from these areas, respectively. The figure, however, doesn’t include the number of dengue patients admitted to private medical facilities or the tehsil headquarters hospitals in the six sub-districts of the Pindi district.

10,Activists call for end to forced conversion of minors to Islam,Say govt must work towards making Pakistan inclusive for minorities...,"ISLAMABAD: Activists belonging to religious minorities here on Thursday, demanded an end to forced conversion of girls to Islam, and stressed that those in authority have to follow the guidelines of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah to make the condition of non-Muslims living in Pakistan better.
Chairman of the Minorities Alliance Pakistan Akmal Bhatti while addressing participants of the ‘Jinnah Ka Pakistan Awami Rally, said that incidents of kidnapping, rape and coercion of minor girls have been rapidly increasing in the country.
He said political, social and economic exploitation of religious minorities is contrary to Mr Jinnah’s teachings, adding that the reckless use of sensitive religious laws and extrajudicial killings continues but the state seems to be helpless against such elements.
Speakers demanded electoral reforms as they claim that the present system has introduced a culture of nepotism, bribery and flattery and closed the door to genuine representation of minorities.

Say govt must work towards making Pakistan inclusive for minorities

Under present laws, political parties have been appointing handpicked minority representatives in the assemblies, which is against democracy.
Shamoon Gul, Sardar Ram Singh, Anush Bhatti, Asif Jan, Sadaf Adnan, Khalid Raheel, Samuel Latif, Fayaz Bhatti and others addressed the rally. They said governments have failed to take concrete steps to bring out backward and extremely poor sections of society from economic and educational misery. 
Meanwhile, the National Assembly, while commemorating the Diamond Jubilee of Pakistan, acknowledged achievements by members of religious minorities in Pakistan who played a key role in the progress and prosperity of the country.
In a statement by the NA Secretariat, Article 33 of the Constitution discourages discrimination and parochial, racial, tribal, sectarian and provincial prejudices among citizens.
It adds that the declaration made by Mr Jinnah in his address on Aug 11, 1947 to the first Constituent Assembly was: “You are free. You are free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques or to any other places of worship in this state of Pakistan.”
In another development Hafiz Mohammad Tahir Mehmood Ashrafi, chairman of Pakistan Ulema Council (PUC) said that the rights of religious minorities were being protected at every respective level and committees of PUC and National Solidarity Council were jointly working in this regard in the country.
Speaking at a seminar held under the aegis of Centre for Research and Dialogue, Mr Ashrafi said that the Ulemas-Mashaykh played a very important in maintaining peace and order during the month of Muharram.
He said that rights enshrined in the Constitution of Pakistan for minorities cannot be usurped, adding that Paigham-i-Pakistan has become the identity for stability of Pakistan.
He said no one in the country will be allowed to play with the rights of minorities adding minorities in India were facing the worst situation and not a single Muharram congregation or majlis was allowed in India-held Kashmir during Ashura.
Not only this but around 150 churches were burnt to ashes while more than 200 Christian leaders were killed in India, but lower caste Hindus have to face the worst atrocities, whereas Muslims have almost been deprived of their rights as citizens in India.
