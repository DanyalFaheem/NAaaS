1,KP to revamp tribal district headquarters hospitals on its own,Move comes after centre’s refusal to provide funds; provincial govt has already announced such a programme for settled districts.,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has decided to revamp district headquarters hospitals in tribal districts from its own resources after the suspension of healthcare funding by the federal government at the start of the current financial year.
In the 2022-23 budget, the government had announced the Revamping of Secondary Health Facilities Programme for settled districts at the cost of Rs20 billion in two years, officials told Dawn.
They, however, said the centre’s refusal to continue funding health projects in tribal districts during the current fiscal had forced the province to cover all secondary health initiatives under that programme.
For the Revamping of Secondary Health Facilities Programme, the health department has already selected six hospitals in Peshawar, Charsadda, Haripur, Karak and Abbottabad districts. In the next phase, such health facilities in other districts will be upgraded.

Move comes after centre’s refusal to provide funds; provincial govt has already announced such a programme for settled districts 

The officials said the provincial government had included seven DHQ hospitals in as many tribal districts in the revamping programme after the centre declined to provide funds for them.
They said the federal government had also stopped free health services for the erstwhile Fata and frontier regions in July this year asking the province to include that population in its Sehat Card Plus programme.
The officials said previously, 12 million families in tribal districts received free treatment under the centre-run Sehat Sahulat Programme (SSP) but currently, they availed themselves of the cashless treatment under the provincial government’s Sehat Card Plus programme.
They said the province had asked for Rs5 billion funds for the healthcare of those residents until June 2023.
The officials said besides the construction of new hospitals in the province, the government had announced the revamping of DHQ hospitals in phases.
They, however, said DHQ hospitals in seven tribal districts were also made part of the programme in light of poor healthcare situation.
When contacted, provincial director-general (health services) Dr Shaheen Afridi said the hospital revamping programme would bring much-needed improvement in healthcare system in the province.
“DHQ hospitals in tribal districts have been included in the programme as part of the programme to upgrade services and provide adequate staff, equipments and medical supplies to ensure better secondary care facilities,” she said.
The DG said health facilities in tribal districts were managed by a separate directorate before the Fata-KP merger but they were later brought under the health services directorate, which improved services there.
She said the health department’s independent monitoring unit had begun operation in the region and health facilities were regularly monitored and disciplinary action was taken accordingly.
Dr Shaheen said though the health department initially struggled to merge its ex-Fata employees with those from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 90 per cent of work on it had been completed.
She said health regulations had been implemented in tribal districts with the deployment of drug inspectors to manage medicine-related matters on the pattern of settled districts.
The DG said six to seven DHQ hospitals would be upgraded in every phase and thus, improving patient care with strict monitoring by the health department.
Meanwhile, officials in the health secretariat said health minister Taimur Jhagra had ordered the inclusion of ex-Fata DHQ hospitals in the secondary healthcare revamping programme meant for settled districts.
They said an amount of Rs700 million would be spent on the improvement of infrastructure, equipment and HR in each of the hospitals.
Officials said the government had also decided to outsource health facilities in tribal districts as part of its initiative to contract out 58 health facilities under public-private partnership, which would further improve patient care.
They said health facilities in the province had a heavy patient load from tribal districts due to poor services and absenteeism in hospitals of their region.
The officials said the erstwhile Fata had over 1,100 health centres but as there was no proper check and balance for them, the residents had to go to settled districts, especially Peshawar, for diagnosis and treatment.

Meanwhile, former tehsil nazim and JUI-F leader Malik Ihsan Khan told a presser that all political and legal options would be used for the restoration of old constituencies.

5,High court grants bail to juvenile in assault case,PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has granted bail to a juvenile suspect charged with sexually assaulting a...,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has granted bail to a juvenile suspect charged with sexually assaulting a six-year-old boy in Shangla district two months ago.
Justice Mohammad Naeem Anwar of a single-member bench accepted the suspect’s petition on the condition of furnishing two surety bonds of Rs200,000 each.
The bench observed that according to a certificate issued by the National Database and Registration Authority, the petitioner was born on April 2, 2011, and his age was 11 years and two months when he allegedly committed the crime.
It observed that the offence attracted the prohibitory clause of Section 497 of the Code of Criminal Procedure  but the provisions of the Juvenile Justice System Act, 2018, provided concession to the juvenile accused, especially those under 16 years of age.
It observed that since the petitioner was under 16, he was entitled to the concession of bail.
The court observed that the matter had been patched up by the relevant parties at the intervention of local elders and that affidavits by them along with their joint statement recorded by a lower court were also produced.
It added that the father of the assault victim, who was present in the courtroom, had no objection to the release of the petitioner on bail.
The court observed that although the offence was not compoundable, a compromise was prima facie in the best interest of both parties.
The FIR against the petitioner was registered at the Bisham police station in Shangla district on June 18, 2022, under Section 377 of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 52 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection and Welfare Act.
The complainant in the case was the assault victim’s grandfather, who alleged that his grandson had stepped out of his house to play with friends but the suspect took him to nearby fields and sexually assaulted him.
The petitioner’s counsel contended that his client had been suffering from multiple diseases inside the prison and recently underwent appendix surgery.
He contended that the matter had already been patched up between the party and the complainant and father of the assault victim had given affidavits that they had no objection if the petitioner was freed on bail.
The lawyer said Form B of the petitioner clearly proved that he was a juvenile and under the Juvenile Justice System Act he was entitled to the concession of bail. He argued that at the tender age, the petitioner was not capable of committing that heinous offence.
