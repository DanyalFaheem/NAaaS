• Letter of comfort for PSO to raise Rs50bn loan
ISLAMABAD: In view of cheaper imports than local production, the government on Thursday increased by almost 25 per cent the Dealer Transfer Price (DTP) of imported urea to Rs2,150 per bag to ensure uniformity with locally manufactured fertiliser.
The decision was taken at a meeting of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet which also approved a $142 million government guarantee for Roosevelt Hotel in New York and Rs50bn to Pakistan State Oil to honour Rs110bn worth of local and international liabilities. Finance Minister Miftah Ismail presided over the meeting.
Revision in imported urea price 
The Ministry of Industry and Production (MoIP) informed the ECC that DTP for imported urea was fixed at Rs1,718 per 50kg bag, exclusive of Rs50 dealer margin, in February this year. However, the retail urea price increased to Rs1,950 per bag including a dealer margin of Rs145.
Since the price of imported urea stored in National Fertiliser Marketing Ltd (NFML) warehouses is lower than locally manufactured urea, the ECC on the proposal of MoIP decided to remove the disparity in prices by increasing DTP for imported fertiliser to Rs1,805 per bag by NFML (exclusive of Rs145 per bag dealer margin for stocks sold between June 23 and July 25 this year).
Further, the ECC also decided that the DTP of remaining stocks held by NFML further increased to Rs2,150 per bag (exclusive of dealer margin) with effect from July 26 onwards. The ECC further directed that the urea pricing and dealer margin be fixed in the future with prior approval of the ECC, instead of seeking ex-post facto approvals as fait accompli. The DTP revision would result in an increased recovery of Rs117 million to NFML on the remaining stocks.
The meeting was informed that local manufacturers had on June 28 this year increased retail prices of urea to Rs2,150 from Rs1,805. Over time, NFML had booked imported urea at Rs1,805 per bag and shipped 83,295 tonnes, leaving a balance of about 16,904 tonnes with NFML stocks till June 25.
Loan facility to PSO 
The Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division) presented a summary on the syndicated running finance facility for PSO and recalled that ECC had allowed a Rs30bn supplementary grant for foreign exchange losses besides payment of Rs32.8bn by the power sector in two installments by Aug 4 and Rs50bn government guaranteed loan. This arrangement was meant to ensure that PSO met its Rs110bn local and international liabilities during Aug 10–20 period.
The Petroleum Division reported that Habib Bank Ltd as the lead of the consortium — Allied Bank, National Bank of Pakistan, MCB Bank and United Bank — had arranged Rs50bn to PSO but conditioned it to a government guarantee as the banks had already stretched their SBP-imposed credit limits to PSO and hence could no longer fund PSO without GOP guarantee.
As the issuance of a guarantee will take time, the banks agreed to initiate the process of issuing a loan on the letter of comfort (LoC) from the Ministry of Finance. The petroleum division claimed that without the federal government’s LoC, the PSO would not be able to fulfill its payment obligations.
Therefore, the ECC approved the issuance of a letter of comfort in favour of PSO for raising a loan facility of Rs50 billion on an urgent basis. However, the ECC also decided that Finance Division would divert some other allocated guarantees to PSO without exceeding the Rs105bn domestic guarantee limit for the first quarter of the current fiscal year under the IMF programme.
Guarantee to Roosevelt Hotel 
The ECC also approved GOP guarantee for a financing facility of $142m as a loan under the facility agreement signed between Roosevelt Hotel Corporation (RHC) and the National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) under a previous ECC decision of September 2020.
The September 2020 ECC decision required issuance of a GOP guarantee for $142m loan but was put on hold on the advice of the Attorney General of Pakistan given litigation with Tethyan Copper Company in Reko Diq case in British Virgin Islands court, where PIA-Investment Ltd is registered. Now that the two sides have signed a standstill agreement for suspension of litigation on Reko Diq till December this year, the ECC approved a $142m GOP guarantee.
Roosevelt Hotel Corporation (RHC), owned by PIA-IL, was shut down in December 2020 as the hotel business slowed down in the USA and around the world due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
OMC’s margin 
The petroleum division did not seek approval of about a 63pc increase in margin to oil marketing companies on the sale of petroleum products to Rs6 per liter instead of Rs3.68 per liter. The matter was on the agenda but it was decided to take up the matter in a subsequent meeting of the ECC.

1,Govt mulls Rs15bn new taxes ahead of IMF meeting,The withdrawal of tax on retailers will now be collected from other taxpayers to make up for the loss.,"ISLAMABAD: The government has decided to introduce new taxation measures worth Rs15 billion in the next few days as part of the agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to revive a loan programme.
The new measures are expected to be taken ahead of the IMF board meeting scheduled for Aug 24, which among others will approve the release of a $1.17 billion tranche for Pakistan as part of the extended fund facility (EFF).
An official source told Dawn that tax authorities have held out an assurance to the Fund to collect Rs42bn from fixed taxation of shopkeepers. The withdrawal of tax on retailers will now be collected from other taxpayers to make up for the loss.
“We have conveyed to the IMF that the tax from traders will now be around Rs27bn as announced in the budget,’ the official source said, adding that the tax authorities have proposed several areas for either increasing tax rates or imposing a fresh tax to make up the loss.
He said the government has held out an assurance to the Fund that no revenue will be compromised as agreed ahead of the staff level agreement. Pakistan and IMF have already reached the staff level agreement last month.
One of the sectors, which will be further taxed is ‘tobacco and cigarettes. “We have proposed to further increase tax rates on cigarettes”, the source said, adding this is one of the potential areas for collecting taxes from it.
The official said there was no proposal on the table to change the tax structure in the fertiliser sector. “As of today, there is no such move or proposal of tax fertiliser,” a tax official in the FBR told Dawn. The government in the budget has exempted tax on the fertiliser to benefit the agriculture sector.
IMF Resident Representative in Pakistan Esther Perez Ruiz in a statement on Aug 2 said that an increase in petroleum development levy on July 31 was Pakistan’s last prior action for the 7th and 8th reviews. The IMF board meeting is planned for late August once adequate financing assurances are confirmed, she said.

2,"Textile exports to dip by $3bn due to govt policies, warns Aptma","“It’d be a miracle if we’re able to retain our exports at the current level,” Aptma secretary general says.","KARACHI: The All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (Aptma) believes export proceeds of the textile sector will go down by up to $3 billion in the current fiscal year because of the government’s policies that have “strangulated” the largest dollar-earning sector of the economy.
“I can’t see (us) getting out of this perfect storm… It’d be a miracle if we’re able to retain our exports at the current level,” said Aptma Secretary General Shahid Sattar while speaking at a seminar organised by the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics on Thursday.
Textile exports increased almost 26 per cent to $19.3bn in 2021-22, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics.
Mr Sattar said the textile sector performed “pretty well” in the last two years as its foreign earnings increased by roughly $7bn. However, he said he’s become a “big sceptic” with regard to the immediate future of the textile sector given the severity of its working capital crisis.
The national currency has lost more than two-thirds of its value of late, which means the pre-existing limits on textile mills’ working capital have become redundant. “Exporters are facing huge issues in financing the export cycle, which lasts four to six months. You need double the amount of currency now to finance that cycle,” he said while criticising the sales tax that’s meant for domestic sales but results in mopping up liquidity from the export-oriented segment of the textile sector.
“You collect Rs300-350bn a year and retain up to Rs60bn (and refund the rest). This has soaked up liquidity… the Export Finance Scheme just doesn’t cover the lack of working capital. How can our exports grow if we don’t have working capital?” he said.
He criticised the government for failing to supply gas and electricity to the textile units that have recently been either upgraded or built anew using the subsidised loans under the Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF).
“We invested heavily through TERF in new plants and machinery and upgradation… But they’ve not been given the energy that they need to operate on. All these people who expanded their operations are now in fact cursing me, saying the expansion isn’t being utilised. Who will service these debts?”

3,"KE users to pay extra Rs9.9 per unit in Aug, Rs8 in Sept",ISLAMABAD: The power regulator has allowed K-Electric to charge an unprecedented Rs11.10 per unit as additional fuel...,"ISLAMABAD: The power regulator has allowed K-Electric to charge an unprecedented Rs11.10 per unit as additional fuel cost adjustment (FCA) — or Rs21.7 billion in total — from users on account of the electricity they consumed in June. 
However, in its notification issued on Thursday, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) directed the Karachi-based power utility to ensure the FCA is charged in two instalments — Rs9.90 per unit in August and Rs8.09 in September.
This was done to stagger a massive impact of about Rs18 per unit on consumers in one month, given an outstanding backlog of about Rs6.89 per unit for May consumption when, too, the regulator had divided April’s FCA in two parts to ensure a uniform fuel cost adjustment of about Rs7.90 per unit across the country.
The regulator ordered that out of Rs11.10 additional FCA for June, Rs3.0114 per unit shall be charged in the billing month of August and the remaining, i.e. Rs8.09 per unit, shall be charged for September.
In addition, the KE was also directed to charge Rs6.89 per unit for the FCA of May in August.
The utility’s consumers would effectively pay Rs9.90 per unit FCA in August and Rs8.09 per unit in September on top of future FCA that has to accrue for electricity consumption in July.
The regulator has already cleared Rs9.90 per unit FCA to be recovered from consumers of other distribution companies in August with a financial impact of Rs132bn.
Nepra said it realised that a massive FCA burden was unbearable to consumers. “Burdening the consumer with FCA of June, i.e. Rs11.10 per kWh, in August would not be in the interest of the consumers,” it said. “The authority has further noted that in the matter of XWDISCOs [power distribution companies previously managed by Wapda], the authority has allowed Rs9.8972 per kWh as FCA for the month of June to be recovered in the month of August.”
Therefore, the regulator has “decided to charge Rs3.0114 per kWh for the FCA of June in the billing month of August and the remaining (Rs8.0909 per kWh) shall be charged in the billing month of September,” it added.

SBP reserves down $555m
Meanwhile, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said on Thursday its reserves in the week ending on Aug 5 decreased by $555 million to $7.83bn owing to external debt payments. “Debt repayments are expected to moderate during the next three weeks of this month. In fact, around three-fourths of debt servicing for the month of August was concentrated during the first week,” it added.
Net foreign reserves held by commercial banks amounted to $5.73bn. Therefore, total liquid foreign reserves clocked in at $13.56bn, the SBP said.

5,Traders seek clarity on removal of fixed sales tax,Say some had paid bill in June even though tax collection through electricity bills was targeted to be collected from July.,"KARACHI: Leaders representing traders and retailers have said the delay in issuance of notification for the removal of fixed sales tax of Rs6,000 in electricity bills is creating a lot of problems for small businesses. 
They said some traders fearing power disconnection had paid the bill in June even though the sales tax collection through electricity bills was targeted to be collected from July.
Many traders had not paid the bill at the request of trade bodies which showed strong resistance towards the imposition of fixed sales tax in power bills forcing the government to withdraw it.
Markeze Anjuman-e-Tajiran Pakistan President Kashif Chaudhry told Dawn from Lahore on Thursday that the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) on Aug 5 issued minutes of Aug 4 meeting presided over by Finance Minister Miftah Ismail in which various decisions regarding sales tax collection through electricity bills were taken.
He was of the view that the decisions included in the minutes of the meeting were enough instead of issuing any notification or any SRO.
However, he urged the government to issue instructions or any circular to the banks to accept the power bills without the sales tax and also delete the late surcharge fees as 70-80pc traders have not paid their bills due to countrywide protest.
The meeting decided that the fixed tax scheme introduced through Finance Act 2022 would be rolled back ab initio and the retailers would continue to pay taxes as per the previous mechanism and rates.
The previous tax rates would continue to apply to retailers from July 1 to September. The government would review the situation and would notify new tax rates effective from Oct 1. For reversal of the fixed tax scheme, necessary legislation would be enacted by the FBR as soon as possible, the minutes said.
All City Tajir Itehaad Association General Secretary M. Ahmed Shamsi said the finance minister on Aug 5 announced the removal of the Rs6,000 sales tax and assured the trade bodies that he would call upon KE head of billing in Karachi on Aug 6 to issue new bills without sales tax besides extending the due date by eight to 10 days.
Supreme Council of Traders chief Imran Baghpati asked the government to evolve a mechanism to refund Rs6,000 sales tax to all those who had paid their June bills.

7,Oil demand rises as gas prices surge: IEA,"Raises its demand growth forecast by 380,000 barrels per day.","PARIS: Global oil demand will rise more than previously forecast this year as heatwaves and soaring gas prices are prompting countries to switch fuels for power generation, the International Energy Agency said on Thursday.
Oil prices have dropped by $30 per barrel from a peak in June due to growing supplies and  “escalating concerns over the deteriorating economic outlook”, the Paris-based agency said in a monthly report.
Meanwhile, prices of natural gas and electricity have jumped to new records, prompting some countries to switch to oil use, the IEA said.
“With several regions experiencing blazing heatwaves, the latest data confirm increased oil burn in power generation, especially in Europe and the Middle East but also across Asia,” the agency said.
“Fuel switching is also taking place in European industry, including refining,” said the IEA, which advises developed countries on energy policy.
Consequently, the IEA raised its demand growth forecast by 380,000 barrels per day.
Demand is now seen rising by 2.1 million bpd to a total of 99.7 million bpd in 2022. It will reach 101.8 million bpd in 2023, exceeding pre-Covid levels.
