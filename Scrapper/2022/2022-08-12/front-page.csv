•   Manufacturers say rising raw material costs rendering most drugs unfeasible to produce
• Drap claims pharma sector gunning for across-the-board price rise
KARACHI: A tug of war between pharmaceutical manufacturers and the drug regulatory body is threatening to turn into a crisis after a decision by local companies to stop the production of several drugs has led to shortages of medicines in the market.
A list of around 40 different medicines, compiled by health professionals from leading public and private sector hospitals, seen by Dawn, indicates that several locally manufactured tablets, syrups, injections and ointments or drops are no longer available. 
A senior pharmacist who was part of the team that compiled the list for the authorities in July told Dawn that these medicines include prescriptions for several conditions.
For example, all the brands of Lithium Carbonate — used to treat mental health issues and often referred to as ‘suicide prevention drugs’ — are not available in the market.
In addition, essential medicines, including methylphenidate for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and clonazepam drops and tablets for epilepsy in children and adults, have not been available for the past several weeks.

“It doesn’t end here. Medicines for patients of tuberculosis, epilepsy, Parkinson’s, cardiovascular disease and other conditions are also not available in the market… but I don’t know why this situation has failed to create any buzz,” he said.
Health professionals have already started experiencing the impact of this crisis and are seeking immediate intervention from the authorities. The situation is so grim that some healthcare professionals Dawn spoke to said that the number of products on the list was increasing with each passing day.
The issue behind the shortage stems from producers who have been complaining about rising prices of raw material in the international market, resulting in an elevated production cost, which they insist can only be met through a 40 per cent increase in prices across the board.
“Right now, several medicines are not available in the local market because their cost of production has increased several fold and it has become infeasible for manufacturers to produce these drugs,” said Qazi Mansoor Dilawar of the Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers’ Association (PPMA).
This demand, however, is facing resistance from the government, which sounded the alarm on the growing shortage of medicines last month when a task force was set up by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to look into the crisis.
The task force met leaders of the pharmaceutical industry, who forwarded their proposals for increasing the prices of medicines, citing growing costs of production.
However, even as the task force works to complete its mandate, citizens are facing a serious shortage of drug supplies.
The pharmaceutical industry claims that local manufacturers have stopped importing raw materials owing to their rising prices in the international market. In the face of government refusals to allow them to raise prices, they claim that manufacturing the drugs has become “infeasible” for them.
The fresh import numbers suggest a sharp decline in the amount of raw materials purchased by local pharmaceutical companies, mainly from China, for the production of essential and critical medicines. Importers and their vendors refer to some “200 molecules” that are no longer being imported due to their higher prices in the international market.
According to PPMA’s Mr Dilawar, the emerged after international trade was opened following the lifting of pandemic restrictions. At the time, he said, the prices of raw material increased at a staggering rate, something which was not helped by the recent appreciation of the US dollar.
This had forced several producers to review their business plans, he said, adding that it the situation persisted, more than 200 generics would no longer be available in the market.

An importer Dawn spoke to said: “This is the third week that no new order has been placed. Current production is all based on existing stock of raw material that was available to some producers, but this will not last long. Sooner or later, production will definitely grind to a halt.”
The authorities, however, term the industry reaction “somewhat exaggerated”, saying that it appears to be a bid to obtain approval for an across-the-board increase in the prices of medicines. 
Although no one from the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) was available to speak on the record, an official from the regulator told Dawn on condition of anonymity that the shortage was not as dire as was being portrayed. 
“There’s a shortage of some medicines but it’s not as huge as is being claimed,” he said.
“This appears to be a move to obtain approval for the proposed increase in prices of all medicines, which is not possible. There were some supply chain issues for more than half a dozen drugs, which are not available in the market. There are some genuine issues and some 35 medicines have been identified so far [for price increase]. We have moved the case of these 35 with a proposal to review their prices.”

1,"PTI admits to Shahbaz Gill’s ‘blunder’, stops short of ‘condemnation’","Fawad Chaudhry says his colleague could have chosen his words better, Shah Mahmood Qureshi regrets statement.","ISLAMABAD: While the senior leadership of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) stopped short of condemning outright the controversial statement made by Dr Shahbaz Gill on a TV channel on Aug 8, the party has conceded that he could have chosen better words, or not said what he did.
Addressing a press conference on Thursday, PTI Senior Vice President Fawad Chaudhry refused to condemn Gill’s statement, instead suggested his colleague could have had a better choice of words. 
“I would have condemned the statement if he wasn’t under arrest. Now, after his arrest, condemning the statement does not seem appropriate to me. Moreover, efforts are being made to drive a wedge between Imran Khan and the army. Mr Khan has always worked for the prosperity of the country and that is what the army does too,” he said while addressing reporters.
He claimed the “cabal of crooks” was making all-out efforts to create discord between the PTI and the army, but they would not succeed in their nefarious designs, as the PTI chief wanted a strong army.

Fawad says his colleague could have chosen his words better, Qureshi regrets statement

On Tuesday afternoon, the PTI chairman’s Chief of Staff, Dr Gill, was arrested for allegedly making ‘hateful remarks’ against the army in a TV programme on Aug 8, and charged under several sections of the PPC, including those related to sedition and abetting mutiny.
When Mr Chaudhry was asked during the press conference why the PTI leadership appeared to have distanced itself from Gill and not approached him in prison, he denied the impression that the party had left its leader alone. “Gill was produced in court at 8am and his lawyer was already in the court. Police has been shifting Gill after every four to six hours, so we don’t know where he is being lodged. If any of you is aware of his whereabouts, tell me and I’ll go meet him,” he said while speaking to the reporters.
He also condemned the alleged police action against Gill’s driver and his wife who was picked up from her house.
PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi also admitted that Gill should have been careful and, in retrospect, not said what he did.
Speaking to DawnNews on Wednesday, however, he maintained that the way his colleague was arrested was not appropriate. “Due legal process should have been followed in Gill’s arrest. He should have been issued a notice, summoned and an explanation sought from him. The PTI respects institutions and has never ridiculed them or tried to create divisions within them,” he remarked.  
Moreover, a senior PTI office-bearer, requesting anonymity, said although Mr Gill had crossed the red line, it was a unanimous understanding at the leadership level that his statement should not be condemned.
“Condemning the statement of Mr Gill will discourage other party leaders and they may go on the back foot while defending party policies,” he said.
However, PTI Islamabad president Ali Awan, while talking to Dawn, categorically said Gill had expressed his personal opinion and the party respected that.
“Every party has hardliners and soft-spoken people, such as Nawaz and Shehbaz Sharif, who have different stances on the same issue. Similarly, Khawaja Asif and other PML-N leaders use different tones on the same issues,” he added.
While replying to a question, Mr Awan denied the reports that his outspoken party fellow was given a written statement to read, saying it was purely his own opinion.
“Moreover, Mr Gill, in the court, stated he did not mean what the media has been trying to portray. So once things are cleared, the party may discuss condemnation of the statement, but at the moment, there is no such plan. The party will firmly stand by Mr Gill,” he asserted.
At his press conference here, Fawad Chaudhry also accused the coalition government of plunging the country into a host of problems, allegedly destroying Pakistan economically and politically.
He further took on the Sharif family for their alleged corruption, claiming the government had adopted a policy of intimidation and coercion and controlled media houses, believing they would manage things, but this would not yield any result.

2,"Court stops action against ex-speaker, Suri ‘ignores’ FIA notice",PHC seeks comments from FIA on Qaiser's plea against probe into two of PTI's bank accounts in Peshawar.,"ISLAMABAD: Further seeking reprieve from courts in the prohibited funding case, a Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) staffer challenged the call-up notice issued to him by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) in its ongoing probe into the case, while the Peshawar High Court restrained the FIA from taking any action against former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser.
Muhammad Nauman Afzal, deputy director of the Party Management Cell, was among the four PTI officials authorised to receive funds from Pakistan and abroad. Others included telephone operator Tahir Iqbal, accountant Muhammad Arshad and office helper Muhammad Rafiq, as per the Election Commission of Pakistan’s findings.
According to Akbar S Babar, the estranged PTI leader and complainant in the prohibited funding case, Rs11.104 million had been deposited in the accounts of the four employees, which was beyond their known sources of income.
Afzal contended in the petition that “opening and maintaining of those accounts had never been disputed by the complainant...Those accounts were (admittedly) never used for any funding of an enlisted political party and no such finding was recorded by the Election Commission”.
He further contended that the ECP had not directed the FIA to inquire into any aspect of these accounts. These matters exclusively fell within the jurisdiction of the ECP, and not of the FIA, he maintained. The petition requested the court to set aside the FIA’s call-up notice for being issued without any legal backing.
PHC order on Qaiser’s plea
Meanwhile, the Peshawar High Court stopped the FIA from taking any adverse action against Mr Qaiser and sought comments from the agency over his plea against the initiation of an inquiry into two bank accounts of the PTI in Peshawar.
A bench comprising Justice Shakeel Ahmad and Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel ordered the comments be filed within a fortnight and also include the documents showing the matter had been referred by the ECP to the federal government for taking legal action against the petitioner.
The bench directed the court’s office to fix for hearing in the last week of August the petition that requested the court to set aside a notice issued by the FIA to Qaiser to appear before an inquiry officer in connection with the probe into two bank accounts managed by the former speaker from 2018 till 2013 as the PTI provincial head. The petitioner wants the inquiry to be declared illegal and based on mala fide.
The petitioner also sought interim relief from the court, requesting it to suspend action on the inquiry and stop the respondents, including the relevant FIA officials, from issuing ‘adverse’ orders against him until the disposal of the case.
The bench directed an additional attorney general to submit comments on behalf of the two respondents -- the FIA deputy director and the inquiry officer.
Suri doesn’t show up
On the other hand, former National Assembly deputy speaker Qasim Khan Suri, former Balochistan governor Syed Zahoor Ahmed Agha and local party leaders Dawood Panizai and Abdul Wahab Agha did not appear before the FIA to submit their replies in the prohibited funding case probe.
The FIA had issued notices to the leaders for appearing at its Quetta office for answering questions about the party’s funds, and sought the record of funds transferred to PTI’s Balochistan accounts between 2011 and 2013.
“None of the PTI leaders, who were summoned for appearing in FIA Quetta banking circle for investigation today, showed up,” FIA Banking Circle Deputy Director Muhammad Ali Abro told Dawn, adding all four leaders would be issued notices again.
However, Mr Suri said the FIA notice was received at his Quetta residence on Wednesday night. “I was not in Quetta and there was no flight today (Thursday) for the city, which is why I could not appear before the FIA,” he claimed.
He said the money sent to Balochistan from 2011 to 2013 in the official PTI account through banks was spent on the party secretariat’s expenditures.
Meanwhile, PTI Balochistan spokesman Asif Tareen claimed none of the PTI leaders appeared before the FIA in Quetta as the notices issued to them were illegal. He said according to Qasim Suri, the Islamabad High Court had declared the FIA’s notices “unconstitutional”.
Waseem Ahmad Shah in Peshawar and Saleem Shahid in Quetta also contributed to this report.

3,Punjab govt sacks 25 SHOs to ‘avenge’ treatment of PTI marchers,Official sources indicate that axe will fall not only on civil and police bureaucrats but also some politicians of PML-N.,"LAHORE: Gearing up for a major action against those involved in the torture of PTI’s leaders and workers on May 25, the Lahore police on Thursday shown the door to 25 station house officers (SHOs) for their alleged involvement in the “sordid” episode during the party’s Azadi March at the “behest of the Hamza Shehbaz administration”.
Official sources indicate that axe will fall not only on civil and police bureaucrats but also some politicians of PML-N. The PTI-PML-Q Punjab government may give a surprise to PML-N by arresting some of its top leaders like former chief minister Hamza Shehbaz, federal Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah and Special Assistant to PM Ata Tarar.   
“Lahore police have suspended 25 SHOs from service and initiated inquiry against them,” Punjab Home Minister retired Col Muhammad Hashim said in a tweet.

 





 
He quoted Chief Minister Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi as having directed him to take action against people involved in breaking the law on behalf of their master in May. “I will not leave anyone and will take action against [them] all,” he said.

 





 
DIG Operation Afzaal Ahmed Kouser claimed to have “conducted interviews and removed SHOs from their posts while he also appointed 32 new SHOs” to different police stations in the city.
However, he claimed to have removed old SHOs and issued posting orders for new SHOs by taking administrative measures. 
Repeated attempts to obtain his comment failed.
It may be noted that SHOs in Lahore played a key role in crackdown against PTI leaders and activists ahead of and during the party’s Azadi March on Islamabad.
Earlier on Aug 1, the Punjab government removed two top police officials for their role in torture of the participants of Azadi March.
The government removed DIG Operations retired Capt Sohail Chaudhry and directed him to report to the Services and General Administration Department. AIG Special Branch Usman Anwar was also removed and his services were handed over to the Centre.
Previously, the Punjab government had withdrawn all cases filed against PTI leaders during Azadi March when PML-N ruled the province and decided to take action against policemen involved in torturing the participants.
It may be recalled that PTI chairman Imran Khan had formed an anti-victimisation committee under the chairmanship of Shafqat Mahmood. The committee at a meeting reviewed all the cases and decided to collect data of policemen and officials who were posted on May 25.
The committee decided to take action against the cops who acted beyond their duty and called upon the Punjab government to withdraw the cases registered to victimise the party leaders besides also withdrawing orders to arrest the PTI leaders.

4,Met Office warns of another heavy rain spell,"GLOF inundates houses, leaves 12 families homeless in GB's Nagar; downpour in Quetta causes flooding in low-lying areas.","• Senate committee told provinces lack capacity to deal with climate change
• GLOF inundates houses, leaves 12 families homeless in Nagar
• Downpour in Quetta causes flooding in low-lying areas 
ISLAMABAD / QUETTA / GILGIT: The Pakistan Meteorological Depart­ment (PMD) on Thursday said that monsoon season has not yet subsided and a fresh spell of heavy rain would hit the country in August. 
According to the forecast, heavy rain is expected in most parts of Balo­chistan, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, south Punjab, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, APP reported. 
Heavy rain might generate urban flooding in Karachi, Thatta, Badin, Hyderabad, Dadu, Jamshoro, Sukkur, Larkana, Shaheed Benazirabad and Mirpurkhas from Aug 11 to 13, the warning added.

“Flash flooding is expected in Qila Saifullah, Loralai, Barkhan, Kohlu, Mosakhel, Sherani, Sibbi, Bolan, Kalat, Khuzdar, Lasbella, Awaran, Turbat, Panjgur, Pasni, Jiwani, Kohat, Swabi, Nowshera, Mardan, Peshawar, Karak, Bannu, Tank and Waziristan.”
Hot and humid weather is expected in most Punjab districts. However, rain is expected in Bhakkar, Layyah, Sahiwal, Bahawalnagar, Bahawalpur, Dera Ghazi Khan, Multan and Rahim Yar Khan. 
Rain­fall may trigger landslides in Kashmir, KP and GB, warned the PMD.
Separately, the Met department in a meeting of the Senate’s Standing Commi­ttee on Climate Change, cautioned that the entire country will receive above normal rainfall this season.
The committee which met with Senator Seemi Ezdi in the chair at Parlia­ment Lodges, was also briefed by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) chairman on threat of flash floods and urban flooding.  
Minister for Climate Change Sherry Rehman said these events would become a regular feature and the country’s overall infrastructure was not ready for such disasters, which would lead to a severe humanitarian crisis. 
The minister added that despite clear warnings from the Met department, provincial governments lacked the capacity for relief and rescue. 
However, Ministry for Climate Change secretary Asif Hyder Shah also argued that the Met department couldn’t predict weather pattern in certain areas “due to lack of modern equipment”. 
The committee unanimously agreed that a National Action Plan was needed and legislation should be formulated to prepare for the effects of climate change. 
The NDMA chairman told the committee that the Authority has undertaken 11, 639 rescue activities, while 78 relief camps were set up accommodating 23, 061 people affected by floods. 
The committee was told that since June, 575 deaths — 176 in Balochistan, 127 in Sindh and 119 Punjab — had occurred in rain-related accidents, while 939 people were injured. 
GLOF causes flooding in Nagar 
A glacial lake outburst flooding (GLOF) resulted in a disaster in Hoper nullah in Gilgit Baltistan’s Nagar district, leaving many people homeless. Flood water entered homes and damaged several acres of crops while several trees and a bridge were swept away by gushing water. Abid Hussain, a resident of Shaman area told Dawn that flooding in Hoper nullah has damaged many homes, leaving at least 12 families homeless.

It has also damaged cultivated crops which were the only source of income for the locals, he added. 
Another resident Muhammad Hussein told Dawn that flooding in Hoper nullah has damaged every irrigation and water channel in the valley. 
Thousands of local, who depended on water from the nullah for irrigation and drinking, were now facing water shortage, he added. 
Fearing heavy flooding in downstream areas, locals said safety was their biggest concern and criticised the government and NGOs for ignoring the area. 
Yaqoob Ali, a social worker said many organisations like GLOF project spend money on mitigating the impact of melting glaciers, but no organisation has yet responded to the suffering of people in the valley. 
Nagar Deputy Commissioner Zaid Ahmed told Dawn that more than ten families in Shaman Village have been moved to tents, while machinery and relief items have been sent to the area. 
He added that the local administration was monitoring the situation, and efforts were underway to protect lives and properties of people in downstream areas. 
Mr Ahmed said that the work to restore irrigation channels and communication systems was underway. 
The damage assessment will start once the water level in the nullah began subsiding, he added. 
More rains in Balochistan 
A renewed spell of monsoon rains lashed parts of northern, central and southern Balochistan on Thursday. 
Officials said that intermittent rain continued throughout the day in Chaman, Qila Saifullah, Qila Abdullah, Pishin, Ziarat, Harnai, Loralai, Barkhan, Zhob, Sibi, Nasirabad, Noshki, Toba Achakzai, Mastung, Kalat, Khuzdar, Surab, Bolan, Sanjavi, Makhtar and Lasbela districts. 
Quetta also received heavy downpour in the afternoon for two hours with strong winds, resulting in a flood-like situation in low lying areas. The roads were submerged, while rainwater entered homes in these areas.
Editorial: PM’s concern, anguish and promises seem too little too late for flood-hit Balochistan 
Rescue officials and teams from Quetta Metropolitan Corporation immediately started rescue operations in these areas. 
Although some mud houses were damaged, no loss of life was reported in the provincial capital, official sources told Dawn. 
The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has already issued a flood warning in nullahs and seasonal rivers after another spell of torrential rains was forecast by the Met department. 
District administrations have been asked to shift people from areas close to nullahs and rivers.
