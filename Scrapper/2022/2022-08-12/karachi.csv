The disease burden would increase if timely action was not taken, they warned. 
“Yes, the number of diarrhea patients has increased during the monsoon. Many cases appear like cholera, but actually they are not and the patient gets better within three to four days with oral rehydration therapy and use of ispaghol,” medical superintendent of Dow Hospital Dr Zahid Azam said, adding that adults were being affected more than children. 
According to him, patients go to a tertiary care hospital only when the disease gets serious. Hence, the number of unreported cases must be higher than what is being reported at tertiary care hospital as most patients with this illness turn to a general physician practicing in their neighborhood.  
Dr Azam, also a gastroenterologist, blamed filthy civic conditions and consumption of stale/contaminated food for the spread of diarrhoeal diseases. 
According to experts, citizens must take care of hygiene especially hand-hygiene for disease prevention, avoid consumption of food outside home and use boiled water. 
Sharing similar opinion, Dr Abdul Ghafoor Shoro, a senior general physician, said elderly citizens were being affected more with diarrhoeal diseases, most of them with loose stool, stomach cramps, fever and vomiting at his clinic.

The martyr was pilot of the helicopter which met an accident in Lasbela while flying over flood-affected areas in Balochistan and embraced martyrdom along with other army officials.
He condemned the elements which were running campaigns against the institutions on social media. Later, he placed wreath on the martyr’s grave. 
Durrani said that Major Saeed had laid down his life while serving the nation and safeguarding the country’s frontiers.  
He asked the martyr’s family to write to him about the village’s problems and he would convey them to the party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Asif Ali Zardari, Ms Faryal Talpur and Sindh chief minister to get the issues resolved on a priority basis.
He told journalists that the village life had a great role in the training of Major Tunio who had decided to join the army and was ready to embrace martyrdom. “We are proud of him,” he said. 
He said the village’s backwardness called for undertaking development in education, road network and other basic facilities. “I shall try my best to focus on developing the village and the area and with the help of Sindh government’s village uplift program,” he said. 
He recalled tremendous sacrifices the country’s institutions and saluted those who were safeguarding the country’s frontiers at the cost of their lives.

3,Wapda CBA tells govt to switch over to coal-based power generation,LARKANA: The All Pakistan Wapda Hydro Electric Workers Union has advised government to exploit the country’s had...,"LARKANA: The All Pakistan Wapda Hydro Electric Workers Union has advised government to exploit the country’s had huge coal reserves and switch over to highly inexpensive coal-based electricity generation. 
The union’s central president Abdul Latif Nizamani said at a press conference at the Larkana Press Club on Thursday that unfortunately, instead of relying on the vast coal blocks the country was importing coal from Australia and was planning to buy more coal from Afghanistan. What was the rationale behind neglecting indigenous resources of power generation, he asked.
He said that loadshedding was a curse which was affecting the entire country and expressed surprise that the government was buying costly electricity from private power producers at the cost of shutting down its own powerhouses in what was like putting the cart before the horse. The current electricity demand stood at 28,000 megawatt while the country generated 22,000 megawatt, therefore, shortage was natural, he said.
He pointed out 40 per cent shortage of labour in Sukkur Electric Supply Company (Sepco) which was seriously affecting its performance as the available staff had to shoulder burden of understaffing.
He criticised the government’s practice of collecting a variety of taxes unrelated to Wapda through electricity bills and said it was directing consumers’ anger to the institution and tarnishing its image. 
The consumers’ anger over prolonged power outages was getting multiplied by recovery of taxes through power bills and earning bad name for the electricity companies, he said. 
The union was contemplating to oppose the trend of ‘recovering’ multiple other taxes through energy bills. Why not the department concerned was entrusted the task to evolve a methodology of collecting taxes independently, he asked.
Nizamani said that on the one hand the present government had imposed ban on recruitment in Wapda while there were reports that in future all recruitment would be made purely on the basis of fixed pay. If it happened, the workers would not be able to survive on meager pays, he said. 
With this approach, he said, the government would snatch away facility of social security from labourers and termed it violation of human rights. 
He said that fluctuating policies for power sector had sent a wave of unrest through workers. The reports about handing over Sepco and Hesco to Sindh government were highly disturbing for employees, he said. 
About global trends in privatisation of power companies the union leaders Iqbal Khan and Nisar Shaikh said that the strategy had backfired in the shape of upward trend in unemployment and nose-diving performance. 
They said that the union’s struggle was linked with world organisations and “we are constantly watching, observing and analyzing the performance and operations of electricity sector the world over”.
They urged the government to establish a 500 KV grid station in Larkana and immediately upgrade existing grid stations. 
Pointing out lacunas in the constitution of board of directors of power companies, they said the boards lacked representation from rural areas while the one who headed the board belonged to Karachi. 
They opined that exiting skeleton of power distribution in Larkana had become old and required revamping the infrastructure. 
Later, the union leaders visited Sujawal Tunio village near Bakrani and offered condolences to the family of martyred pilot Major Saeed Ahmed Tunio, who embraced martyrdom in Lasbela chopper crash. 
They also laid wreath on the martyr’s grave.

He told journalists at Syed House, his residence, late on Wednesday night that everyone should act within the bounds of the constitution. If Punjab Chief Minister Pervaz Elahi came to Islamabad and lived in his own house it would be called chief minister’s house but if he resided in someone else’s house then it would not be called the chief minster’s house, he said.
He said that if someone, whether he was provincial or federal minister or even prime minister had conspired against the country then everyone should be equal before constitution and law. 
He demanded that a commission consisting of retired judges of higher judiciary should probe the case of prohibited funding. Imran Khan was speaking against Pakistani army while “we criticise the role of establishment and we never speak against the army,” he claimed.
He recalled that heads were decapitated, leaders were sent to the gallows and Benazir Bhutto was martyred, still “we never went against soldiers”.

5,"Federal government’s ‘policy of victimising opponents, journalists’ slammed",PTI's Haleem sees plot to pit PTI against army.,"HYDERABAD: Opposition Leader in Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh has said that federal government has surpassed all records of vindictive actions against opposition leaders as this regime has put even journalists and politicians in jails and conspiracy is being hatched to pit Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf against army.
He was speaking to journalists at sessions court after appearing before special judge of anticorruption (provincial) on Thursday for confirmation of the pre-arrest bail in a land transaction case. The court adjourned the case’s hearing till Aug 19. 
He said the government was bent on victimising the opposition. This imported government was appeasing its foreign masters after loss in by-election, he said.

Haleem sees plot to pit PTI against army

PTI was the largest party of the country and attempts were being made under a conspiracy to pit it against army, he said. 
He said that army stood by Pakistani nation. This imported government which had been rejected by people had first levelled accusations at judiciary. Shahbaz Gill was facing allegations that were not based on merit hence he must be given right to defence, he said. 
Nawaz Sharif had directly addressed a senior army officer by name and used unfair language against him but he was spared. Maryam Nawaz, Ayaz Sadiq, Pervez Rasheed were part of conspiracy aimed at weakening Pakistan army, he said.
Asif Zardari had issued statements to weaken the army because they were all part of a mafia that believed in undermining institutions while PTI believed in a strong army, he said. 
He said that conspiracy against PTI would fail and warned those who were hatching this conspiracy were playing with the very integrity of the country as it was climax of regime change operation.
Sheikh said that FIR about a land transaction of 1987 lodged against him was false. The FIR was lodged in the morning in Jamshoro and he was arrested in Lahore the same afternoon, he said. 
He said that high court had granted him bail with directives to have his statement recorded before anticorruption officials. When he appeared before the officials he was arrested. In the same manner, PTI leaders and workers were arrested in Islamabad, Karachi and other cities, he said.

Many girls and women, including elderly ones, could also be seen heading towards the three big temples in the city — the Shree Lakshmi Narayan Temple, the Shree Swaminarayan Temple and the Shree Ratneshwar Mahadev Temple for puja. The path to the temples were lined with sellers of rakhi, the pretty thread. Some were worth Rs10, some Rs50 and some, which happened to be imported from India, cost Rs100 and Rs200 as well. Although they were available in all colours, the best-sellers were the red ones with gold and silver beads in the middle because the red is recognised as the colour of happiness.  
The vendors also sold stuff to decorate the thali such as dried coconut, sweetmeats, fresh flowers, kumkum to mark the tilak on the forehead and even little gifts that any brother could buy and give to his sisters.  
The thali after the decoration is used for aarti to help ward the evil eye off the brothers.  
It is not necessary to tie rakhis on brothers’ wrists only as girls also tie the pretty thread on anyone whom they look up to as their brother.  
Some girls whose brothers are away from them are also known to mail or courier the rakhi thread to them. But one thing is a done deal: they always expect some little gift in return from their brothers. The usual gift is a sari but the gift of some piece of jewellery is also appreciated.

7,"DHA, CBC earn high court’s ire over failure to cope with flooding in Karachi","Judge says areas under DHA, CBC's jurisdiction have become nightmare for residents.","KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Thursday came down hard on the Cantonment Board Clifton (CBC) and Defence Housing Authority (DHA) over the situation that surfaced in the areas under their jurisdiction after the recent rains. 
A two-judge bench headed by Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi remarked that these areas had become a nightmare for their residents, and asked the counsel for the DHA if any data was gathered about the losses caused by rainwater. 
Justice Rizvi deplored that there were heaps of garbage in Clifton and DHA after the recent rains but nobody bothered to dispose them of. 
The bench made these remarks while hearing two petitions filed after flooding during and after the torrential rains in August 2020 in DHA and Clifton and the petitioners had sought formation of a committee to supervise sanitation projects and forensic audit of the CBC and DHA accounts. 
Justice Rizvi also asked the counsel for the respondents that they were collecting taxes from the areas in question, but why the situation was not improving. 
The judge said that earlier, a private company was lifting the garbage on a daily basis, but now the respondents themselves took the responsibility for the collection only once in a week. 
He warned of appointing a nazir for inspection after the counsel for the respondents insisted that the garbage was being lifted regularly. 
Justice Rizvi further remarked that the residents of such areas were distressed and the value of their properties was also declining while there was a fear of dengue outbreak due to lack of proper sanitation. 
The counsel for the DHA informed the bench that a contract to construct a nullah for drainage of rainwater in DHA Phase IV and VI had been awarded to the National Logistic Cell (NLC). 
He submitted that the NLC was undertaking the cleaning work of Korangi nullah after the bench asked him whether it had any experience of the field. 
One of the lawyers for the petitioners argued that the NED University of Engineering and Technology was seeking Rs20 million fee for the evaluation of drainage infrastructure in the areas coming under the CBC and DHA. 
In September previous year, the SHC had directed the NED university to conduct the evaluation of the drainage infrastructure within the jurisdictions of the CBC and DHA and sought its report within one month after the counsel for petitioners had asked the court to appoint a qualified sanitation engineer to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the drainage system in question.  
The court had also directed the CBC, DHA and the petitioners to provide requisite information and documents to the vice-chancellor of NED university and asked the petitioners to pay the fee of such evaluation to the university. 
Initially, around 60 residents had filed a petition before the SHC and sought formation of a committee to supervise sanitation projects and conducting a forensic audit of the CBC and DHA accounts after the auditor general’s report found irregularities. Later, another identical petition was also filed.

He added that the junk dealers were also arrested and booked along with the suspected thieves at the Baghdadi police station. 
The stolen articles were recovered and all four suspects were sent to jail on judicial remand till August 25. 
According to the area police, Farooq alias ‘doctor’ and Shiraz Taj had stolen eight items -- Hanuman’s maces and worship paraphernalia -- from a temple located in the Kamela (slaughter house) locality of Lyari during the night intervening July 26 and 27. 
SSP Bughio said the two suspects had been involved in petty crimes in the past. They used to steal different things and sell them to junk dealers to earn money, he added. 
An FIR (336/2022) was registered against them under sections 380 (Theft in dwelling house, etc), 457 (Lurking house-trespass or house-breaking by night in order to commit offence punishable with imprisonment) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). 
The area police said that Farooq alias doctor was picked up on spy information and on a lead given by him, his alleged accomplice, Shiraz Taj, was also apprehended. Following an interrogation with them, junk dealers Saifuddin and Zakaria Anwar, who had bought the stolen items, were picked up and these items were seized from them.  
The investigators added another section, 411 (Dishonestly receiving stolen property)of the PPC to the FIR against the held junk dealers.   
Baghdadi SHO Abdul Ghaffar Shah said that Farooq alias doctor was involved in four/five theft and drugs-related cases registered against him. He said that the eight idols stolen from the temple seemed to be 100-150 years old and had a significant value in the international market. Quoting the temple’s caretakers, the SHO put their estimated value at Rs2.6 million, and pointed out that the suspected thieves had sold them for Rs1,200 to the junk dealers, who were found offering them for Rs12,000-15,000 to potential customers. 
Meanwhile, all four suspects were produced in the court of Judicial Magistrate (South) Kamran Ali Kalhoro, who remanded them in judicial custody till August 25, our staff reporter Naeem Sahoutara adds.

Accordingly, the JM remanded them in judicial custody and directed the IO to produce them on August 25 along with his investigation report.

9,"Measures against forced conversion, misuse of blasphemy laws urged",Civil society activists also demand revision of curricula for minorities...,"KARACHI: The federal government must introduce legal and administrative safeguards to protect minorities against human rights violations, and take serious steps to stop forced faith conversions and ensure that blasphemy laws are not misused. 
This was demanded at a joint press conference held by civil society and human rights activists at the Karachi Press Club on Thursday to mark National Minorities’ Day. 
The press conference was addressed by Sindh Commission on Status of Women chairperson Nuzhat Shireen, MPA Naveed Anthony, Zahid Farooq of Urban Resource Centre, Naghma Iqtedar of The Knowledge Forum and Zafar Iqbal, a minorities rights activist.
“The founder of Pakistan, Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, envisioned Pakistan as a peaceful country, where there is no discrimination, intolerance, and violence on any ground and all citizens are able to enjoy equality of rights, opportunity, and treatment, and are free to practice their faiths. However, the government needs to introduce reforms for laws and policies that affect minorities,” said Naghma Iqtedar while reading out a statement.

Civil society activists also demand revision of curricula for minorities

“A majority of the cases under charges of blasphemy are based on fabricated accusations which make the accused face several years of imprisonment. In contrast, the complainant making false allegations enjoys impunity despite committing forgery, and sometimes the accusations lead to mob violence against the accused, and the minority community, which must be stopped with legal and administrative measures on the part of the government,” the statement added.
“Citizens are guaranteed the right to religious freedom in Article 20 of the Constitution of Pakistan. It is illegal and unethical to compel them to change their faith by use of threat, coercion, and/or manipulation.”
“Our society has been intoxicated with hatred, discrimination, and extremism due to a lack of inaction by the government machinery, which resulted in an increase in incidents of intolerance and violence in the name of religion. The government must effectively take action against those who take the law into their own hands and engage in targeting religious minorities,” the statement further read.   
It was said that the fulfillment of the rights of religious minorities is contingent upon an open acceptance of religious diversity and equal status as citizens. The real onus lies with the federal and provincial governments to address the gaps in governance, and address serious issues that minorities face in Pakistan.
The federal government has notified the curriculum for religious education solely for non-Muslim students for grades one to five and grades six to eight, which comprises content from seven religions, including Christianity, Hinduism, Sikhism, Baha’i, Kalash, Buddhism and Zoroastrianism, therefore, the Punjab and Sindh government must adopt a curriculum for the subject of religious education, and develop the textbooks and engage teachers to teach minority students the subject in schools.
The speakers called upon the federal and provincial governments to take measures in order to ensure equality of rights, religious freedom, and religious tolerance as per the constitution.
They said that affirmative action must be taken for the protection, promotion, and fulfillment of minority rights, particularly in the context of reforming the existing civil and criminal justice system to render it more sensitive to the needs of victims from minority communities. Moreover, use existing protections in the laws to prevent the miscarriage of justice, and bring the perpetrators and abettors involved to justice.
They added that a committee of experts comprising jurists and human rights activists should be constituted to revise the draft bill introducing safeguards against forced faith conversions in conformity with international human rights standards, including, in particular, with respect to religious freedom, as well as with the principle of legality.
They asked for a bill to amend the Child Marriage Restraint Act. It must be moved in the national and provincial legislative assemblies to ensure that the minimum marriageable age is set at 18 years for both boys and girls, and the marriage of minor children is declared null and void. As an interim measure, a hold should be placed on the validation of any marriages associated with faith conversions by the magistrates. It is necessary that verification or ascertaining of age, and freewill is required by senior civil judges in such cases.
They also sought a bill criminalising forced conversions to be tabled in the national and provincial legislative assemblies, and vetted by the standing committees of the parliament on human rights, and the ministry of law and justice, rather than the ministry or standing committee on religious affairs.
They called for ensuring that the allegations of forced conversion and forced marriage are independently, impartially, and promptly investigated keeping in view all conditions of coercion or threat under which marriages and religious conversions were made, and to apprehend the perpetrators and bring them to justice in proceedings that could guarantee the right to a fair trial, and ensure that victims had the right to access to justice and to an effective remedy.
They said that the authorities must “Introduce effective legal and administrative safeguards to prevent mob violence, and stop misuse of blasphemy laws for settling personal scores, political rivalries, or property disputes”. 
“They should ensure that all those who incite or engage in violence against others based on allegations of blasphemy, as well as those who falsely accuse others of blasphemy, are brought to justice and duly punished.”
The demanded that legislative and educational measures be taken to ensure that girls and women were free from physical abuse, domestic and sexual violence, or being subjected to any medical procedure without informed consent, and deprivation of reproductive autonomy and rights. The curricula and textbooks must be reviewed to make education an instrument for promoting diversity and social cohesion to comply with Article 22(1) of the Constitution, they urged.
“A quota should be introduced and implemented for admission to educational institutions for students belonging to religious minorities,” they concluded.

11,City to turn green & white with flags on Independence Day,"KARACHI: The deafening sound from the vuvuzela jolts Sheikh Nisar Ahmed Parchumwala, the biggest manufacturer of the...","KARACHI: The deafening sound from the vuvuzela jolts Sheikh Nisar Ahmed Parchumwala, the biggest manufacturer of the printed Pakistan flags, in his office in the centre of the Paper Market on Hassan Ali Effendi Road. 
“The horn is so noisy. It’s been banned in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. I wish they ban it here as well, but until they do that we are marketing it here because it is so much in demand,” laughed Parchumwala. 
The gentleman proudly shared that he is almost as old as Pakistan. “I’m turning 75 some 16 days after my country on August 30,” he said. 
A glance inside Hassan Ali Effendi Road makes you see everything in green. And the colour is splashed all over the city in the form of the fluttering flags, bunting, the green T-shirts, badges, lockets, hats, stickers, sunglasses, bracelets, bangles and other memorabilia. 
The biggest sellers among these are the flags. 
Parchumwala’s factory in Korangi manufactures these flags where they make sure the white portion on one side and the star and the crescent in the middle are according to the correct dimensions and also the green is the right shade. Some time ago the flag-maker, sometime also ran a movement for which he approached the court for a decree to stop tampering with the official flag design. 
It is a well-known fact that the flags used to be stitched earlier, with appliqué work done over the green material, which made them rather expensive. But Parchumwala, who also manufactured the stitched variety, then introduced the printed variety, which he produced on a large scale as they were quite inexpensive. Suddenly, you had flags fluttering on balconies, rooftops, cars, bikes, etc.  
In 2004, Parchumwala also created the Guinness world record for making the biggest flag in Pakistan. It was a 173,400 square feet flag that was spread out inside the National Stadium ground in Karachi. This year he wanted to make a one-kilometre-long flag to break that record. “But you need time to work on such a flag. It takes months. The airport would have been ideal for us to unfurl our one-km-long national flag. Sadly, no one in the government reached out to us for support as everyone there seems to be too busy with politics right now. So my plan did not materialise,” he said. 
This year, along with the usual ‘Jashn-i-Azadi Mubarak’ printed on most memorabilia, there is also mention of the 75 years of freedom. And Parchumwala has to be content with just that for now. “After all, we couldn’t have let this grand occasion go totally unnoticed,” he smiled.

The book chronicles 75 years of the country’s cultural traditions, initiatives and victories, says a statement issued by the publishing house on Thursday.
Divided into pre- and post-partition eras, the book chronicles decades leading up to 2020s and creatively illustrates the evolution of popular culture within Pakistan, it says.
“Popular culture emerges from the people for the people. It is organic. Unfortunately, its history and evolution hasn’t been very well documented in Pakistan. My book attempts to explore this evolution as a way to celebrate it, and more so, understand what drives it,” said Mr Paracha at the launch of his book.
Marking CEO Kiran Aman said: “We are delighted to publish NFP’s work, reflective of his signature satire and his unique lens on the history of Pakistan. The book is a fascinating journey through Pakistan’s popular culture, relevant across generations.”
The formal launch of the book was scheduled for Thursday (Aug 11) at the Koel Art Gallery, but had to be postponed due to weather situation.

13,Stay against exhumation of Aamir Liaquat’s body extended,Judge directs family's counsel to submit relevant documents at next hearing.,"KARACHI: A sessions’ court on Thursday extended till Aug 16 stay against exhumation of the body of late Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf MNA Dr Aamir Liaquat Hussain for a post-mortem examination.  
Additional Sessions Judge-II (East) Ghulam Mustafa Leghari also directed the counsel representing the lawmaker’s family — Dua-e-Aamir and Ahmed Aamir — to submit relevant documents on the next date and adjourned hearing.  
The family had challenged the June 18 order of a judicial magistrate that allowed a citizen’s application to exhume their father’s body to ascertain the “actual cause of his death”.  
The magistrate had observed that the cause of death was still uncertain, which itself had raised question about either it was natural or unnatural and could only be ascertained after exhumation of the body and its post-mortem examination.  
However, the lawmaker’s family claimed that the citizen, Ahad, on account of his previous political rivalry with the late MNA had filed the application for exhuming the body for an autopsy.  
The applicants apprehended that they might suffer an irreparable loss if the stay order against the exhumation was not granted.  
Earlier, the MNA’s family had challenged the magistrate’s decision in the Sindh High Court that had granted an interim stay against exhumation of the body.
