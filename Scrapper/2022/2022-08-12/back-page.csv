Rahimullah Haqqani

 
KABUL: A senior Taliban cleric known for his fiery speeches against the militant Islamic State (IS) group and support for female education, was killed in a suicide blast at his madressah in the Afghan capital on Thursday.
Rahimullah Haqqani, who had recently spoken publicly in favour of girls being allowed to attend school, had survived at least two previous assassination attempts — including one in Pakistan in October 2020.
“The madrassa of Sheikh Rahimullah was targeted today and as a result he and one of his brothers were martyred,” Kabul police spokesman Khalid Zadran told AFP, adding that three others were wounded in the blast.
Government spokesman Bilal Karimi confirmed Haqqani’s death “in an attack carried out by a cowardly enemy”, but did not offer further details.

Haqqani backed girls’ right to attend school; IS claims responsibility for attack

Despite sharing the same name, the cleric was not related to Afghanistan’s Haqqani militant group network. 
Hours later, IS claimed the attack on its telegram channels, saying the bomber had detonated his explosive vest inside the cleric’s office. 
However, Reuters claimed the attacker detonated explosives “hidden in a plastic artificial leg”, quoting officials and Taliban sources.  
Four Taliban sources told Reuters the attacker was someone who had previously lost his leg and had hidden the explosives in a plastic artificial leg. 
“We are investigating who this ... person was and who had brought him to this important place to enter the personal office of Sheikh Rahimullah Haqqani. It’s a very huge loss for the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan,” said one senior Taliban official of the interior ministry. 
Haqqani was one of the most “prominent advocates for the Taliban and one of the biggest of them who incited to fight” IS, jihadist monitoring group SITE said, translating a statement from IS. 
Taliban sources said that although he held no official position, Haqqani was an influential figure who had taught many of the group’s members over the years. 
Scores of Taliban officials took to social media to express their condolences. 
“You have fulfilled your responsibility. Destiny cannot be prevented, but the Muslim community has been orphaned,” tweeted Mobin Khan, a former spokesman for the Kabul police. 
Haqqani was known for angry speeches against IS, that has claimed several attacks in Afghanistan since the Taliban’s return to power in August last year. 
In recent months, Haqq­ani also backed the right of girls to attend school. 
“There is no justification in Sharia to say female education is not allowed. No justification at all,” he told the BBC in an interview in May. 
He added: “All the religious books have stated female education is permissible and obligatory, because, for example, if a woman gets sick, in an Islamic environment like Afghanistan or Pakistan, and needs treatment, it’s much better if she’s treated by a female doctor.”
Since seizing power, the Taliban have imposed harsh restrictions on girls and women. They have not allo­wed secondary schools for girls to reopen in most parts of the country.

1,Armed man tries to break into FBI building in Ohio,Flees after exchange of fire with officers; no officials injured.,"Cincinnati: Police were locked in a standoff on Thursday with an armed man who tried to breach the FBI building in Cincinnati, Ohio, earlier in the day before fleeing and exchanging gunfire with officers, authorities said.
The incident was still active as of Thursday afternoon but contained, an Ohio state official told reporters in a press briefing. Authorities said no officials were injured and the suspect was not successful in breaching the building.
“Law enforcement has traded shots with a male suspect who is wearing a gray shirt and body armor,” Clinton County Emergency Management Agency said earlier, urging people in the area to stay inside and lock their doors.
NBC News reported that the suspect, who was armed with an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle, fired a nail gun into the building. Authorities shut down two highways and imposed an area lockdown.
The suspect was fleeing in a white vehicle when he fired shots, authorities said.
The man tried to breach the FBI building’s Visitor Screening Facility before fleeing north onto Interstate 71, the FBI Cincinnati field office wrote on Twitter. Details and the motive were unclear.

 





 
The FBI has been the subject of online threats since its agents searched former President Donald Trump’s Florida estate this week to probe whether he illegally removed records from the White House as he was leaving office.

2,"China explains move to place ‘hold’ on Indian, US bid against JeM leader Abdul Rauf Azhar","""We placed a hold because we need more time to study the case,"" says spokesperson for China’s mission to UN.","UNITED NATIONS: China on Thursday defended its decision to delay a proposal by the United States and India at the UN Security Council to sanction Abdul Rauf Azhar, a senior commander of Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) and brother of the militant group’s founder and leader Masood Azhar.
India and the United States want Abdul Rauf to be subjected to a global travel ban and asset freeze. The move has to be agreed by all 15 members of a Security Council sanctions committee.
“We placed a hold because we need more time to study the case. Placing holds is provided for by the committee guidelines, and there have been quite a number of similar holds by committee members on listing requests,” a spokesperson for China’s mission to the United Nations said.

New Delhi, Washington want ban on Abdul Rauf’s travel and freeze on his assets

Asked for further comment at a regular briefing in Beijing on Thursday, a spokesman for China’s foreign ministry defended the country’s track record at the sanctions committee, also known as the 1267 Committee, and asked the media not to “speculate”.
“China has always participated in the work of the 1267 Committee in a constructive and responsible manner in strict accordance with the rules and procedures of the committee, and we hope that other members will do the same,” foreign ministry’s Wang Wenbin said.
The US Treasury designated Abdul Rauf Azhar in 2010, accusing him of urging Pakistanis to engage in militant activities and organise suicide attacks in India.
The United States respects other countries needs to verify that a sanctions proposal meets their “domestic evidentiary threshold to justify a listing at the UN,” a spokesperson for the US mission to the United Nations said on Wednesday.
“The United States values cooperation with our Security Council partners to effectively use this tool in an apolitical way to stop terrorists from exploiting the global order to do their misdeeds,” the spokesperson said.

The premier made these remarks during a meeting with the newly-arrived envoy of the European Union to Pakistan, Dr Riina Kionka, at the Prime Minister House.

Pakistan will continue to be part of the arrangement beyond 2023,” the prime minister said as per the statement issued after the meeting. He said the sustained high-level exchanges between Pakistan and the European Union were vital to further strengthen the partnership.

Recalling his recent telephone conversations with EU Council President Charles Michel and President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, the prime minister expressed confidence that the upcoming visits to Pakistan by the EU parliamentary delegations, as well as the next rounds of political and security dialogues under EU-Pakistan Strategic Engagement Plan, would pave the way for more substantive cooperation between the two sides. 
Discussing Afghanistan, PM Sharif stressed the need for a peaceful and stable Afghanistan. He also highlighted the “unprecedented level of cooperation” that Pakistan had extended to the international community with regard to Afghanistan, especially since the takeover of Kabul by the Taliban in August last year.

On the occasion of National Minorities Day on Aug 11, Shehbaz Sharif reaffirmed the coalition government’s resolve for the betterment and welfare of minorities and their fullest inclusion in national life and development.
He said the government was committed to these obligations and “officially celebrates the 11th of August to reiterate its resolve towards the achievement of the noble objective of building an inclusive society” in line with the vision of the Quaid-i-Azam. 
The PM said the government was taking steps to “mainstream minorities in the country by ensuring a level-playing field for them”.
“The idea is to enable and facilitate all segments of society, particularly our non-Muslim citizens, to take a full part in the national life,” he said in his message on the National Day of Minorities.
