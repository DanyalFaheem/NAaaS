0,Punjab takes the flak for removal of Lahore's National Stadium AstroTurf,"""It is wrong to say the the turf was quite old and not fit for a game,"" former hockey star Manzoorul Hasan Senior says.","LAHORE: Former hockey star Olympian Manzoorul Hasan Senior has hit out at the Punjab government’s decision of removing the AstroTurf of the National Hockey Stadium for the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf (PTI) public rally and described it as a great loss of hockey.  
It is said to be the biggest hockey stadium in Asia and has hosted several momentous tournaments such as World Cup.  
Speaking to Dawn on Thursday after the news of removal of the AstroTurf went viral, the former hockey great said he was deeply disappointed over the Punjab government’s decision of ruining the stadium. He questioned Punjab Sports Minister Malik Taimoor Masood’s claim that the turf was being replaced and now it would be installed in Sargodha and that it had to be changed by the Buzdar government because it was already quite old.  
“The turf in Sargodha is already there and boys play there without any complaint. In fact, the turf is not available in Faisalabad for the last one year as tenders have not been issued,” Manzoor said. 
“It is wrong to say the the turf was quite old and not fit for a game. Last month, the Chief of Army Staff Inter-Club Tournament was played on it and the players enjoyed the tournament without any complaint,” Manzoor said. 
“Yes, the only problem it had was that it was not perfectly placed when it was laid around 10 years ago. But its surface was in a perfect condition,” he said.  
He also said not a single turf was laid by the Punjab government in the last four years and now the decision to remove the one added insult to injury. He said a protest meeting would be organised in front of the National Hockey Stadium on Friday.  
Manzoor said there was no need to remove the turf as the cost of a new one had increased manifold due to the surge in dollar value.  
The turf was uprooted on the order of Punjab Sports Minister Malik Taimoor to facilitate the PTI to hold its public meeting on Saturday (tomorrow). The party shifted the event from Islamabad to Lahore a few days ago. 
The stadium has a seating capacity of around 65,000 spectators and can also entertain 15,000 or so more people in the playing area. The National Stadium was inaugurated by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif in mid-80s when he was a provincial minister.  
The Punjab sports minister told media on Thursday that the decision to change the turf had already been taken by the previous government (led by Usman Buzdar), so it was not being replaced owing to the public rally. The minister said the tender for the new turf would be given in the next few days and the project would be completed in the next four to five months.  
He said the turf was laid some 10 years ago at a cost of Rs40 million and now the latest cost would be known after issuing tenders. He said the old turf would be laid in another city of the province despite the fact it had completed its playing-age. 
The minister also claimed that it was not a political rally but it was being held as part of Independence Day celebrations. He said cultural shows would also be part of the event. 
It will be the first time that such a public meeting by a political party will be held at the National Hockey Stadium. In 1974, former Libyan president Moammar Gaddafi had addressed a public meeting at Lahore Stadium (which was renamed Gaddafi Stadium) when he was in Lahore to attend the Islamic summit.  
On Oct 20, 2012, the turf was folded to host a ceremony of singing the national anthem by a large number of people to break the record of India. Around 70,000 Pakistanis gathered at the stadium to sing the national anthem.  
The stadium had previously been used to hold music concerts which left it in poor condition. Officials of the Pakistan Hockey Federation which has its offices in the stadium are tight-lipped as the stadium is in full control of the Punjab Sports Board. 
A former Olympian said he was in consultation with other stars of  yesteryear and they were likely to hold a protest at Liberty Chowk on Friday.  
Meanwhile, PM’s special assistant Atta Tarrar has sent a legal notice to the chief secretary Punjab,  the commissioner Lahore and DG Sports Board on the matter of removing  AstroTurf from Lahore’s stadium ahead of PTI’s power show, according to a report.

In a fresh legal notice, she also demanded an “unconditional apology’ from Mr Tararr within seven days of receiving the notice. The notice was served on Tarrar through her lawyer Azhar Siddique. 
She also demanded that Mr Tararr pay her Rs5 billion for using the derogatory and defamatory term (Gogi) in the past and an additional Rs5bn for using the same term once again in London in May 2022. “Since Tarrar has not adhered to the requests made in the earlier notices, we are hereby intimating you that we are initiating defamation proceedings against you before the court of competent jurisdiction,” the notice says. 
Farhat is reportedly in the UAE while back in Pakistan, the Shehbaz government says it would bring her to Pakistan following the initiation of an investigation by the National Accountability Bureau into her assets beyond means. Hamza Shehbaz being the chief minister of Punjab had also ordered the Anti-Corruption Establishment to investigate her land transactions in the province. Subsequently, Farah, her mother and many others were booked for illegal allotment of some industrial plots. 
Tarrar alleged that Farhat accumulated “assets worth billions of rupees”. 
Calling her Farah Gogi, Tararr alleged that she used to “approve transfers and appointments” of government officials in Punjab against hefty payments and the wealth was spent on purchasing diamonds worth billions of rupees.  
He alleged that “the matter is not confined to diamond dealings as information about the selling of expensive paintings and watches will come to the fore soon”. 
He called upon the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf chairman to tell her Gogi to return home and join investigations.

4,PR police to launch Safar Sahaili app by month end,"Move aims at protecting women, children from harassment in trains","LAHORE: In a bid to protect woman passengers and their children in particular and others in general during journey on all routes, Pakistan Railways (PR) police is set to launch a mobile phone application (App) through which anyone seeking help will be responded immediately.  
Besides this, the police are also working on a proposal to install state-of-the-art cameras in trains that would be connected with a central control room to monitor activities of those involved in teasing passengers, especially women and their kids during journey, Dawn learnt on Thursday. 
“The App namely Safar Sahaili (female friend during journey) is set to be launched by end of this month. Anyone, especially women and their kids travelling by rail network, can easily use this by clicking “Panic Button” in case of emergency. After doing so, a message for railway police as well as the respective district police would alert the officials, including those on duty in train, forcing them to rush to the spot and help the complainant without wasting time,” an official source privy to the development told Dawn on Thursday.  
“Hopefully, the App would be introduced by end of the ongoing month,” he added. 

Move aims at protecting women, children from harassment in trains 

It merits mentioning that the decision to introduce the App was taken in the backdrop of the May 27 tragic incident in which a woman passenger, while travelling alone after being deprived of meeting with her kids by her ex-husband at Multan railway station in Karachi-bound Bahauddin Zakria Express, was gang-raped by some employees of the train’s private operators.
Later, a PR police patrol in Mehr Express also arrested two people for harassing a woman passenger who was travelling to Multan from Rawalpindi in coach No. 8 of the train after two male passengers started teasing her, leaving her with no option but to complain to the PR police officials. Similarly, some other incidents related to the safety and protection of the woman passengers were also reported. 
However, it was learnt that there was no deployment of the PR police officials in the train for safety and security of passengers as, under a contract, the provision of security arrangement in the train was the duty of the private operator and not of the railway police.  
The police said since the train was being run by a private firm/contractor after its commercial operation was outsourced to it by the PR, it was the contractor’s responsibility to deploy security officials in the train. 
“The App will have three interface, connecting passengers with train, patrolling police and the control room, which will be ready within a week or so. A passenger is just required to click/press the panic button after which he/she will be responded within the shortest possible time,” the official said. 
He said the training session had also been arranged recently for police officials, conductor, guards travelling in trains and others concerned by the National Information Technology Board. 
About other initiatives being taken soon, the official said the PR police also planned to get the latest cameras installed in the coaches of all passenger trains. For this a separate central monitoring room would also be established as the work is under way in this regard these days.  
“These cameras will have a feature of two-way communication that allows the monitor to intervene and direct the official on duty to check in case of any issue,” he said, adding that Federal Minister for Railways Khwaja Saad Rafique has also been requested to end shortage of the sanctioned strength of the PR police, as 2,500 posts were lying vacant.

The Lassani Express passenger train going from Lahore to Narowal/Sialkot remained standing for two hours between Qila Ahmedabad and Pasrur. The train was not allowed to pass due to the rapid flow of floodwater on the track. The railway administration brought the Lassani Express back to the Qila Ahmed Railway Station and asked the passengers to vacate the train. The passengers had to take vans and buses for travel while the train returned to the Narowal Railway Station. 
Station Master Javed Shah said the train going from Sialkot to Karachi through Narowal would now take the route of the Wazirabad railway section on Friday (today) and the Lassani Express train will be dispatched to Lahore from Narowal.

Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi said this during a meeting with a delegation, headed by FPCCI President Irfan Iqbal Sheikh.
He said: “We would provide more facilities to traders and the industrialists in the province. State of the art special economic zones will be set up in the province and we will get benefit from a successful model of the world in this regard.”
The chief minister maintained he would take decisions in consultation with stakeholders, adding that the process of meetings with traders and the industrialists would go on. He revealed that a focal person will be appointed in his office in order to resolve the problems of the traders and the industrialists.

“It seems the province is being pushed towards security crisis under a conspiracy,” he said in a statement issued here from Mansoorah on Thursday.  
He said the prime minister and KP chief minister would be direct responsible if something bad happened in the area. He said people of KP were worried about the security situation in the Dir valley.
He said the PTI had been ruling KP for over nine years but it did nothing for the welfare of the public. He held the PDM and the PPP equally responsible for the destruction of the national economy.  
He said the incumbent and previous governments had destroyed every sector and created multiple crises. He said the bad governance, corruption and ill-conceived economic policies were the root-causes of the problems. The country needed honest and dedicated leadership to pull it out of prevailing circumstances. He said along with inflation, unemployment and load shedding, the masses were also worried about their protection now.  
He also reiterated demand to abolish interest-based economy, asking the government to withdraw appeal from the Supreme Court against the decision of the Federal Shariah Court.
Meanwhile, the JI will start countrywide protest movement against inflated bills from Friday.
The JI chief will address the central rally in Peshawar while protests demonstrations will be held in Islamabad and Lahore on Aug 15 and 17, respectively. The JI chief said the protest movement would continue until the government withdrew taxes included in the electricity bills. He said if a user consumed electricity of worth Rs4000, over Rs8000 were included in the bills in the form of different taxes.

This was emphasised by the participants in a protest demonstration staged by the Voice for Justice (VFJ) to mark the National Minorities Day on Thursday. 
Speaking on the occasion, Ashiknaz Khokhar said Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, in his address to the Constituent Assembly on Aug 11, 1947, had declared the protection of minorities’ rights a distinct duty of the state and made a pledge to promote religious freedom and tolerance, equality and non-discrimination for all in Pakistan. He demanded the government must take effective measures to address the dynamics and the impact of discrimination, exclusion, and 
inequalities in order to reduce the exposure of minorities to persecution, insecurity and violence. 
Joseph Jansen, the chairperson at the Voice for Justice, said it was unfortunate that the religious minorities had been facing 
historical injustice or discrimination committed against them despite having made a significant contribution to the creation and establishment of Pakistan.  
“The government should encourage effective participation and the constructive integration of minorities in all areas of civil, political, economic, social, and cultural life of society,” he added. 
Nadia Stephen said the right to religious freedom prohibited the use of coercion to make someone change their religion. 
Therefore, the government must introduce a comprehensive bill criminalising forced faith conversions to bring the perpetrators to justice for their crimes involving child marriage, forced conversion and sexual violence. 
Abid Chand said the government must create favourable conditions to ensure that the minorities were able to express their concerns and engage in the national dialogue on policy matters and identify solutions to address human rights issues. He demanded the constitution of a statutory National Commission for Minorities’ Rights with a mandate to monitor the implementation of minority rights, address violations and contribute advice for policy reforms in order to strengthen protection for minority rights. 
Emmanuel Sardar said although the government had introduced an affirmative measure for the minorities’ empowerment by allocating a 5pc reserved quota in the public sector jobs; however, they were less likely to benefit from this provision due to a lack of trust in the recruitment process and absence of a redress mechanism. He demanded that a regulatory body must be established with a mandate to monitor and address complaints in order to enforce the job quota reserved for religious minorities. 
Imran Javed said that advancing religious freedom was a human rights obligation of the states; therefore, the government needed to fulfill its responsibility towards protecting the rights and take measures to ensure freedom and justice for marginalised groups, particularly the minorities. 
Saleem Shoukat said the minorities should not be treated differently and they must not face discrimination, hatred or violence solely on the basis of their particular faith. The government must take legal and administrative measures to ensure effective non-discrimination and de facto equality for all, he said and added that it should take serious actions against the actors involved in committing persecution to better respond to violence targeted against the minorities.

The students and teachers of the city’s educational institutions were the worst victim’s of the heavy rain as almost all the city roads were submerged by rainwater. 
The rain started around 9.30am and until 1pm at least 250mm rain was recorded, said an official of the Gujrat Municipal Corporation. 
He said city’s disposal stations functioned up to full capacity and machines and de-watering sets remained operational in various parts of the city. 
People lodged a protest against the civic authorities and district administration for their failure to take measures to minimise the damage from urban flooding as cleaning of drains and sewerage could not be done timely. 
The rainwater entered the houses in most areas, causing a huge damage to the public properties. The students, teachers and parents were compelled to face the danger of passing through the rainwater as pick and drop transport services could not be able to provide the facility.  
Deputy Commissioner Amer Shahzad Kang, Assistant Commissioner Ahsan Mumtaz and officials of the MC inspected the disposal stations in the city and also visited various parts of the city. 
An official of MC said the civic agency had also launched a rescue service by using its tractor-trailers to transport the stranded people up to their respective areas.

15,Lumpy skin a nightmare for farmers post-Eid,"MUZAFFARGARH: More than 1,100 animals in Muzaffargarh and over 800 in Layyah districts had died of Lumpy Skin ...","MUZAFFARGARH: More than 1,100 animals in Muzaffargarh and over 800 in Layyah districts had died of Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) and thousands contracted the virus after Eidul Azha, claimed district livestock officials on Thursday.  
District livestock officer Dr Mohammed Tariq said the virus basically came from South Africa to Karachi around six months back. He said his teams were busy treating the animals through ‘herbal method’ as no medicines were available.  
“Farmers just know about fever and flu to animals and now cattle farm owners are worried about the situation,” he said.  
Cattle farm owners -- Umer and Shahnawaz -- said last year they earned profit worth millions of rupees from sale of animals and now finding a buyer has become a difficult task.  
Umer claimed that the Eidul Azha [season] was a great loss for him as he had to sell four-maund (160 kg) cow at only Rs60,000 while its actual rate was Rs120,000.  
He said he off and on complained to livestock department office but the officials said they had no medicines or vaccine and gave ‘herbal medicines tips’.
The symptoms of the disease are: fever, watery eyes, runny nose, inflammation of the lymph nodes, loss of appetite and decrease in milk production. According to a vet, animals suffer from stress, rashes appear on the skin and spread throughout the body. Rashes are mostly noticeable on the animal’s head, neck and legs.  
He said the virus can be spread from one animal to another by mosquitoes, insect bites and drinking water in a manger.
