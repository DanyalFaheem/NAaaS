0,Islamabad gets three bids for Washington property,The highest bid of almost $6.8 million is from a Jewish group that wants to build a synagogue in the building.,"WASHINGTON: Pakistan has rece­ived three bids for a building which once housed the defence section of the country’s embassy in the US capital.
The highest bid of almost $6.8 million is from a Jewish group that wants to build a synagogue in the building, diplomatic sources in Washington told Dawn. 
The second bid of about $5 million is from an Indian realtor and the third of about $4 million is from a Pakistani realtor, the sources added.
Pakistani-Americans in the realty market say that the building should go for the highest bidder. “We should follow this tradition, also because it will create a lot of goodwill in an influential American community, which wants to use it as a place of worship,” a Pakistani realtor, who requested to remain anonymous, said.
Earlier this month, Pakistan embassy officials told Dawn that one of the country’s three diplomatic properties in Washington — a building on the prestigious R Street NW — was up for sale. 
The officials, however, clarified that neither the new nor the old embassies were being sold. The R Street building housed the embassy’s defence section from the mid 1950s to early 2000s.
Earlier on Monday, the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation (CCoP) asked the privatisation commission to appoint a financial adviser for leasing the Roosevelt Hotel site in New York.
The government is considering a joint venture for a prospective mixed-used development of the site, which Pakistan owns. Finance Minister Ishaq Dar chaired the meeting.
In Washington, embassy officials told Dawn that they were also consulting an appraiser to assess what’s better: to sell the building as it is, or to do so after renovation.  “We are in no rush, and we will not conclude a deal that does not benefit Pakistan,” the embassy official said. The federal cabinet has already approved the sale.
Earlier posts on social media displayed two buildings: both the present and the old embassies, claiming that these two buildings were also up for sale.
But embassy officials said none of these two buildings were on the market. The current embassy is in a new building constructed in the early 2000s while the old embassy was in the heart of town, on Massachusetts Avenue, close to the Indian embassy.
The embassy moved to the new building in the early 2000s, but it is also keeping the old building and has spent close to seven million dollars in renovating it and the nearby official residence of the ambassador.
The amount spent on the renovation, however, surprised many, with some demanding a probe to determine why it cost so much. The R Street building, however, has never been renovated and a visit to the site showed that it was in dilapidated conditions.
Other residents of the area confirmed that they had complained to the local authorities about the state of the building which, they said, was now “a security hazard”. The R Street building was purchased by Ambassador Syed Amjad Ali between 1953 and 1956. 
The old embassy was purchased by Pakistan’s first ambassador to the US, M.A.H. Ispahani. Both buildings have remained unoccupied for almost 20 years now.  A former Pakistani ambassador told Dawn that two ambassadors Jalil Abbas Jilani and Sherry Rehman had previously come close to selling the old embassy building but the government withdrew after a media uproar. “Personally, I am in favour of selling all unoccupied buildings,” the former ambassador said. 
“We have already wasted a lot of money in retaining these buildings for so long.” Yet another embassy official rejected the suggestion that the embassy was unable to pay its diplomatic and other staff and that’s why it was selling its properties. “Every embassy employee — diplomatic or non-diplomatic — is paid on time,” the official said.

1,China deployed 71 warplanes in weekend war drills: Taiwan,Beijing says it conducted ‘strike drill’ in response to ‘collusion’ between US and self-ruled island.,"TAIPEI: China deployed 71 warplanes in weekend military exercises around Taiwan, Taipei’s defence ministry said on Monday, including dozens of fighter jets in one of the biggest daily incursions to date. 
The People’s Liberation Army said it had conducted a “strike drill” on Sunday in response to unspecified “provocations” and “collusion” between the United States and the self-ruled island. 
Data from Taiwan’s defence ministry showed those drills were one of the largest since they started releasing daily tallies. 
In a post on Twitter, Taiwan said 60 fighter jets took part in the drills, including six Su-30 warplanes, some of China’s most advanced. 

Beijing says it conducted ‘strike drill’ in response to ‘collusion’ between US and self-ruled island

Moreover, 47 of the sorties crossed into the island’s air defence identification zone (ADIZ), the third-highest daily incursion on record, according to AFP’s database. 
Chiu Tai-san, head of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), Taiwan’s top China policy-making body, expressed “strong dissatisfaction” at the latest incursions during a parliament session on Monday. 
Taiwan lives under constant threat of invasion by China, which claims the democratic island as part of its territory, to be taken one day. Beijing has ramped up military, diplomatic and economic pressure on Taiwan under President Xi Jinping as relations have deteriorated. One of the pressure tactics China has increasingly used is probing Taiwan’s ADIZ with its warplanes. 
According to an AFP database, there have been more than 1,700 such incursions so far this year, compared with 969 in 2021. Taiwan’s defence ministry said it recorded around 380 incursions in 2020. 
China did not specify the number of aircraft mobilised for Sunday’s exercises, nor the exact location of the manoeuvres. 
Taiwan’s daily tally showed most of the incursions crossed the “median line” which runs down the Taiwan Strait separating the two sides, while a smaller number went through Taiwan’s southwestern ADIZ. 
Record bomber incursion 
Many nations maintain air defence identification zones, including the United States, Canada, South Korea, Japan and China. They are not the same as a country’s airspace. 
Instead, they encompass a much wider area, in which any foreign aircraft is expected to announce itself to local aviation authorities.
Taiwan’s ADIZ is much larger than its airspace. It overlaps part of China’s ADIZ and even includes some of the mainland. 
The PLA said Sunday’s exercises were “a firm response to the escalating collusion and provocations by the US and the Taiwanese authorities”. 
Beijing has been incensed by US President Joe Biden’s handling of Taiwan — especially after he said Washington would defend it militarily if attacked by China. 
Taiwan’s defence ministry said on Sunday that cooperation between Taipei and Washington would “help (maintain) freedom, openness, peace and stability” in the Asia-Pacific region. 
The prospect of a Chinese invasion has increasingly rattled both Western nations and many of China’s neighbours. 
Xi, China’s most authoritarian leader in decades, has said that the process of what he calls the “reunification” of Taiwan cannot be passed on to future generations.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has also heightened fears China might try something similar. 
The United States has stepped up support for Taiwan including a bill this month that authorised $10 billion in military aid, to which Beijing expressed “strong opposition”. 
Tensions peaked in August during US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan, with the PLA staging huge military drills around the island in protest.
Military flights into the ADIZ are seen as a way to both wear down Taiwan’s ageing fleet of fighters as well as probe its defensive responses. 
There has also been an increase in sorties by China’s nuclear-capable H-6 bombers. 
China this month sent a record 18 H-6 bombers into the southwestern ADIZ in the largest daily incursion to date.

2,FOOTPRINTS: SCIENCE FOR ALL,"“Here, children are very happy to do experiments and our summer camp school earlier this year was overflowing,” says Dr Hoodbhoy.","I feel a bit out of my depth as Dr Pervez Hoodbhoy demonstrates simple, yet fascinating, experiments at the children’s science lab on the first floor of ‘The Black Hole’. This lab is for kids aged 12-16, Dr Hoodbhoy tells me as he continues to tinker with an electroscope — an early scientific tool used to detect electric charge on a body — but I find myself as captivated as a fifth grader might be.
On the wall to my right, a whiteboard is littered with math equations; on the other side hangs a copy of the periodic table. “Usually, this lab is filled with kids,” Dr Hoodbhoy says as I observe my surroundings.
I ran into Dr Hoodbhoy outside ‘The Black Hole’ (or TBH for short) and he was kind enough to take me on a tour of the facility.
TBH is located in a street just off the pine-lined Ibne Sina Road, surrounded by Soviet-style apartment blocks and hostels. The exterior, adorned with brown arches apparently inspired by Renaissance architecture, stands out in the otherwise mundane Islamabad alley.
In addition to a science lab, the facility also houses a cafe and library, where a picture frame of public intellectual Eqbal Ahmed adorns the wall amid rows of books and magazine stands.
The purpose of TBH — where concepts of high science are explained in simple terms — is to make science popular, alongside promoting music, culture, and discussion around social issues.
The way science is taught in schools, says Dr Hoodbhoy, is so tedious that it usually drives people away. TBH aims to change that.
“Here, children are very happy to do experiments and our summer camp school earlier this year was overflowing,” the jeans and jacket-clad intellectual tells me as he shares a pamphlet about an upcoming winter camp.
It is almost time for a talk by the guest speaker, Dr Aquib Moin. We walk together to the auditorium in the basement and I plant myself in the fifth row, far enough back to observe how those in the audience will react without going out of earshot.
One of the first things that catches my eye are the illustrations painstakingly drawn (and coloured) in chalk across the hall blackboard. Is it graffiti, I wonder to myself.
Later, I track down the in-house artist, Mr Alam to satiate my curiosity. “I don’t have a particular name for this, I just stand in front of the board and draw whatever comes to mind,” he tells me.
Nayyar Afaq, who is part of the TBH team, describes them like poetry. “In the words of Ghalib: ‘aate haiñ ghaib se ye mazamin khayal meñ’ (out of the unseen these thoughts are conceived).”
The Black Hole has organised more than 300 events since it opened in March this year and every piece of blackboard art displayed since has been unique.
Back in the hall, which is nearly brimming with college and university-going students by now, Dr Moin is talking about ‘Space R&D and the Intellectual Capacity Building Loop’.
He shares information about the Emirati space programme and its Mars mission. However, the conversation soon turns to the education system’s impact on science. There is an agreement between Dr Hoodbhoy and the speaker that ‘intellectual capacity building’ does not come with degrees, but only through reasoning and critical thinking.
“The degree only teaches you know-how about a subject, but intellectual capacity is acquired through the use of reason that helps you become proficient at interpreting things,” Dr Moin says.
Dr Hoodbhoy blames this deficiency on the ‘rote learning’ inherent in the local education system and calls it antithetical to the progress of science in the country.
India’s space programme was started after Pakistan but now it’s sending missions to outer space and also leading in the IT sector, he says.
The UAE is not too different, Dr Moin tells his audience. Even though they have been sending missions to space — a source of national pride — they have not developed their homegrown intellectual capacity proportionally, he said.
As the talk ended, I asked Daud, a student intending to study at the National Defence University, about his experience at TBH. “I mostly sit in the library but [I] do attend events in the auditorium,” he responded. These lectures are an opportunity to develop a thorough understanding of a topic “as opposed to books which only give a preview”, he told Dawn.
Like T2F in Karachi and Cafe Bol in Lahore, this place provides a space for intellectual conversations in a vibrant atmosphere.
It is already dark outside as I leave the building; and as I exit, I ponder the providence of the name ‘The Black Hole’. While its namesake cosmic phenomena may be considered a ‘graveyard of stars’, one can hope that the terrestrial TBH will help produce some bright minds in the days to come.

3,"Protesters tear-gassed, held as violence erupts in Gwadar",Home minister vows to maintain writ of state; leaves door open for talks with Haq Do Tehreek.,"GWADAR / QUETTA: Balochistan Home Minister Mir Ziaullah Langove has warned anyone who challenges the state writ would be dealt with an iron fist, shortly after Haq Do Tehreek (HDT) activists and police clashed on the streets of Gwadar, during which the main gate of police complex was also set on fire.
Violent protesters were tear-gassed and over a dozen arrested during the crackdown on Monday, a day after talks between the two sides for a settlement to end the two-month-long sit-in failed to make any headway.
While all commercial activities remained suspended across the port city and public transport stayed off the road during the day as HDT leader Maulana Hidayatur Rahman gave a strike call, the protesters marched on roads and hurled rocks at the police complex of DIG Makran Range before burning its main gate.
 
 

As they also put barricades and hurdles on the road leading towards the port, police lobbed tear gas shells to disperse the mob, that turned violent after police action. Shutdown was also reported from Pasni, Jewani and Ormara.

Home minister vows to maintain writ of state; leaves door open for talks with Haq Do Tehreek

Balochistan Home Minister Mir Ziaullah Langove, meanwhile, told a presser that law enforcement agencies took strict action against the protesters for trying to block Gwadar deep sea port and suspend development work in the area, as they had besieged roads leading to sensitive installations, navy offices, the Pearl Continental Hotel and the under-construction international airport.
“Police have arrested 18 HDT people who attacked the police complex and set the complex gate on fire and were insisting to block Gwadar port,” he said, explaining that the police had no other option but to stop the protesters from entering the port.
“Whoever will break or take the law into their own hands would be dealt with according to the law, even if Maulana is found involved in it,” the home minister warned.
If the Maulana wants negotiations, the government is ready for it, but it would not allow anyone to challenge the writ of the state, he said, recalling that the HDT leadership, instead of taking part in negotiations with the official team, sent four representatives in his place.
They were briefed about the progress on the issues such as putting an end to trawling and matters related to Iran, he said.
However, he said, the HDT representatives while talking to the deputy commissioner quoted the Maulana as saying, “I have taken my revenge by not attending the negotiations and now talks would be held next day.”
He said the government team waited for resumption of talks, but the other side did not move forward.
Referring to their demands, the minister said even Levies personnel were deployed to check illegal trawling in the Balochistan waters. The issues of Customs, Wapda or tax-free zones belong to the federal government, yet the provincial government offered to take up those issues with the centre by forming a joint committee, he said.
“If Maulana Hidayatur Rehman says why his non-custom paid vehicle was seized, then the government cannot do anything about it,” the minister said.
Asked about increasing terror attacks in the province, he said the terrorists who returned after the change of government in Afghanistan were carrying out the attacks in Balochistan, but the government was making all-out efforts to control the situation.

4,Russia accuses Ukraine of deadly air base attack,Claims it has killed a group of armed saboteurs from Ukraine that attempted to cross into the Bryansk region.,"MOSCOW: Moscow said on Monday it had foiled a new Ukrainian drone attack on a strategic bomber military base hundreds of kilometres from their joint border, as Kyiv called for Russia’s ouster from the United Nations. 
Russia said it had downed the drone at Engels, a base for the country’s strategic aircraft that Kyiv says have been used to strike Ukraine. 
Three servicemen were killed by falling debris, regional authorities said.  The same day, Russia’s domestic security agency said it killed four Ukrainian “saboteurs”, who allegedly attempted to enter Russia via a border region.
Moscow has accused pro-Kyiv forces of targeting Russian military sites and civilian infrastructure, including blowing up a bridge linking annexed Crimea to Russia. 
Russia’s defence ministry said on Monday it downed a Ukrainian drone at its Engels airfield in the southern Saratov region located more than 600km from the border with Ukraine.
It was the second attack on the Engels airfield in less than a month and the deepest strike into Russian territory since President Vladimir Putin sent troops to Ukraine on Feb 24. 
Russia’s FSB security service claimed it had killed a group of armed saboteurs from Ukraine that attempted to cross into the Bryansk region carrying “improvised explosive devices”. A video released by the FSB showed several bloodied bodies sprawled on the ground, wearing winter camouflage and carrying guns.  There was no immediate comment from Kyiv. 
The attacks came 10 months into Moscow’s offensive in Ukraine where Russian troops have been battering the country’s energy grid, leaving millions in the cold and dark in the middle of winter.  Ukraine on Monday urged the exclusion of Russia — a permanent member of the UN Security Council — from the world body.

5,Moscow willing to supply gas to Pakistan: deputy PM,MELBOURNE: Russia is ready to resume gas supplies to Europe through and it can also send supplies to Pakistan and...,"MELBOURNE: Russia is ready to resume gas supplies to Europe through and it can also send supplies to Pakistan and Afghanistan in the long term, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak told state TASS news agency.
“The European market remains relevant, as the gas shortage persists, and we have every opportunity to resume supplies,” TASS cited Mr Novak as saying.
“For example, the Yamal-Europe Pipeline, which was stopped for political reasons, remains unused,”
The Yamal-Europe Pipeline usually flows westward but has been mostly reversed since December of 2021 as Poland turned away from buying from Russia in favour of drawing on stored gas in Germany.
In May, Warsaw terminated its agreement with Russia, after earlier rejecting Moscow’s demand that it pays in roubles. Russian supplier Gazprom responded by cutting off supply and also said it would no longer be able to export gas via Poland after Moscow imposed sanctions against the firm that owns the Polish section of the Yamal-Europe pipeline. Mr Novak also reiterated that Moscow is discussing additional gas supplies through Turkey after the creation of a hub there.
He also said that Moscow expects it will have shipped 21 billion cubic metres (bcm) of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe in 2022.
“This year we were able to significantly increase LNG supplies to Europe,” Mr Novak said. “In the 11 months of 2022, they increased to 19.4 bcm, by the end of the year 21 bcm are expected.”
In a wide-ranging interview with the TASS agency, parts of which have been published throughout the weekend, Mr Novak also said that Russia has agreed with Azerbaijan to increase gas supplies for its domestic consumption.
“In the future, when they increase gas production, we will be able to discuss swaps,” he said.
Moscow is also discussing higher supplies of its gas to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, he said.

6,S. Korea fires at North’s drones after incursion,"SEOUL: South Korea accused the North of flying several drones across their shared border on Monday, prompting...","SEOUL: South Korea accused the North of flying several drones across their shared border on Monday, prompting Seoul’s military to deploy warplanes to shoot them down — with local media reporting one of the planes later crashed. 
The incursion was the first time in years that North Korean drones have invaded the South’s airspace and came hot on the heels of a recent flurry of sanctions-busting weapons tests by Pyongyang. 
The South’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said the military first detected a suspected North Korean unmanned aerial vehicle around the airspace of Gimpo at 10:25am (0125 GMT) and “responded immediately”. 
“This is a clear act of provocation in which North Korea invaded our airspace,” a JCS official told reporters. 
The incursion prompted Seoul to fire warning shots and deploy fighter jets and attack helicopters to shoot down the five drones, one of which reached airspace near the capital. One of the warplanes, a KA-1 light attack aircraft, later crashed in Hoengseong County, Yonhap news agency reported.
