D.I. KHAN / LAHORE: As the country reels from multiple incidents of terrorism, claimed by the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) over the past few days, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday vowed to eradicate militants across the country amid criticism by his predecessor Imran Khan, who grilled the government over a steep rise in militancy during its eight-month stint.
Addressing a gathering in Dera Ismail Khan, PM Shehbaz said that with the help of provincial governments and security forces, the government will eliminate terrorism in all its forms. He added that a meeting of the National Security Committee (NSC) would be summoned in a few days to take stock of the security situation.
The premier said the menace of terrorism was on the rise but the state would crush it very soon and no effort would be spared to prevent its return. 
In a comment on an attack on a security compound in Bannu last week, PM Shehbaz said the Bannu incident was heart-breaking and added that the law enforcement agencies conducted a successful operation, killing all terrorists who had taken over the compound. 
“We offer our condolences; the officers and personnel who were martyred in this incident are our heroes, their sacrifices will always be remembered,” he added.
‘Failure to rein in terror’
Meanwhile, former prime minister Imran Khan, who wants snap polls in the country at all costs and is likely to dissolve Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assemblies, lambasted the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government for its “failure” to rein in terrorism after coming to power in April this year. 
During a PTI meeting at Zaman Park, his residence in Lahore, Mr Khan claimed that his government had “controlled terrorism and was proudly leading the country towards making it one  of the world’s top tourism destinations”.
The PTI chairman appeared concerned over the situation at the Pak-Afghan border as well. He claimed that there was a 52 per cent increase in terror incidents since April and chided the government for the resurgence of terrorism. 
“At least 52 per cent increase has been recorded in terrorism cases across the country that claimed some 270 precious lives and left over 550 people injured,” the former premier claimed.
Separately, PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry told reporters that terrorism was returning to Pakistan. 
In our stint in the federal government, he said, the PTI was proudly projecting Pakistan as the world’s top tourist destination and major news channels like CNN and magazines were referring to this South Asian country as a world’s top tourist destination. 

 





 
Unfortunately, he said the nation was being pushed into the “fire of terrorism and the embassies were issuing advisories to their  employees to avoid five-star hotels” in Islamabad.
‘Economic crisis’ 
Speaking about the economic crisis plaguing the country, PM Sharif said the federal government was determined to steer the country out of the current difficulties.
The PM inaugurated multiple development projects, including 50-kilometre motorway section of CPEC’s western route from Yarik to Saggu, the rehabilitation of Chashma Right Bank Canal (CRBC), Tank Zam Dam, Chashma Hydel Power Project, and Gomal University’s Paharpur campus. He also inaugurated the repairing work from Pezu to Tank road, DI Khan bypass, and two 132 KV Grid stations for Abdul Khel and Band Kurai.

 





 
He said the plan for the western route of CPEC to Zhob was completed in 2017. But, the previous government of PTI had stopped this “important project”, he said, accusing it of destroying the national economy.
The premier also welcomed a suggestion put forth by Maulana Fazlur Rehman that an industrial estate should be established near the new airport. He added the ministry of industries and production would discuss the matter with the provincial departments and other stakeholders.
Film festival
Separately, PM Sharif formed a committee to discover youth talent in all fields. Addressing the National Amateur Short Film Festival in Islamabad, he said our youth should take a leading role in this purpose.
He directed the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to increase the number of scholarships from fifteen to fifty under the National Amateur Short Film Festival so more students could get an opportunity to attend foreign training.

1,Wazirabad suspect ‘failed polygraph’: Punjab govt,"""The investigation proved the attack was a well-thought-out conspiracy"", says Punjab CM's aide.","LAHORE: Lending credence to PTI Chairman Imran Khan’s claims that the assassination attempt on his life at Wazirabad was part of a ‘conspiracy’, the Punjab government on Monday said the lone attacker in police custody had failed a polygraph test, hinting at the possibility of more than one attacker.
Addressing a press conference, adviser to the Punjab chief minister on home affairs, Omar Sarfraz Cheema, claimed that more than one attacker attempted to assassinate the PTI chairman during the party’s long march in Wazirabad.
He added that a polygraph test revealed there was no truth in what the main suspect Naveed Arain was saying and the investigation proved the attack was a “well-thought-out conspiracy”.
“The investigations, currently underway, will reveal whose bullet hit Moazzam and took his life away,” he said.
Flanked by Adviser to CM retired Brig Musaddiq Haider, Mr Cheema said investigations revealed that Mr Arain was a trained assassin and present at the crime scene with his accomplices.
Mr Cheema, who also served as Punjab governor, clarified that Moazzam — the PTI worker who lost his life in the attack —  was not killed by Mr Khan’s security guards as their weapons were cleared in the forensic test.
Hinting at a possible conspiracy, the former governor said the PDM government had threatened the PTI to stop its long march and later, the incumbent government didn’t even condemn the attack on the PTI chief.
Mr Cheema claimed PML-N leaders fanned religious fanaticism and openly threatened Mr Khan and the long march participants, and even vowed to stop it.
After the attack, he said, the PML-N further intensified the propaganda instead of condemning the assassination attempt.
Mr Cheema said the Joint Investigation Team (JIT), constituted by the Punjab government on Nov 16, called PML-N leaders for statements, but none of them appeared.
He said PML-N leaders should appear before the JIT “for the sake of justice” and added that their warrants should be issued if they refuse to join the investigation.
He added all PTI leaders, including himself, who were present at the container, had appeared before the JIT.
He added that only Mr Khan and party leader Zubair Niazi didn’t appear before the JIT as the latter has filed a petition with the Lahore High Court against the FIR registered in the case.

2,"New Delhi deploying missiles on two borders, claims report",Reports say India has approved the purchase of 120 Pralay missiles to deploy them along its borders with Pakistan and China.,"NEW DELHI: India plans to deploy 120 tactical missiles on its uneasy borders with China and Pakistan, a news agency said on Monday. 
However, experts say the announcement is more likely a response to domestic opposition that has accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of being weak-kneed before alleged Chinese aggression. 
The government has refused to hold a debate on the issue in parliament.
A reminder in the report, which came across as a promo for the missile, was a giveaway. 
“However,” it said, “as of now, only two tests have been conducted using the Pralay ballistic missile. This could mean that the missile would not be operational for at least a couple of years since supporting mobile platforms will have to be developed for the ballistic missile”.
Reports said India has approved the purchase of 120 Pralay missiles to deploy them along the country’s borders with China and Pakistan.
“A high-level meeting of the Defence Ministry cleared the acquisition of around 120 missiles for the armed forces and their deployment along the borders,” a defence source was quoted by ANI news agency as saying. 
Pralay missiles are said to be able to hit targets at a distance of up to 500km and are difficult to intercept due to their ability to change their path. 
Developed domestically, Pralay is a canisterised tactical, surface-to-surface, short-range ballistic missile and has often been compared with the Russian Iskander missiles.
The missile, fired from a canister, followed the intended quasi-ballistic trajectory and made a highly accurate strike on the target, validating the control, guidance, and mission algorithms, reports said.
Even though reports suggest that Pralay is based on the Indian ballistic missile Prithvi, it has been likened more to the Iskander ballistic missiles of Russia that have been overwhelmingly deployed against Ukraine and have proved their combat prowess, the reports claim. 
The plan to acquire the Pralay missile by the Indian military is significant because it comes at a time when the Indian Defence Ministry’s top echelons have been discussing the development of a Rocket force for the Indian Army. 
According to reports, the Pralay missile will allow the Indian Army to target dual-use Chinese infrastructure and military bases on the Tibetan Plateau.

3,IHC seeks complete record of Toshakhana gifts,Law officer tells court details of gifts received prior to 1990s ‘may not exist’.,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court on Monday issued notices to the Cabinet Division and directed the federal government to provide details of Toshakhana gifts from the available record. 
Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb of the IHC heard the petition seeking details of Toshakhana gifts given to the successive presidents and prime ministers since 1947.
The petitioner, a lawyer by profession, informed the court that the Pakistan Information Commission (PIC) had ordered the government to provide Toshakhana details on June 29 this year, adding that the Cabinet Division did not comply with the PIC order.
He requested the court to order the Cabinet Division to provide details of Toshakhana gifts presented to the chief executives and heads of state, along with the market value of these gifts and the prices charged.

Law officer tells court details of gifts received prior to 1990s ‘may not exist’

Deputy Attorney General Syed Ahsan Raza Shah told the court that Toshakhana’s record prior to the 1990s might not exist.
The counsel for the petitioner said his client had sought details of the gifts given by other countries to the presidents and prime ministers, but the Cabinet Division had refused to provide the information claiming it to be classified.
Justice Aurangzeb asked the petitioner to explain the reason for confining details to the prime ministers and presidents and not seeking information about the gifts taken by public servants?
Justice Aurangzeb directed the federal government to provide information of the available record to the court and adjourned the hearing till next month.
In a separate case on the same issue, Justice Aurangzeb in April observed the government can release the details of Toshakhana gifts received by former prime minister Imran Khan as there is no restraining order to withhold the information.
The judge had remarked that the government reciprocates the gesture of receiving gifts from foreign heads of states. He added the government should formulate a policy on Toshakhana gifts since they were gifted to state functionaries and who should not be able to claim such gifts after paying a nominal amount.
The previous case was filed by petitioner Abrar Kha­lid who had sought details about gifts received by former PM Khan from the PIC. The Cabinet Division had opposed the request, pleading before the PIC that this matter did not fall within the ambit of Right of Access to Information Act, 2017.
While referring to a letter dated April 4, 1993 that had declared the details of Toshakhana “classified/secret”, it argued the information could not be requisitioned under the Access to Information Act.
Later, the Cabinet Division filed a petition in the IHC claiming the PIC order was “illegal”. The then PTI government had adopted the stance that the dis­closure of any information rela­ted to Toshakhana could jeopardise foreign relations.
Hearing a similar case, earlier this month, the Lahore High Court (LHC) also directed the federal government to submit complete details of the Toshakhana gifts received by political rulers and bureaucrats from foreign dignitaries since the creation of Pakistan.
The LHC’s directives came after a federal law officer, while representing the Centre, argued the record of Toshakhana articles was classified in nature and could not be made public.
However, the judge observed that the details were classified only  when a buyer or retainer of Toshakhana items was supposed to declare his  purchases in the annual tax returns.

4,NA speaker’s partiality an ‘insult to parliament’: PTI,Party decides to come up with White Paper on ‘failing economy’.,"• Strategy for Elahi’s vote of confidence discussed in Zaman Park huddle  • Party decides to come up with White Paper on ‘failing economy’
LAHORE: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on Monday condemned the National Assembly speaker’s decision to head abroad on a tour soon after the party decided that its legislators would appear before him to pressurise him for acceptance of its MNAs’ resignations. 
The senior PTI leadership termed the speaker’s “partiality towards the government an insult to the parliament” at a party meeting held at the residence of ex-premier Imran Khan, where former finance minister Shaukat Tarin gave a briefing about the soaring prices. 
The meeting, which reviewed economic recession that they said had rendered thousands of people jobless, making it difficult for them to make ends meet, also decided to issue a White Paper on the economy.
Mr Khan’s plan for the dissolution of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assemblies also came under discussion at the meeting.
PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry told the media the party had created different working groups on governance.
About its strategy for vote of confidence, the senior leader said the PTI and its ally PML-Q would hold Punjab parliamentary parties’ meeting. All 187 MPAs, including 10 belonging to the PML-Q, would attend the meeting, he added. 
The ruling alliance would take vote of confidence for the chief minister Parvez Elahi – much before Jan 11 – a date fixed by the Lahore High Court to take up the case pertaining to governor’s order.
He said some PML-N MPAs were also contacting the PTI and “wanted to be adjusted”. “Such politicians will be adjusted in the constituencies, where the PTI and PML-Q won’t have candidates,” he said, adding that next general elections were round the corner.
About the meeting at Zaman Park, the ex-minister said it was informed that the country would default if the PDM government failed to get its IMF programme extended and the masses would face serious impact of price hike.
“If the government will accept the IMF conditions, even then there will be a storm of price hike that will push the masses against the wall,” he remarked. 
The PTI leader said it was high time the judiciary, army and other state institutions analysed the country’s situation and compelled the incumbent coalition government to announce general elections to allow a public-mandated government to put the economy on track. 
The party decided also looked into the impact of shattering economy on country’s sovereignty, defence and security. 
The meeting, which was chaired by Mr Khan, deliberated upon the decisions of incumbent Pakistan Democratic Movement government and its impact on rupee, industry and purchasing power of the masses, before arriving at the conclusion that the coalition government was pushing the country towards default. 
Ex-PM Khan told participants in the meeting the PDM government’s corrupt, dishonest and incompetent group was given a ‘clean-chit through NRO-II’ and they eventually ruined the economy. He said he had been raising this issue since the day his government had been toppled through the regime change ‘conspiracy’. 
After economic disaster, Mr Khan said the imported government was also failing on the internal security front. The nation had been asking about those pushing the country towards internal conflicts, he said. 
“It is a foolish act to leave country’s foreign policy and national security in the hands of ‘immature’ son of Asif Zardari,” he said in a reference to the foreign minister.

5,Establishment also tried to cut a deal with PML-N: Asif,"The establishment tried their best to cut a deal with the PML-N ahead of 2018 polls, but Nawaz Sharif did not agree, claims Asif.","LAHORE: Defence Minister Khawaja Asif claimed on Monday that the establishment had tried to cut a deal with the PML-N before the 2018 elections on ‘certain matters’, but Nawaz Sharif did not agree and as a result Imran Khan was brought to power.  
“The ‘Imran model’ was kept in a laboratory. They (establishment) tried their best to cut a deal with the then PML-N government on certain matters ahead of the 2018 vote, but Nawaz Sharif did not agree. Had Nawaz said yes, there would have been no Panama case and judicial verdicts against him (Nawaz),” Mr Asif said while addressing a seminar here on Monday.  
The minister also indirectly talked about the establishment’s offer to Shehbaz Sharif of becoming prime minister. 
“Shehbaz Sharif stood with his elder brother and did not leave him and his party (by rejecting the establishment’s offer). Had he (Shehbaz) compromised, there was a possibility that this (Imran) model would not have been tried in 2018. But perhaps the honour which we earned today might not have been there (in case of accepting the offer),” he said.  
Former interior minister Chaudhry Nisar, who was very close to Nawaz Sharif till his ouster by the apex court in 2017 in the Panama Papers case, had ‘categorically cautioned’ him not to pick up fights with the powerful military establishment over certain matters. 
The relationship between the two friends turned sour as Mr Sharif reportedly followed the advice of the party hardliners like his daughter Maryam Nawaz and old confidant Pervaiz Rashid.  
Khawaja Asif further said Imran Khan had lied that the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) was under the control of Gen Qamar Bajwa and he was helpless. 



 
“The whole PML-N leadership was jailed at the behest of Imran Khan and this decision was taken by Mr Khan and not Bajwa,” he said.  
The minister said the establishment would have now tasted the outcome of its (Imran model) experiment. “Those who brought this man (Imran) to power have realised now their mistake. He (Imran) is hurling abuses at his benefactors. They (establishment) too would have realised their worth,” he commented and added Imran Khan was not sincere with anyone... be it his country, family or supporters.  
The minister made it clear that the federal coalition would not go into early polls come what may. 
“I was in favour of calling fresh elections soon after the ouster of Imran Khan through a vote of no-confidence. But since we have lost our political capital during the last eight months, therefore, there is no question of going into snap elections. We will try to regain our political capital and the elections will be held on time. We will not be blackmailed on this matter let me make it clear,” he declared.  
Mr Asif said he would forward a recommendation to his party leadership regarding acceptance of resignations of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf MNAs. 
“The PTI MNAs resignations should be accepted and elections be held on the vacant seats and this should go on till the tenure of our government is completed,” he said and dared Imran Khan to dissolve the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly where he had no issue like Punjab.  
The minister said the elite including politicians, establishment, judiciary, bureaucracy and media were responsible for the current situation of the country. “All of them will have to sit together to find a solution to the problems the country is facing today,” he suggested.  
About ‘temporary’ disappearance of PTI leader Shahbaz Gill from Lahore’s hospital where he had been under treatment, 
Mr Asif said: “When Shehbaz Gill came to know that the chief minister had been de-notified by the governor he left the hospital only to return after his (CM) restoration by the court.”
