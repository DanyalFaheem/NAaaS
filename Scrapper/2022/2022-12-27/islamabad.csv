0,Ch Nisar will be ‘uninvited’ guest in PTI: Sarwar Khan,Says political inning of PML-N leader is over.,"TAXILA: Former federal minister and PTI central leader Ghulam Sarwar Khan has said the political inning of PML-N leader Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan was over and if he joined the PTI he would be an “uninvited” guest in the party.
He was talking to newsmen at the PTI secretariat on Monday. Member National Assembly Mansoor Hayat Khan and Member Punjab Assembly Ammar Sadeeq Khan were also present.
Commenting on the recent statement of the estranged PML-N leader Chaudhry Nisar that he may join the PTI ahead of the next general elections, Sarwar Khan made it clear that there was no room for Mr Nisar in the party.
Sarwar Khan is the political arch-rival of Chaudhry Nisar. The veteran politician contested the 2018 general elections as an independent candidate with the election symbol of “jeep” after developing differences with the party leadership.
He lost the National Assembly seat to Sarwar Khan but managed to win a Punjab Assembly seat from his hometown of Chakri.
After the four years of long hiatus, Chaudhry Nisar resurfaced on political arena and unveiled his strategy while addressing the party workers recently.
The two arch-rivals have a history of defeating each other from the same constituency. In the 1990 elections, for the first time IJI’s Chaudhry Nisar faced Sarwar Khan of the People’s Democratic Alliance (PDA). Chaudhry Nisar repeated the history in the 1993 elections when he defeated Sarwar Khan. During the elections 2008, Chaudhry Nisar as PML-N candidate defeated Sarwar Khan who contested the elections from the platform of PML-Q. In the 2002 elections, Sarwar Khan appeared as an independent candidate and managed to defeat Chaudhry Nisar. In the 2018 elections, Sarwar Khan again defeated Chaudhry Nisar and stopped his entry into the National Assembly.
Sarwar Khan while responding to a question said he does not foresee any political role of Chaudhry Nisar in national politics as no party, either PML-N or PTI, would issue him a ticket.
Responding to another question about launching his son by Chaudhry Nisar, Mr Sarwar claimed that his group does not see any political threat from him on his national as well as provincial assembly constituencies as he is strong enough to play against politically immature candidates.
Answering a question about the political hiccups in Punjab, he predicted that Punjab Assembly was inching towards dissolution followed by KP Assembly and subsequently no option would be left but to conduct general elections before time.

1,17pc local government seats for capital women remain uncontested,"PTI fields more candidates than PPP, PML-N and JUI-F combined.","ISLAMABAD: About 17 per cent of seats reserved for women nominees in the Islamabad local government elections have remained uncontested, as none of the political parties were able to field candidates on these seats, according to a report.
Pattan said in its analysis that 99 of the total 101 Forms (VII) of the contesting candidates disclosed that there were no women candidates for at least 17 per cent of the total seats. If polls are held on schedule on Dec 31 then at least one-fifth of the reserved seats will remain vacant.
“It could be attributed to the failure of political parties, women groups, and civil society,” the report said, adding that as many as 434 women were contesting elections on 202 seats reserved for them i.e. two each in all union councils. As opposed to 17 per cent, in the 2005 LG elections, less than 1 per cent of women’s seats had remained vacant.
The report said that out of 434 women nominees, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) fielded the highest number (32 per cent) of candidates followed by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz’s (PML-N) 25 per cent share. PPP nominated 11 candidates, it added.

PTI fields more candidates than PPP, PML-N and JUI-F combined

About seats reserved for minorities, it said the PTI and PML-N fielded the same number of nominees whereas the Jamaat-i-Islami and PPP nominated 12 and six candidates, respectively. Overall, 55 (56%) reserved seats for minorities have remained vacant.
According to nomination forms submitted for chairmen and vice chairmen slots, PML-N, PPP, and JUI-F had the largest share (27%) of candidates, followed by independent candidates (25%), and PTI at 24%. However, overall PTI fielded the most candidates as out of 3,472 candidates, PTI fielded 1,019 while PML-N nominated 845 candidates.
Similarly, there appears a strong relationship between power and contestation rate. For instance, the seat-to-candidate ratio for chairmen and vice chairmen appears to be 1 to 4, while for the seats of peasant/worker and youth, it was 2.98, and 2.94 respectively. Overall, for all the categories of seats, the seat-to-candidate ratio was as low as 2.70. According to Pattan, as many as 85% of the candidates contesting elections on seats reserved for workers and peasants were neither workers nor peasants.
The report said PTI apparently had “deeper roots in rural as well as urban union councils of Islamabad” as the party has fielded more candidates than the combined candidates of PPP, PML-N, and JUI-F.
Perhaps due to prevailing political uncertainty, electioneering appeared to be lacklustre in most of the union councils. About the recent amendments to the Local Government Act 2015, it observed these changes have further alienated the candidates from the election campaign. Most candidates appeared to be extremely resentful of the last-minute changes to the local government law by the ruling coalition. In their view, “it had cost a huge loss to their finances and precious time”.
The report urged the political parties to establish party chapters at the local level. It also said women groups, labour movement, and civil society should play their due role to make sure marginalised social classes could contest elections and protect their representation and power.
“Quality of candidates ensures the quality of elections and that leads to good governance. To achieve this goal, the Election Commission needs to improve its capacities to assess and scrutinise nomination papers rigorously,” it said.
It said holding local elections on regular basis in all situations must be made mandatory and added that effective and powerful local government was a prerequisite to making communities resilient to disasters.

2,Investigators suspect suicide bomber came from KP,"Suspect’s presence was spotted at Pirwadhai bus terminal and later at I-10/4 through geo-fencing, say sources.","ISLAMABAD: Investigators of last Friday’s bomb blast in the capital have suspected that the terrorist had reached the capital the same day in a passenger vehicle from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP).
Sources close to the investigation said the investigators had detected the presence of a person at Karak, Pirwadhai and I-10/4 the same day and suspected that he might be the bomber.
The suspect’s presence was spotted at Pirwadhai bus terminal and later at I-10/4 through geo-fencing. 
The investigators also found that his presence at the Pirwadhai bus terminal had coincided with the arrival of a passenger vehicle from Karak there.
So far, no evidence has been found either he met someone at the bus terminal or not, the sources said. 
There is a possibility that he had travelled with a ready-to-blow suicide jacket and a detonator.
The man also made a call and talked to someone on his mobile phone after reaching Pirwadhai, they said.
Investigation conducted so far also showed that either he was wearing the jacket or holding it when it was detonated, as nothing was left or found intact on his body.
Along with other human parts, some fingers, intestine and a bone were found from the crime scene and it was believed that these belonged to the terrorist. A DNA test was being conducted to identify the human remains.
Meanwhile, security around hotels housing foreign visitors was further tightened, police officers said, adding deployment of police and paramilitary troops had also been made around them.
Besides, temporary bunkers were made and pickets set up on roads near the hotels. Policemen were also conducting physical checking of individuals and vehicles.
Issuance of security alerts and advisory by foreign missions in the capital to their countryman continued, keeping in view the situation arising out of Friday’s terror incident and a threat alert issued by the local authorities.
Security staff of some western, European and Middle Eastern countries met relevant officers, including senior police officers concerned, to get an update on the situation, the officers said.

3,Bid to hire 150 buses for new routes in Islamabad cancelled,"Decision made to call bids afresh after objection by one of two firms, say officials","ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) has cancelled the bid to hire 150 buses for 13 new routes and decided to call it afresh.
The CDA on Monday cancelled the highest bid as there was an objection raised by the second company which had participated in the bidding process.
The civic agency decided to call the bid afresh after making changes to the advertisement. CDA officials told Dawn that a few months ago bids were called for awarding the contract for plying 150 buses on 13 routes.
The officials said the civic agency, in the advertisement, had stated that the firms could submit bids either for diesel hybrid or electronic vehicle (EV) buses.

Decision made to call bids afresh after objection by one of two firms, say officials

In response to the advertisement, only two firms - Daewoo and Faisal Mover - submitted their bids and the bid of Faisal Mover (FM) turned out to be the lowest.  They said FM deposited the bid with Rs321 per kilometre fare for diesel hybrid and Daewoo at Rs366 per kilometre fare for EV buses.
According to officials, there was a difference between the rate of hybrid and EV buses but FM applied for hybrid buses and its rate was lower and Daewoo submitted the bid for EV and its rate was higher, but the category was different.
When the bids were opened, FM was declared the lowest bidder, however, Daewoo pleaded before the CDA that since there was an option in ad that participating companies can apply for hybrid or EV modes; therefore, it had applied for EV and quoted the rate for it, which were obviously higher than that of FM, but the category was different.  It also pleaded that the rate of EV and hybrid can’t match with each other.
The officials said due to the objection, the CDA earlier had decided to form a grievance redressal committee (GRC) to decide the fate of the bid. When the matter was brought into the notice of CDA Chairman Mohammad Usman, he ordered cancellation of the bid to avoid any controversy and litigation.  He also directed the engineering wing to call bids afresh as soon as possible.
On the directives of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the CDA had decided to launch new bus services on 13 routes. Earlier, the prime minister had inaugurated three metro bus services - Orange Line, Green Line and Blue Line. The buses that are plying on the three routes belong to the CDA.
However, under the new arrangement for plying buses on 13 routes, the CDA has decided that instead of procuring buses, it will hire services of a private bus company, which will ply 150 buses. The firm would be paid against per kilometre of travel.
According to a study, the 13 routes included that one from Police Foundation/Orange Line Station to Red Line Faiz Ahmed Faiz Station at I-8, Allama Iqbal Station to Red Line Potohar Station, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) to Secretariat, D-12 to G-10, F-11 to Red Line F-8 Station, G-11 to Pims, Aabpara to Tramri Chowk, Nilor to Khanna Pul, Pirwadhai Chowk to Faizabad, B-17 to 26 Number Chungi and I-16 to 26 Number.

The delegation was given a detailed briefing by the ECP Special Secretary Zafar Iqbal Husain and his team.
It was explained that the constitutional mandate of the ECP was to hold elections for the federal and provincial parliaments, and also the local governments.
The mechanisms, finances, and equalization and inclusion policies were also shared with the delegates. Somali delegation took great interest in the election mechanism, and how women and other disadvantaged groups are facilitated and what were the challenges.
They were told that NADRA civil registry plays a vital role and special drives are being conducted to register people under civil registry and this helps people be included in the one of the most trusted electoral rolls.
“Election Rules 2017 give clear mandate to recall an election if women voters are less than 10%, and ECP enforces it if needed,” added Ms Nighat Iqbal while responding to the query.
Somali delegates asked about the dispute resolution mechanisms in the election system. They were told that judiciary plays a central role and election tribunals are established to address issues related to any malpractice or dispute.
In addition, Election Commission tries to keep the system as transparent and as independent as possible to avoid situations of conflict. In the end, the Special Secretary Election Commission presented the shield of honor to the leader of visiting study tour Mr. Ahmed Moallim Fiqi.
Mohsin Dawar, independent MNA from North Waziristan, talked about colonial apparatus in the FATA area and how it was not taken as normal province or a federating unit. He mentioned that this area has become a laboratory for many activities including terrorism.
He talked about the issues associated with majoritarian representation models, and how those systems can be and must be addressed. “The Senate of Pakistan was established to bring in parity in representation, but it was given a more ceremonial status with less powers to influence policies in the country”, he added.
Responding to the questions about terrorism which is menacing both Pakistan and Somalia, Mr Dawar said that techniques and reasons of terrorism may be different but objectives appear to be quite similar. So, there is a need to develop coherent strategy to address these questions.
He emphasized the importance of “trust” between the state and society and absence of which gives space to the terrorist operate and build popular support. Mr. Dawar informed the participants about special briefing by the foreign office, and he has requested the foreign office to organize more such briefings for the parliamentarians and the foreign minister also be there.

A spokesman for the traffic police said on Monday that Chief Traffic Officer Taimoor Khan had issued orders to all circle and sector in-charges to take strict action against those plying vehicles without registration plates, using non-sample registration plates (government approved) and fake registration numbers.
He said the decision to launch a crackdown against ‘fake’ registration plates was taken in view of the prevailing security situation and for the safety of the people’s lives and property.
Though several auto-rickshaws and loader vehicles have been plying in the city areas without registration plates, the city traffic police have been unable to check them.
The CTO said that in order to ensure security and peace, checking will be tightened at all the entry and exit points of the city.
“Those violating the law will not be issued a challan, but rather an FIR will be registered against them while vehicles and motorcycles without number plates and found using non-specimen plates will be impounded until the Excise and Taxation Department issued them the model number plates,” said the CTO.
He also appealed to the citizens to use computerised number plates to avoid legal action and get their vehicles registered on time.

7,ECP urged to ensure inclusive elections,"Polling stations must be made accessible for PWDs, elderly persons","ISLAMABAD: The Coalition for Elections and Democracy (CED), a group of civil society organisations, working to strengthen democratic and electoral processes in Pakistan has called on the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to take urgent action to ensure inclusive elections.
It has been highlighted that the upcoming 2023 general election and local government elections in the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) and provinces are fully accessible to all voters, including those with disabilities, elderly individuals, and those with health issues.
The CED highlighted that despite the ECP’s efforts to make polling stations more accessible and its establishment of a Gender and Disability Electoral Working Group, it is likely that many persons with disabilities (PWDs) would still face significant attitudinal and physical barriers to casting their votes.
Through a letter written to the Chief Election Commissioner, Mukhtar Ahmed Ali, executive director of Centre for Peace and Development Initiatives (CPDI) and national coordinator of CED has made several recommendations to the ECP for making the upcoming election inclusive for all voters.

Polling stations must be made accessible for PWDs, elderly persons

One of the recommendations for the ECP is to develop and publish the Draft Polling Scheme for the 2023 general election as soon as possible, allowing enough time for objections and complaints to be raised and addressed. This would provide political parties, candidates, civil society and voters with the opportunity to raise any objections, including from the accessibility standpoint, and allow the ECP to address any reasonable and legitimate complaints.
The CED has also recommended that the ECP must conduct an accessibility audit of potential polling stations, preferably through a development partner, to provide authentic information on the barriers faced by PWDs and other marginalised groups. This would help the ECP to better understand the problem and take timely remedial measures.
CED has also called upon the ECP to strengthen its coordination with district authorities, including the education department and the local governments concerned, to ensure that all polling stations in the future will be located on ground floors and will be accessible through ramps.
In this regard, the ECP may convene meetings of relevant officials, including chief secretaries, finance secretaries, and education secretaries of the provinces, to discuss the urgent need for accessible polling stations and impress upon the need for timely remedial measures.
ECP must also issue directions to relevant authorities to review building codes from an accessibility perspective and ensure compliance with accessibility requirements, including those prescribed through the Accessibility Code of Pakistan, 2006.
In its letter, the CED has noted that the local government election in the ICT is fast approaching, and it is crucial that all voters, including PWDs, are able to participate in the electoral process on an equal and dignified basis. 
“CED requests the ECP to take swift action to consider these recommendations and ensure that all citizens have a fair and equal opportunity to have their voices heard,” it added.
The CED is a civil society coalition for voter education, election observation and strengthening democratic institutions. Its secretariat is based at CPDI.

8,Gas connections of consumers using compressors removed,"ISLAMABAD: Special Task Force of Sui Northern Gas Pipelines (SNGPL), during its ongoing operation to stop illegal ...","ISLAMABAD: Special Task Force of Sui Northern Gas Pipelines (SNGPL), during its ongoing operation to stop illegal use of compressors in the Islamabad region, has removed more than 27 gas meters, detected 18theft cases and lodged six FIRs over direct tapping and causing loss to the national exchequer.
Sharing some details, spokesman for the SNGPL Islamabad Region Shahid Akram told this agency that the inspection teams had recently disconnected 27 gas meters on use of compressors in different localities including Tarlai, Chatta Bakhtawar, G-7and G-9 sectors and Kallar Syedan.
It is unfortunate that some elements are using electric devices to get increased gas pressure, depriving other consumers of gas in the peak winter season and putting people’s lives at risk, he regretted, vowing that the operation would continue unabated till bringing the illegal activity to a complete end.
He said the SNGPL vigilance teams and special task force were busy conducting a detailed survey of all sectors, societies and other localities, within the Islamabad region including capital territory, Murree, Kahuta , Attock, Fatehjang and Taxila to take legal action against compressor users.
Shahid Akram said the SNGPL teams were conducting raids in collaboration with FIA and local police personnel, adding the company would publish the names of consumers involved in the installation of illegal compressors and the gas pilferers in national dailies to prevent illegal activities and save the precious and scarce gas.
The SNGPL spokesman said domestic consumers had appreciated the operation against this illegal activity and urged the local administration to take appropriate measures for preventing the sale of illegal compressors and other devices used to increase the gas pressure.
Replying to a question, he said the company was making all out efforts to ensure the provision of gas supply to domestic consumers with regular pressure during the peak winter season.
For this purpose, the SNGPL has established a control room to resolve consumers’ complaints related to low gas pressure in its operational areas. The control room is operating round-the-clock and taking prompt action by mobilizing field teams to resolve the gas-pressure-related issues. Consumers can lodge their complaints at the Call Center at 1199 and Control Rooms landlines number 051-9257774.
He feared there could be gas pressure issues in the remote areas and tail-end of the gas distribution system of the Islamabad region due to changing weather patterns.
The spokesman advised the consumers to avoid excessive use of gas and install fuel-efficient gas appliances like geysers and heaters in the peak winter season. He asked the consumers to adopt all possible precautionary measures to avoid any untoward incident caused by gas leakages by discouraging rubber-pipe use with gas appliances and keeping the room windows open.
The company has also started a service to provide Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders for its consumers, which can be obtained by calling on Helpline-1210 or sending a WhatsApp message at 0333-7641199. /395-

The list displayed by University of Health Sciences (UHS) for admissions in 2022-23 showed that last merit of King Edward Medical University was 93.56pc while that of RMU is 93.26pc, so, the difference between the two universities is of 0.3 points only.
In 2021 and 2022, RMU was ranked first among medical universities of Pakistan by the Impact Times Higher Education (THE). THE is an international agency which gives ranking to universities. RMU was established in 2017 and in a period of five years it has become the fastest growing university of Pakistan.
RMU Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Mohammad Umar told Dawn that this has happened for the first time in history that merit of RMU was raised from sixth to second position in the merit list for admissions in MBBS.
He said the reason for this fast growth is that RMU was the only public sector university in Punjab which adopted Clinically Oriented Integrated Modular System (IMS) of teaching since 2018.
“This is the modern system of teaching, training, and assessment in the first world. This system is in accordance with the World Federation of Medical Education (WFME) standards. 
“Recently, WFME stressed upon Pakistan Medical and Dental Council to preferably adopt IMS for Pakistan,” he said.
Secondly, he said that the RMU curriculum is research oriented, well structured and aligned with United States Medical Licencing Examination (USMLE) and Education Commission for foreign medical graduates (ECFMG).
“Research and medical ethics are taught to students from first year to final year. Both these sections are assessed in the examination also. Students publish their research in their own journal. The official journal is called the Students’ Journal of Rawalpindi Medical University. Students are also taught clinical integration from first year,” he said.
Prof Umar also elaborated that there are special workshops for the faculty members of RMU for their training to teach the modern curriculum according to modern teaching strategies like large group discussion (LGD), small group discussion (SGD), problem-based learning (PBL), self directed learning (SDL) and learning management system (LMS).
“Students are provided with online education sources and online assessments are also done while 30pc marks of continuous internal assessment are an integral part of their final examination mark sheet,” he said.
Along with high teaching standards, he said that RMU has renovated its hostels and playground. “This had a great impact on the extracurricular activities in RMU, which is also equipped with Pakistan Education Research Network (PERN) for students and faculty.
“Students and faculty use the latest learning and teaching facilities like digital libraries and research journal. RMU is the only public sector medical university in Punjab which is running a master’s programme in Professional Health Education (MHPE) to train the faculty for modern teaching strategies,” he said.
Prof Umar expressed hope that RMU would be the top medical university of Punjab next year in terms of admissions.
