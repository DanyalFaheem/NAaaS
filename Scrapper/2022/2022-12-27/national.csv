In a security alert, Saudi Arabia’s embassy advised incoming Saudi residents and those in Pakistan to remain “careful and limit their movement” amid the rising terror threat. They have been asked to “be cautious” and not venture out except for any necessity. “Security of Islamabad has been placed at the highest level,” the alert said, adding that Saudis should contact the embassy and consulate if the need arises. 
Also, the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) advised against all travel to Peshawar and various districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, on section of the N35 (or Karakoram Highway) between the Mansehra ring road and the N15/N35 Chilas interchange, N45 Road from the north of the Mardan ring-road to the edge of the district of Chitral, within 10 miles of the Line of Control and Balochistan province, excluding its southern coast.
Similarly, Australia also shared a travel advice, asking citizens not to travel to Balochistan and KP, except Chitral, due to poor security situation and high risk of kidnapping. Its citizens have also been advised against travelling to border areas with Afghanistan and India (excluding Lahore, Wag­ah, Kasur, Narowal and Sialkot) due to the volatile security situation.
The advisory also suggested potential travellers to Pakistan “reconsider” their decision due to the “volatile security situation and high threat of terrorist attack, kidnapping and violence”.

1,"Swati objects to being shifted to Balochistan, Sindh police custody","In letter to IHC chief justice, senator also criticises transfer of judge; alleges he was ‘abducted’ from Pims.","ISLAMABAD: In an unexpected move, PTI Senator Azam Khan Swati on Monday wrote to Islamabad High Court (IHC) Chief Justice Aamer Farooq while the latter was hearing his post-arrest bail plea. 
In the letter, Mr Swati criticised the IHC over his handing over to the Balochistan and Sindh Police where he is facing 46 FIRs. He also criticised the transfer of trial court judge where his bail plea was pending. 
The FIA last month arrested Mr Swati for defamation, a statement conducing to public mischief, and a campaign of intimidating tweets after his fiery speech at the PTI’s long march in Rawalpindi in which he lashed out at the military leadership. 
The FIA’s Cyber Crime Wing arrested him under Section 20 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) and Section 109 (abetment), 131 (mutiny), 500 (defamation) and 505 (conducing to public mischief) of Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). 

In letter to IHC chief justice, senator also criticises transfer of judge; alleges he was ‘abducted’ from Pims

Mr Swati’s letter was addressed to the chief justice, but it was not delivered to the IHC till late in the evening. 
In the communication, Senator Swati said that due to an order of the IHC chief justice he was “abducted” and illegally taken from the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences Hospital (Pims) on Dec 2 — where he was under treatment — to Quetta and then Sindh where 46 “false” FIRs were registered against him. 
He claimed that the judge of the FIA’s special court, Additional District and Sessions Judge Raja Asif Meh­m­ood, was transferred after he reserved judgement on his bail petition. 
As per the record, the high court’s administration issued the transfer order of Judge Asif on Nov 21, while Mr Swati was arrested on Nov 28 a week after the IHC had nominated District and Sessions Judge Azam Khan as presiding officer of the FIA’s court.
Mr Swati stated that his lawyer had presented a judgement before ADSJ Raja Asif about the registration of FIRs after which he reserved the decision, but he was transferred before the announcement of his ruling. 
According to the said judgement, Justice Babar Sattar quashed the FIR registered against a citizen over an anti-army tweet. However, in this particular case, the suspect (Mr Swati) has dissociated himself from the Twitter handle where the controversial tweet had been uploaded. 
Mr Swati’s counsel, Babar Awan, suggested that his client’s case is identical to the case decided by Justice Sattar and therefore his case might be placed before the same bench. 
However, since Justice Sattar is on leave and Mr Swati’s another petition was disposed of by Chief Justice Farooq, the registrar fixed this case before the CJ. 
While seeking their reply to Mr Swati’s plea through notices to FIA and the state, Justice Farooq adjourned the case to Jan 2. 
In his bail plea, Mr Swati dissociated himself from the controversial tweets and said he never tried to defame any institution. The PTI leader said he was falsely implicated in the case due to “political influences of hostile regime”. 
According to the petition, after the registration of FIR, he was incarcerated in physical remand by the FIA before being handed over to the Balochistan Police. 
It said that after the Balochistan High Court and the Sindh High Court had ordered quashing the FIRs against him, he approached the special court of FIA for post-arrest bail. However, he said, the judge dismissed the bail plea. 
In the petition, Mr Swati states that he is 75 years old and suffering from heart disease and is on medication. 
The court was told that “entire case against the petition[er] is consisting of documented allegation, therefore, [there is] no useful purpose of keeping him [in the] judicial custody, which shall tantamount, in fact, [to] punishment in advance to the petitioner in the offences of which the trial is yet to commence”.

Dr Alvi denies saying ex-COAS helped PTI, Imran

He called the father of Havaldar Parosh Khan, who was martyred in North Waziristan on Nov 30. 
Refutes news reports
In another development, President Alvi rebutted a statement attributed to him regarding the alleged support exten­ded by former army chief Ge­­neral Qamar Javed Bajwa to Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf during the 2018 general elections.
A statement released by the Presidency said “President Dr Arif Alvi has taken notice of the statement wrongly attributed to him about the alleged help extended by the former Chief of Army Staff, General (r) Qamar Javed Bajwa, and his team in the Senate, and their help to Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) during the elections.”
The statement posted on the Presidency’s official Twitter account claimed the remarks were quoted out of context, “twisted and self-concocted”.
The rebuttal came after several media outlets reported that President Alvi, in an informal meeting, accepted that the PTI was helped by the army in the 2018 general elections and Senate polls.
According to The News, the president made these remarks during a conversation with journalists, business leaders and foreign diplomats over dinner on Saturday.
When asked why the relationship between former prime minister Imran Khan and the ex-COAS soured, the president replied that he was still looking for an answer, The News reported.
However, he added the dip probably came around October 2021 and then April or May 2022, The News reported.
President Alvi also said Gen Bajwa and his team had helped Mr Khan in the Senate, and they did help the PTI during the elections, The News added.

3,IHC gives govt one week to name NTDC chief,ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) asked the federal government on Monday to fill the vacant post of managing...,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) asked the federal government on Monday to fill the vacant post of managing director at the National Transmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC) within a week. 
The court warned that if the government did not comply with the order, the appointment of officers as caretaker managing director (MD) and deputy MD would stand  suspended. 
Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani passed the directive during the hearing of a petition filed by Safdar Ali, Senior General Manager at the NTDC. 
He named the federal government, acting NTDC MD Rana Abdul Jabbar and Deputy MD Manzoor Ahmed as respondents. 
The IHC reminded the respondents that the assistant attorney general (AAG) had informed it on Oct 20 that the NTDC board had already recommended three names to the federal government for appointment as managing director at the company. 
According to the respondents, the AAG needs more time as the federal government has yet to give the final approval to one of the names recommended to it for appointment as managing director. 
On the other hand, counsel for the petitioner,  Mohammad Shuaib Shaheen, contended that the NTDC and the ministry of energy (power division) were violating the IHC order persistently by giving caretaker charge of managing director to Dr Rana Abdul Jabbar, general manager, instead of filling the vacancy.  
The court observed: “Prima facie, disclose the highhandedness on the part of the federal government who were not managing the affairs according to rules and law on the subject, though it has clearly been settled by the superior courts that the caretaker appointment is only meant for day-to-day affairs for a short period of time and could not be stretched on months. 
“Therefore, as per the undertaking of the Law Officer, seven days’ time is granted for appointment of Managing Director, NTDC, to the federal government. However, if no meeting is convened till the next date of hearing, the notification dated July 7, 2022, for appointment of Dr Rana Abdul Jabbar as Managing Director of NTDC, as well as the notification dated March 29 for appointment of Manzoor Ahmed, as deputy managing director on contract basis shall stand suspended till the appointment of regular incumbent.”

4,High court asks Peshawar university to pay pension,Declares that pension payment is necessary for the well-being and peace of mind of the retirees as well as it is their right.,"PESHAWAR: Accepting the plea of over 260 former employees of the Islamia College Peshawar, the Peshawar High Court has ordered the University of Peshawar to immediately release their pension withheld since August this year.
A bench consisting of Justice Lal Jan Khattak and Justice Sahibzada Asadullah ordered the respondents, including the UoP, to make all due pension payments to the petitioners forthwith until any decision was taken by a committee constituted by the higher education department to determine their status.
It declared that as pension payment was necessary for the well-being and peace of mind of the retirees as well as it was their right, their petition was accepted by the court.
The petition was jointly filed by former ICP associate professor Sher Haider and 260 other pensioners.
The UoP has stopped the payment of pension to the petitioners insisting that after the establishment of the ICUP, the ICP was no longer its constituent college and therefore, the pension for petitioners should be released by the ICUP.
The counsel for petitioners, Nazeer Ahmad, said his clients were pensioners of the UoP as they’d either retired on attaining the age of superannuation or their family members were the former staff members.
The bench ruled that the respondents had insisted that the university was unable to pay those benefits to the petitioners due to financial constraints but didn’t produce records to prove the assertion.

6,Govt planning to go public with Toshakhana records,Bill drafted to regulate repository of state gifts to be tabled in the cabinet for approval.,"ISLAMABAD: As the controversy pertaining to the sale of Toshakhana gifts continues to resonate in courts and media debates, the federal government seems to have decided to put an end to the kerfuffle by making details of gifts, received over the past two decades, public.
The decision to share details of these gifts on the Cabinet Division’s website came on the heels of orders of the Lahore and Islamabad high courts, seeking details of gifts obtained by state officials since 1947.
In June this year, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif formed a 12-member committee to formulate a more transparent policy pertaining to state gifts. The report of the inter-ministerial committee also used to draft the ‘Toshakhana (Management and Regulation) Act 2022’ will be taken up by the federal cabinet in its next meeting along with the proposed bill.
The copies of the said documents have already been forwarded to federal ministers.
In a bid to make the Toshakhana more transparent, the committee in its final recommendations said that “information of Toshakhana gifts of the last 20 years shall be declassified immediately and uploaded on the website of the cabinet division”.
It added that the information shall be updated and uploaded every quarter.

Bill drafted to regulate repository of state gifts to be tabled in cabinet for approval

The committee further suggested that after the approval of the prime minister, the Cabinet Division would “dispose of the gifts either through the display at prominent government buildings, a donation to charities or auction them with the reserve price (market value) set at the assessed market value of the gift”. 
The proceeds from the sale of these presents would be deposited at Baitul Maal or any other charitable organisation.
In its recommendations, the committee said the monetary limit — Rs10,000 — for “free of cost retention of gifts shall be done away with”. 
According to the committee, the gifts could be displayed at important government buildings, including the PM’s House.
The committee had also asked the law ministry to review the Right to Access of Information Act 2017 and propose amendments if needed to address the lacunas therein in light of the “sensitive nature of the matters” being dealt with by the government and the cabinet division.
Pending cabinet approval
Following the report of the inter-ministerial committee, permission was granted to place a draft of the Toshakhana bill approved by the panel and vetted by the law ministry before the federal cabinet for in-principal approval for consideration by the cabinet legislative committee.
The proposed bill stated that it would apply to public office holders and private individuals as private members of an official delegation.
In one of the earlier reports, the committee had added “all government servants civil and military” in the definition of public servants but in the final proposal, the committee rephrased it with “any person, who draws any or some benefits from the public exchequer in any scale or grade or in any office or position” doing away with the specific mention of civil and military words.
According to the bill, gifts received by public office holders or private persons shall be deposited in Toshakhana within “such time limit and manner as may be prescribed”. 
About the management of the gift repository, it said that the division to which this act stands allocated shall be responsible for the management and regulation of Toshakhana.
It added that anyone who attempted to violate Section 3 — pertaining to the submission of gifts in Toshakhana — shall be punishable with a fine equal to five times the assessed market value of the gift.
Minister for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb and Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Interior and Legal Affairs Attaullah Tarar did not respond to requests for comment, despite repeated attempts.

7,"NCOC, NIH asked to issue Covid-19 variant advisory",NIH team briefs NDMA on updated monitoring of regional trends of new variant of coronavirus.,"ISLAMABAD: The Nat­ional Command and Opera­tion Centre (NCOC) management has been asked to issue precautionary Covid-19 variant risk advisory for public and stakeholders, with a direction to the Nat­io­nal Institute of Health (NIH) to take stock of vaccines and arrangements at hospitals in the country to deal with coronavirus cases, after neighbouring countries reported rising infections. 
The direction for issuance of the advisory came from National Disaster Manage­ment Authority (NDMA) Chairman Lt Gen Inam Hai­der Malik at a special session of National Emer­gency Operation Centre (NEOC) on Monday amid criticism by health experts against the NCOC for ‘taking the issue lightly’ by just monitoring the situation rather than issuing fresh guidelines and giving a ‘position statement’.
Lt Gen Malik, who was presiding over the special session, also asked the NIH to review the stocks of co­ronavirus vaccines and arrangements at hospitals to deal with infections and carry out Anti-Covid Natio­nal Preparedness Audit 2022-23.
Trends, tackling spike
A team of NIH, headed by its executive director Maj Gen Aamer Ikram, briefed the NDMA after the new variants of coronavirus spread in China, India and the United States. 
According to an NDMA statement, the NIH team was called to brief the participants on updated monitoring of regional trends of new variant of coronavirus. 
“NDMA chairman focu­sed on evolving Covid-19 variants and expressed confidence in Pakistan’s current strategies and national preparedness. However, the situation will be continuously monitored by NCOC and preparedness, preventative protocols and vaccination administration system will be strengthened to tackle spike,” it stated.
Low positivity rate 
It said the NCOC came up with detailed statistics on Covid management and vaccination administration besides a low risk of new variant in Pakistan.
The session was informed the current positivity rate stood at 0.53 per cent, as 95 per cent eligible population of the country has been inoculated with the first and 90 per cent with both doses of Covid vaccines. 
“NDMA chairman direc­ted the NCOC, ex-NIH to issue precautionary Covid-19 variant risk advisory for public and relevant stakeholders, based on scientific analysis of data at global and regional level, and carry out selective mock drills for Covid-19 emergency,” it stated.
NEOC expansion 
The NDMA chairman apprised participants of the prime minister’s vision on the establishment of a national preparedness and response system in the country. He also explained the NEOC expansion plan by making it live inter-faced with all departments.
