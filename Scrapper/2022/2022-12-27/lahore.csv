0,"Kahna police station ‘takes lead’ with over 10,000 FIRs this year",Eight city police stations need bifurcation due to high crime prevalence,"LAHORE: The Kahna police station of Lahore has registered in 2022 more than 10,000 first information reports (FIRs) and counting -- the figure is higher than average crime rate in 18 high-crime districts out of total 40 in the province.
According to a comparison of the official crime statistics with Kahna police station, this year the Hafizabad district reported total crime 8,601 [FIRs], Mandi Bahauddin (7,661), Layyah (6,914), Rajanpur (8,968), DG Khan (8,750), Pakpattan (9,553), Lodhran (7,834), Chiniot (6,855), Jhang (8,387), Toba Tek Singh (7,949), Mianwali (6,848), Khushab (3,990), Bhakkar (5,562), Chakwal (3,629), Jhelum (5,060), Attock (5,561), Narowal (6,614) and Nankana Sahib’s registered crime was 7,427 FIRs.
The number of FIRs and their handling in a single police station leaves a trail of questions: whether human, administrative and financial allocation is lopsided.
If one station house officer (SHO) can handle that scale of crime single-handedly, why have more than two officers from the Police Service of Pakistan (PSP) and elaborate paraphernalia of dozens of officials in each of the districts?

Eight city police stations need bifurcation due to high crime prevalence

The cases crossed the mark of 10,000 on Dec 24 when the Kahna police station registered an FIR under the Punjab Local Government Ordinance 2022 on the complaint of a citizen Mohammad Khalid.
The police station [Kahna] was largely headed by an SHO of BS-14 ranked sub-inspector and in some cases an inspector (BS-16).
On the other hand, the district is headed by a BS-18 official as district police officer (DPO).
As most of the districts are allotted to the PSPs, the police officers from the provincial service used to raise the issue with the relevant quarters to end ‘discrimination’ by streamlining their promotions so that they could also grab an opportunity to lead the force on higher posts.
An official says the comparison of the crime figures is an example as to how the PSP cadre has been raised in the province ‘irrationally’ to capture many top slots against perks and privileges which can easily be manned by their relatively junior officers from the ranks.
He says the [crime] data [somehow] supports the assertion of a section of the police community which has been asking the high command to redefine the role of the rankers and the PSPs while allocating the top slots in Punjab.
Talking about analysis and the dominance of the PSPs on the Punjab police’s most slots, the official says a DSP ranked officer can better run the police functions as head of a small district adding less additional burden on the national exchequer as compared to a PSP who performs the same duties against hefty packages, including a luxury car, residence, office, POL facilities, government employees etc.  
He says many police stations of the provincial capital have become tough areas to manage ‘humanly’ due to the scale of the reported crime.
Like, Kahna is one of the eight police stations of Lahore which was referred as a ‘study case’ by the senior command of the Lahore police to the Punjab government back in 2018 for bifurcation.
The official says the police department has been giving reasons that it has become humanly impossible to handle the rising crime trend in the police stations marked by it due to their respective jurisdictions, growing population, commercial activities and other reasons.
As far as Kahna police station is concerned, the department had proposed to divide it into three police stations and the case had been pending with the Punjab home department since then.  
Some officers are of the view that the division in at least eight police stations of the city has become a matter of urgency as is evident from the registered FIRs. 
These are: Nishtar Colony 7,965 [FIRs], Factory Area (7,658), Shahdara (7,471), Chuhng (7,263), Raiwind City (7,023), Nawab Town (6,600), Baghbanpura (6,498) and Sabzazar (5,184).

1,‘Punjab best province for investment’,LAHORE: Chief Minister Parvez Elahi says Punjab has been made the best province in terms of investment in a short...,"LAHORE: Chief Minister Parvez Elahi says Punjab has been made the best province in terms of investment in a short period, barriers to investment have been removed and one-window operation facility has been provided for investors.
He was talking to Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce President and Board of Investment Vice-Chairman Chaudhry Gulzar Muhammad who called on him on Monday to discuss the matters of mutual interest.
The process of obtaining NOCs for investment had been simplified, he said and mentioned that foreign investors were coming to invest in various sectors due to business-friendly initiatives. He said Hong Kong-based investors should also benefit from investment opportunities as they would be provided with every possible facility in Punjab.
The CM cited that the property transfer fee had been reduced by 100 per cent for the convenience of people. This fee had been reduced from two to one per cent across Punjab.  
He said the Overseas Pakistanis Commission, Punjab, had been activated to protect the rights of overseas Pakistanis. He said Imran Khan gave the right to vote to overseas Pakistanis during his tenure, but the PDM-led federal government took away this right from them.  
“We consider Pakistanis living abroad as ambassadors of the country and will spare no effort to solve their problems,” he said.
The CM said the provincial government had increased the annual development programme of Punjab by Rs50 billion.
Gulzar Muhammad said CM’s efforts for the convenience of investors were commendable. 
“The confidence of the investors has been restored during your time. Under your leadership, the province will, once again, move towards sustainable development,” he said. 
MASSTRANSIT: The 21st meeting of the Punjab Masstransit Authority was held under the chair of the chief minister on Monday where the managing director briefed him about the procurement of new buses.
The CM said new buses would have separate seats for women, blind and differently-abled commuters.  
Plying environment-friendly hybrid buses would reduce pollution and smog while passengers would benefit from a cheap and quality transportation system; he said, and noted that exclusive bus stops would be set up for women commuters in Lahore.
The chief minister ordered to expedite the buses’ procurement process and said a timeline should be set for the implementation of the decisions. The process should be completed without delay and a report be submitted while deciding necessary issues, he concluded.

3,Posts of constable: Pleas of candidates dismissed for concealing criminal record,LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has dismissed petitions of several candidates challenging rejection of their...,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has dismissed petitions of several candidates challenging rejection of their candidature for the post of constable in the Punjab police for concealing their past criminal record.
Mirza Shahzeb and other petitioners applied for the post of constable and, as per their stance, they qualified all the requisites for the test but their candidature were rejected mainly on the ground that they concealed their previous involvement in criminal cases while submitting an affidavit with the application.
A full bench, which decided the petitions, observed that the police department is a law-enforcement agency performing a very pivotal role in multiple characters in society. It notes that the police have an obligation and duty to function according to the Constitution, law and democratic aspirations of the people.
“Such functioning of the police requires it to be professional, service-oriented and accountable to the people. It is, thus, necessary to maintain high standards for making appointments in the police,” the bench said in its ruling.
The bench observed that all the candidates at the time of moving an application for their appointment as constable were obliged to submit an affidavit qua non-involvement in criminal cases.
“We feel no hesitation to reiterate that the petitioners at the time of submission of their application forms have admittedly concealed their previous involvement in criminal cases,” the judges maintained in the verdict.
The bench dismissed a contention of the petitioners’ counsel that it was not an intentional concealment on the part of petitioners rather they were misled on account of ambiguous conditions.
The bench observed that the terms “concealment” and “misstatement” are not so different and apart from each other.
It resolved that the disclosure of involvement in some offence was a material fact and it was not expected from the petitioners, who were to join the police department, to hide such a material fact.
“A police official should always be honest and law abiding. It is not expected from a policeman to get himself recruited in the department through misrepresentation, misstatement or false statement,” the bench rules dismissing the petitions.
The chief justice constituted the full bench to decide the petitions as there were two conflicting decisions by two division benches on the same matter. The full bench comprised Justice Sadaqat Ali Khan, Justice Mirza Viqas Rauf and Justice Jawad Hassan.

The people of area have lodged a strong protest against the negligence of the civic agency in ensuring supply of water. 
It is learnt that the water supply turbine of Shadman Colony has long been out of order and it’s supply line was connected with an adjoining locality of Dande Maar near Servis Morr. 
However, the on-going digging to lay the sewerage pipeline near the Comprehensive School along old GT road has damaged the water pipeline. Power outages have also added to the problem of shortage of water supply in other localities of the city as well.  
An official of the Gujrat Metropolitan Corporation said that installation of a new water supply turbine in Shadman Colony had already been approved and the execution of the scheme was in final stages a few months ago but still the Public Health and Engineering Department had failed in making the scheme functional as even the electricity connection at the said location had not been installed. 
An official of the water supply branch of city’s civic agency said that efforts to repair the damaged portion of the water supply line were underway but it might take some more time. He said as a temporary solution the affected area could be connected to Adowal turbine.

12,VCs of 32 public universities also reject proposed changes to PHEC,Former PHEC chief says HED wants complete control of commission and end to its autonomy.,"LAHORE: As many as 32 public sector universities vice chancellors and Punjab Higher Education Commission (PHEC) former chairperson have unanimously rejected the proposed amendments to the Punjab Higher Education Commission (PHEC) Act 2014, expressing concerns that the bill would result in a deterioration of quality in higher education. 
The VCs expressed these concerns in an online meeting held at the PHEC headquarters on Monday. 
They lamented that the proposed amendments would open doors to the mushroom growth of private universities without any checks and balances on the quality of higher education in Punjab. 
Denouncing the proposed moves in the Punjab Assembly, the chairman of the Vice Chancellor Committee and vice chancellor at the University of Agriculture Faisalabad, Prof Dr Iqrar Ahmad, said the government should drop the proposed amendments to the PHEC Act 2014 as they would deprive the PHEC of its autonomy and make it a subsidiary of the Punjab Higher Education Department (HED). 

Former PHEC chief says HED wants complete control of commission and end to its autonomy

The VCs also opposed the proposed move of the private member’s bill to deregulate medical education and the unchecked mushroom growth of allied health sciences education in Punjab. 
The proposed amendments have already been opposed by the PHEC Commission members in a full house meeting on Dec 19 fearing that they would curtail the commission’s role to regulate the public and private higher education institutions (HEIs) and make it toothless. 
PHEC former chairperson Dr Nizam told Dawn he was shocked to know about the proposal to amend PHEC Act 2014.  
“I have read the proposed amendments and they are not being introduced for better reasons and the HED is planning to completely control the PHEC and end its autonomous structure.” 
Mr Nizam said the action would bring about resentment in the academic circles. He suggested to the government that if it wanted to keep a check on the institutions it should establish a chancellor office in every university to look after the work of the Syndicate.  
“There was a body, Senate, in the universities act of 1974 and a chancellor would chair the Senate to review and endorse the work of the Syndicate.” 
Mr Nizam said that after if implemented, the proposed amendments would give all powers to the higher education minister while the increase in the number of the MPAs to four as members of the Syndicate in the public universities was already creating problems in the universities established under universities act 2002 and 2018. 
The former chief of the PHEC said a VC should chair the Syndicate and the governor should chair the Senate to keep monitoring the working of the universities. 
While commenting on private universities working, he said the amendments were also proposed to stop monitoring of private universities in the province and these universities were also not implementing any standards proposed by the HEC and PHEC. He said the HED was planning to end the autonomy of the public universities and the obsession of power would lead to further compromise on the quality of education. 
The meeting of the VCs passed a resolution that these amendments would deteriorate the quality of education and hamper the autonomy of the PHEC. 
It demanded the government drop the plan of amendments to the PHEC Act 2014 and consult all the stakeholders before going for any such move. 
The meeting was attended by VCs from public sector universities across Punjab, including Islamia University Bahawalpur, University of Home Economics, Lahore, University of Agriculture Faisalabad, Women University Multan, Emerson University Multan, MNS University of Engineering and Technology Multan, University of Sahiwal, GC university Faisalabad, University of Education Lahore, Punjab Tianjin University of Technology Lahore, Punjab University of Technology Rasul, Mir Chakar Khan Rind University DG Khan, Ghazi University DG Khan, Fatima Jinnah Women University Rawalpindi, King Edward Medical University Lahore, Fatima Jinnah Medical University Lahore, UET Lahore, Information Technology University Lahore, University of the Punjab Lahore, Bahauddin Zakariya University Multan, GC University Lahore, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, University of Sargodha, University of Health Sciences Lahore, University of Gujrat, Govt College Women University Faisalabad, MNS University of Agriculture Multan, Nishtar Medical University Multan, and others. 
At the end, all participants endorsed that the efforts for undermining the PHEC Act for evaluating, monitoring and accreditation should not be proceeded in any manner whatsoever.

15,"If winter comes, can gas supply go on in Lahore?","Cold weather worsens low gas pressure, outages crises.","LAHORE: With the city temperature plunging to its lowest, various parts of Lahore, especially the tail-end areas, are facing either extremely low gas pressure or no gas these days.  
The situation, persisting for quite some time now, is worsening by the day as intensity in the cold weather increases. On Monday, the city temperature plunged to 5 degrees, further necessitating the supply of gas. However, there are reports that many areas of the provincial capital have been without gas even at mealtime since the last few weeks despite commitment of the government to ensure gas supply to all parts of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for cooking.  
“For the last week or so, we have had no gas even during meal hours — 6am to 9am, 12pm to 2pm and 6pm to 9pm. Sometimes the supply is slightly restored for half an hour but it soon disappears,” deplores a resident of Sahoowari, a locality near Shalamar Hospital.  
“This has forced us to purchase an LPG cylinder besides using an electric gas heater to cook food that is becoming very expensive for us,” he said, requesting authorities of the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) to take notice of the situation.  

Cold weather worsens low gas pressure, outages crises

Talking to Dawn, the residents of various localities complained that most of the affected areas consist of lower middle or poor classes that are being given less attention as compared to the posh localities.  
“We live in Faisal Park near the Canal Road. Each year (during winters), we face such issues. But this winter is tougher than the last as we are either facing extremely low gas pressure or no gas,” says a consumer living in the locality. He adds that he and other locals have also complained to the SNGPL but to no avail.  
The residents of Wali Park, Gulshan Park, Mehr Fayyaz Colony, Township, Makkah Colony (Gulberg), Saddar Bazaar (Cantt), Nishat Colony, Kotli Peer Abdul Rehman, Qila Gujjar Singh, Bahar Colony, Model Colony, Shah Kamal, Wahdat Road and others localities also reported similar issues related to gas supply.  
“The locality we live in has a huge population of poor people mostly belonging to the working class. In such a situation (no gas or low pressure), most of them do not have even the capacity to buy expensive LPG or wood or the electricity for preparing food,” says a consumer of the Gulshan Park. He says the people who are already under severe financial stress due to skyrocketing prices, inflation and other issues, must be given priority in gas supply.  
“We urge the government to take effective measures for smoothen gas supply to us,” he demands.  
It merits mention that during the first week of the ongoing month, the Intelligence Bureau (IB) had submitted its report to PM office, pointing out a number of localities in Punjab, KP and Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) having either no gas or low gas pressure during mealtimes. 
The IB checked the areas and submitted its report to the PM who had tasked it with probing such issues. The Punjab part of the report identified 49 localities in the Lahore metropolitan city where gas was not available during mealtime. The report identified areas in other cities of Punjab as well which were facing low gas pressure or outages. 
A source in the Ministry of Petroleum while requesting anonymity dispelled the impression, stating that the SNGPL is the company supply gas to domestic consumers with full pressure these days in all areas.  
“There are issues in some tail-end areas of Lahore and some other parts of Punjab province that are being resolved through supply of LPG cylinders,” he claimed, adding that the people living in such areas should better procure LPG cylinders from the nearby sale points established by the SNGPL.  
It may be mentioned that a couple of months ago, the company had also advised its entire commercial consumers using indigenous gas to sign contracts and switch over to RLNG by Oct 31. By the end of October, around 3,000 of the 23,000 consumers opted for the RLNG. Later, 3,000 more consumers entered into agreements after a team of the SNGPL visited the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) on Oct 31 and requested the business community to help it achieve the objective.  
The LCCI also sought extension to the deadline till Nov 10 to convince the consumers to switch over to the RLNG. Later 4,000 more signed the contracts.
