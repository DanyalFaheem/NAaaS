He said that in the context of KMU’s vision of becoming a global leader in health education and research, the approval of FCPS training was an important development.
He said that starting the training at the varsity would create new opportunities for close interaction and cooperation between CPSP, Postgraduate Medical Institute (PGMI), and KMU in medical education and research.

Scores of residents including a number of PTI workers participated in the demonstration. They also chanted slogans against the PTI lawmaker for ignoring the area in development projects.
The protesters said that Inam Khoro Chinagi was one of the populated localities of Mamund tehsil having a population of more than 5,000 but the MNA didn’t launch any development scheme there.
They claimed that alongside the PTI workers most of the locals had voted for Gul Zafar Khan in 2018 general elections, hoping that he would put the area on the path of development by initiating projects.
The protesters recalled that the PTI lawmaker had also promised them to give special priority to the area in his development funds to provide basic facilities to locals when he was elected MNA.
They said that majority people of the locals had voted for Gul Zafar Khan against a number of influential and powerful candidates in 2018 general elections after he promised to bring about revolutionary improvement in their lives by launching schemes in almost all sectors, especially education, health, road and drinking water.
However, they alleged that the lawmaker was yet to initiate even a single development scheme in the area during his more than four years tenure.

5,PHC asks Peshawar varsity to pay pension to ex-employees,Rules payments will be made to ICP pensioners until govt’s decision on their status,"PESHAWAR: Accepting the plea of over 260 former employees of the Islamia College Peshawar, the Peshawar High Court has ordered the University of Peshawar to immediately release their pension withheld since August this year.
A bench consisting of Justice Lal Jan Khattak and Justice Sahibzada Asadullah ordered the respondents, including the UoP, to make all due pension payments to the petitioners forthwith until any decision was taken by a committee constituted by the higher education department to determine their status.
It declared that as pension payment was necessary for the well-being and peace of mind of the retirees as well as it was their right, their petition was accepted by the court.
The petition was jointly filed by former ICP associate professor Sher Haider and 260 other pensioners seeking the court’s directives for the respondents, including the UoP vice-chancellor, to release the monthly pension of all former employees withheld since August without further delay.

Rules payments will be made to ICP pensioners until govt’s decision on their status

The petitioners prayed the court to declare void the July 26 letter sent by the UoP registrar to the vice-chancellor of the Islamia College University Peshawar (ICUP) for the payment of pension to the pensioners, who had served in the Islamia College Peshawar, the erstwhile constituent college of the UoP.
The UoP has stopped the payment of pension to the petitioners insisting that after the establishment of the ICUP, the ICP was no longer its constituent college and therefore, the pension for petitioners should be released by the ICUP.
The counsel for petitioners, Nazeer Ahmad, said his clients were pensioners of the UoP as they’d either retired on attaining the age of superannuation or their family members were the former staff members.
He contended that the UoP consisted of other postgraduate departments and undergraduate colleges, including the ICP and Islamia Collegiate School.
The lawyer said the pensioners were recruited in line with the procedure prescribed by the UoP and they had served the university until reaching the age of superannuation.
He said the terms and conditions of service of the teachers or employees applicable to other employees were also applicable to the employees of the ICP and Islamia Collegiate School
The counsel contended that retirement orders for them or their relatives were issued by the UoP as the competent authority.
He added that the benevolent fund contribution, the GP Fund and the pension contribution all were deposited in the UoP’s funds and by all means of law, they (petitioners) were the UoP’s employees.
The lawyer said the UoP had also paid petitioners gratuity, encashment of the “leaves prior to retirement” and all ancillary pensionary benefits to them until July 2022.
He said the ICP got the status of the university through a separate Act passed by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly in 2009 and the UoP continued to pay pensions of former staffers of ICP and Islamia Collegiate School.
The counsel appearing for the UoP contended that ICP was no longer constituent college of UoP and it was now attached with the ICUP and therefore, the petitioners should be paid pension by the latter.
He pointed out that for resolving the dispute and determining status of the petitioner the higher education department had constituted a committee through a notification on Sep 23.
The lawyer contended that the UoP had already been facing financial problems and was not in a position to pay the pension of the petitioners.
The bench observed that it reflected from the record that prior to the upgradation of the ICP as university until Aug 2022, the petitioners had been paid their due pension by the UoP without break or ifs and buts.
It added that the petitioners had been paid all pensionary benefits by the respondents since the completion of service term, the act of withholding such benefit to them won’t make sense.
The bench ruled that the respondents had insisted that the university was unable to pay those benefits to the petitioners due to financial constraints but didn’t produce records to prove the assertion.

“Poets and writers have always highlighted the major developments of society. Literati have never stayed silent even in front of oppressive forces,” said Hamdard Yousafzai. He added that the same thing occurred in Swat and other parts of Malakand division when militants tried to enter the region.
He said that residents of the region resisted militants by holding protests. He added that poets and writers also resisted militants through their writings and poetry.
The speakers said that the activists from Gwalerai gave equal importance to social activities, cultural and literary events and took part in raising awareness about human rights and peace.

He urged the youth to give importance to their mother language, culture and traditions.

8,Health dept taking up complaints of hospitals removed from SCP list,Most of the banned facilities want to get empanelled again,"PESHAWAR: The health department has started hearing complaints of those hospitals, which were stopped from treatment of patients on Sehat Card Plus (SCP) for violation of the prescribed criteria.
The department has suspended contracts of 48 hospitals in different districts for not fulfilling the criteria as per agreement. The hospitals have been stopped from providing healthcare services to patients on SCP following complaints about overcharging, poor quality services and lack of infrastructure. The contracts of the hospitals, which have been receiving money from the government in lieu of free services to patients on SCP, had been suspended on December 5.
Now, the grievances committee of health department has started listening to their complaints as most of them want to be empanelled again to earn money. The SCP, which has so empanelled 1,100 hospitals across the country including 200 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, had started reassessment of the hospitals to evaluate their performance and availability of the essential services as per agreements.
Officials said that prior to start of the reassessment, the health facilities were clearly conveyed that those not qualifying the basic criteria or failed to achieve the qualifying score would face suspension and removal from the panel of the approved hospitals. These outlets were informed in September last year to improve their services but they failed to do so.

Most of the banned facilities want to get empanelled again

The department has suspended services in those hospitals for the last six months and they have been directed to remove deficiencies and improve overall healthcare services pointed out during the inspections. After stipulated period, the SCP teams would again carry out inspections to examine the improvement in their facilities and if there is no improvement, they would be removed from the list.
Officials said that there was a complaint management system at SCP, which evaluated the performance of the respective hospitals as per agreement. The hospitals are empanelled by teams of experts to suggest treatments for which they are eligible. Some hospitals have been empanelled for chronic ailments or kidney and liver transplants while others were qualified to carry out small surgeries and procedures.
They said that health department was inking agreements with different hospitals in line with their infrastructure. They added that all the hospitals were required to abide by the agreements and provide services to the patients.
The State Life Insurance Corporation, which is implementing the free treatment programme on behalf of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government, pays to the empanelled hospitals every month but they are required to offer quality services. After the extension of the programme to the entire province’s 9.5 million families, the department is empanelling more hospitals to cope with the load of patients.
“After suspending the services at the hospitals for lack of facilities, the SCP has empanelled 42 more facilities,” said officials. However, they said that there would be no compromise on quality and breach of agreements would not be tolerated.
The empanelled hospitals cannot charge the patients because it is a cashless treatment programme for all the residents of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. There should be qualified doctors, staff, operation theatre, blood bank and ICU in the hospitals to get empanelled for the programme. 
Officials said that many complaints were also related to low quality drugs being given to the patients. They added that it was illegal because under the agreements, the medicines given to the patients should be approved by the Drug Regulatory Authority.
So far, 1.1 million patients belonging to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have received free treatment under the programme costing Rs26 billion.

“The Gujri language is spoken in Hazara division and other parts of the province as well as the country, so the federal government will work for its development like other regional languages,” he said.
The prime minister’s aide urged native speakers of Gujri to educate their children, especially girls, for their community’s development.
He said the children had the right to more and more learning opportunities in their mother languages.
Also in the day, the All Pakistan Istehkam-i-Pakistan Gujjar Convention was held in Haripur with the speakers calling for the inclusion of Gujri language in population census form.
They also demanded the early shifting of the remains of Gujjar leader late Chaudhry Rehmat Ali, who coined the word ‘Pakistan’, from Britain to the country for burial.
The speakers included aide to the prime minister Sardar Shahjehan Yusuf, lawmakers Chaudhry Jaffar Iqbal and Sardar Mohammad Yususf, and Gujjar elders.
The participants included representatives of the community from across the province, Punjab, Islamabad, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan.
They said members of their community had rendered great sacrifices for the country, so the absence of their language from census, Nadra and other key forms was unfair.
They said the voice of Gujjars for their rights would be raise in parliament.
The speakers also demanded the teaching of Gujri language in schools, special quota for the community in FC jobs and resumption of the Gujri news bulletin on the state-run television.

“The 300-megawatt power project is being executed on more than 8,000 kanals of the land acquitted by the administration but even then, the local youths are being ignored for recruitment,” local councillor Mohammad Shakeel Awan told a function here.
The event was attended by the chairmen and members of all 48 village and neighbourhood councils of Balakot tehsil.
The participants resented the delay in payments to landowners and employment of non-locals for the project.

Mr Awan said the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government had already acquired over 8,000 kanals of land for the project.
“Our graveyards and agriculture fields will be submerged in waters but our youth are being ignored by the project executing agency for appointments,” he said.
Another councillor said the 880 megawatt Suki Kanari hydropower project was being executed upstream of the Balakot hydropower project in the Kunhar river which couldn’t end the deprivations of the locals and bring prosperity in their lives.
The Pakhtunkhwa Energy Development Organisation had begun the execution of the Balakot hydropower project in March this year after the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council approved $750 million for it.

During his daylong visit to Mafkoora, a research and development centre, here on Monday, he appreciated the efforts of the body regarding art education. “I found Pakistan a wonderful rendezvous of diverse cultures and languages,” he said.
Mr Wilson inspected different sections of the organisation including library, heritage museum and seminar hall and also attended music and painting classes and took keen interest in the setup. “Providing space to community members where artists, learners and teachers come together to share experiences for celebrating values is praiseworthy,” he added.
He said that such spaces should get community support because imparting art education was like transferring rare cultural and heritage to another generation. He said that it could also help promote the cause of peace economy and building of soft image.
“I appreciate local hospitality and traditions. I have a great feeling to be in Peshawar among the young musicians and experts. It is amazing. Young guys are learning intricacies of music along with important values and history all under one roof in a friendly way,” said Mr Wilson.
