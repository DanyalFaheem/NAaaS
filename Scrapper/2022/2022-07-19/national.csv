0,Imran’s bail extended in 10 cases till 21st,Courts grant PTI chief exemption from attending hearing.,"ISLAMABAD: A district and sessions court on Monday extended the interim bail of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan till July 21 in 10 cases pertaining to violence and damage to public property during the party’s long march in May, while another court confirmed the pre-arrest bail in five cases.
Mr Khan had applied for pre-arrest bail before Judge Kamran Basharat Mufti of District and Sessions (west) Court and Additional District and Sessions Judge (east) of Islamabad Abdul Ghafoor Kakar.
The PTI chairman, however, did not appear before the courts. His counsel, Babar Awan, filed applications seeking exemption from personal appearance of the ex-premier. Both courts allowed the applications and exempted him from mandatory appearance on Monday.
Taking up his plea to avoid arrest in 10 FIRs registered against him at Aabpara, I-9, Kohsar, Karachi Company, Golra, Tarnol and Secretariat police stations of the federal capital in connection with the May 25 violence, Judge Mufti extended the interim bail till Thursday.
On the other hand, Additional District and Sessions Judge Kakar confirmed the pleas seeking bail in five FIRs registered at Bara Kahu, Sihala, Koral and Lohi Bher police stations under various sections of Pakistan Penal Code.
Earlier on June 24, both courts granted interim bail to Mr Khan against Rs5,000 surety bonds in each case. The courts also summoned record from the relevant police stations before adjourning the proceedings.
Also, Judge Mufti had confirmed last month the pre-arrest bails of Asad Umar, Qasim Khan Suri, Faisal Javed, Pervez Khattak, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Shehryar Afridi, Sheraz Basharat, Raja Khurram Nawaz and Sheikh Rashid Ahmed.
The counsel for the PTI argued before the court that the protest march was their constitutional right and the cases registered against his clients were politically motivated.

1,"Early elections likely if Punjab, KP assemblies dissolved: PML-N leader",Asks PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif to return to country to save the party’s politics.,"LAHORE: Federal Minister Mian Javed Latif of the PML-N announced that the coalition government was ready to announce early elections, provided PTI chairman Imran Khan dissolved the Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assemblies where his party was in power.
“I am in favour of fresh elections. If Imran announces dissolution of the Punjab and KP assemblies, the federal government can go for early general elections,” Mr Latif told a press conference here on Monday. About the post-by-poll scenario, he said fresh general elections could right all the wrongs for the party and “guarantee survival”.
Former premier Imran Khan has made a renewed demand for early elections after sweeping Sunday’s by-polls in Punjab that have enabled him to set up his government in the province once again, dethroning Chief Minister Hamza Shehbaz and installing his candidate Chaudhry Parvez Elahi.
Mr Latif also made a reference to the powers that be who, he claimed, did not allow the PML-N-led government to arrest Mr Khan. “Those (establishment) who cr eated hurdles in the arrest of Imran Khan should realise that double standards can no longer work,” he said, adding the PML-N should not carry the burden of the mistakes of institutions.
The minister said his party did not have the mandate to rule the country, but came to power through a successful vote of no-confidence against Imran Khan only to fix the economy. He also asked the party’s supreme leader Nawaz Sharif to return to the country to save the party’s politics. “Nawaz Sharif will have to come to Pakistan if he wants to save the politics of the PML-N.” He was also critical of the party leadership, saying “don’t take decisions on personal likes and dislikes, otherwise the party will face the consequences”.

2,Six swept away in Panjgur flash flood,"Two power pylons fall due to heavy rain and thunderstorm, plunging the district into darkness.","GWADAR / QUETTA: At least six people, including two children, were swept away by flash flood caused by heavy monsoon rains with thunderstorm in Panjgur district of Makran division on Monday.
Two power pylons fell due to heavy rain and thunderstorm, plunging the district into darkness.
Hundreds of mud houses were washed away, families homeless as vast area of the district was affected by flash flood after seasonal streams overflowed.
“Entire human settlement of Marriand was completely submerged as floodwater entered the area after streams overflowed. Many areas of Panjgur district were cut off with district headquarter as link roads washed away by the flood and hundreds of people were stranded in different villages.
“Six people were swept away by flash flood and so far two bodies were recovered while four others were still missing,” Panjgur Deputy Commissioner Abdul Razaq Sasoli told Dawn, adding that massive destruction was reported in the district.
He said hundreds of mud houses were damaged in the heavy rains while the situation is worsening as heavy rains continued.
“We are making efforts to rescue the people stuck in different localities,” Mr Sasoli said.
“Tents available with the administration have been set up in the district complex where rain-affected families were shifted. They are being provided relief goods, including food, drinking water and blankets,” he said.
The district plunged into darkness after two pylons supporting the 132kv Turbat-Hoshab high tension transmission line fell due to heavy rain and thunderstorm.
According to Quetta Electric Supply Company (Qesco) spokesperson, power supply to Hoshab and Panjgur grid stations was suspended due to the incident.
The spokesperson added that Qesco had started the repair work in Hirronk area on an emergency basis to restore the power supply. He added that the transmission line was being operated on a temporary basis during the repair work. The supply to both grid stations would be restored by Tuesday evening, he added.

3,Ahsan Iqbal highlights plan to boost economy,"Plan focuses on increasing exports and foreign investment, improving tax-to-GDP ratio, dealing with loss-making industries.","WASHINGTON: Federal Minister Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal highlighted the current government’s plan for boosting the national economy and rebuilding the relationship with the United States at a Sunday night dinner in Washington — hours after PTI trounced the ruling coalition in the Punjab by-elections.
He repeated some of these points in the briefing he gave to the US media on Monday, telling Americans that “a strong partnership with Pakistan serves the interests of both nations.”
The minister presented a four-point plan for revitalising the economy: increasing exports, encouraging foreign investment, improving the tax-to-GDP ratio, and dealing with the loss-making, government-owned industries.
His plan for improving ties with the US involves the Pakistani-American community in a way that would require the government to win their trust. He emphasised this point at the embassy as well as at gatherings in New York, Washington and at a doctors’ convention in Atlantic City.
What he did not say — or at least the press release issued by the embassy did not elaborate — is how a government which, at best, has only a year left, can achieve these major goals? And how will it win over a community whose sympathy lies with its rival?
At the convention in Atlantic City, the community made it obvious who it sympathises with as they made no attempt to hide their preference for Imran Khan.
The slogans they chanted condemned the alleged corruption of the present rulers. They also condemned the unceremonious departure of the PTI govt. Some deman­ded immediate elections while the majority also criticised the present government for rescinding the right to vote for overseas Pakistanis, granted by their predecessors.
The meeting turned into a shouting-match and the organisers had to remind the crowd — again and again — that “you are educated physicians,” not an unruly crowd.
The minister handled it well. He reminded the audience that “millions of Pakistanis vote for each of the three major parties, PML-N, PTI and PPP. So, none of these should be labeled as traitors.”
Appealing for tolerance, Ahsan Iqbal said that “differing from the views of any leader, Nawaz Sharif, Asif Zardari or Imran Khan, is neither treason nor blasphemy.”
At one point, however, he got a little upset and told the audience “the crowd in my village behaves better.” One of the doctors, however, claimed that the crowd in Pakistani “villages have been subdued while those in America have the freedom to express their views.”

Says Nelson Mandela exemplified courage, commitment to freedom

He said Mr Mandela exemplified courage, compassion and commitment to freedom, peace and social justice.
“He (Mandela) lived by these principles and was prepared to sacrifice his liberty and even his life for them,” the president said.
He said that in the face of great adversity, Mr Mandela displayed extreme courage and resilience and proved that “all of us have the ability and responsibility to fight against the blight of racism, discrimination, hate, polarisation, poverty, and inequalities with positive thinking, social cohesion and forgiveness and passion to build a better future for all”.
“Nelson Mandela spent 27 years in prison fighting against his country’s discriminatory apartheid system of racial segregation without losing hope and finally succeeded in bringing an end to apartheid and ushered in a peaceful transition to majority rule,” he added.
