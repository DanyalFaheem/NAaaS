“We have no plans to participate in the new spectrum auction but the  terms and conditions should be the same as they were during the last  auction,” Mr Bamatraf said while speaking at the announcement of the  second quarter financial results after the PTCL group board  meeting.
He also expressed concerns over the high fuel rates that led to the drop of company’s accounts in the ‘red’ despite posting higher revenues in the first six months of 2022.
He highlighted that the overall PTCL group revenues witnessed a growth of 5.7 per cent in 6MCY22 compared to the same period last year.

1,Political uncertainties push dollar to all-time high above Rs215,KARACHI: The US dollar rose to an all-time high with a record single-day appreciation in the interbank market to...,"KARACHI: The US dollar rose to an all-time high with a record single-day appreciation in the interbank market to reach Rs215.20, on the back of fears that the IMF and other sources of foreign exchange would dry up with a change in the political scenario after PTI’s win in the Punjab by-polls.
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reported that the dollar increased by Rs4.25 against the July 15 closing price of Rs210.95.  
In the first session, the greenback shot up to Rs217 but gradually came down to the level reported by the SBP. However, the exchange companies reported it was closed at Rs216.20.
“The country is paying a heavy cost of the political uncertainties looming large over Pakistan for more than six months,” said Atif Ahmed, a currency dealer in the interbank market.
He said the hopes for inflows from IMF and other sources, as assured by Finance Minister Miftah Ismail, have vanished.
“The reality is that the SBP’s foreign exchange reserves have been declining each day, the inflows are out of sight while imports are still on the higher side,” said the currency dealer.
The dollar was at its peak on June 22 as it rose to Rs211.93 and fell to to Rs207.23 on June 23, posting a record depreciation of Rs4.70 in a single session.
The massive fluctuations in the exchange rate reflect the magnitude of changing political scenario. Despite record inflows of remittances and export proceeds, the trade deficit for FY22 was over $48bn which further pushed the current account deficit to a dangerous level.
After PTI’s surprise win in Punjab by-polls on Sunday, many political parties have started demanding fresh general elections. 
The news of reaching a staff level agreement with the IMF didn’t boost market sentiments as the local currency continued its downward trajectory. The US dollar kept its complete domination during the entire fiscal year FY22 and FY23 is also facing the same situation.
With the declining foreign exchange reserves, the State Bank’s payment capacity has become questionable in the financial sector, resulting in declining confidence of the market in the country’s capacity to meet its external obligations mainly the debt repayments.
In the open market, the dollar was traded at Rs216 against Rs211 in the previous session.

2,"Security deteriorates, especially in Karachi, lament CEOs",Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry sends interior minister a wake-up call.,"KARACHI: The Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) has approached Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah Khan over the deteriorating law and order situation, especially in Karachi.
Referring to a recent survey conducted by the representative body of over 200 multinationals operating in Pakistan, the OICCI head told Mr Khan that 70 per cent of the CEOs polled reported security among the top three concerns for them versus 60pc a year ago.
The overall security situation has deteriorated notably in Karachi and Sindh, the survey said. “This is in contrast to the previous similar security surveys, which showed a constant improvement over the past seven years, especially in Karachi,” the survey said.
The OICCI conducted its annual security survey in May and June and polled as many as 115 members.

OICCI sends interior minister a wake-up call

The survey report said the recent high-profile incident involving Chinese expatriates appears to be one of the reasons for the growing security concern in Karachi.



 
“About half of the respondents felt that the security situation had some effect on their operations and associated businesses (suppliers/vendors and consumers) with 56pc of the respondents citing an increase in street crimes being faced by their employees,” it said.
The chamber urged law enforcement agencies and other government authorities responsible for promoting investment and business activities to strengthen the overall security environment while especially focusing on foreigners’ security and street crimes in the industrial cities of Karachi, Lahore and Faisalabad.

3,"IMF pact ‘credit positive’ for Pakistan, says Moody’s","Warns of political challenges to complete bailout programme; says govt may find raising petroleum levies, power tariffs difficult.","ISLAMABAD: Moody’s Investors Service on Monday termed the staff level agreement (SLA) signed by Pakistan with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the revival of its programme as ‘credit positive’ and hoped it would ease pressure on declining foreign exchange reserves.
But the credit rating agency wondered whether the government could afford to keep raising petroleum taxes and electricity tariffs in the run-up to the 2023 general elections.
“The agreement is credit positive for Pakistan because it paves the way for the release of $1.2 billion in IMF financing at a time when its foreign exchange reserves are under significant pressure”, said Moody’s. This is likely to unlock additional funding from other multilateral and bilateral partners.
It, however, warned that Pakistan’s ability to complete the current programme and maintain a credible policy path that supports further financing remains highly uncertain, while elevated inflation and a higher cost of living are adding to social and political risks. 

Warns of political challenges to complete bailout programme

The government may also find it difficult to continually enact revenue-raising reforms, such as steadily increasing petroleum levies and raising power tariffs, particularly in the run-up to the next general elections scheduled for mid-2023.
The Moody’s comments based on SLA reached on July 14 for completion of 7th and 8th reviews for disbursement of $1.2bn, subject to approval by the IMF Executive Board, did not take into account the election setback to the PMLN in the country’s largest Punjab province.
The agency also expected the country’s current account deficit had widened since mid-2021 on higher food and oil prices and stronger demand for imports combined with domestic political uncertainty, leading to a sharp devaluation of Pakistan’s currency and resultant further jump in import costs.
It estimated the current account deficit to narrow to 3.5-4pc of GDP in the fiscal year 2023 from 4.5-5pc in fiscal 2022 as imports moderate amid slowing growth and measures to curb nonessential imports. However, Pakistan’s financing needs would remain high amid continued high global commodity prices and the need to repay external debt, it said.
Moody’s expected “the IMF Executive Board to approve the $1.2bn disbursement in the third quarter of this year” and added that it also expected Pakistan to maintain its engagement with the IMF, which would catalyze financing from other external sources as it focuses on policy priorities that the IMF has identified, including implementing the fiscal 2023 budget, making progress on power sector reforms, lowering inflation, reducing poverty, enhancing governance and mitigating corruption.
The agency said it expected Pakistan to be able to meet its external financing needs for the next few years.

4,Large-scale manufacturing expands 11.7pc in 11MFY22,"Month-on-month, big industry production shrinks 1.3pc in May as five out of 15 sub-sectors dip.","ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) reported on Monday that large-scale manufacturing (LSM) grew 21.4 per cent year-on-year in May.
However, on month-on-month basis the LSM shrank by 1.3pc in May.  In the first  month of the PML-N-led coalition government, the big industry output shrank 13.3pc month-on-month.
In the first 11 months (July-May) of FY22, LSM grew by 11.7pc on a YoY  basis as per the new base. However, the growth is calculated at 7.1pc in  the 11 months on the basis of the old base-2005-06.
The big industry posted a robust growth of 26.6pc in March, the last month of the PTI government. In April, however, the LSM increased by 15.4pc YoY. The production estimation for LSM industries was made on the new basis year of 2015-16. However, the PBS also released a separate estimation with an old base of 2005-06.

Month-on-month, big industry production shrinks 1.3pc in May

As per the old base 2005-06, the LSM grew by 9.9pc in May compared to a year ago. On a month-on-month basis, the industry’s production declined by 0.04pc. The calculations in both estimations show a downward trend as LSM entered negative growth on a month-on-month basis.
The PBS snapshot of manufacturing activity showed that five out of 15 sub-sectors in the LSM dipped in May. High interest rates and the depreciation of the rupee have increased the cost of raw materials further, and economic activity is expected to slightly slow down during the current financial year.
The LSM, at 9.73pc of GDP, dominates the overall manufacturing sector, accounting for 76.1pc of the sectoral share. It is followed by small-scale manufacturing, which accounts for 2.12pc of GDP and a 16.6pc sectoral share.
As per the PBS data, the entire automobile sector showed strong growth in May compared to the same period a year ago. Tractor production increased by 6.1pc, Jeep production increased by 113pc, and Jeep production increased by 48.8pc.
The production of buses rose by 103.7pc, and diesel engines 70.5pc. However, the production of LCVs surged by 10.9pc and trucks by 8.5pc. The production of motorcycles dipped by 6.9pc, while bicycles increased by 44.3pc.
In the non-metallic mineral sector, the production of cement output dipped by 1.5pc in May. The production of glass plates and sheets, on the other hand, increased by 173pc. The steel industry increased billet and ingot production by 47.2pc.
In May, the production of phosphate fertilisers rose 3.6pc and nitrogen fertilisers dipped 2.5pc, respectively.
In pharmaceuticals, the output of tablets fell by 9.3pc, injections by 45.1pc and capsules by 48.3pc. However, the output of syrups is up by 190.6pc and ointments by 8.8pc, respectively.
On the other hand, cooking oil production posted a negative growth of 1.3pc and vegetable ghee 8.5pc in May from a year ago. However, tea blended fell by 34.7pc in May from a year ago, while wheat and grain milling output declined by 2.5pc.
The output of a few petroleum products, including petrol and diesel, posted a positive growth in May.

5,Pakistanis remit record $31.2bn,Highest amount of $7.74bn was received from Saudi Arabia; inflows from UAE decline 5.2pc as compared to FY21.,"KARACHI: Pakistan received record remittances of over $31 billion in the financial year 2021-22 (FY22), an increase of 6.1 per cent over FY21, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reported on Monday. 
The central bank said remittances in June FY22 were 18.4pc higher than the previous month, showing an increasing trend. However, remittances in June were only 2pc higher than in the same month in FY21.
Overseas Pakistanis sent $2.761bn in June FY22 compared to Rs2.332bn in May, showing an increase of $429 million. Despite serious problems on the external account caused by rising trade and current account deficits, overseas Pakistanis maintained their confidence as a show of solidarity with their country.
The country has been receiving more remittances than it has been exporting. However, FY22 witnessed that the exports and remittances were almost at the same position with slight differences in the amount. The country received total remittances of $31.761bn.
According to the provisional data, the country’s exports increased by 27pc and remained at $31.85bn in FY22, compared to $25.16bn recorded during the same period of 2020-21. The country’s exports registered a growth of 10pc on a month-on-month (MoM) basis, increasing from $2.63bn in May to $2.89bn in June. 
However, trade deficit reached a new high of $48.67bn, a 57pc increase. The trade deficit in FY21 was $30.96bn.
The inflows of remittances are more important to meet the trade gap, which cannot be curtailed despite tall claims of banning a number of items for imports.
Further details show that the highest amount of $7.743bn was received from Saudi Arabia, with a minor growth of 0.2pc compared to last year. The remittances from the same country in FY21 were $7.726bn.
The inflows from the UAE declined by 5.2pc to $5.842bn. In FY22, the remittances from the UK rose to $4.487bn compared to $4.091bn, a growth of 9.7pc. 
The second highest growth in the remittances was noted from the United States, which went up by 18.5pc to $3.082bn compared to $2.599bn in FY21.
Inflows from GCC countries increased by 8.7pc to $3.622bn. However, the highest growth was noted in the inflows from the EU countries, as they reached $3.361bn in FY22.

6,Gold shines as dollar dips,"US gold futures settled up 0.4pc at $1,710.20 on Monday.","NEW YORK: Gold recovered some ground on Monday, lifted by a retreat in the dollar as the market toned down the chances of a 100-basis-point rate hike by the US Federal Reserve next week. Spot gold was up 0.2 per cent at $1,709.87 per ounce by 1:58pm ET (1758 GMT), after rising 1pc earlier in the session. 
US gold futures settled up 0.4pc at $1,710.20. Last week, bullion hit its lowest level in nearly a year due to the dollar’s rampant rise, which made gold more expensive for holders of other currencies. “We are seeing quite a nice rebound for gold as the dollar is weaker,” Edward Moya, senior analyst with OANDA, said. 
Gold investors now a little optimistic as the debate is now between a 50 and 75 bp hike by the Fed, Moya added. The dollar index eased 0.7pc on Monday, slipping from its near 20-year high. Data on Friday showed US consumers tempered their inflation expectations in July, a development likely to be welcomed by Fed officials worried that expectations for high inflation could complicate their task of reining in price increases.
