0,First ‘dormant’ stellar-mass black hole discovered,"Astrophysicist Tomer Shenar says the international team has found a ""needle in a haystack"".","PARIS: A team of astrophysicists known for debunking previous supposed black holes announced a discovery of their own on Monday: the first “dormant” stellar-mass black hole spotted orbiting a star in a nearby galaxy. 
While these black holes are thought to be common throughout the universe, they have proved difficult to find, and they have themselves rejected several possible candidates in recent years. 
Now the international team has found a “needle in a haystack”, said Tomer Shenar, an astrophysicist at the University of Amsterdam and lead author of a new study in the Nature Astronomy journal. 
The team was searching the skies for something that could eventually become a binary black hole, in which two black holes orbit each other after swallowing their stars in a supernovae explosion. 
“We found a quite massive star, that weighs 25 times the mass of our Sun, that is orbiting around something that we do not see,” Shenar said. 
They believe the blue star, which is in the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy that neighbours our Milky Way, is locked in a death dance with a black hole that has nine times the mass of our Sun. 
These kinds of black holes are normally detected by the X-ray radiation they emit as they collect material from their companion star. 
But this binary system, known as VFTS 243, is called dormant because it does not emit X-rays _ it is not close enough to suck matter from its star. 
‘Black hole destroyer’ 
Hugues Sana, astrophysicist at the KU Leuven University in Belgium, said the Milky Way alone is thought to have around 100 million stellar-mass black holes, which are far smaller than their supermassive big brothers. 
But only 10 have been found, said Sana, a co-author of the study. 
This could be because many are lying dormant, biding their time to eventually swallow their companion star. 
Sana said observing them was like watching two people dance in a dark room, one dressed in white and the other in black. “You might only see one dancer, but you know the other one is there.” 
Tomer Shenar, the lead author of the study, and other members of his team were among those rejecting previous discoveries, by laying out alternatives for what the data could indicate. Because of this, Shenar said they expected extra scrutiny. 
So they went about meticulously eliminating all the other possibilities, Shenar said, until they were satisfied “it’s either a fat, invisible alien — or a black hole”. 
Then they called the most famous black hole debunker they knew. 
Kareem El Badry of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics has been “debunking black holes one after another” over the last couple of years, Tomer said, dubbing him the “black hole destroyer”. 
“I sent him the data and I told him, listen, we found this object — prove me wrong,” Tomer said. “I had my doubts,” said El Badry, who joined the team and ran his own simulations. “But I could not find a plausible explanation for the data that did not involve a black hole.”  
The discovery could also give an insight into how black holes are formed. 
Stellar-mass black holes are believed to be born during the death of a large star, in a massive supernovae explosion. 
The force of the blast knocks black holes in a binary system into an elliptical, rather than circular orbit. However, VFTS 243 has an orbit that is also perfectly circular. 
“That means that the star immediately vanished into the black hole,” Shenar said. 
“This has a lot of implications as to how these black hole pairs form,” he said, adding that VFTS 243’s star could eventually collapse in a similar way. 
Andrew Norton, an astrophysicist at Britain’s Open University who was not involved in the study, said “this is important evidence that all such stars may not end their lives in supernovae explosions”.  Shenar said he welcomed other scientists trying to debunk the debunkers. 
“If someone comes and debunks this as well, I’m sure they will have a pretty fantastic explanation — like the fat alien.”

1,"Democracy and freedom under assault, says Prince Harry",The Duke of Sussex addressed the UN General Assembly in New York.,"UNITED NATIONS: Britain’s Prince Harry told the UN on Monday that the overturning of constitutional rights in the United States was part of  “a global assault on democracy and freedom.” 
The Duke of Sussex addressed the United Nations General Assembly in New York at an event marking Nelson Mandela International Day. “This has been a painful year in a painful decade,” the royal told delegates.
He cited the continuing fallout from the pandemic, climate change, disinformation and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine before alluding to the Supreme Court’s recent overturning of America’s nationwide right to abortion.
“And from the horrific war in Ukraine to the rolling back of constitutional rights here in the United States, we are witnessing a global assault on democracy and freedom, the cause of Mandela’s life,” Harry said.
The royal paid tribute to Mandela, South Africa’s anti-apartheid hero who spent 27 years in prison before being elected the country’s first Black leader, as  “not only a man of conscience” but  “a man of action.” Harry, 37, invoked that sentiment to urge leaders to tackle climate change, as his wife Meghan Markle looked on from the chamber.
“As we sit here today, our world is on fire again,” said the prince, adding that  “historic weather events are no longer historic.”  “More and more, they are part of our daily lives. And this crisis will only grow worse unless our leaders lead. “Unless the countries represented by the seats in this hallowed hall make the decisions, the daring, transformative decisions that our world needs to save humanity,” he added.
The General Assembly designated July 18, Mandela’s birthday, Nelson Mandela Day in 2009 to honor his life and legacy. Assembly president Abdulla Shahid and New York City Mayor Eric Adams were among other delegates to make speeches.
In a personal moment, Harry said a photograph of his mother Princess Diana with Mandela is  “on my wall and in my heart every day.” It was taken in Cape Town in 1997, a few months before Diana’s death in a car crash in Paris.
“When I first looked at the photo, straightaway what jumped out was the joy on my mother’s face. The playfulness, cheekiness even, the pure delight to be in communion with another soul so committed to serving humanity,” said Harry.

2,Israeli army chief makes first visit to Morocco,Aviv Kohavi’s three-day trip is the first official visit of an Israeli army chief to the North African kingdom.,"RABAT: Israel’s army chief arrived in Morocco on Monday for meetings with senior defence officials, military sources said, as cooperation between the countries expands following a normalisation of ties.
Aviv Kohavi’s three-day trip is the first official visit of an Israeli army chief to the North African kingdom.
Kohavi will meet Morocco’s minister delegate in charge of defence administration, Abdellatif Loudiyi, as well as the Inspector General of the Royal Armed Forces, Lieutenant General Belkhir El Farouk, and senior defence officials, an Israeli spokesman said.
Morocco had cut relations with Israel in 2000 following the outbreak of the second Palestinian intifada, but re-established ties two decades later in a deal that saw Washington recognise Rabat’s sovereignty over the disputed Western Sahara.
Since then, a steady stream of Moroccan and Israeli officials have visited each others’ countries and signed cooperation deals in various fields.
They have included Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz, who on a visit to the kingdom in November last year signed a security agreement making it easier for Rabat to acquire high-tech exports from Israel’s defence industry.
Last month, Israeli military observers for the first time attended the annual  “African Lion” military exercise — vast drills involving thousands of personnel from several nations, co-organised by Morocco and the United States.
And in March, an Israeli army delegation met with Moroccan officers in Rabat, in the first visit of its kind since the 2020 normalisation deal, signing a military cooperation agreement.
The North African kingdom’s mending of relations with Israel re-ignited its long-standing rivalry with Algeria, which in August last year cut diplomatic ties with Rabat.
Algiers cited  “hostile acts” and Morocco’s relations — including on military and security issues — with  “the Zionist entity”, referring to Israel.
Morocco considers the Western Sahara an integral part of the kingdom, while the Algeria-backed Polisario Front has long demanded an independence referendum there.

3,Lions ‘terrorising’ South African community euthanised,Animals killed after residents protested they could no longer walk safely at night.,"JOHANNESBURG: Six lions were put down after escaping from a South African game reserve and terrorising people living nearby, wildlife authorities said on Monday.
Rangers in the eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal killed the lions on Friday after residents protested they could no longer walk safely at night, authorities said.
“Anger was mounting as it was feared that the lions had lost the fear of human beings,” Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife spokesman Musa Mntambo said in a statement.
The lions had killed at least six cows and no longer ran away when coming into contact with humans and instead walked towards them, he said.
Globally, the number of lions living in the wild is falling, but South Africa has an abundant and growing population of around 3,500 of the predators — around one in six of the world’s total, according to wildlife charities. Mntambo said local residents had been  “living in fear for their lives”, adding some would no longer venture into areas used as pasture for their livestock.

4,Malaysia seizes animal parts worth $18m,PORT KLANG: Malaysian customs officials said on Monday they had seized a stash of rare animal parts worth $18 ...,"PORT KLANG: Malaysian customs officials said on Monday they had seized a stash of rare animal parts worth $18 million thought to have come from Africa, including elephant tusks, rhino horns and pangolin scales.  
The Southeast Asian nation is a hub for wildlife trafficking, with animal parts shipped through the country to lucrative regional markets.  
Authorities foiled a smuggling attempt on July 10 when they uncovered the illicit cargo in Port Klang, on Malaysia’s west coast, hidden in a container along with timber.  
The shipment included an estimated 6,000 kilograms (13,200 pounds) of elephant tusks — Malaysia’s biggest single seizure of elephant ivory, said customs department chief Zazuli Johan.  
There were also 29 kilograms of rhino horns, 100 kilos of pangolin scales, and 300 kilos of animal skulls and other bones, he told a press conference.  
The seizure had an estimated value of 80 million ringgit ($18m), he said, adding that it was believed to have come from Africa, without giving more details.  
Zazuli said Malaysia was not the shipment’s final destination, but did not say where it was heading.  
Animal parts such as elephant tusks and pangolin scales are popular in countries where they are used in traditional medicine, including China and Vietnam. There have been no arrests over the seizure.

“National guard units in the north, centre, east and south thwarted 37 attempts to cross” Tunisia’s maritime borders, the National Guard said in a statement.
During the operations,  “455 people were rescued, including 289 of various (sub-Saharan) African nationalities, the rest being Tunisians”, spokesman Houcem Eddine Jebabli said. Tunisia is a key departure point for migrants hoping to reach Europe — usually Italy — and sea crossing attempts tend to increase during spring and summer.

6,Russian shelling kills six; Ukraine president sacks security chief,EU foreign policy chief warns Russia's blockade of Ukrainian ports threatening grain supplies.,"KYIV: Russian shelling of a town in eastern Ukraine on Monday killed six people, Kyiv said, as EU ministers meeting in Brussels insisted that the pressure of Western sanctions on Moscow was working.
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky meanwhile appointed an acting security chief, having announced the suspension of senior law enforcement officials late on Sunday.
Rescue workers in blue helmets were digging through debris and clearing rubble from a collapsed two-storey building in Toretsk in the industrial east that was struck by Russian artillery early on Monday.Emergency services said five people had been pulled dead from the rubble, while a sixth, seriously wounded, had died in hospital.
Toretsk, a town of around 30,000 residents, lies 50 kilometres south of Kramatorsk, a key target for Russian forces, who invaded Ukraine in late February. Russia’s troops have made gains in the eastern region of Donbas recently, capturing the sister cities of Lysychansk and Severodonetsk.
On Monday, pro-Moscow rebels claimed that their next target in Donbas — the town of Siversk — was under their control, an announcement that could not be independently verified.
Grain supply talks
Kyiv, Zelensky appointed 39-year-old Vasyl Malyuk — first deputy head of the SBU security services since March — as acting chief after pulling Ivan Bakanov from the post.
Andriy Smirnov, a deputy head of the presidential administration told Ukrainian television Monday that Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova and Bakanov had been suspended to prevent them “potentially influencing criminal proceedings against employees of the Security Service of Ukraine”.
The night before, Zelensky said security officials were investigating more than 650 cases of suspected treason and aiding and abetting Russia, including 60 cases of officials in Russian-occupied territories working against Ukraine.
In Brussels, the EU’s foreign policy chief warned that Russia’s blockade of Ukrainian ports was threatening grain supplies to tens of thousands of people vulnerable to starvation and said it must end.
“It’s an issue of life and death for many human beings. And the question is that Russia has to de-block and allow Ukrainian grain to be exported,” Josep Borrell told reporters.
Zelensky tweeted that he had had talks with Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro.  “Discussed the importance of resuming Ukrainian grain exports to prevent a global food crisis provoked by Russia,” he wrote.
Russian and Ukrainian negotiators are due to meet UN and Turkish diplomats in Istanbul Wednesday to try to agree an end to the months-long blockade of Ukraine’s ports.
Kremlin advisor Yury Ushakov meanwhile said the impasse would feature in talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan Tuesday in Tehran.
Stay with sanctions: Borrell
Borrell urged the EU not to falter on sanctions against Russia, insisting that they were working, days after Hungarian leader Viktor Orban said the penalties were harming Europe more than Russia. “It is what we had to do, and we will continue doing,” Borrell said.
Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba warned against  “backing down and bowing to” Putin’s demands  “will not work, it has never worked.”  “This is a trap,” he said.

7,UK TV debate axed over Tory image fears,LONDON: Television bosses were on Monday forced to scrap a planned debate between contenders for the leadership of...,"LONDON: Television bosses were on Monday forced to scrap a planned debate between contenders for the leadership of Britain’s Conservative party, as MPs voted again to narrow down the field.
The five remaining candidates — Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Kemi Badenoch, Penny Mordaunt and Tom Tugendhat — had been due to appear in the third televised debate on Tuesday night. But former finance minister Sunak and Foreign Secretary Truss pulled out, Sky News, which was due to host the programme, said.
“Conservative MPs are said to be concerned about the damage the debates are doing to the image of the Conservative party, exposing disagreements and splits within the party,” it added in a statement.
Conservative MPs are holding a series of votes to whittle down the candidates to just two, before a wider ballot of the Tory grassroots.
The latest starts at 1600 GMT, with Tugendhat expected to win the least number of votes and be eliminated when the result is announced from 1900 GMT.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on July 7 he was quitting as Conservative leader after a government rebellion in protest at his scandal-hit administration. He is staying on as prime minister until his successor is announced on Sept 5.
In the two previous televised debates — on Channel 4 on Friday and the ITV network on Sunday — the contenders clashed notably on whether to cut taxes to help ease a soaring cost of living crisis.
But Sunday’s clash turned more acrimonious — and personal — with candidates encouraged to directly criticise one another and their proposals.

8,Three slain in US shooting before passer-by kills attacker,Gun rights advocates seize moment to build case for importance of allowing Americans to carry firearms,"WASHINGTON: A  man opened fire at a mall in the US state of Indiana on Sunday killing  three and injuring two, officials said, the latest armed rampage in a  country plagued by gun violence.
The attack ended when a  “good Samaritan” shot the gunman dead, police said.
“We  experienced a mass shooting this evening at the Greenwood Park Mall,”  Mark Myers, mayor of Greenwood, Indiana, said in a statement. The town is about 16 kilometres south of downtown Indianapolis, the state capital.
The  gunman, who has not been identified, entered the mall’s food court at  about 6pm carrying a rifle along with several magazines of  ammunition and opened fire, said Chief Jim Ison of the Greenwood Police  Department. Those injured included a 12-year-old girl, Ison said, adding that no motive had been established.

Gun rights advocates seize moment to build case for importance of allowing Americans to carry firearms

“Four have been confirmed deceased,” he said, noting that that included the initial shooter. Chief  Ison praised the intervention of the armed passer-by who ended the  attack, calling the 22-year-old man a  “good Samaritan.”
“The real hero  of the day is the citizen that was lawfully carrying a firearm in that  food court and was able to stop this shooter almost as soon as he  began,” he said.
“This has shaken us to our core. This isn’t  something we have seen in Greenwood before,” he said.  “It’s absolutely  horrendous.” 
It is the latest attack in a wave of gun violence plaguing  the United States, where about 40,000 deaths a year are caused by  firearms, according to the Gun Violence Archive.Gun rights advocates will likely seize on the killing of the suspect in Indiana as an example of why it is important to allow Americans to carry firearms.
“We will say it again: The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,” the National Rifle Association said in a Tweet on Monday morning.
It is rare for a bystander to stop a mass shooting in the United States, according to an analysis by the New York Times. The newspaper showed that only 22 gunmen in the 433 shooting attacks since 2000 were shot by a bystander. The incident also raises questions regarding the interaction between state law and the rights of companies and businesses to ban weapons on their properties.
The shooting comes just weeks after the Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb signed a bill into law repealed the state’s handgun permit requirement. Now, anyone 18 years of age or older who is not legally prohibited from firearm possession may generally carry a concealed handgun in public.
The law conflicts with the policy of Simon Property Group, the owner of the Greenwood Park Mall, which prohibits guns on its properties, according to its website. The Indianapolis-based company was unavailable for comment on Monday.
According to Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, private businesses and property owners may restrict gun owners from carrying a weapon on their property.

9,Sri Lanka renews state of emergency ahead of key vote,COLOMBO: Sri Lanka’s acting president renewed the country’s state of emergency on Monday ahead of a ...,"COLOMBO: Sri Lanka’s acting president renewed the country’s state of emergency on Monday ahead of a parliamentary vote to pick a new head of state — a poll in which he is a leading candidate.
Ranil Wickremesinghe automatically became acting president when Gotabaya Rajapaksa resigned last week after fleeing to Singapore. A state of emergency allows troops to arrest and detain suspects, and the president to make regulations overriding existing laws to deal with any unrest.
One was already in place but parliament had not met to ratify the declaration as required, and Wickremesinghe extended it from Monday  “in the interests of public security”, he said. Police and the military, armed with emergency powers, stepped up security in the capital ahead of Wednesday’s election of a new president.
Wickremesinghe, a six-time former prime minister, is being backed for the position by Rajapaksa’s party, which remains the largest in the legislature.
In what was seen as a possible appeal to 14 Catholic legislators for their support, Wickremesinghe said he had asked Britain’s help to complete investigations into the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings that killed 279 people.
Sri Lanka’s small but influential Catholic minority believes the coordinated suicide attack against three churches and three hotels was a  “political plot” to bring Rajapaksa to power, and has long sought an independent investigation.

10,"As 1.5C warming limit nears, interest in sun-dimming tech heats up","Deploying the technology, using special planes, would be relatively cheap and simple, costing a few billion dollars a year.","LONDON: As fossil fuel use continues apace and a hotter planet edges close to passing safety limits, some scientists are exploring a controversial technological stopgap: spraying chemicals into the atmosphere to reflect away some of the sun’s warmth.
Deploying the technology, using special planes, would be relatively cheap and simple, costing a few billion dollars a year, its backers say.
And it could — if maintained — hold down global average temperatures, potentially staving off increasingly deadly climate-change impacts such as heatwaves, they argue.
“I do see it as a likely option” if plans to cut emissions fall short and dangers grow, said Emmi Yonekura, a researcher on the risks of climate  “geoengineering” at RAND Corporation, a military-focused policy think-tank, during an online event.
But the technology, which mimics the sky-darkening effect of volcanic eruptions, also carries serious and unpredictable risks, critics say — with some scientists so worried that they believe research should stop and outdoor tests be banned.
Threats range from potential shifts in rainfall patterns that could spur worsening hunger to rapid, uncontrollable temperature rise if the technology’s use is suddenly stopped.
The availability of such a planet-cooling option could also give climate polluters an unwarranted green-light to carry on — even though  “stratospheric aerosol injection” (SAI) would only mask the problem, not solve it.
Early efforts to create rules to govern its use show signs of stalling, critics warn, making it more likely that one powerful state or even individual could go it alone, potentially to the detriment of others, sparking conflict.
“The more we see extreme events like hurricanes, wildfires, also just heatwaves that have acute impacts - those may motivate key actors to try to protect themselves,” said Jonathan Wiener, co-director of the Duke Center on Risk.
Unilateral use of the technology  “might be very difficult to deal with geopolitically”, said Wiener, a law and environmental policy professor at Duke University in the United States.
Where scientists and policy experts agree is that, as the world speeds towards the lower 1.5 degree-Celsius warming limit set in the Paris Agreement, serious thinking about what happens if the Earth’s climate breaks down must happen — fast.
“We are now entering a situation where the likelihood of overshooting 1.5 degrees is higher than not overshooting it,” said Janos Pasztor, executive director of the Carnegie Climate Governance Initiative, a think-tank focused on how to manage  “climate-altering technologies”.

11,European bison reintroduced to roam freely in Britain,It marks the first time in millennia that the animal will live in wild conditions once again.,"HERNE BAY: As the sun rose on Monday over southeast England, three bison emerged from a corral into a new woodland home as part of an ambitious project to transform the natural environment.
The trio immediately began munching birch tree leaves in the ancient woods near Canterbury, to restore and manage the area with their behaviour — and minimal human interference.
It marks the first time in millennia that European bison — the continent’s largest land mammal and the closest living relative to ancient steppe bison that once roamed Britain — will live in wild conditions once again.
“(It’s a) really momentous occasion today,” Mark Habben, of the Wildwood Trust which is leading the five-year conservation project, said.
“It couldn’t have gone any better... they took a glance back, looked at us and then disappeared into the woodlands,” he added, moments after the release.
The female bison — one matriarch and two younger cows — will now graze, eat bark, fell trees and take so-called dust baths, churning up the ground in the woods.
This creates a multitude of benefits, helping other species forge habitats as the bison become the perfect  “ecosystem engineers”.
“We’re doing this to restore the environment and restore a native English woodland and everything that thrives in and around that kind of habitat,” explained Habben, saying it was  “critically important”.
“We don’t want to be using machinery... using native resources, ecosystem engineers as we like to call them — in the form in this case of the European bison — is exactly the right thing to do.”
The female bison, which arrived after living on smaller enclosures in Ireland and the Scottish Highlands, will be joined by a bull at the site, owned by the Kent Wildlife Trust charity, in the coming months.
