0,SC to hear petition on ‘hate campaign’ against institutions,SCBA distances itself from additional secretary’s 'political statement’ seeking general elections.,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Monday ordered its registrar office to place a petition moved against the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leadership — over an alleged hate campaign targeting national institutions, including the armed forces, the apex court and the Election Commi­ssion of Pakistan — for open hearing.
Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, who heard an appeal in his chambers, removed the objections raised by the registrar office while returning the petition and ordered the matter to be fixed before the court.
The SC office had questioned the filing of the petition directly with the apex court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution, ins­t­ead of first approaching the forums below it.
The petition, moved by Advocate Qausain Faisal through his counsel Hassan Raza Pasha, pleaded that the private respondents, their official spokespersons and other members of the PTI be restrained from making any public or private statements.

The petition also sought court directions for the appointment of a commission to assess the impact and damage of the alle­ged organised hate campaign and suggest legal steps and proceedings to determine individual liability as well as collective responsibility and to stop the negative effects of such campaign against national security institutions, which has adversely affected Pakistan’s relations with friendly countries.
The petition cited the federation through the interior secretary, the PTI and its chairman Imran Khan and former ministers Fawad Chaudhry and Dr Shireen Mazari, among others, as respondents.
The petition also sought directives for Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority, Federal Investigation Autho­rity, law enforcement agencies and Elec­tion Commission of Pakistan to stri­ctly control the publication of alleged organised hate campaign immediately and strictly deal with the violators.

The petition argued that it was a matter of public knowledge that after his ouster as prime minister, Imran Khan had been issuing alleged unfounded, provocative, highly defamatory and derogatory statements in public interviews, political rallies or other means, in print, electronic and social media.
The alleged hate campaign, the petition argued, was designed and calculated to tarnish the public image and severely harm the good reputation of institutions like the superior judiciary, armed forces and ECP. “This [hate campaign] will destabilise and weaken these institutions and demoralise individuals representing these institutions,” the petition feared, adding that these key national institutions were directly responsible for the vital task of national security, administration of justice, law and order and the protection of political rights of the citizens of Pakistan.
SCBA clarification
Also on Monday, the Supreme Court Bar Association clarified the issuance of a political statement from its platform, saying the association had nothing to do with it since any statement or decision of the SCBA was always prepared after consultation between its president, secretary and other office-bearers and the executive committee. “Obviously, the any statement by the additional secretary does not fall within his domain,” it said.
Soon after the by-election results in Punjab, SCBA additional secretary Chau­dhry Riasat Ali Gondal had issued a statement saying the “government had lost majority and the only path to progress is general elections”.
In their fresh statement, issued with the signature of its secretary Waseem Mumtaz Malik, SCBA clarified that the previous missive was based solely on the personal opinion of the additional secretary and the association strongly rejected any impressions and claims that it had any partisan agenda or supported a particular political segment/party.

LONDON: Britain and France were in the grip of a fierce heatwave on Monday facing record temperatures as southwest Europe wilted under a scorching sun and ferocious wildfires devoured more forests.
Forecasters in Britain warned of havoc in a country unprepared for the onslaught of extreme heat that authorities said was putting lives at risk.
Temperatures climbed to 37.5 Celsius at Kew Gardens in southwest London by 1400 GMT, nudging towards the country’s all-time record of 38.7C.
Air traffic was suspended at Luton airport, north of London, due to “defects” on the runway. Meteorologists said the 40C mark could be breached for the first time by Tuesday, with climate change blamed and predictions of more frequent and intense episodes of extreme weather in years to come.
In France, a host of towns and cities recorded their highest ever temperatures on Monday, the national weather office said.
The mercury hit 39.3 Celsius in Brest on the Atlantic coast in the far northwest of the country compared with a previous record of 35.1 C from 2002.
Saint-Brieuc on the Channel coast sizzled in 39.5 C compared with a previous record of 38.1 C, while western Nantes recorded 42 C, beating a previous high of 40.3 C set in 1949.
“In some southwestern areas, it will be a heat apocalypse,” meteorologist Francois Gourand told AFP.
French firefighters were struggling to contain two massive fires in France’s southwest that have created apocalyptic scenes of destruction.
For six days, armies of firefighters and a fleet of waterbombing aircraft have struggled against blazes that have mobilised much of France’s entire firefighting capacity.
In Ireland, the mercury hit 33.0C in Phoenix Park, Dublin — 0.3C below the all-time record set way back in 1887, Met Eireann said.
The European heatwave, spreading north, is the second to engulf parts of the southwest of the continent in recent weeks.
Record temperatures were recorded in the Netherlands (33.6C) with warnings the mercury could reach 38-39C on Tuesday.
Neighbouring Belgium also expected temperatures of 40C and over.
In Britain, the government drew fresh criticism for failing to take the situation seriously enough.
The embattled prime minister was criticised for failing to attend an emergency meeting on Sunday, preferring instead to host a farewell party at his state-funded country retreat.
Deputy prime minister Dominic Raab also drew flak from frontline medics by appearing to minimise the threat from the extreme heat after he told Britons to “enjoy the sunshine”.
The Sun tabloid headlined its coverage of the heat “British Bake Off”, observing that the “scorcher” was making the UK hotter than Ibiza where temperatures were a comparatively paltry 30C.
Britain’s chief meteorologist Paul Davies said the heatwave was “entirely consistent with climate change”, telling Sky News the “brutality” of the heatwave was “astounding” but could become a regular occurrence by the end of the century.
Trains were cancelled and schools closed in affected areas.

2,Joint sitting of parliament put off till Aug 22,Reasons behind speaker's decision remain unknown.,"ISLAMABAD: National Assem­bly Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf on Monday put off the joint sitting of parliament scheduled to be held on July 20 (Wednesday) for unknown reasons.
The joint sitting will now be held on August 22, according to an official announcement by the National Assembly Secretariat. “In exercise of powers conferred by proviso to Rule 4 of the Parliament (Joint Sittings) Rules 1973, the speaker has been pleased to call a joint sitting on August 22, 2022, at 4pm, instead of Wednesday, July 20, 2022,” according to the circular.
Rule 4 of the Parliament (Joint Sittings) Rules 1973, states: “The speaker shall determine when a joint sitting shall be adjourned sine die or to a particular day, or to an hour of the same day: provided that the speaker may, if he thinks fit, call a joint sitting before the date or time to which it has been adjourned or at any time after the joint sitting has been adjourned sine die.”
The last joint sitting of parliament was held on June 9 in which the government had managed to get passed the “controversial” electoral reforms and the accountability laws after President Dr Arif Alvi refused to give his assent to both laws despite their passage from the National Assembly and the Senate.
The amendments to the Elections Act 2017 sought to bar the use of electronic voting machines in the next general elections and those to the National Accountability Bureau (Amendment) Act were aimed at preventing the misuse of law for political engineering and victimisation of political opponents.
The bills had been forwarded to the president for his assent after their passage from the upper and lower houses, but President Alvi sent them back to parliament for reconsideration.
The bills were presented to the president again but he refused to sign them. Subsequently, the bills became an act of parliament after 10 days as per Article 75 of the Constitution.
After accomplishing the task, instead of proroguing the joint sitting, the speaker announced adjournment till July 20 as the government had intended to get some more bills passed in the joint sitting which had lapsed after their passage from one house of parliament.
