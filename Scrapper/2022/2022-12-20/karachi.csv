0,Experts describe Karachi as ‘bowl of poison’ due to worsened air quality,Sindh govt comes under fire over environmental degradation; transport responsible for half of city’s air pollution.,"• Sindh govt comes under fire over environmental degradation
• Transport responsible for half of city’s air pollution
• Sepa’s annual report not submitted since 2014 
KARACHI: The Sindh government came under fire at an event on Monday for the lack of concern and action towards growing environmental degradation in Karachi, which was described as a bowl of poison due to its worsened air quality, taking a heavy toll on everyone, including pregnant women and their unborn children.
The event on “Karachi’s Ignored Toxic Air quality and the Mounting Health Toll” was organised by the Karachi Citizens Forum (KCF)
“The air is so polluted with toxic elements today that the city has literally turned into a bowl filled with poison, endangering survival of all forms of life,” shared Yasir Hussain, an environmentalist who has been studying the city’s air quality for over a year.
Half of the city’s air pollution, he pointed out, was caused by vehicular traffic. “We gradually need to phase out vehicles with internal combustion engines as vehicular emissions are a major source of air pollution. Burning fuel creates harmful byproducts like nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide as well as carbon dioxide,” Mr Hussain said.
He regretted that the successive governments chose harmful ways for energy production, aggravating the country’s environmental crisis and endangering public health.
“We should have made green solutions our priority for energy production and sought help from China, the largest solar panel maker in the world. But the governments opted for coal for energy production.”
According to him, the most traffic-congested areas in the city have the highest level of air pollution and the hotspots include Tibet Centre on M.A. Jinnah Road, Gulshan Chowrangi and Ayesha Manzil.
“We need to have an effective mass urban transport system and move towards zero emissions by implementing environment-frien­dly energy initiatives.”
Also raising serious objections over the Malir Expressway, he said the project would destroy the last green space surrounding the city.
Lack of air quality monitoring
The speakers also criticised the ineffective Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa) which, they said, had failed to perform its due role under the law and development projects were implemented without any environmental review.
The organisation, it was stated, had not submitted a single report on the environmental status of the province since 2014, which it was required to compile every year.
“Right now, 25 to 30 privately installed air quality sensors are working in the city. The irony is that Sepa neither accepts data of these equipment nor put in place its own system for air quality monitoring,” said Muhammad Tauheed, urban planner and researcher at the Karachi Urban Lab.
Mr Tauheed also shared concern over lack of consultation with stakeholders on Karachi’s master plan currently being prepared by the government.
“The city needs to have an effective mass urban transport and waste management systems. These subjects should be given priority in the document,” he said, adding that the city generating thousands of tons of waste daily had no place that should be technically called a landfill site and most of the domestic and hazardous medical waste had no safe ways for disposal.
Earlier, Dr Qaiser Sajjad and Dr Sabiha Khan highlighted how people in general were suffering due to the polluted air in the city.
“Air pollution is a silent killer and the largest single environmental health risk. Majority of the patients today at my clinic report with nasal allergies, nasal obstruction, sore throat, hoarseness, laryngitis and other illnesses, a major reason of which is air pollution,” said Dr Sajjad, an ENT specialist.
Studies, he said, had directly linked heart, lung, skin and brain diseases with poor air quality.
“This situation may get worse. The WHO expects climate change to increase the incidence of malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea, and heat stress, resulting in 250,000 deaths each year between 2030 and 2050,” he noted.
Sources of air pollution in Karachi, according to him, include emissions from factories, air conditioners and generators, burning of waste and unsafe construction.
In her remarks, activist Nargis Rahman said Karachi in recent weeks had become the world’s most air polluted city in the world, beating Lahore and Delhi.
“It’s a matter of life and death. The government must wake up and take action,” she said, citing a 2015 Lancet report according to which nearly 22 per cent of annual deaths in Pakistan were caused by air pollution.

2,Enraged citizens lynch one more robber in Karachi as street crime spirals unchecked,Law student killed over resistance laid to rest amid moving scenes.,"KARACHI: Disappointed with frequent killings of innocent citizens by armed muggers and failure of law enforcement agencies to curb the menace of street crime, enraged citizens once again took the law into their own hands and lynched a suspect on Monday, who shot a young man over resistance in the same Korangi area where a law student was killed one day ago for putting up resistance to bike snatchers.
Korangi SSP Sajid Amir Sadozai said two robbers tried to loot Faizan Qureshi, 34, in R-Area of Korangi-1. As he put up resistance, the robbers shot and injured him. People captured both the suspects and beat them severely before police arrival. 
The police took the injured suspects into custody and shifted them to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, where doctors pronounced one of them dead.
The police identified the deceased as Irfan, 35, and his injured accomplice as Rashid Aslam, 24.
The injured citizen, Faizan, was shifted to Indus Hospital in Korangi where, according to the SSP, his condition is ‘stable.’

Law student killed over resistance laid to rest amid moving scenes

Early on Sunday morning, a young law student, Azhar, was shot dead by robbers over resistance while a suspect identified as Omar Khan was lynched by a mob in K-Area of Korangi.
Funeral prayers 
The funeral prayers of Azhar were held at Eidgah in K-Area of Korangi amid moving scenes. 
Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, Jamaat-i-Islami Karachi chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan leader Nayar Raza, Mohajir Qaumi Movement chief Afaq Ahmed and others attended his last rites.
Prior to the funeral prayers, Governor Tessori called Shah Faisal Colony SP Wajahat Husain and instructed him to curb street crimes. The officers who demonstrated poor performance should be removed, he suggested, adding that intelligence network should be improved and community policing be given importance in controlling crimes. 
Soon after the funeral prayers, the governor visited the Awami Colony police station.
Governor Tessori said that tragic incidents were taking place frequently as previously a student of NED university was shot dead by robbers, then an aspiring lawyer and now another student fell victim to the robbery.
He said he would ask the chief minister to seek report from police within three days as SHOs had to show their performance. If they failed, action should be taken against them, he suggested.
“We are silent on many issues like shortage of power, gas and water, but we can no more remain silent over the killings of young people,” declared the governor. A child of a middle class family got a mobile phone after persuading his elders, but he was killed by robbers over slight resistance. 
If police officers solved those cases, he would call them to the Governor House and present them with ‘gold medals’, he offered.
Meanwhile, the area SHO told Dawn that the police were close to ‘solving’ the murder case as they got some clues to the whereabouts of an absconding suspect.

3,"Route of Orange Line being redesigned, Sharjeel tells Sindh Assembly",MPA Ali Khurshidi calls for extending route of bus service.,"KARACHI: The Sindh Asse­mbly was on Monday informed that the route of Orange Line Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) service, the 3.9-kilometre-long track built by the provincial government, was being redesigned to integrate it with the Green Line BRT for the convenience of people.
Responding to a call attention notice given by Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s lawmaker from Orangi Town Ali Khurshidi, Transport Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said that certain aspects had not been taken into account when the route of Orange Line was designed.
“Now the route is being redesigned to integrate the two bus services,” he said and adding that the operating company had been given directions in the regard.
The MQM- P lawmaker pointed out that the Orange Line bus service had failed to attract passengers due to its unpopular route resulting in a high running cost. 
“People of Orangi Town show no or low interest in the project,” he said adding that only four to five buses, out of total 20 sanctioned buses, were operating on the route.
He pointed out that the passengers of the Orange Line had to walk up to 800 meters to catch Green Line that also posed risk of mugging.

MPA Ali Khurshidi calls for extending route of bus service; MMA lawmaker beaten up by staff of Lyari General Hospital

Mr Khurshidi asked the transport minister to extend the route of Orange Line to the interior parts of Orangi Town.
The minister said that the provincial government was working day and night to provide the best transport facility to the people of the province. “Peoples Bus Service is starting across the province and work is under way on important routes,” he added.
Responding to a call attention notice moved by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf MPA Malik Shehzad Awan, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Mukesh Kumar Chawla said that Imran Afridi, a member of the oil tankers association, would be recovered within three days as important clues were found.
The PTI MPA said that Afridi had been kidnapped 10 days ago in Kashmore and his captors had demanded Rs20 million ransom for his release.
He recalled that another transporter, Adnan, had been kidnapped in Kashmore one month ago and later he was killed by the kidnappers even after receiving ransom money.
Manhandling of MPA condemned
The provincial assembly condemned torture and manhandling of Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal lawmaker Syed Abdul Rasheed allegedly by the staff of the Lyari General Hospital.
The MMA lawmaker reached the assembly with torn clothes and said that he went to the hospital where ‘armed gangsters’ manhandled and detained him for two hours. 
“There were goons roaming in the hospital but instead of expelling them, the management asked me to leave,” he added.
He said that he was beaten and abused by the staff of the hospital in the presence of a heavy contingent of police and Rangers.
He said that he was elected MPA from Lyari and would continue raising his voice, if his constituents did not get medical facilities. He said that Lyari General Hospital was built for treatment of the people and it was not a place for gangsters.
The MMA lawmaker was also allowed by Speaker Agha Siraj Durrani to table a privilege motion on the incident as the treasury also supported the same.
He demanded that strict action be taken against those who tortured him.
Minister Chawla asked him to lodge an FIR against the staff involved in the incident, assuring him that strict action would be taken against the attackers. 
The speaker also expressed regret over the incident.
The MPA submitted a privilege motion, which was later sent to the house’s special select committee.
The parliamentary minister said that a special committee had already been formed and its meeting would be called to look into the matter.
Discussion on law and order sought
Leader of the Opposition Haleem Adil Sheikh on a point of order demanded that a thorough discussion be held on ‘deteriorated’ law and order situation in the province, particularly Karachi.
He also referred to killings of two young men recently by robbers over resistance and took a jibe on the Karachi police chief for asking the citizens ‘not to offer resistance’.
He said that 21-year-old Bilal who was NED University of Engineering and Technology student and 22-year-old Azhar were shot dead when they put up resistance to robbers.
“Our people are being killed and the additional IG asks not to offer resistance to robbers,” he jibed.
The opposition leader said 100 citizens in Karachi had been killed in last eight months while over 82,000 street crimes had also been registered.
He was of the view that dacoits were roaming freely in Karachi while kidnapping cases were on the rise in interior parts of the province. “The law and order situation should be discussed on the floor of the house,” he demanded.
Speaker Durrani said that a day might be fixed for the discussion on the matter, after consulting with the chief minister, who also holds the portfolio of home department.
Legislation
Meanwhile, the house passed The Sindh Protection of Human Rights (Amendment) Bill, 2022 and the Sindh Digital Technology Board Bill, 2022. 
The Sindh Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Management Bill, 2022 was also introduced and referred to standing committee concerned.
Speaking on the amendments, Special Assistant to Chief Minister for Human Rights Surendar Valasai said that the amendment bill would serve as an effective mechanism to safeguard the human rights of citizens without any discrimination.
The house also deferred the discussion on an adjournment motion of PPP MPA Sharmila Faruqui regarding measures required to improve literacy rate in the country after the treasury and opposition members agreed to speak on the motion on Tuesday when no other business would be taken up.
Later, the house was adjourned to Tuesday (today).

Fusion Girls performs at Napa.

 
KARACHI: The National Academy of Performing Arts (Napa) held its annual Open House on Sunday. Like it happened last year, the day was packed with artistic activities that kicked off at 2.30pm and went on for more than four hours.
It’s a decent idea, and since a good number of items takes place one after another, and with elaborate or minimalist setting, the audience finds it convenient to move from one spot to another. One still feels that certain pre-setting arrangements could be done in a professional way because there’s a lot to choose from and to participate in on the part of both viewers and performers.
For example, one really enjoyed a young, all-girl band called Fusion Girls. They were enthusiastic, buoyant and enjoyed what they were doing. One was particularly impressed with the guitarist Sarah Waqar, pianist Cynthia Rose and bassist Liza Louites. They played their instruments with style and panache. It was sad that Liza’s riffs weren’t as audible as one liked them to be. She is a talent that needs to be nurtured. The hitch was that the sound system wasn’t fully supporting the girls. The poor guitarist kept telling the guys handling the sound system to raise or lower the volume. That said, it was a fine gig.

A play was also held on the occasion. It was Shoharon Ka Madressah translated by Khalid Ahmed from a Moliere play and directed by Hasan Raza. It was staged in the open area where once stood a canopy. A healthy number of viewers attended it.
Apart from live music and drama, some of the other items on the programme list for the day were dance performances, readings from works of Urdu literature and a special stint on stage by musician Ahsan Bari, a Napa alumnus.

5,IO told to file reply in case against Aamir Liaquat’s widow,Dania Shah moves application seeking post-arrest bail.,"KARACHI: A judicial magistrate on Monday issued notices to the FIA’s investigating officer  and prosecutor on an application seeking grant of bail to Dania Shah,  the widow of media personality and politician Aamir Liaquat Hussain,  detained in a case pertaining to allegedly leaking his indecent video on  social media. 
Judicial Magistrate (East) Mukesh Kumar told the IO and prosecutor to submit their replies to the bail plea till Dec 20 and adjourned the hearing. 
On  Saturday, a judicial magistrate had remanded Ms Shah in judicial custody  till Dec 19 after the FIA produced her before the court following her arrest from her house in Lodhran district of Punjab the day before. 
On  Monday, she moved an application seeking grant of post-arrest bail,  submitting that neither she had any account on the YouTube or any other  video-sharing social media website nor had she uploaded and disseminated  the alleged obscene videos of her on the internet recorded with her  late husband. 
Ms Shah alleged she could not imagine  defaming or humiliating late Aamir Liaquat being his wife, but she had  been made a scapegoat in a false case under a preplanned conspiracy when  she asked for her share in the inheritance. 
She further alleged that Mr Hussain’s first wife Bushra had extended threats  to implicate her in false cases to pressurise her to not claim any share in the assets left behind by her husband. 
Dua Aamir, daughter of the late TV anchor, had lodged an FIR against her under Sections 20 (malicious code), 21 (cyberstalking) and 24 (legal recognition of offences committed in relation to information system) of  the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016.

6,Administrator seeks KE’s help to energise city streets,"KARACHI: City Administrator Dr Syed Saifur Rahman on Monday said that to keep the citizens safe, it was necessary...","KARACHI: City Administrator Dr Syed Saifur Rahman on Monday said that to keep the citizens safe, it was necessary that street lights remained switched on during the night, for which the relevant institutions would have to play their role.
“There have been complaints of an increase in street crimes due to darkness. Every effort should be made to keep the street lights in good and functional condition. The issue of dues of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) with K-Electric (KE) will be resolved through mutual understanding,” he said while addressing a meeting of the KE and KMC’s law department at his office here.
Dr Saif said the case regarding the recovery of municipal utility charges and taxes through KE bills was being heard by a court. 
The legal adviser of the KMC had been instructed to send lawyers for the court hearing with full preparation so that any documents or details required by the court could be provided immediately, he said.
He told the KE delegation that mutual coordination and cooperation of all civic institutions was necessary to make people feel safe.
“Street lights are an important need of the city, so K-Electric should play its role in this regard so that the streets of the city remain lighted for the convenience of the citizens,” he added. 
He said the KE should also improve its facilities, adding that the KMC would provide all possible cooperation in that regard.
“We all have the same goal and that is to provide convenience to the citizens for which all possible measures are being taken. The process of consultation and communication with all relevant institutions is going on. Better and comprehensive working coordination is the key to success,” the administrator said.
He said the KMC provided basic services to the citizens in various fields and whatever steps were necessary to improve the city infrastructure were being taken.

7,ATC grants bail to two ‘facilitators’ in policeman’s murder case,KARACHI: An antiterrorism court on Monday granted bail to two men held for allegedly facilitating a suspect to flee...,"KARACHI: An antiterrorism court on Monday granted bail to two men held for allegedly facilitating a suspect to flee to Sweden after he killed a policeman in Defence area. 
Khurrum Nisar had allegedly shot dead 34-year-old police constable Abdul Rehman when he stopped him for suspicion of kidnapping a girl in Clifton Block-V on the night of Nov 21. 
Later, police arrested his brother-in-law Amir Qadeer and driver Aurangzeb for allegedly helping Nisar, a dual national, escape abroad using his Swedish passport. 
On Monday, the ATC-VII judge, who is conducting trial in the judicial complex inside the central prison, pronounced his verdict on the bail pleas of both the suspects. 
The judge directed them to furnish a surety of Rs500,000 each with direction to continue to cooperate in the investigation of the case. 
Earlier, defence counsel Sheikh Javed Mir argued that his clients had no role in facilitating or helping the prime suspect escape abroad. 
He said Mr Qadeer had already separately gone to the Karachi airport to drop his wife Ramsha and their daughter, who already had an appointment with the Swedish embassy in Dubai.  
He further explained that in a coincidence Khurrum Nisar also drove himself airport at the same time and travelled separately through Turkish airline, while Qadeer’s family travelled through Fly Dubai. 
Similarly, he argued that the driver Aurangzeb too had no direct role in facilitating or helping the suspect escape, as alleged by the police. 
He pleaded the judge to admit both the applicants to a post-arrest bail, as there was no apprehension that they would misuse it and abscond upon being released. 
According to the first information report (FIR), on the night of Nov 21, policemen heard cries of a woman from a passing car on Khayaban-i-Shamsheer near 26th Street signal, at around 11:30pm. 
Constable Rehman chased the car and got it stopped near the Abdullah Shah Ghazi’s shrine, where he rushed and sat on the front seat of the car. But, the woman got off the car and disappeared. 
The driver drove to E-street, Phase-V extension and stopped in front of a builder’s office, where he and Rehman exchanged hot words.

8,"Thari girls inclined to educate themselves, women compete with men in job market","Resilient, determined and tough, they easily drive tri-wheelers and heavy vehicles in Thar Coal fields.","

ISLAMKOT: As dawn breaks in Mansingh Bheel village, Asiya Bheel wakes up to quickly help prepare breakfast with her mother before waking up her younger sisters and brothers and getting ready for school herself. Her responsibilities as the eldest sister among eight siblings don’t just end there. When everyone is ready, she will also be driving them to school while also picking up her friends on the way.
A student of class nine now, Asiya always wanted to study to become a doctor one day. She was the first female student from her village to attend the Thar Foundation School in Islamkot, when the school started there in 2017.
Thar Foundation is the corporate social responsibility wing of the Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company (SECMC). Though the school’s aim was to serve the people of Thar Block II and its adjoining areas, it fell at a distance from Asiya’s home. Still Asiya would travel the distance on foot to reach the school with her friends, something the girl’s father was not too happy about. Meanwhile, out of concern for their safety, her friends in the village were disallowed to accompany her to school by their fathers. Then following in their footsteps Asiya’s father also told her to forget about school and try to study at home.
“But studying at home is not like going to school where you have teachers to explain lessons,” said Asiya. “I got after my father to let me go to school. And finally he relented. But he also hired a rickshaw to drop off and pick me from school. But that rickshaw was falling apart. It often broke down making me miss school,” the girl shares.

Resilient, determined and tough, they easily drive tri-wheelers and heavy vehicles in Thar Coal fields

“Then my father heard of a training programme for rickshaw drivers being started by the Thar Foundation in collaboration with the Human Development Foundation. My father enrolled in it and he also asked me if I was interested. Of course I was. I learned how to ride a motorcycle and how to drive a rickshaw. Later, after obtaining a licence we procured our own Qingqi rickshaw in a scheme. We convinced my friends’ families to let them attend school. Now I drive my sisters and friends to and from school in that rickshaw after which my father takes over from me to use it to earn from it,” Asiya completes her story of empowerment.
This of course is not the only women empowerment example coming out of Islamkot. The women dumper truck drivers have also earned much fame and respect for their work of transporting coal from the mines to the coal power plant.

They are still there doing phenomenal work driving the gigantic trucks with 14 gears. Mining engineer Sana Mohammad Afzal, who works as officer production with SECMC told Dawn that when they started the Thar Coal project, their aim was not just helping the energy sector in Pakistan but also provide equal opportunities to the men and women of the area.
“We witnessed that the women of this area were resilient, determined and tough in their day-to-day tasks. But they were not literate. Therefore, we took the initiative for our flagship programme of training female dumper truck drivers.
“Our outreach teams went door-to-door to approach females who were 18 and over in age for this. When we saw that they were also willing to join, we set up a proper driving school for them where we educated and trained them. Initially over 50 women were taken on in the programme. Now they play a huge role in supplying coal to the plant. They get proper salaries to work eight-hour shifts. Since they are women, we also take care to give them the morning shift so that they can also manage their households. We don’t discriminate between the male and female workers. Rather we offer an enabling environment to both,” the officer production explained.
Fayaz Hussain, a mining engineer, said that he finds the women drivers far more responsible than men. “They also take special care of their dumper trucks and always keep them clean,” he said.

Nasrat, a 32-year-old female dumper truck driver told Dawn that she had separated from her husband due to financial issues at home and was living with her parents when she heard about the training programme. “Now after working here for three years, I’m making over Rs35,000 a month along with getting a handsome annual bonus. I’m back with my husband. My son is attending school, I also have a one-year-old baby girl, who will also go to school eventually,” she smiled.
“It’s a very good job. We don’t need to work continuously for eight hours. There is a lunch break and different tea breaks, too.”
Asked if any of their husbands had any issues with their working so hard, Ramoo, another dumper truck driver, said that her husband also works with SECMC but on one of their tree plantation projects. “He is quite okay with my job. I also feel happy that all of our six children are going to school and eating well. Life is good. My husband recently bought himself a motorcycle for which he was able to save up,” she said.

11,Release of Rs20bn for KN Shah rehabilitation demanded,DADU: Speakers at a seminar held in Khairpur Nathan Shah demanded Rs20 billion for rehabilitation of people affected...,"DADU: Speakers at a seminar held in Khairpur Nathan Shah demanded Rs20 billion for rehabilitation of people affected by the floods, and asked Sindh government and the Centre to release Rs2.5 million for each deceased person and Rs1m to each family for reconstruction of houses. 
The demands were made the seminar organised by the Awami Jhamori Party (AJP) on the issue of rehabilitation of KN Shah city and its flood-hit villages, which was attended by people from all walks of life. The seminar held the Sindh government and district administration responsible for the floods. 
They said measures were not taken to protect KN Shah city, and urged chief justices of the Supreme Court and Sindh High Court to audit funds released for the flood relief of the city and its rural areas. 
Advocate Syed Lal Shah said: “Still, three to five feet high flood water was surrounding KN Shah city and rural areas of the taluka,” and lamented: “Flood-hit people were suffering from stagnant flood water, but Sindh government was busy earning money in the name of supplying food, water and other basic facilities to them.” 
He added that cold weather has multiplied the problems of flood-hit people and government must supply blankets, warm clothes and tents to them. 
Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf local leader Abid Lakhiar warned if the flood water would not be drained out, the affected people will stage demonstration before houses of the PPP lawmakers. 
Another PTI local leader, Faqir Mohammad Shaikh demanded audit and investigation of funds released to the district administration for relief work.

14,Zardari bargaining away Sindh’s rights to see Bilawal as PM: SUP,Claims PPP’s agenda is to divide the province,"HYDERABAD: Sindh United Party (SUP) president Syed Zain Shah on Monday accused Pakistan Peoples Party co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari of bargaining away Sindh’s rights in order to get his son, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, elected as prime minister. 
Mr Shah was speaking at a press conference at his residence here on Monday. 
He alleged that it was PPP’s agenda to divide Sindh. He rejected the formation of a parliamentary party on new administrative units in the province. He said that SUP would never accept this anti-Sindh move by the PPP, PML-N and MQM-P. He said that SUP and its allies would certainly resist the attempt.
He said that it would be advisable in the larger interest of the country not discuss new administrative units lest some major tragedy occurs. He said that PPP had always played the drama of provincial autonomy in the name of 18th Constitutional Amendment. He said that the PPP had betrayed Sindh by adopting a resolution in the Sindh Assembly to hand over executive authority and powers on natural resources to the federal government under Articles 144 and 147. He said it was more dangerous than the 2012 dual local government system. 

Claims PPP’s agenda is to divide the province

Through this resolution, the PPP had surrendered provincial autonomy to the federal government, he added. The SUP leader alleged that by appointing favourites as district returning officers (DROs), a conspiracy was afoot to commit pre-poll rigging in the second phase of LG polls.
He noted that floodwaters had not been drained out yet from several districts. Practical steps were not taken for the rehabilitation of flood-affected people which was disgusting, he deplored. 
He announced that the birth anniversary of veteran nationalist leader G.M. Syed would be celebrated in Sann in a befitting manner. The programme would be attended by several politicians, he added.
Zain Shah said that he considered the PPP as a dishonest and anti-Sindh party. “This anti-Sindh Zardari mafia needs to be uprooted in view of its 15-year track record of corruption,” he remarked.
Roshan Ali Buriro, Jagdesh Ahuja, Amir Azad Panhwar, Ameer Thebo, Khawaja Naveed and others were also present.

SSP-South Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that Inspector Shahid Adam Baloch was arrested “over his criminal negligence and providing illegal benefit to an accused”.
He said that the SHO had on Dec 17 arrested two men from Defence Phase VIII for allegedly possessing narcotics, but later he released one suspect after getting a bribe from him. 
An inquiry was launched into the incident that confirmed criminal negligence and misuse of powers by the SHO and then an FIR was lodged at the Sahil police station, the SSP added.
On Monday, the investigating officer of the case produced suspect Baloch before Judicial Magistrate (South) Ali Sher Chandio to seek his 14-day physical remand in police custody for interrogation.
However, defence counsel Advocate Mahmood Korejo moved an application seeking grant of bail to the suspect.
He argued that the offences mentioned in the FIR were bailable in nature.
The magistrate granted post-arrest bail to the held police inspector against a surety of Rs20,000.
The court directed the suspect to cooperate with the police during investigation of the case.
