0,First-ever home whitewash staring Pakistan in the face,"KARACHI: In a highly disappointing show, Pakistan face their first Test whitewash at home with England needing just...","KARACHI: In a highly disappointing show, Pakistan face their first Test whitewash at home with England needing just 55 runs on the penultimate day to inflict upon the hosts a 3-0 series loss in the third Test here at the National Stadium.
Babar Azam’s men fell to yet another collapse on Monday when they were bundled out for a paltry 216 as England leg-spinner Rehan Ahmed became the youngest debutant to take five wickets in an innings.
Chasing a 167-run target with more than two days to spare, England plundered 112 with openers Zak Crawley and Bun Duckett giving them a 87-run start before the former and Rehan — coming in as the nightwatchman — were dismissed by Abrar Ahmed.
Cruising at 164-3 at one point with Babar and Saud Shakeel solid at the crease after reaching their half-centuries, Pakistan lost seven wickets for just 52 runs after both lost their wickets to rash strokes.
“We committed mistakes, especially Babar and I played loose shots and that caused a collapse... which was tough to overcome,” Saud said during the post-day press conference.
It all started when Babar — after having scored 54 off 104 balls — pulled a half-tracker by Rehan straight into the hands of Ollie Pope at midwicket.
Four overs later, Mohammad Rizwan became Rehan’s second victim when the Pakistan wicket-keeper was caught behind with his footwork all over the place after adding just seven.
Saud was next to depart, miscuing a sweep off Rehan to find Jack Leach after scoring 53 off 133, leaving Pakistan in deep trouble at 177-6 before Faheem Ashraf was undone by part-time off-spinner Joe Root in similar fashion to his first-innings dismissal off Rehan.
Nauman Ali and Salman Ali Agha provided some resistance on behalf of Pakistan, adding 30 for the eighth wicket before the former was trapped lbw by pacer Mark Wood.
Rehan completed his five-wicket haul with Mohammad Wasim’s scalp, which marked the end of Pakistan’s innings.
“I don’t think it has sunk in yet, but yes I am very grateful,” Rehan said of his achievement after stumps. “I bowled better balls and not got wickets, so to get a wicket is nice, especially when it is Babar,” the spinner added about taking Babar’s prized wicket.
Earlier, Pakistan openers Abdullah Shafique and Shan Masood — who started the day with the hosts at 21-0 — put up 53 together.
Shan indicated Pakistan were looking for quick runs as he smashed three fours off Root in the day’s first over. The left-hander also hit a six before Abdullah struck two boundaries but then was castled by Leach’s left-arm spin in an attempt to play a reverse sweep.

Leach struck again four balls later when he bamboozled Azhar Ali — playing his last Test innings — with a sharp turner to destroy his stumps.
The bespectacled slow left-armer then trapped Abdullah leg-before after seven balls, leaving Babar and Saud at the crease.
The duo went on to combine for 110 runs as they negotiated brilliantly with Leach’s spin in particular. Courtesy of some great footwork, they kept finding boundaries off lose balls before both fell.

1,Messi and Qatar bask in FIFA World Cup glory,Argentinian players recreated the enduring image of the last time they tasted World Cup glory in 1986.,"WHEN the sun came out in Doha on Monday, shining with all its might amid the breeze that’s been announcing the onset of winter, the cityscape had changed dramatically in a matter of a few hours. It was now all peace and calm, the resumption of life after an event that had changed the face of Qatar for the entire world. The world had changed for Lionel Messi in an enthralling climax to the World Cup, the first-ever in the Arab world, the night before. This morning, he would wake up as world champion; a title that’s eluded him so many times in the past but became his destiny here in the desert.
“So many times I dreamt of it, I wanted it so much, I can’t believe it,” Messi posted on Instagram with a picture of himself holding the World Cup trophy. It was a trophy that seemed to be slipping away so many times in a final for the ages on Sunday evening. When Kylian Mbappe, Messi’s Paris St Germain’s team-mate, turned it on belatedly, Argentina saw a 2-0 lead, given by Messi and Angel di Maria, vanish in a matter of a minute. Messi then hauled Argentina in front in extra time only for Mbappe to restore parity and send the game to a shootout. It was there that Mbappe could only helplessly look on as his team-mates fluffed their opportunities to leave Messi in a trance of celebration.
A brief interlude saw Qatar’s emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani take center-stage with Messi, draping him in the ‘bisht’, a traditional cloak Arab men wear at ceremonies, before the Argentina great lifted the trophy. That bit of interference drew criticism but there was more to come. In the meantime, Messi had no problem — after all his paymasters at PSG are the Qatari rulers — and he hoisted the trophy to loud cheers from his team-mates as well as the Argentinean fans who had attended the game in hope of seeing his moment of salvation at the Lusail Stadium.
And as the French players receded into the tunnel, the Argentinian players recreated the enduring image of the last time they tasted World Cup glory in 1986: Diego Maradona on the shoulders of a large crowd, holding the World Cup trophy at the Estadio Azteca. Here in Lusail, the city for the future, and extension of Doha, it was Messi — the man finally fulfilling the promise of emulating Maradona — at the top. Messi, who’d previously stated that the final was going to be his last World Cup game, told Argentine broadcaster TyC Sports in a pitch-side interview that he was going to play a few more games as a champion.
Amid all that, Mbappe, dejected and despondent, walked past scores of reporters with Aurelien Tchouameni and Adrien Rabiot in tow, out of the mixed zone and into the team bus, ready to leave Qatar and head back to Paris where he will be rejoined by Messi at least till the end of this season. Four years ago in Russia, Mbappe had made this final walk dancing through the mixed zone. Mbappe turns 24 on Tuesday. He still has a long way to go.
But the end of the World Cup in Qatar meant the organisers, who have had to endure 12 years of questions and criticism as well as global scrutiny since they won the right to host world football’s showpiece tournament, wanted their moment in the spotlight too. As so, perhaps for the first time, a member of the World Cup’s Local Organising Committee arrived in a mixed zone after the final. Here was Hassan Al Thawadi, the secretary general of the Supreme Committee for Legacy and Delivery, saying he could feel his vocal cords going but yet speaking.
‘CELEBRATIONS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE’
In an interview with Sky News before the final, Al Thawadi had spoken that as many as 414 workers had died building the infrastructure that had helped Qatar host the most compact World Cup ever; in a country built around one city. “Every host nation always builds on the past so it is always considered the best in history up until this moment in time,” he told reporters. “We hosted a unique World Cup, a distinctive tournament that won’t be comparable to any. And what a beautiful final we saw. There have been celebrations inside, celebrations outside.”
Al Thawadi had barely left the mixed zone when the celebrations began. Argentinian players, led by Messi — clutching onto the World Cup, stormed it. It was a celebration inside a place where usually no photos or videos are allowed. No one cared, though. This was a moment in history. The Argentineans sang at the top of their voices and even took a jibe at the journalists from their country who didn’t believe they would win the World Cup.
“Support the national team, support them to the death because I love Argentina, because it’s an emotion I carry in my heart,” they sang. “And I don’t care what those [expletive] journalists say!”
They’d been successful in deflecting questions from journalists here. Now it was time for the celebrations outside.
The final had been staged on Qatar’s National Day and the celebration of the hosts’ national pride coincided with those of Argentina’s. On an open-top bus, the Argentines celebrated at the Lusail boulevard as thousands of fans gathered; many of them from South Asia where the Albiceleste are wildly popular. And then, it was dawn.

2,Messi can decide World Cup future: Scaloni,DOHA: Victorious Argen­tina coach Lionel Scaloni said it was up to Lionel Messi to decide whether he wants to play...,"

BUENOS AIRES: Argentina fans celebrate winning the World Cup with an image of Lionel Messi.—Reuters

 
DOHA: Victorious Argen­tina coach Lionel Scaloni said it was up to Lionel Messi to decide whether he wants to play at another World Cup as the South American nat­ion celebrated a dramatic win over France on Sunday’s.
Scaloni, who was emotional in his post-match press conference at the Lusail Stadium, praised his players for “breaking their backs” to win the nation’s third World Cup.
Earlier in the tournament Messi said the tournament in Qatar would be his last but Scaloni said the ball was in the veteran forward’s court.
The coach told reporters it was up to Messi to set a timescale on his retirement when asked about the possibility of his playing at the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico.
“If he wants to keep playing, he will be with us,” Scaloni said. “He is more than entitled to decide whether he wants to keep playing for Argentina or not or what he wants to do with his career.
“He is such a huge player for us. It is such a pleasure for us to coach him and his team-mates. Everything he transmits to his team-mates is unparalleled — something I’ve never seen before.”
After the match Messi vowed to continue playing international football des­pite realising his lifetime ambition, but he admitted his career was in its final stages. “I want to keep experiencing a few more matches as world champion... my career is nearly over because these are my last years,” said Messi.
Scaloni praised his men for digging deep against defending champions France.
“We have fighters who were very strong despite the goals that we conceded,” he said. These players play for their people, play for Argen­tina fans — that’s what I have always seen,” he added.
The coach was asked what he had told his players at the beginning of extra time after France had come back from 2-0 down to level at 2-2 in normal time, and before the penalty shoot-out.
“I told them we had to be optimistic,” he said. “We kept on attacking and before the penalty shootout the same thing — I told them to remain calm.”

3,Uncertainty over France’s post-World Cup fan meeting,PARIS: French football fans were kept guessing on Monday whether they would get a chance to meet the national team ...,"PARIS: French football fans were kept guessing on Monday whether they would get a chance to meet the national team on its return from Qatar where they lost to Argentina in a nail-biting World Cup final.
Sports Minister Amelie Oudea-Castera said early Monday that the team planned to go to the Place de la Concorde in the French capital after their plane touches down at Charles de Gaulle Airport.
“They want to go to thank their supporters, to spend some time on Place de la Concorde which they have chosen in theory with the French Football Fed­e­ration,” she told France Inter radio.
But within hours, the chief of France’s football federation FFF contradicted the minister, saying the players would head home straight from the airport.
“When you don’t win you don’t feel like wandering down the Champs Elysees or anywhere else,” Noel
Le Graet told the BFMTV broadcaster, in reference to the glamorous avenue running from Concorde to the Arc de Triomphe.
“They have been away for more than a month and they did a good job. They want to go home as quickly as possible,” he said.
But that statement was, in turn, thrown into doubt shortly afterwards when BFMTV, citing sources in the national team’s communication team, said the team would show up after all.
French commentators heaped praise on the defeated side, while highlighting the crucial role of Argentinian captain Lionel Messi.

4,"NZ without Williamson, Southee for India ODIs",Coach Gary Stead will also sit out the January tour.,"WELLINGTON: Kane Williamson and Tim Southee will miss a six-match tour of India as New Zealand juggle their resources to cope with a condensed start to the year.
Coach Gary Stead will also sit out the January tour, with his assistant Luke Ronchi to take charge of a squad to contest three ODIs followed by three Twenty20 Internationals.
While the T20 squad is still to be named, captain Williamson, Southee and Stead won’t be involved.
Black Caps selector Gavin Larsen confirmed on Monday the trio will return home after next month’s tour of Pakistan to begin preparations for the home Test series against England, starting in mid-February.
“It’s a conveyor belt of cricket at international level,” Larsen told reporters. “We’ve got two very important Test matches against England, so bringing Kane and Tim back and letting them recharge their batteries mentally and physically is really, really crucial.”
Williamson last week relinquished the Test captaincy to veteran seamer Southee but will remain skipper in the shortened formats.
A 17-player squad will span two ODI series — in Pakistan from Jan 10-14 and India from Jan 18-24.
Mark Chapman and Jacob Duffy will replace Williamson and Southee in India, with Tom Latham taking the captaincy.
Seamer Trent Boult and all-rounder Jimmy Neesham are both missing after declining NZC contracts and signing to play in Australia’s Big Bash T20 league, while pace bowler Kyle Jamieson remains unavailable with a back injury.
All-rounder Henry Shipley is set to make his international debut.
Larsen said both series will be invaluable for the world’s top-ranked ODI side ahead of the 50-over ICC World Cup in India next October-November.
Squad for ODI series in Pakistan and India:
Kane Williamson (captain, Pakistan only), Finn Allen, Michael Bracewell, Mark Chapman (India only), Devon Conway, Jacob Duffy (India only), Lockie Ferguson, Matt Henry, Tom Latham (captain against India), Adam Milne, Daryl Mitchell, Henry Nicholls, Glenn Phillips, Mitchell Santner, Henry Shipley, Ish Sodhi, Tim Southee (Pakistan only).

5,Deschamps to decide on future but outlook bright for France,Says he will wait before deciding whether to remain as coach of France in wake of their World Cup final defeat.,"DOHA: Didier Deschamps said he would wait before deciding whether to remain as coach of France in the wake of their World Cup final defeat, but the future prospects remain bright for a side brimming with young talent and led by Kylian Mbappe.
Deschamps was hoping to lead the 2018 world champions to back-to-back titles in Qatar, and they came agonisingly close, losing the final to Argentina on penalties following a thrilling 3-3 draw after extra time.
The shoot-out defeat prevented Deschamps — who captained Les Bleus to glory in 1998 — from becoming the first coach to win the World Cup twice since Vittorio Pozzo in the 1930s.
The 54-year-old, in charge since 2012, is now out of contract but French Football Federation Presi­dent Noel Le Graet had said Deschamps would be offered new terms if he reached the semi-finals.
Asked whether the result of the final would influence a decision on his future, Deschamps said: “Even with a different result I would not have given an answer today. Obviously I am very sad. I will have a meeting with the president at the start of the new year and you will know after that,” he added.
Once the dust has settled on a draining campaign, France must turn their attentions to qualifying for Euro 2024, which begins in March against the Netherlands.
France will be expected to qualify without too many problems for the tournament in Germany, which is just 18 months away.
Their recent record is remarkable, with Deschamps having led them to the Euro 2016 final and then to glory in Russia four years ago. They also won the Nations League last year.
France’s campaign in Qatar had appeared cursed before it started with injuries depriving them of Paul Pogba and N’Golo Kante while Karim Benzema also withdrew just before the tournament began.
However, it has been a breakthrough campaign for some young stars, with Aurelien Tchouameni, Theo Hernandez, Jules Kounde and Ibrahima Konate all aged 25 or under.
Randal Kolo Muani had won just two caps before being brought in as a last-minute replacement for the injured Christopher Nkunku.
The Eintracht Frankfurt forward, who comes from the same Paris suburb as Mbappe and is just two weeks older, ended up having a big impact.
He scored against Morocco in the semi-finals and in the final was only denied an incredible late winner in extra time by a brilliant save from Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez.
“Some of the young players showed they are good enough for this level.
There are others who were not here but will be involved in fut­ure,” said Deschamps, who must have been thinking of the 25-year-old Nkunku, the best player in the Bundesliga last season with RB Leipzig.
“We always need experienced players to lead the younger ones but we have a huge pool of talent.”
Some of France’s distinguished veterans will now be considering their futures after what were record-breaking World Cup campaigns.
Olivier Giroud overtook Thierry Henry as his country’s all-time top scorer, while goalkeeper Hugo Lloris surpassed Lilian Thuram to become France’s record cap-holder.
Both, however, will be 36 by the end of this month.
But one player set to lead Les Bleus for years to come is the astonishing Mbappe.
He only turns 24 on Tuesday and yet has already won one World Cup and become the first player in 60 years to score in successive finals.
Given his age, his peak may still be to come as France eye the European Cham­pionship and, beyond that, the 2026 World Cup.
This World Cup has been “a passing of the baton between one generation coming to the final stage of their careers to a new generation led by Mbappe,” said Lloris.
And Raphael Varane, one of five French players who started on Sunday having also played in the 2018 final, said defeat in Doha would make the new generation stronger.
“It is a very young group. We have also built our successes on defeats and so this group of players will bounce back. There is enormous potential,” he said.

Even as Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo scored goals and shed tears in Qatar’s multi-billion-dollar stadiums, its sports administrators were booking new victories off the pitch.
During the tournament, Qatar was awarded the 2025 world table tennis championships and the opening race of the world endurance championship in 2024, adding to its packed sports calendar.
Formula One returns in 2023, and a major renovation of Qatar’s race track went ahead during the World Cup shutdown.
Qatar also stepped in when China withdrew from holding the 2023 Asian Cup football and is to stage the world swimming championships in 2024.
Hosting events is “a very powerful game-changing tool”, said Michael Payne, a former head of marketing for the International Olympic Committee.
Qatar is ploughing ahead with its sporting ambitions despite criticism of its rights record — particularly the treatment of foreign workers who built the stadiums and power the economy of one of the world’s richest countries.
FIFA president Gianni Infantino repeatedly said Qatar was hosting the “best ever” World Cup, and other federations have also welcomed Qatar’s largesse.
An official with the International Table Tennis Federation said “Qatar stepped in to help organise events when Covid devastated the calendar, and its facilities are all in place”.
Qatar won an overwhelming majority in the ITTF vote against Spain for the 2025 championships.
The 2036 Olympics — which will not be awarded before 2025 — is the next big prize. The emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, is an IOC member and Qatar has already bid for the 2016, 2020 and 2032 Games.
Some analysts say its World Cup record will count against Qatar in the Olympic bid.
Changing the date of the opening match three months from the start of the World Cup and banning beer around stadiums two days from the start were “errors”, said Jean-Loup Chappelet, an Olympic movement specialist at the University of Lausanne.
“The International Olympic Committee wanted none of it (for 2032) and I think that after the World Cup it will be exactly the same,” added Chappelet.
Veteran marketing specialist Payne also said Qatar and FIFA had scored “own goals”, but added that these had been quickly forgotten.
The IOC has a declared policy of rotating the Games, and the Olympics have never been held in the Middle East.
But the scorching summer temperatures of up to 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit) mean the IOC would have to switch the Games to the winter months.
Qatar could face competition from Saudi Arabia and Turkey, which has previously bid five times.
The Saudis were part of a Gulf blockade of Qatar from 2017 to 2021.
Ties have since been restored, and Qatar has highlighted the Arab fervour shown at the World Cup to claim its success.
The Saudis pulled off a shock win over Argen­tina, and Morocco reached the semi-finals.
“It remains to see how long the Arab unity and revitalisation of the FIFA World Cup 2022 will last after the final whistle,” said Danyel Reiche, an associate professor at Georgetown University in Qatar who is leading a World Cup project.
Reiche said sport should become “a tool for peace-building.”
Qatar and Saudi Arabia should launch a joint Olympic bid, copying the co-hosting of the next World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada and other big events, Reiche said.
“Co-hosting sporting events with other Middle East countries would add to Qatar’s image of being a good global citizen that has, for example, mediated in major conflicts,” said Reiche.

8,Players to wear floppy hats in Warne tribute,MELBOURNE: Australia and South Africa players will don floppy hats during the national anthems for the ‘Boxing...,"MELBOURNE: Australia and South Africa players will don floppy hats during the national anthems for the ‘Boxing Day’ Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in tribute to late spin bowling great Shane Warne.
The second Test of the series will be the first at Warne’s home ground since the Australian died aged 52 in Thailand in March.
Cricket Australia said day one of the Test on Dec 26 would acknowledge “the significance of the MCG in his career and life”, with Warne’s floppy hat and a ball featured on a plinth on the teams’ path to the ceremony.
Warne’s Test cap number 350 will also be painted square of the wicket for the duration of the Test match, while the stadium’s big screen will show a graphic of the bowler and a highlights package of his career.
Warne had plenty of highlights at the MCG including his Ashes hat-trick in 1994 and his 700th wicket at the ground 12 years later.
Thousands attended a memorial service for Warne at the MCG in March this year.

9,Selectors keep faith in out-of-form Warner,BRISBANE: Under-fire Australian opener David Warner appeared to have the backing of Australia’s selectors on ...,"BRISBANE: Under-fire Australian opener David Warner appeared to have the backing of Australia’s selectors on Monday despite failing in the first Test against South Africa and going nearly three years without a hundred.
Warner has not scored a Test century since January 2020 and a string of low scores, including 0 and 3 against the Proteas on an unforgiving Brisbane pitch, has intensified the pressure on Australia’s top-order talisman.
But chairman of selectors George Bailey said the 36-year-old should not be judged on his performance against South Africa.
“I don’t know how much to read into this wicket or this match itself and say that any batsmen on either side is in good or bad touch,” Bailey said.
“I personally think there’s runs around the corner for him.”
The powerful left-hander has averaged just 27 over the last two years and with tours to India and England coming up, there has been some speculation that he may be playing his last series.
Warner has publicly stated that he wants to retire after next year’s Ashes tour, but he will need to score runs in the next two Tests against the Proteas to secure his place in the squad.
“I still think he’s preparing as well as he can, he’s looking fantastic in the nets,” Bailey said.
“No doubt he’d like a few more runs and to be contributing more at the top of the order, but I have full confidence that it will come.”
Warner’s averages in India (24.25) and England (26.04) are sub-par and during the 2019 Ashes he scored at an abysmal 9.50 runs per innings.
Bailey said the opener was not yet showing signs of succumbing to age.
“I still think he’s moving well. I still think he’s catching well and I think when people start to go, the catching goes and the moving goes,” Bailey said.
“But he’s still an outstanding fielder, still fit as a fiddle.
Australian Pat Cummins, however, may have inadvertently let slip that Warner’s position is not set in stone.
When asked whether fast bowler Scott Boland was safe with Josh Hazlewood returning to fitness ahead of the Boxing Day Test, Cummins talked up the depth of Australian pace bowling.
But he also said former opening batter Marcus Harris remained a key part of the squad.
“He’s a huge part of this team and I’m sure he’ll get a chance,” Cummins said.

“I made the effort and the mistakes it took to be where I am today and I’m proud of it! I wrote my story and ours ends,” Benzema, 35, wrote on Twitter.
Benzema, who scored 37 goals for France in 97 appearances, had to withdraw from France’s World Cup squad before their first match due to a left thigh injury.
The Real Madrid player, who won the Ballon d’Or award in October, had been desperate to feature in Qatar having not been selected when France won the World Cup in Russia four years ago.
He was frozen out of the France team for five and a half years because of his involvement in a blackmail scandal over a sextape involving his former team-mate Mathieu Valbuena.
In a trial last year he was handed a one-year suspended prison sentence and fined 75,000 euros ($79,500).
For the Qatar World Cup, coach Didier Deschamps opted not to call up a replacement and France still had depth in their squad, particularly in an attack led by 23-year-old Kylian Mbappe.
Paris St-Germain forward Mbappe won the World Cup Golden Boot award with eight goals, including a hat-trick in Sunday’s penalty shootout defeat by Argentina following a 3-3 draw at the end of extra time.

South Africa were bowled out for 152 in the first innings and routed for 99 shortly after tea on day two, leaving Australia needing just 34 runs for a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.
“I’ve played in a team in a star-studded line-up, where you are literally playing with greats of the game,” Rabada said.
“I don’t think that happens quite frequently.
“Now, the situation that we’re faced with, there’s a whole lot of players who have come in, who have the ability but need to get used to the international circuit.”
Captain Dean Elgar is the most-capped player in the team with 80 appearances, followed by Rabada with 56. Excluding Elgar and Temba Bavuma (52), the rest of the top six in the battling line-up have 41 caps between them.
“There needs to be an element of patience and understanding but at the same time, you can’t advocate for bad performances. However, we’re quite positive,” Rabada added.

12,No ‘evolving away’ for Venus as American gets Australian Open wildcard,MELBOURNE: Seven-times Grand Slam champion Venus Williams will play her 22nd Australian Open after being awarded a...,"MELBOURNE: Seven-times Grand Slam champion Venus Williams will play her 22nd Australian Open after being awarded a wildcard to the 2023 event next month.
The 42-year-old Ameri­can, twice a finalist at Melbourne Park, is ranked outside the top 1,000 and has not played a competitive match since being dumped out of the US Open in the first round by unseeded Belgian Alison Van Uytvanck.
“I’ve been competing in the country for over 20 years now and the Australian community has always supported me wholeheartedly,” Williams said in a statement on Monday.
“It will be an honour to play for the fans again and Im looking forward to making more memories at the tournament this year.”
Williams has lost her last six matches on the WTA Tour since reaching the second round at Wimbledon.
Her 23-times Grand Slam title-winning sister Serena Williams announced she would “evolve away” from tennis following the last US Open, where she bowed out in the third round.

14,Australia have ‘good problem’ as Hazlewood pushes for MCG recall,MELBOURNE: Australia’s selectors may be faced with a tough call between retaining Scott Boland or replacing him...,"MELBOURNE: Australia’s selectors may be faced with a tough call between retaining Scott Boland or replacing him with regular paceman Josh Hazlewood as the hosts look to seal a series win over South Africa at the ‘Boxing Day’ Test in Melbourne.
Boland slotted in for the injured Hazlewood in the second and final Test against West Indies as well as the Proteas series-opener in Brisbane, which Australia won by six wickets on Sunday.
The late-bloomer grabbed four wickets at the Gabba and is a specialist at his home Melbourne Cricket Ground where he celebrated a seven-wicket debut in the Ashes last year.
Selectors chairman George Bailey said Hazlewood was fast coming back into the frame, though, as he recovered from a side strain, giving the panel a nice headache.
“(Boland) was on the radar for the MCG last year because of exactly what we’ve seen him do,” Bailey said on Monday.
“He bashes a length, and his ability to take multiple wickets in the same over speaks to how consistent he is and the questions he asks of the batter right from ball one.
“He’s going fantastically (but) Josh is recovering really well.
“He had another really good hit-out (on Sunday) and is close to 90% I reckon.
“Hell keep building and clearly we’ve got a decision to make, but its a good problem to have.”
Australia completed victory at the Gabba in two days, batting marginally better than the Proteas on a perilous, grassy pitch that South Africa captain Dean Elgar complained was unfair on the batters.
Thirty-four wickets fell, including the four that Australia lost chasing 34 runs for victory.
South Africa’s batsmen had the worst of the conditions as the pitch quickened on day two, making the relative form of the teams difficult to assess.
