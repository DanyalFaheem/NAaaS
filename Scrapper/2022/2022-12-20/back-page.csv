0,‘Mountain’ of silt cuts Tarbela’s capacity by 40pc,Wapda chairperson says sedimentation due to silt will impact power generation capacity of Pakistan’s second-largest reservoir.,"ISLAMABAD: Around 10 billion tonnes of silt has accumulated in Tarbela Dam, cutting its designed capacity by more than 40pc, a Senate panel was told on Monday.
In a briefing to the Senate Standing Committee on Water Resources, officials of Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) said the sedimentation due to silt will also impact the power generation capacity of Pakistan’s second-largest reservoir.
The silt, accumulated over decades, has now taken the shape of a ‘mountain-like structure,’ just four miles away from the dam’s structure, they said.
The sedimentation mountain was 14 miles away from the dam in 1974 but has moved 10 miles further since then. In future, it could block the dam’s discharge tunnels with tremors.

Wapda says sediment gathered over decades

The dam’s live storage capacity has been reduced from 9.6 million acre-feet (MAF) to 5.8MAF due to silting.
The Wapda had engaged US and South African experts for desilting but the quoted cost was unviable.
Responding to questions from senators, Wapda officials said the examination of sedimentation was a regular exercise to be undertaken every four to six years.
It was reported that desilting — the process of clearing sedimentation — could cost more than the construction of a new dam of the same size.
Based on eight technical studies, the best option at hand was to raise the outlet points so that the dam remains operational even in case of blockage of tunnels.
On October 1, the Tunnel-5 of the dam was closed for 33 months due to ‘unavoidable safety reasons’ caused by the movement of the sedimentation delta, according to senior officials.
The delta, about four-mile-long, was so close to the tunnel’s off-take points that its ‘cone-like structure’ could block them in event of a minor tremor.
“An earthquake can increase the potential danger of clogging due to liquefaction of bottom set and fore set slopes”, an official said.
Since there was no way to stop the sedimentation, it was decided to raise the tunnel’s water off-take levels as a remedial measure so that even in the case of a blockade, water could be discharged from higher off-take points.
The minimum elevation level of Tunnel-5 would be raised from 1,190 feet to 1,348 feet. The level of tunnels 3 and 4 was raised earlier this year from 1,160 feet to 1,365 feet.
As a consequence, the minimum conservation of the overall dam has already been increased from 1,395 feet to 1,398 feet. Wapda also plans to launch a fresh survey to determine if it should be further raised to 1,403 feet.
Unfortunately, the dam’s maximum conservation could not be increased which now stood at 1,550 feet.
However, the closure of Tunnel-5 is set to exacerbate the water shortage as it would deprive provinces of around 40,000-50,000 cusec of water for irrigation in early Kharif months during dry years and about 25,000-30,000 cusec in wet years.
But, with carryover water quantities of one million acre-feet and above, the impact on irrigation supplies would be negligible.
The committee members, while exploring ways to desilt the dam, said measures must be taken to allow sediment flow to a certain degree since it also leads to land fertility.
The committee asked the ministry of water resources to formulate a report outlining short and long term measures to deal with the issue.
Land allotment disputes
The committee also reviewed the details of plot allocation to the owners whose lands were acquired for the dam’s construction.
The committee was told that 1,744 affectees have been compensated.
Around 450 have filed writ petitions before the Abbottabad bench of Peshawar High Court for allotment of alternate agricultural land and increasing the compensation.
Based on the information provided by 450 affectees, only one was found eligible to be allotted alternate agricultural land as per eligibility criteria under the Federal Govern­ment policy of 1967-68.
The committee stressed that the matter should be settled out of court by both parties.
While discussing the unauthorised occupancy of lands allotted land to the affectees in Punjab and Sindh, Wapda reported that no such information was available with it as it was the domain of the provincial governments.Wapda officials asked the senators to forward such cases, if they come to their notice, to the water resources ministry.

1,73-year-old suspect among six dead in Canada shooting,Suspect was shot at by police and pronounced dead at the scene.,"OTTAWA: Six people, including a 73-year-old suspect, died and one was seriously injured in a shooting at a residential building in the city of Vaughan in Canada’s Ontario province on Sunday night, local police said.
The suspect was shot at by police and pronounced dead at the scene, Ontario’s Spe­cial Investigations Unit (SIU) said in a statement Monday morning. The SIU, which investigates deaths involving police, said it was looking into the death of the suspect and that a post-mortem was scheduled for Tuesday.
Authorities have not released more information about the victims or the suspect’s motive.
“We’re in the process right now of doing notifications to those families, so at this point I can’t share any information on the victims or the subject,” York Regional Police Chief Jim MacSween told reporters Sunday night, according to local media.
Police responded to a call about an “active male shooter who had shot several victims” at a condominium in Vaughan, just north of Toronto, the York Regional Police Department said in a statement.
An investigation is ongoing, it said, adding that there was no further threat to public safety.
Earlier, local police chief Jim MacSween told reporters at the scene that the suspect also died after an exchange of fire with law enforcement, adding the shooting took place in an apartment building. “Once the officers arrived, they were met with... a horrendous scene where numerous victims were deceased,” he told nationally-televised news conference.
“They (police) went right into the building and dealt with the situation. One of our officers did discharge a firearm, I can confirm that. And as a result the suspect is deceased,” he added.

2,SC moved to stop Parvez Elahi from funding family’s constituencies,"Petitioner seeks NAB probe into violation of constitutional provisions, procurement laws.","ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court was approached on Monday to seek an order restraining Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi from allocating public development funds for the constituencies belonging to his family members.
Advocate Mian Dawood, the petitioner, also requested the apex court to prevent different government agencies from releasing payments to contractors or placing the public revenue at the indirect disposal of Punjab Assembly members from the constituencies belonging to the family members of the chief minister.
The petitioner said it was an admitted fact that the Punjab chief minister granted his home district the status of division and then allocated over Rs100 billion for development schemes, apparently for two districts — Gujrat and Mandi Bahauddin. He alleged that the chief minister had released funds to the constituencies of Chaudhry Hussain (NA-68, Gujrat-I), Moonis Elahi (NA-69, Gujrat-II), Sajid Ahmed Bhatti (PP-67, Mandi Bahauddin-III) and his own constituency of PP-430, Gujrat-III.
The petition requested the court to declare as unconstitutional the allocation of disproportionate funds to the constituencies of the chief minister and his family members, besides ruling that the allocation or re-appropriation through supplementary or excess grants of funds in the constituencies and the projects have been initiated in violation of the principle of transparency, good governance and procurement laws.

Petitioner seeks NAB probe into violation of constitutional provisions, procurement laws

The petitioner also requested the apex court to direct the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) or any other agency to launch an investigation against those responsible for violation of constitutional provisions and principles of transparency and procurement laws and causing loss or damage to the public exchequer.
“It turns out that 70 per cent of the funds are for the constituencies belonging to the family of the incumbent chief minister,” the petition said, adding that the allocation of funds by masquerading the same as supplement grants is in addition to the non-developmental expenditures to be incurred on building paraphernalia for all divisional offices in Gujrat.
The petition said that it had been reported that Punjab’s total development budget for the fiscal year 2022-23 stood at around Rs700bn of which a significant portion went to Gujrat division comprising four small districts of Gujrat, Mandi Bahauddin, Wazirabad and Hafizabad and the lion’s share was kept within the two families. The major beneficiaries from Gujrat are the constituencies of Chaudhry Parvez Elahi, his son Moonis and Hussain, the son of Chaudhry Wajahat Hussain.
The petitioner cited the Punjab chief secretary, secretaries of finance and planning and development departments, the Planning and Development Board chairman, Accountant General Office and NAB as respondents.
The petition recalled that the apex court had in 2014 held that the prime minister had no discretionary power vis-à-vis supplementary or excess grant and the same was analogically applicable to the chief ministers as well. It was also held in a 2014 judgement that incurring of expenditure by the federal government without following and recourse to procedure provided in Articles 82 and 83 would amount to nullifying these provisions, it added.
Being the guardian of the fundamental law, the petition argued, the Supreme Court was obligated to ensure that the public functionaries adhere to the constitutional dictates and principles of public trust, transparency and good governance while dealing with the public exchequer and funds.
If the interim relief as prayed for is not granted, the petition feared, the public exchequer and state revenue would suffer an irreparable and irrevocable loss. The abnormal allocation or increase of funds in constituencies at the cost of other districts tramples over the just distribution of resources in accordance with the principles of financial propriety, resulting in the regional disparity, which in turn, weakens the very fabric of the state and undermines the social economic cohesion of society and the state, the petition argued.

3,20 injured in twin Khuzdar blasts,"Bombs were planted in motorbikes, officials say.","KHUZDAR: Twenty people were injured, some of them seriously, in two bomb explosions which took place, with a small interval, in Khuzdar — the divisional headquarters of Kalat division — on Monday evening.
Seven people were injured when the first bomb, planted in a motorcycle parked in the busy shopping area of Umar Farooq Chowk, exploded, police said.
Police investigators believed it was a remote-controlled bomb.
As soon as police personnel and people rushed to the blast site to shift the injured to the hospital, another bomb, which was also planted in a motorcycle, exploded, leaving 13 people injured.

Bombs were planted in motorbikes, officials say

All the injured people were immediately taken to hospital.
Senior police officer Jan Sasoli said both bombs were exploded with a remote-controlled device with a small interval. He said that fire erupted after the first explosion and several shops were damaged due to the impact of the two blasts. “We have received 20 injured,” hospital sources said, adding that condition of the three injured was serious.
Some of the injured suffered burns in the blasts.
Later, Khuzdar deputy commissioner along with Kalat DIG and Khuzdar SSP visited to the area.
Meanwhile, Balochistan Chief Minister Abdul Quddus Bizenjo instructed the law-enforcement agencies and administration to arrest culprits and increase security along the Khuzdar highway.

4,Agri monitoring system needed for disaster response,UN’s agency for food security says a system integrating field and remote sensing should be piloted at provincial level first.,"ISLAMABAD: The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has recommended the development of a monitoring system for agricultural advancement and emergency response in case of natural calamities.
The FAO, which is the UN’s agency for food security, has said a system integrating field and remote sensing should be piloted at the provincial level and later exp­anded nationwide.
The FAO made the recommendation in its report titled “A rapid geospatial flood impact assessment in Pakistan, 2022”.
The recent advances in geospatial and information technologies and updated land cover maps, crop-specific information with tailored field campaigns are expected to better support response programmes, the FAO said.
It will also lead to an imp­rovement in crop monitoring efficiency and cost-effectiveness, according to the report.
The assessment was carried out to underline the impact of floods on agricultural land, crop types and people.
As per the report’s findings, almost 50,000 sq km or 6.3 per cent of the total area was inundated, with almost 38,289 sq km of agriculture area or 16 pc coming under water.
Sugarcane on 1,002 sq km, wheat on 7,611 sq km, cotton on 1,359 sq km and rice on 14,925 sq km have been impacted.
Around 580 sq km of forest area, including trees, natural vegetation and plantation, was inundated.
Almost 20 million people have been exposed to floods, the report said, adding that nine million in Sindh, 850,000 in KP, 750,000 in Balochistan and 9m in Punjab have been affected.
The assessment, conducted for all four provinces, showed Sindh was the most-impacted province in terms of damage extent.
The districts of Kambar Shahdadkot, Badin, Jacob­abad, Dadu and Shikarpur were the worst hit in Sindh, while the highest impa­cted districts in KP were Dera Ismail Khan, Lakki Marwat, Tank, Kohat and Karak. In Balo­chistan, the worst-hit districts were Jaff­arabad, Nasirabad, Jhal Magsi, Sibi and Kachhi (Bolan). In Punjab Rajanpur, Sheik­hupura, Dera Ghazi Khan, Sialkot and were the most affected districts.

5,Over 190 nations approve historic Chinese-brokered nature accord,"Congo refuses to back deal, seeking greater funding for developing world.","

Quebec: China’s Minister of Ecology and Environment Huang Runqiu lowers the gavel to pass The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework during the COP15 conference on Monday.—Reuters

 
MONTREAL: More than 190 countries approved a historic deal to reverse decades of environmental destruction threatening the world’s species and ecosystems at a marathon UN biodiversity summit early Monday.
The chair of the COP15 nature summit, Chinese Environment Minister Huang Runqiu, declared the deal adopted at a plenary session in Montreal that ran into the wee hours and banged his gavel, sparking loud applause from assembled delegates.
After four years of fraught negotiations, states rallied behind the Chinese-brokered accord aimed at saving Earth’s lands, oceans and species from pollution, degradation and the climate crisis. “We have in our hands a package that I think can guide us all to work together to hold and reverse biodiversity loss, to put biodiversity on the path of recovery for the benefit of all people in the world,” Huang told the assembly.
His Canadian counterpart and host Steven Guilbeault called it a “historic step”.

Congo refuses to back deal, seeking greater funding for developing world

President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen welcomed the “historic” international deal on saving the world’s biodiversity, calling it “a roadmap to protect and restore nature”. “This agreement provides a good foundation for global action on biodiversity, complementing the Paris Agree­ment for Climate,” she said.
However, the move overruled an objection from the Democratic Republic of Con­go that had refused to back the text, demanding greater funding for developing countries as part of the accord.
Biggest conservation deal
The deal pledges to secure 30 per cent of the planet as a protected zone by 2030, stump up $30 billion in yearly conservation aid for the developing world and halt human-caused extinctions of threatened species.
Environmentalists have compared it to the landmark plan to limit global warming to 1.5C under the Paris agreement, though some warned that it did not go far enough.
Brian O’Donnell of the Campaign for Nature called it “the largest land and ocean conservation commitment in history.” “The international community has come together for a landmark global biodiversity agreement that provides some hope that the crisis facing nature is starting to get the attention it deserves,” he said.
“Moose, sea turtles, parrots, rhinos, rare ferns and ancient trees, butterflies, rays, and dolphins are among the million species that will see a significantly improved outlook for their survival and abundance if this agreement is implemented effectively.” The CEO of campaign group Avaaz, Bert Wander, cautioned: “It’s a significant step forward in the fight to protect life on Earth, but on its own it won’t be enough. Governments should listen to what science is saying and rapidly scale up ambition to protect half the Earth by 2030.”
Indigenous rights
The text pledges to safeguard the rights of Indigenous people as stewards of their lands, a key demand of campaigners. But observers noted it pulled punches in other areas — for example, only encouraging businesses to report their biodiversity impacts rather than mandating them to do so.
The 23 targets in the accord also include saving hundreds of billions of dollars by cutting environmentally destructive farming subsidies, reducing the risk from pesticides and tackling invasive species.
Funding fight
At times, the talks looked at risk of collapsing as countries squabbled over money. How much the rich countries will send to the developing world, home to most of the planet’s biodiversity, was the biggest sticking point.
Developing countries had been seeking the creation of a new, bigger fund for aid from the Global North. But the draft text instead suggested a compromise: creating a fund under the existing Global Environment Facility (GEF).
That concern was echoed by the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Current financial flows for nature to the developing world are estimated at around $10 billion per year. A DRC delegate spoke up in the plenary to demand annual funding rise to $100 billion.
The US is not a signatory to the biodiversity convention due to resistance from Republican senators.
