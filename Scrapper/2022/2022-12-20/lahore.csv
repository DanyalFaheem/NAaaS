LAHORE:  Two men were killed on Monday after the Karachi-bound 34-down Pak  Business Express collided with a motorcycle-rickshaw at an unmanned  level-crossing between Kahna and Jia Bagga stations, about 20km from the  Lahore main railway station. 
The accident also caused derailment  of the engine, a luggage van and two passenger coaches besides damaging  the track badly due to applying of emergency brakes by the driver. The  deceased included the rickshaw driver and a man travelling with him. 
The  train, according to official sources of the Pakistan Railways (Lahore  division), left the Lahore railway station at about 4pm for  Karachi. When it was about to reach the point of an unmanned crossing between the Kahna and Jia Bagga  stations, it hit a  motorcycle-rickshaw which appeared on the track from nowhere . 
“The  accident took place at 4:46pm. Though the driver applied emergency  brakes, he couldn’t avert the collision. The rickshaw driver and the  passenger travelling with him died on the spot,” says a spokesman for  the PR police. 
He said all the passengers including the crew  travelling in the derailed and other coaches remained safe. Senior  officials, including the divisional superintendent and deputy  superintendent of the PR police, also reached the spot.
“A relief  train carrying a crane was also dispatched to the site that put the  derailed coaches and engine on the track,” he added. 
On the other  hand, the entire train operation on the down track (between Lahore and  Raiwind) remained suspended for several hours, as the rehabilitation of  the track, putting coaches and engine back on the track took time. 
“We  also sent a locomotive to the site that brought all the coaches - other  than the derailed ones - back to the Kot Lakhpat railway station. We did it  in a bid to attach two new coaches and a locomotive with the rake in  order to dispatch the train,” a PR (Lahore Division) spokesman told Dawn.  
He said due to closure of the down track, all Karachi-bound trains were diverted to the up-track from Kahna station.
It  merits mentioning that a number of accidents frequently happened from  2019 to 2022 included many at unmanned crossings in Pakistan. These  included killing of 22, including 20 Sikh pilgrims, in July 2020 after a  train rammed into a bus at Sucha Soda, a small town near  Farooqabad in Sheikhupura district.  
Another similar accident  happened near Pattoki at an unmanned level crossing when a train hit a  car carrying two newly-wed couples who died on the spot. 
Till December 2020, there were 3,000 unmanned  crossings across the country, with 550 in Lahore division which also includes Sheikhupura, Okara and Faisalabad. “At unmanned level crossings, it is, under the law, purely a  responsibility of road users to cross carefully. Law also allows taking  necessary legal action against those crossing a railway track at an  unmanned level crossing in case of an accident,” said an official. 
He said as many as 100 unmanned crossings and unauthorised passages were closed by the PR (Lahore division). 
He  said if any railway servant notices a transport vehicle crossing a  class 3 level crossing without complying with the requirement of section  91 (i) of the West Pakistan Motor Vehicle Ordinance 1965, its number  with available particulars shall immediately be brought to the notice of  the sectional permanent way inspector of railways or the nearest  station master shall promptly report the matter to police. 
“The  driver of a transport vehicle who desires to pass over a railway level  crossing shall cause the vehicle to stop before the crossing and shall  not attempt to pass over the crossing unless permission of the conductor  of the vehicle, or where the vehicle has no conductor, a person  authorised in this behalf by the owner of the vehicle in writing other  than the driver of the vehicle walks before the vehicle until it has  cleared the railway line (sic),” reads section 16.9 of the ordinance. 
He  said similarly as per Railway Act 1890, the responsibility for upgrade  of unmanned level crossing lies with the provincial governments and road  authorities concerned, for whom the ministry of railways may provide  all possible technical assistance.

1,Buzdar says criticising him akin to rapping PTI,LAHORE: Former chief minister of Punjab Sardar Usman Buzdar said on Monday the criticism of him by Chief Minister...,"LAHORE: Former chief minister of Punjab Sardar Usman Buzdar said on Monday the criticism of him by Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi was in fact “the criticism of the narrative of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI).”
“I served the people of the province honestly for over three years. My conscience is satisfied,” said Buzdar responding to the media queries outside an accountability court.
Reporters were keen to seek his comments on the critical remarks by Mr Elahi on the performance of Buzdar government during an interview to a news channel the other day.
Buzdar chose not to respond to Elahi’s remarks, however, claiming that record development projects were launched during his tenure.  
He claimed the governance during his government was good and that it did not resort to victimisation of political rivals. “I always respect friends,” he added.
Buzdar said he kept many secrets in his heart, but the time was not appropriate to reveal them.
In his TV interview, Mr Elahi lashed out at the former chief minister for “discrimination” against Gujrat district, that is former’s constituency, in launching development schemes.
He alleged the Buzdar government ruined the whole province during the last four years.
Earlier, an accountability court extended the interim pre-arrest bail of Mr Buzdar in an inquiry launched by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) against him and others on charges of misuse of authority and corruption in the award of a liquor sale licence to a hotel.
A special NAB prosecutor told the court that a recommendation for closure of the inquiry had been forwarded to the headquarters of the anti-corruption watchdog. Final decision in the matter would be taken by the NAB chairman, he added.  
The court extended Mr Buzdar’s bail till Jan 5, 2023.
The former chief minister pleaded before the court that the inquiry was a result of the NAB’s mala fide. He stated that there was no evidence on record to suggest that he derived any illegal pecuniary advantage or benefit in any manner whatsoever.  
He said no offence was made out against the petitioner for want of arrest under any provision of the National Accountability Ordinance 1999.

Petitioner Namdar Ali submits that Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan announced dissolution of the provincial assemblies of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Dec 23. He says the dissolution of the assemblies would be against the mandate of the Constitution and the autonomy of the provinces.
He states that Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi, in a TV interview, stated his wish that the legislature fulfil its constitutional term, but at the same time claimed to have handed over a summary to Imran Khan for the dissolution of the assembly.
The petitioner alleges that the PTI chairman wants to dissolve the Punjab Assembly for his personal gains, but it would be detrimental to the stability of the country.  
He asks the court to restrain the chief minister from the dissolution of the Punjab assembly in the larger public interest.

3,Curbing smog in Lahore: LHC suggests two-week winter vacation,"Directs Pemra to run smog awareness campaign on TV channels, EPA to monitor smoke-emitting industries.","LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Monday directed a judicial commission to propose to the school education department to announce a two-week long winter vacation in the public and private schools as a step to help curb smog in the provincial capital.
Justice Shahid Karim was hearing public interest petitions filed by Haroon Farooq and others on different environmental issues.
The judge previously ordered closing of the schools on Fridays and Saturdays.
On Monday, the judge directed the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) to run a smog awareness campaign on TV channels.
He also directed the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) to strictly monitor the smoke-emitting industries.
Earlier, the Lahore deputy commissioner submitted a report containing recommendations to mitigate smog.
The report revealed that the Punjab government had already approved a project for procurement of 200 drone cameras under a World Bank-funded programme. It said modern drones with night-vision cameras could be programmed to report smoke emissions even during night time.
The report further stated that long-range PTZ (Pan-Tilt-Zoom) cameras did not require human control and can automatically detect and record certain emissions from up to 3,000 meters distance. It proposed installation of the PTZ cameras at the smog hot spots in Lahore, including Mehmood Booti, Karol Ghati, Lakhodair, Turkey Road, Ring Road, Multan Road and Bund Road.
It also suggested installation of at least ten air quality monitoring stations in the city and increase in the field posts for the better implementation of the government policies.
The report said the Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA) had been focusing more on the ornamental plants, whereas urban green spaces should be used to purify the air and reduce “fugitive dust” in the city.
The judge adjourned the hearing till Dec 23 and directed the provincial government to release funds for the implementation of the report’s suggestions.

6,Cipher audio leak controversy: Imran allowed time to file rejoinder to FIA reply,Call-up notice challenge plea in prohibited funding case adjourned.,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Monday allowed time to a counsel for Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan to file his rejoinder to a reply by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) in an inquiry into an audio leak relating to cipher controversy.
Khan challenged a call-up notice by the agency which was suspended by the court on a previous hearing.  
As Justice Asjad Javed Ghural resumed the hearing, a legal representative of the FIA submitted a reply seeking dismissal of Khan’s petition.
The agency said the call-up notice to the petitioner was issued in accordance with law. It further said that the inquiry was being conducted as per the law and no harassment had been caused to the petitioner.

Call-up notice challenge plea in prohibited funding case adjourned

Khan’s counsel Barrister Salman Safdar sought time to file his rejoinder and the judge adjourned the hearing for a date to be fixed after winter vacation in courts.
In the petition, Barrister Safdar argued that the FIA summoned the petitioner in the impugned inquiry without disclosing any criminal wrongdoing committed by the petitioner.  
He asked the court to set aside the impugned call-up notice by declaring it being issued without jurisdiction. He also urged the court to quash the inquiry in the interest of justice since no wrongdoing whatsoever had been pointed out against the petitioner.
Justice Ghural also adjourned hearing of another petition of Khan challenging a call-up notice in an inquiry in the prohibited funding case.
The judge had on Nov 8 suspended the impugned notice.
Khan through Advocate Intizar Hussain Panjhuta contended that the FIA had no power to proceed in the matter, especially when the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) did not even hold that any law had been violated in opening or operating the bank accounts in question.  
He said the ECP never directed the FIA or any other agency to inquire into any aspect of the bank accounts. He argued that only the federal government and the ECP could take actions against the political parties.
The FIA, in its reply, defended the call-up notice saying it was competent to investigate offences taking place in private banks. It said the inquiry was relating to bank accounts about which the PTI claimed before the ECP that the accounts were opened without an authorisation of the party.

8,Farmers hold ‘tractor march’ in Lahore today,"They are demanding regulation of Urea market, issuance of DAP subsidy, higher support prices for wheat and sugarcane.","LAHORE: Farmers are holding a “tractor march” in the provincial capital on Tuesday (today) to press the Parvez Elahi government for acceptance of their demands related to regulating the Urea fertiliser market, issuance of DAP subsidy and higher support prices for wheat and sugarcane.
Kissan Ittehad president Mian Umair Masood will lead the march against failure of the Punjab government in meeting their demands despite promises.
Farmers claim that Parliamentary Affairs Minister Raja Basharat had assured the representatives of the Ittehad recently that the government would take strict action against hoarders of Urea fertiliser, which was being sold at Rs3,200 per 50kg bag against the official rate of Rs2,250 per bag.
The provincial government had also not begun releasing the subsidy on DAP so far, nor it fixed wheat support price on a par with the Sindh government, which fixed it at Rs4,000 per 40kg.
Likewise, they had demanded Rs370 per maund support price of sugarcane, but the government had yet to take any step in this regard, while sugar millers have allegedly been given a free hand to purchase cane from the growers through simple paper slips instead of proper cane purchase receipt (CPR), as required under the law, they said.

GCU Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Asghar Zaidi constituted various assessment teams comprising senior professors from different universities to review the implementation of 31 standards of the self-assessment programme under the Higher Education Commission (HEC) guidelines.
A separate team has been constituted for quality assessment of every department of the university.  
“The assessments will also contribute towards ranking of the departments and the top ranked one will be awarded cash prize and certificates for the faculty members.”
Prof Zaidi visited the botany department, along with the assessment team, and reviewed laboratory equipment, library resources and other research facilities made available to the students, besides faculty-to-student ratio, the standards of research and teaching, training offered to support staff in previous years, curriculum design and improvement etc.
The VC said the basic objective of the self-assessment initiative was to identify areas where further improvement could be made by identifying weaknesses in each department of the university. He said a plan would be chalked out to bring continuous improvements and convert the weaknesses identified by the teams into strengths to set an example for other universities.
He said self-assessment was a technical and systematic process of gathering and reviewing important quantitative and qualitative data and information from multiple and diverse sources about educational programmes.
He also said senior academicians from other varsities had also been included in the self-assessment teams to ensure impartiality.
He appreciated the staff and faculty of the GCU’s botany department for extending cooperation to the assessment team.
