• Rana Sana wants separate FIR against PTI chief for anti-Shuhada campaign
• Fawad clears difference between real threat and legal action
• Police security from Imran’s residence withdrawn, Shireen alleges
ISLAMABAD: Former prime minister Imran Khan was booked in a terrorism case on Sunday for “threatening” a female judge and senior police officers in a public rally that drew strong reaction from the federal government with the interior minister declaring that the PTI chief would not be allowed to challenge the writ of the state by inciting rebellion.
Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah said he had already recommended a separate case against Mr Khan for the “derogatory” campaign against Shuhada (martyrs) of Pakistan Army.
However, senior leader of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Fawad Chaudhry at a presser questioned the government move by screening a video of Mr Sanaullah to draw a comparison between a “real threat” and “taking a legal course of action” against someone. 
Also, senior PTI leader Shireen Mazari came up with the claim that the Islamabad police had withdrawn security from Mr Khan and his residence since Saturday evening. 
In his address on Saturday evening, Mr Khan had threatened to file cases against Islamabad’s inspector general of police and deputy inspector general of police and declared: “We won’t spare you.” He then warned the judiciary against its “biased” attitude towards his party, saying that it should brace itself for the consequences. He also warned additional district and sessions judge Zeba Chaudhry, who had approved two-day physical remand of Mr Khan’s aide Shahbaz Gill’s on the request of the capital police, that she would also face dire consequences. 
The First Investigation Report (FIR) was registered at the Margalla police station on a complaint of a judicial magistrate, Ali Javed, under Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act.
“Imran’s speech spread fear and uncertainty among the police, judges and the nation,” the FIR said with the request for legal action against Imran and an “exemplary punishment”. It reproduced the PTI chairman’s remarks about the female judge and the Islamabad police officials. It was pleaded in the FIR that the public address was meant to “terrorise” top police officials and the judiciary so they could not perform their functions and abstain from pursuing any action against PTI leaders if required to do so.
Earlier in the day, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah said he had already recommended a separate case against Mr Khan for the “derogatory” campaign against Shuhada (martyrs) of Pakistan Army.
He said he had recommended at a previous meeting of the federal cabinet that a separate FIR should be filed against Mr Khan for bashing of army and Shuhada but at time a committee was formed to decide about it. “I think the next cabinet meeting will make a decision on it as well,” he added.
“The government was holding legal consultations with allies on whether to file a separate case against PTI Chairman Imran Khan for his provocative speech a day ago or nominate him in a previous case,” he added.
‘Orchestrated campaign’
“This is all happening in continuation — from a campaign after Lasbela incident when six army officers were martyred, followed by Gill’s attempt to incite army ranks to go against their top command and then Imran threatening a woman judge and police officials for performing their duties as per the law,” the minister said. He earlier tweeted, “Imran Niazi will have to face the law for threatening and hurling abuses at the magistrate and police officers. Such acts of brazen thuggery are responsible for instigating extremism in society. You [IK] are not allowed to challenge the writ of the state by inciting rebellion.”
Responding to a question about PTI’s possible reaction to the FIR against Mr Khan, the interior minister said: “The Constitution has a clear way to deal with law breakers and we will follow the procedure. Taking 10,000 to 12,000 people to Islamabad from Punjab and other places will not be a big deal. We will handle them, if they come.”
Evidence 
While rejecting the allegation that Mr Gill had been tortured in custody, the interior minister termed it a “drama” just to divert attention from his anti-state remarks made on ARY News and the campaign over Lasbela helicopter crash. 
Mr Sanaullah said his ministry had “proof in the form of a telephonic conversation” allegedly revealing Mr Gill’s understanding with ARY News workers about uninterrupted 14-minute airtime to be given to him for speaking against the army.
“How could he provoke army officers to disobey the orders of their top command?” he asked.
He said Mr Gill termed a tier of certain officers as patriotic and labelled the “top command as unpatriotic”.
The interior minister ruled out the PTI claims that their party leader was assaulted as well as sexually abused during custody. He said Mr Gill remained in police custody from Aug 9-11 and subsequently he was sent on judicial remand for six days till Aug 17. “Not a single complaint was filed by him about torture and his condition deteriorated only after his remand was extended on Aug 17,” he said.
He then alleged that Mr Khan, while sitting in the PM Office, had planned torturing of a senior journalist Mohsin Baig, he himself (Rana Sanaullah) and a woman Tayyaba Gul for complaining against former National Accountability Bureau (NAB) chairman Javed Iqbal. “Imran used her video tape to get benefit from NAB and kept the woman in the PM House for over a month illegally,” he added.  
Later, PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry said the government was labouring under the belief that “closed rooms” could save it from the nation’s wrath.
He told a presser in Islamabad that how the interior minister had supposedly made controversial statements in Punjab Assembly and questioned how Mr Sanaullah was being “tolerated”.
Mr Chaudhry played down the allegations that the ex-premier had threatened Islamabad police and the woman judge by showing a video clip of the interior minister to “draw a comparison” between what makes a real threat and a legal course of action against someone.
‘Security withdrawn’
Another PTI leader Shireen Mazari said the Islamabad police had withdrawn security from Mr Khan and his residence since Saturday evening. “This is against the law but who cares about law in this ‘imported’ government. Nation should know how conspirators are creating a life threat for Imran Khan,” she tweeted.
Earlier while responding to warnings issued by Mr Khan against the police, the Islamabad Capital Territory Police (ICT) stated: “Anyone threatening the police or making false accusations will be dealt with according to the law.
“All officers are rendering their services with complete responsibility and continue to discharge them. The police is an organised institution and we are bound to perform our duties come what may,” the ICT police said.

1,PTI chief alleges ‘neutrals’ behind crackdown on party,"Ex-PM alleges ""neutrals pressurised police"" to give PTI workers a thrashing on May 25.","ISLAMABAD: Former prime minister Imran Khan on Sunday levelled a series of allegations against the ‘neutrals’ — a term he uses to allude to the military establishment — saying as per the “information he received from insiders” they were the ones who were allegedly responsible for the ongoing crackdown on the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI). 
Addressing a political gathering at Rawalpindi’s Liaquat Bagh, the PTI chairman said that with this gathering he had started the journey to achieve “real freedom” for the country and he would not rest until he has achieved his goal.
“On May 25, when the police used violence against us, I was told by insiders that the police were ordered from above, which means that neutrals pressurised them to give PTI workers a thrashing,” Mr Khan said and questioned whether the “neutrals were really neutral”. 
Speaking about the disqualification case against him in the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), the PTI chairman alleged: “The chief election commission[er] is giving every decision against us … I got information from the inside that he [the CEC] was not doing anything on his own but there was pressure from above.” 

Ex-PM alleges ‘neutrals pressurised police’ to give PTI workers a thrashing on May 25; PTI leaders condemn ‘disruption of YouTube service’ during Imran’s speech 

Mr Khan alleged that the police also said that they were not responsible for the torture of his aide Shahbaz Gill as they did not and it happened after “orders from behind”. “They [police] are also pointing fingers towards you… whenever anything wrong happens in Pakistan, you are blamed for it,” the PTI chief added.
The former prime minister said he wanted to ask the powers-that-be if “they were neutral or not”. 
Mr Khan further accused the authorities of harassing visitors to Banigala, his residence in Islamabad, and said the people who came to meet him “received calls from the intelligence agencies”. 
“I want to ask whether you are neutral or not. If you stand with these people [PDM government], will the nation stop thinking of them as thieves,” he asked. Mr Khan alleged that a certain Mr Y has come to Islamabad…I know what their plan is,” he claimed, alleging that the government wanted to get rid of him by putting him in jail and sideline the PTI. 
According to Imran Khan, PTI was the “biggest party at the federal level” and any attempts to break the party would hurt the country. “Political parties are the glue that keeps the country together,” he said.
The former premier spent the first half of his speech on why he was ousted from power. He claimed that he was removed because he wanted to bring independent foreign policy. 
Talking about his Chief of Staff Shahbaz Gill, Mr Khan said that Shehbaz Gill was kidnapped and tortured to give a statement against him. The former premier called out the sessions judge who sent Mr Gill on physical remand despite alleged torture, saying, “Magistrate Zeba, when a man was brought to you after [alleged] torture, you handed him over to the police again… did you do justice as a judge?” 
YouTube blackout
According to Dawn.com, YouTube services in parts of the country reportedly faced disruptions during Imran Khan’s speech. It may be mentioned here that his live addresses were banned on TV channels on Saturday night by the electronic media regulator in light of his controversial remarks about judges and police officials. 
The PTI issued a condemnation and noted that “coincidentally, YouTube was back to being fully operational as soon as our historic rally finished.” “Freedom of expression is completely finished in Pakistan,” it added.
PTI leader Shireen Mazari also condemned the censorship and said, “Regime change conspirators [are] so scared of Imran Khan that today in the middle of [his] speech they blocked YouTube through PTA. Shameful! 

 





 
This will not silence us. Fascism at its peak as fear overwhelms the cabal of crooks and their string pullers!” PTI leader Hammad Azhar also lashed out at the authorities for the “crackdown on freedom of speech”.
In a late-night development, a heavy contingent of police reached outside the Banigala residence of Imran Khan and erected barricades to stop PTI workers from proceeding to his house, as media reports suggested that after the conclusion of his Liaquat Bagh rally there was a possibility that he could be arrested under a non-bailable case registered against him at Margalla police station.  
However, there were unclear reports about his whereabouts.  
According to some reports, Mr Khan did not return to his hilltop house after the public meeting and stayed at an undisclosed location in Rawalpindi. 
But PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry told Dawn that Mr Khan was at his residence and thousands of party workers and his followers had gathered outside and were holding protest against the registration of FIR against him. “Khan sahib is inside and thousands of workers are gathering outside,” he added.

3,PML-N seeks judicial probe into April 16 PA ‘mayhem’,Party's chief whip says judicial commission needed to investgate episode and punish MPAs who tortured deputy speaker.,"LAHORE: The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) has demanded the formation of a judicial commission to investigate the April 16 mayhem in the Punjab Assembly being used by the provincial government as an excuse to arrest its leaders. 
At a press conference here on Sunday, PML-N chief whip Khalil Tahir Sindhu said the commission was needed to probe the clash during the Punjab Assembly proceedings (on April 16) and penalise those MPAs who tortured the deputy speaker conducting election to the office of chief minister under a Lahore High Court order. 
A video footage of the assembly proceedings was also screened on the occasion in which ruling PTI parliamentarians could be seen attacking Dost Mohammad Mazari and dragging him by hair. 
Mr Sindhu alleged that then speaker Parvez Elahi planned and instructed the ruling coalition’s members to assault the deputy speaker and clash with the police, which came to rescue Mr Mazari on the latter’s request as the assembly’s own security looked the other way under the pressure of the speaker. 
He alleged that “wanted criminals from Gujrat”, hometown of Mr Elahi, were seated in the Visitors’ Gallery though there was a ban on allowing entry to any outsider to the assembly’s galleries on that day, and that these goons thrashed the police and PML-N lawmakers. 
He said Mr Elahi had planned to get ink thrown at the Punjab chief secretary and inspector-general of police by insisting on summoning the two officers to the assembly chamber on the excuse that they should tender apologies to the MPAs for trespassing the assembly. 
He alleged that as chief minister Mr Elahi was being used by PTI chairman Imran Khan to hound and harass the PML-N leaders and feared that he (Sindhu) could be implicated in a ‘false’ case and detained within a couple of days. He regretted that the incumbent IGP had withdrawn security of the Model Town secretariat of the PML-N. 
Mr Sindhu chided the PTI chairman for what he said humiliating and threatening a judge and police in his Islamabad speech on Saturday.
He said though his party had reservations about the Supreme Court chief justice, it hoped that the CJP would take a suo motu action against Mr Khan for the sake of protecting the institution of judiciary. “Save the judiciary otherwise the judges will stop working (in the wake of threats by the PTI).” 
The PML-N leader also criticised Imran Khan for the latter’s statement on Salman Rushdie and urged him to sue the foreign paper which, as per the former prime minister’s claim, quoted him out of contest on the issue. 
Mr Sindhu alleged that foreign companies had provided funds to Imran Khan under a conspiracy to bleed the national economy and lead it to default like Sri Lanka. 
He said the PTI chairman could be sentenced for over 300 years if tried in a foreign country for illegal funding. He told a questioner that PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif would return by October and would lead the party’s election campaign.

4,"In major boost, PTI wins Karachi by-election","According to unofficial results, PTI's Mahmood Maulvi secured 29,475 votes, defeating MQM-P’s Moeed Anwar who bagged 13,193 votes.","KARACHI: Marred by low turnout amid least interest of voters, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) won the by-election of Karachi’s NA-245 on Sunday and retained its mandate from the constituency in a major boost to the party a week before the local bodies’ elections in the city giving setback to the key contestant Muttahida Qaumi Movement Pakistan (MQM-P) which was enjoying the support of the ruling parties at the Centre. 
According to unofficial results, Mahmood B. Maulvi of PTI won the by-election by securing 29,475 votes, defeating MQM-P’s Moeed Anwar who bagged 13,193 votes. Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan’s (TLP) Mohammad Ahmed Raza came third with 9,836 votes. Dr Farooq Sattar, the disgruntled leader of MQM-P and founder of MQM restoration committee who was contesting as an independent candidate, also failed to make any impact and managed to secure only 3,479 votes.  

Polling marred by low turnout amid least interest of voters

The fresh win for the PTI in Karachi came amid growing tension between the opposition party and the government earlier in the day, with the latter registering a case against former prime minister Imran Khan under the Anti-Terrorism Act for threatening an additional sessions judge and senior police officers of the Islamabad police at a rally in Islamabad’s F-9 Park on Saturday night. The win boosted the confidence of the PTI to flex its muscles amid speculation of possible arrest of Mr Khan, with the party warning that any move to put the former prime minister behind bars would evoke strong reaction from the party’s workers.
“The result of NA-245 proves that the people of Pakistan are behind Imran Khan. If the imported government makes any foolish move to arrest Imran Khan, I fear the people of Pakistan would block the whole country,” tweeted former federal minister and the party’s Sindh chapter president Ali Zaidi with an image of the FIR lodged against Mr Khan a couple of hours before the official result of the by-election was announced. 



 
Earlier, the nine-hour-long polling exercise in 263 polling stations of the constituency continued without any break, but it failed to attract voters in large numbers.
The first half of the day witnessed deserted camps of the contesting parties and only a few hours before the cut-off time of voting  did the polling stations start to fill up. 
Unlike the June 2022 by-election in NA-240 constituency in the city’s Korangi area, the polling in NA-245 remained peaceful with a few episodes of tensions and scuffles between workers of contesting parties and complaints. Meanwhile, there were also sporadic recriminations about code of conduct  violations. 
The June 16 by-election in NA-240 was not only marred by low turnout, but also exposed mismanagement on part of the ECP and the poor performance of law enforcement agencies.
Armed attacks, clashes between workers of rival parties and assaults on election camps had left one man dead and over a dozen injured.
