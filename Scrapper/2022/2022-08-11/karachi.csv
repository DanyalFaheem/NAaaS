1,"For first time, Sindh PA fails to meet for 100 days in parliamentary year",Sindh Assembly remained in session for 71 days during year ending tomorrow.,"KARACHI: For the first time in the past many years, the Sindh Assembly met for less than 100 working days in the current parliamentary years.
While the Rules of Procedure of the Provincial Assembly clearly stated that “the house shall meet for not less than one hundred working days in each parliamentary year”, it remained in session for just 71 days in the current parliamentary year ending on Aug 12 (tomorrow).
The rules for sittings of the assembly says, “There shall be at least three sessions of the assembly in a parliamentary year and not more than 120 days shall intervene between the last sitting of the assembly in one session and the date appointed for its first sitting in the next session.”
Sub-rule 1 of Rule 28 of the Rules of Procedure said: “Provided that the Assembly shall meet for not less than one hundred working days in each parliamentary year.”

Sindh Assembly remained in session for 71 days during year ending tomorrow

The Sindh Assembly had a reputation of following the rule as it had remained in session for 100 days even during the Covid-19 pandemic.
In the first parliamentary year of the current tenure that began in 2018, the provincial assembly remained in session for 130 days, 101 days in the second parliamentary year and 100 days in the third parliamentary year. However, it remained in session for only 71 days in the fourth parliamentary year.
The assembly also failed to meet as per the schedule given in the assembly rules, which stated that the assembly shall meet for not less than 15 days in June, not less than 12 days in September and December, and not less than seven days in August, October, November, January, February, April and May.
Similarly, the Sindh Assembly did not observe the timings of sittings from 10am to 2pm as per the assembly rules.
All sittings of the assembly sessions during the current parliamentary year started with a considerable delay of over one hour. Only one sitting could begin with a delay of half an hour.
While the first spell of monsoon rain began on July 4, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Mukesh Kumar Chawla told Dawn that the assembly could not meet for 100 days as per assembly rules mainly due to devastating rains of monsoon season. 
“All the assembly members belonging to the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party and provincial cabinet members remained in field in their respective areas during the rains as directed by the party leadership,” he said, adding that it was impossible for the members to attend the assembly sitting as they were engaged in relief and rehabilitation work.
“There has been 180 per cent more rain during this monsoon season,” he said.
Mr Chawla recalled that there were still 60 days to meet in the current parliamentary year when the assembly session was summoned on June 14, but, he pointed out, sessions had to be adjourned three times for 10 days due to rain emergency.
Opposition Leader Haleem Adil Sheikh said that it was a failure on part of the provincial government that it could not ensure the meeting of the assembly for 100 days as required by the assembly laws. 
“Their [provincial government] seriousness in legislation can be judged from the lone fact that the assembly did not meet for the required days,” he added.
Mr Sheikh said that the PPP’s provincial government had turned the house into an ‘autaq’ for feudal lords, where house business was not carried out as per law and assembly rules.

2,Karachi fishermen save ‘Chinese’ man struggling to stay afloat in sea,Rescued man handed over to Pakistan Maritime Security Agency.,"KARACHI: A group of fishermen belonging to Ibrahim Hyderi saved the life of a seemingly Chinese individual on Wednesday morning while out on a fishing expedition just outside the creek areas of the city.
The Pakistani fishermen on board their fishing trawler, Al-Madina, spotted a bright orange object floating at a little distance from them at 9:30am. On using their binoculars they realised that it was a person wearing a life jacket floating in the water.
The boat captain, Haji Abdullah, then turned the direction of his boat towards the person. The fishermen threw in their fishing nets to save him. They pulled him out with the help of their nets.
“It turned out to be an extremely tired and exhausted Chinese man. Well, he looked Chinese and what he was saying, though he couldn’t talk much, also sounded like Chinese. He had been swimming in the water for quite a while. Perhaps he fell off a deep fishing trawler owned by some Chinese company. It looks like he had been there in the water since Tuesday night trying to keep himself afloat,” Kamal Shah of the Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum (PFF) told Dawn.
“The man seemed too disoriented and unable to understand things. He was given a blanket to keep him warm and boxes of fruit juice to help him get his lost energy back but he didn’t drink much.
“He was also given a mobile phone in case he would like to call anyone to let them know that he was fine. But he just tossed it to one side. Then the boat captain also called the Pakistan Maritime Security Agency to hand him over to them. They came on their boat and took him into their custody,” the PFF spokesman informed.
Upon the return of the fishermen to Jamote Jetty in Ibrahim Hyderi, they were all greeted by PFF chairman Mehr Ali Shah, who congratulated them for saving a life.

3,"No relief from loadshedding in Karachi, even on Ashura",Prolonged outages compel people to spend sleepless night.,"KARACHI: Prolonged spells of loadshedding that has become order of the day in the city over the past few months continued even on Ashura, piling miseries on people, especially the mourners, as majalis at several places were affected due to power disruption, it emerged on Wednesday.  
Reports pouring in from almost every part of the city suggested that the K-Electric instead of giving any relief on 9th and 10th of Muharram carried out loadshedding for six to 12 hours in several parts of metropolis, including the areas that had been declared ‘exempted’ by the power utility.  
Residents of different localities said that the loadshedding was carried out in every part of the city regardless of the so-called high and low losses areas declared by the KE.  
Participants in the main Ashura procession from across the city spent a sleepless night when they got homes to suffer one-hour loadshedding at least three times at night-time.  

Prolonged outages compel people to spend sleepless night

A resident of Model Colony said that loadshedding was being carried out in the entire area from 1am to 2am and 3am to 4am regularly. “There was no respite in loadshedding even on Ashura,” he deplored.  
Another resident of Rizvia Society said that traditionally loadshedding was not carried out on 9th and 10 of Muharram in the past. “But this year, the KE did not spare people of ordeal of loadshedding during the two mourning days,” he added.  
The people also expressed their concern on loadshedding on 9th and 10th Muharram as the two days were closed holidays.  
“The KE resorted to worst loadshedding during the days of mourning when there has to be a lesser gap between demand and supply of electricity,” said Mazhar Shah, a resident of Gulshan Iqbal’s 13-D block.  
Residents of Malir said that they rented power generators for uninterrupted supply to hold majalis during Ashura.  
They said that the majalis held at small scale at houses were badly affected due to unannounced and prolonged loadshedding as there was a severe shortage of generators available for rent.  
The areas affected by unannounced loadshedding included Gulshan-i-Iqbal, Gulistan-i-Jauhar, Surjani Town, New Karachi, Federal B Area, F. C Area, Azizabad, Saddar, Burns Road, Defence Housing Authority, Clifton, Baldia Town, Manghopir, Orangi Town, Landhi, Shah Faisal Colony, Model Colony, Shaheed-i-Millat, Tariq Road, PECHS, Mehmoodabad, Akhtar Colony and Defence View apartments, Jamshed Road, Sultanabad and Hijrat Colony.

5,Opening up the arts to everyone,Tickets of three theatrical productions to be played this month are beyond the reach of most people...,"KARACHI: Recently, Britain’s deputy leader of the opposition and deputy leader of the Labour Party Angela Rayner went to see Mozart’s The Marriage of Figaro at Glyndenbourne. The Deputy Prime Minister of the country, Dominic Raab, found it opportune to take a dig at her and called her a ‘champagne socialist’. Ms Rayner in response said: “My advice to the deputy PM is to cut out the snobbery and brush up on his opera. The Marriage of Figaro is the story of a working-class woman who gets the better of a privileged but dim-witted villain… Judging by his own performance today, Dominic Raab could learn a lesson about opening up the arts to everyone, whatever their background.”
Ms Rayner in her reply made a point — opening up the arts to everyone — that those associated with the arts in Pakistan, particularly in Karachi, which has been the cultural hub of the country for a few decades at least in terms of the regularity with which art-related activities take place here, must take note of. 
In a society that is increasingly moving towards a non-reading culture, the performing arts can be a wonderful source of inculcating ideas. Plus, they engender tenderness in human beings. In that regard, the big question that springs to mind is: are the arts readily accessible to the people? 

Tickets of three theatrical productions to be played this month are beyond the reach of most people

In this month alone, weather permitting, three theatrical productions will see the light of day in the city — one at the Arts Council, another at the National Academy of Performing Arts (Napa) and one more, in the English language which was staged in Lahore last month, is travelling to Karachi in late August. 
What is their target audience? To be honest, each falls into a different category — a political satire laced with humour, a piece extracted from ancient texts and a story of a couple. Therefore, it is difficult to ascertain who is going to see what drama. The conjecture is that scripts written in a lighter vein usually produce more eagerness in audiences. But wouldn’t it be wonderful if a large section of people, in the Pakistani context, watched all kinds of stuff? After all, art reflects life. It is education. 
Now, there are a couple of issues here, the first of which is affordability. A friend told this writer that he wanted to see one of the aforementioned plays with his wife. When he inquired about the tickets, it turned out that buying them would be beyond his means. Ah, the villain known as inflation!
Then where do they advertise/market these productions? Answer: mostly on social media… and in English. This is a clear indication that they have a certain section of society in mind — those who can afford to spend oodles of money and those who can, arguably, feign intellectual superiority.
One is aware that it is not an easy subject to broach. After all, producers of big theatrical performances need assurances of different kinds — monetary, moral, artistic etc — to keep going. Still, since artists are thought to be a liberated lot, they say, liberty means responsibility.

6,ECP issued notice on plea against postponement of local govt elections,KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Wednesday issued notices to the Election Commission of Pakistan and others on a...,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Wednesday issued notices to the Election Commission of Pakistan and others on a petition of the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) against postponement of the second phase of local government (LG) elections in Sindh.
JI-Karachi chief Hafiz Naeem ur Rehman, who is also contesting the election on a union committee chairman, and another party candidate have petitioned the SHC stating that the LG polls were postponed with mala fide intention and sought a directive for the ECP to announce an early date for holding elections.
When a two-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Ahmed Ali M. Shaikh took up the matter for hearing, the counsel for petitioners argued that the ballot papers had been handed over to presiding officers before the postponement of the elections and they had no idea about their current status.
The counsel further submitted that Karachi Administrator Murtaza Wahab was a political person and was allegedly providing government machinery and funds to the candidates of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) to promote and build their campaign and image.
The bench remarked that two major cities of province had received heavy rain on July 24, as forecasted, and there would have been hardly any turnout if the polls were held on the earlier scheduled date.
The court put the ECP, provincial election commissioner, Sindh chief secretary and federal and provincial law officers on notice with a direction to file comments on the next hearing.
The petitioners submitted that the four-year tenure of the previously elected local governments in Sindh had expired on Aug 30, 2020, and instead of holding elections, the provincial government had appointed administrators across the province.
They maintained that initially, the Sindh government had deliberately delayed the delimitation process by not providing the details and required maps of union committees, while the ECP was bound to hold elections within 120 days after the end of the tenure of the previous local body government.
Thereafter, the petitioners submitted that the provincial government had provided the data after the ECP had issued a warning.
The JI had serious reservations over voter list and the delimitation, which was carried out totally on political grounds to provide maximum benefit to the ruling party in Sindh, but still it welcomed the LG elections, they added.
They argued that the ECP had postponed the elections just three days before the second phase which were scheduled to be held on July 24 in Karachi and Hyderabad divisions, and fixed Aug 28 as the new date for polling.
The petitioners contended that the reasons incorporated in the impugned notification of the ECP to postpone the LG elections were ‘lame excuses’ having no base.
They submitted that the ECP had cited Muharram and forecast of heavy rain as reasons to delay the elections, but the Met office had been issuing such forecasts for the past two months, and only five per cent of such forecasts were found correct while Muharram was starting six days after the scheduled date of elections.
They further submitted that on June 24, the SHC had also dismissed the petitions of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan seeking postponement of the LG election and ruled that no case for staying the elections was made out by the petitioners.
The petitioners also pleaded to set aside the impugned notification and for publication of fresh ballot papers with different colours to avoid malpractice and rigging.
It may be recalled that a PTI candidate had also filed an identical petition last month and the SHC had issued notices to the ECP and other respondents for Aug 11 (today), but also directed the lawyer for the petitioner to satisfy it about the maintainability of the petition.

Hyderabad deputy commissioner Fuad Ghaffar Soomro, who was handed over charge of director general of HDA on June 10, approached LG secretary, seeking his intervention for return of the HDA’s expensive vehicles.
The vehicles were currently in use of Sindh government officers including a provincial secretary, ex-HDA DGs and secretaries, for they were adamant not to return the vehicles while taking advantage of their respective official positions. 
The DC has even sought disciplinary proceedings through Chief Secretary of Sindh for the retrieval of the vehicles. 
DG HDA confirmed having appro­ached LG secretary after officers concerned did not return the vehicles to HDA which was in need of them.
The vehicles included a 2022 model vehicle worth close to Rs10m which outgoing DG HDA Mohammad Sohail had taken away after purchasing it during his brief stint as DG of cash-strapped HDA. Sohail was now posted in Malir Development Authority (MDA).
Besides him, 10 other officers were supposed to return the vehicles, who included Sindh secretary forests Dr Badar Jamil Mendro, director general of Sehwan Development Authority Ghulam Mohammad Kaimkhani, former secretaries of HDA Sajjad Memon, Waseem Mustafa Soomro, Dr Asghar Abbas, former managing director of Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) Agha Abdul Raheem, former deputy director of Wasa audit & accounts Mohammad Waseem Shaikh and Rehmatullah Shaikh, former LG minister’s secretary. Former DG HDA late Ali Ahmed Loond’s name was also on the list.
Sohail was using Fortuner 2022 (GSF-439), Kaimkhani (GSE-179) Altis Corolla; Dr Badar Jamil Terious 200 (BF-0659); Agha Abdul Rahim GL-2010 Suzuki jeep; Wasim Shaikh GS-0274 Toyota Corolla, Rehmatullah Shaikh, Suzuki Cultus (BNX-940).
The DG has informed LG secretary that these officers were allowed to use vehicles as per their entitlement but after their transfer they took away the vehicles with them without returning these to HDA, putting the authority at a great disadvantage.
The DG informed that HDA was supplying water and ensuring disposal of sewerage in entire district besides handling housing related issues. HDA officers mostly performed field work in view of their job description and officers were feeling helpless in performance of their duties due to shortage of vehicles for field work.
He informed that financial position of HDA was not sound enough to purchase new vehicles for officers. “Salaries to employees are not paid for months,” he said. 
He said that HDA tried its best to convince officers to return HDA vehicles through correspondence and telephonic contacts but they were adamant not to return the vehicles taking advantage of their position.
He said that HDA was supposed to put its request before these officers gently but it was being taken as weakness of the authority. Since the officers, the DG explained, had since been transferred from HDA to other government departments.
He urged LG secretary to bring it into the notice of Chief Secretary Sindh and ensure return of the vehicles to HDA through him besides initiating disciplinary proceedings against the officers concerned for their refusal to hand back the vehicles.
