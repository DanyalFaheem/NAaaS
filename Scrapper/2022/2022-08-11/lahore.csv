They say that earlier the PTV and radio used to hold programmes for instrumentalists, but now no such programmes are held. Only arts councils hold festivals occasionally, but the ratio of such programmes is less than the singing concerts.
Zohaib Hassan, Sarangi player, Naushad Ali, flute player, and Saleem Khan, Sitar player, said that though arts councils hold music instrument classes, what is needed is to promote instrumental music on a bigger scale and make it popular like singing concerts. They said that only the Lahore Arts Council holds such events; similarly, other institutions should also come up with such instrument performance festivals.
Sarangi players say the Sarangi is on the verge of decline and hardly four to five Sarangi players are left in the country; such music instruments should be promoted through festivals.
Naushad has been playing the flute for over three decades. He says that instrumental music festivals are the need of the hour. 
“In the West, they often hold such festivals and the flute, to him, is the most affordable music instrument,” he said. 
“Musicians and instrumentalists should also be given ample opportunity to perform singularly at such festival exclusively designed for the instrumental music.” 
The flute is a thousand of years old musical instrument, but not a single festival is organised to celebrate the popular musical instrument. He said the same goes for other traditional musical instruments. 
The Punjab Institute of Language, Art and Culture will hold an instrumental music festival in the near future. 
Director General Dr Sughra Sadaf told Dawn the institute will hold an instrumental music festival, especially on the musical instruments which are on the verge of decline.

Senior lawyers Khan Zahoor Ahmad Iqbal and Chaudhry Ghulam Mustafa Sadiq have been struggling for the last more than four years for the establishment of the banking court at the district complex as there are nearly 60pc of the total cases of the Sahiwal division are from Okara bar. The lawyers are bound to appear in the banking court in Sahiwal, which costs heavily to the litigants.  
The banking court has been recommended by the Lahore High Court (LHC). As 916 cases pertaining to Okara district are pending with court, the chief justice desired the establishment of an independent banking court in Okara under section 5(5) of Financial Institutions (Recovery of Finance) Ordinance 2001. The law secretary was requested to take necessary steps in the aforementioned matter in the public interest. 
A banking court was operational in Sahiwal but it was shifted to Multan in 2001. The DBA Sahiwal with consistent efforts succeeded in reestablishment of the court in October 2015.  
DBA president Amjad Pervaiz Chaudhry and Secretary Mehr Zamir Haider Mangan through MNA Chaudhry Riazul Haq Juj have approached Federal Law Minister Azam Nazir Tarrar to get the recommendations of the LHC implemented.

6,"Parvez lifts ban on timing condition for shops, markets in Punjab",Business centres can now be opened on Sundays.,"LAHORE: The Parvez Elahi government on Wednesday withdrew former chief minister Hamza Shehbaz decision of closing business centres, markets, super stores and shops at 9pm made to conserve electricity and fuel.
The Punjab government has notified the announcement by Chief Minister Parvez Elahi to lift the ban on the timing condition on business centres, markets, super stores and shops.
The Punjab labour and human resource department issued the notification while withdrawing notifications issued on June 18, 20 and 24, and July 1 and 28 that had fixed the closing hours of shops and establishments with immediate effect and till further orders. 
Business centres can now also be opened on Sundays.
The PML-N-led provincial government’s decision had come a day after the Sindh government announced similar austerity measures to conserve electricity and fuel.
The Hamza administration had taken the decision in line with the nine-party coalition government’s measures to deal with the power shortage in the country. 
Speaking to traders, Mr Elahi announced that the government would also resolve parking issues to provide relief to them. 
The chief minister stated in a tweet: “The PML-N patronized parking mafia and I know well the patrons and how much the person earned”.
Mr Elahi asserted that he would eliminate the parking mafia and spend 30 per cent of parking fees on providing facilities to traders.
He said the PML-N made huge propaganda that with the arrival of the Shehbaz government things would change. He said nothing changed and instead the Shehbaz government brought a massive price hike and put a heavy burden on traders.
Mr Elahi also announced setting up Rescue 1122 centres in markets. A committee under the headship of minister Mian Aslam Iqbal and trader leader Nasir Salman was constituted to resolve the problems of the traders.
The chief minister said the Punjab government would adhere to the vision of “Prosperous Trader and Punjab”.
PTI secretary-general Asad Umer lauded CM Parvez Elahi that during his previous tenure as chief minister, he had done a lot of commendable work than others in Punjab and was praised in Pakistan due to his appreciable performance.
He said traders had to face difficulties due to the corona disease and other problems in the past few years and it was the government’s responsibility to resolve the problems of the traders’ community.
Focal person of PTI chairman for traders Nasir Salman said the government wanted to introduce an idea of “downtown”’ and kiosk in the markets like in the developed countries, adding that the markets of all cities should be brought equal to the world subsequently so that the buyer could be persuaded for shopping. He stated that PTI was endeavouring to eradicate poverty by promoting trade. He vowed to resolve the problems of the traders on a priority basis.
Former federal minister Shafqat Mahmood, provincial ministers Dr Yasmin Rashid, Mian Aslam Iqbal, Mian Mahmoodur Rasheed, Mohsin Leghari and Hanif Patafi, Inspector General of Police Faisal Shahkar, Principal Secretary to Chief Minister Muhammad Khan Bhatti, Chairman P&D, ACS (Home) administrative secretaries of departments concerned and senior officials were present.

10,PML-N consults allies on NA by-poll,"The by-polls on NA-157 (Multan) will be held on Sept 11, and NA-108 (Faisalabad) and NA-118 (Nankana Sahib) on Sept 25.","LAHORE: The PML-N has finalised consultation with its allies, mainly the PPP and the JUI-F, on award of tickets for by-election on three National Assembly seats in Punjab, with one seat going to the party of Bhuttos and other to the Sharifs.  
The by-polls on NA-157 (Multan) will be held on Sept 11, and NA-108 (Faisalabad) and NA-118 (Nankana Sahib) on Sept 25. 
According to a PML-N leader from Punjab Dawn spoke to on Wednesday, it has been decided in principle that the runner-up of these constituencies should be a joint candidate of the allies. Under this arrangement, the PPP’s candidate will run for the Multan seat whereas PML-N’s for the remaining seat. 
“On Multan seat, Ali Musa Gilani, son of Senate opposition leader Yousuf Raza Gilani, will contest and the PML-N local leadership has been directed to fully support him (Musa),” he said. 
PML-N’s Ghaffar Dogar had contested this seat in 2018 polls but stood third. Musa had lost to Zain Qureshi, son of PTI stalwart Shah Mahmood Qureshi, with a margin of 7,000 votes.  
“The 13-party PMLN led alliance believes that it will easily manage to win this seat going by the result of the 2018 election. Musa had then got 70,000 and Dogar 60,000 votes against Zain’s bagged 77,000,” the PML-N leader said. 
There are reports that Dogar is not canvassing for Musa and junior Gilani is not happy over this and complains to the PML-N leadership. Musa is facing a strong PTI candidate, Mehr Bano Qureshi, daughter of Shah Mahmood Qureshi. This seat fell vacant after Zain Qureshi won the provincial assembly seat.  
For NA-118 (Nankana Sahib), PML-N’s Shezra Mansab Ali is the joint candidate. She had lost to PTI’s retired Brig Ijaz Shah with a slim margin of over 2,000 in the 2018 election. The PPP’s candidate had bagged over 18,000 votes while Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan had emerged stronger in this constituency with about 50,000 votes. 
For NA-108 (Faisalabad), which was held by PTI’s Farukh Habib, Abid Sher Ali was the runner up in 2018 as he lost with a margin of 1,000 votes. But this time around Sher Ali seems to be in two minds whether to contest the by-poll or not. “In a few days the PML-N leadership will finalise the name of a suitable candidate,” the PML-N leader said.  
PTI chairman Imran Khan has already announced his candidature on all nine seats that fell vacant after the acceptance of resignations of PTI MNAs by the National Assembly speaker. However, the winning candidates of PTI like Farukh Habib and Ijaz Shah have also been directed to be ready to contest in case of last minute change.

11,Kamil told to approach ECP in Shujaat case,LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Wednesday rejected PML-Q leader Kamil Ali Agha’s plea against the Election...,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Wednesday rejected PML-Q leader Kamil Ali Agha’s plea against the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) decision to retain Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain as president of the party.
The LHC directed Mr Agha to approach the ECP with the plea as the commission had enough powers to decide the issue.
LHC Justice Shahid Karim said that looking into the election-related issues was not the prerogative of the courts and wrapped up the case after the petitioner agreed to approach the ECP.
Earlier, Agha had filed a petition with the court, seeking stay against the ECP decision to halt PML-Q intra-party polls for the slots of its president and secretary general.
Advocate Safdar Shaheen, representing the petitioner, stated that the party head Chaudhry Shujaat wrote a letter carrying illegal directives to the Punjab Assembly deputy speaker ahead of the election for Punjab chief minister’s office.
He said the party’s working committee had termed Mr Shujaat’s directives an undemocratic act and decided to remove him from the president’s slot. 
He said the party workers had also staged a protest demo outside the house of Chaudhry Shujaat and condemned the letter. 
He said the party chief was removed from the post and the central working committee announced election for the president’s office to be held on Aug 10. 
The petitioner stated that the ECP suspended the decision to hold intra-party polls without citing the meeting of the central executive committee. He maintained that the ECP’s decision to bar intra-party election was illegal and, therefore, its execution should be halted immediately.
The ECP on Friday retained Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain as PML-Q chief, who filed an application seeking a bar on the intra-party elections.
Barrister Umar Aslam, representing Shujaat, submitted before the ECP that Mr Agha, who is PML-Q Punjab secretary general, chaired the party’s meeting illegally and later announced intra-party elections.
He said the provincial office-bearers of any political party could not announce intra-party polls, bypassing the party head and central secretary general, according to the rules. He stated that the intra-party elections were scheduled for Aug 10 without the permission of the party president and secretary general.
Multiple seats case: The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Wednesday fixed for hearing a petition filed against PTI Chairman Imran Khan’s decision to contest elections on nine National Assembly (NA) seats.
Aman Taraqi Party Punjab President Advocate Mian Asif Mehmmod filed the petition and made federal government through the Cabinet Division secretary, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar through the law secretary, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) through Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja, and Imran party tp the case.
He said it had become “a lacuna to contest election on multiple seats by the candidates in the general elections and demanded that there was need to address the issue terming it a clear case of political exploitation. He said Mr Khan, PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and Aleem Khan had contested elections on more than one seat in the past.
He demanded that an amendment should be introduced in the constitution and a person should be bound to contest election for one seat.
The petitioner said as the ECP announced by-elections on nine seats, Mr Khan immediately announced his candidature for all the seats.
He said Mr Khan was already an MNA and he should not be allowed to contest the by-election against any seat. He said if Mr Khan won all the seats, he could retain just one seat and the national exchequer would have to face a huge financial loss.The petitioner said he was filing the application on the basis of public importance/interest to get the ambiguity in the law removed for the “larger interest of the nation”, adding that it needed to be heard in the “supreme interest of justice for the interest of the public at large”.
Furthermore, he requested the LHC to direct Imran not to contest any election of the parliament before the submission and acceptance of his resignation as an MNA.
The petition also called for a direction to be issued to the relevant respondents to amend the law so as to regulate the eligibility criteria of parliamentarians contesting the election.
Last week, the ECP had announced that by-elections on nine NA seats, vacated after PTI lawmakers’ resignation, will be held on September 25.
Justice Shahid Jamil Khan will hear the case on Thursday (today).

13,Partition Diary – a longing for revisiting hometown,One planned a year and a half back to record the memories of the elderly persons who witnessed the Partition of ...,"One planned a year and a half back to record the memories of the elderly persons who witnessed the Partition of India and bore it on their souls. The untold tales of the painful migration of 1947 should reach the common man. We have preserved on YouTube channel called ‘Partition Diary’ the stories of nearly 100 old men who now live in various places of Bahawalnagar and Pakpattan districts of Punjab (Pakistan).  
They migrated in summer of 1947 to Pakistan from Ferozepur, Fazilka, Abohar, Ganganagar, Muktsar, Moga, Malout, Hoshiarpur, Jalandhar, Dabwali, Sirsa, Rania and other areas of Eastern Punjab (India). Though seventy-five years are gone, the incidents of 1947 are still engraved on their hearts. They have clear memories of their hamlets.  
These old men were children of 10 to 15 years at time of the historic migration. Now those children have become old ones. During our talk with them we asked these ‘old children’ if they see their villages in dreams. Do they want to visit their villages if they have an opportunity any day? 
Lost in deep thoughts, some migrants fall silent as if it is a strange question for them. It seems they have not come across this question ever in their lives. Facing the question first time, they find themselves in a fix. Thinking about the strict visa policies of India and Pakistan, to visit their places in India seems impossible. They say sadly, ‘son, nobody would allow us to visit the native place.’ 
Eyes filled with tears of unfulfilled desire, they look gloomy. As if the train has left the station and destination has become only a dream. As if the string of a kite has slipped from a kid’s hands and he now stands in a shock. All elderly persons have strong wish to see their villages. For them it is nothing more than a fantasy to go to Indian side of border and see their native villages. 
No one of them has gone back to India to roam about in the native place. Reasons may be numerous but the biggest one is the cold relations of both neighbouring countries and their strict policies. As the renowned poet Gulzar aptly says that birds, streams and winds can cross the borders but we men can’t. They enjoy far more free life than humans. 
These old ones say that they see their villages in their daydreams. They left the homes in 1947 but homes have been residing in their hearts since then. Some people used to listen to Indian radio stations in the hope of listening to the name of their forefathers’ land. 
My colleague in the college, Mr Saqib Navid tells that his father had to migrate from his birthplace Jogewal (Punjab, India) to Pakpattan (Punjab, Pakistan). A big wound mark on his neck is a grim reminder of a fatal attack on his family on the way. Once he was watching a kabaddi match played between India and Pakistan on TV, he came to know through commentary that one of Indian players belonged to Jogewal, his lovely and beloved hamlet. He kept supporting and clapping for the player of his village till end of the match. It was a unique example of a migrant’s love for his native land. 
Baba Arif Dhuddhi now lives in Chak 27 SP near Pakpattan. Along with his family, he had to leave his village called Budhai in Muktsar district. Baba Arif states that his father, uncles and other members of the family used to recall Budhai frequently. They kept claiming till their last breath that one day they would return to Budhai and live there for good. Alas, they passed away and got buried along with their wishes. 
Baba Jahan Khan Mandal lives in a small hamlet called Idlana near Minchinabad (Bahawalnagar). He has seen 90 springs of his life. Faridsar (now Kesri Singh Pur, Ganganagar, India) was his native town where he spent first 15 years of his life. Then came 1947, and he had to leave his beloved town. Tears surge in his old narrow eyes when he informs that his grandfather, mother, maternal uncle, elder sister and some other relatives were buried in graveyard of Faridsar. They slept in the same soil in which they took birth. 
Baba Jahan Khan’s nine siblings are no more; he is alone in the last few years of his long life. Though his memory is awfully great, his eyesight is getting weaker day by day. He cries, ‘I wish I could see my Faridsar once before getting blind.’ 
Light of his eyes is going out with each passing moment. The fire of cherished wish of watching his Faridsar is still blazing in his heart and soul. His trembling voice shows that the flame of his hope would die down soon. 
Baba Muhammad Boota once lived in Chaina (Jaito Mandi, India) in pre-partition days. Now he lives in Kalyana, a big village in Pakpattan. He had to flee for his life as his village was attacked and many Muslims were brutally killed there. His relatives were murdered and many were lost for ever. Boota, his father, uncle and two cousins were the only survivors who escaped the deadly assault. They somehow managed to reach Pakistan. 
We uploaded the video of his memories on YouTube and a message popped up, stating that Boota’s cousin Khushi Muhammad also managed to run away from the murderous attack. His family now lives in Delianwali village near Chaina. After 75 years Baba Boota came to know that his brother was alive. Baba Boota says that I do not want to visit the place where my dear ones were butchered ruthlessly. And sometimes a strong wish urges me to see the place that was once mine and where our blood mixed up with our soil. 
Subhash Chopra, a journalist and writer, lives in Delhi. He was kind enough to talk to me online during outbreak of corona epidemic. His native home was situated on dhakki (mound) near shrine of Baba Farid in Pakpattan. He had just passed matriculation exams when he had to go through the ordeal of Partition. 
He got an opportunity to visit Pakpattan in 2004 about 57 years after Partition. He touched the worn-out walls of his home and also met his childhood friend Laddi. During his stay in Pakpattan, the owner of Mehran hotel refused to charge him the rent of the room. Local people showered a great deal of love on him. He wants to visit his city Pakpattan again if corona virus allows him to travel without restrictions. 
Sardar Girdeep Singh talked to us via internet from Karnal (India) and shared his bundles of memories. He was 16 when he had to leave his city Arifwala (Pakpattan). In pre-partition era, Singh’s family was one of the biggest landlord families of united Punjab. Gurdeep Singh is a nephew of well-known farmer Sardar Bahadur Sir Datar Singh. Sir Datar Singh got education of agriculture and dairy farming from England and established first dairy farm of united India near Montgomery (now Sahiwal). The British Raj awarded him the title of Sir in recognition of his services in dairy farming.  
Maneka Gandhi, the daughter-in-law of Indian ex-prime minister Indra Gandhi, is a granddaughter of Sir Datar Singh. The family owned hundreds of acres of land in Montgomery, Pakpattan and Arifwala. Their native village is Kalyana (Pakpattan). We uploaded a video of Kalyana and Chak Datar Singh on YouTube and Gurdeep Singh warmly contacted us. He was excited to watch his native land. He announced, ‘Chishti Sahib, you are Quaid-i-Azam for me as you have shown me my village.’ 
He told that he visited Arifwala with his wife in 2013 and went to their native homes called ‘Peeli Kothi’ (yellow house) and ‘Chitti kothi’ (white house). He was stupefied to see them after ages. The earth seemed to shiver beneath his footsteps. 
Gurdeep Singh’s father Sardar Sher Singh was a close friend of ex-prime minister of Pakistan Liaquat Ali Khan. Sher Singh’s family shifted to Liaquat Ali Khan’s mansion in Karnal and agricultural land of Khan was also allotted to the family. Gurdeep Singh said some family members of Khan visited their native place in Karnal in 1970. They prayed at graves of their elders and shed silent tears. Liaquat Ali’s daughter said, ‘I have two homelands, one is Pakistan and the other is this one in Karnal.’ 
Sardar Gurdeep Singh’s eyes filled with tears while he was sharing his old memories with us. He spoke with heavy voice, ‘Chishti Sahib, just open the borders and we would come running to our native land.’ 
Kaana Singh is a famous poet and writer whose work depicts her native town Gujjar Khan as a land of her dreams. Talking on video call, she said: “In her stories and poems drips the love for her birthplace. She visited her home few years ago and has intense longing to visit Gujjar Khan again and again.” 
All migrants miss their birthplaces a lot. Thousands of them have died with their unfulfilled wishes. Only a few are alive and they too do not have any hope of seeing their homes. India and Pakistan should open their borders for these elderly people. To cross the border and visit their villages is a pilgrimage for many of them.

Hearing the case, Justice Muzamil Akhtar Shabbir sought a reply from the Punjab chief secretary and the principal secretary till the next hearing on Aug 22.
Advocate Mian Dawood had filed a constitutional petition in the court on behalf of a citizen Akhtar Ali on Friday.
It has been argued in the petition that the appointment of the principal secretary to the chief minister was a violation of the Constitution and the law.
According to law, an officer of one service cadre cannot be posted in another service cadre.
The petitioner also said that two notifications were issued for the appointment of Muhammad Khan Bhatti as Principal Secretary. First, a simple notification of transfer and posting was issued and later, the second notification was about posting on deputation.
Both the notifications were issued before Parvaiz Elahi was sworn in as the chief minister.
The citizen also said that an `uneducated person’ has been appointed as the head of highly educated government officials, requesting the court to nullify the appointment of Muhammad Khan Bhatti.
The official in question is now a grade 22 officer, promoted from clerical ranks by Parvez Elahi over the years since he held positions like local government minister, Punjab Assembly speaker and chief minister during Gen Musharraf rule

19,‘Four mistakes in ECP funding case report’,LAHORE: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Secretary-General Asad Umer said on Wednesday the party had submitted a...,"LAHORE: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Secretary-General Asad Umer said on Wednesday the party had submitted a petition against the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP’s) report on the foreign funding case in the Islamabad High Court.
“It is not for the first time that decisions have been taken behind closed doors,” he said and added that ill-gotten money was used to hatch a foreign conspiracy. He said the National Security Committee had also acknowledged that foreign pressure was exerted to oust the PTI government from power corridors.
Speaking at a news conference at PTI’s Lahore office on Wednesday, Mr Umer said there were four mistakes in the ECP report that include the wrong presentation of facts and explanation of the relevant law. He said the ECP’s partiality against the PTI had become evident. He said overseas Pakistanis had given affidavits that they themselves had funded the party. He said Romita Shetty’s husband was Pakistani and he had given the funds to PTI.
He said Imran Khan had not given an affidavit but a certificate regarding the statement of funds put up by the party’s team looking after financial matters. He said the ECP was not a court but started an explanation of the law.
He said the ECP also wrote that it could not find out the source of Rs360 million in funding to the PPP, while the PML-N did not submit its accounts’ statements with the commission. He said 98 per cent source of Rs640 million funds to the PML-N was not available.
Mr Umer said the nation and Imran Khan stood together against the foreign conspiracy hatched behind closed doors and snatched Punjab’s rule from the ‘imported government’ through the power of votes in by-elections on July 17.
“The federal government is now baffled as the old political system has been hit hard,” he said and added that the ARY news channel transmission was suspended and a case was registered against the channel’s senior vice-president. He said the federal government was acting fiercely against everyone not toeing its ideology and narrative.
He said fake propaganda was being done to create a gulf between PTI and Pakistan Army.  
“The facts behind a boy’s tweets will be clear when investigations are made in the case,” he said.
He said the PTI would do its August 14 public meeting and political rivals’ dream of minus Imran Khan would never come true. He said neither there was any fear of Article 62-A nor Imran Khan could be knocked out on technical grounds.
